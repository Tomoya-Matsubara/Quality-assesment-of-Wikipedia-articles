<p>The <strong>Nashville Sounds</strong> are a <a href="minor_league_baseball" title="wikilink">minor league baseball</a> team of the <a href="Pacific_Coast_League" title="wikilink">Pacific Coast League</a> (PCL) and are the <a href="Minor_league_baseball#AAA" title="wikilink">Triple-A</a> affiliate of the <a href="Milwaukee_Brewers" title="wikilink">Milwaukee Brewers</a>. They are located in <a href="Nashville,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Nashville, Tennessee</a> and are named for the city's association with the <a href="music_industry" title="wikilink">music industry</a>. The team plays their home games at <a href="Herschel_Greer_Stadium" title="wikilink">Herschel Greer Stadium</a>, which opened in 1978 and holds 10,052 fans as of 2008.</p>
<p>Established as a <a href="Minor_league_baseball#AA" title="wikilink">Double-A</a> team in 1978, the Sounds moved up to the Triple-A level in 1985. The team has served as a <a href="farm_club" title="wikilink">farm club</a> for six major league franchises. A total of 21 <a href="manager_(baseball)" title="wikilink">managers</a> have helmed the club and its nearly 800 players. As of the completion of the 2007 season, the team has played in 4,297 regular season games and compiled a win&lt;U+2013&gt;loss record of 2,245&lt;U+2013&gt;2,052.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The team fielded in 1980 was recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The 2006 team tied the record for the longest game in PCL history. Of the three nine-inning perfect games in the history of the PCL, two have been pitched by members of the Sounds.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The Sounds won the PCL Championship in 2005, sweeping the <a href="Tacoma_Rainiers" title="wikilink">Tacoma Rainiers</a> in three games in the final series. Previous league titles won by the team are the <a href="Southern_League_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Southern League</a> title in 1979, as the Double-A affiliate of the <a href="Cincinnati_Reds" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Reds</a>, and again in 1982 as the Double-A affiliate of the <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a>.

<h3 id="reds-era-1978u20131979">Reds era (1978&lt;U+2013&gt;1979)</h3>
<p>Nashville's professional baseball history dates back to 1885, beginning with the <a href="Nashville_Americans" title="wikilink">Nashville Americans</a>. They were followed by the <a href="Nashville_Blues" title="wikilink">Blues</a>, <a href="Nashville_Tigers" title="wikilink">Tigers</a>, <a href="Nashville_Seraphs" title="wikilink">Seraphs</a>, and <a href="Nashville_Vols" title="wikilink">Vols</a>. The city was without a professional baseball team for 14 years after the <a href="Minor_league_baseball#AA" title="wikilink">Double-A</a> Vols ceased operations after their 1963 season. In 1978, the Nashville Sounds were added as an expansion franchise team in the Double-A <a href="Southern_League_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Southern League</a> and were affiliated with the <a href="Cincinnati_Reds" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Reds</a>.</p>
<p>President and part owner <a href="Larry_Schmittou" title="wikilink">Larry Schmittou</a>, head coach of the <a href="Vanderbilt_University" title="wikilink">Vanderbilt University</a> baseball team, was instrumental in bringing professional baseball back to Nashville. Schmittou's business philosophy revolved around earning profits not from ticket sales, but from the sale of souvenirs and concessions.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> This philosophy also involved promoting entertainment value, or fun, instead of promoting the baseball game.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> With the help of <a href="country_music" title="wikilink">country music</a> star <a href="Conway_Twitty" title="wikilink">Conway Twitty</a>, who heard about the proposed team in local newspapers, Schmittou brought in other recording artists such as <a href="Larry_Gatlin" title="wikilink">Larry Gatlin</a> and <a href="Jerry_Reed" title="wikilink">Jerry Reed</a>, as well as other Nashvillians, as Sounds <a href="shareholder" title="wikilink">shareholders</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="OriginalNashvilleSoundsLogo.png" title="fig:Original Sounds logo from 1978 to 1997" alt="Original Sounds logo from 1978 to 1997" /> The club played their home games at a new facility, <a href="Herschel_Greer_Stadium" title="wikilink">Herschel Greer Stadium</a>, located south of downtown Nashville at the foot of St. Cloud Hill in <a href="Fort_Negley" title="wikilink">Fort Negley Park</a>. Fans responded well to the return of baseball to the city, evidenced by Nashville leading the Southern League in attendance in each of their seven seasons as a member of the league.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In 1980, it set the all-time league attendance record (575,676).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The team's name, logo, and color scheme originated with the <a href="Memphis_Sounds" title="wikilink">Memphis Sounds</a> of the <a href="American_Basketball_Association" title="wikilink">American Basketball Association</a> (ABA), who used them for one season in 1974 before the team relocated and became the <a href="Baltimore_Claws" title="wikilink">Baltimore Claws</a>. When the ABA merged with the <a href="National_Basketball_Association" title="wikilink">National Basketball Association</a> in 1976, some of the copyrights were allowed to lapse, and Nashville's baseball team adopted the abandoned schemes.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The color blue was added to Memphis' red and white palate. The team&lt;U+2019&gt;s logo, which was used from 1978 to 1997, reflects the city's association with the <a href="country_music" title="wikilink">country music</a> industry. It depicts a mustachioed baseball player swinging at a <a href="baseball_(ball)" title="wikilink">baseball</a> with a guitar, a staple of country music, in place of a <a href="baseball_bat" title="wikilink">bat</a>. Further illustrating the city&lt;U+2019&gt;s musical ties is the typeface, with letters resembling <a href="note" title="wikilink">music notes</a>, used to display the team name.</p>
<p>The Sounds played their first home game, a 12&lt;U+2013&gt;4 victory, on April 26, 1978 against the <a href="Mississippi_Braves" title="wikilink">Savannah Braves</a> in front of a sellout crowd of 8,156 fans.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The home opener was scheduled to take place the previous evening, but was rained out.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The team requested to open the season on the road and had to swap a series with the <a href="Chattanooga_Lookouts" title="wikilink">Chattanooga Lookouts</a> in order to have enough time to complete the stadium.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Tractors and grading machines were still preparing the field on game day, and the electricity was turned on only five minutes before the gates opened.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The sod, which arrived late, was laid the day before the scheduled opening game with the help of an estimated group of 50 fans who heard an announcement from general manager Farrell Owenson on local radio stations inviting them to a &quot;sod party&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> As the Double-A affiliate of the Reds, the Sounds finished ninth during their inaugural campaign of 1978, but led all of minor league baseball in attendance by drawing 380,000 fans.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Under manager <a href="George_Scherger" title="wikilink">George Scherger</a>, the Sounds started the 1979 season poorly, before rallying to win 20 of 31 games in late May and June. They entered the last game of the first half in first place, but lost to their cross-state rivals, the <a href="Memphis_Chicks" title="wikilink">Memphis Chicks</a> and finished in second place. The Sounds and Chicks met again on the last day of the second half in a split <a href="doubleheader_(baseball)" title="wikilink">doubleheader</a>; both games were won by Nashville. The two teams then faced-off in a best-of-three series to determine the Western Division champion. The Sounds won the series two games to one before advancing to the Southern League championship series against the <a href="Carolina_Mudcats" title="wikilink">Columbus Astros</a>. Nashville captured the league title by defeating the Astros three games to one. Also in 1979, the team played host to the Southern League All-Star Game. The contest pitted a team of the league's all-stars against the major league <a href="Atlanta_Braves" title="wikilink">Atlanta Braves</a>. The all-stars defeated the Braves, five <a href="run_(baseball)" title="wikilink">runs</a> to two. Nashville's <a href="Duane_Walker" title="wikilink">Duane Walker</a> was named the MVP.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Originally, the Reds allowed Nashville to use a <a href="designated_hitter" title="wikilink">designated hitter</a> in their lineup. However, this allowance was later revoked, as the Reds were a part of the <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> which did not use a DH. President Larry Schmittou issued an ultimatum: if Cincinnati would not let them use the DH, they would not renew their contract and would look for a new major league affiliate. The Reds did not renege on their decision to prohibit the DH, so the Sounds looked for a new affiliate after 1979. Schmittou was then approached by five or six clubs looking to enter the Southern League as a Sounds affiliate.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="yankees-era-1980u20131984">Yankees era (1980&lt;U+2013&gt;1984)</h3>
<p>The Sounds made their first affiliation switch in 1980, becoming a part of the <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a> organization. Managers <a href="Stump_Merrill" title="wikilink">Stump Merrill</a> and <a href="Johnny_Oates" title="wikilink">Johnny Oates</a> and future major leaguers such as <a href="Steve_Balboni" title="wikilink">Steve Balboni</a>, <a href="Don_Mattingly" title="wikilink">Don Mattingly</a>, <a href="Buck_Showalter" title="wikilink">Buck Showalter</a>, <a href="Otis_Nixon" title="wikilink">Otis Nixon</a>, <a href="Willie_McGee" title="wikilink">Willie McGee</a>, <a href="Pat_Tabler" title="wikilink">Pat Tabler</a>, and <a href="Dan_Pasqua" title="wikilink">Dan Pasqua</a> helped lead Nashville to first or second-place divisional finishes from 1980 to 1984.</p>
<p>The 1980 Sounds finished the first half of the season one-and-a-half games behind the <a href="Memphis_Chicks" title="wikilink">Memphis Chicks</a>. In the second half, the team finished in first-place, fourteen games ahead of the second-place team. In the Western Division championship series, Nashville lost to Memphis, three games to one. Nine Southern League records were set during the season, the team's pitching staff led the league in <a href="Earned_run_average" title="wikilink">ERA</a> and <a href="strikeout" title="wikilink">strikeouts</a>, and Steve Balboni led the league in <a href="run_(baseball)" title="wikilink">runs</a>, <a href="home_run" title="wikilink">home runs</a>, and <a href="total_bases" title="wikilink">total bases</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The team also set a league attendance record, when a total of 575,676 fans visited Greer Stadium.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> As of the completion of the 2007 season, this record still stands.

<p>On April 16, 1981, the New York Yankees made a stop in Nashville to play an exhibition game against the Sounds. The 10&lt;U+2013&gt;1 Yankees victory was played in front of a standing room only crowd of 17,318 fans.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Also on hand for the game were Yankees owner <a href="George_Steinbrenner" title="wikilink">George Steinbrenner</a>, coach <a href="Yogi_Berra" title="wikilink">Yogi Berra</a>, and players <a href="Reggie_Jackson" title="wikilink">Reggie Jackson</a>, <a href="Bucky_Dent" title="wikilink">Bucky Dent</a>, <a href="Lou_Piniella" title="wikilink">Lou Piniella</a>, <a href="Bobby_Murcer" title="wikilink">Bobby Murcer</a>, <a href="Rich_Gossage" title="wikilink">Goose Gossage</a>, <a href="Tommy_John" title="wikilink">Tommy John</a>, and <a href="Johnny_Oates" title="wikilink">Johnny Oates</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The Sounds won the second half of the season and went on to win the Western Division championship after defeating the Memphis Chicks in three straight games. The team suffered in the best-of-five league championship series, falling to the <a href="Montgomery_Biscuits" title="wikilink">Orlando Twins</a>, 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1. Don Mattingly and Willie McGee, who both played for the Sounds in 1981, were later promoted to the major leagues. In 1985, Mattingly was named the <a href="American_League" title="wikilink">American League</a> <a href="Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" title="wikilink">Most Valuable Player</a> and McGee named the <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> MVP.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The following year, second half winner Nashville met the <a href="Tennessee_Smokies" title="wikilink">Knoxville Blue Jays</a> in the 1982 division playoffs. After defeating the Blue Jays, the Sounds advanced to the league championship series to play against the <a href="Jacksonville_Suns" title="wikilink">Jacksonville Suns</a>. Nashville defeated the Suns, three games to one, clinching the Southern League championship, giving the franchise their second league title.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The New York Yankees returned for another exhibition game against the Sounds on April 28, 1983. New York had a four-run lead going into the bottom of the ninth inning, but a five-run rally with two outs propelled the Sounds to a 5&lt;U+2013&gt;4 win in front of 13,641 fans.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Among the Yankees in attendance for the game were <a href="Billy_Martin" title="wikilink">Billy Martin</a>, <a href="Yogi_Berra" title="wikilink">Yogi Berra</a>, Goose Gossage, <a href="Ken_Griffey,_Sr." title="wikilink">Ken Griffey, Sr.</a>, <a href="Dave_Winfield" title="wikilink">Dave Winfield</a>, Lou Piniella, and <a href="Willie_Randolph" title="wikilink">Willie Randolph</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> During the season, manager <a href="Doug_Holmquist" title="wikilink">Doug Holmquist</a>, frustrated with the team's disappointing first half, instituted a system of fines for player infractions or poor performance on the field. The program ranged from a US$10 fine for a pitcher walking a batter with one on and two outs to a US$100 fine for missing curfew.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Rebounding, Nashville won the second half pennant, earning the team a shot at the Western Division championship. The Sounds, however, lost the fifth game of the best-of-five series to the <a href="Birmingham_Barons" title="wikilink">Birmingham Barons</a> by a score of seven runs to five, ending their season.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> On June 21, during a road trip to <a href="Orlando,_Florida" title="wikilink">Orlando, Florida</a>, teammates <a href="Scott_Bradley_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Scott Bradley</a>, <a href="Mike_Pagliarulo" title="wikilink">Mike Pagliarulo</a>, Erik Peterson, and Buck Showalter were walking back to their hotel when Peterson was hit by an automobile. When he began to convulse, Bradley put his fingers down Peterson&lt;U+2019&gt;s throat to keep him from swallowing his tongue. He survived, but with a bruised leg and several lacerations to the head, and he returned to play later in the season.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The Southern League All-Star Game returned to Nashville in 1983. Not only did the Sounds host the event, but they also served as the all-star team's competition. The all-stars recorded the victory with a score of three runs to two.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The Sounds were one game shy of winning the first half pennant in 1984. Winning the first half title is something that eluded the team during its entire seven year span at the Double-A level. Nashville captured the second half title, however, for the sixth consecutive season, after defeating Knoxville in a playoff game. The two teams met again in the divisional playoffs, but Knoxville emerged the victor, ending the Sounds' season. One important highlight of the first half of 1984 took place on May 4, when <a href="Jim_Deshaies" title="wikilink">Jim Deshaies</a> pitched the club&lt;U+2019&gt;s first <a href="no-hitter" class="uri" title="wikilink">no-hitter</a> against the <a href="Carolina_Mudcats" title="wikilink">Columbus Astros</a> in the second game of a seven-inning <a href="doubleheader_(baseball)" title="wikilink">doubleheader</a>. The 5&lt;U+2013&gt;1 Sounds victory was cut short of being a perfect game following three <a href="Base_on_balls" title="wikilink">walks</a> and a batter being <a href="hit_by_pitch" title="wikilink">hit by a pitch</a>, advancing the runner home for the only Astros <a href="run_(baseball)" title="wikilink">run</a> of the game.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="tigers-era-1985u20131986">Tigers era (1985&lt;U+2013&gt;1986)</h3>
<p>In 1983, Sounds President <a href="Larry_Schmittou" title="wikilink">Larry Schmittou</a> noticed a 5% drop in season ticket sales, a higher ratio of no-shows from season ticket holders, and a slight decline in overall attendance.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> These issues with spectator turnout were accompanied by a decline in local media coverage, particularly in regard to road games. In order to boost interest in the team, Schmittou tried, unsuccessfully, to purchase a <a href="Minor_league_baseball#AAA" title="wikilink">Triple-A</a> franchise late in the 1983 season. Attendance continued to drop in 1984, as season ticket sales were down 12% and overall attendance was down almost 20%.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Schmittou and team owners arrived at terms in June 1984 to purchase the <a href="Evansville_Triplets" title="wikilink">Evansville Triplets</a> of the <a href="American_Association_(20th_century)" title="wikilink">American Association</a>, with plans to move the franchise from <a href="Evansville,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Evansville, Indiana</a>, to Nashville for the 1985 season. In order to prove to the team's Nashville banks, which would back the purchase, that the move was financially viable, Schmittou commissioned a survey to evaluate the potential turnout for a Triple-A team versus a <a href="Minor_league_baseball#AA" title="wikilink">Double-A</a> team. Though the research proved to team owners that the move was a sensible decision, the banks were not impressed. As a result, the team switched banks and went ahead with the purchase and relocation.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Nashville&lt;U+2019&gt;s existing <a href="Southern_League_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Southern League</a> franchise was moved to <a href="Huntsville,_Alabama" title="wikilink">Huntsville, Alabama</a>, where it became the <a href="Huntsville_Stars" title="wikilink">Huntsville Stars</a>. The Triplets' legacy was retired, and the team was moved to Nashville. The Triple-A Sounds carried on the history of the Double-A team that preceded it.</p>
<p>The Sounds entered the Triple-A playing level as affiliates of the <a href="Detroit_Tigers" title="wikilink">Detroit Tigers</a> in 1985. On July 17, <a href="Bryan_Kelly_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Bryan Kelly</a> pitched the club&lt;U+2019&gt;s second <a href="no-hitter" class="uri" title="wikilink">no-hitter</a> against the <a href="Oklahoma_RedHawks" title="wikilink">Oklahoma City 89ers</a>, a 6&lt;U+2013&gt;0 win.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Nashville ended the season in second-place in the Eastern Division, missing out on finishing in first-place by two and a half games.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1986, Nashville finished third in their division with a 68&lt;U+2013&gt;74 regular season record,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> their first losing season since the inaugural 1978 campaign. Also that season, the Sounds were enlisted to serve as the competition in the Southern League All-Star Game, held in Huntsville, Alabama. The game was won by Nashville with a score of four runs to two.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="reds-era-part-ii-1987u20131992">Reds era, part II (1987&lt;U+2013&gt;1992)</h3>
<p>The Sounds rejoined the <a href="Cincinnati_Reds" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Reds</a> farm system in 1987, this time as their Triple-A affiliate. As a result, a number of minor leaguers played in the Reds organization at two different levels with Nashville. Spending the beginning of the 1987 season around the top of the standings, the team hit a slump after losing a few key players mid-season. The result was a 64&lt;U+2013&gt;76 record and a last place finish.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> One player lost due to injuries was third baseman <a href="Chris_Sabo" title="wikilink">Chris Sabo</a>.

<p>The 1988 Sounds were in last-place and had a losing record until making numerous management changes late in the season. During a two-week period in July and August 1988, the Sounds went through five different managers. The team started the season with <a href="Jack_Lind" title="wikilink">Jack Lind</a>, who left due to health problems.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> His position was filled on an interim basis by pitching coach <a href="Wayne_Garland" title="wikilink">Wayne Garland</a> until former manager <a href="George_Scherger" title="wikilink">George Scherger</a>, manager of the 1979 Southern League championship Sounds, was brought in. He retired after one game and was replaced by <a href="Jim_Hoff" title="wikilink">Jim Hoff</a>, who stayed a few days before taking up a position with the Reds' front office.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Finally, former <a href="Texas_Rangers_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Texas Rangers</a> manager <a href="Frank_Lucchesi" title="wikilink">Frank Lucchesi</a> was hired to lead the Sounds for the rest of the season.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Lucchesi managed the team's last 39 games, leading them to a final record of 73&lt;U+2013&gt;69.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> They finished second in the East Division and were out of the playoffs.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Greer Stadium was home to a rare baseball occurrence on August 6 and August 7, 1988, when Nashville and the <a href="Indianapolis_Indians" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Indians</a> exchanged <a href="no-hitter" title="wikilink">no-hitters</a> on back-to-back nights.

In addition to a new affiliation, the 1993 season also brought the addition of Greer Stadium's signature guitar-shaped scoreboard.

Sounds owner <a href="Larry_Schmittou" title="wikilink">Larry Schmittou</a> offered Greer Stadium as a temporary home for the team. In order to accommodate an additional team at Greer, the Xpress scheduled its home games during the Sounds&lt;U+2019&gt; road trips. <em><a href="Baseball_America" title="wikilink">Baseball America</a></em> ranked the dual Nashville teams as number one on its list of the &quot;top 10 happenings in minor league baseball.&quot;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> In 1995, the Xpress relocated to <a href="Wilmington,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Wilmington, North Carolina</a> and became the <a href="Port_City_Roosters" title="wikilink">Port City Roosters</a>.</p>

The venue has experienced numerous expansions and contractions since its completion in 1978. The stadium currently seats 10,052 spectators.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Its best known feature is its giant  guitar-shaped <a href="scoreboard" class="uri" title="wikilink">scoreboard</a> behind the left field wall.</p>
<p>In recent years, following the construction of newer, relatively luxurious minor league ballparks, Greer has fallen below standards set for Triple-A stadiums by professional baseball. It has been the subject of many renovations and upgrades in order to meet current Triple-A standards. Prior to the 2008 season, more than <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">US$</a>1 million in upgrades and repairs were made to the stadium.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> The improvements, which included a new clubhouse, improved field lighting, and improvements to restrooms, walkways, and seating, were made in order to keep the stadium functional for another three to five years.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> The team's current lease, as the stadium is owned by the city, expires after the 2008 season.</p>

<p>The Sounds and private developers Struever Brothers, Eccles, &amp; Rouse were unable to finalize financing and design plans for the new stadium by the April 15, 2007, deadline set by the Nashville Metro Council. As a result, the First Tennessee Field construction project was canceled. In the meantime, numerous upgrades and repairs have been made to Greer in order to preserve its functionality until a new stadium can be built.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>On January 31, 2008, Tennessee House Bill 4183/Senate Bill 4120, designed to assist Double-A, Triple-A, and major league teams in covering debt incurred by the construction of a new stadium, was introduced in the <a href="Tennessee_General_Assembly" title="wikilink">Tennessee General Assembly</a>. If the bill had become law, it would have granted a portion of state and local sales tax revenue generated by the stadium and adjoining hotels and restaurants to the entity responsible for retirement of the debt for a period of 30 years or until the debt was paid, whichever were to occur first.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Such a law would have aided the Sounds with the financing of a new stadium; problems with financing were a primary reason that the First Tennessee Field project was canceled.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> After a Senate Tax Subcommittee gave the bill its positive recommendation, the city responded by calling the effort &quot;an act of bad faith&quot; by the Sounds.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> On May 9, the team dropped its efforts to get the bill passed into law, but reiterated its desire to build a new ballpark in the city.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>

Jerseys and pants for home games are made of white fabric, while those for road games are made of gray fabric. The sleeveless jerseys have red and black piping around the neck and along the row of buttons going up the chest. Pants have the same piping going down the legs on the outside. On home jerseys, the word &quot;Sounds&quot; is written across the chest in red script surrounded by black. A <a href="Milwaukee_Brewers" title="wikilink">Milwaukee Brewers</a> logo is located on the front left shoulder. The player&lt;U+2019&gt;s name is written on the back in black block characters; numbers are also displayed in large red characters surrounded by black. Black t-shirts, short or long sleeve, are worn underneath the jerseys.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Road jerseys are the same, but with &quot;Nashville&quot; across the chest in the same style; they also lack the player's name on the back.

<p>The team&lt;U+2019&gt;s alternate uniform is identical to the home outfit, except it is worn with the team&lt;U+2019&gt;s batting practice jerseys and a different cap. This jersey is made of red mesh with a single line of black piping going down the sleeves and across the shoulders to the neck. &quot;Sounds&quot; is written across the chest in white script surrounded by black. There are black ventilation stripes located at the armpits, and a Brewers logo on the front left shoulder. Numbers, in white surrounded by black, are sewn on the back in block characters.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> The alternate uniform is worn with either the regular home/road black cap or the team&lt;U+2019&gt;s red batting practice cap which bears a yellow and white version of the music note logo.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="past">Past</h3>
<p>Originally, the team&lt;U+2019&gt;s color scheme consisted of red, white, and blue. Uniforms utilizing this palate were worn from 1978 to 1998. During this time, the team wore two major styles of uniforms: pullover jerseys and button up jerseys. Each of these styles experienced a number of minor design alterations from season to season.</p>
<p>The pullover v-neck jerseys, worn by the team from 1978 to 1986, were made of white fabric, for home games, and red or blue, for road games or as alternates. They carried bands of red, white, and blue around the neck, with larger bands at the end of the sleeves (the blue version had one thin white band and two large red bands). The team&lt;U+2019&gt;s pants were white and also displayed these stripes along the sides (small stripes) and at the waistband (large stripes). The word &quot;Sounds&quot; was written across the chest in two-color music note-like script. Numbers were sewn on the back of jerseys.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Beginning circa 1985, numbers were also located on the front of jerseys on the player&lt;U+2019&gt;s left chest, below the team name.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> The team wore a blue cap with red brim, displaying an &quot;N&quot; styled like a music note in white, bordered by red; this was the official team cap from 1978 to 1995.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
<p>From 1987 to 1998, the team&lt;U+2019&gt;s uniforms featured button up jerseys made of white fabric, for home games, and gray, for road games. Small bands of red, white, and blue appeared at the openings of the sleeves and along the sides of the team&lt;U+2019&gt;s pants. The word &quot;Sounds&quot; was written across the chest in blue music note-like script, with a red border; the font was changed briefly from 1987 to 1988. Numbers were present on the front of jerseys below the team name on the player&lt;U+2019&gt;s left chest in blue block characters surrounded by red.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> The back of the jersey carried the player&lt;U+2019&gt;s number; during some years, names were also present. Road jerseys had &quot;Nashville&quot; written across the chest and were missing the tri-color bands.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> The original cap was worn with this uniform until 1995 when the bill was changed to blue and the guitar-swinger logo was added to accompany the &lt;U+201C&gt;N.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p>The team switched to its current black, red, and white color scheme over the course of the 1998 and 1999 seasons.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> In the latter season, uniforms consisted of pinstriped pants and button up jerseys, with black sleeves carrying a music note logo on the left sleeve.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> By 2004, the team switched to pants and jerseys almost identical to the current designs. These sleeved jerseys differed in that they carried red and black piping around sleeve openings, a music note logo on the left sleeve, and numbers on the front of jerseys below the team name; they also lacked the logo of their parent club on the chest.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="radio-and-television">Radio and television</h2>

<p>During the opening season of 1978, Nashville Sounds games were broadcast on <a href="WMTS-FM" title="wikilink">WMTS</a> 96.3 FM by announcer and station owner, <a href="Monte_Hale_(broadcaster)" title="wikilink">Monte Hale</a>. He died following the inaugural season, after which Bob Jamison was hired for the 1979 season. Jamison remained the voice of the Sounds through 1990 when he was hired as the radio broadcaster for the <a href="Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim" title="wikilink">California Angels</a>. For the 1991 season, the Sounds hired former <a href="Huntsville_Stars" title="wikilink">Huntsville Stars</a> and <a href="Iowa_Cubs" title="wikilink">Iowa Cubs</a> broadcaster <a href="Steve_Carroll" title="wikilink">Steve Carroll</a>. After 1995, Carroll left to become the radio voice of the <a href="National_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">NHL's</a> <a href="Philadelphia_Flyers" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Flyers</a> and, later, the <a href="Anaheim_Ducks" title="wikilink">Mighty Ducks of Anaheim</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Steve_Selby" title="wikilink">Steve Selby</a> served as the voice of the Sounds from 1996 to 1999. He was joined on-air by fellow commentator <a href="Mike_Capps_(broadcaster)" title="wikilink">Mike Capps</a> for the 1997 season. <a href="Chuck_Valenches" title="wikilink">Chuck Valenches</a> replaced Capps as the assistant broadcaster in 1998 and was promoted to the role of lead broadcaster at the beginning of 2000, where he remains as of 2008. Valenches is frequently joined on the air at home by <a href="Pete_Weber_(broadcaster)" title="wikilink">Pete Weber</a>, the voice of the <a href="Nashville_Predators" title="wikilink">Nashville Predators</a>, and John Melton, a former catcher in the <a href="Arizona_Diamondbacks" title="wikilink">Arizona Diamondbacks</a> system.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> As of 2008, Sounds games are broadcast on <a href="WNSR" class="uri" title="wikilink">WNSR</a> 560 AM, and online via the team and Minor League Baseball websites.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
<p>Sounds home games were regularly televised by <a href="WZTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">WZTV</a> from 1982 to 1992. A few games were also aired by <a href="WNPX" class="uri" title="wikilink">WNPX</a> in 1999.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> As of 2008, Sounds games are not broadcast on television. However, select road games are streamed through the MiLB.TV feature of the official website of Minor League Baseball. A monthly television program, called <em>Sounds On Demand</em>, which has aired since 2005,<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> airs throughout <a href="Middle_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Middle Tennessee</a> on <a href="Comcast" class="uri" title="wikilink">Comcast</a> cable channel 49, and is also available &quot;<a href="Video_on_demand" title="wikilink">On Demand</a>&quot; through Comcast Digital Cable programming.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> The thirty-minute show, hosted by Chuck Valenches, features player interviews, team news, tips from players on how to play the game, and other related content.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="mascots">Mascots</h2>
<p><img src="Nashville_Sounds_Mascot_Ozzie.jpg" title="fig:Ozzie, mascot of the Nashville Sounds" alt="Ozzie, mascot of the Nashville Sounds" /> The Nashville Sounds' <a href="mascot" class="uri" title="wikilink">mascot</a> is an <a href="anthropomorphism" title="wikilink">anthropomorphic</a> cougar named Ozzie. He has yellow fur and wears the same style of uniform as the team, but with no hat. In addition to the team's current home and alternate uniforms, he also wears versions of their home uniforms from the past few seasons.</p>
<p>The first Sounds mascot was introduced during the team's inaugural 1978 season. Homer Horsehide, whose name was selected in a naming contest, resembled their major league affiliate's mascot&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="Mr._Red" title="wikilink">Mr. Red</a> of the <a href="Cincinnati_Reds" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Reds</a>. The character was human in appearance, with the exception of an oversized anthropomorphized baseball in place of a human head. The mustachioed mascot donned a uniform identical to that of Sounds players.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<p>Prior to Ozzie, a lime-green dinosaur named Champ was the team's mascot.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> His short-lived time as a mascot began and ended in 1996. Following altercations with team management and league personnel during games, Champ, vis-&lt;U+00E0&gt;-vis his performer, did not return for the 1997 season.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<p>When Amerisports Companies LLC, the current ownership group, took control of the team in April 1997, they decided that a new mascot was needed. Since the group also owned the <a href="Minor_league_baseball#.22Low.22_A" title="wikilink">Class A</a> <a href="Kane_County_Cougars" title="wikilink">Kane County Cougars</a> minor league team, which had an extra mascot uniform, the surplus cougar outfit was sent to Nashville. After building a fan following during Ozzie&lt;U+2019&gt;s first season, team management decided to make him the permanent team mascot.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> Initially, the Ozzie costume was identical to the brown cougar costume still in use by Kane County, but was later replaced by the current yellow outfit in 1998.</p>
<h2 id="faith-nights">Faith Nights</h2>

</figure>
<p>In addition to promotions that are synonymous with minor league baseball like theme nights, fireworks night, and discounted ticket or concessions night, the Nashville Sounds also host what is called Faith Night. In 2002, the Sounds became the first sports team to host Faith Night promotions.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> These <a href="Christianity" title="wikilink">Christian</a>-based promotional evenings include pre-game concerts from Christian music artists, <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a>-themed <a href="bobblehead" class="uri" title="wikilink">bobblehead</a> giveaways, and <a href="Testimony#Religious_testimony" title="wikilink">testimonials</a> from players about their faith. Artists performing at Nashville's Greer Stadium in the past include <a href="Jars_of_Clay" title="wikilink">Jars of Clay</a>, <a href="Hawk_Nelson" title="wikilink">Hawk Nelson</a>, and <a href="Matthew_West_(musician)" title="wikilink">Matthew West</a>. Brent High, then Vice President of Sales for the Sounds, and Mike Snider, the President and owner of Third Coast Sports, an entertainment and sports marketing firm in Nashville, are credited with developing the promotion.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a></p>
<p>Since their inception, Faith Nights have been among the top-ten most-attended games each season.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> During Faith Nights in 2004, the Sounds experienced a 93% increase in attendance over their average season attendance for non-Faith Night dates; over 500 church groups attended these games.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> That fall, the team partnered with the Nashville Area <a href="Habitat_for_Humanity_International" title="wikilink">Habitat for Humanity</a> to build a home for a needy family. The team raised more than $45,000 from 10% of ticket proceeds and collections during Faith Nights.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
<p>The promotion has since been adopted by at least 40 other minor league teams. It has also been used by major league teams such as the <a href="Atlanta_Braves" title="wikilink">Atlanta Braves</a> and <a href="St._Louis_Cardinals" title="wikilink">St. Louis Cardinals</a>. Teams from the <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a> and <a href="National_Basketball_Association" title="wikilink">National Basketball Association</a> have also shown interest in holding Faith Night promotions.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> The program has garnered national media attention for the Sounds from <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> and <a href="National_Public_Radio" title="wikilink">National Public Radio</a>.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a><a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>

<p>Nashville has honored two of its players by <a href="Uniform_number_(Major_League_Baseball)#Retirement_of_Numbers" title="wikilink">retiring</a> their <a href="Squad_number#Baseball" title="wikilink">uniform numbers</a>. When a number is retired, no player on the team may wear that number in the future. This ensures that the number will be associated with one player of particular importance to the team.</p>
