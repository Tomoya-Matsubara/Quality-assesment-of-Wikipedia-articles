<p>The <strong>Pony Express</strong> was a fast <a href="mail" class="uri" title="wikilink">mail</a> service crossing the <a href="Great_Plains" title="wikilink">Great Plains</a>, the <a href="Rocky_Mountains" title="wikilink">Rocky Mountains</a>, and the <a href="Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)" title="wikilink">High Sierra</a> from <a href="St._Joseph,_Missouri" title="wikilink">St. Joseph, Missouri</a>, to <a href="Sacramento,_California" title="wikilink">Sacramento, California</a>, from April 3, 1860 to October 1861. It became the west's most direct means of east-west communication before the <a href="First_Transcontinental_Telegraph" title="wikilink">telegraph</a> and was vital for tying <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> closely with <a href="Union_(American_Civil_War)" title="wikilink">the Union</a> just before the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a>.</p>
<p>The Pony Express was a mail delivery system of the Leavenworth and Pike's Peak Express Company of 1849 which in 1850 became the <a href="Central_Overland_California_and_Pikes_Peak_Express_Company" title="wikilink">Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company</a>. This firm was founded by <a href="William_Hepburn_Russell" title="wikilink">William H. Russell</a>, <a href="Alexander_Majors" title="wikilink">Alexander Majors</a>, and <a href="William_B._Waddell_(Pony_Express_founder)" title="wikilink">William B. Waddell</a> all of whom were notable in the freighting business.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Patee_House" title="wikilink">Patee House</a> served as the Pony Express headquarters from 1860 to 1861. It is one block away from the home of infamous outlaw <a href="Jesse_James" title="wikilink">Jesse James</a>, where he was shot and killed by <a href="Robert_Ford_(outlaw)" title="wikilink">Robert Ford</a>.</p>
<p>This original fast mail 'Pony Express' service had messages <a href="mail_delivery_by_animal" title="wikilink">carried by horseback riders</a> in <a href="Stagecoach#Description" title="wikilink">staged</a> relays to stations (with fresh horses and riders) across the prairies, plains, deserts, and mountains of the <a href="Western_United_States" title="wikilink">Western United States</a>. During its 18 months of operation, it reduced the time for messages to travel between the <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic</a> and <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">Pacific</a> coasts to about ten days, with telegraphic communication covering about half the distance across the continent and mounted couriers the rest.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The idea of a fast mail route to the Pacific coast was prompted largely by California's new found prominence and its rapidly growing population. After gold had been discovered there in 1848 thousands of prospectors, investors and businessmen made their way to the <a href="California_Republic" title="wikilink">California Republic</a>. By 1850 California entered the Union as a free state. By 1860 the population had grown to 380,000.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The demand for a faster way to get mail and other communications to and from this western most state became even greater as the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a> approached.</p>
<p>William Russell, Alexander Majors and William Waddell were the three founders of the Pony Express and were already in the freighting business in the late 1850s with more than 4,000 men, 3,500 wagons and some 40,000 oxen.</p>
<p>Russell was a prominent business man and well respected among his peers and the community. Waddell was co-owner of the firm 'Morehead, Waddell &amp; Co.'. After Morehead was bought out and retired Waddell merged his company with Russell's, changing the name to 'Waddell &amp; Russell'. In 1855 they took on a new partner, Alexander Majors, and founded the company of Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> They held government contracts for delivering army supplies to the West frontier, and Russell had a similar idea for contracts with the U.S. Government for fast mail delivery. <img src="Pony_Express_Messenger&#39;s_Badge2.jpg" title="fig:Replica of Pony Express Messenger&#39;s Badge" alt="Replica of Pony Express Messenger&#39;s Badge" width="180" /> By having a short route and using mounted riders rather than traditional <a href="stagecoach" title="wikilink">stagecoaches</a>, their proposal was to establish a fast mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California with letters delivered in 10 days, a duration many said was impossible. The price was $5 per half-ounce. The founders of the Pony Express hoped to win an exclusive government mail contract, but that did not come about.</p>
<p>Russell, Majors and Waddell organized and put together the Pony Express in two months in the winter of 1860. The undertaking involved 120 riders, 184 stations, 400 horses and several hundred personnel during January and February 1860.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Alexander Majors was a religious man and resolved &quot;by the help of God&quot; to overcome all difficulties. He presented each rider with a Bible and required this oath:<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> </p>

<p>Pony Express demonstrated that a unified transcontinental system could be built and operated continuously year round. Since its replacement by the telegraph, the Pony Express has become part of the lore of the <a href="American_Old_West" title="wikilink">American West</a>. Its reliance on the ability and endurance of individual riders and horses over technological innovation was part of the American rugged individualism of the <a href="Frontier_Thesis" title="wikilink">Frontier</a> times.</p>
<p>From 1866 until 1890, the Pony Express logo was used by <a href="Wells_Fargo" title="wikilink">Wells Fargo</a>, which provided secure mail and freight services. The <a href="United_States_Postal_Service" title="wikilink">United States Postal Service</a> (USPS) used &quot;Pony Express&quot; as a trademark for postal services in the US.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <a href="Freight_Link" title="wikilink">Freight Link</a> international <a href="Courier" title="wikilink">courier services</a>, based in <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a>, adopted the Pony Express trademark and a logo similar to that of the USPS.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1860 there were about 157 Pony Express stations that were about 10 miles (16Â km) apart along the Pony Express route.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This was roughly the distance a horse could travel at a gallop before tiring. At each station stop the express rider would change to a fresh horse, taking only the mail pouch called a <em>mochila</em> (from the <a href="Spanish_Language" title="wikilink">Spanish</a> for pouch or backpack) with him. The employers stressed the importance of the pouch. They often said that, if it came to be, the horse and rider should perish before the mochila did. The <em>mochila</em> was thrown over the saddle and held in place by the weight of the rider sitting on it. Each corner had a <em>cantina</em>, or pocket. Bundles of mail were placed in these <em>cantinas</em>, which were padlocked for safety. The <em>mochila</em> could hold  of mail along with the  of material carried on the horse. Included in that  were a water sack, a Bible, a horn for alerting the relay station master to prepare the next horse, a revolver, and a choice of a rifle or another revolver.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Eventually, everything except one revolver and a water sack was removed, allowing for a total of  on the horse's back. Riders, who could not weigh over , changed about every , and rode day and night. In emergencies, a given rider might ride two stages back to back, over 20 hours on a quickly moving horse.</p>
<p>It is unknown if riders tried crossing the <a href="Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)" title="wikilink">Sierra Nevada</a> in winter, but they certainly crossed central Nevada. By 1860 there was a telegraph station in <a href="Carson_City,_Nevada" title="wikilink">Carson City, Nevada</a>. The riders received $25 per week as pay. A comparable wage for unskilled labor at the time was about $1 per week.</p>
<p>Alexander Majors, one of the founders of the Pony Express, had acquired more than 400 horses for the project. He selected horses from around the west, paying an average of $200.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> These averaged about  <a href="Hand_(length)" title="wikilink">hands</a> () high and averaged <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> each; thus, the name <a href="pony" class="uri" title="wikilink">pony</a> was appropriate, even if not strictly correct in all cases. </p>
<h2 id="pony-express-route">Pony Express route</h2>
<p>The approximately  route<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> roughly followed the <a href="Oregon_Trail" title="wikilink">Oregon</a> and <a href="California_Trail" title="wikilink">California Trails</a> to <a href="Fort_Bridger" title="wikilink">Fort Bridger</a> in <a href="Wyoming" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wyoming</a>, and then the <a href="Mormon_Trail" title="wikilink">Mormon Trail</a> (known as the <a href="Hastings_Cutoff" title="wikilink">Hastings Cutoff</a>) to <a href="Salt_Lake_City,_Utah" title="wikilink">Salt Lake City, Utah</a>. From there it roughly followed the <a href="Central_Nevada_Route" title="wikilink">Central Nevada Route</a> to <a href="Carson_City,_Nevada" title="wikilink">Carson City, Nevada</a> before passing over the Sierras into <a href="Sacramento,_California" title="wikilink">Sacramento, California</a>.</p>

From Salt Lake City it generally followed the <a href="Central_Nevada_Route" title="wikilink">Central Nevada Route</a> blazed by Captain <a href="James_H._Simpson" title="wikilink">James H. Simpson</a> of the <a href="United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers#History" title="wikilink">Corps of Topographical Engineers</a> in 1859.

It crossed the <a href="Great_Basin" title="wikilink">Great Basin</a>, the <a href="Central_Nevada_Route" title="wikilink">Utah-Nevada Desert</a>, and the <a href="Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)" title="wikilink">Sierra Nevada</a> near <a href="Lake_Tahoe" title="wikilink">Lake Tahoe</a> before arriving in <a href="Sacramento" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sacramento</a>. Mail was then sent via steamer down the <a href="Sacramento_River" title="wikilink">Sacramento River</a> to San Francisco. On a few instances when the steamer was missed, riders took the mail via horseback to <a href="Oakland,_California" title="wikilink">Oakland, California</a>.</p>
<h3 id="stations">Stations</h3>
<p>There were 184 stations along the long and arduous route used by the Pony Express. The stations and station keepers were essential to the successful, timely and smooth operation of the Pony Express mail system. They were often fashioned out of existing structures, several of the them located in military forts, while others were built anew in remote areas where living conditions were very basic.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The route was divided up into five Divisions. To maintain the rigid schedule, 157 relay stations were located from  apart as the terrain would allow for. At each <em>Swing Station</em> riders would exchange their tired mounts for fresh ones, while Home Stations provided room and board for the riders between runs. This technique allowed the mail to be whisked across the continent in record time. Each rider rode about  per day.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>The first Westbound Pony Express</strong> trip left St. Joseph on April 3, 1860 and arrived ten days later in San Francisco, California on April 14. These letters were sent under cover from the East to St. Joseph, and never directly entered the U.S. mail system. To this day there is only a single letter known to exist from the inaugural westbound trip from St. Joseph, Missouri to San Francisco, California.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The mailing depicted below is on a pre-stamped (embossed) envelope, first issued by the U.S. Post Office in 1855, used five years later here.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>The messenger delivering the <em>mochila</em> from New York and Washington, DC missed a connection in Detroit and arrived in <a href="Hannibal,_Missouri" title="wikilink">Hannibal, Missouri</a>, two hours late.

The first pouch contained 49 letters, five private telegrams, and some papers for San Francisco and intermediate points.</p>

<p>The identity of the first rider has long been in dispute. The St. Joseph <em>Weekly West</em> (April 4, 1860) reported <a href="Johnson_William_Richardson" title="wikilink">Johnson William Richardson</a> was the first rider. <a href="Johnny_Fry" title="wikilink">Johnny Fry</a> is credited in some sources as the rider. Nonetheless, the first westbound rider carried the pouch across the Missouri River ferry to <a href="Elwood,_Kansas" title="wikilink">Elwood, Kansas</a>. The first horse-ridden leg of the Express was only about a  from the Express stables/railroad area to the Missouri River ferry at the foot of Jules Street. Reports indicated that horse and rider crossed the river. In later rides, the courier crossed the river without a horse and picked up his mount at a stable on the other side.</p>

Also contributing to the scarcity of surviving Pony Express mail was the fact that the cost to send a 1/2 ounce letter was $5.00<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> at the beginning, a costly sum in those days and mostly unaffordable to the general public. By the end period of the Pony Express, the price had dropped to $1.00 per 1/2 ounce. Even the $1.00 rate was considered a lot of money ($26 in 2012 U.S. Dollars)<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> just to mail one letter in those days. As this mail service was also a frontier enterprise, removed from the general population back east, along with the largely unaffordable rates, there are consequently few pieces of surviving Pony Express mail in the hands of collectors and museums today. Presently there are only 250 known examples of Pony Express mail.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1860, senior partner of 'Russell, Majors, and Waddell.', William Russell, one of the biggest investors in the Pony Express, used the 1860 presidential election as a way to promote the Pony Express and how fast it could deliver the U.S. Mail. Assuring that there would be fresh riders and horses along the entire Pony Express route, Russell, prior to the election, hired extra riders and ensured that fresh relay horses were available along the route. On November 7, 1860, a Pony Express rider departed <a href="Fort_Kearny" title="wikilink">Fort Kearny</a>, Nebraska Territory (the eastern end of the telegraph line) with the election results. Riders sped along the route, over snow-covered trails and into Fort Churchill, Nevada Territory (the western end of the telegraph line). California&lt;U+2019&gt;s newspapers received word of Lincoln&lt;U+2019&gt;s election only seven days and 17 hours after the East Coast papers, an unrivaled feat at the time.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="Paiute_War" title="wikilink">Paiute War</a> was a minor series of raids and ambushes initiated by the <a href="Paiute" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paiute</a> Indian tribe in Nevada, which resulted in the disruption of mail services of the Pony Express. It took place from May through June 1860, though sporadic violence continued for a period afterward. In the brief history that the Pony Express operated only once did the mail not go through. After completing eight weekly trips from both Sacramento and Saint Joseph, the Pony Express was forced to suspend mail services because of the outbreak of the <a href="Paiute" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paiute</a> Indian War in May 1860.</p>
<p>Approximately 6,000 Paiutes in Nevada had suffered during a winter of fierce blizzards that year. By spring, the whole tribe was ready to embark on a war, except for the Paiute chief named <a href="Numaga" class="uri" title="wikilink">Numaga</a>. For three days Numaga fasted and argued for peace. Meanwhile a raiding party attacked a Pony Express station called Williams Station, on the <a href="Carson_River" title="wikilink">Carson River</a> near present-day <a href="Lake_Lahontan" title="wikilink">Lake Lahontan</a>. One account says the raid was a deliberate attempt to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out when they went to investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five Americans, and the station was burned down.</p>
<p>During the following weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in Paiute country were ambushed and killed. The Pony Express was a special target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; some 16 employees were killed and approximately 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. The Paiute war cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 in livestock and station equipment, not to mention the loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. government troops, after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>During this brief war, one Pony Express mailing, which left San Francisco on July 21, 1860 did not immediately reach its destination; the mail pouch (Mochila) did not reach St. Joseph and then New York until almost two years later.</p>
<h2 id="famous-riders">Famous riders</h2>
<p>Back in 1860, riding for the Pony Express was difficult work &lt;U+2013&gt; riders had to be tough and lightweight. There is a famous advertisement that reportedly read, &quot;Wanted: Young, skinny, wiry fellows not over eighteen. Must be expert riders, willing to risk death daily. Orphans preferred.&quot;</p>
<p>The Pony Express had an estimated 80 riders that were in use at any one given time. In addition, there were also about 400 other employees including station keepers, stock tenders and route superintendents. Many young men applied for jobs with the Pony Express, all eager to face the dangers and the challenges that sometimes lay along the delivery route. Waddle and Majors could have easily hired them at a much lesser rate but instead paid them a handsome sum for that day of one hundred dollars a month. Famous American author <a href="Mark_Twain" title="wikilink">Mark Twain</a>, who saw the Pony Express in action first hand, described the riders in his travel memoir <em><a href="Roughing_It" title="wikilink">Roughing It</a></em> as: &quot;... usually a little bit of a man&quot;. Though the riders were small, lightweight, generally teenage boys, their untarnished record proved them to be heroes of the American West for the much needed and dangerous service they provided for the nation.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>A list of riders has been compiled by the staff of the St. Joseph Museum from various sources, including accounts from people who knew riders, relatives of riders and newspapers. Some of the riders' names are listed in reference.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> </p>

They covered at an average speed of , including all stops.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Before the mail pouch was delivered to the first rider on April 3, 1860, time was taken out for ceremonies and several speeches. First, Mayor M. Jeff Thompson gave a brief speech on the significance of the event for St. Joseph. Then William H. Russell and Alexander Majors addressed the gala crowd about how the Pony Express was just a &quot;precursor&quot; to the construction of a transcontinental railroad. At the conclusion of all the speeches, approximately 7:15 p.m., Russell turned the mail pouch over to the first rider. A cannon fired, the large assembled crowd cheered, and the rider dashed to the landing at the &quot;foot of Jules Street where the ferry boat Denver, alerted by the signal cannon, waited to carry the horse and rider across the Missouri River to Elwood, Kansas Territory.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> On April 9 at 6:45 p.m., the first rider from the east reached Salt Lake City, Utah. Then, on April 12, the mail pouch reached Carson City, Nevada at 2:30 p.m. The riders raced over the Sierra Nevada Mountains, through Placerville, California and on to Sacramento. Around midnight on April 14, 1860, the first mail pouch was delivered via the Pony Express to San Francisco.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>James Randall is credited as <em>the first eastbound rider</em> from the San Francisco Alta telegraph office since he was on the steamship <a href=":File:Steamer_antelope.jpg" title="wikilink"><em>Antelope</em></a> to go to Sacramento.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Mail for the Pony Express left San Francisco at 4:00 pm, carried by horse and rider to the waterfront, and then on by steamboat to Sacramento where it was picked up by the Pony Express rider. At 2:45 a.m., William (Sam) Hamilton was the first Pony Express rider to begin the journey from Sacramento. He rode all the way to Sportsman Hall Station where he gave his mochila filled with mail to Warren Upson. A California Registered Historical Landmark plaque at the site reads:</p>

<h3 id="william-cody">William Cody</h3>
<p><img src="Buffalo_Bill_Cody_ca1875.jpg" title="fig:William Cody, aka Buffalo Bill" alt="William Cody, aka Buffalo Bill" /> Probably more than any other rider in the Pony Express, William Cody (better known as <a href="Buffalo_Bill" title="wikilink">Buffalo Bill</a>) epitomizes the legend and the folk lore of the Pony Express. Numerous stories have been told of young Cody's adventures as a Pony Express rider. At the age of 15 Cody was on his way west to California when he met up with Pony Express agents along the way and signed on with the company. Cody helped in the construction of several way-stations. Thereafter, he was employed as a rider and was given a short 45-mile delivery run from the township of Julesburg which lay to the west. After some months he was transferred to Slade's Division in Wyoming where he made the longest non-stop ride from Red Buttes Station to Rocky Ridge Station and back when he found that his relief rider had been killed. The distance of 322 miles over one of the most dangerous sections of the entire trail was completed in 21 hours and 40 minutes. It took a total of 21 horses to complete this run.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Cody was present for every significant chapter in young western history, including the gold rush, the building of the railroads, and cattle herding on the Great Plains&lt;U+2014&gt;and found himself playing a part in nearly every one of these crucial stages of development. A career as a scout during the Civil War earned him his nickname and established his notoriety as a model frontiersman.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="robert-haslam">Robert Haslam</h3>
<p><img src="Haslam.gif" title="fig:&quot;Pony Bob&quot; Haslam in later years" alt="&quot;Pony Bob&quot; Haslam in later years" /> <a href="Robert_Haslam_(Pony_Bob)" title="wikilink">Robert Haslam (Pony Bob)</a> was among the most brave, resourceful, and best known riders of the Pony Express. He was born January 1840 in London, England, and came to U.S. as a teen. Haslam was hired by Bolivar Roberts, helped build the stations, and was given the mail run from Friday's Station at Lake Tahoe to Buckland&lt;U+2019&gt;s Station near Fort Churchill which was  to the east. Perhaps his greatest ride,  in 8 hours and 20 minutes while wounded, was an important contribution to the fastest trip ever made by the Pony Express. The message carried Lincoln's inaugural address. Pony Bob Haslam's ride was the result of the Indian problems in 1860. He had received the eastbound mail (probably the May 10 mail from San Francisco) at Friday's Station. At Buckland's Station his relief rider was so badly frightened over the Indian threat that he refused to take the mail. Haslam agreed to take the mail all the way to Smith's Creek for a total distance of  without a rest. After a rest of nine hours, he retraced his route with the westbound mail. At Cold Springs he found that Indians had raided the place, killing the station keeper and running off all of the stock. Finally he reached Buckland's Station, making the  round trip the longest on record.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> On the ride he was shot through the jaw with an Indian arrow, losing three teeth.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Pony Bob continued to work as a rider for Wells Fargo and Company after the Civil War, scouted for the U.S. Army well into his fifties, and even later accompanied his good friend Buffalo Bill Cody on a diplomatic mission to negotiate the surrender of Chief Sitting Bull in December 1890. He drifted in and out of public mention but eventually passed away in Chicago during the winter of 1912 (age 72) in deep poverty after suffering a stroke. Buffalo Bill paid for his friend's headstone at Mount Greewood Cemetery (111 Street and Sacramento) on Chicago's far south side.</p>
<h3 id="jack-keetley">Jack Keetley</h3>
<p><img src="Jkeetley.jpg" title="fig:Jack Keetley" alt="Jack Keetley" /> Jack Keetley was hired by A. E. Lewis for his Division at the age of nineteen, and put on the run from Marysville to Big Sandy. He was one of those who rode for the Pony Express during the entire nineteen months of its existence.</p>
<p>Jack Keetley's longest ride, upon which he doubled back for another rider, ended at Seneca where he was taken from the saddle sound asleep. He had ridden 340 miles in thirty-one hours without stopping to rest or eat.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> After the Pony Express was disbanded, Keetley went to Salt Lake City where he engaged in mining.</p>

<h3 id="billy-tate">Billy Tate</h3>
<p>Billy Tate was a 14 year old Pony Express rider who rode the express trail in Nevada near Ruby Valley. During the Paiute uprising of 1860 he was chased by a band of Paiute Indians on horseback and was forced to retreat into the hills behind some rocks where he killed seven of his assailants in a shoot-out before being killed himself. His body was found riddled with arrows but was not scalped, a sign that the Paiutes honored their enemy.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>An estimated 400 horses in total were used by the Pony Express to deliver the mail. Horses were selected for swiftness and endurance. On the east end of Pony Express route the horses were usually selected from <a href="U.S._Cavalry" title="wikilink">U.S. Cavalry</a> units. At the west end of the pony Express route in California, W.W. Finney purchased 100 head of short coupled stock called &quot;California Horses&quot;' while A.B. Miller purchased another 200 native ponies in and around the Great Salt Lake Valley. The horses were ridden quickly between stations, an average distance of 15 miles, and then were relieved and a fresh horse would be exchanged for the one that just arrived from its strenuous run.</p>
<p>During his route of , a Pony Express rider would change horses 8 to 10 times. The horses were ridden at a fast trot, canter or gallop, around  and at times they were driven to full gallop at speeds up to . Horses of the Pony Express were purchased in Missouri, Iowa, California, and some western U.S. territories.</p>
<p>The various types of horse ridden by riders of the Pony Express included Morgans and thoroughbreds which were often used on the eastern end of the trail. Pintos were often used in the middle section and mustangs were often used on the western (more rugged) end of the mail route. <a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="saddle">Saddle</h2>
<p><img src="Mochilla.jpg" title="fig:The Mochila &lt;U+2013&gt; Detail from Pony Express stations map by William Henry Jackson" alt="The Mochila &lt;U+2013&gt; Detail from Pony Express stations map by William Henry Jackson" /> In 1844, years before the Pony Express came to <a href="St._Joseph,_Missouri" title="wikilink">St. Joseph</a>, Israel Landis opened a small saddle and harness shop there. His business expanded as the town grew, and when the Pony Express came to town Landis was the ideal candidate to produce saddles for the new found Pony Express. Because Pony Express riders rode their horses at a quick pace over a distance of ten and more miles between stations, every consideration was made to reduce the overall weight the horse had to carry. To help reduce this load, special light weight <a href="saddle" title="wikilink">saddles</a> were designed and crafted. Using less leather and fewer metallic and wood components they fashioned a saddle that was similar in design to the regular stock saddle generally in use in the West at that time.</p>
<p>The mail pouch was a separate component to the saddle that made the Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was time consuming detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a <em>Mochila</em>, or covering of leather, was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.</p>
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>Although the Pony Express proved that the central/northern mail route was viable, <a href="Russell,_Majors_and_Waddell" title="wikilink">Russell, Majors and Waddell</a> did not get the contract to deliver mail over the route. The contract was instead awarded to <a href="Jeremy_Dehut" title="wikilink">Jeremy Dehut</a> in March 1861, who had taken over the southern Congressionally favored <a href="Butterfield_Overland_Mail" title="wikilink">Butterfield Overland Mail</a> Stage Line. Holladay took over the Russell, Majors and Waddell stations for his stagecoaches.</p>
<p>Shortly after the contract was awarded, the start of the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a> caused the stage line to cease operation. From March 1861, the Pony Express ran mail only between Salt Lake City and Sacramento. The Pony Express announced its closure on October 26, 1861, two days after the <a href="First_Transcontinental_Telegraph" title="wikilink">transcontinental telegraph</a> reached Salt Lake City and connected <a href="Omaha,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Omaha, Nebraska</a> and <a href="Sacramento,_California" title="wikilink">Sacramento, California</a>.

Envelope also has an issue of 1855, Washington-10c postage affixed to it." /> The foundation of accountable Pony Express history rests in the few tangible areas where records, papers, letters and mailings have yielded the most historical evidence. Up until the 1950s most of what was known about the short-lived Pony Express was the product of a few accounts, hearsay and folklore, generally true in their overall aspects, but lacking in verification in many areas for those who wanted to explore the history surrounding the founders, the various riders and station keepers or who were interested in stations or Forts along the Pony Express route itself.</p>
<p>The most complete books on the Pony Express are <em>The Story of the Pony Express</em> and <em>Saddles and Spurs</em> by Raymond &amp; Mary Settle and Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique as he was the first writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the middle 1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes the writer's background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well researched account he indeed had a good volume of footnotes, citations all prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate but more simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development as he put much time and effort into the annotations. Yet the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account on the history of the Pony Express amongst many historians.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
