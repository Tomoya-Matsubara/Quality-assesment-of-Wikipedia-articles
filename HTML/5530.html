<p>The <strong>Irish Republican Liberation Army</strong> (IRLA) is the most new incarnation of the various Irish <a href="paramilitary" class="uri" title="wikilink">paramilitary</a> organisations with aims to bring about a thirty-two county <a href="United_Ireland" title="wikilink">United Ireland</a>. Although much of its origins are as of yet unknown, the IRLA was brought attention to itself with its threats of action.</p>
<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
<p>The IRLA is centred around West <a href="Belfast" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belfast</a> in the <a href="Ardoyne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ardoyne</a> area.</p>
<h2 id="threats">Threats</h2>
<p>In November 2007, the IRLA threatened <a href="Sinn_Fein" title="wikilink">Sinn Fein</a> members who were involved in District Policing Partnerships. Further to these threats the IRLA were also involved in criminal activity according to the <a href="Independent_Monitoring_Commission" title="wikilink">Independent Monitoring Commission</a>. The IMC also said the IRLA has a small arms collection, though it's threat is not &quot;terrorist in nature.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>According to the <a href="Hansard" title="wikilink">Hansards</a>, on <a href="March_5" title="wikilink">March 5</a>, <a href="2008" class="uri" title="wikilink">2008</a>, <a href="Sammy_Wilson" title="wikilink">Sammy Wilson</a> asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland <a href="McNulty" class="uri" title="wikilink">McNulty</a> if would consider prohibiting the Irish Republican Liberation Army under the Terrorism Act 2000. McNulty gave a vague response that &quot;As a matter of normal policy and practice we do not comment on organisations not on the proscribed list.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
