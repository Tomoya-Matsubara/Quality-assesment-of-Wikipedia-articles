<p>The lands of the <a href="Mississippi_River" title="wikilink">Mississippi River Basin</a> were inhabited by <a href="Paleo-Indians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paleo-Indians</a> and later <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native American</a> tribes of the <a href="Mississippian_culture" title="wikilink">Mississippian culture</a> for thousands of years. The <a href="Chickasaw" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chickasaw</a> <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Indian tribe</a> populated the Mississippi River valley when <a href="Europe" title="wikilink">European</a> explorers first arrived on the <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North American continent</a>. In 1541, <a href="Spanish_people" title="wikilink">Spanish</a> <a href="Exploration" title="wikilink">explorer</a> <a href="Hernando_de_Soto" title="wikilink">Hernando de Soto</a> crossed the Mississippi River at or near Randolph. <a href="French_people" title="wikilink">French</a> explorer <a href="Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;-Robert_Cavelier,_Sieur_de_La_Salle" title="wikilink">Cavelier de La Salle</a> built the first French fortification at or near Randolph on his 1682 canoe expedition of the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>European <a href="settler" title="wikilink">settlers</a> arrived in the area around 1800. The town of Randolph was founded in the 1820s as one of the earliest European settlements in Tipton County. The location of Randolph, on the second <a href="Chickasaw_Bluff" title="wikilink">Chickasaw Bluff</a> along the banks of the <a href="Mississippi_River" title="wikilink">Mississippi River</a>, just south of the lower mouth of the <a href="Hatchie_River" title="wikilink">Hatchie River</a>, provided for an ideal harbor for <a href="flatboat" title="wikilink">flatboats</a> and <a href="steamboat" title="wikilink">steamboats</a> and made the town an early center of river commerce in <a href="West_Tennessee" title="wikilink">West Tennessee</a>. Randolph shipped more <a href="cotton" class="uri" title="wikilink">cotton</a> annually than <a href="Memphis,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Memphis</a> until 1840. The commercial success of the community also depended on the use of <a href="Slavery" title="wikilink">slave</a> labor in the cotton fields surrounding the settlement. In 1827, the Randolph <a href="Post_office" title="wikilink">Post office</a> was established and in 1834, the first <a href="pastor" class="uri" title="wikilink">pastor</a> was appointed at Randolph.</p>
<p>The fortunes of the community began to decline in the late 1840s due to failed <a href="Rail_transport" title="wikilink">railroad</a> development, an unfavorable mail route and an unsuccessful attempt to move the <a href="county_seat" title="wikilink">county seat</a> from <a href="Covington,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Covington</a> to Randolph. An unfinished project to cut a <a href="canal" class="uri" title="wikilink">canal</a> from the <a href="Hatchie_River" title="wikilink">Hatchie River</a> to the <a href="Tennessee_River" title="wikilink">Tennessee River</a> and other factors also contributed to the commercial demise of the town. The first <a href="Confederate_States_Army" title="wikilink">Confederate States Army</a> <a href="Fortification" title="wikilink">fort</a> in Tennessee was built at Randolph early in the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a> in 1861, a second fortification at Randolph was constructed later that same year. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice by <a href="Union_Army" title="wikilink">Union Army</a> forces, which further promoted the decline of the once flourishing community.</p>
<p>In 2008, <em>Randolph Bluff Historic Park</em> was dedicated. The park is intended to promote the Civil War history of the community and make the unique views of the Mississippi River available to a wider public. Once finished, the park will be part of the Mississippi River Corridor Tennessee, a project to &quot;create a scenic byway that connects historic sites along the Mississippi River&quot;. As of 2008, Randolph has a population of ca. 200 and consists of about two dozen dwellings. The economy of the rural community is dominated by <a href="agriculture" class="uri" title="wikilink">agriculture</a> with no major industries and businesses present.</p>

<h2 id="european-settlement">European settlement</h2>
<p>Around 1800, <a href="European_ethnic_groups" title="wikilink">Europeans</a> began settling the land east of the <a href="Mississippi_River" title="wikilink">Mississippi River</a> that was inhabited by the <a href="Chickasaw" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chickasaw</a> Indians for centuries prior to the arrival of Europeans. Chickasaw land in <a href="West_Tennessee" title="wikilink">West Tennessee</a> and southwestern <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a> was ceded in the <a href="Jackson_Purchase_(U.S._historical_region)" title="wikilink">Jackson Purchase</a> after negotiations in which the United States was represented by General <a href="Andrew_Jackson" title="wikilink">Andrew Jackson</a> and Governor <a href="Isaac_Shelby" title="wikilink">Isaac Shelby</a>, while the Chickasaw were represented by their chiefs and warriors.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In 1818, both sides agreed to the transfer by signing the Treaty of Tuscaloosa.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In the treaty, the United States agreed to pay the Chickasaw $300,000 in return for the right to the land east of the Mississippi River and north of the <a href="Mississippi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mississippi</a> state line.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Small_flatboat.JPG" title="fig:Small flatboat" alt="Small flatboat" /> Early European landowners were eager to secure their investment in land in southwest Tennessee. Years before Randolph would be founded, wealthy and influential investors tried to find ways to get a return on their share of land. In 1818, Judge <a href="John_Overton_(judge)" title="wikilink">John Overton</a> wrote to General <a href="James_Winchester" title="wikilink">James Winchester</a> that &quot;We must not let the owners of the property on the Bluffs at the Mississippi above us be beforehand in laying off town—as it might damp the sale of ours&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Overton and Winchester founded <a href="Memphis,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Memphis, Tennessee</a> along with <a href="Andrew_Jackson" title="wikilink">Andrew Jackson</a> in 1819.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Overton, Winchester and Jackson were trying to secure investments in property in the Memphis area that they owned and not give the advantage to investors &quot;above&quot;, north of Memphis on the Mississippi River, in Randolph.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Andrew Jackson (1767–1845) would become the 7th <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President of the United States</a> in 1829.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Both Memphis and Randolph are located on one of the four <a href="Chickasaw_Bluff" title="wikilink">Chickasaw Bluffs</a>, Randolph on the second and Memphis on the fourth. In the early 1800s, the terrain of the Chickasaw Bluffs provided promising locations for a harbor on the Mississippi River for both emerging towns. In 1820, the area that would become Randolph had an estimated population of 54.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Steamboat_Enterprise_1815_cropped.jpg" title="fig:Mississippi River steamboat" alt="Mississippi River steamboat" /> Early in the 1820s, landowners and investors John T.

Only  north of <a href="Memphis,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Memphis</a> by water, they described the area as &quot;a good landing for Mississippi River flatboats&quot;. The <a href="Hatchie_River" title="wikilink">Hatchie River</a>, joining the Mississippi River just north of the second Chickasaw Bluff, was accessible to <a href="Steamboats_of_the_Mississippi" title="wikilink">steamboats</a> for  upriver to <a href="Bolivar,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Bolivar</a>, in <a href="Hardeman_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Hardeman County</a>.

Randolph became the center of <a href="Steamboats_of_the_Mississippi" title="wikilink">steamboat</a> commerce in Tennessee and an important <a href="cotton" class="uri" title="wikilink">cotton</a> shipping point in the 1830s.

More cotton was shipped from Randolph than from Memphis until 1840.

<p>In the 1830s, two newspapers were published in Randolph, the <em>Randolph Recorder</em> and the <em>Randolph Whig</em>. The <em>Randolph Recorder</em> was founded in 1834 by F. S.

<p>&quot;Some time in the thirties&quot; of the 19th century, the first bank was founded in Randolph. A <a href="stagecoach" class="uri" title="wikilink">stagecoach</a> line, established in 1833 by James Brown, provided a connection between Randolph and <a href="Jackson,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Jackson</a> in <a href="Madison_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Madison County</a>, located  east of Randolph.

<h3 id="slavery">Slavery</h3>
<p>A good part of the commercial success of Randolph can be attributed to the use of slaves working the cotton fields of the area for their owners. <a href="Slavery" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slavery</a> was common in the <a href="Southern_States" title="wikilink">Southern States</a> in the time before and during the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a>. Landowners who ran <a href="plantation" title="wikilink">plantations</a> on their lands, bought slaves to work their fields, mostly for the <a href="Tillage" title="wikilink">cultivation</a> of <a href="cotton" class="uri" title="wikilink">cotton</a>. <a href="maize" title="wikilink">Corn</a>, <a href="bean" title="wikilink">beans</a> and <a href="pea" title="wikilink">peas</a> were also cultivated.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> In the <em>Randolph Recorder</em> during the early 1830s, landowners announced public auctions of slaves they owned. For the capture and return of runaway slaves, plantation owners offered <a href="Monetary_policy" title="wikilink">monetary</a> incentives between $10 and $100. Rewards up to $300 were offered for the return of a stolen slave if the thief of the slave could be convicted of the theft. The <a href="Tipton_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Tipton County</a> jail also published &quot;jailer's notices&quot; in the Randolph Recorder to inform owners of a slave of their <a href="incarceration" class="uri" title="wikilink">incarceration</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="decline">Decline</h3>

<p>The fortunes of Randolph declined in the later 1840s and the 1850s due to many factors, starting shortly after the establishment of the town.

Major General Sherman ordered <a href="Colonel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colonel</a> Charles C. Walcutt of the 46th Ohio Volunteer Infantry to Randolph.
