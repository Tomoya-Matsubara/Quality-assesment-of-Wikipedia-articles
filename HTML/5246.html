<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<h3 id="early-life">Early life</h3>
<p>A native of <a href="Harlem,_New_York" title="wikilink">Harlem, New York</a>, Whitfield spent most of his teen years in local <a href="billiards" title="wikilink">pool</a> halls. In his late teens, he and his family moved to <a href="Detroit,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Detroit, Michigan</a> so that his father could join his sister and work in her husband's chain of drug stores, Barthwell Drugs.</p>
<h3 id="early-career-with-motown">Early career with Motown</h3>
<p>At 19, Whitfield began hanging around at Motown's <a href="Hitsville_U.S.A." title="wikilink">Hitsville U.S.A.</a> offices, trying to get a chance at working for the growing label. Gordy recognized Whitfield's persistence and hired him in the quality control department that determined which songs would or would not be released by the label. Whitfield eventually joined Motown's in-house songwriting staff. Whitfield had a few successes including co-composing <a href="Marvin_Gaye" title="wikilink">Marvin Gaye</a>'s early hits including &quot;<a href="Pride_&amp;_Joy" title="wikilink">Pride &amp; Joy</a>&quot;, <a href="The_Marvelettes" title="wikilink">The Marvelettes</a>' &quot;<a href="Too_Many_Fish_in_the_Sea" title="wikilink">Too Many Fish in the Sea</a>&quot; and <a href="The_Velvelettes" title="wikilink">The Velvelettes</a>' &quot;<a href="Needle_in_a_Haystack" title="wikilink">Needle in a Haystack</a>&quot;, but he found his place at Motown when he began producing the recordings of his songs. His big break came when he took over <a href="Smokey_Robinson" title="wikilink">Smokey Robinson</a>'s role as the main producer for <a href="The_Temptations" title="wikilink">The Temptations</a> in 1966, after his &quot;<a href="Ain&#39;t_Too_Proud_to_Beg" title="wikilink">Ain't Too Proud to Beg</a>&quot; performed better than Robinson's &quot;<a href="Get_Ready_(1966_song)" title="wikilink">Get Ready</a>&quot; on the pop charts.</p>
<p>From 1966 until 1974, Whitfield produced virtually all of the material for The Temptations, experimenting with <a href="sound_effects" title="wikilink">sound effects</a> and other production techniques on the earliest of his records for them.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He found a songwriting collaborator in lyricist <a href="Barrett_Strong" title="wikilink">Barrett Strong</a>, the performer on Motown's first hit record, &quot;<a href="Money_(That&#39;s_What_I_Want)" title="wikilink">Money (That's What I Want)</a>&quot;, and wrote material for the Tempts and for other Motown artists such as <a href="Marvin_Gaye" title="wikilink">Marvin Gaye</a> and <a href="Gladys_Knight_&amp;_the_Pips" title="wikilink">Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips</a>, both of whom recorded Whitfield-produced hit versions of the Whitfield/Strong composition &quot;<a href="I_Heard_It_Through_the_Grapevine" title="wikilink">I Heard It Through the Grapevine</a>.&quot; The Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips version was the best-selling Motown single ever to that point, but it was replaced a year later by Marvin Gaye's version.</p>
<p>After Temptations lead singer <a href="David_Ruffin" title="wikilink">David Ruffin</a> was replaced with <a href="Dennis_Edwards" title="wikilink">Dennis Edwards</a> in 1968, Whitfield moved the group into a harder, darker sound that featured a blend of <a href="psychedelic" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychedelic</a> <a href="rock_and_roll" title="wikilink">rock</a> and <a href="funk" class="uri" title="wikilink">funk</a> heavily inspired by the work of <a href="Sly_&amp;_the_Family_Stone" title="wikilink">Sly &amp; the Family Stone</a> and <a href="Funkadelic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Funkadelic</a>, and also began changing the subject matter of the songs, moving away from the trademark poetic romance to the social issues of the time, such as war, poverty, politics, etc. The first Temptations single to feature this new &quot;<a href="psychedelic_soul" title="wikilink">psychedelic soul</a>&quot; style was &quot;<a href="Cloud_Nine_(song)" title="wikilink">Cloud Nine</a>&quot; in late 1968, which earned Motown its first <a href="Grammy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grammy</a> award (for <a href="Grammy_Award_for_Best_R&amp;B_Performance_by_a_Duo_or_Group_with_Vocals" title="wikilink">Best Rhythm &amp; Blues Performance by a Duo or Group</a>). A second Best R&amp;B Group Performance Grammy for Whitfield and the Tempts came in 1973 with &quot;<a href="Papa_Was_a_Rollin&#39;_Stone" title="wikilink">Papa Was a Rollin' Stone</a>.&quot; The instrumental B-side to &quot;Papa Was a Rollin' Stone&quot; earned Whitfield a Grammy with arranger Paul Riser for <a href="Grammy_Award_for_Best_R&amp;B_Instrumental_Performance" title="wikilink">Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance</a>, and Whitfield and Barrett Strong shared the songwriters' award for <a href="Grammy_Award_for_Best_R&amp;B_Song" title="wikilink">Best R&amp;B Song</a>.</p>
<p>The psychedelic soul records Whitfield produced for the Temptations and other artists such as <a href="Edwin_Starr" title="wikilink">Edwin Starr</a> and <a href="The_Undisputed_Truth" title="wikilink">The Undisputed Truth</a> experimented with and updated the Motown sound for the late-1960s.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Longer song durations, distorted guitars, multitracked drums, and unusual vocal arrangements became trademarks of Whitfield's productions, and later of records produced by Motown staffers he coached, including <a href="Frank_Wilson_(musician)" title="wikilink">Frank Wilson</a>. But friction and antagonism continued to grow between Whitfield and the Temptations during this time because the group disliked how Whitfield put more emphasis on instrumentation instead of their vocals and the group disliked that he would not write romantic ballads for them. However, by this time Whitfield was producing hit records for <a href="Edwin_Starr" title="wikilink">Edwin Starr</a>, the <a href="Undisputed_Truth" title="wikilink">Undisputed Truth</a> and <a href="Rare_Earth_(band)" title="wikilink">Rare Earth (band)</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1973, Whitfield left Motown to form his own record label, <a href="Whitfield_Records" title="wikilink">Whitfield Records</a>. In the beginning, his only act was The Undisputed Truth, which he had convinced to leave Motown. They never really had much more chart success, but Whitfield had a smash hit in 1976 with <a href="Rose_Royce" title="wikilink">Rose Royce</a>'s &quot;<a href="Car_Wash_(song)" title="wikilink">Car Wash</a>&quot;, issued on <a href="MCA_Records" title="wikilink">MCA Records</a>. Rose Royce (whose members were originally Starr's backing band while at Motown) went on to produce three more popular albums, but never could top the success of &quot;Car Wash,&quot; which served as the theme song to the 1976 <a href="motion_picture" title="wikilink">motion picture</a> <em><a href="Car_Wash_(film)" title="wikilink">Car Wash</a></em>. The <em>Car Wash</em> soundtrack won Whitfield a 1977 <a href="Grammy_Award_for_Best_Score_Soundtrack_Album_for_a_Motion_Picture,_Television_or_Other_Visual_Media" title="wikilink">Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In the early 1980s, Whitfield began working producing for Motown again, helming The Temptations' 1983 hit single &quot;Sail Away&quot; and the soundtrack to <em><a href="The_Last_Dragon" title="wikilink">The Last Dragon</a></em>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="January_18" title="wikilink">January 18</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, Whitfield pleaded guilty for failing to report royalty income he earned from 1995 to 1999 to the <a href="Internal_Revenue_Service" title="wikilink">Internal Revenue Service</a>. Facing charges of <a href="tax_evasion" title="wikilink">tax evasion</a> on over <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">$</a>2 million worth of income, he was sentenced to six months of house arrest and a $25,000 fine. The producer was not imprisoned because of health problems such as <a href="diabetes" class="uri" title="wikilink">diabetes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="death">Death</h3>
<p>During his last months alive, Whitfield stayed bedded at <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>' <a href="Cedars-Sinai_Medical_Center" title="wikilink">Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</a> where he underwent treatment for his bout with diabetes and other ailments. Within a few weeks before his death, Whitfield fell into a coma, which he eventually recovered from<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>. According to <a href="The_Undisputed_Truth" title="wikilink">The Undisputed Truth</a> leader Joe Harris, Whitfield died on September 16, 2008 at approximately 3:30 pm.</p>
