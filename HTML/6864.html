<p><strong>Colony collapse disorder</strong> (<strong>CCD</strong>) or sometimes <strong>honey bee depopulation syndrome</strong> (<strong>HBDS</strong>)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is a phenomenon in which worker bees from a <a href="Beehive_(beekeeping)" title="wikilink">beehive</a> or <a href="European_honey_bee" title="wikilink">European honey bee</a> colony abruptly disappear. While such disappearances have occurred throughout the history of <a href="Beekeeping" title="wikilink">apiculture</a>, the term <em>colony collapse disorder</em> was first applied to a drastic rise in the number of disappearances of Western honey bee colonies in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a> in late 2006.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Colony collapse is economically significant because <a href="List_of_crop_plants_pollinated_by_bees" title="wikilink">many agricultural crops</a> worldwide are <a href="Pollination" title="wikilink">pollinated</a> by bees.</p>
<p>European beekeepers observed similar phenomena in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and initial reports have also come in from Switzerland and <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a>, albeit to a lesser degree<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> while the <a href="Northern_Ireland_Assembly" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland Assembly</a> received reports of a decline greater than 50%.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Possible cases of CCD have also been reported in <a href="Taiwan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taiwan</a> since April 2007.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The cause or causes of the syndrome are not yet fully understood, although many authorities attribute the problem to <a href="biotic_component" title="wikilink">biotic</a> factors such as <em><a href="Varroa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Varroa</a></em> mites and insect diseases (i.e., <a href="Diseases_of_the_honey_bee" title="wikilink">pathogens</a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> including <em><a href="Nosema_apis" title="wikilink">Nosema apis</a></em> and <a href="Israel_acute_paralysis_virus" title="wikilink">Israel acute paralysis virus</a>).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Other proposed causes include environmental change-related stresses,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> <a href="malnutrition" class="uri" title="wikilink">malnutrition</a> and <a href="Pesticide_toxicity_to_bees" title="wikilink">pesticides</a> (<em>e.g.</em>. <a href="neonicotinoids" class="uri" title="wikilink">neonicotinoids</a> such as <a href="imidacloprid" class="uri" title="wikilink">imidacloprid</a>), and migratory beekeeping.

<p>Applying <a href="proteomics" class="uri" title="wikilink">proteomics</a>-based pathogen screening tools in 2010, researchers announced they had identified a co-infection of <a href="invertebrate_iridescent_virus" title="wikilink">invertebrate iridescent virus</a> type 6 (IIV-6) and <em><a href="Nosema_ceranae" title="wikilink">Nosema ceranae</a></em> in all CCD colonies sampled.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> These results, if confirmed, may finally offer an explanation for genuine cases of CCD. On the basis of this research, the <em><a href="New_York_Times" title="wikilink">New York Times</a></em> reported the colony collapse mystery solved, quoting researcher Dr. Bromenshenk, a co-author of the study, &quot;[The virus and fungus] are both present in all these collapsed colonies.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> </p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>From 1972 to 2006, there was a dramatic reduction in the number of <a href="feral" class="uri" title="wikilink">feral</a> honey bees in the U.S. (now almost absent)<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and a significant though somewhat gradual decline in the number of colonies maintained by beekeepers. This decline includes the cumulative losses from all factors, such as <a href="urbanization" class="uri" title="wikilink">urbanization</a>, pesticide use, <a href="Acarapis_woodi" title="wikilink">tracheal</a> and <em><a href="Varroa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Varroa</a></em> mites, and commercial <a href="beekeeper" title="wikilink">beekeepers</a>' retiring and going out of business. However, in late 2006 and early 2007 the rate of attrition was alleged to have reached new proportions, and the term &quot;colony collapse disorder&quot; was proposed to describe this sudden rash of disappearances.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Limited occurrences resembling CCD have been documented as early as 1869<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and this set of symptoms has in the past several decades been given many different names (<em>disappearing disease</em>, <em>spring dwindle</em>, <em>May disease</em>, <em>autumn collapse</em>, and <em>fall dwindle disease</em>).<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Most recently, a similar phenomenon in the winter of 2004/2005 occurred, and was attributed to <a href="Diseases_of_the_honey_bee#Varroa_mites" title="wikilink">Varroa mites</a> (the &quot;Vampire Mite&quot; scare), though this was never ultimately confirmed. Nobody has been able to determine the cause of any past appearances of this <a href="syndrome" class="uri" title="wikilink">syndrome</a>. Upon recognition that the syndrome does not seem to be seasonally restricted, and that it may not be a &quot;disease&quot; in the standard sense&lt;U+2014&gt;that there may not be a specific <a href="Disease_causative_agent" title="wikilink">causative agent</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;the syndrome was renamed.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="signs-and-symptoms">Signs and symptoms</h2>
<p>A colony which has collapsed from CCD is generally characterized by all of these conditions occurring simultaneously:<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Presence of <a href="Brood_(honey_bee)" title="wikilink">capped brood</a> in abandoned colonies. Bees normally will not abandon a hive until the capped brood have all hatched.</li>
<li>Presence of food stores, both <a href="honey" class="uri" title="wikilink">honey</a> and <a href="bee_pollen" title="wikilink">bee pollen</a>:
<ul>
<li>i. which are not immediately robbed by other bees</li>
<li>ii. which when attacked by <a href="Beehive" title="wikilink">hive</a> <a href="Pest_(organism)" title="wikilink">pests</a> such as <a href="Lesser_wax_moth" title="wikilink">wax moth</a> and <a href="small_hive_beetle" title="wikilink">small hive beetle</a>, the attack is noticeably delayed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Presence of the <a href="queen_bee" title="wikilink">queen bee</a>. If the queen is not present, the hive died because it was queenless, which is not considered CCD.</li>
</ul>
<p>Precursor symptoms that may arise before the final colony collapse are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insufficient <a href="Worker_bee" title="wikilink">workforce</a> to maintain the brood that is present</li>
<li>Workforce seems to be made up of young <a href="adult" class="uri" title="wikilink">adult</a> bees</li>
<li>The colony members are reluctant to consume provided feed, such as sugar syrup and <a href="Dietary_supplement" title="wikilink">protein supplement</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cause">Cause</h2>
<p>The exact mechanisms of CCD are still unknown. A primary focus of research is the possible association between the syndrome and the presence of the <a href="Israel_acute_paralysis_virus" title="wikilink">Israel acute paralysis virus</a> (IAPV).<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Identified by <a href="Hebrew_University_of_Jerusalem" title="wikilink">Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a> plant virologist <a href="Prof._Ilan_Sela" title="wikilink">Prof. Ilan Sela</a> in 2004, the virus causes honey bees to suffer from shivering wings followed by paralysis and death outside the hive. In 2007, the journal Science published research by a team of U.S. scientists and researchers that found a significant connection between IAPV and CCD in honey bees.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Other factors may also be involved, however, and several have been proposed as <a href="Disease_causative_agent" title="wikilink">causative agents</a>; malnutrition, <a href="Pesticide_toxicity_to_bees" title="wikilink">pesticides</a>, <a href="pathogen" title="wikilink">pathogens</a>, <a href="immunodeficiency" title="wikilink">immunodeficiencies</a>, <a href="mite" title="wikilink">mites</a>, <a href="fungus" class="uri" title="wikilink">fungus</a>, beekeeping practices (such as the use of <a href="antibiotics" class="uri" title="wikilink">antibiotics</a>, or long-distance transportation of beehives) and <a href="electromagnetic_radiation" title="wikilink">electromagnetic radiation</a>. Whether any single factor or a combination of factors (acting independently in different areas affected by CCD, or acting in tandem) is responsible is still unknown. It is likewise still uncertain whether CCD is a genuinely new phenomenon as opposed to a known phenomenon that previously only had a minor impact.</p>
<p>At present, the primary source of information, and the presumed &quot;lead&quot; group investigating the phenomenon, is the <a href="Colony_Collapse_Disorder_Working_Group" title="wikilink">Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group</a>, based primarily at <a href="Pennsylvania_State_University" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania State University</a>. Their preliminary report pointed out some patterns but drew no strong conclusions.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> A survey of beekeepers early in 2007 indicated that most hobbyist beekeepers believed that starvation was the leading cause of death in their colonies while commercial beekeepers overwhelmingly believed that invertebrate pests (<em>Varroa</em> mites, honey bee tracheal mites, and/or small hive beetles) were the leading cause of colony mortality.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> A scholarly review in June 2007 similarly addressed numerous theories and possible contributing factor, but left the issue unresolved.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>In July 2007, the <a href="United_States_Department_of_Agriculture" title="wikilink">United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) released its &quot;CCD Action Plan&quot;, which outlined a strategy for addressing CCD consisting of four main components:<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li>survey and data collection;</li>
<li>analysis of samples;</li>
<li>hypothesis-driven research; and</li>
<li>mitigation and preventative action.</li>
</ol>
<p>In July 2009, the first annual report of the U.S. Colony Collapse Disorder Steering Committee was published.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> It suggested that colony collapse may be caused by the interaction of many agents in combination.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Similarly, in 2009 the CCD Working Group published a comprehensive descriptive study that concluded: &quot;Of the 61 variables quantified (including adult bee physiology, pathogen loads, and pesticide levels), no single factor was found with enough consistency to suggest one causal agent. Bees in CCD colonies had higher pathogen loads and were co-infected with more pathogens than control populations, suggesting either greater pathogen exposure or reduced defenses in CCD bees.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> At present, therefore, research has not identified any one definitive causative factor despite having examined nearly all of those listed below.</p>
<h3 id="malnutrition">Malnutrition</h3>
<p>One of the patterns reported by the group at Pennsylvania State was that all producers in a preliminary survey noted a period of &quot;extraordinary stress&quot; affecting the colonies in question prior to their die-off, most commonly involving poor nutrition and/or drought.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> This is the only factor that <em>all</em> of the cases of CCD had in common in this report; accordingly, there is at least some significant possibility that the phenomenon is correlated to nutritional stress and may not manifest in healthy, well-nourished colonies. This is similar to the findings of a later independent survey in which small-scale beekeeping operations (up to 500 colonies) in several states reported their belief that malnutrition and/or weak colonies was the factor responsible for their bees dying in over 50% of the cases, whether the losses were believed to be due to CCD or not.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Some researchers have attributed the syndrome to the practice of feeding <a href="high-fructose_corn_syrup" title="wikilink">high-fructose corn syrup</a> (HFCS) to supplement winter stores. The variability of HFCS may be relevant to the apparent inconsistencies of results. European commentators have suggested a possible connection with HFCS produced from genetically modified corn.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> If this were the sole factor involved, however, this should also lead to the exclusive appearance of CCD in wintering colonies being fed HFCS, but many reports of CCD occur in other contexts with beekeepers who do not use HFCS.</p>
<p>Other researchers state that colony collapse disorder is mainly a problem of feeding the bees a <a href="monoculture" class="uri" title="wikilink">monoculture</a> diet when they should receive food from a variety of sources/plants. In winter the bees are given a single food source such as <a href="corn_syrup" title="wikilink">corn syrup</a> (high-fructose or other), sugar and pollen substitute. In summer they may only pollinate a single crop (e.g., almonds, cherries, or apples).<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>A study published in 2010 found that bees that were fed pollen from a variety of different plant species showed signs of having a healthier immune system than those eating pollen from a single species. Bees fed pollen from five species had higher levels of <a href="glucose_oxidase" title="wikilink">glucose oxidase</a> than bees fed pollen from one species, even if the pollen had a higher protein content. The authors hypothesised that CCD may be linked to a loss of plant diversity.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Similarly, other researchers in 2009 put forth the untested hypothesis &quot;that a honey bee dietary deficiency of pyrethrums and other micronutrients from <a href="Pyrethrum" title="wikilink"> pyrethrum producing plants</a> allows parasitic mites to either kill the honey bees directly or reduce honey bee resistance to other pathogens. Intermittent feeding of honey bees on pyrethrum producing plants might reverse or prevent colony collapse disorder&quot;;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> however, this does not address cases of CCD occurring in the absence of mite infestations.</p>
<h3 id="pathogens-and-immunodeficiency-theories">Pathogens and immunodeficiency theories</h3>

<h4 id="general">General</h4>
<p>Some researchers have commented that the pathway of propagation functions in the manner of a <a href="contagious_disease" title="wikilink">contagious disease</a>; however, there is some sentiment that the disorder may involve an <a href="Immunosuppression" title="wikilink">immunosuppressive</a> mechanism,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> potentially linked to the aforementioned &quot;stress&quot; leading to a weakened immune system. Specifically, according to researchers at Pennsylvania State: &quot;The magnitude of detected infectious agents in the adult bees suggests some type of immunosuppression&quot;. These researchers initially suggested a connection between <em><a href="Varroa_destructor" title="wikilink">Varroa destructor</a></em> mite infestation and CCD, suggesting that a combination of these bee mites, <a href="Deformed_Wing_Virus" title="wikilink">deformed wing virus</a> (which the mites transmit) and bacteria work together to suppress immunity and may be one cause of CCD.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> This research group is reported to be focusing on a search for possible viral, bacterial, or fungal pathogens which may be involved.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>When a colony is dying, for whatever cause, and there are other healthy colonies nearby (as is typical in a <a href="bee_yard" title="wikilink">bee yard</a>), those healthy colonies often enter the dying colony and rob its provisions for their own use. If the dying colony's provisions were contaminated (by natural or man-made toxins), the resulting pattern (of healthy colonies becoming sick when in proximity to a dying colony) might suggest to an observer that a contagious disease is involved. However, it is typical in CCD cases that provisions of dying colonies are not being robbed, suggesting that at least this particular mechanism (toxins being spread via robbing, thereby mimicking a disease) is <em>not</em> involved in CCD.</p>
<p>Additional evidence that CCD might be an infectious disease comes from the following observations: the hives of colonies that had died from CCD could be reused with a healthy colony only if they were first treated with DNA-destroying radiation,<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and the CCD Working Group report in 2010 indicated that CCD-exhibiting hives tended to occur in proximity to one another within apiaries.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p>According to a 2007 article, the <a href="mite" title="wikilink">mites</a> <em><a href="Varroa_destructor" title="wikilink">Varroa destructor</a></em> remain the world's most destructive honey bee killer due in part to the <a href="virus" title="wikilink">viruses</a> they carry, including <a href="deformed_wing_virus" title="wikilink">deformed wing virus</a> and <a href="acute_bee_paralysis_virus" title="wikilink">acute bee paralysis virus</a>, which have both been implicated in CCD.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Affliction with <em>Varroa</em> mites also tends to weaken the <a href="immune_system" title="wikilink">immune system</a> of the bees. Dr. Enesto Guzman, an entomological researcher at the <a href="University_of_Guelph" title="wikilink">University of Guelph</a> in Canada, studied 413 <a href="Ontario" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ontario</a> bee colonies in 2007-08. About 27% of hives did not survive the winter, and the <a href="Varroa_destructor" title="wikilink"><em>Varroa</em></a> mite was identified as the cause in 85% of the cases.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> As such, <em>Varroa</em> mites have been considered as a possible cause of CCD, though not all dying colonies contain these mites.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>In September 2007, results of a large-scale statistical <a href="RNA" class="uri" title="wikilink">RNA</a> <a href="sequencing" class="uri" title="wikilink">sequencing</a> study of afflicted and unafflicted colonies were reported. RNA from all organisms in a colony was sequenced and compared with sequence databases to detect the presence of pathogens. The study used technology from <a href="454_Life_Sciences" title="wikilink">454 Life Sciences</a> developed for human genome sequencing. All colonies were found to be infected with numerous pathogens, but only the <a href="Israel_acute_paralysis_virus" title="wikilink">Israel acute paralysis virus</a> (IAPV) showed a significant association with CCD: the virus was found in 25 of the 30 tested CCD colonies, and only in one of the 21 tested non-CCD colonies.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Scientists pointed out that this association was no proof of causation, and other factors may also be involved in the disease or the presence of IAPV may only be a marker signifying afflicted colonies and not the actual causative agent. To prove causation, experiments are planned to deliberately infect colonies with the virus.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>The IAPV was discovered in 2004, and belongs to the <a href="Dicistroviridae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dicistroviridae</a>. It causes paralysis in bees which then die outside the hive. It can be transmitted by the mite <em>Varroa destructor</em>. These mites, however, were found in only half of the CCD colonies.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>The virus was also found in samples of Australian honey bees. Australian honey bees have been imported into the U.S. since 2004,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> and until recently, it was thought possible that this is how the virus originally reached North America. Recent findings, however, reveal the virus has been present in American bees since 2002.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Recent research (2009) has found that an indicator for an impaired <a href="protein" class="uri" title="wikilink">protein</a> production is common among all bees affected by CCD, a pattern consistent with IAPV infection. It is conjectured that Dicistroviridae, like the IAPV, cause degradation of the <a href="ribosome" title="wikilink">ribosomes</a>, which are responsible for <a href="protein_synthesis" title="wikilink">protein production</a> of <a href="cell_(biology)" title="wikilink">cells</a>, and that this reduced ribosomal function weakens the bees, making them more vulnerable to factors that might not otherwise be lethal.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="nosema"><em>Nosema</em></h4>
<p>Some have suggested that the syndrome may be an inability by beekeepers to correctly identify known diseases such as <a href="Diseases_of_the_honey_bee#European_foulbrood_(EFB)" title="wikilink">European foulbrood</a> or the <a href="microsporidia" title="wikilink">microsporidian</a> fungus <em><a href="Nosema_apis" title="wikilink">Nosema</a></em>. The testing and diagnosis of samples from affected colonies (already performed) makes this highly unlikely, as the symptoms are fairly well-known and differ from what is classified as CCD. A high rate of <em>Nosema</em> infection was reported in samples of bees from Pennsylvania, but this pattern was not reported from samples elsewhere.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>Mariano Higes, a scientist heading a team at a government-funded apiculture centre in <a href="Guadalajara_(province)" title="wikilink">Guadalajara, Spain</a>, has reported that when hives of European honey bees were infected with <em><a href="Nosema_ceranae" title="wikilink">Nosema ceranae</a></em>, a microsporidian fungus, the colonies were wiped out within eight days.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Higes has extrapolated from this research to conclude that CCD is caused by <em>N. ceranae</em>. Higes and his team have worked on this problem since 2000, and claim to have ruled out many other potential causes.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> However, a 2009 comprehensive survey of CCD-affected bee populations in the United States suggested that CCD likely involves an interaction between pathogens and other stress factors.

<h3 id="viral-and-fungal-combination">Viral and fungal combination</h3>
<p>A University of Montana and Montana State University team of scientists headed by Jerry Bromenshenk and working with the US Army&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="Edgewood_Chemical_Biological_Center" title="wikilink">Edgewood Chemical Biological Center</a> published a paper in October, 2010 saying that a new <a href="DNA_virus" title="wikilink">DNA virus</a>, invertebrate iridescent virus or IIV6, and the fungus <em><a href="Nosema_ceranae" title="wikilink">Nosema ceranae</a></em> were found in every killed colony the group studied. In their study they found that neither agent alone seemed deadly, but a combination of the virus and <em>N. ceraneae</em> was always 100% fatal. Bromenshenk said it is not yet clear whether one condition weakens the bees enough to be finished off by the second, or whether they somehow compound the other&lt;U+2019&gt;s destructive power. &lt;U+201C&gt;They&lt;U+2019&gt;re co-factors, that&lt;U+2019&gt;s all we can say at the moment. They&lt;U+2019&gt;re both present in all these collapsed colonies.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a><a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>Previous research, though not all, had already identified the fungus as part of the problem, and several RNA-based viruses had been detected as well. But the Army/Montana team, using a new software system developed by the military for analyzing proteins, uncovered a new DNA-based virus, and established a linkage to <em>N. ceranae</em>. Once the virus and the fungus were identified, the researchers tested bees in the lab. First they infected the bees with the fungus alone, and some died, though not as many as with Colony Collapse Disorder. Then they infected some with just the virus, with the same result. When the combination of virus and fungus was used, the results apperaed similar to CDC. The researchers say that the next step to test their theory will be to inoculate a colony with the two pathoens to see if it causes a colony collapse. &lt;U+201C&gt;The real closure of the circle for us is to take the two pathogens to inoculate a colony, see it collapse, then pull out the pathogens again.&quot;<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>Whether this identified bee virus and its potential interaction with Nosema species is the cause or marker of CCD, is unknown. Also still not explained is the reason that the bees are never found dead in the hives but fly off at the time of death. Bromenshenk theorizes that the viral-fungal combination disrupts memory or navigating skills and the bees simply get lost. Another possibility, he said, is a kind of insect insanity. Scientists in the project emphasize that their conclusions are not the final word. They suggest that more research is still needed to determine, for example, how further outbreaks might be prevented, and how much environmental factors like heat, cold or drought might play a role. The study did not look into the role that pesticides may play, if any.</p>
<p>Information about the study was released to the public in a front page article in <em>The New York Times</em> with the heading &quot;Scientists and Soldiers Solve A Bee Mystery&quot;. A few days later an article was published in <em>Fortune Magazine</em> with the title, &quot;What a scientist didn't tell the New York Times about his study on bee deaths&quot;. Professor of entomology at Penn State University James Frazier, who is currently researching the sublethal impact of pesticides on bees, said that while Bromenshenk's study generated some useful data, Bromenshenk has a conflict of interest as CEO of a company developing scanners to diagnose bee diseases. &quot;He could benefit financially from that if this thing gets popularized,&quot; Frazier says, &quot;so it's a difficult situation to deal with.&quot; He adds that his own research has shown that pesticides affect bees &quot;absolutely, in multiple ways.&quot;<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="pesticides">Pesticides</h3>

<p>One of the more common general hypotheses concerns <a href="pesticide" title="wikilink">pesticides</a> (or, more specifically, <a href="insecticide" title="wikilink">insecticides</a>), though several studies have found no common <a href="environmental_factor" title="wikilink">environmental factors</a> between unrelated outbreaks studied.</p>
<p>It is particularly difficult to evaluate pesticide contributions to CCD for several reasons. First, the variety of pesticides in use in the different areas reporting CCD makes it difficult to test for all possible pesticides simultaneously. Second, many commercial <a href="beekeeping" class="uri" title="wikilink">beekeeping</a> operations are mobile, transporting hives over large geographic distances over the course of a season, potentially exposing the colonies to different pesticides at each location. Third, the bees themselves place <a href="pollen" class="uri" title="wikilink">pollen</a> and honey into long-term storage, effectively meaning that there may be a delay of anywhere from days to months before contaminated provisions are fed to the colony, negating any attempts to associate the appearance of symptoms with the actual time at which exposure to pesticides occurred. Pesticides used on bee forage are far more likely to enter the colony via the pollen stores rather than via nectar (because pollen is carried externally on the bees, while nectar is carried internally, and may kill the bee if too toxic), though not all potentially lethal chemicals, either natural or man-made, affect the adult bees: many primarily affect the brood, but brood die-off does not appear to be happening in CCD. Most significantly, brood are not fed honey, and adult bees consume relatively little pollen; accordingly, the pattern in CCD suggests that if contaminants or toxins from the environment <em>are</em> responsible, it is most likely to be via the honey, as it is the adults that are dying (or leaving), not the brood.</p>
<p>One recently published view is that bees are falling victim to new varieties of <a href="nicotine" class="uri" title="wikilink">nicotine</a>-based pesticides;<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> beekeepers in Canada are also losing their bees and are blaming <a href="neonicotinoid" class="uri" title="wikilink">neonicotinoid</a> pesticides. To date, most of the evaluation of possible roles of pesticides in CCD have relied on the use of surveys submitted by beekeepers, but it seems likely that direct testing of samples from affected colonies will be needed, especially given the possible role of <em>systemic</em> insecticides such as the neonicotinoid <a href="Imidacloprid_effects_on_bee_population" title="wikilink">imidacloprid</a> (which are applied to the soil and taken up into the plant's tissues, including pollen and <a href="nectar" class="uri" title="wikilink">nectar</a>), which may be applied to a crop when the beekeeper is not present. The known effects of imidacloprid on insects, including honey bees, are consistent with the symptoms of CCD;<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> for example, the effects of imidacloprid on <a href="termite" title="wikilink">termites</a> include apparent failure of the immune system, and disorientation.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> In Europe, the interaction of the phenomenon of &quot;dying bees&quot; with imidacloprid has been discussed for quite some time now.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> It was a study from the &quot;Comit&lt;U+00E9&gt; Scientifique et Technique (CST)&quot; which was in the center of discussion, which led to a partial ban of imidacloprid in France. The imidacloprid pesticide Gaucho was banned, in 1999 by the French Minister of Agriculture <a href="Jean_Glavany" title="wikilink">Jean Glavany</a>, primarily due to concern over potential effects on honey bees.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Consequently when <a href="fipronil" class="uri" title="wikilink">fipronil</a>, a phenylpyrazole insecticide and in Europe mainly labeled &quot;Regent&quot;, was used as a replacement, it was also found to be toxic to bees, and banned partially in France in 2004.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> In February 2007, about forty French deputies, led by <a href="Union_for_a_Popular_Movement" title="wikilink">UMP</a> member <a href="Jacques_Remiller" title="wikilink">Jacques Remiller</a>, requested the creation of a Parliamentary Investigation Commission on Overmortality of Bees, underlining that honey production was decreasing by 1,000 tons a year for a decade. , no investigations were yet opened.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Five other insecticides based on fipronil were also accused of killing bees. However, the scientific committees of the European Union are still of the opinion &quot;that the available monitoring studies were mainly performed in France and EU-member-states should consider the relevance of these studies for the circumstances in their country&quot;.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>Around the same time French beekeepers succeeded in banning neonicotinoids, the Clinton administration permitted pesticides which were previously banned,<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> including imidacloprid.

<p>In 2005, a team of scientists led by the National Institute of Beekeeping in Bologna, Italy, found pollen obtained from seeds dressed with imidacloprid contains significant levels of the insecticide, and suggested the polluted pollen might cause honey bee colony death.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Analysis of maize and sunflower crops originating from seeds dressed with imidacloprid suggest large amounts of the insecticide will be carried back to honey bee colonies.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in sucrose solution have also been documented to affect homing and foraging activity of honey bees.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Imidacloprid in sucrose solution fed to bees in the laboratory impaired their communication for a few hours.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in laboratory and <a href="field_experiment" title="wikilink">field experiment</a> decreased flight activity and olfactory discrimination, and olfactory learning performance was impaired.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>Researchers from <a href="Washington_State_University" title="wikilink">Washington State University</a>, in a 2010 online news article, stated: &quot;Prior research by scientists from <a href="Pennsylvania_State_University" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania State University</a> found unprecedentedly high levels of two pesticides in every sample of honeycomb or foundation wax tested, as well as lower levels of 70 other pesticides. The pesticides found in the highest concentrations were <a href="fluvalinate" class="uri" title="wikilink">fluvalinate</a> and <a href="coumaphos" class="uri" title="wikilink">coumaphos</a>, used to eradicate the bee pest <a href="varroa_mite" title="wikilink">varroa mites</a>, which have themselves been suggested as a cause&quot;. In this same article, Pennsylvania State researcher Maryann Frazier was quoted as stating &quot;We believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors, possibly including mites, viruses, and pesticides.&quot; The Washington State researchers suggested that the pathogen <em><a href="Nosema_ceranae" title="wikilink">Nosema ceranae</a></em> probably interacts with chemicals to contribute to colony collapse .</p>
<h4 id="fipronil">Fipronil</h4>

<p>Fipronil is another chemical sometimes blamed for the spread of colony collapse disorder among bees. It has been found by the Minutes-Association for Technical Coordination Fund in France that even at very low nonlethal doses for bees, the pesticide still impairs their ability to locate their hive, resulting in large numbers of forager bees lost with every pollen-finding expedition;<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> other studies, however, have shown no acute effect on honey bees.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>Fipronil is designed to eliminate insects similar to bees such as <em><a href="Vespula_germanica" title="wikilink">Vespula germanica</a></em> and many other colonial pests by a process of <em>toxic baiting</em>, whereby one insect returning to the hive spreads the pesticide among the brood.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="antibiotics-and-miticides">Antibiotics and miticides</h3>
<p>Most beekeepers affected by CCD report that they use <a href="antibiotic" title="wikilink">antibiotics</a> and <a href="Acaricide" title="wikilink">miticides</a> in their colonies, though the lack of uniformity as to which particular chemicals are used<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> makes it seem unlikely that any single such chemical is involved. However, it is possible that not all such chemicals in use have been tested for possible effects on honey bees, and could therefore potentially be contributing to the CCD phenomenon.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="genetically-modified-crops-gmo">Genetically modified crops (GMO)</h3>
<p>Some <a href="Genetically_modified_food" title="wikilink">genetically modified (GM) crops</a> produce the natural insecticide <a href="Bacillus_thuringiensis" title="wikilink">Bt toxin</a>, which was hypothesised to affect bees. In the scant literature on the topic, there exists no evidence of any negative effects on honey bee populations,<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> and while research on GM crops is still ongoing, new results continue to suggest GM crops have no negative effect on bee populations.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a><a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> Further, CCD cases are known in areas of Europe and Canada where Bt crops are not grown.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>Since U.S. beekeeper <a href="Nephi_Miller" title="wikilink">Nephi Miller</a> first began moving his hives to different areas of the country for the winter of 1908, migratory beekeeping has become widespread in America.</p>
<p>Bee rental for pollination is a crucial element of U.S. agriculture, which could not produce anywhere near its current levels with native pollinators alone.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> U.S. beekeepers collectively earn much more from renting their bees out for pollination than they do from honey production.</p>
<p>Researchers are concerned that trucking colonies around the country to pollinate crops, where they intermingle with other bees from all over, helps spread viruses and mites among colonies. Additionally, such continuous movement and re-settlement is considered by some a strain and disruption for the entire hive, possibly rendering it less resistant to all sorts of systemic disorder.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="u.s.-bee-rental-travel-extent">U.S. bee rental travel extent</h4>
<p>One major U.S. beekeeper reports moving his hives from Idaho to California in January, then to apple orchards in Washington in March, to North Dakota two months later, and then back to Idaho by November&lt;U+2014&gt;a journey of several thousand kilometres. Others move from Florida to New Hampshire or to Texas; nearly all visit California for the almond bloom in January.</p>
<p>Beekeepers in Europe and Asia are generally far less mobile, with bee populations moving and mingling within a smaller geographic extent (although some keepers do move longer distances, it is much less common).</p>
<p>This wider spread and intermingling in the U.S. has resulted in far greater losses from <em>Varroa</em> mite infections in recent years.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="climate-change">Climate change</h3>
<p>A few scientists have suggested that <a href="climate_change" title="wikilink">climate change</a> can make bee hives more vulnerable to CCD, although it is not implicated as a direct cause of the disorder. &quot;We see plants blooming at different times of the year&quot;, says amateur beekeeper Wayne Esaias, a researcher at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, &quot;and that's why the nectar flows are so much earlier now. I need to underscore that I have no evidence that <a href="global_warming" title="wikilink">global warming</a> is a key player in colony collapse disorder. But it might be a contributor, and changes like this might be upping the stress level of our bee populations&quot;.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="electromagnetic-radiation">Electromagnetic radiation</h3>
<p>Despite considerable discussion on the Internet and in the lay media, there have been almost no careful studies, published in peer reviewed scientific literature, on effects of electromagnetic field exposure on honey bees. One of the few peer-reviewed studies was published in 1981 by Gary and Westerdahl. This study was conducted as part of a research program to assess possible environmental impacts of solar power satellite systems, which would beam immense amounts of microwave energy from satellites to receiving stations on the ground to be converted into electrical power. The investigators measured flight, orientation, and memory functions in honey bees after thirty minutes' exposure to 2.45-GHz continuous-wave microwaves at power densities from 30 to 500 watts per square meter &lt;U+2014&gt; similar in frequency to that used by mobile phone networks but at far higher power densities than produced at nearly all locations from base station antennas except very close to the antennas. The investigators found &quot;no evidence that airborne invertebrates would be significantly affected during transient passage through microwaves associated with <a href="Space-based_solar_power" title="wikilink">solar power satellite</a> ground-based microwave receiving stations&quot;.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> This issue (of effect of microwave energy on honey bees) has reappeared in context of the present controversy about possible health risks of wireless communications systems. However, no studies have appeared that have an adequate experimental design and exposure assessment to allow reliable conclusions to be drawn.</p>
<p>In 2004 an exploratory study was conducted on the non-thermal effects of electromagnetic exposure and learning. The investigators did not find any change in behavior due to RF exposure from the DECT base station operating at 1880-1900 MHz.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2006 investigators at the <a href="University_of_Koblenz-Landau" title="wikilink">University of Landau</a> did a pilot study on the non-thermal effects of <a href="radio_frequency" title="wikilink">radio frequency</a> (&quot;RF&quot;) on honey bees (<em><a href="Carniolan_honey_bee" title="wikilink">Apis mellifera carnica</a></em>) and suggested that when bee hives have <a href="DECT" class="uri" title="wikilink">DECT</a> <a href="Cordless_telephone" title="wikilink">cordless phone</a> base stations embedded in them, the close-range <a href="electromagnetic_field" title="wikilink">electromagnetic field</a> (&quot;EMF&quot;) may reduce the ability of bees to return to their hive; they also noticed a slight reduction in honeycomb weight in treated colonies.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> In the course of their study, one half of their colonies broke down, including some of their controls which did not have DECT base stations embedded in them.</p>
<p>In April 2007, news of a study conducted by investigators at <a href="University_of_Koblenz-Landau" title="wikilink">University of Landau</a> appeared in various media outlets, beginning with an article in <em><a href="The_Independent" title="wikilink">The Independent</a></em>, which stated that the subject of the study included <a href="mobile_phone" title="wikilink">mobile phones</a> and had related them to CCD.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> Though <a href="Mobile_phone" title="wikilink">Cellular phones</a> were implicated by other media reports at the time, they were not covered in the 2007 study. Researchers involved with the 2007 study have since stated that their research did not include findings on cell phones, or their relationship to CCD, and indicated that the <em>Independent</em> article had misinterpreted their results and created &quot;a horror story&quot;. It should be noted however that the frequency range involved in the study, near 1900 MHz, is the more recent band employed by GSM mobile phones (the older band being much lower at 850 MHz) so the test results at the DECT handset's frequency could be correlated to the spread of GSM cellular and wireless handset use.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a><a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a><a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>
<p>In May 2010, two researchers from Chandigarh's Panjab University published a study alleging to find significant changes in honey bee behavior as a result of the placement of two functional cellphones of GSM 900 MHz frequency inside the hive.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> The study was immediately criticized for systemic errors, primarily based on the low sample size (four colonies). Criticisms also noted that the researchers mischaracterized the electromagnetic environment of areas where CCD has been reported and drew a false comparison to the electromagnetic environment of India.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>
<p>No mechanism has been established by which weak radiofrequency energy can affect the behavior of insects, apart from heating effects. However, it is well-established that honey bees can detect weak static or low-frequency magnetic fields, which they use as one of several cues in navigation.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="management">Management</h2>

<p><a href="Mid-Atlantic_Apiculture_Research_and_Extension_Consortium" title="wikilink">MAAREC</a> offered the following tentative recommendations for beekeepers noticing the symptoms of CCD:<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li>Do not combine collapsing colonies with strong colonies.</li>
<li>When a collapsed colony is found, store the equipment where you can use preventive measures to ensure that bees will not have access to it.</li>
<li>If you feed your bees sugar syrup, use <a href="Fumagillin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fumagillin</a>.</li>
<li>If you are experiencing colony collapse and see a secondary infection, such as <a href="Diseases_of_the_honey_bee#European_foulbrood_(EFB)" title="wikilink">European Foulbrood</a>, treat the colonies with <a href="Terramycin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Terramycin</a>, not <a href="Tylan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tylan</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another proposed remedy for farmers of pollinated crops is simply to switch from using beekeepers to the use of <a href="native_bee" title="wikilink">native bees</a>. Native bees can be helped to establish themselves by providing suitable nesting locations and some additional crops the bees could use to feed from (e.g. when the pollination season of the commercial crops on the farm has ended).<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a><a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
<p>In April 2009, it was reported that Russian bees that were resistant to the <a href="varroa_mite" title="wikilink">varroa mite</a> had been introduced into the U.S., and that this was helping to solve the problem.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> Similarly, a British beekeeper successfully developed another strain of bees that are resistant to varroa mites.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a><a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a><a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a><a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2009, a group of scientists that originally discovered the CCD-causing IAPV virus <a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> showed that the virus infection can be successfully eradicated by using the RNAi silencing technology.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> This approach is used by <a href="Beeologics" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beeologics</a>, a USA-Israeli biotechnology company that develops CCD-combating products.</p>
<h2 id="epidemiology">Epidemiology</h2>

<p>In the U.S., at least 24 different states<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a><a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> as well as portions of Canada<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> had reported at least one case of CCD in 2007. However, in many cases, beekeepers reporting significant losses of bees did not experience CCD, and a major part of the subsequent analysis of the phenomenon hinges upon distinguishing between true CCD losses and non-CCD losses.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> In a survey of 384 responding beekeepers from 13 states reporting the number of hives containing few or no bees in spring, 23.8% met the specified criterion for CCD (that 50% or more of their dead colonies were found without bees and/or with very few dead bees in the hive or apiary).<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> In the U.S., CCD-suffering operations had a total loss of 45% compared to the total loss of 25% of all colonies experienced by non-CCD suffering beekeepers in 2006-2007; it is further noted that non-CCD winter losses as high as 50% have occurred in some years and regions (e.g., 2000-2001 in <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a>), though normal winter losses are typically considered to be in the range of 15-25%.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
<p>There were also putative cases reported by the media from India, Brazil<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> and parts of Europe.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> Since the beginning of the 1990s, France, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Greece, Slovenia and the Netherlands have been affected by honey bee disappearances, though this is not necessarily associated with CCD;<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Austria and United Kingdom (where it has been dubbed the &quot;<a href="Mary_Celeste" title="wikilink">Mary Celeste</a>&quot; phenomenon (after a ship whose crew disappeared in 1872)<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> had also reportedly been affected.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> It is far from certain that all or any of these reported non-U.S. cases were indeed CCD: there was considerable publicity, but only rarely was the phenomenon described in sufficient detail. In Germany, for example, where some of the first reports of CCD in Europe appeared, and where, according to the German national association of beekeepers, 40% of the honey bee colonies died,<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> there was no scientific confirmation; , the German media were reporting that no confirmed CCD cases seemed to have occurred in Germany.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a></p>
<p>As of 2009, the number of reported cases of CCD in the U.S. had dropped considerably; over the 2008/2009 winter, a total loss of 28.6% of managed honey bee colonies was recorded in the U.S., and only 15% of that subset (equal to only 4.3% of the national total) died with symptoms of CCD.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> The winter of 2009/2010, however, saw an increase to 33.8% overwintering mortality among surveyed beekeepers,<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> though no statistics are available for the proportion attributed to CCD.</p>
<h2 id="society-and-culture">Society and culture</h2>
<h3 id="economics">Economics</h3>

<p>The phenomenon is particularly important for crops such as <a href="almond" class="uri" title="wikilink">almond</a> growing in <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>, where honey bees are the predominant pollinator and the crop value in 2006 was $1.5 billion. In 2000, the total U.S. crop value that was wholly dependent on honey bee pollination was estimated to exceed $15 billion.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
<p>Honey bees are not native to the Americas, therefore their necessity as pollinators in the U.S. is limited to strictly agricultural/ornamental uses, as no native plants require honey bee pollination, except where concentrated in <a href="monoculture" class="uri" title="wikilink">monoculture</a> situations&lt;U+2014&gt;where the pollination need is so great at bloom time that pollinators must be concentrated beyond the capacity of native bees (with current technology).</p>
<p>They are responsible for <a href="pollination" class="uri" title="wikilink">pollination</a> of approximately one third of the United States' <a href="crop" class="uri" title="wikilink">crop</a> species, including such species as <a href="almond" title="wikilink">almonds</a>, <a href="peach" title="wikilink">peaches</a>, <a href="soybean" title="wikilink">soybeans</a>, <a href="apple" title="wikilink">apples</a>, <a href="pear" title="wikilink">pears</a>, <a href="cherry" title="wikilink">cherries</a>, <a href="raspberry" title="wikilink">raspberries</a>, <a href="blackberry" title="wikilink">blackberries</a>, <a href="Cranberry" title="wikilink">cranberries</a>, <a href="watermelon" title="wikilink">watermelons</a>, <a href="cantaloupe" title="wikilink">cantaloupes</a>, <a href="cucumber" title="wikilink">cucumbers</a> and <a href="strawberry" title="wikilink">strawberries</a>. Many but not all of these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in small holdings in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., <a href="squash_bee" title="wikilink">squash bees</a> on cucurbits<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a>), but typically not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is a presumption that native pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that specific area).</p>
<p>However, even though on a per-individual basis, many other species are actually more efficient at pollinating, on the 30% of crop types where honey bees are used, most native pollinators cannot be mass-utilized as easily or as effectively as honey bees&lt;U+2014&gt;in many instances they will not visit the plants at all. Beehives can be moved from crop to crop as needed, and the bees will visit many plants in large numbers, compensating via <a href="saturation_pollination" title="wikilink">saturation pollination</a> for what they lack in efficiency. The commercial viability of these crops is therefore strongly tied to the <a href="beekeeping" class="uri" title="wikilink">beekeeping</a> industry. In China, hand pollination of apple orchards is labor intensive, time consuming and costly.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="in-the-media">In the media</h3>
<p>A number of documentaries have been produced in which possible causes of CCD have been explored. The 2009 documentary <a href="Vanishing_of_the_Bees" title="wikilink">Vanishing of the Bees</a> points to the neonicotinoid category of pesticides as being the most likely culprit, though the experts interviewed concede that no firm data yet exists.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;Silence of the Bees&quot; (Oct, 2007) is a part of the <a href="Nature_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Nature (TV series)</a> and covers several recent investigative discoveries.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a></p>
<p>The 2008 film &quot;<a href="The_Happening_(2008_film)" title="wikilink">The Happening</a>&quot; has a theme which relates CCD and the events of the film as &quot;an act of nature which we will never fully understand&quot;.</p>
<p>One of the segments of the 2010 <em><a href="Futurama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Futurama</a></em> episode &quot;<a href="The_Futurama_Holiday_Spectacular" title="wikilink">The Futurama Holiday Spectacular</a>&quot; dealt with CCD; the depiction included a colony of giant space bees fighting the disorder.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>In the United Kingdom, a national bee database is to be set up to monitor colony collapse as a result of a 15% reduction in the bee population over the last two years.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> In particular, the register, funded by the <a href="Department_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs" title="wikilink">Department for the Environment</a> and administered by the <a href="National_Bee_Unit" title="wikilink">National Bee Unit</a>, will be used to monitor health trends and help establish whether the honey industry is under threat from supposed colony collapse disorder. Britain's 20,000 beekeepers have been invited to participate.</p>
