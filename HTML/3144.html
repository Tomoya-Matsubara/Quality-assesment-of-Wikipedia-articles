<p>The <strong>mummichog</strong>, is a small <a href="killifish" class="uri" title="wikilink">killifish</a> found in the eastern <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>.</p>
<p>The mummichog spawns on new and full moons in the spring and summer. Its eggs are laid near the high tide mark and can tolerate long-term exposure to air. The eggs are used in teaching <a href="embryology" class="uri" title="wikilink">embryology</a>, because it is possible to see the eyes and the beating <a href="heart" class="uri" title="wikilink">heart</a> and follow the different stages of <a href="ontogenesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">ontogenesis</a>. These <a href="fish" class="uri" title="wikilink">fish</a> are used to stock otherwise fishless ponds that breed <a href="mosquito" title="wikilink">mosquitos</a>, and within three days the ponds are normally mosquito free.</p>
<p>Because of the extreme hardiness of the species, it is sometimes the only species found in severely polluted and <a href="oxygen" class="uri" title="wikilink">oxygen</a>-deprived streams, such as the Elizabeth River in Virginia, and the <a href="Hackensack_River" title="wikilink">Hackensack River</a> and the <a href="Arthur_Kill" title="wikilink">Arthur Kill</a> in <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a> during the height of the water pollution problem in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. In 1973 the mummichog became the first fish in space when carried on <a href="Skylab_3" title="wikilink">Skylab 3</a> as part of the biological experiments package later space missions by the U.S., such as <a href="Bion_3" title="wikilink">Bion 3</a>, have also carried mummichog.</p>
