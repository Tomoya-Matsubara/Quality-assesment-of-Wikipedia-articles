Wolves at that time were especially numerous in the districts bordering Wales, which were heavily forested.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> This imposition was maintained until the <a href="Norman_conquest_of_England" title="wikilink">Norman conquest of England</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> At the time, several criminals, rather than being put to death, would be ordered to provide a certain number of wolf tongues annually.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The monk Galfrid, whilst writing on the miracles of <a href="St._Cuthbert" title="wikilink">St. Cuthbert</a> seven centuries earlier, observed that wolves were so numerous in Northumbria, that it was virtually impossible for even the richest flock-masters to protect their sheep, despite employing many men for the job.

Officially, this hunting season would end on March 25, thus it encompassed the cubbing season when wolves were at their most vulnerable, and their fur was of greater quality.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The <a href="Norman_dynasty" title="wikilink">Norman</a> kings (reigning from 1066 to 1152 A.D.) employed servants as wolf hunters and many held lands granted on condition they fulfilled this duty. <a href="William_the_Conquerer" title="wikilink">William the Conquerer</a> granted the lordship of Riddesdale in Northumberland to Robert de Umfraville on condition that he defend that land from enemies and wolves.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> There were no restrictions or penalties in the hunting of wolves, except in royal game reserves, under the reasoning that the temptation for a commoner to shoot a deer there was too great<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>. English wolves were more often trapped than hunted. Indeed, the Wolfhunt family, who resided in Peak forest in the 13th century, would march into the forest in March and December, and place <a href="pitch_(resin)" title="wikilink">pitch</a> in the areas were wolves frequented. At that time of year, wolves would have had greater difficulty in smelling the pitch than in others.

Cuvier later pointed out that the number of wolf bones in Kirkdale were even fewer than originally thought, as a lot of teeth first referred to belong to wolves turned out to be those of juvenile hyenas. The few positively identified wolf remains were thought to have been transported to the cave system by hyenas for consumption. <a href="William_Buckland" title="wikilink">William Buckland</a>, in his <em>Reliquiae Diluvianae</em>, wrote that he only found one molar tooth which could be positively identified as being that of a wolf, while other bone fragments were indistinguishable from those of <a href="domestic_dog" title="wikilink">domestic dogs</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>In the Paviland <a href="limestone" class="uri" title="wikilink">limestone</a> caves of the <a href="Gower_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Gower Peninsula</a> in south <a href="Wales" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wales</a>, the jaw, heel-bone and several metatarsals were found of a large canid, though it was impossible to definitively prove that they belonged to a wolf rather than a large dog.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>In a series of caves discovered in a quarry in <a href="Oreston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oreston</a>, <a href="Plymouth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plymouth</a>, a Mr. Whidbey found several bones and teeth of a species of <em>canis</em> indistinguishable from modern wolves. <a href="Richard_Owen" title="wikilink">Richard Owen</a> examined a jaw bone excavated from Oreston, which he remarked was from a subadult animal with evidence of having been enlarged by exotosis and <a href="ulceration" class="uri" title="wikilink">ulceration</a>, probably due to a fight with another wolf. The other bones showed evidence of having been gnawed by small animals, and many were further damaged by workmen in their efforts to extricate them from the clay. Unlike the Kirkdale wolves, the Oreston remains showed no evidence of having been gnawed on by hyenas.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>An almost entire skull with missing teeth was discovered in <a href="Kents_Cavern" title="wikilink">Kents Cavern</a> by a Mr. Mac Enery. The skull was exactly equal in size to that of an <a href="Arctic_wolf" title="wikilink">Arctic wolf</a>, the only notable differences being that the sectorial molar was slightly larger and the lower border of the jaw was more convex. It was positively identified as being that of a wolf by its low and contracted forehead.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reintroduction-to-scotland">Reintroduction to Scotland</h2>
<p>In 1999, Dr Martyn Gorman, senior lecturer in zoology at <a href="Aberdeen_University" title="wikilink">Aberdeen University</a> and vice chairman of the UK Mammal Society called for a reintroduction of wolves to the Scottish Highlands in order to deal with the then 350,000 <a href="red_deer" title="wikilink">red deer</a> damaging young trees in commercial forests. Scottish National Heritage considered re-establishing carefully controlled colonies of wolves, but shelved the idea following an outcry from sheep farmers.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2002, Paul van Vlissingen, a wealthy landowner at Letterewe, Achnasheen, Ross-shire, in the Western Highlands, proposed the reintroduction of both wolves and lynxes to Scotland, stating that current deer culling methods were inadequate, and that wolves would boost the Scottish tourist industry.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2007, British and Norwegian researchers which included experts from the <a href="Imperial_College_London" title="wikilink">Imperial College London</a> said that wolf reintroduction into the Scottish Highlands would aid the re-establishment of plants and birds currently hampered by the deer population. The study also assessed people's attitudes towards the idea of releasing wolves into the wild. While the public were generally positive, people living in rural areas were more sensitive, though they were open to the idea provided they would be reimbursed for livestock losses.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Richard Morley, of the <em>Wolves and Humans Foundation</em> (formerly the <em>The Wolf Society of Great Britain</em>), forecast in 2007 that public support for wolf reintroduction would grow over the next 15 years, though he criticised previous talks as being too &quot;simple or romantic&quot;. He stated that although wolves would be good for tourism, farmers and crofters have serious concerns about the effect wolves could have on their livestock, particularly sheep, that have to be acknowledged.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
