<p>Many leaders of the <a href="G-20_major_economies" title="wikilink">G-20</a> were divided among different issues that they wanted to discuss at the summit.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The prime focus of the summit discussions was the recovery from the ongoing <a href="Late-2000s_recession" title="wikilink">global recession</a> and the <a href="2010_European_sovereign_debt_crisis" title="wikilink">European debt crisis</a>.

Among the specifics proposed by the European Union were a global <a href="bank_tax" title="wikilink">bank tax</a> and a <a href="Robin_Hood_tax" title="wikilink">Robin Hood tax</a>, but these plans were opposed by the United States and <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Other topics of concern were <a href="international_development" title="wikilink">international development</a> and continuing <a href="international_aid" title="wikilink">international aid</a> to <a href="Africa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Africa</a> and other developing nations.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Criticism of <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a>'s <a href="Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip_(2007&lt;U+2013&gt;present)" title="wikilink">Gaza strip blockade</a> and criticism of the nuclear programs of <a href="North_Korea" title="wikilink">North Korea</a> was expressed.

Early opposition to the G-20 included an incident in <a href="Ottawa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ottawa</a> where a bank was firebombed by <a href="anarchism" title="wikilink">anarchists</a>, who claimed they would be present during the G-20 summit in Toronto.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The perceived security threat caused the <a href="Integrated_Security_Unit" title="wikilink">Integrated Security Unit</a> to increase security measures.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>Protests began one week ahead of the summit, organized by groups including <a href="Oxfam_Canada" title="wikilink">Oxfam Canada</a> and the <a href="Ontario_Coalition_Against_Poverty" title="wikilink">Ontario Coalition Against Poverty</a>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Issues such as <a href="poverty" class="uri" title="wikilink">poverty</a>,<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> <a href="LGBT_rights_in_Canada" title="wikilink">gay rights</a>,<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> <a href="capitalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">capitalism</a> and <a href="globalization" class="uri" title="wikilink">globalization</a>,<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> <a href="indigenous_rights" title="wikilink">indigenous rights</a>,<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> and <a href="#Controversies" title="wikilink">controversial issues with the Toronto summit</a> were the object of protests.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Despite a few arrests, protests over the week were mainly determined to be peaceful.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>As the first day of the summit approached, protesters grew in numbers. Several streets were closed down for demonstrations on the debut of the summit. Peaceful protests were followed by <a href="black_bloc" title="wikilink">black bloc</a> tactics as individuals dressed in black dispersed from the crowd and began damaging the windows of particular businesses across Downtown Toronto, mostly <a href="List_of_fast_food_restaurants" title="wikilink">fast food chains</a>, retail stores and banks, as well as local businesses.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> <a href="Police_car" title="wikilink">Police cruisers</a> were set on fire and vehicles of media corporations were damaged.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Nearby hospitals, shopping centres, and hotels were put in a <a href="lockdown" class="uri" title="wikilink">lockdown</a> mode while public transit services were diverted from Downtown to other locations.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>As security was further tightened and forces increased in presence the following day, protests against police brutality occurred in front of the <a href="Eastern_Avenue_(Toronto)" title="wikilink">Eastern Avenue</a> temporary detention centre, where nearly 500 arrested individuals were kept from the previous day's riots.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> A group of protesters was also &quot;<a href="kettling" title="wikilink">kettled</a>&quot; for several hours through the night after black bloc protesters were believed to be in the crowd.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Over 900 people were confirmed to be arrested over the week.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> The ISU performed sweeping arrests within a specific boundary from the summit venue.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> However, despite media coverage informing the public that officers had the power to demand identification and to detain people within five metres of the site, it was later found that no such law existed.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Individuals arrested during the <a href="2010_G-20_Toronto_summit_protests" title="wikilink">protests</a> condemned the treatment they received from police.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>

This was partially due to most countries' entering recovery mode from the <a href="Late-2000s_recession" title="wikilink">global economic recession</a> after the past <a href="List_of_G-20_summits" title="wikilink">G-20 summits</a>; thus, the likelihood of new issues being raised was minimal.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>During the working dinner for G-20 leaders on the evening of June 26, South African president <a href="Jacob_Zuma" title="wikilink">Jacob Zuma</a> promoted more partnership between the international community and Africa for the development in the continent. &quot;As Africa we bring to the G20 Summit the key message that we must, together as the developing and developed worlds, promote stronger and more effective and equal international partnerships for growth and development,&quot; he remarked.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>At the summit, US president <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a> warned that global recovery was still &quot;fragile.&quot; In hopes of boosting American exports, he announced the proposal of a <a href="free_trade_agreement" title="wikilink">free trade agreement</a> between the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> and <a href="South_Korea" title="wikilink">South Korea</a>.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> A key agreement the leaders of <a href="Developed_country" title="wikilink">deleveloped nations</a> made was to cut annual budget deficits in half by 2013.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> The leaders also agreed on reducing <a href="debt-to-GDP_ratio" title="wikilink">debt-to-GDP ratio</a> in each economy by 2016.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The debate on imposing a <a href="bank_tax" title="wikilink">tax on financial institutions</a> was settled as the group decided that <a href="financial_institution" title="wikilink">financial institutions</a> would be required to make fair contributions to recover costs from the financial sector reform,<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> but the way the contributions would be collected would be up to each government.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> It was also decided that institutions would be required to keep a higher amount of <a href="financial_capital" title="wikilink">financial capital</a> in case of future <a href="Shock_(economics)" title="wikilink">financial shocks</a>.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> <a href="Climate_change" title="wikilink">Climate change</a> and <a href="food_security" title="wikilink">food security</a> were also discussed; the leaders reiterated their commitment to a &quot;<a href="environmentally_friendly" title="wikilink">greener</a> growth&quot;<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>

The <a href="International_Monetary_Fund" title="wikilink">International Monetary Fund</a>, in its post-summit document, indicated that a speedy cut in deficits may substantially slow growth. In a publication titled <em>Top Ten Commandments for Fiscal Adjustment in Advanced Economies</em>, the organization insisted that balanced public spending could stabilize <a href="bond_market" title="wikilink">bond markets</a>, reduce interest rates from less government spending, and encourage private investment. It also recommended that emerging economies such as <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>, which has largely benefited from trade surpluses, rely less on developed nations and increase their own spending in order to promote domestic demand.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="financial-costs">Financial costs</h3>
<p>The financial costs of hosting the <a href="36th_G8_summit" title="wikilink">G8</a> and G-20 summits was the topic of several political debates and the target of criticism by local groups.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> The reasons for the large price for both summits were questioned by a few politicians and local groups. Members of Parliament <a href="Olivia_Chow" title="wikilink">Olivia Chow</a> and <a href="Mark_Holland" title="wikilink">Mark Holland</a> labelled the initially claimed budget of $1.1-billion for hosting the summits as &quot;obscene&quot; and &quot;insane&quot; while others argued that the money could have been used for long-pending municipal projects in Canada,<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> such as Toronto's <a href="Transit_City" title="wikilink">Transit City</a>.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> The security cost for the two summits was believed to be more expensive than the combined security costs of the <a href="2010_Winter_Olympics" title="wikilink">2010 Winter Olympics</a> and <a href="2010_Winter_Paralympics" title="wikilink">Paralympics</a> in <a href="Vancouver" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vancouver</a> and <a href="Whistler,_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">Whistler, British Columbia</a>, which were .<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> However, according to final calculations from the <a href="House_of_Commons_of_Canada" title="wikilink">House of Commons of Canada</a> as of October 2010, the exact cost for holding both summits was $857,901,850.31,<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> making it less expensive than the security costs for the 2010 Winter Olympics.</p>

<p>The creation of the $23-million international media centre, which included the  <em>Experience Canada</em> pavilion and $57,000 artificial lake, at the <a href="Exhibition_Place" title="wikilink">Exhibition Place</a> was widely opposed and criticized by politicians as &quot;a waste of taxpayers' money.&quot;<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Criticism mostly targeted Stephen Harper and Canada's <a href="Conservative_Party_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Conservative government</a>.

<h3 id="economic-impact">Economic impact</h3>
<p>The summit's economic impact was a major concern of a few local politicians and citizens. The <a href="municipal_government_of_Toronto" title="wikilink">municipal government of Toronto</a>, as well as some public representatives, previously argued that the G-20 summit should be held at an isolated venue, such as the <a href="Exhibition_Place" title="wikilink">Exhibition Place</a>, rather than the <a href="Metro_Toronto_Convention_Centre" title="wikilink">Metro Toronto Convention Centre</a>, which is located in the city's <a href="central_business_district" title="wikilink">central business district</a>.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> As a result, during the aftermath of <a href="#Protests" title="wikilink">the protests during the summit</a>, when several business and properties in <a href="Downtown_Toronto" title="wikilink">Downtown Toronto</a> were damaged, mayor <a href="David_Miller_(Canadian_politician)" title="wikilink">David Miller</a> urged the federal government to compensate for all the damages. It was initially outlined by the government that only damages to businesses within the security zone would be compensated. However, all damages occurred outside of the security zone. Some businesses in the downtown core suffered financially as a result.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> According to Member of Parliament <a href="John_McCallum" title="wikilink">John McCallum</a>, &quot;Stephen Harper made a huge mistake in holding this summit in downtown Toronto.&quot; According to the <em><a href="Toronto_Star" title="wikilink">Toronto Star</a></em>, at least 40 stores in the <a href="Downtown_Yonge" title="wikilink">Downtown Yonge Business Improvement Area</a> suffered damages and one repair firm performed up to  in repairs.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>

<p>On June 17, the <a href="United_States_Department_of_State" title="wikilink">United States Department of State</a> issued a travel alert for Toronto, warning tourists of the expected traffic disruptions and potentially violent protests during the G-20 summit.

<p>During the midst of Toronto summit, a few overseas reporters commented on Canada and the summits. A reporter of the <a href="BBC" title="wikilink">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> (BBC) made positive remarks about Canada's economy, saying &quot;The Canadians, it seems, have answers for even the toughest puzzles and they are keen to share their strategies with the rest of the world.
