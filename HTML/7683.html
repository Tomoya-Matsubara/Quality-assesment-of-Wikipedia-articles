He served in this capacity from March 1958 until March 1959, when he retired from the army.</p>

Graduating from the college in December 1919, he was <a href="Officer_(armed_forces)" title="wikilink">commissioned</a> as a <a href="First_Lieutenant" title="wikilink">lieutenant</a> in the Australian Army, and posted to <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a> for further training.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>On his return to Australia, Wells was appointed as <a href="adjutant" class="uri" title="wikilink">adjutant</a> and <a href="quartermaster" class="uri" title="wikilink">quartermaster</a> of the 8th Light Horse Regiment in 1921. The following year, he was allocated to the 9th Light Horse Regiment. In February 1926, Wells was briefly appointed <a href="brigade_major" title="wikilink">brigade major</a> of the 6th Cavalry Brigade, before becoming an instructor at the Small Arms School, Sydney, during July. On 14 December that year, Wells married Lorna Irene Skippen in a ceremony at St John's Church of England, <a href="Cessnock,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Cessnock</a>; the couple would later have two sons.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>During 1927, Wells was assigned to the Royal Military College, Duntroon as a company commander and promoted to <a href="Captain_(land)" title="wikilink">captain</a> that December. Returning to the Small Arms School as an instructor in 1931, he was dispatched to England and attended the <a href="Staff_College,_Camberley" title="wikilink">Staff College, Camberley</a> between 1935 and 1936. Arriving back in Australia, Wells was made adjutant and quartermaster of the 4th/3rd Battalion, and later brigade major of the <a href="1st_Brigade_(Australia)" title="wikilink">1st Infantry Brigade</a>. During 1938, he was reposted to Royal Military College, Duntroon as a lecturer in <a href="Military_tactics" title="wikilink">tactics</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Promoted to <a href="colonel" class="uri" title="wikilink">colonel</a>, Wells became General Staff Officer, 1st Grade (GSO1), to the <a href="9th_Division_(Australia)" title="wikilink">9th Division</a> in November 1941.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> As such, he was the 9th Division's chief of staff, responsible for the full range of staff activities.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> On 28 June 1942, Wells accompanied Lieutenant General <a href="Leslie_Morshead" title="wikilink">Sir Leslie Morshead</a>—Commander of the 9th Division—to <a href="Cairo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cairo</a>, where they received orders tasking the 9th Division with the defence of Cairo.

<p>Raised to substantive lieutenant general on 12 April 1954,<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Wells was appointed a <a href="Companion_of_the_Order_of_the_Bath" title="wikilink">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in the <a href="Queen&#39;s_Birthday_Honours" title="wikilink">Queen's Birthday Honours</a> that June.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> He was commended for his &quot;exceptional meritorious service&quot; in Korea,<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> and awarded the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> <a href="Legion_of_Merit" title="wikilink">Legion of Merit</a> in the degree of Commander.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Presented with the decoration by General <a href="John_E._Hull" title="wikilink">John E. Hull</a> on 19 October,<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Wells returned to Australia three days later.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> In December, he was made Chief of the General Staff; the professional head of the Australian Army. Wells' appointment coincided with the commitment of Australian forces to the <a href="Malayan_Emergency" title="wikilink">Malayan Emergency</a>, and as such he presided over the deployment of soldiers to the engagement as well as the formation of the first regular brigade group.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> He was upgraded to a <a href="Knight_Commander_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the 1956 New Years Honours.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>On 23 March 1958, Wells was appointed the first Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC); the professional head of the Australian Military.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> The position had previously existed as an extension to the responsibilities of the senior service chief—either the <a href="Chief_of_Navy_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of Naval Staff</a>, Chief of the General Staff or <a href="Chief_of_Air_Force_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of the Air Staff</a>—but Wells was the first to occupy the position as a separate post. The chairmanship of COSC was created as part of the <a href="Australian_Government" title="wikilink">Australian Government</a>'s response to a review of the Defence group of departments conducted by Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead in 1957, which recommended greater centralisation of the armed forces. Although the Chairman was the Government's principal military advisor and reported directly to the <a href="Minister_for_Defence_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Minister for Defence</a>, Wells was not promoted and remained at the same rank as the heads of the <a href="Royal_Australian_Navy" title="wikilink">Navy</a>, Army and <a href="Royal_Australian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Air Force</a>. He was also hampered by being given only a small staff. The role of the Chairman, COSC was not strengthened until 1965, when <a href="Air_Marshal_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Air Marshal</a> <a href="Frederick_Scherger" title="wikilink">Sir Frederick Scherger</a>—who had been appointed to the position in 1961—was promoted to <a href="Air_Chief_Marshal_(Australia)" title="wikilink">air chief marshal</a> so that he out-ranked the service heads.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Wells served in this capacity until his retirement from the Australian military on 22 March 1959.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="retirement">Retirement</h2>
<p>In retirement, Wells was appointed as a director to several companies, including Broken Hill South Ltd, Metal Manufactures Ltd, Navcot Australia Pty Ltd and Sitmar Line (Australia) Pty Ltd. During April 1961, Wells was appointed honorary colonel of the <a href="Royal_Victoria_Regiment" title="wikilink">Royal Victoria Regiment</a>. Described as &quot;somewhat reserved and taciturn&quot; during his life,<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Wells died at <a href="Yarrawonga,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Yarrawonga</a>, <a href="Victoria_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Victoria</a>, on 20 October 1973, and was survived by his wife and their two sons. His funeral service took place with full military honours at Toorak Presbyterian Church, after which he was cremated. In his will, Wells bequeathed a sizable proportion of his estate to <a href="Legacy_Australia" title="wikilink">Junior Legacy</a>, Melbourne.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Wells Road, a street in <a href="Duntroon,_Australian_Capital_Territory" title="wikilink">Duntroon</a>, <a href="Australian_Capital_Territory" title="wikilink">Australian Capital Territory</a>, is named in his honour.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
