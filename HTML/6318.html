<p>Of McCain's loss, Huntsman observed &quot;We're fundamentally staring down a demographic shift that we've never seen before in America.&quot;<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> On November 12, 2008 <a href="Politico_(newspaper)" title="wikilink">Politico</a> called him a possible 2012 contender.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Washington Post blogger <a href="Chris_Cillizza" title="wikilink">Chris Cillizza</a> also speculated Huntsman as a possible candidate.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p>In August 2010, a group of political strategists close to Huntsman formed a <a href="political_action_committee" title="wikilink">political action committee</a> now called Horizon PAC that could provide a framework for launching Huntsman's campaign.

<h3 id="post-campaign-politics">Post-Campaign Politics</h3>
<p>A month after dropping out of the race, Huntsman offered the opinion that there was a need for a <a href="Third_party_(politics)" title="wikilink">third party</a> in America. In an appearance on the MSNBC talk show <em><a href="Morning_Joe" title="wikilink">Morning Joe</a></em> on February 23, 2012, Huntsman said that a third party would be a healthy development in the presidential election process. Huntsman said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think we&lt;U+2019&gt;re going to have problems politically until we get some sort of third party movement or some voice out there that can put forth new ideas. Someone&lt;U+2019&gt;s going to step up at some point and say we&lt;U+2019&gt;ve had enough of this. The real issues are not being addressed and it&lt;U+2019&gt;s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huntsman said he was not throwing his own hat in the ring as a third party presidential candidate in 2012.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Republican_National_Committee" title="wikilink">Republican National Committee</a> reacted by withdrawing an invitation for Huntsman to appear at a Republican fundraiser in Palm Beach, Florida, in early March. Huntsman was scheduled as a speaker at the event.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>In early July 2012, Huntsman announced that he would not be attending the <a href="2012_Republican_National_Convention" title="wikilink">2012 Republican National Convention</a> for the first time since he attended as a <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Reagan delegate</a> in 1984. Huntsman issued a statement chiding the Republican Party for what he perceived as its failures to focus on the daunting socio-economic issues facing America.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will not be attending this year's convention, nor any Republican convention in the future until the party focuses on a bigger, bolder, more confident future for the United States &lt;U+2014&gt; a future based on problem solving, inclusiveness, and a willingness to address the trust deficit, which is every bit as corrosive as our fiscal and economic deficits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huntsman, whose presidential campaign slogan had been &quot;Country First&quot;,<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> also said in his statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I encourage a return to the party we have been in the past, from Lincoln right on through to Reagan, that was always willing to put our country before politics.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>

<p>Huntsman has been described by the <em><a href="Huffington_Post" title="wikilink">Huffington Post</a></em> as &quot;a conservative <a href="Technocracy" title="wikilink">technocrat</a>-optimist with moderate positions who was willing to work substantively with President <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a>&quot;<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> and identifies himself as a center-right conservative.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>As governor, Huntsman listed economic development, health-care reform, education, and energy security as his top priorities. He oversaw tax cuts and advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so that the government would not become overwhelmed by the state's fast growing population. He also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> In 2007, when asked about a <a href="healthcare_mandate" title="wikilink">healthcare mandate</a>, Huntsman said, &quot;I'm comfortable with a requirement &lt;U+2013&gt; you can call it whatever you want, but at some point we're going to have to get serious about how we deal with this issue&quot;.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>

He was particularly lauded for his efforts to cut taxes. The report specifically highlighted his reductions of the sales tax and simplification of the tax code.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> However, the report concluded that: &quot;Unfortunately, Huntsman has completely dropped the ball on spending, with per capita spending increasing at about 10 percent annually during his tenure.&quot;<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> He defines his taxation policy as &quot;business friendly&quot;.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>As part of his presidential campaign, Huntsman claimed that &quot;our tax code has devolved into a maze of special-interest carve-outs, loopholes and temporary provisions that cost taxpayers more than $400 billion a year to comply with.&quot; The candidate called for &quot;[getting] rid of all tax expenditures, all loopholes, all deductions, all subsidies. Use that to lower rates across the board. And do it on a revenue-neutral basis.&quot;<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition, Huntsman has proposed reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%, eliminating corporate taxes on income earned overseas, and implementing a tax holiday for repatriation of corporate profits. He favors eliminating taxes on capital gains and dividends.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>

Much of this discussion happened before the bottom fell out of the economy, and until it comes back, this isn't the moment.&quot;<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> &quot;There's not enough information right now to formulate policies in terms of addressing it over all, primarily because it's a global issue,&quot; Huntsman said. &quot;We can enact policies here, but I wouldn't want to unilaterally disarm as a country. I wouldn't want to hinder job creators at a time when our economy is flat.&quot;<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="foreign-policy">Foreign policy</h3>
<p>Huntsman has repeatedly stated, &quot;We need to continue working closely with China to convince <a href="North_Korea" title="wikilink">North Korea</a> to abandon its nuclear weapons program.&quot; He has also named Taiwan, human rights, and Tibet among the &quot;areas where we have differences with China&quot; and vowed &quot;robust engagement&quot; on human rights if confirmed. The governor, who lived in <a href="Taiwan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taiwan</a> as a <a href="Mormon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mormon</a> missionary, said he felt &quot;personally invested in the peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences, in a way that respects the wishes of the people on both Taiwan and the mainland. He said that current US policy &quot;supports this objective, and I have been encouraged by the recent relaxing of cross-strait tensions.&quot;<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Huntsman is a strong supporter of Israel and has made several visits to Israel.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>

After intense lobbying, Romney was chosen, and the Huntsman family was &quot;livid&quot;, and in 2011 Huntsman said he was &quot;being used&quot; and Romney's selection was &quot;precooked&quot;.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> As Romney prepared his <a href="Mitt_Romney_presidential_campaign,_2008" title="wikilink">2008 presidential run</a>, he began consulting Huntsman on foreign policy and trade issues.
