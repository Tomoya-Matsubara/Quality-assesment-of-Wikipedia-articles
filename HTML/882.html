<p>The <strong>Westgate</strong> is a <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">medieval</a> <a href="gatehouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">gatehouse</a> in <a href="Canterbury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canterbury</a>, <a href="Kent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kent</a>, <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>. This 60-foot-high western gate of the <a href="defensive_wall" title="wikilink">city wall</a> is the largest surviving city gate in England. Built of Kentish <a href="rag-stone" title="wikilink">ragstone</a> around 1379, it is still well-preserved and is one of the city's most distinctive landmarks: the last survivor of Canterbury's seven medieval gates. The road still passes between its drum towers, and there is just enough room for a <a href="double-decker_bus" title="wikilink">double-decker bus</a> to pass beneath. This <a href="scheduled_monument" title="wikilink">scheduled monument</a> and Grade I <a href="listed_building" title="wikilink">listed building</a> houses the hundred-year-old West Gate Towers Museum, which is open to the public during limited hours on Saturdays and by special arrangement for groups on weekdays. Access to the museum and roof is via <a href="stairway" title="wikilink">spiral staircases</a> only.</p>

<p><img src="Westgate_002.jpg" title="fig:Westgate Towers in Edwardian era" alt="Westgate Towers in Edwardian era" /> <img src="Westgate_070.jpg" title="fig:Vaulting under arch with murder holes" alt="Vaulting under arch with murder holes" /> Canterbury was <a href="defensive_wall" title="wikilink">walled</a> by the <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Romans</a> around 300 <a href="Anno_Domini" title="wikilink">AD</a>. This has been consistently the most important of the city's gates as it is the London Road entrance and the main entrance from most of Kent. The present towers are a <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">medieval</a> replacement of the Roman west gate, rebuilt around 1380. There was a gate here at the time of the <a href="Norman_conquest_of_England" title="wikilink">Norman conquest</a>, which is thought to have been Roman. From late <a href="Anglo-Saxons" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon</a> times it had the Church of the Holy Cross on top, but both church and gate were dismantled in 1379, and the gate was rebuilt by <a href="Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Archbishop</a> <a href="Simon_Sudbury" title="wikilink">Simon Sudbury</a> before he died in the <a href="Peasants&#39;_Revolt" title="wikilink">Peasants' Revolt</a> of 1381.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> It has been suggested that it was built primarily as an entrance for <a href="pilgrim" title="wikilink">pilgrims</a> visiting the shrine of <a href="Thomas_Becket" title="wikilink">St Thomas Becket</a> at the <a href="Canterbury_Cathedral" title="wikilink">cathedral</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> However the rebuild as a defensive status symbol was paid for partly by Sudbury and partly by taxation for military protection against expected raids by the French.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> It has been suggested that the spiral staircases were built to the disadvantage of defenders going downstairs who would have had to to fight invaders climbing up to their right: difficult with a one-handed sword in the right hand. However, slashing with a double-handed sword or pikestaff might have been easier.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Westgate_076.jpg" title="fig:North tower gunloop" alt="North tower gunloop" /> It is expensively faced in <a href="Course_(architecture)" title="wikilink">coursed</a> <a href="ashlar" class="uri" title="wikilink">ashlar</a> of Kentish <a href="rag-stone" title="wikilink">ragstone</a>. It has battered plinths to the drum towers, <a href="battlement" title="wikilink">battlements</a>, <a href="machicolation" title="wikilink">machicolations</a> and eighteen <a href="embrasure" title="wikilink">gunloops</a>: a high number for a gateway, and among the earliest gunholes in Britain. The gunloops would have been added by the beginning of the fifteenth century. It had a <a href="drawbridge" class="uri" title="wikilink">drawbridge</a> over the <a href="River_Stour,_Kent" title="wikilink">Stour</a>, a <a href="portcullis" class="uri" title="wikilink">portcullis</a> and wooden doors.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The gateway has three floors. The ground floor was designed so that the gateway and <a href="Vault_(architecture)" title="wikilink">vaulted</a> passage had entrances to the towers on each side. Each tower had a ground-floor room with fireplace and four gunloops. The north tower's ground-floor room had a <a href="stairway" title="wikilink">spiral staircase</a> to upper floors. The first floor contains a large room with fireplace and, originally, the portcullis mechanism over the vaulted entranceway. This room had doors to the upper room of each tower, each with fireplace and three gunloops, and a northern door to a spiral staircase leading to the roof. Repairs were carried out due to an invasion scare during the 1470s and 1480s. In 1491 or 1492 a large, two-light, <a href="Transom_(architectural)" title="wikilink">transomed</a>, <a href="English_Gothic_architecture" title="wikilink">perpendicular</a> east window was added to the large first-floor room, with a view towards the <a href="Canterbury_Cathedral" title="wikilink">cathedral</a> and along St Peter's Street. The roof over the large first-floor central room has a battlemented <a href="parapet" class="uri" title="wikilink">parapet</a> walk, originally with access to the tops of both towers and machicolations, as well as to the two low chambers, each with two gunports, in the tops of both towers. This part of the tower was less well-built than the lower storeys, either due to haste during the <a href="Peasants&#39;_Revolt" title="wikilink">Peasants' Revolt</a> or because it was built later. In 1793&lt;U+2212&gt;1794 the hall over the gate was split into three and the present square <a href="cupola" title="wikilink">lantern</a> added to the roof, along with the wooden doors and cell linings which are visible today; the cost was &lt;U+00A3&gt;400.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Westgate_021.jpg" title="fig:Spiral staircase" alt="Spiral staircase" /> The city walls joined the gateway at the back of the drum towers, but this part of the wall was removed in the nineteenth century. Following this, in 1823&lt;U+2212&gt;1829, a jailer's house was built on the north side, and this became a police station and is now a music school. The disused iron bridge which connects the Westgate with the music school dates from this time. Contemporary with this work was the building of St Peter's Place on the south side of the Westgate, along with passages around the Westgte and a new road across the <a href="River_Stour,_Kent" title="wikilink">Stour</a>, to cope with increased traffic, which has been damaging the arch of the building for one hundred and fifty years.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>At the end of the 19th century the Westgate was a temporary repository for the city <a href="archive" title="wikilink">archives</a> until the museum was opened in 1908. It is the largest surviving city gate in England.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Westgate_066.jpg" title="fig:Cell doors" alt="Cell doors" /> <img src="Canterbury_Westgate.jpg" title="fig:West Gate Towers next to River Stour" alt="West Gate Towers next to River Stour" /> Canterbury's <a href="mayor" class="uri" title="wikilink">mayor</a> and <a href="Municipal_corporation" title="wikilink">corporation</a> were grateful to this <a href="martyr" class="uri" title="wikilink">martyr</a> to the Revolt who had built them an additional attraction for pilgrims, and they would pray at his tomb or under the Westgate. The head of the rebellious Bluebeard the Hermit was displayed on Westgate in 1450 after he was caught by local people and sent to <a href="Henry_VI_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry VI</a>. It is thought that <a href="Geoffrey_Chaucer" title="wikilink">Geoffrey Chaucer</a> may have undertaken a pilgrimage and passed through the gate. In 1648 after the <a href="Pride&#39;s_Purge" title="wikilink">Christmas Day riot</a>, <a href="Roundhead" title="wikilink">Parliamentarians</a> burnt down all the wooden doors of the city's gates. They were all replaced in 1660, but these replacements were removed at the end of the eighteenth century. They were similar to the surviving wooden <a href=":File:Christ_Church_Gate,_Canterbury.jpg" title="wikilink">Christ Church gates</a> at the <a href="Canterbury_Cathedral" title="wikilink">cathedral</a>. <a href="British_Royal_Family" title="wikilink">Royalty</a> have entered the city through the gate, including <a href="George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">George VI</a> in 1948.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1453 Henry VI permitted the Mayor and Commonality to keep a jail at the Westgate, so the building was Canterbury's prison from the 15th to the 19th century, while <a href="Canterbury_Castle" title="wikilink">Canterbury Castle</a> was the county jail. After repairs to the Westgate and jail in 1667, a <a href="pound_(village)" title="wikilink">pound</a> was built on the north side; this is now gone, but Pound Lane remains. The guard rooms, heavily wood-lined in the eighteenth century, became cells for both debtors and criminals, and the room over the arch became the condemned cell with the portcullis now laid on top. Until 1775 there was a grated cage in the prison gateway, where certain prisoners were allowed to beg for <a href="alms" class="uri" title="wikilink">alms</a> and speak with passers by. Capital punishment was normally the gallows, plus the stake at <a href="Wincheap" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wincheap</a> for religious martyrs in the time of <a href="Mary_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Queen Mary</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>The present museum was established in 1908, and it currently displays <a href="weapon" title="wikilink">weaponry</a> in the guard chamber between the towers above the road, for three hours on Saturdays. In recent years the towers were also open on Sunday afternoons.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The roof of one of the towers is accessible via a spiral staircase, and from there an extended view of <a href="Canterbury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canterbury</a> is visible from between the <a href="battlement" title="wikilink">battlements</a>.

<p>Since <a href="City_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Canterbury City Council</a> suffered loss of income and presented a <a href="budget" class="uri" title="wikilink">budget</a> to save money in late 2009, the museum has been threatened with closure which would take place on 18 February 2010. Pressure groups including archaeologists and schools have combined to present alternative measures. A meeting was held on 21 January 2009 at which the Council held a preliminary vote to close three museums, including the West Gate Towers Museum. Objections have been made, and the availability of funds from the <a href="National_Lottery_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">National Lottery</a> is being considered for at least one museum.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
