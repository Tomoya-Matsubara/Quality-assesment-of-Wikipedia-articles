<p><strong>Derwent Valley Mills</strong> is a <a href="World_Heritage_Site" title="wikilink">World Heritage Site</a> along the <a href="River_Derwent,_Derbyshire" title="wikilink">River Derwent</a> in <a href="Derbyshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Derbyshire</a>, England, designated in December 2001. The modern <a href="factory" class="uri" title="wikilink">factory</a>, or 'mill', system was born here in the 18th century to accommodate the new technology for spinning <a href="cotton" class="uri" title="wikilink">cotton</a> developed by <a href="Richard_Arkwright" title="wikilink">Richard Arkwright</a>. The system was adopted throughout the valley, and later across the country so that by 1788 over 200 Arkwright type mills in Britain. Arkwright's inventions and system of organising labour was exported to Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>The building of industrial establishments in a <a href="rural" class="uri" title="wikilink">rural</a> landscape meant it was necessary to construct housing for the mill workers. Thus, new villages developed around the mills; these still exist today and can be visited as they form part of the site. A tranport infrastructure was built to open new markets for the mills' produce. The mills went into decline in the mid 19th century as the cotton market moved from Derbyshire to Lancashire. Many of the buildings within the World Heritage Site are also <a href="listed_building" title="wikilink">listed buildings</a> and <a href="Scheduled_Monument" title="wikilink">Scheduled Monuments</a>.</p>
<h2 id="location-and-coverage">Location and coverage</h2>
<p>The World Heritage Site covers an area of <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and spans a  stretch of the Derwent Valley in Derbyshire from <a href="Matlock_Bath" title="wikilink">Matlock Bath</a> in the north to <a href="Derby" title="wikilink">Derby city centre</a> in the south. Within the sites are mill complexes, settlements including workers' housing, <a href="weir" title="wikilink">weirs</a> on the River Derwent, and the transport network that supported the mills in the valley.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The site consists of the communities of <a href="Cromford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cromford</a>, <a href="Belper" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belper</a>, <a href="Milford,_Derbyshire" title="wikilink">Milford</a>, and <a href="Darley_Abbey" title="wikilink">Darley Abbey</a>, and includes 838 <a href="listed_building" title="wikilink">listed buildings</a>, made up of 16 Grade I, 42 Grade II*, and 780 Grade II. A further 9 structures are <a href="Scheduled_Ancient_Monument" title="wikilink">Scheduled Ancient Monuments</a>. The buildings are a mixture of mills, workers' housing, and structures associated with the mill communities. The Cromford Canal and <a href="Cromford_and_High_Peak_Railway" title="wikilink">Cromford and High Peak Railway</a>, which aided the industrialisation of the area, are also part of the World Heritage Site.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><img src="Derby_cotton_mill_2006.jpg" title="fig:Lombe&#39;s silk mill" alt="Lombe&#39;s silk mill" /> In the late 17th century silk making expanded due to demand for silk as part of fashionable garments. In an attempt to increase production through the use of water power, Thomas Cotchett commissioned engineer <a href="George_Sorocold" title="wikilink">George Sorocold</a> to build a mill near the centre of Derby on an island in the River Derwent. Although the experiment was unsuccessful, it convinced <a href="John_Lombe" title="wikilink">John Lombe</a> – an employee of Cotchett – that if water power could be perfected there was a market for its produce. He engaged in industrial espionage and gained plans of Italian machines. He patented the design in 1719 built a five-storey mill  next to Crotchett's mill. By 1763, 30 years after Lombe's patent had expired, only seven Lombe mills had been built because the silk market was small, but Lombe had introduced a viable form of water powered machinery and had established a template for organised labour that later industrialists would follow.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Cromford_1775_mill.jpg" title="fig:The foundations of the 1775 Cromford Mill which was destroyed by fire in 1890, with wheel chamber on the right." alt="The foundations of the 1775 Cromford Mill which was destroyed by fire in 1890, with wheel chamber on the right." width="300" /> In 1771, Richard Arkwright took a lease on land in Cromford. By 1774, his first mill was operational, and in 1776 he began construction of a second mill at Cromford. During this time, he developed machines for pre-spinning and took out patents in 1775. Arkwright sought financial assistance, and Peter Nightingale – a local landowner – bought the Cromford Estate for &lt;U+00A3&gt;20,000 (&lt;U+00A3&gt; as of ).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Nightingale also built Rock House as a residence for Arkwright, overlooking the mill, and gave him a further &lt;U+00A3&gt;2,000 (&lt;U+00A3&gt;) to build the second mill and &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,750 (&lt;U+00A3&gt;) for workers' housing. Between 1777 and 1783, Arkwright and his family built mills at <a href="Bakewell" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bakewell</a>, <a href="Cressbrook" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cressbrook</a>, <a href="Rocester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rocester</a>, and <a href="Wirksworth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wirksworth</a>, spread across Derbyshire and <a href="Staffordshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Staffordshire</a>. <a href="Jedediah_Strutt" title="wikilink">Jedediah Strutt</a>, who was Arkwright's partner in the first Cromford Mill, built mills at Belper and Milford in 1776–1881. Arkwright was paid royalties by those who had copied his machines, although some people risked prosecution by engaging in <a href="Patent_infringement" title="wikilink">piracy</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The construction of Masson Mill in Matlock Bath began in 1783, instigated by Arkwright.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Contemporaneous with Arkwright's expansionism was the entry of Jedediah Strutt into the cotton spinning industry. Strutt had the advantage that Arkwright had already done all the necessary experimentation with machinery, so he did not have to invest in researching new technology. He established a mill at Belper, about  south of Cromford; it was probably complete in 1781. The site was expanded with the addition of a second mill in 1784. Strutt also built a mill in Milford, about  north of Belper. By 1893, two further mills were added for printing and bleaching. The Strutts estimated that by 1789 they had invested &lt;U+00A3&gt;37,000 (&lt;U+00A3&gt;) in theirs mills at Belper and Milford (&lt;U+00A3&gt;26,000 at Belper amd &lt;U+00A3&gt;11,000 at Milford), and had a return of &lt;U+00A3&gt;36,000 (&lt;U+00A3&gt;) per year.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Cromford_workers_cottages.jpg" title="fig:Workers&#39; cottages in Cromford" alt="Workers&#39; cottages in Cromford" /> Arkwright had a reputation as a <a href="paternalism" title="wikilink">paternalistic</a> employer who was concerned for the well-being of his employees and their families. A Sunday School was built at Cromford in 1785 and provided education to 200 children.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> By 1789, the Cromford Estate was back in the ownership of the Arkwrights, who actively influenced its structure and construction. Cromford was given a market place to act as a new focus for the village. Arkwright organised a market every Sunday and as incentive to attend, gave annual prizes to those who attended most often.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> After Arkwright died in 1792 his son, <a href="Richard_Arkwright_junior" title="wikilink">Richard Arkwright junior</a>, took over and sold most of his cotton mills outside Cromford and Matlock Bath. The mills in Cromford and Matlock Bath were probably retained to support the <a href="Willersley_Castle" title="wikilink">Willersley Estate</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Societies and clubs were created in Cromford. The religious affairs of the community were of less interest to Arkwright, and it was not until 1797 that Arkwright junior established Cromford Church; his father had envisaged it as a private <a href="chapel" class="uri" title="wikilink">chapel</a> for the Arkwright family at <a href="Willersley_Castle" title="wikilink">Willersley Castle</a>. The family's attempts to make Cromford self sustaining through establishing a market was successful, and the village expanded until about 1840. This was even though the mills had passed their zenith and begun to enter decline in this period.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Richard Arkwright junior was uninterested in the cotton business, and after the death of his father the Arkwright family ceased to invest in the industry. The Strutt family continued to invest, fuelled by the profits of their mills in Milford and Belper. They continued building mills into the 1810s, and by 1833 their business employed 2,000 people and had dominated the cotton industry in the Derwent Valley.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> As Arkwright had done at Cromford, the Strutts provided housing for their employees. Belper was already an established village with its own market before Jedediah Strutt began building mills, so he was not required to have as active a role in developing the community into a self-sustaining entity as Richard Arkwright did at Cromford.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The Strutts provided education, and in 1817 650 and 300 children attended Sunday Schools in Belper and Milford respectively.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Compared with Cromford, whose population had plateaued at around 1,200 in the early 19th century, the population of Belper rose from 4,500 in 1801 to 7,890 in 1831 due to the prosperity of the business.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite being a major power of the cotton industry in the first quarter of the 19th century, the company began to lose out to competition from Lancashire <a href="mill_town" title="wikilink">mill towns</a>. The problem of shifting markets affected the entire Derwent Valley; Lancashire was better situated than the Derbyshire in relation to the raw materials and new markets.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The mills run by the Strutt family also suffered from a lack of modernisation; although they were at the forefront of fireproofing technology at the start of the 19th century, as the machines the mills used got bigger and more powerful, the Strutts persevered with child labour where adults would have been more adept at using the machinery.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="transport">Transport</h2>
<h3 id="cromford-canal">Cromford canal</h3>

<p><img src="Cromford_Wharf_2008.jpg" title="fig:Cromford Wharf, the terminus of the Cromford Canal" alt="Cromford Wharf, the terminus of the Cromford Canal" /> The <a href="Erewash_Canal" title="wikilink">Erewash Canal</a>, begun in 1777, was intended to primarily transport coal. It flowed from the <a href="River_Trent" title="wikilink">River Trent</a> in <a href="Sawley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sawley</a> to <a href="Langley_Mill" title="wikilink">Langley Mill</a>,  south of Cromford. In 1788, Richard Arkwright asked <a href="William_Jessop" title="wikilink">William Jessop</a> to estimate the cost of building a canal connecting the mills at Cromford to Langley Mill. The figure Jessop came up with was &lt;U+00A3&gt;42,000 (&lt;U+00A3&gt; as of ) which was raised within a couple of weeks. Local mill owners Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans opposed the proposed canal, fearing it would interfere with the water supply for their own mills, but in 1789 Parliament granted permission to construct the canal.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>When the Cromford Canal was opened in 1794, it had cost nearly twice Jessop's original estimate. Between Langley Mill and Cromford Wharf, where the canal terminated in the mill complex, the canal crossed two aqueducts, traversed  of tunnel beneath some ironworks at <a href="Bull_Bridge" title="wikilink">Bull Bridge</a>, and fourteen <a href="Lock_(water_transport)" title="wikilink">locks</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Three quarters of the cargo transported on the canal was coal and coke, while the rest consisted of gritstone, iron ore, and lead.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> When the <a href="Derby_Canal" title="wikilink">Derby</a> and <a href="Nottingham_Canal" title="wikilink">Nottingham Canals</a> were completed by Jessop and <a href="Benjamin_Outram" title="wikilink">Benjamin Outram</a> in 1796, they provided direct routes to the important textile centres of Derby and <a href="Nottingham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nottingham</a>. The canal was successful until the mid 19th century when the <a href="Manchester,_Buxton,_Matlock_and_Midlands_Junction_Railway" title="wikilink">Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway</a> extended its line south of the canal. In 1852, the canal was sold to the railway company which accelerated its decline. By 1889 the canal was mostly used for local traffic. It was eventually closed in 1944 as the cost of maintaining and repairing the canal were too great. <a href="Derbyshire_County_Council" title="wikilink">Derbyshire County Council</a> acquired the canal in 1974 and the Cromford Canal Society undertook the task of restoring it.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="cromford-and-high-peak-railway">Cromford and High Peak Railway</h3>

<p><img src="Chpr_workshop.jpg" title="fig:Workshops and offices at High Peak Junction - the southern terminus and the junction with the former Midland Railway now the Derwent Valley Line" alt="Workshops and offices at High Peak Junction - the southern terminus and the junction with the former Midland Railway now the Derwent Valley Line" /> In the early 19th century, a canal had been proposed to connect the <a href="Peak_Forest_Canal" title="wikilink">Peak Forest Canal</a>, which terminated at <a href="Whaley_Bridge" title="wikilink">Whaley Bridge</a>, with the Cromford Canal, providing a direct route between markets in Lancashire and Derbyshire. However, costs were prohibative and the plan was abandoned. <a href="Josias_Jessop" title="wikilink">Josias Jessop</a>, the son of William Jessop, believed that a <a href="wagonway" class="uri" title="wikilink">wagonway</a> would be much cheaper than a canal.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> On 2 May 1825 an <a href="Act_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Act of Parliament</a> for the onstruction of a railway from Cromford to Whaley Bridge was passed. The proposal – backed by <a href="William_Cavendish,_6th_Duke_of_Devonshire" title="wikilink">William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire</a>, Richard Arkwright junior, and several Manchester bankers – was ambitious; it was expected that steam locomotives would be used on the line, even though the technology was in its infancy and <a href="George_Stephenson" title="wikilink">George Stephenson</a> did not build his revolutionary <em><a href="Stephenson&#39;s_Rocket" title="wikilink">Rocket</a></em> until 1829. The south part of the railway, from Cromford Wharf to <a href="Hurdlow_railway_station" title="wikilink">Hurdlow</a>, south east of <a href="Buxton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buxton</a>, opened on 29 May 1830, and on 6  July 1831 the rest of the line opened to Whaley Bridge.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The first steam locomotive on the line was introduced in 1841; before that, the traffic had been made up entirely of wagons.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The railway ascended from  above sea level at Cromford Wharf to a height of  above sea level at Ladmanlow, before descending to  at the wharves of the Peak Forest Canal. The changes in height, which would have necessitated many locks for a canal, was relatively easy for a railway. However, for a time the Comford and High Peak Railway did have the sharpest curve out of all railways in Britain and the steepest incline for vehicles without steam power.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The construction of the railway cost was &lt;U+00A3&gt;180,000, higher than the original estimate of &lt;U+00A3&gt;155,000 (&lt;U+00A3&gt; and &lt;U+00A3&gt; respectively as of ) but much lower than the &lt;U+00A3&gt;500,000 the canal was predicted to cost (&lt;U+00A3&gt; as of ).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Having been built to connect the Peak Forset and Cromford Canals, the railways fortunes were closely tied with those of the canals. The line was not profitable as by the time it had opened traffic had declined along the Cromford Canal.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In 1855, an Act of Parliament allowed the line to transport passengers as well as freight.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Although passenger travel became more important to the railway, it went into decline and closed on 21 April 1967.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

The reason a settlement was built contemporaneously with Cromford Mill was to provide housing for the workers; the only way to secure the labour the mill required was if homes were provided for the labourers and their families. The success of Arkwright's model lead to other industrialists copying him. Entrepreneurs such as Peter Nightingale, Jedediah Strutt and <a href="Sir_Thomas_William_Evans,_1st_Baronet" title="wikilink">Thomas Evans</a> founded the settlements of <a href="Belper" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belper</a>, <a href="Milford,_Derbyshire" title="wikilink">Milford</a>, and <a href="Darley_Abbey" title="wikilink">Darley Abbey</a> within the Derwent Valley for their employees. As well as the economic standpoint of ensuring a supply of labour, the industrialists were also concerned for their employees and families and acted out of a sense of <a href="paternalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">paternalism</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Arkwright's innovations were not confined to developing workers' settlements; he also had patents on many technologies used for water-powered spinning. They were so successful that rival industrialists risked legal action by copying his designs. His patents expired in 1785, and by 1788 over 200 Arkwright type mills had been founded in Britain.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1774, the British government passed an acted outlawing the export of &quot;tools or utensils&quot; used in the cotton and linen industries. As a result, the only way for the new technologies being developed in Britain to spread to other countries was through <a href="industrial_espionage" title="wikilink">industrial espionage</a>. Carl Delius worked in England and gave plans for many of Arkwright's inventions to <a href="Johann_Gottfried_Brugelmann" title="wikilink">Johann Gottfried Brugelmann</a>; Brugelmann used the information to establish a mill in <a href="Ratingen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ratingen</a>, near <a href="D&lt;U+00FC&gt;sseldorf" class="uri" title="wikilink">D&lt;U+00FC&gt;sseldorf</a>, which began production in 1784. He named the settlement associated with the mill Cromford. The mill was the first Arkwright mill in mainland Europe.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The techniques for spinning cotton developed in the Derwent Valley were also spread to America. In 1790, the United States had less than 2,000 spindles which were powered by <a href="spinning_jenny" title="wikilink">spinning jennys</a>, compared to 2.4 million machine driven spindles in Britain at the same time. The Arkwright mill was introduced to America by unskilled migrants from England such as <a href="Samuel_Slater" title="wikilink">Samuel Slater</a> who was from the Derwent Valley and founded <a href="Slater_Mill_Historic_Site" title="wikilink">Slater Mill</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
