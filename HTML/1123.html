<p><strong>William Edward Burghardt Du Bois</strong> (pronounced , ; February 23, 1868 &lt;U+2013&gt; August 27, 1963) was an American <a href="sociologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">sociologist</a>, <a href="historian" class="uri" title="wikilink">historian</a>, <a href="civil_rights_activist" title="wikilink">civil rights activist</a>, <a href="Pan-Africanism" title="wikilink">Pan-Africanist</a>, author, and editor. Born in western Massachusetts, Du Bois grew up in a tolerant community and experienced little racism as a child. After graduating from <a href="Harvard" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harvard</a>, where he was the first <a href="African_American" title="wikilink">African American</a> to earn a doctorate, he became a professor of history, sociology, and economics at <a href="Atlanta_University" title="wikilink">Atlanta University</a>. Du Bois was one of the co-founders of the <a href="National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People" title="wikilink">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP) in 1909.</p>
<p>Du Bois rose to national prominence as the leader of the <a href="Niagara_Movement" title="wikilink">Niagara Movement</a>, a group of African American activists who wanted equal rights for blacks. Du Bois and his supporters opposed the <a href="Atlanta_Compromise" title="wikilink">Atlanta Compromise</a>, an agreement crafted by <a href="Booker_T._Washington" title="wikilink">Booker T. Washington</a> which provided that Southern blacks would work and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic educational and economic opportunities. Instead, Du Bois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation, which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite. He referred to this group as the <em><a href="Talented_Tenth" title="wikilink">talented tenth</a></em> and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership.</p>
<p>Racism was the main target of Du Bois's polemics, and he strongly protested against lynching, <a href="Jim_Crow" title="wikilink">Jim Crow</a> laws, and <a href="discrimination" class="uri" title="wikilink">discrimination</a> in education and employment. His cause included colored persons everywhere, particularly Africans and Asians in their struggles against <a href="colonialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">colonialism</a> and <a href="imperialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">imperialism</a>. He was a proponent of Pan-Africanism and helped organized several <a href="Pan-African_Congress" title="wikilink">Pan-African Congresses</a> to free African colonies from European powers. Du Bois made several trips to each of Europe, Africa, and Asia. After World War I, he surveyed the experiences of American black soldiers in France and documented widespread bigotry in the United States military.</p>
<p>Du Bois was a prolific author. His collection of essays, <em><a href="The_Souls_of_Black_Folk" title="wikilink">The Souls of Black Folk</a></em>, was a seminal work in <a href="African-American_literature" title="wikilink">African-American literature</a>; and his 1935 magnum opus <em><a href="Black_Reconstruction_in_America" title="wikilink">Black Reconstruction in America</a></em> challenged the prevailing orthodoxy that blacks were responsible for the failures of the <a href="Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Reconstruction</a> era. He wrote the first scientific treatise in the field of sociology; and he published three autobiographies, each of which contain insightful essays on sociology, politics, and history. In his role as editor of the NAACP's journal <em><a href="The_Crisis" title="wikilink">The Crisis</a></em>, he published many influential pieces. Du Bois believed that capitalism was a primary cause of racism, and he was generally sympathetic to socialist causes throughout his life. He was an ardent peace activist and advocated for <a href="nuclear_disarmament" title="wikilink">nuclear disarmament</a>. The United States' <a href="Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964" title="wikilink">Civil Rights Act</a>, embodying many of the reforms for which Du Bois had campaigned his entire life, was enacted one year after his death.</p>

The Burghardt family descended from <a href="Dutch_(ethnic_group)" title="wikilink">Dutch</a>, <a href="Africa" title="wikilink">African</a> and English ancestors.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> William Du Bois's maternal great-grandfather was Tom Burghardt, a slave (born in <a href="West_Africa" title="wikilink">West Africa</a> around 1730) who was held by the Dutch colonist Conraed Burghardt. Tom briefly served in the <a href="Continental_Army" title="wikilink">Continental Army</a> during the <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">American Revolutionary War</a>, which may have been how he gained his freedom.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Tom's son Jack Burghardt was the father of <a href="Othello" class="uri" title="wikilink">Othello</a> Burghardt, who was the father of Mary Silvina Burghardt.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>William Du Bois's paternal great-grandfather was an ethnic French-American, James Du Bois of <a href="Poughkeepsie_(city),_New_York" title="wikilink">Poughkeepsie, New York</a>, who fathered several children with <a href="slave" class="uri" title="wikilink">slave</a> mistresses.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> One of James' <a href="mixed-race" class="uri" title="wikilink">mixed-race</a> sons was Alexander, who traveled to Haiti, and fathered a son, Alfred, with a mistress there. Alexander returned to Connecticut, leaving Alfred in Haiti with his mother.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Alfred moved to the United States sometime before 1860, and married Mary Silvina Burghardt on February 5, 1867 in <a href="Housatonic,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Housatonic, Massachusetts</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Alfred left Mary in 1870, two years after William was born.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> William's mother worked to support her family (receiving some assistance from her brother and neighbors), until she experienced a stroke in the early 1880s. She died in 1885.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Great Barrington's primarily <a href="European_American" title="wikilink">European American</a> community treated Du Bois well, and he knew little discrimination. He attended the local public school and played with white schoolmates. Teachers encouraged his intellectual pursuits, and his rewarding experience with academic studies led him to believe that he could use his knowledge to empower <a href="African_Americans" title="wikilink">African Americans</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> When Du Bois decided to attend college, the congregation of his childhood church, the <a href="First_Congregational_Church_of_Great_Barrington" title="wikilink">First Congregational Church of Great Barrington</a>, donated money for his tuition.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

In 1890, Harvard awarded Du Bois his second bachelor's degree, <em><a href="Latin_honors" title="wikilink">cum laude</a></em>, in history.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In 1891, Du Bois received a scholarship to attend the sociology graduate school at Harvard.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1892, Du Bois received a fellowship from the <a href="Slater_Fund" title="wikilink">John F.

<h3 id="wilberforce-and-university-of-pennsylvania">Wilberforce and University of Pennsylvania</h3>

<p>In the summer of 1894, Du Bois received several job offers, including one from the prestigious <a href="Tuskegee_Institute" title="wikilink">Tuskegee Institute</a>; he accepted a teaching job at <a href="Wilberforce_University" title="wikilink">Wilberforce University</a> in Ohio.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> At Wilberforce, Du Bois was strongly influenced by <a href="Alexander_Crummell" title="wikilink">Alexander Crummell</a>, who believed that ideas and morals are necessary tools to effect social change.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> While at Wilberforce, Du Bois married Nina Gomer, one of his students, on May 12, 1896.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>After two years at Wilberforce, Du Bois accepted a one-year research job from the <a href="University_of_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">University of Pennsylvania</a> as an &quot;assistant in sociology&quot; in the summer of 1896.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He performed sociological field research in Philadelphia's African-American neighborhoods, which formed the foundation for his landmark study, <em><a href="The_Philadelphia_Negro" title="wikilink">The Philadelphia Negro</a>,</em> published two years later. It was the first case study of a black community. By its publication, he was teaching at <a href="Atlanta_University" title="wikilink">Atlanta University</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>While attending the <a href="Negro_Academy" title="wikilink">Negro Academy</a> in 1897, Du Bois presented a paper in which he rejected <a href="Frederick_Douglass" title="wikilink">Frederick Douglass</a>' plea for black Americans to integrate into white society. He wrote: &quot;... we are Negroes, members of a vast historic race that from the very dawn of creation has slept, but half awakening in the dark forests of its African fatherland&quot;.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In the August 1897 issue of <em><a href="Atlantic_Monthly" title="wikilink">Atlantic Monthly</a></em>, Du Bois published &quot;Strivings of the Negro People&quot;, his first work aimed at the general public, in which he enlarged on his thesis that African Americans should embrace their African heritage.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="atlanta-university">Atlanta University</h2>
<p>In July 1897, Du Bois left Philadelphia and took a professorship in history and economics at the historically black Atlanta University.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> His first major academic accomplishment was the 1899 publication of <em>The Philadelphia Negro</em>, a detailed and comprehensive sociological study of the African-American people of Philadelphia, based on the field work he did in 1896&lt;U+2013&gt;1897. The work was a breakthrough in scholarship, because it was the first scientific sociological study in the U.S., and the first scientific study of African Americans.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In the study, Du Bois coined the phrase &quot;the submerged tenth&quot; to describe the black underclass, anticipating the &quot;<a href="The_Talented_Tenth" title="wikilink">talented tenth</a>&quot; term he would popularize in 1903 to describe society's elite class.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Du Bois's terminology reflected his opinion that the elite of a nation, black and white, was the critical portion of society that was responsible for culture and progress.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Du Bois's writings of this era were often dismissive of the underclass, employing characterizations such as &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;unreliable&quot;, but he &lt;U+2013&gt; in contrast to other scholars &lt;U+2013&gt; attributed many societal problems to the ravages of slavery.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Du Bois's output at Atlanta University was prodigious, in spite of a limited budget: He produced numerous social science papers and annually hosted the <a href="Atlanta_Conference_of_Negro_Problems" title="wikilink">Atlanta Conference of Negro Problems</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Du Bois also received grants from the U.S. government to prepare reports about African-American workforce and culture.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> His students considered him to be a brilliant, but aloof and strict, teacher.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="WEB_Du_Bois.jpg" title="fig:W. E. B. Du Bois in 1904" alt="W. E. B. Du Bois in 1904" /> In the first decade of the new century, Du Bois emerged as a spokesperson for his race, second only to <a href="Booker_T._Washington" title="wikilink">Booker T. Washington</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Washington was the director of the Tuskegee Institute, and wielded tremendous influence within the African-American community.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Washington was the architect of the <a href="Atlanta_Compromise" title="wikilink">Atlanta Compromise</a>, an unwritten deal he struck in 1895 with Southern white leaders who had taken over government after the failure of Reconstruction. The agreement provided that Southern blacks would submit to discrimination, segregation, lack of voting rights, and non-unionized employment; that Southern whites would permit blacks to receive a basic education, some economic opportunities, and justice within the legal system; and that Northern whites would invest in Southern enterprises and fund black educational charities.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Many African Americans opposed Washington's plan, including DuBois, <a href="Archibald_H._Grimke" title="wikilink">Archibald H.

<p>Du Bois was inspired to greater activism by the <a href="lynching" class="uri" title="wikilink">lynching</a> of <a href="Sam_Hose" title="wikilink">Sam Hose</a>, which occurred near Atlanta in 1899.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Hose was tortured, burned, and hung by a mob of two thousand whites.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> When walking through Atlanta to discuss the lynching with a newspaper editor, Du Bois encountered Hose's burned knuckles in a storefront display.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The episode numbed Du Bois, and he resolved that &quot;one could not be a calm cool, and detached scientist while Negroes were lynched, murdered, and starved.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Du Bois realized that &quot;the cure wasn't simply telling people the truth, it was inducing them to act on the truth.&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1901, Du Bois wrote a review critical of Washington's book <em><a href="Up_from_Slavery" title="wikilink">Up from Slavery</a></em>,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> which he later expanded and published to a wider audience as the essay &quot;Of Mr. Booker T.

<h3 id="racial-violence">Racial violence</h3>
<p>Two calamities in the autumn of 1906 shocked African Americans, and helped Du Bois's struggle for civil rights to prevail over Booker T. Washington's <a href="Atlanta_Compromise" title="wikilink">accommodationism</a>. First, President <a href="Teddy_Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Teddy Roosevelt</a> dishonorably discharged 167 black soldiers because they were accused of crimes as a result of the <a href="Brownsville_Affair" title="wikilink">Brownsville Affair</a>.

<p>Du Bois wrote an essay &quot;A Litany at Atlanta&quot; which asserted that the riot demonstrated that the Atlanta Compromise was a failure because, despite upholding their end of the bargain, blacks had failed to receive legal justice.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> The Compromise was no longer effective because, according to historian David Lewis, white patrician plantation owners that originally agreed to the compromise had been replaced by aggressive businessmen who were willing to pit blacks against whites.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> These two calamities were watershed events for the African-American community, and marked the downfall of Washington's Atlanta Compromise and the ascendancy of Du Bois's vision of equal rights.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>In addition to writing editorials, Du Bois continued to produce scholarly work at Atlanta University. In 1909, after five years of effort, he published a biography of John Brown. It contained many insights, but also contained some factual errors.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The work was strongly criticized by <em><a href="The_Nation" title="wikilink">The Nation</a></em>, which was owned by <a href="Oswald_Villard" title="wikilink">Oswald Villard</a>, an author who was writing a competing biography of John Brown.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Du Bois's work was largely ignored by white scholars.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> After he published a piece in <em><a href="Collier&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Collier's</a></em> magazine warning of the end of &quot;white supremacy&quot;, he had difficulty getting pieces accepted by major periodicals; however, he continued to publish columns regularly in the <em>The Horizon</em> magazine.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a>  Du Bois was the first African American invited by the <a href="American_Historical_Association" title="wikilink">American Historical Association</a> (AHA) to present a paper at their annual conference.

<p><img src="Motto_web_dubois_original.jpg" title="fig:Du Bois c. 1911" alt="Du Bois c. 1911" /> NAACP leaders offered Du Bois the position of Director of Publicity and Research.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> He accepted the job in the summer of 1910, and moved to New York after resigning from Atlanta University.

<p>An important Du Bois editorial from 1911 helped initiate a nationwide push to induce the Federal government to outlaw lynching. Du Bois, employing the sarcasm he frequently used, commented on a lynching in Pennsylvania: &quot;The point is he was black. Blackness must be punished. Blackness is the crime of crimes ... It is therefore necessary, as every white scoundrel in the nation knows, to let slip no opportunity of punishing this crime of crimes. Of course if possible, the pretext should be great and overwhelming &lt;U+2013&gt; some awful stunning crime, made even more horrible by the reporters' imagination. Failing this, mere murder, arson, barn burning or impudence may do.&quot;<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p><em>The Crisis</em> carried editorials by Du Bois that supported the ideals of unionized labor, but excoriated the racism demonstrated by its leaders, who systematically excluded blacks from membership.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Du Bois also supported the principles of the Socialist party (he was briefly a member of the party from 1910&lt;U+2013&gt;12), but he denounced the racism demonstrated by some socialist leaders.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Frustrated by Republican president Taft's failure to address widespread lynching, Du Bois endorsed Democratic candidate <a href="Woodrow_Wilson" title="wikilink">Woodrow Wilson</a> in the 1912 presidential race, in exchange for Wilson's promise to support black causes.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>Throughout his writings, Du Bois supported women's rights,<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> but he found it difficult to publicly endorse the <a href="Women&#39;s_suffrage_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">women's right-to-vote movement</a> because leaders of the <a href="suffragism" class="uri" title="wikilink">suffragism</a> movement refused to support his fight against racial injustice.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> A <em>Crisis</em> editorial from 1913 broached the taboo subject of <a href="interracial_marriage" title="wikilink">interracial marriage</a>: Although Du Bois generally expected persons to marry within their race, he viewed the problem as a women's rights issue, because laws prohibited white men from marrying black women. Du Bois wrote &quot;[[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|[anti-miscegenation] laws]] leave the colored girls absolutely helpless for the lust of white men. It reduces colored women in the eyes of the law to the position of dogs. As low as the white girl falls, she can compel her seducer to marry her ...

<p>During the years 1915 and 1916, some leaders of the NAACP &lt;U+2013&gt; disturbed by financial losses at <em>The Crisis</em>, and worried about the inflammatory rhetoric of some of its essays &lt;U+2013&gt; attempted to oust Du Bois from his editorial position.

<p>The 1910s were a productive time for Du Bois. In 1911 he attended the <a href="First_Universal_Races_Congress" title="wikilink">First Universal Races Congress</a> in London<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> and he published his first novel, <em>The Quest of the Silver Fleece.</em><a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Two years later, Du Bois wrote, produced, and directed a pageant for the stage, <em><a href="The_Star_of_Ethiopia" title="wikilink">The Star of Ethiopia</a></em>.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> In 1915, Du Bois published <em><a href="The_Negro" title="wikilink">The Negro</a></em>, a general history of black Africans, and the first of its kind in English.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> The book rebutted claims of African inferiority, and would come to serve as the basis of much Afrocentric historiography in the 20th century.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> <em>The Negro</em> predicted unity and solidarity for colored people around the world, and it influenced many who supported the Pan-African movement.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1915, <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> carried an essay by Du Bois, &quot;The African Roots of the War&quot;, which consolidated Du Bois's ideas on capitalism and race.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> In it, he argued that the <a href="scramble_for_Africa" title="wikilink">scramble for Africa</a> was at the root of the World War I. He also anticipated later Communist doctrine, by suggesting that wealthy capitalists had pacified white workers, by giving them just enough wealth to prevent them from revolting, and by threatening them with competition by lower-cost labor of colored workers.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>

When the silent film <em><a href="The_Birth_of_a_Nation" title="wikilink">The Birth of a Nation</a></em> premiered in 1915, Du Bois and the NAACP led the fight to ban the movie, because of its racist portrayal of blacks as brutish and lustful.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> The fight was not successful, and possibly contributed to the film's fame, but the publicity drew many new supporters to the NAACP.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p>The private sector was not the only source of racism, under President Wilson the plight of African Americans in government jobs suffered. Many federal agencies adopted white-only employment practices, the Army excluded blacks from officer ranks, and the immigration service prohibited the immigration of persons of African ancestry.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Du Bois wrote an editorial in 1914 deploring the dismissal of blacks from federal posts, and he supported William Monroe Trotter when Trotter brusquely confronted Wilson about Wilson's failure to fulfill his campaign promise of justice for blacks.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p><em>The Crisis</em> continued to wage a campaign against lynching. In 1915 it published an article with a year-by-year tabulation of 2,732 lynchings from 1884 to 1914.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> The April 1916 edition covered the group lynching of six African Americans in Lee County, Georgia.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Later in 1916, the &quot;Waco Horror&quot; article covering the <a href="Lynching_of_Jesse_Washington" title="wikilink">lynching of Jesse Washington</a>, a mentally impaired 17-year-old African American.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> The article broke new ground by utilizing undercover reporting to expose the conduct of local whites in Waco.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<p>The early twentieth century was the era of the <a href="Great_Migration_(African_American)" title="wikilink">Great Migration</a> of blacks from the Southern United States to the Northeast, Midwest, and West. Du Bois wrote an editorial supporting the Great Migration of blacks from the Southern United States to the Northeast, Midwest, and West, because he felt it would help blacks escape Southern racism, find economic opportunities, and assimilate into American society.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="world-war-i">World War I</h3>
<p>As the United States prepared to enter <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> in 1917, Du Bois's colleague in the NAACP, <a href="Joel_Spingarn" title="wikilink">Joel Spingarn</a>, established a camp to train African Americans to serve as officers in the United States military.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> The camp was controversial, because some whites felt that blacks were not qualified to be officers, and some blacks felt that African Americans should not participate in what they considered a white man's war.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Du Bois supported Spingarn's training camp, but was disappointed when the Army forcibly retired one of its few black officers, <a href="Charles_Young_(United_States_Army)" title="wikilink">Charles Young</a>, on a pretense of ill health.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> The Army agreed to create 1,000 officer positions for blacks, but insisted that 250 come from enlisted men, conditioned to taking orders from whites, rather than from independent-minded blacks that came from the camp.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Over 700,000 blacks enlisted on the first day of the draft, but were subject to discriminatory conditions which prompted vocal protests from Du Bois.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> <img src="1917_Silent_Parade_men_H.tiff" title="fig:Du Bois organized the 1917 Silent Parade in New York, to protest the East St. Louis Riot" alt="Du Bois organized the 1917 Silent Parade in New York, to protest the East St. Louis Riot" width="300" /> After the <a href="East_St._Louis_Riot" title="wikilink">East St. Louis Riot</a> occurred in the summer of 1917, Du Bois traveled to St. Louis to report on the riots. Between 40 and 250 African Americans were massacred by whites, primarily due to resentment caused by St. Louis industry hiring blacks to replace striking white workers.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> Du Bois's reporting resulted in an article &quot;The Massacre of East St. Louis&quot;, published in the September issue of <em>The Crisis</em>, which contained photographs and interviews detailing the violence.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> Historian <a href="David_Levering_Lewis" title="wikilink">David Levering Lewis</a> concluded that Du Bois distorted some of the facts in order to increase the propaganda value of the article.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> To publicly demonstrate the black community's outrage over the St Louis riot, Du Bois organized the <a href="Silent_Parade" title="wikilink">Silent Parade</a>, a march of around 9,000 African Americans down New York's Fifth avenue, the first parade of its kind in New York, and the second instance of blacks publicly demonstrating for civil rights.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Houston_Riot_(1917)" title="wikilink">Houston Riot</a> of 1917 disturbed Du Bois and was a major setback to efforts to permit African Americans to become military officers. The riot began after Houston police arrested and beat two black soldiers; in response, over 100 black soldiers took to the streets of Houston and killed 16 whites. A military court martial was held, and 19 of the soldiers were hung, and 67 others were imprisoned.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> In spite of the Houston Riot, Du Bois and others successfully pressed the Army to accept the officers trained at Spingarn's camp, resulting in over 600 black officers joining the Army in October 1917.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<p>Federal officials, concerned about subversive viewpoints expressed by NAACP leaders, attempted to frighten the NAACP by threatening it with investigations.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> Du Bois was not intimidated, and in 1918 he predicted that World War I would lead to an overthrow of the European colonial system and to the liberation of colored people world-wide &lt;U+2013&gt; in China, in India, and especially in America.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> NAACP chairman Joel Spingarn was enthusiastic about the war, and he persuaded Du Bois to consider an officer's commission in the Army, contingent on Du Bois writing an editorial repudiating his anti-war stance.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> Du Bois accepted this bargain and wrote the pro-war &quot;Close Ranks&quot; editorial in June 1918<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> and soon thereafter he received a commission in the Army.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> Many black leaders, who wanted to leverage the war to gain civil rights for African Americans, criticized Du Bois for his sudden reversal.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> Southern officers in Du Bois's unit objected to his presence, and his commission was withdrawn.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>

<p>Du Bois wrote a series of articles in <em>The Crisis</em> between 1922 and 1924, attacking Garvey's movement, calling him the &quot;most dangerous enemy of the Negro race in America and the world.&quot;<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> Du Bois and Garvey never made a serious attempt to collaborate, and their dispute was partly rooted in the desire of their respective organizations (NAACP and UNIA) to capture a larger portion of the available philanthropic funding.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>
<p>Harvard's decision to ban blacks from its dormitories in 1921 was decried by Du Bois as an instance of a broad effort in the U.S. to renew &quot;the Anglo-Saxon cult; the worship of the Nordic totem, the disfranchisement of the Negro, Jews, Irishman, Italian, Hungarian, Asiate, and South Sea islander &lt;U+2013&gt; the world rule of Nordic white through brute force.&quot;<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> When Du Bois sailed for Europe in 1923 for the third Pan-African Congress, the circulation of <em>The Crisis</em> had declined to 60,000 from its World War I high of 100,000, but it remained the preeminent periodical of the civil rights movement.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> <a href="Calvin_Coolidge" title="wikilink">President Coolidge</a> designated Du Bois an &quot;Envoy Extraordinary&quot; to Liberia<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> and &lt;U+2013&gt; after the third congress concluded &lt;U+2013&gt; Du Bois rode a German freighter from the Canary Islands to Africa, visiting <a href="Liberia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liberia</a>, <a href="Sierra_Leone" title="wikilink">Sierra Leone</a> and <a href="Senegal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Senegal</a>.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="harlem-renaissance">Harlem Renaissance</h3>
<p>Du Bois frequently promoted African-American artistic creativity in his writings, and when the <a href="Harlem_Renaissance" title="wikilink">Harlem Renaissance</a> emerged in the mid 1920s, his article &quot;A Negro Art Renaissance&quot; celebrated the end of the long hiatus of blacks from creative endeavors.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> His enthusiasm for the Harlem Renaissance waned as he came to believe that many whites visited Harlem for voyeurism, not for genuine appreciation of black art.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> Du Bois insisted that artists recognize their moral responsibilities, writing that &quot;a black artist is first of all a <em>black</em> artist.&quot;<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> He was also concerned that black artists were not using their art to promote black causes, saying &quot;I do not care a damn for any art that is not used for propaganda.&quot;<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> By the end of 1926, he stopped employing <em>The Crisis</em> to support the arts.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="socialism">Socialism</h3>

<p>Nine years after the 1917 <a href="Russian_Revolution" title="wikilink">Russian Revolution</a>, Du Bois extended a trip to Europe to include a visit to the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> Du Bois was struck by the poverty and disorganization he encountered in the Soviet Union, yet was impressed by the intense labors of the officials and by the recognition given to workers.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> Although Du Bois was not yet familiar with the communist theories of <a href="Marx" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marx</a> or <a href="Lenin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lenin</a>, he concluded that socialism may be a better path towards racial equality than capitalism.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a></p>
<p>Although Du Bois generally endorsed socialist principles, his politics were strictly pragmatic: In 1929, Du Bois endorsed Democrat <a href="Jimmy_Walker" title="wikilink">Jimmy Walker</a> for mayor of New York, rather than the socialist <a href="Norman_Thomas" title="wikilink">Norman Thomas</a>, believing that Walker could do more immediate good for blacks, even though Thomas' platform was more consistent with Du Bois's views.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> Throughout the 1920s, Du Bois and the NAACP shifted support back and forth between the Republican party and the Democratic party, induced by promises from the candidates to fight lynchings, improve working conditions, or support voting rights in the South; invariably, the candidates failed to deliver on their promises.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a></p>
<p>A rivalry emerged in 1931 between the NAACP and the <a href="Communist_Party_USA" title="wikilink">Communist party</a>, when the Communist party responded quickly and effectively to support the <a href="Scottsboro_Boys" title="wikilink">Scottsboro Boys</a>, nine African-American youth arrested in 1931 in Alabama for rape.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> Du Bois and the NAACP felt that the case would be not particularly beneficial to their cause, so they chose to let the Communist party <a href="Scottsboro_Boys#Help_from_Communist_party_and_NAACP" title="wikilink">organize the defense efforts</a>.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> Du Bois was impressed with the vast amount of publicity and funds the Communists devoted to the partially successful defense effort, and he came to suspect that the Communists were attempting to present their party to African Americans as a better solution than the NAACP.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> Responding to criticisms of the NAACP from the Communist party, Du Bois wrote articles condemning the party, claiming that it unfairly attacked the NAACP, and that it failed to fully appreciate racism in the United States.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> The Communist leaders, in turn, accused Du Bois of being a &quot;class enemy&quot;, and claimed that the NAACP leadership was an isolated elite, disconnected from the working-class blacks they ostensibly fought for.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="return-to-atlanta">Return to Atlanta</h2>
<p>Du Bois did not have a good working relationship with <a href="Walter_Francis_White" title="wikilink">Walter Francis White</a>, president of the NAACP since 1931.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> That conflict, combined with the financial stresses of the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a>, precipitated a power struggle over <em>The Crisis</em>.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> Du Bois, concerned that his position as editor would be eliminated, resigned his job at <em>The Crisis</em> and accepted an academic position at Atlanta University in early 1933.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> The rift with the NAACP grew larger in 1934 when Du Bois reversed his stance on segregation, stating that separate but equal was an acceptable goal for African Americans.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> The NAACP leadership was stunned, and asked Du Bois to retract his statement, but he refused, and the dispute led to Du Bois's resignation from the NAACP.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a></p>
<p>After arriving at his new professorship in Atlanta, Du Bois wrote a series of articles generally supportive of Marxism. He was not a strong proponent of labor unions or the Communist party, but he felt that Marx's scientific explanation of society and the economy were useful for explaining the situation of African Americans in the United States.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> Marx's atheism also struck a chord with Du Bois, who routinely criticized black churches for dulling blacks' sensitivity to racism.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> In his 1933 writings, Du Bois embraced socialism, but asserted that &quot;[c]olored labor has no common ground with white labor&quot;, a controversial position that was rooted in Du Bois's dislike of American labor unions, which had systematically excluded blacks for decades.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> Du Bois did not support the Communist party in the U.S. and did not vote for their candidate in the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1932" title="wikilink">1932 presidential election</a>, in spite of an African American on their <a href="Ticket_(election)" title="wikilink">ticket</a>.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="black-reconstruction-in-america"><em>Black Reconstruction in America</em></h3>

<p>Back in the world of academia, Du Bois was able to resume his study of Reconstruction, the topic of the 1910 paper that he presented to the American Historical Association.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> In 1935, he published his magnum opus, <em>Black Reconstruction in America</em>.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> The book presented the thesis, in the words of the historian David Levering Lewis, that &quot;black people, suddenly admitted to citizenship in an environment of feral hostility, displayed admirable volition and intelligence as well as the indolence and ignorance inherent in three centuries of bondage.&quot;<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> Du Bois documented how black people were central figures in the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a> and <a href="Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Reconstruction</a>, and also showed how they made alliances with white politicians. He provided evidence to show that the coalition governments established public education in the South, as well as many needed social service programs. The book also demonstrated the ways in which <a href="Emancipation_Proclamation" title="wikilink">black emancipation</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; the crux of Reconstruction &lt;U+2013&gt; promoted a radical restructuring of United States society, as well as how and why the country failed to continue support for <a href="civil_rights" title="wikilink">civil rights</a> for blacks in the aftermath of Reconstruction.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> The book's thesis ran counter to the <a href="Dunning_School" title="wikilink">orthodox interpretation of Reconstruction</a> maintained by white historians, and the book was virtually ignored by mainstream historians until the 1960s.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1932, Du Bois was selected by several philanthropies &lt;U+2013&gt; including the <a href="Phelps-Stokes_Fund" title="wikilink">Phelps-Stokes Fund</a>, the <a href="Carnegie_Corporation" title="wikilink">Carnegie Corporation</a>, and the <a href="General_Education_Board" title="wikilink">General Education Board</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; to be the managing editor for a proposed <em>Encyclopedia of the Negro</em>, a work Du Bois had been contemplating for 30 years.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> After several years of planning and organizing, the philanthropies cancelled the project in 1938, because some board members believed that Du Bois was too biased to produce an objective encyclopedia.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="trip-around-the-world">Trip around the world</h3>
<p>Du Bois took a trip around the world in 1936, which included visits to <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi Germany</a>, China, and Japan.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> While in Germany, Du Bois remarked that he was treated with warmth and respect,<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> but on his return to the United States, he voiced his ambivalence about the Nazi regime.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> He admired how the Nazis had improved the <a href="The_Great_Depression_in_Germany" title="wikilink">German economy</a>, but he was horrified by their <a href="Nuremberg_Laws" title="wikilink">treatment</a> of the <a href="Jewish_people" title="wikilink">Jewish people</a>, which he described as &quot;an attack on civilization, comparable only to such horrors as the Spanish Inquisition and the African slave trade.&quot;<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the 1905 Japanese victory in the <a href="Russo-Japanese_War" title="wikilink">Russo-Japanese War</a>, Du Bois became impressed by the growing strength of <a href="Empire_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Imperial Japan</a>. He saw the victory of Japan over <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Tsarist Russia</a> as an example of colored peoples defeating white peoples.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> A representative of Japan's &quot;Negro Propaganda Operations&quot; traveled to the United States during the 1920s and 1930s, meeting with Du Bois and giving him a positive impression of Imperial Japan's racial policies.

<h3 id="world-war-ii">World War II</h3>
<p>Du Bois opposed the U.S. intervention in <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, particularly in the Pacific, because he believed that China and Japan were emerging from the clutches of white imperialists, and he felt that waging war against Japan was an opportunity for whites to reestablish their influence in Asia.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> The government's plan for African Americans in the armed forces was a major blow to Du Bois: Blacks were limited to 5.8 percent of the force, and there were to be no African-American combat units &lt;U+2013&gt; virtually the same restrictions as in World War I.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a> Blacks threatened to shift their support to President <a href="FDR" title="wikilink">Franklin Roosevelt's</a> opponent in the 1940 election, so Roosevelt appointed a few blacks to leadership posts in the military.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> <em><a href="Dusk_of_Dawn" title="wikilink">Dusk of Dawn</a></em>, Du Bois's second autobiography, was published in 1940.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> The title refers to Du Bois's hope that African Americans were passing out of the darkness of racism into an era of greater equality.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> The work is part autobiography, part history, and part sociological treatise.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a> Du Bois described the book as &quot;the autobiography of a concept of race ... elucidated and magnified and doubtless distorted in the thoughts and deeds which were mine ...

<p>The <a href="FBI" class="uri" title="wikilink">FBI</a> began to compile a file on Du Bois in 1942,<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> but the most aggressive government attack against Du Bois occurred in the early 1950s, as a consequence of Du Bois's opposition to nuclear weapons. In 1950 Du Bois became chairman of the newly created <a href="Peace_Information_Center" title="wikilink">Peace Information Center</a> (PIC), which worked to publicize the <a href="Stockholm_Peace_Appeal" title="wikilink">Stockholm Peace Appeal</a> in the United States.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a> The primary purpose of the appeal was to gather signatures on a petition, asking governments around the world to ban all nuclear weapons.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a> The U.S. Justice department alleged that the PIC was acting as an agent of a foreign state, and thus required the PIC to register with the federal government.<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> Du Bois and other PIC leaders refused, and they were indicted for failure to register.<a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a> After the indictment, some of Du Bois's associates distanced themselves from him, and the NAACP refused to issue a statement of support; but many labor figures and leftists &lt;U+2013&gt; including <a href="Langston_Hughes" title="wikilink">Langston Hughes</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; supported Du Bois.<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a> After a trial in 1951, with defense attorney <a href="Vito_Marcantonio" title="wikilink">Vito Marcantonio</a> arguing the case, the case was dismissed.<a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> Even though Du Bois was not convicted, the government confiscated Du Bois's passport and withheld it for eight years.<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="communism">Communism</h3>
<p>Du Bois was bitterly disappointed that many of his colleaguesparticularly the NAACPdid not support him during his 1951 PIC trial, whereas working class whites and blacks supported him enthusiastically.<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a><a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> After the trial, Du Bois lived in Manhattan, writing and speaking, and continuing to associate primarily with leftist acquaintances.<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a> His primary concern was world peace, and he railed against military actions, such as the <a href="Korean_War" title="wikilink">Korean War</a>, which he viewed as efforts by imperialist whites to maintain colored people in a submissive state.<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> <img src="Du_Bois_with_Mao_Tse_Tung_1959B.jpg" title="fig:Du Bois meets with Mao Tse Tung in China in 1959." alt="Du Bois meets with Mao Tse Tung in China in 1959." /> In 1950, at the age of 82, Du Bois <a href="New_York_state_election,_1950" title="wikilink">ran for U.S. Senator</a> from New York on the <a href="American_Labor_Party" title="wikilink">American Labor Party</a> ticket and received about 200,000 votes, or 4% of the statewide total.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a> Du Bois continued to believe that capitalism was the primary culprit responsible for the subjugation of colored people around the world, and therefore &lt;U+2013&gt; although he recognized the faults of the Soviet Union &lt;U+2013&gt; he continued to uphold communism as a possible solution to racial problems.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a> In the words of biographer David Lewis, Du Bois did not endorse communism for its own sake, but did so because &quot;the enemies of his enemies were his friends.&quot;<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a></p>
<p>The U.S. government prevented Du Bois from attending the 1955 <a href="Bandung_conference" title="wikilink">Bandung conference</a> in Indonesia.<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a> The conference was the culmination of 40 years of Du Bois's dreams &lt;U+2013&gt; a meeting of 29 nations from Africa and Asia, many recently independent, representing most of the world's colored peoples.<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a> The conference celebrated their independence, as the nations began to assert their power as non-aligned nations during the cold war.<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a> In 1958, Du Bois regained his passport, and with his second wife, <a href="Shirley_Graham_Du_Bois" title="wikilink">Shirley Graham Du Bois</a>, he traveled around the world, visiting Russia and China.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a> In both countries he was celebrated and given guided tours of the best aspects of communism.<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a> Du Bois was blind to the defects of his host nations &lt;U+2013&gt; even though he toured China during the tragic <a href="Great_Leap_Forward" title="wikilink">Great Leap Forward</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; and he later wrote approvingly of the conditions in both countries.<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a> He was 90 years old.</p>
<p>Du Bois became incensed in 1961 when the <a href="Communist_Party_of_the_United_States_v._Subversive_Activities_Control_Board" title="wikilink">U.S. Supreme Court upheld</a> the 1950 <a href="McCarran_Act" title="wikilink">McCarran Act</a>, a key piece of McCarthyism legislation which required communists to register with the government.<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a> To demonstrate his outrage, he joined the Communist party in October 1961, at the age of 93.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a> Around that time, he wrote: &lt;U+201C&gt;I believe in communism.

<h3 id="religion">Religion</h3>
<p>Although Du Bois attended the New England <a href="Congregational_church" title="wikilink">Congregational church</a> as a child, he abandoned organized religion while at Fisk college.<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a> As an adult, he described himself as <a href="agnostic" class="uri" title="wikilink">agnostic</a> or a <a href="Freethought" title="wikilink">freethinker</a>, and biographer David Lewis concluded that Du Bois was virtually an <a href="atheist" class="uri" title="wikilink">atheist</a>.<a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262"><sup>262</sup></a> When asked to lead public prayers, Du Bois would refuse.<a href="#fn263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263"><sup>263</sup></a> In his autobiography, he wrote: &quot;When I became head of a department at Atlanta, the engagement was held up because again I balked at leading in prayer ... I flatly refused again to join any church or sign any church creed. ... I think the greatest gift of the Soviet Union to modern civilization was the dethronement of the clergy and the refusal to let religion be taught in the public schools.&quot;<a href="#fn264" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref264"><sup>264</sup></a> Du Bois believed that churches in America were the most discriminatory of all institutions.<a href="#fn265" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref265"><sup>265</sup></a> Du Bois occasionally acknowledged the beneficial role religion played in African-America life &lt;U+2013&gt; as the &quot;basic rock&quot; which served as an anchor for African-American communities &lt;U+2013&gt; but in general he disparaged African-American churches and clergy because he felt they did not support the goals of racial equality and they hindered the efforts of activists.<a href="#fn266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266"><sup>266</sup></a> Although Du Bois was not personally religious, he infused his writings with religious symbology, and many of his contemporaries viewed him as a prophet.<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267"><sup>267</sup></a></p>

<p>While visiting Ghana in 1960, Du Bois spoke with its president about the creation of a new encyclopedia of the <a href="African_diaspora" title="wikilink">African diaspora</a>, the <em>Encyclopedia Africana</em>.<a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271"><sup>271</sup></a> In early 1961, Ghana notified Du Bois that they had appropriated funds to support the encyclopedia project, and they invited Du Bois to come to Ghana and manage the project there.

<h2 id="personal-life">Personal life</h2>
<p>Du Bois was organized and disciplined: His lifelong regimen was to rise at 7:15, work until 5, eat dinner and read a newspaper until 7, then read or socialize until he was in bed, invariably before 10.<a href="#fn278" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref278"><sup>278</sup></a> He was a meticulous planner, and frequently mapped-out his schedules and goals on large pieces of graph paper.<a href="#fn279" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref279"><sup>279</sup></a> Many acquaintances found him to be distant and aloof, and he insisted on being addressed as &quot;Dr. Du Bois&quot;.<a href="#fn280" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref280"><sup>280</sup></a> Although he was not gregarious, he formed several close friendships with associates such as <a href="Charles_Young_(United_States_Army)" title="wikilink">Charles Young</a>, <a href="Paul_Laurence_Dunbar" title="wikilink">Paul Laurence Dunbar</a>, <a href="John_Hope_(educator)" title="wikilink">John Hope</a>, and <a href="Mary_Ovington" title="wikilink">Mary Ovington</a>.<a href="#fn281" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref281"><sup>281</sup></a> His closest friend was <a href="Joel_Spingarn" title="wikilink">Joel Spingarn</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; a white man &lt;U+2013&gt; but Du Bois never accepted Spingarn's offer to be on a first name basis.<a href="#fn282" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref282"><sup>282</sup></a> Du Bois was something of a <a href="dandy" class="uri" title="wikilink">dandy</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; he dressed formally, carried a walking stick, and walked with an air of confidence and dignity.<a href="#fn283" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref283"><sup>283</sup></a> He was relatively short &lt;U+2013&gt; 5' 5&lt;U+00BD&gt;&quot; (1.7 m) &lt;U+2013&gt; and always maintained a well-groomed mustache and goatee.<a href="#fn284" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref284"><sup>284</sup></a> He was a good singer and enjoyed playing tennis.<a href="#fn285" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref285"><sup>285</sup></a></p>
<p>Du Bois was married twice, first to Nina Gomer (m. 1896, d. 1950), with whom he had two children, a son Burghardt (who died as an infant) and a daughter Yolande, who married <a href="Countee_Cullen" title="wikilink">Countee Cullen</a>.

<p>The historian David Levering Lewis wrote that Du Bois engaged in several extramarital relationships.<a href="#fn287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref287"><sup>287</sup></a> But, the historian Raymond Wolters cast doubt on this, based on the lack of corroboration from Du Bois's alleged lovers.<a href="#fn288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref288"><sup>288</sup></a></p>
