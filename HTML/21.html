<p><strong>Pampa</strong> (<a href="Kannada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kannada</a>: &lt;U+0CAA&gt;&lt;U+0C82&gt;&lt;U+0CAA&gt;) born in <a href="902" class="uri" title="wikilink">902</a> C.E., also known as Adikavi Pampa, is one of the greatest <a href="Kannada_literature" title="wikilink">Kannada</a> poets of all time. He was born in Vemulavada, <a href="Andhra_Pradesh" title="wikilink">Andhra Pradesh</a> and was the court poet of King Arikesari, a <a href="Rashtrakuta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rashtrakuta</a> feudatory.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Born to a <a href="Jainism" title="wikilink">Jaina</a> family of <a href="Brahmin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brahmin</a> ancestry, he grew up mastering the <a href="Sanskrit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sanskrit</a> and <a href="Prakrit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prakrit</a> classics as well as Jain Philosophy. Known from an early age as being deeply interested in various subjects like music, philosophy, economics and sculpture, he soon gained mastery over many of these subjects. Sensitive, modest and imaginative, Pampa has earned a veritable place in the world of <a href="Kannada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kannada</a> literature, which has remained unquestioned even today.</p>
<h2 id="poetic-life">Poetic life</h2>
<p>A well travelled man, he settled down as the court poet of King Arekesari II, a <a href="Chalukya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chalukya</a> king and a <a href="Rashtrakuta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rashtrakuta</a> feudatory. At the age of 39 he wrote his first masterpiece, <em>Adipurana</em> in <a href="941" class="uri" title="wikilink">941</a> and a little later he completed <em>Vikramarjuna Vijaya</em> popularly known as <em>Pampa Bharata</em>. These two works have remained unparalleled works of classic Kannada composition.</p>
<h2 id="adipurana">Adipurana</h2>
<p>Adipurana written in Champu style, a mixed form of prose and verse is a Kannada version of the Sanskrit work by Jinasena and details the life of Adinatha (<em>Vrishabhadeva</em>) in sixteen cantos, the first Jain <a href="Tirthankar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tirthankar</a>. The work focusses in his own unique style the piligrimage of a soul to perfection and attainment of <em>mukti</em>. In the work, Pampa describes the struggle for power and control over the entire world of two brothers Bharata and Bahubali, sons of Vrishabhadeva. While Bahubali wins, he renounces the wordly pursuits in favour of his brother. Many Jaina <em>puranas</em> of middle ages found a role model in this work.</p>
<h2 id="vikramarjuna-vijaya">Vikramarjuna Vijaya</h2>
<p><strong>Vikramarjuna Vijaya</strong>, also known as <strong>Pampa Bharata</strong>, is a Kannada version of the <a href="Mahabharata" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mahabharata</a> which was originally written by <a href="Vyasa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vyasa</a>. While Vyasa's work does not focus on any one particular hero of the epic, various sections of the epic tend to eulogise various characters. However, Pampa choose to make in his work king Arikesari a hero. He personified the king and centred his work around the <a href="Pandava" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pandava</a>, <a href="Arjuna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arjuna</a>. So much is his focus on Arjuna that through out the epic, Arjuna remains the hero. Even after the war of <a href="Kurukshetra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kurukshetra</a>, it is not <a href="Dharmaraya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dharmaraya</a> who is crowned king but Arjuna and his wife <a href="Subhadra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Subhadra</a> becomes the queen royal. It is said that <a href="Bhima" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bhima</a> who played such a big role in Vyasa's epic and Draupadi who suffered much humiliation are not given much credit in Pampa's work.</p>
