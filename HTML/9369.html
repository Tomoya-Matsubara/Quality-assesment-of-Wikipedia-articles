<p>The bridge crosses the <a href="River_Avill" title="wikilink">River Avill</a> which rises on the eastern slopes of <a href="Dunkery_Beacon" title="wikilink">Dunkery Beacon</a> and flows north through <a href="Timberscombe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Timberscombe</a> and <a href="Dunster" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dunster</a> flowing into the <a href="Bristol_Channel" title="wikilink">Bristol Channel</a> at Dunster Beach. It is likely that there was a previous bridge on the same site as in the 14th century it was known as Doddebrigge.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The bridge may have been at the limit of the tidal mouth of the river during the medieval period.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Dunster Beach, which includes the mouth of the River Avill, is now located approximately  from the village, and used to have a significant harbour, known as Dunster Haven, which was used for the export of wool from <a href="Anglo-Saxons" title="wikilink">Saxon</a> times; however, it was last used in the 17th century and has now disappeared among the dykes, meadows and marshes near the shore.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Dunster had become a centre for woollen and clothing production by the 13th century, with the market dating back to at least 1222, and a particular kind of kersey or broadcloth became known as 'Dunsters'.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The prosperity of Dunster was based on the wool trade, with profits helping to pay for the construction of the tower of the <a href="Priory_Church_of_St_George,_Dunster" title="wikilink">Priory Church of St George</a> and provide other amenities.</p>
<p>The name Gallox is believed to be derived from gallows as the village <a href="gallows" class="uri" title="wikilink">gallows</a> were nearby,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> when it was called Gallocksbrigge.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The bridge is close to <a href="Dunster_Working_Watermill" title="wikilink">Dunster Working Watermill</a> and the base of the hill on which <a href="Dunster_Castle" title="wikilink">Dunster Castle</a> sits and povides access to the site of the <a href="Deer_park_(England)" title="wikilink">Deer park</a>.
