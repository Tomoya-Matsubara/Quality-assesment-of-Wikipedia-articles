<p>The <strong>Socialist Alliance</strong> was a <a href="left-wing" class="uri" title="wikilink">left-wing</a> <a href="electoral_alliance" title="wikilink">electoral alliance</a> operating in <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a> in existence between 1992 and 2005 and is currently (after being re-founded in late 2005) a small grouping with a mutual affiliation with the larger <a href="Alliance_for_Green_Socialism" title="wikilink">Alliance for Green Socialism</a>.</p>

<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
<p>The alliance grew out of local Socialist Alliances, many of which ran in elections as the <em>United Socialists</em>. These were formed by the <a href="Socialist_Party_of_England_and_Wales" title="wikilink">Socialist Party of England and Wales</a>, <a href="Alliance_for_Workers&#39;_Liberty" title="wikilink">Alliance for Workers' Liberty</a>, <a href="Independent_Labour_Network" title="wikilink">Independent Labour Network</a> and independent <a href="socialist" title="wikilink">socialists</a>, from <a href="1992" class="uri" title="wikilink">1992</a> onward. They gradually coalesced into the national <em>Network of Socialist Alliances</em>. The <a href="Welsh_Socialist_Alliance" title="wikilink">Welsh Socialist Alliance</a> was closely allied to the SA but had separate origins.</p>
<p>The Socialist Alliance was named and expanded in <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a>, when other <a href="Trotskyist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trotskyist</a> groups including the <a href="Socialist_Workers_Party_(Britain)" title="wikilink">Socialist Workers Party</a>, the <a href="International_Socialist_Group" title="wikilink">International Socialist Group</a> and <a href="Workers_Power_(UK)" title="wikilink">Workers Power</a> joined, as did the formerly separate <a href="London_Socialist_Alliance" title="wikilink">London Socialist Alliance</a>. In the <a href="UK_local_elections,_2002" title="wikilink">2002 local elections</a>, the alliance gained one councillor in <a href="Preston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Preston</a>. The Socialist Alliance had fraternal relations with the <a href="Scottish_Socialist_Party" title="wikilink">Scottish Socialist Party</a>.</p>
<h2 id="contraction-and-dissolution">Contraction and dissolution</h2>
<p>In late 2001 the Network of Socialist Alliances was transformed into a one-member-one-vote political party called the Socialist Alliance (a title already registered for electoral purposes). This new structure allowed the largest and most disciplined group within the Socialist Alliance to exercise a dominant and controlling role - if that organised group was a Democratic Centralist political party (ie. able to instruct its members how to vote) then this was essentially a block vote.</p>
<p>The Socialist Alliance was riven by feuds, mostly concerning the behaviour of the Socialist Workers Party, which was by far the largest group participating in the Alliance, and which many felt dominated it. The Socialist Party of England and Wales left the Alliance in <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>, while Workers Power left in <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>.</p>
<p>In 2003 the SWP, supported by the ISG, led the SA into an alliance with <a href="George_Galloway" title="wikilink">George Galloway</a> and other figures involved in the <a href="Stop_the_War_Coalition" title="wikilink">Stop the War Coalition</a> to form the <a href="RESPECT_The_Unity_Coalition" title="wikilink">Respect Coalition</a>. A minority of the SA objected to the way this decision was carried out and argued that the SWP were using their <a href="Voting_block" title="wikilink">block vote</a> to push their line. Many of these dissidented object to Respect on principle, and all objected to the way the decision to join it was carried out, many forming the <a href="Socialist_Alliance_Democracy_Platform" title="wikilink">Socialist Alliance Democracy Platform</a>.</p>
<p>In late 2004, some SA member organisations, which remained outside Respect, joined with the Socialist Party and the <a href="Alliance_for_Green_Socialism" title="wikilink">Alliance for Green Socialism</a> to establish the <a href="Socialist_Green_Unity_Coalition" title="wikilink">Socialist Green Unity Coalition</a>.</p>
<p>The SA was wound up in <a href="February_2005" title="wikilink">February 2005</a>, having been moribund for about a year. In March, a few groups and former members of the SA, who did not join in the Respect Coalition, met as the <em>Socialist Alliance (Provisional)</em>. On November 12, 2005, most but not all of the provisional grouping met again and claimed the name of the Socialist Alliance for a re-founded political organisation. This re-founded organisation has failed to grow but remains in existence and in 2007 it entered into a mutual affiliation with its largest supporting organisation - the <a href="Alliance_for_Green_Socialism" title="wikilink">Alliance for Green Socialism</a>. The registered electoral title of Socialist Alliance is retained by this organisation.</p>
<p>The SA now fully supports the <a href="Campaign_for_a_New_Workers&#39;_Party" title="wikilink">Campaign for a New Workers' Party</a> and even has elected members of the steering committee.</p>
