<p><strong>Operation Swath-10</strong> () was a military offensive undertaken by the <a href="Croatian_Army" title="wikilink">Croatian Army</a> (<em>Hrvatska vojska</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; HV) against the <a href="SAO_Western_Slavonia" title="wikilink">SAO Western Slavonia</a> <a href="Territorial_Defense_Forces_(Yugoslavia)" title="wikilink">Territorial Defense Forces</a> on the <a href="Bilogora" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bilogora</a> Mountain, in the region of western <a href="Slavonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slavonia</a>. The operation took place from 31 October till 4 November 1991 during the <a href="Croatian_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">Croatian War of Independence</a> and ended in a Croatian victory. The military success set the stage for follow-up advances by the Croatian forces on the <a href="Papuk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Papuk</a> Mountain in Operation Papuk-91 fought in late November and December. By the end of the year, the HV gained control of the entire Papuk, securing transport routes between eastern Slavonia and the rest of <a href="Croatia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croatia</a>.</p>
<p>The offensives were accompanied by displacement of nearly entire <a href="Croatian_Serb" title="wikilink">Croatian Serb</a> population of the area captured by the HV. The refugees initially fled to <a href="Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="wikilink">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, but most of them were soon settled in <a href="Yugoslav_People&#39;s_Army" title="wikilink">Yugoslav People's Army</a>-held <a href="Baranja" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baranja</a> region in the east of Croatia. The event provoked accusations that the Croatian troops committed <a href="ethnic_cleansing" title="wikilink">ethnic cleansing</a> and abuses of <a href="civil_rights" title="wikilink">civil rights</a> in the offensive. The accusations were contradicted by a <a href="European_Community_Monitor_Mission" title="wikilink">European Community Monitor Mission</a> (ECMM) report made following an ECMM team tour of the area captured by the Croatian forces, two days after the offensive ended. During Operation Papuk-91, retreating <a href="White_Eagles_(paramilitary)" title="wikilink">White Eagles</a> paramilitaries committed the <a href="Vo&lt;U+0107&gt;in_massacre" title="wikilink">Vo&lt;U+0107&gt;in massacre</a>.

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Within the <a href="1991_Yugoslav_campaign_in_Croatia" title="wikilink">1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia</a>, the 5th (<a href="Banja_Luka" title="wikilink">Banja Luka</a>) Corps of the <a href="Yugoslav_People&#39;s_Army" title="wikilink">Yugoslav People's Army</a> (<em>Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; JNA) was tasked with advancing north through western <a href="Slavonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slavonia</a> region, from <a href="Oku&lt;U+010D&gt;ani" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oku&lt;U+010D&gt;ani</a> to <a href="Daruvar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Daruvar</a> and <a href="Virovitica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virovitica</a>, and with a secondary drive from Oku&lt;U+010D&gt;ani towards <a href="Kutina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kutina</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> This task was essentially consistent with the line expected to be reached by the main thrust of the JNA advancing from the eastern Slavonia in about a week. The linkup was designed to facilitate a further advance west to <a href="Zagreb" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zagreb</a> and <a href="Vara&lt;U+017E&gt;din" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vara&lt;U+017E&gt;din</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The Corps had already deployed a <a href="Battlegroup_(army)" title="wikilink">battlegroup</a> of the 265th Mechanised Brigade near Oku&lt;U+010D&gt;ani to support the advance that started on 21 September, and reached the <a href="Papuk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Papuk</a> Mountains. The corps received two motorised and one artillery brigades as reinforcements during the advance, but the problems with morale and desertions experienced by the JNA elsewhere were also present in the Banja Luka Corps.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The JNA was stopped by the <a href="Croatian_National_Guard" title="wikilink">Croatian National Guard</a> (<em>Zbor Narodne Garde</em> - ZNG) between <a href="Novska" class="uri" title="wikilink">Novska</a>, <a href="Nova_Gradi&lt;U+0161&gt;ka" title="wikilink">Nova Gradi&lt;U+0161&gt;ka</a> and <a href="Pakrac" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pakrac</a>, even though <a href="SAO_Western_Slavonia" title="wikilink">SAO Western Slavonia</a> <a href="Territorial_Defense_Forces_(Yugoslavia)" title="wikilink">Territorial Defense Forces</a> (<em>Teritorijalna odbrana</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; TO) units took positions on the <a href="Bilogora" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bilogora</a> and Papuk north of Pakrac, near Virovitica and <a href="Slatina,_Croatia" title="wikilink">Slatina</a> with no JNA support.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Capture of <a href="Ivanovo_Selo" title="wikilink">Ivanovo Selo</a>,  east of <a href="Grubi&lt;U+0161&gt;no_Polje" title="wikilink">Grubi&lt;U+0161&gt;no Polje</a> and  north of Daruvar on 21 September marked the territorial peak of the TO-held area on the Bilogora.

<p>On 1 October, the Banja Luka Corps initiated probing attacks in the region, presaging a major effort employing the bulk of the corps three days later. The advance established defensive positions just outside Novska and Nova Gradi&lt;U+0161&gt;ka.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> On 6 October, Pakrac was briefly isolated when the JNA captured <a href="Batinjani,_Bjelovar-Bilogora_County" title="wikilink">Batinjani</a>  northwest of the town, interdicting the last road available for supply of Pakrac. The ZNG recaptured the village the same day and drove the JNA back , but it sustained 22 killed in the action.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The JNA captured <a href="Jasenovac,_Sisak-Moslavina_County" title="wikilink">Jasenovac</a> on 8 October. <a href="Lipik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lipik</a> and a part of Pakrac were captured four days later.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> By that time the JNA offensive in western Slavonia had lost its momentum,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and the ZNG made minor advances north of Novska and west of Nova Gradi&lt;U+0161&gt;ka on 13 and 16 October.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The Croatian authorities considered that the war situation was no longer critical.

<h2 id="order-of-battle">Order of battle</h2>
<p>The TO forces in the Bilogora Mountain region were formally a part of the 28th Partisan Division, commanded by <a href="Colonel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colonel</a> Nikola Mari&lt;U+0107&gt;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In reality, the TO forces comprised approximately 1,750 soldiers provided with eight <a href="armoured_vehicle" title="wikilink">armoured vehicles</a>, ten cannons and twelve mortars.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The TO-force was organised in two battalions, headquartered in the villages of <a href="Mali_Gr&lt;U+0111&gt;evac" title="wikilink">Mali Gr&lt;U+0111&gt;evac</a> and Velika Peratovica, jointly commanded by Rade &lt;U+010C&gt;akmak<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> North of the TO-held area, the ZNG deployed the 127th Infantry Brigade in Virovitica area.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In Grubi&lt;U+0161&gt;no Polje area, south of the Bilogora, the ZNG force was subordinated to the 57th Independent Battalion (later renamed the 77th Independent Battalion).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The attacking ZNG force, under command of Colonel Franjo Kova&lt;U+010D&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> consisted of 2,647 troops, supported by twelve armoured vehicles, eighteen cannons and twenty  mortarsâ€”surpassing the defending TO force in every aspect except for the <a href="close_air_support" title="wikilink">close air support</a> provided by the <a href="Yugoslav_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Yugoslav Air Force</a> to the TO.

<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>

<p>Operation Swath-10 was tasked with restoring the <a href="D5_road_(Croatia)" title="wikilink">Virovitica&lt;U+2013&gt;Lon&lt;U+010D&gt;arica&lt;U+2013&gt;Grubi&lt;U+0161&gt;no Polje road</a> to Croatian control, cutting off and destroying the TO forces deployed in the area of the roadâ€”the northernmost part of the western Slavonia captured by the TO or the JNA. Furthermore, those objectives were also designed to deny the Banja Luka Corps support if it attempted to break through towards Virovitica, controlling the last remaining supply route between Zagreb and Slavonia, shorten Croatian defensive positions and improve morale of the troops and civilian population.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The offensive was originally scheduled for 15 October, but it was postponed for two weeks due to unavailability of the 105th Infantry Brigade and the special police. The operation plan expected the ZNG to cut off the two TO battalions on the Bilogora Mountain within two days of fighting, and the second stage of the offensive called for destruction of the trapped TO force.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The operation was authorised by Colonel Miroslav Jezer&lt;U+010D&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt;, commander of Bjelovar Operational Zone as early as 7 October.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The offensive was launched at 6Â am on 31 October. A 50-minute <a href="Barrage_(artillery)" title="wikilink">artillery bombardment</a> was followed by ZNG advance in three groups.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The 57th Independent Battalion advanced from the south, the 127th Infantry Brigade from the north and the 1st Battalion of the 127th Infantry Brigade from the northwest.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The same day, the ZNG captured the villages of <a href="Velika_Barna" title="wikilink">Velika Barna</a>, <a href="Gornja_Kova&lt;U+010D&gt;ica" title="wikilink">Gornja Kova&lt;U+010D&gt;ica</a> and <a href="Zrinska" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zrinska</a> northwest of Grubi&lt;U+0161&gt;no Polje&lt;U+2013&gt;<a href="Veliki_Gr&lt;U+0111&gt;evac" title="wikilink">Veliki Gr&lt;U+0111&gt;evac</a> road. That also secured the Grubi&lt;U+0161&gt;no Polje The ZNG also advanced along the Virovitica&lt;U+2013&gt;Grubi&lt;U+0161&gt;no Polje road, arriving at the outskirts of Mala Peratovica,  east of Grubi&lt;U+0161&gt;no Polje, and approaching <a href="Lon&lt;U+010D&gt;arica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lon&lt;U+010D&gt;arica</a>,  south of Virovitica.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The TO forces offered strong resistance, especially near Lon&lt;U+010D&gt;arica, even though the battlefield situation was described as hopeless. The TO requested Yugoslav Air Force to provide close air support,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and between four and six aircraft were deployed in response.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>On 1 November, the ZNG conducted mop-up in the areas northwest of Grubi&lt;U+0161&gt;no Polje. The next day, the TO force started to retreat towards the Papuk Mountain. Lon&lt;U+010D&gt;arica and Dap&lt;U+010D&gt;eva&lt;U+010D&gt;ki Br&lt;U+0111&gt;ani (another village situated approximately  northeast of Mala Peratovica along the Virovitica&lt;U+2013&gt;Grubi&lt;U+0161&gt;no Polje road) were captured by the Croatian force on 3 November, after they defeated strong TO resistance.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> That day, the ZNG was renamed the <a href="Croatian_Army" title="wikilink">Croatian Army</a> (<em>Hrvatska vojska</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; HV).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> After the two villages were captured, the HV forces advancing from Grubi&lt;U+0161&gt;no Polje and Virovitica linked up.

<p>On 10 November, the 57th Independent Battalion advanced against the TO in the village of Veliki Miletinac, east of the area captured in Operation Swath-10, capturing the village the same day. Neighbouring Mali Miletinac was captured by the HV the next day. On 12 November, the HV captured the villages of Bastajski Br&lt;U+0111&gt;ani and Reki&lt;U+0107&gt;i. Two days later, the TO counterattacked and inflicted HV casualties of 9 dead and approximately 10 wounded, but the HV defence held. Another effort to recapture Bastajski Br&lt;U+0111&gt;ani was made by the TO, reinforced with 50 <a href="White_Eagles_(paramilitary)" title="wikilink">White Eagles</a> paramilitaries. The attack failed even though it was well prepared and supported by artillery because the defending HV force was alerted through <a href="signals_intelligence" title="wikilink">signals intelligence</a> and reinforced in anticipation of the attack.

The following three days the HV performed mopping up of the area.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>On 21 December, the HV launched a failed attack on Kamenska and the adjacent village of <a href="Mija&lt;U+010D&gt;i" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mija&lt;U+010D&gt;i</a> (codenamed Prkos). The TO withdrew from the area north of Kamenska, including the village of Sa&lt;U+017E&gt;ije on 24 December, and it retreated from Kamenska and Mija&lt;U+010D&gt;i the next day. The HV forces deployed in the area of Pakrac, west of the Papuk and the Psunj, advanced east to support the Operation Papuk-91, capturing the villages of <a href="Dereza,_Po&lt;U+017E&gt;ega-Slavonia_County" title="wikilink">Dereza</a>, Gornji Grahovljani, Donji Grahovljani, <a href="Kusonje" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kusonje</a> and <a href="&lt;U+0160&gt;panovica" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+0160&gt;panovica</a> on 24&lt;U+2013&gt;25 December, leaving less than  of the Pakrac&lt;U+2013&gt;Po&lt;U+017E&gt;ega road in between the HV units advancing from the west and the east.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Operation Papuk-91 was concluded on 26 December, when the forces of the 123rd, the 127th and the 136th brigades linked up at <a href="Bu&lt;U+010D&gt;je,_Pakrac" title="wikilink">Bu&lt;U+010D&gt;je</a>.

<p>In Operation Swath-10, the HV sustained loss of five dead.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> It captured  of western Slavonia containing 21 villages. While the HV met the objective of securing the Virovitica&lt;U+2013&gt;Grubi&lt;U+0161&gt;no Polje road it failed to trap the TO troops deployed to the area. This was later attributed to insufficient forces required to accomplish the goal, specifically unavailability of the 105th Infantry Brigade or possibly the 73rd Independent (<a href="Gare&lt;U+0161&gt;nica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gare&lt;U+0161&gt;nica</a>) Battalion. The two units were deployed in the area of Pakrac instead. The positions reached by the HV set the stage for further advance against the SAO Western Slavonia in Operation Papuk-91.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Some sources conflate Operations Swath-10 and Papuk-91, presenting the latter as a part of Operation Swath-10.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Operation Papuk-91 completely eliminated threat to the road connecting the eastern Slavonia and Zagreb because the TO forces were pushed sufficiently far south, placing the road out of range of artillery.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> In Operation Papuk-19, the HV captured 110 settlements,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> as well as approximately  of territory.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2008, a monument to HV troops who took part in the offensive was unveiled in Grubi&lt;U+0161&gt;no Polje.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Another monument was erected on the Papuk Mountain to the 11 soldiers of the 123rd Infantry Brigade ambushed in Operation Papuk-91 on 2 December 1991.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Operations Swath-10, Papuk-91, and Hurricane-91, executed in western Slavonia in late 1991, are considered to be the first Croatian offensive operations of liberation in the Croatian War of Independence.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_the_former_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) charged <a href="Vojislav_&lt;U+0160&gt;e&lt;U+0161&gt;elj" title="wikilink">Vojislav &lt;U+0160&gt;e&lt;U+0161&gt;elj</a> with a series of <a href="war_crime" title="wikilink">war crimes</a>, including the killings committed by the White Eagles paramilitaries in Vo&lt;U+0107&gt;in on 13 December. The trial concluded in 2012, but the verdict is still pending .<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> <a href="Slobodan_Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Slobodan Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, President of Serbia at the time of the killings, was also charged by the ICTY for the crimes committed in Vo&lt;U+0107&gt;in. Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt; died before his trial at the ICTY was completed.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="refugees">Refugees</h3>
<p><a href="Croatian_Serb" title="wikilink">Croatian Serb</a> civilian population fled the area affected by Operation Swath-10. According to Serbian sources, the population started to flee on the first day of the offensive, and by the second day approximately 800 vehicles left the region and crossed into <a href="Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="wikilink">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>. The retreating columns included men of military age who refused to fight.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> A substantial proportion of the refugees were settled in <a href="Baranja" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baranja</a>, in houses owned by <a href="Croat" title="wikilink">Croats</a> displaced from the region.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Based on the reports of the fleeing civilians, <a href="SFR_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">Yugoslav</a> government accused Croatia of <a href="ethnic_cleansing" title="wikilink">ethnic cleansing</a> and other <a href="civil_rights" title="wikilink">civil rights</a> violations. Deputy prime minister Aleksandar Mitrovi&lt;U+0107&gt; wrote to the <a href="European_Community_Monitor_Mission" title="wikilink">European Community Monitor Mission</a> (ECMM), accusing Croatia of causing numerous casualties, devastation and displacement of Serb civilians. Even though the accusations were contrasted by evacuation plans put together by SAO Western Slavonia authorities on 25 October,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> and by testimony of civilians who remained in the area and claimed that the TO called the population to flee claiming &quot;<a href="Usta&lt;U+0161&gt;e" class="uri" title="wikilink">Usta&lt;U+0161&gt;e</a> are coming [...] killing every Serb&quot;,<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> media in Serbia widely <a href="Role_of_the_media_in_the_Yugoslav_wars" title="wikilink">reported on alleged atrocities</a>. The reports related the Croatian offensive to <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> and <a href="List_of_massacres_in_the_Independent_State_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">massacres committed by the Independent State of Croatia</a> in that period.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> On 3 November, the <a href="Presidency_of_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">Presidency of Yugoslavia</a> condemned the offensive citing destruction of 18 Serb villages, and the next day the <a href="National_Assembly_(Serbia)" title="wikilink">National Assembly</a> of Serbia appealed to the international community for help.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>In response to the situation and a request received from the Presidency of Yugoslavia, an ECMM team toured the area affected by the offensive on 6 November, targeting those locations where the media reports indicated the atrocities occurred, including Velika Peratovica, Mala Peratovica, Gornja Ra&lt;U+0161&gt;enica, Donja Ra&lt;U+0161&gt;enica and Lon&lt;U+010D&gt;arica. The ECMM report of 6 November refuted the accusations. The ECMM team found only one Serb couple remaining in the area, but they denied claims that the HV mistreated the civilians left behind. The ECMM team reported that there was no systematic destruction of houses, even though a number of structures exhibited artillery bombardment damage and a small number of houses, farms and <a href="haystack" title="wikilink">haystacks</a> were recently torched. However, the report states that the team was unable to determine if the HV was to blame, or if the villagers took revenge against SAO Western Krajina leaders, or if the destruction was a result of a <a href="scorched_earth" title="wikilink">scorched earth</a> policy applied by the retreating force.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>The HV offensives in western Slavonia conducted in late 1991â€”Operations Hurricane-10, Swath-10, and Papuk-91â€”created a total of 20,000 Serb refugees. They fled from the area when the JNA ordered the Croatian Serb forces to withdraw,<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> and were subsequently settled in JNA-held Baranja region in the east of Croatia.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="ceasefire">Ceasefire</h3>

<p>A ceasefire of 3 January 1992 allowed implementation of the <a href="Vance_plan" title="wikilink">Vance plan</a>, which provided for protection of civilians in specific areas designated as <a href="United_Nations_Protected_Area_(UNPROFOR)" title="wikilink">UN Protected Areas</a> (UNPAs) and deployment of UN peacekeepers in Croatia.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> One of the UNPAs defined by the plan, UNPA Western Slavonia, encompassed parts of municipalities of Novska and Nova Gradi&lt;U+0161&gt;ka, as well as entire municipalities of Daruvar, Grubi&lt;U+0161&gt;no Polje and Pakrac. Thus the UNPA covered the area held by the JNA on 3 January, additional territory to the north, recaptured by the HV in late 1991, and towns which never came under SAO Western Slavonia controlâ€”such as Grubi&lt;U+0161&gt;no Polje and Daruvar.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The peacekeeping force named <a href="United_Nations_Protection_Force" title="wikilink">United Nations Protection Force</a> (UNPROFOR), initially expected to be 10,000-strong,<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> started to deploy on 8 March.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
