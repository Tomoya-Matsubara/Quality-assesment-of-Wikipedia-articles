<p><strong>Chemical Bank</strong> was a bank with headquarters in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> from 1823 until 1996. The bank operated as the primary subsidiary of the <strong>Chemical Banking Corporation</strong>, a <a href="bank_holding_company" title="wikilink">bank holding company</a> established in 1988.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1920 but accelerating in the 1980s and 1990s, Chemical was a leading consolidator of the banking industry in the United States, acquiring <a href="Chase_Manhattan_Bank" title="wikilink">Chase Manhattan Bank</a>, <a href="Manufacturers_Hanover" title="wikilink">Manufacturers Hanover</a>, <a href="Texas_Commerce_Bank" title="wikilink">Texas Commerce Bank</a> and <a href="Corn_Exchange_Bank" title="wikilink">Corn Exchange Bank</a> among others. Following Chemical's acquisition of Chase, the bank adopted the venerable <a href="Chase_(bank)" title="wikilink">Chase</a> brand. What had been Chemical Bank, is at the core of what today is <a href="JPMorgan_Chase" title="wikilink">JPMorgan Chase</a>.</p>
<p>Chemical Bank was headquartered in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>.</p>

It produced <a href="chemical" title="wikilink">chemicals</a> such as <a href="blue_vitriol" title="wikilink">blue vitriol</a>, <a href="alum" class="uri" title="wikilink">alum</a>, <a href="nitric_acid" title="wikilink">nitric acid</a>, <a href="camphor" class="uri" title="wikilink">camphor</a> and <a href="saltpeter" class="uri" title="wikilink">saltpeter</a>, as well as medicines, paints, and <a href="dye" title="wikilink">dyes</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>Chemical's charter was amended in 1824 to allow banking practices and in 1844, when New York Chemical Manufacturing Company's original charter expired, the chemical company was liquidated and the company was reincorporated as a bank only, becoming the Chemical Bank of New York in 1844. The company sold all remaining inventories from the chemical division as well as real estate holdings by 1851.</p>
<p>During the <a href="Panic_of_1857" title="wikilink">Panic of 1857</a>, Chemical Bank earned the nickname &quot;Old Bullion&quot; by redeeming bank notes in <a href="specie" class="uri" title="wikilink">specie</a> after most of the other banks, which had been hit hard, had turned to issuing paper promissory notes.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> While hundreds of banks closed, including 18 banks in New York in a single day, Chemical developed a reputation for stability. This reputation proved extremely important in Chemical's growth during subsequent recessions during the 1860s. Chemical received its <a href="national_charter" title="wikilink">national charter</a> as the Chemical National Bank of New York in 1865 and, by the early 1870s, Chemical had deposits in excess of $6 million.</p>

<p>By the first decade of the 20th century, Chemical was in decline, losing accounts each year. Unlike many of its peers, Chemical had been reuluctant to expand into securities and other businesses and had not paid interest on bank accounts. In 1917, Chemical named a new president of the bank, Herbert Twitchell,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> who completed a major turnaround of Chemical, setting up a trust business. Chemical's reversal of its interest bearing account policy, resulted in an increase in deposits from $35 million to $81 million by 1920.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>In 1920, Chemical completed its first major acquisition, merging with Citizens National Bank. The acqusition of Citizens National, a small New York commercial bank, increased Chemical's assets to more than $200 million with more than $140 million of deposits.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In 1923 Chemical established its first branch and by the end of the 1920s had opened a dozen branches in Manhatttan and Brooklyn as well as a branch in London, its first international presence.</p>
<p>In 1929, Chemical reincorporated as a state bank in New York as Chemical Bank &amp; Trust Company and merged with the United States Mortgage &amp; Trust Company, headquartered on the <a href="Madison_Avenue" title="wikilink">Madison Avenue</a> and <a href="74th_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">74th Street</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> During the Depression-era of the 1930s, Chemical's deposits grew by more than 40% and in 1941, the bank reached $1 billion of assets. During this period, Chemical also established Chemical National Company a securities underwriting business.</p>
<p>The bank began a series of mergers in the late 1940s and 1950s. In 1947, Chemical merged with Continental Bank and Trust Company. Chemical completed its largest acquisition to that point, merging with the <a href="Corn_Exchange_Bank" title="wikilink">Corn Exchange Bank</a> to become the <strong>Chemical Corn Exchange Bank</strong> in 1954. Founded in 1853, the Corn Exchange Bank was based in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, but had built a network of branches in other states through the acquisition of community banks.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The merger with the Corn Exchange Bank added 98 additional branches to Chemical's system largely in the New York City.</p>
<h3 id="section-1">1959 - 1979</h3>

<p>In 1968, Chemical reorganized itself as a <a href="bank_holding_company" title="wikilink">bank holding company</a> which allowed for more rapid expansion.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Throughout the early 1960s Chemical had begun to expand into New York's suburbs, opening branches on <a href="Long_Island" title="wikilink">Long Island</a> and in <a href="Westchester_County" title="wikilink">Westchester County</a>. However by the late 1960s and early 1970s, Chemical was focused on building its international business. In these years, Chemical opened new offices in the <a href="Frankfurt,_Germany" title="wikilink">Frankfurt, Germany</a> (1969), <a href="Zurich,_Switzerland" title="wikilink">Zurich, Switzerland</a> (1971), <a href="Brussels,_Belgium" title="wikilink">Brussels, Belgium</a> (1971), <a href="Paris,_France" title="wikilink">Paris, France</a> (1971) and <a href="Tokyo,_Japan" title="wikilink">Tokyo, Japan</a> (1972).</p>
<p>In 1975, Chemical acquired Security National Bank, which had a branch network on <a href="Long_Island" title="wikilink">Long Island</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>Chemical and <a href="Florida_National_Bank" title="wikilink">Florida National Bank</a> agreed, in 1982, to enter into a merger, after laws preventing interstate banking were lifted, giving Chemical an option to acquire the business.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In February, 1982, <a href="Southeast_Banking_Corporation" title="wikilink">Southeast Banking Corporation</a> (SBC), which had been rebuffed in its attempted to acquire Florida National sued to obtain an injunction against the Chemical merger.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In early 1983, Southeast Banking Corporation dropped its takeover attempt and agreed to exchange their Florida National shares for 24 FNB branch offices and other consideration.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Following the deal with SBC, Florida National was cleared to merge with Chemical, however interstate banking acquisitions were still prohibited by Federal law and required state legislative approval.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> With the 1990 deadline running out for its option to buy Florida National and no sign of state legislative approval, Chemical Bank sold their 4.9% interest to <a href="First_Union_Corporation" title="wikilink">First Union Corporation</a> for $115 million.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>Chemical completed its largest transaction of the 1980s in December 1986, when the bank agreed to acquire <a href="Texas_Commerce_Bank" title="wikilink">Texas Commerce Bank</a>. The $1.1 billion transaction represented the largest interstate banking merger in U.S. history to that time.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Texas Commerce, which was officially acquired in May 1987, was one of the largest bank holding companies in the Southwestern U.S., with a strong presence in corporate banking for small and medium sized businesses. Chemical did not seek <a href="FDIC" class="uri" title="wikilink">FDIC</a> backing for its acquisition of Texas Commerce although other large Texas banks, <a href="First_RepublicBank_Corporation" title="wikilink">First RepublicBank Corporation</a> (Acquired by <a href="NationsBank" class="uri" title="wikilink">NationsBank</a>) and <a href="MCorp_Bank" title="wikilink">MCorp Bank</a> (acquired by <a href="Bank_One" title="wikilink">Bank One</a>), received over $5 billion of support. Ultimately Chemical contributed $300 million to shore Texas Commerce as it continued to suffer losses.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Also in 1986, Chemical agreed to a merger with New Jersey-based <a href="Horizon_Bancorp" title="wikilink">Horizon Bancorp</a>, although the merger was not completed until 1989, due again to interstate banking rules.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The bank's holding company, which had been the Chemical New York Corporation was renamed the <strong>Chemical Banking Corporation</strong> in 1988 following its series of out of state mergers and acquisitions, including <a href="Texas_Commerce_Bank" title="wikilink">Texas Commerce Bank</a> and <a href="Horizon_Bancorp" title="wikilink">Horizon Bancorp</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>It was during this period, in the 1980s and early 1990s, that Chemical emerged as one of the leaders in the financing of <a href="leveraged_buyout" title="wikilink">leveraged buyout</a> transactions. By the late 1980s, Chemical developed its reputation for financing buyouts, building a <a href="leveraged_finance" title="wikilink">syndicated leveraged finance</a> business and related advisory businesses under the auspices of pioneering investment banker, <a href="James_B._Lee,_Jr." title="wikilink">Jimmy Lee</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> It was not until 1993 that Chemical would permission to underwrite corporate bonds, however within a few years, Chemical (and later Chase) became a major underwriter of below-investment-grade debt under Lee. Additionally, in 1984, Chemical launched <a href="Chemical_Venture_Partners" title="wikilink">Chemical Venture Partners</a> to invest in <a href="private_equity" title="wikilink">private equity</a> transactions alongside various <a href="financial_sponsor" title="wikilink">financial sponsors</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="s-1">1990s</h3>

<p>In July 1991, Chemical announced that it would acquire <a href="Manufacturers_Hanover_Corporation" title="wikilink">Manufacturers Hanover Corporation</a> in a $135 billion merger transaction.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> At the time of the merger, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover were the sixth and ninth largest banks, respectively, by assets. The transaction, when it closed at the end of 1991, made the combined bank, which retained the Chemical name, the second largest bank in the U.S., behind <a href="Citicorp" class="uri" title="wikilink">Citicorp</a> both in terms of assets and customers (approximately 1.2 million household accounts in 1991).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Chemical adopted Manufacturers Hanover's logo design and moved into its headquarters at <a href="270_Park_Avenue" title="wikilink">270 Park Avenue</a> in New York. In corporate banking, Manufacturers Hanover was better established with larger, blue-chip companies, whereas Chemical had been stronger with small- and medium-sized businesses.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Nationally, the combined Chemical bank became one of the largest lenders to U.S. companies and was the arguably the leader in loan syndications globally. Additionally, Chemical took a leading role providing foreign exchange, interest rate and currency swaps, corporate finance services, cash management, corporate and institutional trust, trade services and funds transfer. Chemical operated one of the nation's largest bank credit card franchises and was a major originator and servicer of home mortgages.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1996, Chemical acquired <a href="The_Chase_Manhattan_Corporation" title="wikilink">The Chase Manhattan Corporation</a> in a merger valued at $10 billion to create the largest financial institution in the United States. Although Chemical was the acquirer, the bank adopted the <a href="Chase_(bank)" title="wikilink">Chase</a> brand, which was considered to be better known, particularly internationally. Chase, which had been the largest bank in the U.S. had fallen to sixth, while Chemical was the third largest bank at the time of the merger.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The merger resulted in the reduction of more than 12,000 jobs between the two banks and merger related expenses of approximately $1.9 billion.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>The bank continued to operate under the Chase brand until the bank acquired <a href="J.P._Morgan_&amp;_Co." title="wikilink">J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.</a> in December 2000 to form <a href="JPMorgan_Chase_&amp;_Co." title="wikilink">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</a> Throughout all of these acquisitions, Chemical's original management team remained in charge of both the bank and its private equity investment group, JP Morgan Partners, until acquiring <a href="Bank_One" title="wikilink">Bank One</a> in 2004.</p>
<h3 id="acquisition-history">Acquisition history</h3>
<p>The following is an illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors (this is not a comprehensive list):</p>

In 1848 the bank sold its building to its neighbor <a href="Barnum&#39;s_American_Museum" title="wikilink">Barnum's American Museum</a> (the building collapsed during Barnum's subsequent remodelling) and moved to <a href="270_Broadway" title="wikilink">270 Broadway</a>. <a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>For many years, the bank was referred to as &quot;Old Bullion&quot; because of its refusal to make <a href="specie" class="uri" title="wikilink">specie</a> payments in 1857, even though all other <a href="Clearing_house_(finance)" title="wikilink">clearing house</a> banks had done so.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>The bank moved to 165 Broadway in the late 1920s<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> and was to move to <a href="277_Park_Avenue" title="wikilink">277 Park Avenue</a> in 1980.

<p>JPMorgan Chase's investment banking groups returned to <a href="277_Park_Avenue" title="wikilink">277 Park Avenue</a> in 2003 following the departure of its previous tenant but will relocate following the 2008 merger with <a href="Bear_Stearns" title="wikilink">Bear Stearns</a>.</p>
