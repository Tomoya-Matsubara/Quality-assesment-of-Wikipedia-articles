An outstanding all-rounder, he represented his country at both <a href="football_(soccer)" title="wikilink">soccer</a> and <a href="rugby_union" title="wikilink">rugby union</a>. He was also a noted <a href="sprinting" title="wikilink">sprinter</a> and <a href="long_jumper" title="wikilink">long jumper</a> and as a youth played <a href="Gaelic_football" title="wikilink">Gaelic football</a>. In his spare time he also played <a href="golf" class="uri" title="wikilink">golf</a> and <a href="tennis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tennis</a> at a decent level. O'Flanagan played soccer for among others, <a href="Bohemian_F.C." title="wikilink">Bohemians</a> and <a href="Arsenal_F.C." title="wikilink">Arsenal</a>, and as an international he played for both Ireland teams - the <a href="Ireland_national_football_team_(FAI)" title="wikilink">FAI XI</a> and the <a href="Ireland_national_football_team_(IFA)" title="wikilink">IFA XI</a>. O'Flanagan also played rugby union for <a href="University_College_Dublin" title="wikilink">UCD</a>, <a href="London_Irish" title="wikilink">London Irish</a> and <a href="Ireland_national_rugby_union_team" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>.</p>
<p>In 1946 he played rugby for <a href="Ireland_national_rugby_union_team" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> against <a href="France_national_rugby_union_team" title="wikilink">France</a> and then played soccer for the <a href="Ireland_national_football_team_(IFA)" title="wikilink">IFA XI</a> against <a href="Scotland_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Scotland</a> seven days later. His brother, <a href="Mick_O&#39;Flanagan" title="wikilink">Mick O'Flanagan</a>, was also a notable sportsman and also represented Ireland at both soccer and rugby union. On September 30 1946 both brothers played together for the <a href="Ireland_national_football_team_(FAI)" title="wikilink">FAI XI</a> against <a href="England_national_football_team" title="wikilink">England</a>. A third brother, <a href="Charlie_O&#39;Flanagan" title="wikilink">Charlie O'Flanagan</a>, also played for Bohs.</p>
<p>O'Flanagan subsequently became an <a href="Olympic_Games" title="wikilink">Olympic</a> official and served on the <a href="International_Olympic_Committee" title="wikilink">International Olympic Committee</a> from 1976 to 1994. On his retirement he was made an honorary lifetime member of IOC. He died in a Dublin hospital in 2006, at the age of 86, after being admitted for <a href="heart" class="uri" title="wikilink">heart</a> problems.</p>
<h2 id="sporting-career">Sporting career</h2>
<h3 id="early-years">Early years</h3>
<p>O'Flanagan attended the <a href="Congregation_of_Christian_Brothers" title="wikilink">Christian Brothers</a> school in Synge Street, <a href="Dublin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dublin</a> where the main sport was Gaelic football and he was subsequently included on the <a href="Dublin_GAA" title="wikilink">Dublin GAA</a> minor panel. The panel also included <a href="Johnny_Carey" title="wikilink">Johnny Carey</a> and together they also played soccer with <a href="Home_Farm_F.C." title="wikilink">Home Farm</a>. When the <a href="Gaelic_Athletic_Association" title="wikilink">Gaelic Athletic Association</a> found out, O'Flanagan, but not Carey was dropped from the panel. He continued to play soccer and joined <a href="Bohemian_F.C." title="wikilink">Bohemians</a>, making his first team debut at 16. In the summer of 1937 he played for an <a href="Ireland_national_football_team_(FAI)" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> junior team against a Birmingham FA XI at <a href="West_Bromwich" title="wikilink">West Bromwich</a> and scored twice in a 4-3 win. His performance resulted in offers from <a href="Liverpool_F.C." title="wikilink">Liverpool</a>, <a href="Aston_Villa_F.C." title="wikilink">Aston Villa</a> and <a href="Manchester_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Manchester United</a>, but his parents insisted that he complete his education.</p>
<h3 id="university-years">University years</h3>
<p>In 1937 O'Flanagan began studying medicine at <a href="University_College_Dublin" title="wikilink">University College Dublin</a> and it was while there that he developed into an all-round sportsman. He continued to play soccer for <a href="Bohemian_F.C." title="wikilink">Bohemians</a> and on November 7 1937, aged 18, he scored on his senior debut for <a href="Ireland_national_football_team_(FAI)" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> against <a href="Norway_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Norway</a>, in a qualifier for the <a href="1938_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification" title="wikilink">1938 FIFA World Cup</a>. In 1945 he also captained Bohs as they won the <a href="Dublin_and_Belfast_Intercity_Cup" title="wikilink">Dublin and Belfast Intercity Cup</a>, beating <a href="Belfast_Celtic_F.C." title="wikilink">Belfast Celtic</a> 3-2 on aggregate in the final.</p>
<p>It was while at UCD that O'Flanagan first took up rugby union, playing for the <a href="University_College_Dublin_RFC" title="wikilink">university team</a>, and in 1942 he received his first call up to the <a href="Ireland_national_rugby_union_team" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> squad. O'Flanagan also emerged as a prominent <a href="Athletics_(track_and_field)" title="wikilink">athlete</a> and was Irish long jump champion in 1939 and the 60 yards and 100 yards champion in 1941. In 1941 he tied with David Guiney for the long jump title, but with only one gold medal available, he insisted his rival accept it as he already had one. Only the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a> prevented O'Flanagan representing Ireland at a third sport.</p>
<h3 id="london-years">London years</h3>
<p>After qualifying as a doctor from <a href="University_College_Dublin" title="wikilink">UCD</a> in 1945, O'Flanagan was offered a position as a junior <a href="General_practitioner" title="wikilink">GP</a> in <a href="Ruislip" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ruislip</a>, <a href="Middlesex" class="uri" title="wikilink">Middlesex</a>. He maintained his interest in sport, however, playing soccer for <a href="Arsenal_F.C." title="wikilink">Arsenal</a> and rugby union for <a href="London_Irish" title="wikilink">London Irish</a>. Despite being good enough to play soccer as a professional, he remained an amateur so he could continue to play rugby union. In his debut season with Arsenal, <a href="1945-46_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1945-46</a>, he scored 11 goals in 18 <a href="Football_League_South" title="wikilink">Football League South</a> appearances, finishing as the club&lt;U+2019&gt;s top scorer; he also played a further two games for Arsenal in the <a href="FA_Cup" title="wikilink">FA Cup</a> in a two-legged tie against <a href="West_Ham_United_F.C." title="wikilink">West Ham United</a> that Arsenal lost 6-1 on aggregate.</p>
<p>During the <a href="1946-47_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1946-47</a> season he made 14 <a href="Football_League_First_Division" title="wikilink">First Division</a> appearances and scored 3 goals. He made his first-class league debut<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> against <a href="Blackburn_Rovers_F.C." title="wikilink">Blackburn Rovers</a> on September 4 1946. His last appearance for the Arsenal senior team came on December 28 1946 against <a href="Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C." title="wikilink">Wolves</a>. He continued to play for <a href="Arsenal_F.C._Reserves" title="wikilink">Arsenal Reserves</a> until 1948 and later played for both <a href="Barnet_F.C." title="wikilink">Barnet</a> and <a href="Brentford_F.C." title="wikilink">Brentford</a> before his increasing medical commitments and an ankle injury, forced him to retire as a sportsman in 1949. However O'Flanagan, who was now a specialist in sports medicine, had already embarked on his next career. A chance encounter with <a href="the_Football_Association" title="wikilink">FA</a> chairman <a href="Stanley_Rous" title="wikilink">Stanley Rous</a> led to his appointment to the British Olympic Medical Commission and to him becoming team doctor for <a href="Great_Britain_at_the_Olympics" title="wikilink">Great Britain</a> at the <a href="1948_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1948 Olympic Games</a>.</p>

<h3 id="soccer-international">Soccer international</h3>
<p>When O'Flanagan began his international <a href="football_(soccer)" title="wikilink">soccer</a> career in 1937 there were, in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the <a href="Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland</a> - based <a href="Irish_Football_Association" title="wikilink">IFA</a> and the <a href="Irish_Free_State" title="wikilink">Irish Free State</a> - based <a href="Football_Association_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">FAI</a> claimed jurisdiction over the whole of <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> and selected players from the whole island. As a result several notable Irish players from this era, including O'Flanagan, played for both teams.</p>
<p>Between 1937 and 1947 O'Flanagan made 10 appearances and scored 3 goals for the <a href="Ireland_national_football_team_(FAI)" title="wikilink">FAI XI</a>. He won 7 of these caps while playing for <a href="Bohemian_F.C." title="wikilink">Bohemians</a> and made his international debut against <a href="Norway_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Norway</a> on November 7 1937, in a qualifier for the <a href="1938_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification" title="wikilink">1938 FIFA World Cup</a>. O'Flanagan scored in the 3-3 draw. His team mates on the day included fellow debutant, <a href="Johnny_Carey" title="wikilink">Johnny Carey</a> and <a href="Jimmy_Dunne" title="wikilink">Jimmy Dunne</a>. The highlight of his international career came when he scored twice in a 2-2 away draw against <a href="Hungary_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Hungary</a> on May 18 1939. With Hungary 1-0 up at half-time, O'Flanagan turned the game around with two magnificent goals in the 52nd and 77th minutes. He scored the first with his left foot from twenty five yards and the second with his right foot from a similar distance. Only a very late goal denied the FAI XI victory.</p>
<p>In 1939 O'Flanagan also played twice for the <a href="League_of_Ireland_XI" title="wikilink">League of Ireland XI</a>, helping them to 2-1 victories against an <a href="Irish_League_XI" title="wikilink">Irish League XI</a> and a <a href="Scottish_League_XI" title="wikilink">Scottish League XI</a>. He won his last three caps for the FAI XI while at <a href="Arsenal_F.C." title="wikilink">Arsenal</a>. These included the game against <a href="England_national_football_team" title="wikilink">England</a> on September 30 1946 when his team mates included his brother, <a href="Mick_O&#39;Flanagan" title="wikilink">Mick O'Flanagan</a>. He made his final appearance for the FAI XI on May 4 1947 in 2-0 defeat against <a href="Portugal_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Portugal</a>. In 1946, while at <a href="Arsenal_F.C." title="wikilink">Arsenal</a>, O'Flanagan also played in two Victory internationals for the <a href="Ireland_national_football_team_(IFA)" title="wikilink">IFA XI</a>. On February 2 at <a href="Windsor_Park" title="wikilink">Windsor Park</a> he played for the IFA XI in a 3-2 defeat to <a href="Scotland_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>. Then on May 4 he helped the IFA XI defeat <a href="Wales_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Wales</a> 1-0 at <a href="Ninian_Park" title="wikilink">Ninian Park</a>.</p>
<h3 id="rugby-international">Rugby international</h3>
<p>In 1942, while playing for <a href="University_College_Dublin" title="wikilink">UCD</a>, O'Flanagan played for an <a href="Ireland_national_rugby_union_team" title="wikilink">Irish XV</a> against a <a href="British_Army_XV" title="wikilink">British Army XV</a> at <a href="Ravenhill_Stadium" title="wikilink">Ravenhill</a>. In 1946, while with <a href="London_Irish" title="wikilink">London Irish</a>, he played on the wing in an unofficial international against <a href="France_national_rugby_union_team" title="wikilink">France</a>. In 1947 he won his only official cap in a Test against <a href="Australia_national_rugby_union_team" title="wikilink">Australia</a>, a 16-3 defeat at <a href="Lansdowne_Road" title="wikilink">Lansdowne Road</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sports-administrator-and-doctor">Sports administrator and doctor</h2>
<p>O'Flanagan returned to <a href="Dublin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dublin</a> in the 1950s and established a successful practice at Upper Fitzwilliam Street. He briefly revived his soccer career with <a href="Bohemian_F.C." title="wikilink">Bohemians</a> and remained involved in sport throughout the rest of his life. During subsequent decades he served on numerous bodies and held various positions in the areas of sports and medicine. These include:</p>
