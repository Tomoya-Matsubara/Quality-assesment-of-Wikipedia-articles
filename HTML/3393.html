<p><a href="Sucrose" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sucrose</a> extracted from <a href="sugarcane" class="uri" title="wikilink">sugarcane</a> accounts for little more than 30% of the chemical energy stored in the mature plant; 35% is in the leaves and stem tips, which are left in the fields during harvest, and 35% are in the fibrous material (<a href="bagasse" class="uri" title="wikilink">bagasse</a>) left over from pressing. Most of the <a href="industrial_process" title="wikilink">industrial processing</a> of sugarcane in <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a> is done through a very integrated production chain, allowing sugar production, industrial ethanol processing, and electricity generation from byproducts.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a><a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> The typical steps for large scale production of sugar and ethanol include <a href="milling" class="uri" title="wikilink">milling</a>, <a href="electricity_generation" title="wikilink">electricity generation</a>, <a href="Fermentation_(biochemistry)" title="wikilink">fermentation</a>, <a href="distillation" class="uri" title="wikilink">distillation</a> of ethanol, and <a href="dehydration" class="uri" title="wikilink">dehydration</a>.</p>
<h4 id="milling-and-refining">Milling and refining</h4>

<p>Once harvested, sugarcane is usually transported to the plant by <a href="semi-trailer_truck" title="wikilink">semi-trailer trucks</a>. After <a href="quality_control" title="wikilink">quality control</a> sugarcane is washed, chopped, and shredded by revolving knives. The feedstock is fed to and extracted by a set of mill combinations to collect a juice, called <a href="garapa" class="uri" title="wikilink">garapa</a> in Brazil, that contain 10–15 percent sucrose, and <a href="bagasse" class="uri" title="wikilink">bagasse</a>, the fiber residue. The main objective of the milling process is to extract the largest possible amount of sucrose from the cane, and a secondary but important objective is the production of bagasse with a low moisture content as boiler fuel, as bagasse is burned for electricity generation (see below), allowing the plant to be self-sufficient in energy and to generate electricity for the local power grid.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> The cane juice or garapa is then filtered and treated by chemicals and <a href="pasteurize" title="wikilink">pasteurized</a>. Before <a href="evaporation" class="uri" title="wikilink">evaporation</a>, the juice is filtered once again, producing <a href="vinasse" class="uri" title="wikilink">vinasse</a>, a fluid rich in organic compounds. The syrup resulting from evaporation is then <a href="Precipitation_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">precipitated</a> by <a href="crystallization" class="uri" title="wikilink">crystallization</a> producing a mixture of clear crystals surrounded by <a href="molasses" class="uri" title="wikilink">molasses</a>. A <a href="centrifuge" class="uri" title="wikilink">centrifuge</a> is used to separate the sugar from molasses, and the crystals are washed by addition of steam, after which the crystals are dried by an airflow. Upon cooling, sugar crystallizes out of the syrup.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> From this point, the sugar <a href="refining" class="uri" title="wikilink">refining</a> process continues to produced different types of sugar, and the molasses continue a separate process to produce ethanol.</p>
<h4 id="fermentation-destillation-and-dehydration">Fermentation, destillation and dehydration</h4>

<p>The resulting molasses are treated to become a sterilized molasse free of impurities, ready to be fermented. In the <a href="Ethanol_fermentation" title="wikilink">fermentation</a> process sugars are transformed into ethanol by addition of <a href="yeast" class="uri" title="wikilink">yeast</a>. Fermentation time varies from four to twelve hours resulting in an alcohol content of 7 to 10 percent by total volume (<a href="degrees_Gay-Lussac" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00B0&gt;GL</a>), called fermented wine. The yeast is recovered from this wine through a centrifuge. Making use of the different boiling points the alcohol in the fermented wine is separated from the main resting solid components. The remaining product is <a href="hydrated" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydrated</a> ethanol with a concentration of 96&lt;U+00B0&gt;GL,<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> the highest concentration of ethanol that can be achieved via <a href="azeotropic" class="uri" title="wikilink">azeotropic</a><a href="distillation" class="uri" title="wikilink">distillation</a>, and by national specification can contain up to 4.9% of water by volume.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> This hydrous ethanol is the fuel used by ethanol-only and <a href="flexible-fuel_vehicle" title="wikilink">flex</a> vehicles in the country.

<h4 id="electricity-generation-from-bagasse">Electricity generation from bagasse</h4>

<p>Since the early days <a href="bagasse" class="uri" title="wikilink">bagasse</a> was burnt in the plant to provide the energy required for the industrial part of the process. Today, the Brazilian best practice uses high-pressure <a href="boiler" title="wikilink">boilers</a> that increases energy recovery, allowing most sugar-ethanol plants to be energetically self-sufficient and even sell surplus electricity to utilities.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> By 2000, the total amount of sugarcane bagasse produced per year was 50 million tons/dry basis out of more than 300 million tons of harvested sugarcane. Several authors estimated a potential power generation from the use of sugarcane bagasse ranging from 1,000 to 9,000 <a href="Megawatt" title="wikilink">MW</a>, depending on the technology used and the use of harvest trash. One utility in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo is buying more than 1% of its electricity from sugar mills, with a production capacity of 600 MW for self-use and 100 MW for sale.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> According to analysis from <a href="Frost_&amp;_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Frost &amp; Sullivan</a>, Brazil's sugarcane bagasse used for power generation has reached 3.0 <a href="Gigawatt" title="wikilink">GW</a> in 2007, and it is expected to reach 12.2 GW in 2014. The analysis also found tha sugarcane bagasse cogeneration accounts for 3% of the total Brazilian energy matrix.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> The energy is especially valuable to utilities because it is produced mainly in the dry season when hydroelectric dams are running low.</p>
<p>According to a study commissioned by the <a href="Netherlands" title="wikilink">Dutch</a> government in 2006 to evaluate the sustainability of Brazilian bioethanol &quot;<em>...there are also substantial gains possible in the efficiency of electricity use and generation: The electricity used for distillery operations has been estimated at 12.9 kWh/tonne cane, with a best available technology rate of 9.6 kWh/tonne cane . For electricity generation the efficiency could be increased from 18 kWh/tonne cane presently, to 29.1 kWh/tonne cane maximum. The production of surplus electricity could in theory be increased from 5.3 kWh/tonne cane to 19 kWh/tonne cane</em>&quot;.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>
<p>There are several improvements to the industrial processes, such as adopting a <a href="hydrolysis" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydrolysis</a> process to produce ethanol instead of surplus electricity, or the use of advanced boiler and turbine technology to increase the electricity yield, or a higher use of excess bagasse and harvest trash currently left behind in the fields, that together with various other efficiency improvements in sugarcane farming and the distribution chain have the potential to allow further efficiency increases, translating into higher yields, lower production costs, and also further improvements in the <a href="energy_balance" title="wikilink">energy balance</a> and the reduction of <a href="greenhouse_gas" title="wikilink">greenhouse gas</a> emissions.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>

<p>The countries in the <a href="Caribbean_Basin" title="wikilink">Caribbean Basin</a> import relative high quantities of Brazilian ethanol, but not much is destined for domestic consumption.

<h4 id="benefits">Benefits</h4>
<p>Ethanol produced from sugarcane provides energy that is renewable and less carbon intensive than oil. Bioethanol reduces air pollution thanks to its cleaner emissions, and also contributes to mitigate <a href="climate_change" title="wikilink">climate change</a> by reducing <a href="greenhouse_gas" title="wikilink">greenhouse gas</a> emissions. However, several environmental and social issues and concerns have been raised regarding the Brazilian ethanol program.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> Among the most controversial are the risks associated with the expansion of agricultural land and its direct or indirect impact on natural habitats, and the <a href="carbon_footprint" title="wikilink">carbon footprint</a> associated to future land use changes as ethanol production expands beyond the existing arable lands.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a><a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a><a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="energy-balance">Energy Balance</h5>

<p>One of the main concerns about bioethanol production is the <a href="energy_balance" title="wikilink">energy balance</a>, the total amount of energy input into the process compared to the energy released by burning the resulting ethanol fuel. This balance considers the full cycle of producing the fuel, as cultivation, transportation and production require energy, including the use of oil and fertilizers. A comprehensive <a href="life_cycle_assessment" title="wikilink">life cycle assessment</a> commissioned by the <a href="State_of_S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Paulo" title="wikilink">State of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo</a> found that Brazilian sugarcane based ethanol has a favorable energy balance, varying from 8.3 for average conditions to 10.2 for best practice production.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> This means that for average conditions one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 8.3 energy units from the resulting ethanol. These findings have been confirmed by other studies.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a><a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a><a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> <img src="BioethanolsCountryOfOrigin.jpg" title="fig:UK estimates for the carbon intensity of bioethanol and fossil fuels.

As shown, Brazilian ethanol from sugarcane is the most efficient biofuel currently under commercial production in terms of GHG emission reduction." /></p>
<h5 id="greenhouse-gas-emissions">Greenhouse gas emissions</h5>
<p>Another benefit of bioethanol is the reduction of <a href="greenhouse_gas" title="wikilink">greenhouse gas</a> emissions as compared to gasoline, because as much carbon dioxide is taken up by the growing plants as is produced when the bioethanol is burnt, with a zero theoretical net contribution.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a> Several studies have shown that sugarcane based ethanol reduces greenhouse gases by 86 to 90% if there is no significant land use change,<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a><a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a><a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> and ethanol from sugarcane is regarded the most efficient biofuel currently under commercial production in terms of GHG emission reduction.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a><a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> However, a study published in 2008<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a> is critical of previous assessments of greenhouse gas emissions, as the authors considered that these studies did not take into account the effect of land use changes.<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a> (see below &quot;Effects of land use change&quot;)</p>
<h5 id="air-pollution">Air pollution</h5>
<p>The widespread use of ethanol brought several environmental benefits to urban centers regarding <a href="air_pollution" title="wikilink">air pollution</a>. <a href="Lead" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lead</a> additives to gasoline were reduced through the 1980s as the amount of ethanol blended in the fuel was increased, and these additives were completely eliminated by 1991. The addition of ethanol blends instead of lead to gasoline lowered the total <a href="carbon_monoxide" title="wikilink">carbon monoxide</a> (CO), <a href="hydrocarbon" title="wikilink">hydrocarbons</a>, <a href="sulfur" class="uri" title="wikilink">sulfur</a> emissions, and <a href="particulate_matter" title="wikilink">particulate matter</a> significantly.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a> The use of ethanol-only vehicles has also reduced CO emissions drastically. Before the <em>Pr&lt;U+00F3&gt;-&lt;U+00C1&gt;lcool</em> Program started, when gasoline was the only fuel in use, CO emissions were higher than 50 g/km driven; they had been reduced to less than 5.8 g/km in 1995.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> Several studies have also shown that <a href="S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Paulo_(city)" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo</a> has benefit with significantly less air pollution thanks to ethanol's cleaner emissions.<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a> Furthermore, Brazilian <a href="flexible-fuel_vehicle" title="wikilink">flex-fuel</a> engines are being designed with higher <a href="compression_ratio" title="wikilink">compression ratios</a>, taking advantage of the higher ethanol blends and maximizing the benefits of the higher oxygen content of ethanol, resulting in lower emissions and improving fuel efficiency.<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a></small></p>
<p>Even though all automotive <a href="fossil_fuel" title="wikilink">fossil fuels</a> emit aldehydes, one of the drawbacks of the use of <a href="hydrated" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydrated</a> ethanol in ethanol-only engines is the increase in <a href="aldehyde" class="uri" title="wikilink">aldehyde</a> emissions as compared with gasoline or <a href="gasohol" class="uri" title="wikilink">gasohol</a>.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a> However, the present ambient concentrations of aldehyde, in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo city are below the reference levels recommended as adequate to human health found in the literature.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> Other concern is that because <a href="formaldehyde" class="uri" title="wikilink">formaldehyde</a> and <a href="acetaldehyde" class="uri" title="wikilink">acetaldehyde</a> emissions are significantly higher, and although both aldehydes occur naturally and are frequently found in the open environment, additional emissions may be important because of their role in smog formation.

<h5 id="water-use-and-fertilizers">Water use and fertilizers</h5>
<p>Ethanol production has also raised concerns regarding water overuse and pollution, soil erosion and possible contamination by excessive use of <a href="fertilizers" class="uri" title="wikilink">fertilizers</a>.<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a><a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a><a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a> A study commissioned by the <a href="Netherlands" title="wikilink">Dutch</a> government in 2006 to evaluate the sustainability of Brazilian bioethanol concluded that there is sufficient water to supply all foreseeable long-term water requirements for sugarcane and ethanol production. Also, and as a result of legislation and technological progress, the amount of water collected for ethanol production has decreased considerably during the previous years. The overuse of water resources seems a limited problem in general in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo, particularly because of the relatively high rainfall, yet, some local problems may occur. Regarding water pollution due to sugarcane production, <a href="Embrapa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Embrapa</a> classifies the industry as level 1, which means &lt;U+201C&gt;no impact&lt;U+201D&gt; on water quality.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a><a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a></p>
<p>This evaluation also found that consumption of agrochemicals for sugar cane production is lower than in citric, corn, coffee and soybean cropping. Disease and pest control, including the use of agrochemicals, is a crucial element in all cane production. The study found that development of resistant sugar cane varieties is a crucial aspect of disease and pest control and is one of the primary objectives of Brazil&lt;U+2019&gt;s cane genetic improvement programs. Disease control is one of the main reasons for the replacement of a commercial variety of sugar cane.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="field-burning">Field burning</h5>
<p>Advancements in fertilizers and natural pesticides have all but eliminated the need to burn fields.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a> Sugarcane fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a> There has been less burning due to pressure from the public and health authorities, and as a result of the recent development of effective harvesting machines. A 2001 state law banned burning in sugarcane fields in <a href="S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Paulo_(state)" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo</a> state by 2021,<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> and machines will gradually replace human labor as the means of harvesting cane, except where the abrupt terrain does not allow for mechanical harvesting.

<h5 id="effects-of-land-use-change">Effects of land use change</h5>
<p>A study published in 2008 questioned the benefits estimated in previous assessments regarding the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from sugarcane based ethanol, as the authors consider that these studies did not take into account the effect of land use changes.<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a><a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> The authors found a &quot;biofuel carbon debt&quot; is created when Brazil and other developing countries convert land in undisturbed ecosystems, such as <a href="rainforest" title="wikilink">rainforests</a>, <a href="savanna" title="wikilink">savannas</a>, or <a href="grassland" title="wikilink">grasslands</a>, to <a href="biofuel" class="uri" title="wikilink">biofuel</a> production, and to crop production when agricultural land is diverted to biofuel production. This land use change releases more <a href="Carbon_dioxide" title="wikilink">CO<sub>2</sub></a> than the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that these biofuels would provide by displacing fossil fuels. Among others, the study analyzed the case of Brazilian <a href="Cerrado" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cerrado</a> being converted for sugarcane ethanol production. The biofuel carbon debt on converted Cerrado is estimated to be repaid in 17 years, the least amount of time of the scenarios that were analyzed, as for example, ethanol from US <a href="maize" title="wikilink">corn</a> was estimated to have a 93 year payback time. The study conclusion is that the net effect of biofuel production via clearing of carbon-rich habitats is to increase CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for decades or centuries relative to fossil fuel use.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a></p>
<p>Regarding this concern, previous studies conducted in Brazil have shown there are 355 million ha of arable land in Brazil, of which only 72 million ha are in use.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a> Sugarcane is only taking 2% of arable land available,<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a> of which ethanol production represented 55% in 2008.<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a> Embrapa estimates that there is enough agricultural land available to increase at least 30 times the existing sugarcane plantation without endangering sensible ecosystems or taking land destined for food crops.<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a> Most future growth is expected to take place on abandoned <a href="pasture" class="uri" title="wikilink">pasture</a> lands, as it has been the historical trend in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo state.<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a><a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a><a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a><a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a> Also, productivity is expected to improve even further based on current biotechnology research, genetic improvement, and better agronomic practices, thus contributing to reduce land demand for future sugarcane cultures.<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a><a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a> This trend is demonstrated by the increases in agricultural production that took place in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo state between 1990 and 2004, where <a href="coffee" class="uri" title="wikilink">coffee</a>, <a href="orange_(fruit)" title="wikilink">orange</a>, sugarcane and other food crops were grown in an almost constant area.<a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260"><sup>260</sup></a></p>

However, &quot;<em>...the indirect impacts from an increase of the area under sugar cane production are likely more severe.

<p>Brazil's president, <a href="Luiz_In&lt;U+00E1&gt;cio_Lula_da_Silva" title="wikilink">Luiz In&lt;U+00E1&gt;cio Lula da Silva</a> has also claimed this concern is not valid.

<p>The total number of permanent employees in the sector fell by one-third between 1992 and 2003, in part due to the increasing reliance on mechanical harvesting, especially in the richest and more mature sugarcane producers of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo state. During the same period, the share of temporary or seasonal workers has fluctuated, first declining and then increasing in recent years to about one-half of the total jobs in the sector, but in absolute terms the number of temporary workers has declined also.<a href="#fn285" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref285"><sup>285</sup></a> The sugarcane sector in the poorer Northeast region is more labor intensive as production in this region represents only 18.6% of the country's total production but employs 44.3% of worker force in the sugarcane sector.<a href="#fn286" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref286"><sup>286</sup></a></p>
<p>The manual harvesting of sugarcane has been associated with hardship and poor working conditions.<a href="#fn287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref287"><sup>287</sup></a><a href="#fn288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref288"><sup>288</sup></a><a href="#fn289" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref289"><sup>289</sup></a> In this regard, the study commissioned by the Dutch government<a href="#fn290" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref290"><sup>290</sup></a> confirmed that the main problem is indeed related to manual cane harvesting. A key problem in working conditions is the high work load. As a result of mechanization the workload per worker has increased from 4 to 6 ton per day in the eighties to 8 to 10 ton per day in the nineties, up to 12 to 15 ton per day in 2007, and if the quota is not fulfill workers can be fired.<a href="#fn291" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref291"><sup>291</sup></a><a href="#fn292" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref292"><sup>292</sup></a> Producers say this problem will disappear with greater mechanization in the next decade.<a href="#fn293" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref293"><sup>293</sup></a> Also, as mechanization of the harvesting is increasing and only feasible in flat terrain, more workers are being used in areas where conditions are not suitable for mechanized harvesting equipment, such as rough areas where the crops are planted irregularly, making working conditions harder and more hazardous.<a href="#fn294" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref294"><sup>294</sup></a></p>
<p>Also unhealthy working conditions and even cases of slavery and deaths from overwork (cane cutting) have been reported,<a href="#fn295" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref295"><sup>295</sup></a> but these are likely worst-case examples.<a href="#fn296" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref296"><sup>296</sup></a> Even though sufficiently strict labor laws are present in Brazil, enforcement is weak.<a href="#fn297" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref297"><sup>297</sup></a> Displacement and seasonal labor also implies physical and cultural disruption of multifunctional family farms and traditional communities.<a href="#fn298" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref298"><sup>298</sup></a></p>
<p>Regarding <a href="social_responsibility" title="wikilink">social responsibility</a> the ethanol production sector maintains more than 600 schools, 200 nursery centers and 300 day care units, as legislation requires that 1% of the net sugar cane price and 2% of the net ethanol price must be devoted to medical, dental, pharmaceutical, sanitary, and educational services for sugar cane workers. In practice more than 90% of the mills provide health and dental care, transportation and collective life insurance, and over 80% provide meals and pharmaceutical care. However, for the temporary low wage workers in cane cutting these services may not be available. <a href="#fn299" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref299"><sup>299</sup></a></p>

The report discusses some existing problems and potential risks, and asks the Brazilian government for caution to avoid jeopardizing its environmental and social sustainability.

The study found that higher oil prices and a weak dollar explain 25-30% of total price rise. The study said that &quot;<em>...large increases in biofuels production in the United States and Europe are the main reason behind the steep rise in global food prices</em>&quot; and also stated that &quot;<em>Brazil's sugar-based ethanol did not push food prices appreciably higher</em>&quot;.<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319"><sup>319</sup></a><a href="#fn320" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref320"><sup>320</sup></a> The report argues that increased production of biofuels in these developed regions were supported by subsidies and tariffs on imports, and considers that without such policies, price increases worldwide would have been smaller. This research paper also concluded that Brazil's sugar cane based ethanol has not raised sugar prices significantly, and recommends removing tariffs on ethanol imports by both the U.S. and E.U., to allow more efficient producers such as Brazil and other developing countries, including many African countries, to produce ethanol profitably for export to meet the mandates in the <a href="E.U." class="uri" title="wikilink">E.U.</a> and <a href="U.S." class="uri" title="wikilink">U.S.</a><a href="#fn321" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref321"><sup>321</sup></a></p>

The OECD study is also critical of the limited reduction of <a href="Greenhouse_gas" title="wikilink">GHG</a> emissions achieved from biofuels produced in Europe and North America, concluding that the current biofuel support policies would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport fuel by no more than 0.8 percent by 2015, while Brazilian ethanol from sugar cane reduces greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80 percent compared to fossil fuels.
