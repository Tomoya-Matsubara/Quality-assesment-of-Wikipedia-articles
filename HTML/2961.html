<p><strong>Tiridates I</strong> (, <a href="Eastern_Armenian" title="wikilink">EA</a>: Trdat I, <a href="Western_Armenian" title="wikilink">WA</a>: Drtad I) was king of <a href="Armenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Armenia</a> beginning in 53 AD and the founder of the <a href="Arsacid_Dynasty_of_Armenia" title="wikilink">Arshakuni Dynasty</a>, the Armenian line of the <a href="Arsacid_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Arsacid Dynasty</a>. His early reign was marked by a brief interruption towards the end of the year 54 and a much longer one from 58 to 63. In an agreement to resolve the <a href="Roman_relations_with_the_Parthians_and_Sassanians#Relations_during_the_Julio-Claudian_dynasty" title="wikilink">Roman-Parthian conflict</a> in and over Armenia, Tiridates (who was the brother of <a href="Vologases_I_of_Parthia" title="wikilink">Vologases I of Parthia</a>) was crowned king of Armenia by the Roman emperor <a href="Nero" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nero</a> in 66 AD; in the future, the king of Armenia was to be a Parthian prince, but his appointment required approval from the Romans. Even though this made Armenia a <a href="Satellite_state" title="wikilink">client kingdom</a>, various contemporary Roman sources thought that Nero had <a href="de_facto" title="wikilink">de facto</a> ceded Armenia to <a href="Parthia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Parthia</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to being a king, Tiridates was also a <a href="Zoroastrianism" title="wikilink">Zoroastrian</a> priest and was accompanied by other magi with him on his journey to Rome in 66 AD. This is about the same time that the <a href="Gospel_of_Matthew" title="wikilink">Gospel of Matthew</a> recorded a journey of wise men from the east to the infant <a href="Jesus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jesus</a> in <a href="Bethlehem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bethlehem</a>. This may lay behind the later Christian legend of the <a href="Three_Magi" title="wikilink">Three Magi</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In the early 20th century, <a href="Franz_Cumont" title="wikilink">Franz Cumont</a> speculated that Tiridates was instrumental in the development of <a href="Mithraism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mithraism</a>,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> which&lt;U+2014&gt;in Cumont's view&lt;U+2014&gt;was simply Romanized Zoroastrianism. This &quot;continuity&quot; theory has since been collectively refuted.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The dates of his birth and death are unknown.</p>
<h2 id="ascension">Ascension</h2>
<p>Tiridates was the son of <a href="Vonones_II_of_Parthia" title="wikilink">Vonones II of Parthia</a> and a <a href="Ancient_Greeks" title="wikilink">Greek</a> <a href="concubine" class="uri" title="wikilink">concubine</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Virtually nothing is known about his minority and youth, which he spent in Media, where his father was governor under the reign of his brother <a href="Gotarzes_II" title="wikilink">Gotarzes II</a>.

Rhadamistus had killed his uncle Mithridates who was the legitimate king of Armenia by luring the Roman garrison that was protecting him outside of the fortress of <a href="Garni" title="wikilink">Gornea</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <img src="382px-Baudry-Vestale_.gif" title="fig:Zenobia found.

Syrian governor Ummidius Quadratus sent Helvidius Priscus with a legion to repair these outrages; he was recalled so as not to provoke a war with Parthia.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In 52, King <a href="Vologases_I" title="wikilink">Vologases I</a> (Vagharshak in Armenian) of <a href="Parthia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Parthia</a> took the opportunity and invaded Armenia, conquering <a href="Artaxata" class="uri" title="wikilink">Artaxata</a> (<em>Artashat</em> in Armenia) and proclaiming his younger brother Tiridates as king.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> This action violated the treaty that had been signed by the Roman emperor <a href="Augustus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Augustus</a> and Parthian king <a href="Phraates_IV" title="wikilink">Phraates IV</a> which gave the Romans the explicit right to appoint and crown the kings of Armenia.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Vologases considered the throne of Armenia to have been once the property of his ancestors, now usurped by a foreign monarch in virtue of a crime.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> A winter epidemic as well as an insurrection initiated by his son <a href="Vardanes_II_of_Parthia" title="wikilink">Vardanes</a> forced him to withdraw his troops from Armenia, allowing Rhadamistus to come back and punish locals as traitors; they eventually revolted and replaced him with the Parthian prince Tiridates in early 55.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Rhadamistus escaped along with his wife Zenobia who was pregnant. Unable to continue fleeing, she asked her husband to end her life rather than be captured. Rhadamistus stabbed her with a Median dagger and flung her body into the river <a href="Araxes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Araxes</a>. Zenobia was not fatally injured and was recovered by shepherds who sent her to Tiridates. Tiridates received her kindly and treated her as a member of the monarchy.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Rhadamistus himself returned to Iberia and was soon put to death by his father <a href="Pharsman_I_of_Iberia" title="wikilink">Parasmanes I</a> of Iberia for having plotted against the royal power.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="war-with-rome">War with Rome</h2>
<p>Unhappy with the growing <a href="Parthia" title="wikilink">Parthian</a> influence at their doorstep,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Roman Emperor Nero sent General <a href="Gnaeus_Domitius_Corbulo" title="wikilink">Corbulo</a> with a large army to the east in order to restore Roman client kings.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> A <a href="Hasmonean" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hasmonean</a> named Aristobul was given <a href="Lesser_Armenia" title="wikilink">Lesser Armenia</a> (<a href="Nicopolis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nicopolis</a> and <a href="Satala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Satala</a>), Gaius Julius Sohaemus of the <a href="Royal_Family_of_Emesa" title="wikilink">house of Emessa</a> received <a href="Sophene" title="wikilink">Armenia Sophene</a>. In the spring of 58, Corbulo entered Greater Armenia from Cappadocia and advanced towards Artaxata, while Parasmanes I of Iberia attacked from the north, and <a href="Antiochus_IV_of_Commagene" title="wikilink">Antiochus IV of Commagene</a> attacked from the southwest. Supported by his brother, Tiridates sent flying columns to raid the Romans far and wide. Corbulo retaliated using the same tactics and the use of the <a href="Moschoi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moschoi</a> tribes who raided outlying regions of Armenia.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Tiridates fled from the capital, and Corbulo burned Artaxata to the ground. In the summer, Corbulo began moving towards <a href="Tigranocerta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tigranocerta</a> through rough terrain and passing through the Taronitida (Taron), where several of his commanders died in an ambush by the Armenian resistance; however, the city opened its doors, with the exception of one of the citadels, which was destroyed in the ensuing assault.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> By this time the majority of Armenians had abandoned resistance and accepted the prince favored by Rome.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Nero gave the crown to the last royal descendant of the <a href="List_of_Kings_of_Cappadocia" title="wikilink">Kings of Cappadocia</a>, the grandson of <a href="Glaphyra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glaphyra</a> (daughter of <a href="Archelaus_of_Cappadocia" title="wikilink">Archelaus of Cappadocia</a>) and Alexander of <a href="Judea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Judea</a> (the brother of <a href="Herod_Archelaus" title="wikilink">Herod Archelaus</a> and the son of <a href="Herod_the_Great" title="wikilink">Herod the Great</a>),<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> who assumed the Armenian name <a href="Tigranes_VI" title="wikilink">Tigranes</a> (his uncle was <a href="Tigranes_V" title="wikilink">Tigranes V</a>).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> His son, named Alexander, married <a href="Iotapa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iotapa</a>, the daughter of <a href="Antiochus_IV_of_Commagene" title="wikilink">Antiochus IV of Commagene</a> and was made King of Cilicia. Nero was hailed vigorously in public for this initial victory<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and Corbulo was appointed governor of Syria as a reward.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> A guard of 1000 legionary soldiers, three auxiliary cohorts and two wings of horses were allotted to Tigranes in order to defend the country.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Border districts were bestowed to Roman allies that assisted Corbulo including <a href="Polemon_(Cilicia)" title="wikilink">Polemon</a>, Parasmanes, <a href="Aristobulus_of_Chalcis" title="wikilink">Aristobolus</a> and Antiochus.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Vologases was infuriated by the fact that an alien now sat on the Armenian throne but hesitated to reinstate his brother as he was engaged in a conflict with the <a href="Hyrcania" title="wikilink">Hyrcanians</a> who were revolting.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Tigranes invaded the Kingdom of <a href="Adiabene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adiabene</a> and deposed its King Monobazes in 61, who was a vassal of Parthians.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Vologases considered this an act of aggression from Rome and started a campaign to restore Tiridates to the Armenian throne. He placed under the command of <a href="spahbod" class="uri" title="wikilink">spahbod</a> Moneses a well-disciplined force of <a href="cataphracts" class="uri" title="wikilink">cataphracts</a> along with Adiabenian auxiliaries and ordered him to expel Tigranes from Armenia. Having quelled the Hyrcanian revolt, Vologases gathered the strength of his dominions and embarked toward Armenia.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Corbulo having been informed of the impending attack, sent two legions under the commands of Verulanus Severus and Vettius Bolanus to the assistance of Tigranes with secret directions that they should act with caution rather than vigour. He also dispatches a message to Nero, urging him to send a second commander with the explicit purpose of defending Armenia as Syria was now also in peril. Corbulo placed the remainder of the legions on the banks of the <a href="Euphrates" class="uri" title="wikilink">Euphrates</a> and armed irregular troops of the nearby provinces. Since the region was deficient in water, he erected forts over the fountains and concealed the rivulets by heaping sand over them.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Moneses marched towards Tigranocerta but failed to break the defense of the city walls as his troops were unfit for a long siege. Corbulo, although eminently successful thought it prudent to use his good fortune with moderation. He sent a Roman centurion by the name of Casperius to the camp of Vologases in Nisibis located  from Tigranocerta with the demand to raise the siege. Because of a recent locust storm and the scarcity of fodder for his horses Vologases agreed to raise the siege of Tigranocerta and petitioned to be granted Armenia in order to achieve a firm peace.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Vologases demanded that both the Roman and Parthian troops should evacuate Armenia, that Tigranes should be dethroned, and that the position of Tiridates be recognized. The Roman government declined to accede to these arrangements and sent Lucius Caesennius Paetus, governor of Cappadocia, to settle the question by bringing Armenia under direct Roman administration.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Paetus was an incapable commander and suffered a humiliating defeat at the <a href="Battle_of_Rhandeia" title="wikilink">Battle of Rhandeia</a> in 62, losing the legions of <a href="Legio_XII_Fulminata" title="wikilink">XII <em>Fulminata</em></a> commanded by Calvisius Sabinus and <a href="Legio_IV_Scythica" title="wikilink">IIII <em>Scythica</em></a> commanded by Funisulanus Vettonianus. The command of the troops was returned to Corbulo, who the following year led a strong army into <a href="Melitene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Melitene</a> and beyond into Armenia, eliminating all of the regional governors he suspected were pro-Parthian. Finally in Rhandeia, Corbulo and Tiridates met to make a peace agreement. The location of Rhandeia suited both Tiridates and Corbulo. It appealed to Tiridates because that is where his army had beaten the Romans and sent them away under a capitulation; on the other hand, it appealed to Corbulo because he was about to wipe out the ill repute earned before in the same location. When Tiridates arrived at the Roman camp he took off his royal diadem and placed it on the ground near a statue of Nero, agreeing to receive it back only from Nero in Rome.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Tiridates was recognized as the vassal king of Armenia; a Roman garrison would remain in the country permanently, in Sophene while Artaxata would be reconstructed. Corbulo left his son-in-law Annius Vinicianus to accompany Tiridates to Rome in order to attest his own fidelity to Nero.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="visiting-rome">Visiting Rome</h2>
<p>Prior to embarking for Rome, Tiridates visited his mother and two brothers in <a href="Media_Atropatene" title="wikilink">Media Atropatene</a> and Parthia. On his long trek he was accompanied by his family and an imposing retinue, comprised of many feudal lords and 3,000 horsemen. His route lay across <a href="Thrace" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thrace</a>, through <a href="Illyria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Illyria</a>, on the eastern shores of the <a href="Adriatic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adriatic</a> and <a href="Picenum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Picenum</a>, in northeastern <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>. The journey took nine months, and Tiridates rode on horseback, with his children and queen at his side.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The children of Vologases, Monobazes and Pacorus also accompanied Tiridates.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Dio_Cassius" title="wikilink">Dio Cassius</a>, a second-century Roman historian, described Tiridates favorably at the time of his arrival: &quot;Tiridates himself was in the prime of his life, a notable figure by reason of his youth, beauty, family, and intelligence.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Nero greeted Tiridates at Neapolis (<a href="Naples" class="uri" title="wikilink">Naples</a>) in October, sending a state chariot to carry the visitor over the last few miles. No one was allowed to approach the emperor armed, but Tiridates maintained his dignity by refusing to remove his sword as he approached the ruler of the Roman Empire (though as a compromise, he agreed to have his sword firmly fastened in the sheath, so that it could not be drawn). At Puteolis (modern <a href="Pozzuoli" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pozzuoli</a>, near Naples) Nero ordered athletic games to be staged in honor of his guest. The Armenian king himself had an opportunity to display his ability as a marksman by shooting an arrow through the bodies of two buffaloes. The event at Puteolis also marked the first attested appearance of <a href="female_gladiator" title="wikilink">female gladiators</a>:</p>

<p>The climax of the ceremonies was reserved for the capital. Rome was profusely decorated with flags, torches, garlands and bunting, and was gorgeously illuminated at night with great crowds of people seen everywhere.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> <img src="Trdatrome.gif" title="fig:Marble statue of Tiridates erected in Rome in honor of his visit. Louvre Museum." alt="Marble statue of Tiridates erected in Rome in honor of his visit. Louvre Museum." width="150" /> On the day after Tiridates' arrival, Nero came to the <a href="Roman_Forum" title="wikilink">Forum</a> clothed in triumphal vestments and surrounded by dignitaries and soldiers, all resplendent in expensive attire and glittering armor. While Nero sat on the imperial throne, Tiridates and his retinue advanced between two lines of soldiers. Arriving in front of the <a href="dais" class="uri" title="wikilink">dais</a>, Tiridates knelt, with hands clasped on his breast. After the thundering shouts and acclamations excited by this spectacle had subsided, Tiridates addressed the emperor:</p>

<p>To which Nero replied:</p>

<p>Tiridates then mounted the steps of the platform and knelt, while Nero placed the royal diadem on his head. As the young king was about to kneel a second time, Nero lifted him by his right hand and after kissing him, made him sit at his side on a chair a little lower than his own. Meanwhile, the populace gave tumultuous ovations to both rulers. A <a href="Praetor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Praetor</a>, speaking to the audience, interpreted and explained the words of Tiridates, who spoke in Greek.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> According to <a href="Pliny_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Pliny the Elder</a>, Tiridates then introduced Nero to magian feasts (<em>magicis cenis</em>).<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> <a href="Tacitus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tacitus</a> claimed that Tiridates was also interested in all things Roman.</p>
<p>Public festivities continued for some time after the coronation ceremony. The interior of the <a href="Theatre_of_Pompey" title="wikilink">Theatre of Pompey</a> and every piece of its furniture was entirely gilded for the occasion; for this reason, Rome thenceforth recalled that date as &quot;the Golden Day.&quot; Daytime festivities were on a scale no less lavish than those of the night: Royal purple awnings stretched as protection against the heat of the sun. Nero, clad in green and wearing a chariot driver's headdress, took part in a <a href="chariot_race" title="wikilink">chariot race</a>. At the evening banquets, Nero, in gold-embroidered vestments, sang and played the lyre with <a href="zither" class="uri" title="wikilink">zither</a> accompaniment. Tiridates was amazed and disgusted by Nero's extravagance, but he had only praise for Corbulo and expressed to Corbulo his surprise at his serving such a master.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> He made no concealment of his views to Nero's face and said to him sarcastically: &quot;Sire, you have a wonderful servant in the person of Corbulo.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>In memory of these events, the Senate honored Nero with the laurel wreath and the title of <a href="Imperator" class="uri" title="wikilink">Imperator</a>, or commander-in-chief of the armies. No reception comparable to this in magnitude and splendor is recorded in the history of Rome. Besides the enormous sum spent in festivities, the Roman Government bore the entire cost of the journey of Tiridates and his retinue, both from and to their homeland. Nero also made a gift to Tiridates of fifty million <a href="sesterces" class="uri" title="wikilink">sesterces</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>On his journey back to Armenia, Tiridates viewed an exhibition of <a href="pancratium" class="uri" title="wikilink">pancratium</a>. When seeing that one of the contestants fell on his back and was being beaten by his opponents, Tiridates saw exclaimed: &quot;That's an unfair contest. It isn't fair that a man who has fallen should be beaten.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Later, Nero summoned the Parthian King Vologases to Rome several times, but when the invitations became burdensome to Vologases, he sent back a dispatch to this effect: &quot;It is far easier for you than for me to traverse so great a body of water. Therefore, if you will come to Asia, we can then arrange to meet each other.&quot;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="fragile-peace">Fragile peace</h2>
<p><img src="Trdatgreek.gif" title="fig:Greek inscription attributed to Tiridates I on basalt rock from Garni." alt="Greek inscription attributed to Tiridates I on basalt rock from Garni." width="150" />Peace prevailed at this time throughout the Roman Empire. Nero therefore closed the gates of the <a href="Temple_of_Janus_(Roman_Forum)" title="wikilink">Temple of Janus</a>, which were never shut save in times of universal peace. When Tiridates returned to Armenia, he took with him a great number of skilled artisans for the reconstruction of Artaxata. He renamed the capital Neronia in honor of the emperor;<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> he embellished the royal residence at <a href="Garni" class="uri" title="wikilink">Garni</a>,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> nearby, with colonnades and monuments of dazzling richness and also the addition of a new temple. Trade between the two continents also grew, allowing Armenia to secure its independence from Rome.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Rome now counted upon Armenia as a loyal ally, even after Nero's death and through the entire duration of <a href="Vespasian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vespasian</a>'s rule in the East. Peace was a considerable victory for Nero politically.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> <img src="Nero_closedJanus.jpg" title="fig:Roman coin struck in 66 AD under Nero&#39;s reign depicting the gates of the Temple of Janus closed." alt="Roman coin struck in 66 AD under Nero&#39;s reign depicting the gates of the Temple of Janus closed." /> The immediate divident of the peace was Rome's ability to turn its full attention to the mounting problems at Judea, which broke into open warfare culminating in the <a href="First_Jewish-Roman_War" title="wikilink">First Jewish-Roman War</a> just one year after Tiridates' coronation. Large numbers of legions were diverted to Judea from Syria, which would otherwise have been impossible.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Nero became very popular in the eastern provinces of Rome and with the Armenians and Parthians. The name of <a href="Legio_XII_Fulminata" title="wikilink">Legio XII Fulminata</a> discovered carved on a mountain in <a href="Gobustan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gobustan</a> (in modern <a href="Azerbaijan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azerbaijan</a>), attests to the presence of Roman soldiers by the shores of the <a href="Caspian_Sea" title="wikilink">Caspian Sea</a> in 89 AD, farther east than any previously known Roman inscription.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The peace between Parthia and Rome lasted 50 years, until emperor <a href="Trajan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trajan</a> invaded Armenia in 114.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="war-with-alans-and-aftermath">War with Alans and aftermath</h2>
<p>In 72 the <a href="Alans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alans</a>, a warlike nomadic <a href="Sarmatian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sarmatian</a> tribe, made an incursion into Media Atropatene as well as various districts of northern Armenia. Tiridates and his brother <a href="Pacorus_II_of_Parthia" title="wikilink">Pacorus</a>, King of Media Atropatene, faced them at a number of battles, during one of which Tiridates was briefly captured, narrowly escaping being taken alive. He was lassoed from a distance and caught, but he quickly managed to whip out his sword and slash the rope in time. The Alans withdrew with a lot of booty after plundering Armenia and Media Atropatene.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The king of Iberia asked for protection against the Alans from <a href="Vespasian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vespasian</a>, who helped reconstruct the fortress of <a href="Harmozica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harmozica</a> around the Iberian capital <a href="Mtskheta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mtskheta</a>, near modern <a href="Tbilisi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tbilisi</a>. An <a href="Aramaic_alphabet" title="wikilink">Aramaic</a> inscription found near Tbilisi indicates that Tiridates also warred with Iberia during his final years.
