<p><strong>Medieval <a href="cuisine" class="uri" title="wikilink">cuisine</a></strong> refers to the <a href="food" title="wikilink">foods</a>, <a href="table_manners" title="wikilink">eating habits</a>, and <a href="cooking" class="uri" title="wikilink">cooking</a> methods of various <a href="Culture_of_Europe" title="wikilink">European cultures</a> during the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a>, a period roughly dating from the <a href="5th_century" title="wikilink">5th</a> to the <a href="16th_century" title="wikilink">16th century</a>. During this period, <a href="diet_(nutrition)" title="wikilink">diets</a> and cooking changed across Europe, and these changes helped lay the foundations for modern <a href="European_cuisine" title="wikilink">European cuisine</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Bread" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bread</a> was the <a href="staple_food" title="wikilink">staple</a>, followed by other foods made from <a href="cereal" title="wikilink">cereals</a>, such as <a href="porridge" class="uri" title="wikilink">porridge</a> and <a href="pasta" class="uri" title="wikilink">pasta</a>. <a href="Meat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Meat</a> was more prestigious and more expensive than grain or <a href="vegetable" title="wikilink">vegetables</a>. Common <a href="seasoning" title="wikilink">seasonings</a> included <a href="verjuice" class="uri" title="wikilink">verjuice</a>, <a href="wine" class="uri" title="wikilink">wine</a> and <a href="vinegar" class="uri" title="wikilink">vinegar</a>. These, along with the widespread use of <a href="honey" class="uri" title="wikilink">honey</a> or <a href="sugar" class="uri" title="wikilink">sugar</a> (among those who could afford it), gave many dishes a <a href="sweet_and_sour" title="wikilink">sweet-sour</a> flavor. The most popular types of meat were <a href="pork" class="uri" title="wikilink">pork</a> and <a href="chicken_(food)" title="wikilink">chicken</a>, while <a href="beef" class="uri" title="wikilink">beef</a>, which required greater investment in land, was less common. <a href="Cod" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cod</a> and <a href="herring" class="uri" title="wikilink">herring</a> were mainstays among the northern population, but a wide variety of other saltwater and freshwater <a href="fish_(food)" title="wikilink">fish</a> were also eaten. <a href="Almond" title="wikilink">Almonds</a>, both sweet and bitter, were eaten whole as <a href="garnish_(food)" title="wikilink">garnish</a>, or more commonly ground up and used as a <a href="thickening_agent" title="wikilink">thickener</a> in <a href="soup" title="wikilink">soups</a>, <a href="stew" title="wikilink">stews</a>, and <a href="sauce" title="wikilink">sauces</a>. Particularly popular was <a href="almond_milk" title="wikilink">almond milk</a>, which was a common substitute for animal <a href="milk" class="uri" title="wikilink">milk</a> during <a href="Lent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lent</a> and <a href="Fasting_and_Abstinence_in_the_Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">fasts</a>.</p>
<p>Slow transportation and inefficient <a href="food_preservation" title="wikilink">food preservation</a> techniques prevented long-distance <a href="trade" class="uri" title="wikilink">trade</a> of many foods. For the most part, only the wealthy, especially the <a href="nobility" class="uri" title="wikilink">nobility</a>, could afford imported ingredients such as <a href="spice" title="wikilink">spices</a>, so their cuisine was more prone to foreign influence than the cuisine of poorer people. As each level of society imitated the one above it, innovations from international trade and foreign wars gradually disseminated through the upper middle class of medieval towns.</p>
<p>In a time when <a href="famine" class="uri" title="wikilink">famine</a> was commonplace and social hierarchies were often brutally enforced, food was an important marker of social status in a way that has no equivalent today in most industrialized nations. Aside from economic unavailability of luxuries such as spices, decrees outlawed consumption of certain foods among certain social classes, and <a href="sumptuary_law" title="wikilink">sumptuary laws</a> limited the <a href="conspicuous_consumption" title="wikilink">conspicuous consumption</a> among the <a href="nouveau_riche" title="wikilink">nouveau riche</a> who were not nobility. <a href="norm_(sociology)" title="wikilink">Social norms</a> also dictated that the food of the <a href="working_class" title="wikilink">working class</a> be less refined, since it was believed there was a divine or natural resemblance between one's labor and one's food, so manual labor required coarser, cheaper food. Contemporary medicine similarly recommended expensive tonics, <a href="theriac" title="wikilink">theriacs</a>, and exotic spices for the maladies of the nobility, while relegating the more odorous, lower-ranked <a href="garlic" class="uri" title="wikilink">garlic</a> to commoners.</p>

<p>There were typically two meals a day: <a href="dinner" class="uri" title="wikilink">dinner</a> at mid-day and a lighter <a href="supper" class="uri" title="wikilink">supper</a> in the evening. <a href="Morality" title="wikilink">Moralists</a> frowned on breaking the overnight fast too early, and members of the church and cultivated <a href="gentry" class="uri" title="wikilink">gentry</a> avoided it. For practical reasons, <a href="breakfast" class="uri" title="wikilink">breakfast</a> was still eaten by most working men, and was tolerated for young children, women, the elderly and the sick. Because the church preached against <a href="gluttony" class="uri" title="wikilink">gluttony</a> and other weaknesses of the flesh, men tended to be ashamed of the weak practicality of breakfast. Lavish dinner <a href="banquet" title="wikilink">banquets</a> and late-night <em>reresopers</em> (from <a href="Occitan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Occitan</a> <em>r&lt;U+00E8&gt;ire-sopar</em>, late supper) with considerable amounts of <a href="alcoholic_beverage" title="wikilink">alcoholic beverage</a> were considered immoral. The latter were especially associated with the vices of <a href="gambling" class="uri" title="wikilink">gambling</a>, crude language, <a href="drunkenness" class="uri" title="wikilink">drunkenness</a>, and lewd behavior. Minor meals and <a href="snack_food" title="wikilink">snacks</a> were common (although also disliked by the church), and working men commonly received an allowance from their employers in order to buy <em>nuncheons</em>, small morsels to be eaten during breaks.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="etiquette">Etiquette</h3>
<p>There was an increasing trend throughout the Middle Ages to escape the stern <a href="collectivism" class="uri" title="wikilink">collectivism</a> that permeated the entire period. Otherwise the medieval meal was a communal affair, like every other part of life. The entire household, including servants, would ideally dine together. To sneak off to enjoy private company was considered a haughty and inefficient <a href="egotism" class="uri" title="wikilink">egotism</a> in a world where people depended very much on each other. In the 13th century, English <a href="Bishop_of_Lincoln" title="wikilink">bishop</a> <a href="Robert_Grosseteste" title="wikilink">Robert Grosseteste</a> advised the <a href="Earl_of_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Countess of Lincoln</a>: &quot;forbid dinners and suppers out of hall, in secret and in private rooms, for from this arises waste and no honour to the lord and lady.&quot; He also recommended to watch that the servants not make off with leftovers to make merry at rere-suppers, rather than giving it as <a href="alms" class="uri" title="wikilink">alms</a>. Although there are descriptions of dining etiquette on special occasions, less is known about the details of day to day meals of the elite or about the table manners of the common people and the destitute. However, it can be assumed there were no such extravagant luxuries as <a href="Meal#A_multicourse_meal" title="wikilink">multiple courses</a>, luxurious spices or hand-washing in scented water.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Things were different for the wealthy. Before the meal and between courses, shallow basins and linen <a href="towel" title="wikilink">towels</a> were offered to guests so they could wash their hands, as cleanliness was emphasized. Social codes made it difficult for women to uphold the stereotype of being neat, delicate and immaculate while enjoying a sumptuous feast, so the wife of the host often dined in private with her entourage. She could then join dinner only after the potentially messy business of eating was done. Overall, fine dining was a predominantly male affair, and it was uncommon for anyone but the most honored of guests to bring his wife or her <a href="lady-in-waiting" title="wikilink">ladies-in-waiting</a>. The hierarchical nature of society was reinforced by <a href="etiquette" class="uri" title="wikilink">etiquette</a> where the lower ranked were expected to help the higher, the younger to assist the elder, and men to spare women the risk of sullying dress and reputation by having to handle food in an unwomanly fashion. Shared drinking cups were common even at lavish banquets for all but those who sat at the <a href="dais" title="wikilink">high table</a>, as was the standard etiquette of breaking bread and carving meat for one's fellow diners.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Food was mostly served on <a href="plate_(dishware)" title="wikilink">plates</a> or in stew pots, and diners would take their share from the dishes and place it on <a href="trencher_(tableware)" title="wikilink">trenchers</a> of stale bread, wood or <a href="pewter" class="uri" title="wikilink">pewter</a> with the help of <a href="spoon" title="wikilink">spoons</a> or bare hands. In lower-class households it was common to eat food straight off the table. <a href="Knife" title="wikilink">Knives</a> were used at the table, but most people were expected to bring their own, and only highly favored guests would be given a personal knife. A knife was usually shared with at least one other dinner guest, unless one was of very high rank or well-acquainted with the host. <a href="Fork" title="wikilink">Forks</a> for eating were not in widespread usage in Europe until the <a href="Early_modern_Europe" title="wikilink">early modern period</a>, and early on were limited to Italy. Still, it was not until the 14th century that the fork became common among Italians of all social classes. The change in attitudes can be illustrated by the reactions to the table manners of the <a href="Byzantine_Empire" title="wikilink">Byzantine</a> princess <a href="Teodora_Anna_Dukaina_Selvo" title="wikilink">Theodora Doukaina</a> in the late 11th century. She was the future wife of the <a href="Doge_of_Venice" title="wikilink">Doge of Venice</a>, <a href="Domenico_Selvo" title="wikilink">Domenico Selvo</a>, and caused considerable dismay among upstanding Venetians. The foreign consort's insistence on having her food cut up by her <a href="eunuch" class="uri" title="wikilink">eunuch</a> servants and then eating the pieces with a golden fork shocked and upset the diners so much that the <a href="Bishop_of_Ostia" title="wikilink">Bishop of Ostia</a> later interpreted her refined foreign manners as <a href="pride" class="uri" title="wikilink">pride</a> and referred to her as &quot;...the Venetian Doge's wife, whose body, after her excessive delicacy, entirely rotted away.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>All types of cooking involved the direct use of fire. <a href="Stove" title="wikilink">Stoves</a> did not appear until the 18th century, and cooks had to know how to cook directly over an open fire. <a href="Oven" title="wikilink">Ovens</a> were used, but they were expensive to construct and only existed in fairly large households and <a href="baker" title="wikilink">bakeries</a>. It was common for a <a href="medieval_commune" title="wikilink">community</a> to have shared ownership of an oven to ensure that the bread baking essential to everyone was made communal rather than private. There were also portable ovens designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals, and even larger ones on wheels that were used to sell <a href="pie" title="wikilink">pies</a> in the streets of medieval towns. But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices, making <a href="potage" title="wikilink">potages</a> and <a href="stew" title="wikilink">stews</a> the most common dishes.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high <a href="fat" class="uri" title="wikilink">fat</a> content, or at least when fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil and a greater acceptance of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout <a href="asceticism" title="wikilink">ascetics</a>, were thin.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Fruit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fruit</a> was readily combined with meat, fish and <a href="egg_(food)" title="wikilink">eggs</a>. The recipe for <em>Tart de brymlent</em>, a fish pie from the recipe collection <em><a href="Forme_of_Cury" title="wikilink">Forme of Cury</a></em>, includes a mix of <a href="fig" title="wikilink">figs</a>, <a href="raisin" title="wikilink">raisins</a>, <a href="apple" title="wikilink">apples</a> and <a href="pear" title="wikilink">pears</a> with fish (<a href="salmon" class="uri" title="wikilink">salmon</a>, codling or <a href="haddock" class="uri" title="wikilink">haddock</a>) and pitted damson <a href="plum" title="wikilink">plums</a> under the top crust.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> It was more important to make sure that the dish agreed with contemporary standards of <a href="medieval_medicine" title="wikilink">medicine</a> and <a href="dietitian" title="wikilink">dietetics</a>. This meant that food had to be &quot;tempered&quot; according to its nature by an appropriate combination of preparation and mixing certain ingredients, <a href="condiment" title="wikilink">condiments</a> and spices. For example, fish was considered to be quite cold and moist, and best cooked in a way that heated and dried it, such as <a href="frying" class="uri" title="wikilink">frying</a> or oven baking, and seasoned with hot and dry spices; <a href="beef" class="uri" title="wikilink">beef</a> was dry and hot and should therefore be <a href="boiling" title="wikilink">boiled</a>; pork was hot and moist and should therefore always be <a href="roasting" title="wikilink">roasted</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In some <a href="recipe" class="uri" title="wikilink">recipe</a> collections, alternative ingredients were assigned with more consideration to the <a href="humours" title="wikilink">humoral</a> nature than similarity in taste. In a recipe for <a href="quince" class="uri" title="wikilink">quince</a> pie, <a href="cabbage" class="uri" title="wikilink">cabbage</a> is given as working equally well, and in another <a href="turnip" title="wikilink">turnips</a> are considered to be the equivalent of pears.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Decameron_1432-cooking_on_spit.jpg" title="fig:Fowl roasting on a spit. Under the spit is a narrow, shallow basin to collect the drippings for use in sauces or for basting the meat; illustration from The Decameron, Flanders, 1432." alt="Fowl roasting on a spit. Under the spit is a narrow, shallow basin to collect the drippings for use in sauces or for basting the meat; illustration from The Decameron, Flanders, 1432." width="200" /> In most households, cooking was done on an open <a href="hearth" class="uri" title="wikilink">hearth</a> in the middle of the main living area, to make efficient use of the heat. This was the most common arrangement, even in wealthy households, for most of the Middle Ages, where the kitchen was combined with the dining hall. Towards the <a href="Late_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Late Middle Ages</a> a separate <a href="kitchen" class="uri" title="wikilink">kitchen</a> area began to evolve. The first step was to move the fireplaces towards the walls of the main hall, and later to build a separate building or wing that contained a dedicated kitchen area, often separated from the main building by a covered <a href="arcade_(architecture)" title="wikilink">arcade</a>. This way, the smoke, odors and bustle of the kitchen could be kept out of sight of guests, and the fire risk lessened.</p>
<p>Many basic variations of cooking utensils available today, such as <a href="frying_pan" title="wikilink">frying pans</a>, <a href="cookware_and_bakeware" title="wikilink">pots</a>, <a href="kettle" title="wikilink">kettles</a>, and <a href="waffle_iron" title="wikilink">waffle irons</a>, already existed, even if they were often too expensive for poorer households. Other tools more specific to cooking over an open fire were <a href="spit_(cooking_aide)" title="wikilink">spits</a> of various sizes, and material for skewering anything from delicate <a href="quail" title="wikilink">quails</a> to whole <a href="Cattle#Ox" title="wikilink">oxen</a>. There were also cranes with adjustable hooks so that pots and <a href="cauldron" title="wikilink">cauldrons</a> could easily be swung away from the fire to keep them from burning or boiling over. Utensils were often held directly over the fire or placed into embers on <a href="tripod" title="wikilink">tripods</a>. To assist the cook there were also assorted knives, stirring spoons, <a href="ladle_(spoon)" title="wikilink">ladles</a> and <a href="grater" title="wikilink">graters</a>. In wealthy households one of the most common tools was the <a href="mortar_and_pestle" title="wikilink">mortar</a> and <a href="sieve" class="uri" title="wikilink">sieve</a> cloth, since many medieval recipes called for food to be finely chopped, mashed, strained and seasoned either before or after cooking. This was based on a belief among physicians that the finer the consistency of food, the more effectively the body would absorb the nourishment. It also gave skilled cooks the opportunity to elaborately shape the results. A typical procedure was to skin and <a href="Game_(food)#Game_preparation" title="wikilink">dress</a> an animal, grind up the meat and mix it with spices and other ingredients and return it into its own skin, or mold it into the shape of a completely different animal.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The kitchen staff of huge noble or royal courts occasionally numbered in the hundreds: <a href="panter" title="wikilink">pantlers</a>, bakers, <a href="wafer" title="wikilink">waferers</a>, sauciers, <a href="larder" title="wikilink">larderers</a>, <a href="butcher" title="wikilink">butchers</a>, carvers, page boys, milk maids, butlers and countless <a href="scullion" title="wikilink">scullions</a>. While an average peasant household often made do with firewood collected from the surrounding woodlands, the major kitchens of households had to cope with the logistics of daily providing at least two meals for several hundred people. Guidelines on how to prepare for a two-day banquet can be found in the 15th-century cookbook <em><a href="Du_fait_de_cuisine" title="wikilink">Du fait de cuisine</a></em> (&quot;On cookery&quot;) by <a href="Chiquart" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chiquart</a>, master chef of <a href="Amadeus_VIII,_Duke_of_Savoy" title="wikilink">Amadeus VIII</a>, <a href="Duke_of_Savoy" title="wikilink">Duke of Savoy</a>. Chiquart recommends that the chief cook should have at hand at least 1,000 cartloads of &quot;good, dry firewood&quot; and a large <em>barnful</em> of coal.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="preservation">Preservation</h3>
<p>Food preservation methods were basically the same as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of <a href="canning" class="uri" title="wikilink">canning</a> in the early <a href="19th_century" title="wikilink">19th century</a>. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove <a href="moisture" class="uri" title="wikilink">moisture</a>, thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent <a href="microorganism" title="wikilink">microorganisms</a> that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of <a href="stockfish" class="uri" title="wikilink">stockfish</a>), or in warm ovens, cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters.</p>
<p>Subjecting food to a number of chemical processes such as <a href="smoking_(cooking_technique)" title="wikilink">smoking</a>, <a href="salting_(food)" title="wikilink">salting</a>, <a href="brining" class="uri" title="wikilink">brining</a>, conserving or <a href="fermentation_(food)" title="wikilink">fermenting</a> also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in the fall was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. <a href="Butter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Butter</a> tended to be heavily salted (5&lt;U+2013&gt;10%) in order not to spoil. Vegetables, eggs or fish were also often <a href="pickling" title="wikilink">pickled</a> in tightly packed jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, <a href="verjuice" class="uri" title="wikilink">verjuice</a> or <a href="vinegar" class="uri" title="wikilink">vinegar</a>). Another method was to create a seal around the food by cooking it in sugar or <a href="honey" class="uri" title="wikilink">honey</a> or fat, in which it was then stored. Bacterial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains, fruit and <a href="grape" title="wikilink">grapes</a> were turned into alcoholic drinks that disinfected the beverage, and milk was fermented and <a href="curing_(food_preservation)" title="wikilink">cured</a> into a multitude of <a href="cheese" title="wikilink">cheeses</a> or <a href="buttermilk" class="uri" title="wikilink">buttermilk</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>The phrase <em><a href="Lord&#39;s_Prayer" title="wikilink">Our daily bread</a></em> was a concrete reality during the Middle Ages. Food intake among all social classes consisted mainly of <a href="cereal" title="wikilink">cereals</a>, usually in the form of <a href="bread" class="uri" title="wikilink">bread</a> and, to a lesser extent, gruel, <a href="porridge" class="uri" title="wikilink">porridge</a>, and <a href="pasta" class="uri" title="wikilink">pasta</a>. Estimates of bread consumption all over Europe are fairly similar: around 1&lt;U+2013&gt;1.5 <a href="kilogram" title="wikilink">kg</a> (2&lt;U+2013&gt;3 <a href="pound_(mass)" title="wikilink">lb</a>) of bread per person per day. The most common grains were <a href="rye" class="uri" title="wikilink">rye</a>, <a href="barley" class="uri" title="wikilink">barley</a>, <a href="buckwheat" class="uri" title="wikilink">buckwheat</a>, <a href="millet" class="uri" title="wikilink">millet</a> and <a href="oat" title="wikilink">oats</a>. <a href="Rice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rice</a> remained a fairly expensive import for most of the Middle Ages and was grown in northern Italy only towards the end of the period. <a href="Wheat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wheat</a> was common all over Europe and was considered to be the most <a href="nutrition" title="wikilink">nutritious</a> of all grains, but was more prestigious and thus more expensive. The finely sifted white <a href="flour" class="uri" title="wikilink">flour</a> that modern Europeans are most familiar with was reserved for the bread of the upper classes, while those of lower status ate bread that became coarser, darker and of a higher <a href="bran" class="uri" title="wikilink">bran</a> content the lower one was on the social ladder. In times of grain shortages or outright famine, grains could be supplemented with cheaper and less desirable substitutes like <a href="chestnut" title="wikilink">chestnuts</a>, dried <a href="legume" title="wikilink">legumes</a>, <a href="acorn" title="wikilink">acorns</a>, <a href="fern" title="wikilink">ferns</a> and a wide variety of more or less nutritious vegetable matter.</p>
<p>One of the most common constituents of a medieval meal, either as part of a banquet or as a small snack, were <a href="sop" title="wikilink">sops</a>, pieces of bread with which a liquid like <a href="wine" class="uri" title="wikilink">wine</a>, <a href="soup" class="uri" title="wikilink">soup</a>, <a href="broth" class="uri" title="wikilink">broth</a>, or <a href="sauce" class="uri" title="wikilink">sauce</a> could be soaked up and eaten. Another common sight at the medieval dinner table was the <a href="frumenty" class="uri" title="wikilink">frumenty</a>, a thick wheat porridge often boiled in a meat broth and seasoned with spices. Porridges were also made of every type of grain and could be served as <a href="dessert" title="wikilink">desserts</a> or dishes for the sick if boiled in milk (or <a href="almond_milk" title="wikilink">almond milk</a>) and sweetened with sugar. <a href="Pie" title="wikilink">Pies</a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> filled with meats, eggs, vegetables or fruit were common throughout Europe, as were <a href="turnover_(food)" title="wikilink">turnovers</a>, <a href="fritter" title="wikilink">fritters</a>, <a href="doughnut" title="wikilink">doughnuts</a>, and many similar <a href="pastry" title="wikilink">pastries</a>. By the <a href="Late_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Late Middle Ages</a> <a href="biscuit" title="wikilink">biscuits</a> (<a href="cookie" title="wikilink">cookies</a> in the US), and especially <a href="wafer" title="wikilink">wafers</a>, eaten for dessert had become high-prestige foods and came in many varieties. Grain, either as bread crumbs or flour, was also the most common thickener of soups and stews along, or in combination, with almond milk.</p>

<p>The importance of bread as a daily staple meant that bakers played a crucial role in any medieval community. Among the first town <a href="guild" title="wikilink">guilds</a> to be organized were the bakers', and laws and regulations were passed to keep bread prices stable. The English <em><a href="Assize_of_Bread_and_Ale" title="wikilink">Assize of Bread and Ale</a></em> of 1266 listed extensive tables where the size, weight, and price of a loaf of bread was regulated in relation to grain prices. The baker's profit margin stipulated in the tables was later increased through successful lobbying from the <a href="Worshipful_Company_of_Bakers" title="wikilink">London Baker's Company</a> by adding the cost of everything from firewood and salt to the baker's wife, house and dog. Since bread was such a central part of the medieval diet, swindling by those who were trusted with supplying the precious commodity to the community was considered a serious offense. Bakers who were caught tampering with weights or diluting their <a href="dough" title="wikilink">doughs</a> with less expensive ingredients could receive severe penalties. This gave rise to the &quot;<a href="baker&#39;s_dozen" title="wikilink">baker's dozen</a>&quot;: a baker would give 13 for the price of 12, to be certain of not being known as a cheat.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Bread was put to use for more than just eating: though often of wood or metal (mostly <a href="pewter" class="uri" title="wikilink">pewter</a>), <a href="trencher_(tableware)" title="wikilink">trenchers</a> that served as dinner plates in affluent households were made out of old bread made from unsifted flour far into the early modern era, and bread was used to wipe off knives when passing them to the next diner or before fishing out salt from the shared <a href="salt_cellar" title="wikilink">salt cellars</a>. Even the seemingly carefree handling of hot metal serving plates could be achieved with slices of bread neatly tucked into the hands of servants, but still away from the unforgiving gaze of fussy, high-ranking diners.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>While grains were the primary constituent of most meals, vegetables such as <a href="cabbage" class="uri" title="wikilink">cabbage</a>, <a href="beet" title="wikilink">beets</a>, <a href="onion" title="wikilink">onions</a>, <a href="garlic" class="uri" title="wikilink">garlic</a> and <a href="carrot" title="wikilink">carrots</a> were common foodstuffs. Many of these were eaten daily by peasants and workers, but were less prestigious than meat. The cookbooks, intended mostly for those who could afford such luxuries, which appeared in the late Middle Ages, only contained a small number of recipes using vegetables other than side dishes and the occasional <a href="potage" class="uri" title="wikilink">potage</a>. Carrots were available in two variants during the Middle Ages: a tastier reddish-purple variety and a less prestigious green-yellow type. The orange variety of carrot that is most common today did not appear until the 17th century. Various <a href="legume" title="wikilink">legumes</a>, like <a href="chickpea" title="wikilink">chickpeas</a>, <a href="vicia_faba" title="wikilink">fava beans</a> and <a href="pea" title="wikilink">peas</a> were also common and important sources of <a href="protein" class="uri" title="wikilink">protein</a>. With the exception of peas, they were frowned on by contemporary <a href="dietitian" title="wikilink">dietetics</a>, partly because of their tendency to cause <a href="flatulence" class="uri" title="wikilink">flatulence</a>. The importance of vegetables to the common people is illustrated by accounts from 16th-century Germany stating that many peasants ate <a href="sauerkraut" class="uri" title="wikilink">sauerkraut</a> three to four times a day.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Fruit was popular and could be served fresh, dried, or preserved, and was a common ingredient in many meat dishes. The practice of eating raw fruit was disfavored by physicians because of the belief that they were generally too <a href="humorism" title="wikilink">cold or moist</a> to be eaten uncooked. Since sugar and honey were expensive, it was common to include many types of fruit in dishes that called for sweeteners of some sort. The fruits of choice in the south were <a href="lemon" title="wikilink">lemons</a>, <a href="citron" title="wikilink">citrons</a>, <a href="bitter_orange" title="wikilink">bitter oranges</a> (the sweet type was not introduced until several hundred years later), <a href="pomegranate" title="wikilink">pomegranates</a>, <a href="quince" title="wikilink">quinces</a>, and, of course, <a href="grape" title="wikilink">grapes</a>. Further north, <a href="apple" title="wikilink">apples</a>, <a href="pear" title="wikilink">pears</a>, <a href="plum" title="wikilink">plums</a>, and <a href="strawberry" title="wikilink">strawberries</a> were more common. <a href="Fig" title="wikilink">Figs</a> and <a href="Date_Palm" title="wikilink">dates</a> were eaten all over Europe, but remained rather expensive imports in the north.</p>
<p>Common and often basic ingredients in many modern European cuisines like <a href="potato" title="wikilink">potatoes</a>, <a href="Common_bean#Red_beans" title="wikilink">kidney beans</a>, <a href="cacao" class="uri" title="wikilink">cacao</a>, <a href="vanilla" class="uri" title="wikilink">vanilla</a>, <a href="tomato" title="wikilink">tomatoes</a>, <a href="chili_pepper" title="wikilink">chili peppers</a> and <a href="maize" class="uri" title="wikilink">maize</a> were not available to Europeans until the late 15th century with the European contact with the Americas, and even then it often took a long time for the new foodstuffs to be accepted by society at large.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>While all forms of wild <a href="game_(food)" title="wikilink">game</a> were popular among those who could obtain it, most meat came from domesticated animals. <a href="Beef" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beef</a> was not as common as today because raising <a href="cattle" class="uri" title="wikilink">cattle</a> was labor-intensive, requiring pastures and feed, and oxen and cows were much more valuable as <a href="working_animal" title="wikilink">draught animals</a> and for producing milk. Animals slaughtered because they were no longer able to work were not particularly appetizing and were therefore less valued. Far more common was <a href="pork" class="uri" title="wikilink">pork</a>, as <a href="pig" title="wikilink">pigs</a> required less attention and cheaper feed. Domestic pigs often ran freely even in towns and could be fed on just about any organic kitchen waste, and <a href="suckling_pig" title="wikilink">suckling pig</a> was a sought-after delicacy. <a href="Lamb_(food)" title="wikilink">Mutton and lamb</a> were fairly common, especially in areas with a sizeable <a href="wool" class="uri" title="wikilink">wool</a> industry, as was <a href="veal" class="uri" title="wikilink">veal</a>. Unlike most of the modern Western world, just about every part of the animal was eaten, including ears, snout, tail, <a href="Tongue#Tongue_as_a_food" title="wikilink">tongue</a>, and womb. Intestines, bladder and stomach could be used as <a href="casing_(sausage)" title="wikilink">casings</a> for <a href="sausage" class="uri" title="wikilink">sausage</a> or even illusion food such as giant eggs. Among the meats that today are rare or even considered inappropriate for human consumption were <a href="hedgehog" class="uri" title="wikilink">hedgehog</a> and <a href="porcupine" class="uri" title="wikilink">porcupine</a>, occasionally mentioned in <a href="Late_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">late medieval</a> recipe collections.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Both were considered lesser forms of pig, hence their names.</p>
<p>A wide range of birds was eaten, including <a href="swan" title="wikilink">swans</a>, <a href="peafowl" class="uri" title="wikilink">peafowl</a>, <a href="quail" class="uri" title="wikilink">quail</a>, <a href="partridge" class="uri" title="wikilink">partridge</a>, <a href="stork" title="wikilink">storks</a>, <a href="crane_(bird)" title="wikilink">cranes</a>, <a href="lark" title="wikilink">larks</a> and just about any wild bird that could be hunted. Swans and peafowl were often domesticated, but were only eaten by the social elite, and more praised for their fine appearance (often used to create stunning <a href="entremet" title="wikilink">entremets</a>) than for their meat. As today, <a href="goose" title="wikilink">geese</a> and <a href="duck" title="wikilink">ducks</a> had been domesticated but were not as popular as the <a href="chicken" class="uri" title="wikilink">chicken</a>, the fowl equivalent of the pig. Curiously enough the <a href="barnacle_goose" title="wikilink">barnacle goose</a> was believed to reproduce not by laying eggs like other birds, but by growing in <a href="barnacle" title="wikilink">barnacles</a>, and was hence considered acceptable food for fast and <a href="Lent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lent</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Meats were more expensive than plant foods. Though rich in <a href="protein" class="uri" title="wikilink">protein</a>, the <a href="calorie" class="uri" title="wikilink">calorie</a>-to-weight ratio of meat was less than that of plant food. Meat could be up to four times as expensive as bread. Fish was up to 16 times as costly, and was still expensive even for coastal populations. This meant that fasts could mean an especially meager diet for those who could not afford alternatives to meat and animal products like milk and eggs. It was only after the <a href="Black_Death" title="wikilink">Black Death</a> had eradicated up to half of the European population that meat became more common even for poorer people. The drastic reduction in many populated areas resulted in a labor shortage, meaning that wages shot up. It also left vast areas of farmland untended, making them available for <a href="pasture" class="uri" title="wikilink">pasture</a> and putting more meat on the market.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>Although less prestigious than other animal meats, and often seen as merely an alternative to meat on fast days, <a href="seafood" class="uri" title="wikilink">seafood</a> was still the mainstay of many coastal populations. &quot;Fish&quot; to the medieval man was also a general name for anything not considered a proper land-living animal, including <a href="marine_mammal" title="wikilink">marine mammals</a> such as <a href="whale" title="wikilink">whales</a> and <a href="porpoise" title="wikilink">porpoises</a>. Also included were the <a href="beaver" class="uri" title="wikilink">beaver</a>, due to its scaly tail and considerable time spent in water, and <a href="barnacle_goose" title="wikilink">barnacle geese</a>, due to lack of knowledge of where they migrated. Such foods were also considered appropriate for fast days.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Especially important was the fishing and trade in <a href="herring" class="uri" title="wikilink">herring</a> and <a href="cod" class="uri" title="wikilink">cod</a> in the <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic</a> and the <a href="Baltic_Sea" title="wikilink">Baltic Sea</a>. The herring was of unprecedented significance to the economy of much of Northern Europe, and it was one of the most common commodities traded by the <a href="Hanseatic_League" title="wikilink">Hanseatic League</a>, a powerful north German alliance of trading guilds. <a href="Kipper" title="wikilink">Kippers</a> made from herring caught in the <a href="North_Sea" title="wikilink">North Sea</a> could be found in markets as far away as <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a>. While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked. <a href="Stockfish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stockfish</a>, cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water. A wide range of <a href="Mollusca" title="wikilink">mollusks</a> including <a href="oyster" title="wikilink">oysters</a>, <a href="mussel" title="wikilink">mussels</a> and <a href="scallop" title="wikilink">scallops</a> were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and freshwater <a href="crayfish" class="uri" title="wikilink">crayfish</a> were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days. Compared to meat, fish was much more expensive for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most. Freshwater fish such as <a href="Esox" title="wikilink">pike</a>, <a href="carp" class="uri" title="wikilink">carp</a>, <a href="bream" class="uri" title="wikilink">bream</a>, <a href="perch" class="uri" title="wikilink">perch</a>, <a href="lamprey" class="uri" title="wikilink">lamprey</a>, and <a href="trout" class="uri" title="wikilink">trout</a> were common.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>In modern times, <a href="water" class="uri" title="wikilink">water</a> is seen as a common choice to drink with a meal. In the Middle Ages, however, concerns over purity, medical recommendations and its low prestige value made it less favored, and <a href="alcoholic_beverage" title="wikilink">alcoholic beverages</a> were always preferred. They were seen as more nutritious and beneficial to <a href="digestion" class="uri" title="wikilink">digestion</a> than water, with the invaluable bonus of being less prone to putrefaction due to the alcohol content. <a href="Wine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wine</a> was consumed on a daily basis in most of <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a> and all over the Western Mediterranean wherever <a href="grape" title="wikilink">grapes</a> were cultivated. Further north it remained the preferred drink of the <a href="bourgeoisie" class="uri" title="wikilink">bourgeoisie</a> and the nobility who could afford it, and far less common among peasants and workers. The drink of commoners in the northern parts of the continent was primarily <a href="beer" class="uri" title="wikilink">beer</a> or <a href="ale" class="uri" title="wikilink">ale</a>. Because of the difficulty of preserving this beverage for any time (especially before the introduction of <a href="hops" class="uri" title="wikilink">hops</a>), it was mostly consumed fresh; it was therefore cloudier and perhaps had a lower alcohol content than the typical modern equivalent. Plain <a href="milk" class="uri" title="wikilink">milk</a> was not consumed by adults except the poor or sick, being reserved for the very young or elderly, and then usually as <a href="buttermilk" class="uri" title="wikilink">buttermilk</a> or <a href="whey" class="uri" title="wikilink">whey</a>. Fresh milk was overall less common than other <a href="dairy" class="uri" title="wikilink">dairy</a> products because of the lack of technology to keep it from spoiling.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Juice" title="wikilink">Juices</a>, as well as wines, of a multitude of fruits and berries had been known at least since <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Roman antiquity</a> and were still consumed in the Middle Ages: <a href="perry" class="uri" title="wikilink">perry</a>, <em><a href="cotignac" class="uri" title="wikilink">cotignac</a></em> from <a href="medlar" title="wikilink">medlars</a> or <a href="quince" class="uri" title="wikilink">quince</a>, wine from <a href="pomegranate" class="uri" title="wikilink">pomegranate</a>, <a href="mulberry" title="wikilink">mulberries</a>, <a href="blackberry" title="wikilink">blackberries</a>, and <a href="cider" class="uri" title="wikilink">cider</a>, which was especially popular in the north where both apples and pears were plentiful. Medieval drinks that have survived to this day include <em>prunell&lt;U+00E9&gt;</em> from wild <a href="plum" title="wikilink">plums</a> (modern-day <a href="slivovitz" class="uri" title="wikilink">slivovitz</a>), mulberry <a href="gin" class="uri" title="wikilink">gin</a> and blackberry wine. Many variants of <a href="mead" class="uri" title="wikilink">mead</a> have been found in medieval recipes, with or without alcoholic content. However, the <a href="honey" class="uri" title="wikilink">honey</a>-based drink became less common as a table beverage towards the end of the period and eventually wound up primarily as a sick-potion. <a href="Kumis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kumis</a>, the fermented milk of <a href="horse" title="wikilink">mares</a> or <a href="camel" title="wikilink">camels</a>, was known in Europe, but as with mead was mostly something prescribed by physicians.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Mead has often been presented as the common drink of the <a href="Slavic_peoples" title="wikilink">Slavs</a>. This is partially true since mead bore great symbolic value at important occasions. When agreeing on treaties and other important affairs of state, mead was often presented as a ceremonial gift. It was also common at weddings and <a href="baptism" title="wikilink">baptismal</a> parties, though in limited quantity due to its high price. In medieval <a href="Poland_in_the_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Poland</a>, mead had a status equivalent to that of imported luxuries, such as spices and wines.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="wine">Wine</h3>

<p><img src="Medieval_wine_conservation.jpg" title="fig:A matron demonstrates how to properly treat and conserve wine." alt="A matron demonstrates how to properly treat and conserve wine." width="200" /> Wine was commonly drunk and was also regarded as the most prestigious and healthy choice. According to <a href="Galen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galen</a>'s dietetics it was considered hot and dry (hence the modern use of &quot;dry&quot; in describing wine), but these qualities were moderated when wine was watered down. Unlike water or beer, which were considered cold and moist, consumption of wine in moderation (especially <a href="red_wine" title="wikilink">red wine</a>) was, among other things, believed to aid digestion, generate good <a href="blood" class="uri" title="wikilink">blood</a> and brighten the mood. The quality of wine differed considerably according to <a href="vintage" class="uri" title="wikilink">vintage</a>, the type of grape and more importantly, the number of grape pressings. The first pressing was made into the finest and most expensive wines which were reserved for the upper classes. The second and third pressings were subsequently of lower quality and alcohol content. Common folk usually had to settle for a cheap white or <a href="ros&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">ros&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> from a second or even third pressing, meaning that it could be consumed in quite generous amounts without leading to heavy intoxication. For the poorest (or the most pious), watered-down <a href="vinegar" class="uri" title="wikilink">vinegar</a> would often be the only available choice.</p>
<p>The aging of high quality red wine required specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation must have been a widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th-century cookbook <em><a href="Viandier" title="wikilink">Le Viandier</a></em> there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt <a href="lees_(fermentation)" title="wikilink">lees</a> of white wine were both effective <a href="bacteriocide" title="wikilink">bactericides</a>, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or <a href="mulled_wine" title="wikilink">mulled wine</a> was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as <a href="ginger" class="uri" title="wikilink">ginger</a>, <a href="cardamom" class="uri" title="wikilink">cardamom</a>, <a href="Piper_(genus)" title="wikilink">pepper</a>, <a href="Aframomum_melegueta" title="wikilink">grains of paradise</a>, <a href="nutmeg" class="uri" title="wikilink">nutmeg</a>, <a href="clove" title="wikilink">cloves</a> and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either <a href="steeping" title="wikilink">steeped</a> in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce <a href="hypocras" class="uri" title="wikilink">hypocras</a> and <em><a href="claret#History" title="wikilink">clar&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a></em>. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="beer">Beer</h3>

<p>While wine was the most common table beverage in much of Europe, this was not the case in the northern regions where grapes were not cultivated. Those who could afford it drank imported wine, but even for nobility in these areas it was common to drink <a href="beer" class="uri" title="wikilink">beer</a> or <a href="ale" class="uri" title="wikilink">ale</a>, particularly towards the end of the Middle Ages. In <a href="Medieval_England" title="wikilink">England</a>, the <a href="Low_Countries" title="wikilink">Low Countries</a>, northern <a href="Germany_in_the_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Germany</a>, <a href="Poland_in_the_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Poland</a> and <a href="History_of_Scandinavia" title="wikilink">Scandinavia</a>, beer was consumed on a daily basis by people of all social classes. However, the heavy influence from <a href="Arabic_culture" title="wikilink">Arab</a> and Mediterranean culture on medical science (particularly due to the <a href="Reconquista" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reconquista</a> and the influx of Arabic texts) meant that beer was often heavily disfavored. For most medieval Europeans, it was a humble brew compared with common southern drinks and cooking ingredients, such as wine, lemons and <a href="olive_oil" title="wikilink">olive oil</a>. Even comparatively exotic products like <a href="camel" class="uri" title="wikilink">camel</a>'s milk and <a href="gazelle" class="uri" title="wikilink">gazelle</a> meat generally received more positive attention in medical texts. Beer was just an acceptable alternative and was assigned various negative qualities. In 1256, the <a href="Siena" title="wikilink">Sienese</a> physician <a href="Aldobrandino" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aldobrandino</a> described beer in the following way:  The intoxicating effect of beer was believed to last longer than that of wine, but it was also admitted that it did not create the &quot;false thirst&quot; associated with wine. Though less prominent than in the north, beer was consumed in northern France and the Italian mainland. Perhaps as a consequence of the <a href="Norman_conquest_of_England" title="wikilink">Norman conquest</a> and the travelling of nobles between France and England, one French variant described in the 14th-century <a href="cookbook" class="uri" title="wikilink">cookbook</a> <em><a href="Le_Menagier_de_Paris" title="wikilink">Le Menagier de Paris</a></em> was called <em>godale</em> (most likely a direct borrowing from the <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> &quot;good ale&quot;) and was made from barley and <a href="spelt" class="uri" title="wikilink">spelt</a>, but without <a href="hops" class="uri" title="wikilink">hops</a>. In England there were also the variants <em><a href="posset" title="wikilink">poset ale</a></em>, made from hot milk and cold ale, and <em>brakot</em> or <em><a href="Mead#Mead_variants" title="wikilink">braggot</a></em>, a spiced ale prepared much like <a href="hypocras" class="uri" title="wikilink">hypocras</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>That hops could be used for flavoring beer had been known at least since <a href="Carolingian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carolingian</a> times, but was adopted gradually due to difficulties in establishing the appropriate proportions. Before the discovery of hops, <a href="gruit" class="uri" title="wikilink">gruit</a>, a mix of various <a href="herb" title="wikilink">herbs</a>, had been used. Gruit did not have the same preserving properties as hops, and the end result had to be consumed quickly to avoid the inevitable spoiling. Another flavoring method was to increase the alcohol content, but this was more expensive and lent the beer the undesired characteristic of being a quick and heavy intoxicant. In the <a href="Early_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Early Middle Ages</a> beer was primarily brewed in <a href="monastery" title="wikilink">monasteries</a>, and on a smaller scale in individual households. By the <a href="High_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">High Middle Ages</a> breweries in the fledgling <a href="medieval_commune" title="wikilink">medieval towns</a> of northern Germany began to take over production. Though most of the breweries were small family businesses that employed at most eight to ten people, regular production allowed for investment in better equipment and increased experimentation with new recipes and brewing techniques. These operations later spread to <a href="Holland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Holland</a> in the 14th century, then to <a href="Flanders" class="uri" title="wikilink">Flanders</a> and <a href="Duchy_of_Brabant" title="wikilink">Brabant</a>, and reached England by the 15th century. Hopped beer became very popular in the last decades of the <a href="Late_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Late Middle Ages</a>. In England and the Low Countries, the per capita annual consumption was around 275&lt;U+2013&gt;300 <a href="litre" title="wikilink">liters</a> (60&lt;U+2013&gt;66 <a href="gallon" title="wikilink">gallons</a>), and it was consumed with practically every meal: low alcohol-content beers for breakfast, and stronger ones later in the day. When perfected as an ingredient, hops could make beer keep for six months or more, and facilitated extensive exports.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="distillates">Distillates</h3>
<p>The art of <a href="distillation" class="uri" title="wikilink">distillation</a> was practiced by the <a href="History_of_China#Ancient_history" title="wikilink">Chinese</a>, who prepared a form of rice <a href="whisky" class="uri" title="wikilink">whisky</a> in porcelain <a href="still" title="wikilink">stills</a> as early as the 9th century BC. The <a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">ancient Greeks</a> and <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Romans</a> also knew of the technique, but it was not practiced on a major scale until some time around the 12th century, when Arabic innovations in the field combined with water-cooled glass <a href="alembic" title="wikilink">alembics</a> were introduced. Distillation was believed by medieval scholars to produce the essence of the liquid being purified, and the term <em><a href="aqua_vitae" title="wikilink">aqua vitae</a></em> (&quot;water of life&quot;) was used as a generic term for all kinds of distillates into the 17th century. The early use of various <a href="distilled_beverage" title="wikilink">distillates</a>, alcoholic or not, was varied, but it was primarily culinary or medicinal; grape <a href="syrup" class="uri" title="wikilink">syrup</a> mixed with sugar and spices was prescribed for a variety of ailments, and <a href="rosewater" title="wikilink">rose water</a> was used as a <a href="perfume" class="uri" title="wikilink">perfume</a> and cooking ingredient and for hand washing. Alcoholic distillates were also occasionally used to create dazzling, fire-breathing <a href="entremet" title="wikilink">entremets</a> (a type of entertainment dish served between courses) by soaking a piece of <a href="cotton" class="uri" title="wikilink">cotton</a> in spirits. It would then be placed in the mouth of the stuffed, cooked and occasionally redressed animals, and lit just before presenting the creation.</p>
<p><em>Aqua vitae</em> in its alcoholic forms was highly praised by medieval physicians. In 1309 <a href="Arnaldus_de_Villa_Nova" title="wikilink">Arnaldus of Villanova</a> wrote that &quot;It prolongs good health, dissipates superfluous humours, reanimates the heart and maintains youth.&quot; In the Late Middle Ages, the production of <a href="moonshine" class="uri" title="wikilink">moonshine</a> started to pick up, especially in the <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German</a>-speaking regions. By the 13th century, <em>Hausbrand</em> (literally &quot;home-burnt&quot; from <em>gebrannter wein, brandwein</em>; &quot;burnt (distilled) wine&quot;) was commonplace, marking the origin of <a href="brandy" class="uri" title="wikilink">brandy</a>. Towards the end of the Late Middle Ages, the consumption of spirits became so engrained even among the general population that restrictions on sales and production began to appear in the late 15th century. In 1496 the city of <a href="Nuremberg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nuremberg</a> issued restrictions on the selling of <em>aquavit</em> on Sundays and official holidays.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Spice" title="wikilink">Spices</a> were among the most luxurious products available in the Middle Ages, the most common being <a href="black_pepper" title="wikilink">black pepper</a>, <a href="cinnamon" class="uri" title="wikilink">cinnamon</a> (and the cheaper alternative <a href="cassia" class="uri" title="wikilink">cassia</a>), <a href="cumin" class="uri" title="wikilink">cumin</a>, <a href="nutmeg" class="uri" title="wikilink">nutmeg</a>, <a href="ginger" class="uri" title="wikilink">ginger</a> and <a href="clove" title="wikilink">cloves</a>. They all had to be imported from plantations in <a href="Asia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asia</a> and <a href="Africa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Africa</a>, which made them extremely expensive. It has been estimated that around 1,000 <a href="ton" title="wikilink">tons</a> of pepper and 1,000 tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the late Middle Ages. The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain for 1.5 million people.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> While pepper was the most common spice, the most exclusive was <a href="saffron" class="uri" title="wikilink">saffron</a>, used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor. Spices that have now fallen into some obscurity include <a href="Aframomum_melegueta" title="wikilink">grains of paradise</a>, a relative of <a href="cardamom" class="uri" title="wikilink">cardamom</a> which almost entirely replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking, <a href="long_pepper" title="wikilink">long pepper</a>, <a href="nutmeg" title="wikilink">mace</a>, <a href="spikenard" class="uri" title="wikilink">spikenard</a>, <a href="galangal" class="uri" title="wikilink">galangal</a> and <a href="cubeb" class="uri" title="wikilink">cubeb</a>. <a href="Sugar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sugar</a>, unlike today, was considered to be a type of spice due to its high cost and humoral qualities.</p>
<p>Common herbs such as <a href="common_sage" title="wikilink">sage</a>, <a href="Mustard_plant" title="wikilink">mustard</a>, and especially <a href="parsley" class="uri" title="wikilink">parsley</a> were grown and used in cooking all over Europe, as were <a href="caraway" class="uri" title="wikilink">caraway</a>, <a href="Mentha" title="wikilink">mint</a>, <a href="dill" class="uri" title="wikilink">dill</a> and <a href="fennel" class="uri" title="wikilink">fennel</a>. <a href="Anise" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anise</a> could be used to flavor fish and chicken dishes, and its seeds were served as sugar-coated <a href="comfit" title="wikilink">comfits</a>. Locally grown <a href="herb" title="wikilink">herbs</a> were more affordable and were also used in upper-class food, but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring. A popular modern-day misconception is that medieval cooks used liberal amounts of spices, particularly black pepper, merely to disguise the taste of spoiled meat. However, a medieval feast was as much a culinary event as it was a display of the host's vast resources and generosity, and as most nobles had a wide selection of fresh or preserved meats, fish or seafood to choose from, the use of ruinously expensive spices on cheap, rotting meat would have made little sense.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="sweets-and-desserts">Sweets and desserts</h2>
<p>The term &quot;<a href="dessert" class="uri" title="wikilink">dessert</a>&quot; comes from the <a href="Old_French" title="wikilink">Old French</a> <em>desservir</em>, &quot;to clear a table&quot;, literally &quot;to un-serve&quot;, and originated during the Middle Ages. It would typically consist of <a href="drag&lt;U+00E9&gt;e" title="wikilink">drag&lt;U+00E9&gt;es</a> and mulled wine accompanied by aged <a href="cheese" class="uri" title="wikilink">cheese</a>, and by the Late Middle Ages could also include fresh fruit covered in sugar, honey or syrup and boiled-down fruit pastes. There was a wide variety of <a href="fritter" title="wikilink">fritters</a>, <a href="cr&lt;U+00EA&gt;pe" title="wikilink">cr&lt;U+00EA&gt;pes</a> with sugar, sweet <a href="custard" title="wikilink">custards</a> and <a href="dariole" title="wikilink">darioles</a>, almond milk and eggs in a pastry shell that could also include fruit and sometimes even bone marrow or fish.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> German-speaking areas had a particular fondness for <em>krapfen</em>: fried pastries and dough with various sweet and savory fillings. <a href="Marzipan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marzipan</a> in many forms was well-known in Italy and southern France by the 1340s and is assumed to be of Arab origin.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <a href="Anglo-Norman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Norman</a> cookbooks are full of recipes for sweet and savory custards, <a href="potage" title="wikilink">potages</a>, sauces and <a href="tart" title="wikilink">tarts</a> with strawberries, <a href="cherry" title="wikilink">cherries</a>, apples and plums. The English chefs also had a penchant for using flower petals of <a href="rose" title="wikilink">roses</a> and <a href="elderberry" class="uri" title="wikilink">elderberry</a>. An early form of <a href="quiche" class="uri" title="wikilink">quiche</a> can be found in <em><a href="Forme_of_Cury" title="wikilink">Forme of Cury</a></em>, a 14th-century recipe collection, as a <em>Torte de Bry</em> with a cheese and egg yolk filling.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>In northern France, a wide assortment of <a href="waffle" title="wikilink">waffles</a> and <a href="wafer" title="wikilink">wafers</a> was eaten with cheese and <a href="hypocras" class="uri" title="wikilink">hypocras</a> or a sweet <a href="Malvasia" title="wikilink">malmsey</a> as <em>issue de table</em> (&quot;departure from the table&quot;). The ever-present candied ginger, <a href="coriander" class="uri" title="wikilink">coriander</a>, <a href="anise" title="wikilink">aniseed</a> and other spices were referred to as <em>&lt;U+00E9&gt;pices de chambre</em> (&quot;parlor spices&quot;) and were taken as digestables at the end of a meal to &quot;close&quot; the stomach.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Like their Muslim counterparts in <a href="Al-Andalus" title="wikilink">Spain</a>, the Arab conquerors of <a href="Sicily" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sicily</a> introduced a wide variety of new sweets and desserts that eventually found their way to the rest of Europe. Just like <a href="Montpellier" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montpellier</a>, Sicily was once famous for its <em><a href="comfit" title="wikilink">comfits</a></em>, nougat candy (<em>torrone</em>, or <em><a href="turr&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" class="uri" title="wikilink">turr&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</a></em> in <a href="Spanish_language" title="wikilink">Spanish</a>) and almond clusters (<em>confetti</em>). From the south, the Arabs also brought the art of <a href="ice_cream" title="wikilink">ice cream</a> making that produced <a href="sherbet_(U.S.)" title="wikilink">sherbets</a> and several examples of sweet cakes and pastries; <em>cassata alla Siciliana</em> (from <a href="Arabic_language" title="wikilink">Arabic</a> <em>qas'ah</em>, the term for the <a href="terra_cotta" title="wikilink">terra cotta</a> bowl with which it was shaped), made from marzipan, <a href="sponge_cake" title="wikilink">sponge cake</a> and sweetened <a href="ricotta" class="uri" title="wikilink">ricotta</a> and <em>cannoli alla Siciliana</em>, originally <em>cappelli di turchi</em> (&quot;Turkish hats&quot;), fried, chilled pastry tubes with a sweet cheese filling.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a> and <a href="Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Eastern Orthodox Churches</a> and their calendars had great influence on eating habits; consumption of meat was forbidden for a full third of the year for most <a href="History_of_Christianity#Church_of_the_High_Middle_Ages_(800_&lt;U+2013&gt;_1499)" title="wikilink">Christians</a>, and all animal products, including <a href="egg_(food)" title="wikilink">eggs</a> and <a href="dairy_product" title="wikilink">dairy products</a> (but not fish), were generally prohibited during <a href="Lent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lent</a> and <a href="fasting" title="wikilink">fast</a>. The church often made exceptions where non-animal alternatives were unavailable or simply unaffordable (e.g. the <a href="puffin" class="uri" title="wikilink">puffin</a> being considered a fish for coastal fishermen in <a href="History_of_Norway" title="wikilink">Norway</a>). Exempt from fasting regulations were children, the old, <a href="pilgrim" title="wikilink">pilgrims</a>, workers and beggars, but not the poor as long as they had some sort of shelter. Additionally, it was customary for all citizens to fast prior to taking the <a href="Eucharist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eucharist</a>, and these fasts were occasionally for a full day and required total abstinence.</p>
<p>Medical science of the Middle Ages had a much greater influence on what was considered healthy and nutritious. One's lifestyle &lt;U+2014&gt; including diet, exercise, appropriate social behavior, and approved medical remedies &lt;U+2014&gt; was the way to good health, and all types of food were assigned certain properties that affected a person's health. All foodstuffs were also classified on scales ranging from hot to cold and moist to dry, according to the <a href="four_humors" title="wikilink">four bodily humors</a> theory proposed by <a href="Galen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galen</a> that dominated Western medical science from late Antiquity until the 17th century.</p>

<p>Apart from the regimen dictated by physicians, the medieval diet was heavily influenced by religious restrictions. Both the eastern and the western churches ordained that feast should be alternated with fast. In most of Europe, Wednesdays, Fridays, sometimes Saturdays and various other days on the calendar, including <a href="Lent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lent</a> and <a href="Advent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Advent</a>, were fast days. Meat and animal products like milk, cheese, butter and eggs were not allowed, only fish. The fast was intended to mortify the body and invigorate the soul, to reinforce the medieval <a href="dogma" class="uri" title="wikilink">dogma</a> that the flesh was inferior, and also to remind of <a href="Christ" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christ</a>'s sacrifice for humanity. The intention was not to portray certain foods as unclean, but rather that abstention was a spiritual lesson in self-restraint. During particularly severe fast days, the number of daily meals was also reduced to one. Even if most people respected these restrictions and usually made <a href="penance" class="uri" title="wikilink">penance</a> when they violated them, there were also numerous ways of circumventing the problem, a conflict of ideals and practice eloquently summarized by scholar Bridget Ann Henisch:</p>

<p>While animal products were to be avoided during times of penance, pragmatic compromises often prevailed. The definition of &quot;fish&quot; was often extended to marine and semi-aquatic animals such as <a href="whale" title="wikilink">whales</a>, <a href="barnacle_goose" title="wikilink">barnacle geese</a>, puffins and even <a href="beaver" title="wikilink">beavers</a>. The choice of ingredients may have been limited, but that did not mean that meals were smaller. Neither were there any restrictions against (moderate) drinking or eating sweets. Banquets held on fish days could be splendid, and they were popular occasions for serving illusion food that imitated meat, cheese and eggs in various ingenious ways; fish could be molded to look like <a href="venison" class="uri" title="wikilink">venison</a> and fake eggs could made by stuffing empty egg shells with fish <a href="roe" class="uri" title="wikilink">roe</a> and almond milk and cooking it in coals. While <a href="Byzantine_Empire" title="wikilink">Byzantine</a> church officials took a hard-line approach, and discouraged any culinary refinement for the clergy, their western counterparts were far more lenient.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> There are many accounts of members of <a href="Christian_monasticism" title="wikilink">monastic orders</a> who flouted fasting restrictions through clever interpretations of the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a>. Since the sick were exempt from fasting, there often evolved the notion that fasting restrictions only applied to the main dining area, and many <a href="friar" title="wikilink">friars</a> would simply eat their fast day meals in what would later evolve into the <a href="misericord" class="uri" title="wikilink">misericord</a> rather than the <a href="refectory" class="uri" title="wikilink">refectory</a>. Newly assigned Catholic monastery officials sought to amend the problem of fast evasion not merely with moral condemnation, but by making sure that well-prepared non-meat dishes were available on fast days. There was also no lack of grumbling about the rigors of fast among the laity. During Lent, kings and schoolboys, commoners and nobility, all complained about being deprived of meat for the long, hard weeks of solemn contemplation of their sins. At Lent, owners of livestock were even warned to keep an eye out for hungry dogs frustrated by a &quot;hard siege by Lent and fish bones&quot;.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>Medieval scholars considered human <a href="digestion" class="uri" title="wikilink">digestion</a> to be a process similar to cooking. The processing of food in the stomach was seen as a continuation of the preparation initiated by the cook. In order for the food to be properly &quot;cooked&quot; and for the nutrients to be properly absorbed, it was important that the <a href="stomach" class="uri" title="wikilink">stomach</a> be filled in an appropriate manner. Easily digestible foods would be consumed first, followed by gradually heavier dishes. If this regimen was not respected it was believed that heavy foods would sink to the bottom of the stomach, thus blocking the digestion duct, so that food would digest very slowly and cause putrefaction of the body and draw bad humors into the stomach. It was also of vital importance that food of differing properties not be mixed.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Before a meal, the stomach would preferably be &quot;opened&quot; with an <em><a href="ap&lt;U+00E9&gt;ritif" class="uri" title="wikilink">ap&lt;U+00E9&gt;ritif</a></em> (from <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> <em>aperire</em>, &quot;to open&quot;) that was preferably of a hot and dry nature: <a href="confection" title="wikilink">confections</a> made from <a href="sugar" class="uri" title="wikilink">sugar</a>- or <a href="honey" class="uri" title="wikilink">honey</a>-coated spices like <a href="ginger" class="uri" title="wikilink">ginger</a>, <a href="caraway" class="uri" title="wikilink">caraway</a> and seeds of <a href="anise" class="uri" title="wikilink">anise</a>, <a href="fennel" class="uri" title="wikilink">fennel</a> or <a href="cumin" class="uri" title="wikilink">cumin</a>, wine and sweetened fortified milk drinks. As the stomach had been opened, it should then be &quot;closed&quot; at the end of the meal with the help of a digestive, most commonly a <a href="drag&lt;U+00E9&gt;e" class="uri" title="wikilink">drag&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</a>, which during the Middle Ages consisted of lumps of spiced sugar, or <a href="hypocras" class="uri" title="wikilink">hypocras</a>, a wine flavored with fragrant spices, along with aged cheese.</p>
<p>A meal would ideally begin with easily digestible fruit, such as apples. It would then be followed by vegetables such as <a href="lettuce" class="uri" title="wikilink">lettuce</a>, <a href="cabbage" class="uri" title="wikilink">cabbage</a>, <a href="Portulaca_oleracea" title="wikilink">purslane</a>, herbs, moist fruits, light meats like chicken or <a href="Domestic_goat#Meat" title="wikilink">goat kid</a> with <a href="potage" title="wikilink">potages</a> and <a href="broth" title="wikilink">broths</a>. Later would be consumed heavy meats such as <a href="pork" class="uri" title="wikilink">pork</a> and <a href="beef" class="uri" title="wikilink">beef</a>, as well as vegetables and nuts like pears and chestnuts, both considered difficult to digest. It was popular (and recommended by medical expertise) to finish the meal with aged cheese and various digestives.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
