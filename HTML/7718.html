<p><strong>Kevin Peter Pietersen</strong>, <a href="Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">MBE</a> (born 27 June 1980) is a South African-born English <a href="cricket" title="wikilink">cricketer</a>. He is a right-handed <a href="batsman" class="uri" title="wikilink">batsman</a> and occasional <a href="off_spin" title="wikilink">off spin</a> <a href="Bowler_(cricket)" title="wikilink">bowler</a> who plays for <a href="England_cricket_team" title="wikilink">England</a> and <a href="Surrey_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Surrey</a>. He had also played for <a href="Indian_Premier_League" title="wikilink">Indian Premier League</a> team <a href="Royal_Challengers_Bangalore" title="wikilink">Royal Challengers Bangalore</a> for its second and third seasons, captaining the side in his first, prior to being bought by the <a href="Deccan_Chargers" title="wikilink">Deccan Chargers</a> for the fourth season of the competition. He was captain of the England <a href="Test_cricket" title="wikilink">Test</a> and <a href="One_Day_International" title="wikilink">One Day International</a> teams from 4 August 2008 to 7 January 2009 but resigned after just three tests and nine One Day Internationals, following a dispute with England coach <a href="Peter_Moores_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Peter Moores</a>, who was sacked the same day. He is regarded as one of the best batsmen in the world, and is certainly the most destructive,as he is capable of taking on any bowling.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Pietersen was born in <a href="Pietermaritzburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pietermaritzburg</a>, <a href="Natal_Province" title="wikilink">Natal</a>, <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africa</a>. He made his <a href="First-class_cricket" title="wikilink">first-class</a> debut for <a href="KwaZulu_Natal_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Natal</a> in 1997 before <a href="International_cricketers_of_South_African_origin" title="wikilink">moving to England</a> after voicing his displeasure at the <a href="racial_quota" title="wikilink">racial quota</a> system in place in South Africa.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> His English mother gave Pietersen eligibility to play for England, and after serving a qualifying period of four years playing at <a href="county_cricket" title="wikilink">county</a> level, he was called up almost immediately into the national side. He made his international debut in the One Day International match against <a href="Zimbabwe_national_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Zimbabwe</a> in 2004,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and his Test match debut in the <a href="2005_Ashes_series" title="wikilink">2005 Ashes series</a> against <a href="Australia_national_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Australia</a> the following year.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The England team's subsequent reliance on Pietersen since his debut has resulted in only one first-class appearance for Hampshire since 2005, which resulted in Pietersen looking to leave the club in 2010.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He subsequently joined <a href="Surrey_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Surrey</a> on loan for the remainder on the 2010 English county cricket season after being dropped by England due to a poor run of form, soon before joining the club permanently from the 2011 season onwards.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Pietersen became the fastest batsman to reach both 1,000 and 2,000 runs in One Day International cricket,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and the quickest in terms of time to 5,000 Test runs.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> He has the highest average of any England player to have played more than 20 innings of one-day cricket.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He has the second-highest run total from his first 25 Tests, behind only the Australian <a href="Donald_Bradman" title="wikilink">Donald Bradman</a>,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and was the fastest player, in terms of days, to reach 4,000 Test runs.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> He became only the third English batsman to top the ICC One Day International rankings, doing so in March 2007.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In July 2008, after a century against South Africa, <em><a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">The Times</a></em> called him &quot;the most complete batsman in cricket&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <a href="Shane_Warne" title="wikilink">Shane Warne</a>, a close friend, in a September serial for the same newspaper, wrote, &quot;I don't think he has an obvious flaw in his technique.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-and-personal-life">Early and personal life</h2>
<p>Born of an English mother, Penny, and an <a href="Afrikaner" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afrikaner</a> father, Jannie,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Pietersen had a strict and well-disciplined childhood, along with his three brothers Tony, Greg and Bryan;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> he learned valuable lessons from this &quot;fantastic&quot; approach to parenting, and said: &quot;Discipline is good. It taught me that I didn't always have to have what I wanted; that what I needed was different from what I wanted.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Bryan plays club and second XI cricket in England.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Pietersen attended <a href="Maritzburg_College" title="wikilink">Maritzburg College</a>, <a href="Pietermaritzburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pietermaritzburg</a>, and made his <a href="first-class_cricket" title="wikilink">first-class cricket</a> debut for <a href="KwaZulu_Natal_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Natal</a>'s B team in 1997, aged 17, where he was regarded predominantly as an <a href="off_spin" title="wikilink">off spin</a> bowler and a hard-hitting lower-order batsman.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> After two seasons, he moved to England for a five-month spell as the overseas player for club side <a href="Cannock" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cannock</a> CC, helping them win the <a href="Birmingham_and_District_Premier_League" title="wikilink">Birmingham and District Premier League</a> in 2000.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> This first spell away from home did not leave him with fond memories for England, in particular &quot;those horrible Black Country accents&quot; referring to the dialect of the <a href="English_Midlands" title="wikilink">Midlands</a>, living in a single room above a squash court, and working in the club bar.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> However, he returned to newly renamed <a href="KwaZulu_Natal_cricket_team" title="wikilink">KwaZulu Natal</a> side a better cricketer; a lack of opportunities to bowl had improved his batting.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Having seen Pietersen play at a school cricket festival, <a href="Clive_Rice" title="wikilink">Clive Rice</a> invited him to sign for <a href="Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club</a>. Pietersen accepted without hesitation, keen to make the most of top-class cricket under a coach for whom he had the utmost admiration. He did not at this stage contemplate forsaking his nation; nor had it yet occurred to him that the decision would eventually have to be taken.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Pietersen is widely portrayed in the media as having a self-assured personality, described by <a href="Geoffrey_Boycott" title="wikilink">Geoffrey Boycott</a> as being &quot;cocky and confident&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Former England test captain <a href="Michael_Vaughan" title="wikilink">Michael Vaughan</a> counters this, saying, &quot;KP is not a confident person. He obviously has great belief in his ability but that's not quite the same thing... And I know KP wants to be loved. I try to text him and talk to him as often as I can because I know he is insecure.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He has been noted for unusual haircuts, with his peroxide blond dyed streak of hair along the middle of his head during the <a href="2005_Ashes_series" title="wikilink">2005 Ashes series</a> being described as a &quot;dead skunk&quot; look.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> During the <a href="2006-07_Ashes" title="wikilink">2006&lt;U+2013&gt;07 Ashes</a> tour, the Australian team, noted for their efforts to dominate opponents psychologically, dubbed him &quot;The Ego&quot;, or &quot;FIGJAM&quot; (Fuck I'm Good, Just Ask Me).<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Other <a href="nickname" title="wikilink">nicknames</a> include <em>KP</em>, <em>Kelves</em> and <em>Kapes</em>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Kevin Pietersen published his autobiography: <em>Kevin Pietersen: Crossing the Boundary</em> in early 2007. A second biography: <em>Kevin Pietersen: Portrait of a Rebel</em> written by journalist Marcus Stead, was published in the autumn of 2009. This book includes a detailed account of the controversies of Pietersen's reign as England captain.</p>
<p>Pietersen is married to <a href="Liberty_X" title="wikilink">Liberty X</a> singer <a href="Jessica_Taylor_(Liberty_X)" title="wikilink">Jessica Taylor</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The couple married on 29 December 2007 at St Andrew's Church in <a href="Castle_Combe" title="wikilink">Castle Combe</a>, Wiltshire, with former England team-mate <a href="Darren_Gough" title="wikilink">Darren Gough</a> acting as best man.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Their first child, Dylan Blake Pietersen, was born on 10 May 2010.</p>
<h2 id="domestic-career">Domestic career</h2>
<p>He impressed members of <a href="Nasser_Hussain" title="wikilink">Nasser Hussain</a>'s England side when playing for <a href="KwaZulu_Natal_cricket_team" title="wikilink">KwaZulu Natal</a> in 1999; he took four top-order wickets and, despite batting at number nine, scored 61 <a href="not_out" title="wikilink">not out</a> from 57 balls, hitting four sixes.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Hussain then recommended that Pietersen secure a contract with an English county side.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the praise from the England side, Pietersen claimed he was dropped from the Natal first team. Pietersen felt that this was due to the country's <a href="racial_quota" title="wikilink">racial quota</a> system, in which provincial sides were required to have at least four non-white players.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Pietersen's view was that players should be judged on merit, and described it as &quot;heartbreaking&quot; when he was left out of the side, although he later reflected &quot;it turned out it was the best thing that could have happened&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Pietersen has since firmly criticised the quota system,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> which he feels forced him out of the country of his birth. He has also criticised <a href="Graeme_Smith" title="wikilink">Graeme Smith</a>, who became captain of the South African side in 2003, calling him &quot;an absolute muppet, childish and strange&quot; and that his behaviour &quot;leaves a lot to be desired&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Smith opposed this, saying, &quot;I'm patriotic about my country, and that's why I don't like Kevin Pietersen. The only reason that Kevin and I have never had a relationship is because he slated South Africa&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Pietersen's outspoken views published in his autobiography, <em>Crossing the Boundary</em>, in September 2006, and in an interview for South African magazine <em><a href="GQ_(magazine)" title="wikilink">GQ</a></em>, led to unsuccessful calls for an <a href="International_Cricket_Council" title="wikilink">ICC</a> investigation regarding bringing the game into disrepute.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2000, <a href="Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Nottinghamshire</a> coach <a href="Clive_Rice" title="wikilink">Clive Rice</a>, who had seen Pietersen play in 1997 in South Africa at a schools week, heard that Pietersen was playing club cricket for the Cannock Cricket Club and offered him a three-year contract to play for the county.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> His maiden first-class century came on his Nottinghamshire debut against <a href="Loughborough_UCCE" title="wikilink">Loughborough UCCE</a>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> In his first season he made 1,275 runs with an impressive <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">batting average</a> of 57.95,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> including 218 not out in an unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 352 with <a href="John_Morris_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">John Morris</a> at <a href="Derby" class="uri" title="wikilink">Derby</a> in July, after having been out <a href="Leg_before_wicket" title="wikilink">lbw</a> for a <a href="duck_(cricket)" title="wikilink">duck</a> in the first innings.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> These performances led to praise in the <em><a href="Wisden_Cricketers&#39;_Almanack" title="wikilink">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a></em>: &quot;If he can maintain his first season's form, the name of Pietersen should be pencilled in for future Test squads.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> This form did indeed continue into the following year: he made another unbeaten double-century, against <a href="Middlesex_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Middlesex</a>, taking part in a partnership of 316 for the fourth wicket with <a href="Darren_Bicknell" title="wikilink">Darren Bicknell</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> This period proved to be a <a href="purple_prose" title="wikilink">purple patch</a> for the batsman, scoring four consecutive centuries (254 not out, 122, 147 and 116) in one week in August.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2003, Pietersen scored 1,546 <a href="first-class_cricket" title="wikilink">first-class</a> runs, and 764 runs in <a href="limited_overs_cricket" title="wikilink">limited overs cricket</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> He was selected for the 2003/04 <a href="ECB_National_Academy" title="wikilink">ECB National Academy</a> tour of India, and had a successful tour scoring 523 runs including three centuries in his six first-class innings to record an average of 104.60,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> and making 131 in a one-day match against India A in <a href="Bangalore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bangalore</a>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>After Nottinghamshire were relegated in 2003, Pietersen requested a release from his contract, saying &quot;I haven't been happy for a while....The pitch at <a href="Trent_Bridge" title="wikilink">Trent Bridge</a> has been one of my problems... I could have done so much better if the wicket had been good.&quot;<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> This led to a public row with club captain <a href="Jason_Gallian" title="wikilink">Jason Gallian</a>, where Gallian allegedly threw Pietersen's kit off the <a href="Trent_Bridge" title="wikilink">Trent Bridge</a> balcony and broke his bat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the game I told the captain that I was not happy and that I wanted to leave. After the game we spoke in the dressing room and then I went to have dinner. I got a call saying the captain had trashed my equipment. I was told the captain had said, 'if he does not want to play for Notts he can f*** off.' I have not spoken to Gallian since, nor have I received an apology.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pietersen was made to honour the last year of his contract at Nottinghamshire, but &quot;didn't enjoy it at all&quot;.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> In October 2004, he joined <a href="Hampshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Hampshire</a> under the captaincy of <a href="Shane_Warne" title="wikilink">Shane Warne</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>After becoming a regular in the national side, Pietersen rarely gets an opportunity to play domestic cricket. Having an England &quot;central contract&quot; meant that Pietersen was only released to play for Hampshire at the discretion of the national coach. After being left out of the national side to face <a href="Bangladesh_national_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Bangladesh</a> in May 2005, Pietersen had several good innings in the English <a href="County_Championship" title="wikilink">County Championship</a>, including two centuries.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> He only played twice for the county in 2006, and appeared just once in 2007, with an unbeaten 66 against <a href="Ireland_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Pietersen's last first-class match for Hampshire came in the <a href="2008_County_Championship" title="wikilink">2008 County Championship</a> against <a href="Somerset_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Somerset</a>, where he scored 100 runs in Hampshire's first innings,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> and following the birth of his son, a desire to stay in London led to him announcing he would leave Hampshire at the end of the 2010 season.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>Pietersen then joined <a href="Surrey_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Surrey</a> on loan from Hampshire for the remainder of the 2010 English county cricket season.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> He scored a century in his first <a href="Clydesdale_Bank_40" title="wikilink">Clydesdale Bank 40</a> appearance against <a href="Sussex_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Sussex</a>, with 116 off 105 deliveries.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> It was his first limited overs century <a href="English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09" title="wikilink">since 2008</a>, and his first century of any kind <a href="English_cricket_team_in_West_Indies_in_2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09" title="wikilink">since March 2009</a>. He subsequently signed permanently for Surrey from the 2011 season onwards, noting his delight for having joined the club.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Pietersen had also rejoined his old team in South Africa, the Dolphins, for a short stint in October 2010.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>The tour of <a href="Zimbabwe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zimbabwe</a> caused several players to voice their concerns about the <a href="Robert_Mugabe" title="wikilink">Robert Mugabe</a> regime, the security issues in the country and the standard of the <a href="Zimbabwe_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Zimbabwean</a> side.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> <a href="Steve_Harmison" title="wikilink">Steve Harmison</a> was the first to boycott the tour for &quot;political and sporting reasons&quot;,<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> and all-rounder <a href="Andrew_Flintoff" title="wikilink">Andrew Flintoff</a> was reported to be considering taking a moral stand himself.

He made little impact in the first and third test. His first Test match innings since his match winning 158 against Australia was brief as he was caught at short leg for 5. In the second innings, he was criticised for his dismissal. Chasing just 198, he was caught behind after a horrible slog on 19 as England went onto lose by 22 runs. In the third test, he made 34 before edging behind in the first innings. With England indifficulty, Pietersen edged <a href="Danish_Kaneria" title="wikilink">Danish Kaneria</a> to short leg when only on one, as England were to be defeated by an innings.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a><a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> He fared better in the second, however, making his second Test century in the first innings. He brought up his hundred with a six before next ball, he top-edged a pull and was out.

His 87 in the second innings of the first match came during England's acceleration period, helping push the required target over 300.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> England then declared overnight, and India successfully batted out the final day to secure a draw. This half-century was followed by another in the first innings of the second Test. Again, he gave his wicket away on 64 when he offered <a href="Munaf_Patel" title="wikilink">Munaf Patel</a> a return catch. The second innings was not so good, facing just 13 balls before being given out <a href="caught_behind" title="wikilink">caught behind</a> off a <a href="Harbhajan_Singh" title="wikilink">Harbhajan Singh</a> delivery.

<p>Pietersen played in the first Test against <a href="India_national_cricket_team" title="wikilink">India</a> and in the first innings, he made 37 but not without controversy. He edged the ball behind of <a href="Zaheer_Khan" title="wikilink">Zaheer Khan</a> to Dhoni. He walked, but after seeing replays on the screen, he walked back to the middle and the decision was overturned. Ironically, he was out shortly afterwards caught Dhoni, bowled Khan. In the second innings he was top scorer with a knock of 134 to set up a potential England victory. Pietersen described this as his best century, in very testing conditions.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> In the second test, he was twice lbw to <a href="RP_Singh" title="wikilink">RP Singh</a> for 13 and 19 in a defeat which subsequently cost them the series. After making 41 in the first innings, Pietersen scored his 10th Test century in the third and final Test at the Oval, helping England to draw the game with 101.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> In the one-day series that followed, he struggled at the start with a top score of 33 not out in the first five matches of the series. He scored two half-centuries in the final matches including 71 not out in the final match at Lord's, hitting the winning runs to give England the series.</p>
<p>Pietersen was also picked for and played in the Twenty20 Championship in South Africa. In England's first game against Zimbabwe on 13 September, Pietersen hit 79 runs off 37 balls, his highest Twenty20 score, including seven fours and four sixes (one of them being another switch-hit sweep for six) in an English total of 188&lt;U+2013&gt;9. England won the match by 50 runs; however, this was to be Pietersen's largest contribution in the competition. He scored another 99 runs over four more matches, ending the series with an average of 35.60. He also scored the most England fours (17) and jointly held the record for the most England sixes (6) with <a href="Owais_Shah" title="wikilink">Owais Shah</a>. He also held the highest strike rate of any England batsman.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>

<p>Pietersen scored 50 in England's opening game in Sri Lanka against the Sri Lankan Cricket XI,<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> but it took until the fourth ODI for Pietersen to find form, scoring 63 not out as England won their first series in Sri Lanka.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> This form was still fluctuating in the warm-up matches for the Test series, scoring 4, 1 and 59 against the Sri Lankan Cricket XI. This run continued in the Test matches when in the first test he got two starts with 31 and 18 but didn't go on. He was unfortunate as in the second innings on 18 he was bowled by a ball that kept low from <a href="Dilhara_Fernando" title="wikilink">Dilhara Fernando</a>. In the second test he managed 45 not out to secure a draw in the 2nd Test. In the first innings, Pietersen's dismissal was to be the source of much controversy. He edged his fifth ball to <a href="Chamara_Silva" title="wikilink">Chamara Silva</a> at slip, who flicked the ball up for wicketkeeper <a href="Kumar_Sangakkara" title="wikilink">Kumar Sangakkara</a> to complete the catch. The two on-field umpires conferred over the validity of the catch, as it was unclear whether the ball had touched the ground <em>prior</em> to Silva flicking the ball up. <a href="Daryl_Harper" title="wikilink">Daryl Harper</a>, standing at the bowler's end gave the decision that the wicket had been taken, but while walking off the field, Pietersen saw a replay on the big screen and questioned the validity of the decision. This led for calls for similar catches to be referred to the third (TV) umpire, but this can only take place if the on-field umpires have not made a decision.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> Pietersen passed 3,000 Test runs during the series, becoming the fastest player (by time) to do so,<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a><a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> He only averaged 25.20, and failed to score a half century in a series for the first time.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>

<p>On England's tour against <a href="New_Zealand_cricket_team" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a>, Pietersen averaged 33.00 in the ODI series, with one score of 50 in the tied fourth match; England lost the series 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> He also made a top score of 43 in the first of two comfortable <a href="Twenty20_International" title="wikilink">Twenty20</a> matches.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> Pietersen had a quiet first two Test matches, making little impression with the bat. He produced 42 and 6 as England collapsed in their second innings. In the next test, he fared little better making 31 and 17. However, in the first innings of the <a href="McLean_Park" title="wikilink">Napier</a> Test he rescued England from a disastrous start of 4-3, guiding them to 259 with 129, his 11th Test century.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>
<p>New Zealand then came to tour England and Pietersen again struggled in the first two Test matches, scoring 3 in the first match. He improved slightly in the second but only making 26 in the first innings and then running himself out on 42 having looked well set.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> He seemed to be struggling particularly against <a href="Daniel_Vettori" title="wikilink">Daniel Vettori</a> but he showed no signs of that as he struck a century in the third Test, forming a valuable partnership with <a href="Tim_Ambrose" title="wikilink">Tim Ambrose</a>, making a crucial 115.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> Pietersen hit a winning 42 not out in the Twenty20 match.</p>
<h4 id="the-switch-hit">The switch-hit</h4>
<p>In the first ODI of the NatWest series, Pietersen hit two sixes by &quot;switch-hitting&quot; en route to 110 not out. While facing the bowling of medium pace <a href="Scott_Styris" title="wikilink">Scott Styris</a>, Pietersen turned his body around and switched hands (effectively batting as a left-hander) hitting two sixes over <a href="Fielding_(cricket)" title="wikilink">cover</a> and long off. Because Pietersen not only reversed his hand position (as some batsman do while playing the <a href="Batting_(cricket)#Reverse_sweep" title="wikilink">reverse sweep</a>), but changed his stance by rotating his body, these &quot;switch-hit&quot; shots were immediately followed by calls to outlaw them from the game.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> Although a similar shot was played when Pietersen reverse-swept <a href="Muttiah_Muralitharan" title="wikilink">Muttiah Muralitharan</a> for six in Sri Lanka in 2006, he only switched hands and executed &quot;the switch&quot; after the ball was bowled, and not before, as in this case.</p>
<p>Several commentators claim that because Pietersen changed from being a right-handed to a left-handed batsman as the bowler approached his delivery stride, he was gaining an unfair advantage. <a href="Gideon_Haigh" title="wikilink">Gideon Haigh</a> said that &quot;A bowler must advise a batsman when he's changing direction, why should the batsmen not; given that where the bowler's aiming will depend on the placement of the off stump&quot;. <a href="Ian_Healy" title="wikilink">Ian Healy</a> seconded this by saying &quot;It just should be outlawed straightaway. If you want to hit to one side of the field, you've got to do it in a cross fashion, and not swap the way you're facing or your grip. Otherwise you are going to start to allow the bowlers to go round the wicket, over the wicket, and keep swapping during their run-ups.&quot; This ideal was echoed by former fast-bowler <a href="Michael_Holding" title="wikilink">Michael Holding</a>, who rather than calling for the shot to be banned, advocated the latter scenario whereby bowlers do not have to inform the umpire, or batsman, of a change of delivery.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
<p>Pietersen countered these claims by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;That's ridiculous, absolutely stupid. The reverse-sweep has been part of the game for however long. I am just fortunate that I am able to hit it a bit further. Everybody wants brand new ideas, new inventions and new shots. That is a new shot played today and people should be saying it's a new way to go. There are new things happening for cricket at the moment and people shouldn't be criticising it all the time.&quot;<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another citation for the shot being outlawed was that the possibility of being out LBW (&quot;a player is out LBW if...the ball pitches in line between wicket and wicket or on the off side of the striker's wicket&quot;) is removed, as the off side become the leg side and vice versa.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> The shots were considered by the <a href="Marylebone_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">MCC</a>, governors of the game, who came to the conclusion that the shot was legal, believing that the LBW law (which continues &quot;The off side of the striker's wicket shall be determined by the striker's stance at the moment the ball comes into play for that delivery&quot;) adequately covers the scenario.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a><a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> They cited the variations bowlers can make, such as bowling a googly or a slower ball, and also the inherent risk in the shot to the batsman, in the justification of their decision.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a></p>
<p>There are still calls for further review of the stroke, with <a href="Jonathan_Agnew" title="wikilink">Jonathan Agnew</a> giving a scenario in which a right-handed batsman can take his stance as a left-hander, then switch stance as the bowler runs in, thus being able to kick away any balls that land outside his now off stump. He also calls for the wide law to be adjusted in one-day cricket, as bowlers are penalised for most deliveries that pass down the leg side.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a></p>

During the third Test against South Africa, Pietersen was criticized for throwing his wicket away attempting a six to complete a century when on 94. <a href="Jonathan_Agnew" title="wikilink">Jonathan Agnew</a> and <a href="Alec_Stewart" title="wikilink">Alec Stewart</a> called the stroke &quot;irresponsible&quot; and Agnew continued, suggesting that Pietersen therefore ruled himself out of the potential reckoning for the England captaincy with <a href="Michael_Vaughan" title="wikilink">Vaughan</a>'s place in the starting line-up in doubt after failing to score runs.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> In the event, having lost the match, Vaughan resigned and Pietersen was made the permanent captain of both the Test and ODI sides (<a href="Paul_Collingwood" title="wikilink">Paul Collingwood</a> relinquished the ODI captaincy at the same time).<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> Following the news that he had been made England Test and ODI captain, Pietersen paid tribute to both outgoing captains but announced that he would look to captain the team in his own style.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> He scored a century in his debut match as captain in the <a href="dead_rubber" title="wikilink">dead rubber</a> fourth Test, and went on to defeat South Africa 4&lt;U+2013&gt;0 in the ODI matches.

<h5 id="derailment-against-india">Derailment against India</h5>
<p>Pietersen continued to lead the team during a 5&lt;U+2013&gt;0 defeat to India in ODI matches; the series was supposed to consist of seven matches, but was abandoned after the fifth due to the <a href="2008_Mumbai_attacks" title="wikilink">2008 Mumbai attacks</a>. Pietersen however had a decent series with the bat hitting a quick 63 in the first match and 111 not out in the fifth match. Pietersen's men returned to England before resuming the tour amid unprecedented security, to play a two-Test series. Pietersen was highly vocal in regards to the resumption of the tour, citing a need to stand up to terrorism. He had an aggregate of 5 runs in 2 innings in the first test being dismissed by <a href="Yuvraj_Singh" title="wikilink">Yuvraj Singh</a> in the second innings which showed Pietersen's struggles against Yuvraj from the ODI series carried on.

Moores and Pietersen were believed to be in disagreement on several issues, including the team's training regimen, and the possible selection of former England captain <a href="Michael_Vaughan" title="wikilink">Michael Vaughan</a> for the upcoming <a href="English_cricket_team_in_West_Indies_in_2008-09" title="wikilink">tour of the West Indies</a>.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> On 7 January 2009, Moores was removed as England's coach by the ECB, and Pietersen unexpectedly resigned as captain.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> In the immediate aftermath of Pietersen's resignation, several commentators connected with English cricket indicated that they believed that Pietersen had miscalculated by openly advocating for the removal of Moores, particularly in making their dispute public.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> In an interview several days after his resignation, Pietersen revealed that he had not intended to resign as captain, but was told by ECB officials that he was resigning.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> <a href="Dennis_Amiss" title="wikilink">Dennis Amiss</a>, the vice-chairman of the ECB, went on record backing up Pietersen in his statement that the story of the rift with Moores had not been leaked to the media by him, saying, &quot;We don't believe Kevin Pietersen leaked the information, we understand his frustration at it being leaked by other parties.&quot;<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> Pietersen was captain for three Test matches, and 10 One Day International matches.

<p><img src="Kp_walks_out.JPG" title="fig:Pietersen walks out to bat against Australia at the Rose Bowl in his 100th ODI." alt="Pietersen walks out to bat against Australia at the Rose Bowl in his 100th ODI." /> Pietersen played in the Bangladesh home series, however contributed only 18 in the first innings before assisting England in chasing down a modest total with 10*. He made 64 in the second Test, however.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> After the Test series, attention was drawn to Pietersen's lack of games for Hampshire - having not played a County Championship at the Rose Bowl since 2005. Having made one Twenty20 appearance for them against <a href="Surrey_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Surrey</a> after the Bangladesh Test series, it was announced that he would be leaving Hampshire, stating that &quot;Geographically it just doesn't work. I live in Chelsea.&quot;<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> On June 22, Pietersen played his 100th ODI against Australia at his home ground, <a href="Rose_Bowl,_Southampton" title="wikilink">the Rose Bowl</a>. <img src="Kevin_Pietersen_Trent_Bridge.JPG" title="fig:Pietersen bowled for 9 in the first Test v Pakistan at Trent Bridge July 2010" alt="Pietersen bowled for 9 in the first Test v Pakistan at Trent Bridge July 2010" /></p>
<p>Pietersen struggled for form in an <a href="Australian_cricket_team_in_England_in_2010" title="wikilink">ODI series against Australia</a> and then a <a href="Pakistani_cricket_team_in_England_in_2010" title="wikilink">Test series against Pakistan</a>. England beat Australia 3-2, but Pietersen could only manage a top-score of 33. England beat Pakistan 3-1, and although Pietersen top-scored for England with 80 in the second Test, it was the only time he passed 50 and ended the series with a golden duck. His poor form, and an admission by Pietersen before the final Test that he was low on confidence, led to many in the media, including <a href="Geoffrey_Boycott" title="wikilink">Geoffrey Boycott</a>, to suggest that Pietersen could do with playing County Cricket to regain his form before the <a href="2010&lt;U+2013&gt;11_Ashes_series" title="wikilink">2010&lt;U+2013&gt;11 Ashes series</a>.</p>
<p>Pietersen was omitted from both of England's limited-overs squads to face Pakistan. However, the ECB brokered a loan move to <a href="Surrey_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Surrey</a> for the remainder of the <a href="2010_English_cricket_season" title="wikilink">2010 English cricket season</a> which enables him to play first-class cricket whilst the England side plays Pakistan in the limited overs leg of the tour. Pietersen announced the omission and loan-move to Surrey early through a Twitter message, which contained a swear-word and was quickly removed, and he apologised the following day. The online outburst drew some criticism of him, with national selector <a href="Geoff_Miller" title="wikilink">Geoff Miller</a> one of those criticising the message. During the lead up to the 2010/11 Ashes Series Pietersen signed up for two first class games in the South African competition with the KwaZulu Natal Dolphins.</p>
<h4 id="the-ashes-down-under">The Ashes down under</h4>
<p>Pietersen went into the <a href="2010-11_Ashes_series" title="wikilink">2010-11 Ashes series</a> without a century since March 2009, and many felt that England would be unable to retain the Ashes unless he found form. In the first Test at <a href="The_Gabba" title="wikilink">The Gabba</a>, <a href="Brisbane" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brisbane</a>, Pietersen hit 43 in the first innings but wasn't required in the second as England posted 517-1 declared before a draw was declared.</p>
<p>In the second Test in <a href="Adelaide" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adelaide</a>, where he hit 158 on the previous Ashes tour, Pietersen joined opener <a href="Alastair_Cook" title="wikilink">Alastair Cook</a> (148) to make an century partnership before going onto to score his 17th Test century. He finished with 227, a Test-best and his second Test double-century, as England declared on 620-5. Given a rare bowl at the end of the fourth day, Pietersen claimed the wicket of <a href="Michael_Clarke_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Michael Clarke</a> (80) to leave Australia 238-4. England then proceeded to bowl Australia out in the final morning to win by an innings and 71 runs, and Pietersen was named man-of-the-match.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a></p>
