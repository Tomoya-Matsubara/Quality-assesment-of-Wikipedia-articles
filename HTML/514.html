<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The <em>William B. Tennison</em> was built as a nine-log sailing bugeye, using pitch pine logs,  thick at the keel and tapering to  at the outer edges. She is  long on deck and has a beam of  with a draft of .The hullform is flat-bottomed with rounded chines, and is sharp at each end. Framing and planking are built up above the logs for freeboard, using oak frames at approximate  centers. A bulhead separates the foc'sle from the hold. A second blunkhead was added when she was converted to power between the hold nd the engine compartment. At the same time the <a href="centerboard" class="uri" title="wikilink">centerboard</a> trunk was removed. A &quot;patent stern&quot; was added to sqaure the deck above the sharp stern and add working space. A portion of the rudder has been cut away to allow for a propeller.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>For her conversion to a buy-boat the <em>Tennison</em>s mainmast and the running rigging to the foremast, necessary for sailing, were removed. The foremast was then used to hoist bushel-sized oyster baskets from other vessels to the hold using two gaff-rigged booms. A pilothouse with a rounded from was added, as is typical in Chesapeake Bay buy-boats. Three windows occupy the front, with one window and a door on each side. The pilothouse is covered with vertical tongue and groove cypress siding. Two bunks are on the port side aft, along with an enclosed head aft. A floor hatch gives access to the engine compartment. The foc'sle once housed three bunks, a table and a cookstove.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The <em>William B. Tennison</em> was built in 1899 by Frank Laird of <a href="Monie,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Monie, Maryland</a> at Crabb Island, near <a href="Oriole,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Oriole, Maryland</a>. She was built relatively late for a bugeye, as the type was going out of style in favor of the smaller, cheaper <a href="skipjack_(boat)" title="wikilink">skipjack</a>. Benjamin P. and Rufus L. Miles of Monie used her as an oyster dredge until 1908-09 when she was converted to power. In 1910 the <em>Tennison</em> was sold to Alphonse Lafayette Hazelwood of <a href="Eclipse,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Eclipse, Virginia</a> who used her to haul produce in the <a href="Norfolk,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Norfolk</a> and <a href="Albemarle_Sound" title="wikilink">Albemarle Sound</a> area until 1930. During the oyster season she was used as a buy-boat. Her original 37 horsepower engine was replaced with a 60 horsepower engine during this time. She was sold to Barney B. Winnal of <a href="Carrollton,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Carrollton, Virginia</a> in 1933 for $2050. After her sale to O.A. Bloxom of the Battery Park Fish and Oyster Company near <a href="Smithfield,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Smithfield, Virginia</a>, she was sold in 1944 to J.C Lore and Sons of <a href="Solomons,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Solomons, Maryland</a>. The Lores used <em>Tennison</em> to dredge oysters on their private beds, where power could be used, and as a buy-boat.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>Tennison</em> was partially rebuilt at the H. Krentz Railway in <a href="Harryhogan,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Harryhogan, Virginia</a> in 1952. The pilot house was rebuilt during this time. She was beached by <a href="Hurricane_Hazel" title="wikilink">Hurricane Hazel</a> in 1952, and the scar from being dragged over an obstruction to refloat her is reputedly still visible when she is hauled out of the water. In 1955 a Grey Marine 155-horsepower diesel engine was installed, possibly having been taken from a naval landing craft. She was converted to a passenger boat in 1977, with nearly all of the structural frames replaced at that time.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The identity of her namesake, William B. Tennison, remains unknown.</p>
