The park, located 120 kilometres (80 <a href="Mile" title="wikilink">mi</a>) west of <a href="Calgary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calgary</a> in the province of <a href="Alberta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alberta</a>, encompasses 6,641 <a href="square_kilometre" title="wikilink">square kilometres</a> (2,564 <a href="Square_mile" title="wikilink">sq mi</a>)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> of mountainous terrain, with numerous <a href="glacier" title="wikilink">glaciers</a> and <a href="ice_field" title="wikilink">ice fields</a>, dense <a href="pinophyta" title="wikilink">coniferous</a> forest, and alpine landscapes. The <a href="Icefields_Parkway" title="wikilink">Icefields Parkway</a> extends from <a href="Lake_Louise,_Alberta" title="wikilink">Lake Louise</a>, connecting to <a href="Jasper_National_Park" title="wikilink">Jasper National Park</a> in the north. Provincial forests and <a href="Yoho_National_Park" title="wikilink">Yoho National Park</a> are neighbours to the west, while <a href="Kootenay_National_Park" title="wikilink">Kootenay National Park</a> is located to the south and <a href="Kananaskis_Country" title="wikilink">Kananaskis Country</a> to the southeast. The main commercial centre of the park is the town of <a href="Banff,_Alberta" title="wikilink">Banff</a>, in the <a href="Bow_River" title="wikilink">Bow River</a> valley.</p>
<p>The <a href="Canadian_Pacific_Railway" title="wikilink">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> was instrumental in Banff's early years, building the <a href="Banff_Springs_Hotel" title="wikilink">Banff Springs Hotel</a> and <a href="Chateau_Lake_Louise" title="wikilink">Chateau Lake Louise</a>, and attracting tourists through extensive advertising. In the early 20th century, roads were built in Banff, at times by war internees, and through <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a>-era public works projects. Since the 1960s, park accommodations have been open all year, with annual tourism visits to Banff increasing to over 5 million in the 1990s.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Millions more pass through the park on the <a href="Trans-Canada_Highway" title="wikilink">Trans-Canada Highway</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> As Banff is one of the world's most visited national parks,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> the health of its ecosystem has been threatened. In the mid-1990s, <a href="Parks_Canada" title="wikilink">Parks Canada</a> responded by initiating a two-year study, which resulted in management recommendations, and new policies that aim to preserve ecological integrity.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Throughout its history, Banff National Park has been shaped by tension between <a href="conservation_movement" title="wikilink">conservation</a> and <a href="Subdivision_(land)" title="wikilink">development</a> interests. The park was established in 1885, in response to conflicting claims over who discovered <a href="hot_springs" title="wikilink">hot springs</a> there, and who had the right to develop the hot springs for commercial interests. Instead, prime minister <a href="John_A._Macdonald" title="wikilink">John A. Macdonald</a> set aside the hot springs as a small protected reserve, which was later expanded to include <a href="Lake_Louise_(Alberta)" title="wikilink">Lake Louise</a> and other areas extending north to the <a href="Columbia_Icefield" title="wikilink">Columbia Icefields</a>.</p>

<h3 id="rocky-mountains-park-established">Rocky Mountains Park established</h3>
<p>With conflicting claims over discovery of hot springs in Banff, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald decided to set aside a small reserve of 26 square kilometres (10 sq mi) around the hot springs at <a href="Cave_and_Basin" title="wikilink">Cave and Basin</a> as a public park in 1885. Under the <a href="Rocky_Mountains_Park_Act" title="wikilink">Rocky Mountains Park Act</a>, enacted on <a href="23_June" title="wikilink">23 June</a> <a href="1887" class="uri" title="wikilink">1887</a>, the park was expanded to 674 square kilometres (260 sq mi)<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and named <em>Rocky Mountains Park</em>. This was Canada's first <a href="Canadian_National_Parks" title="wikilink">national park</a>, and the second established in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a>, after <a href="Yellowstone_National_Park" title="wikilink">Yellowstone National Park</a>. The Canadian Pacific Railway built the <a href="Banff_Springs_Hotel" title="wikilink">Banff Springs Hotel</a> and <a href="Chateau_Lake_Louise" title="wikilink">Chateau Lake Louise</a> to attract tourists and increase the number of rail passengers. <img src="Banff_springs_hotel_1902.jpg" title="fig:Banff Springs Hotel, 1902" alt="Banff Springs Hotel, 1902" width="250" /> Early on, Banff was popular with wealthy <a href="Europe" title="wikilink">European</a> tourists, who arrived in Canada via trans-Atlantic <a href="luxury_liner" title="wikilink">luxury liner</a> and continued westward on the railroad,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> as well as upper-class American and English tourists. Some visitors participated in <a href="mountaineering" class="uri" title="wikilink">mountaineering</a> activities, often hiring local <a href="guide" title="wikilink">guides</a>. <a href="Tom_Wilson_(mountaineer)" title="wikilink">Tom Wilson</a>, along with Jim and Bill Brewster, was among the first outfitters in Banff. The <a href="Alpine_Club_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Alpine Club of Canada</a>, established in 1906 by <a href="Arthur_Oliver_Wheeler" title="wikilink">Arthur Oliver Wheeler</a> and <a href="Elizabeth_Parker_(journalist)" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Parker</a>, organized <a href="mountain_climbing" title="wikilink">climbs</a> and camps in the backcountry. <img src="Cpr_rockies_ad.jpg" title="fig:Canadian Pacific Railway advertising brochure, highlighting Mount Assiniboine and Banff scenery (c. 1917)" alt="Canadian Pacific Railway advertising brochure, highlighting Mount Assiniboine and Banff scenery (c. 1917)" width="250" /> By 1911, Banff was accessible by <a href="automobile" class="uri" title="wikilink">automobile</a> from Calgary. Beginning in 1916, the Brewsters offered <a href="motorcoach" class="uri" title="wikilink">motorcoach</a> tours of Banff.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In 1920, access to Lake Louise by road was available, and the Banff-Windermere Road opened in 1923 to connect Banff with <a href="British_Columbia" title="wikilink">British Columbia</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1902, the park was expanded to cover 11,400 square kilometres (4,402 sq mi), encompassing areas around Lake Louise, and the <a href="Bow_River" title="wikilink">Bow</a>, <a href="Red_Deer_River" title="wikilink">Red Deer</a>, <a href="Kananaskis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kananaskis</a>, and <a href="Spray_River" title="wikilink">Spray</a> rivers. Bowing to pressure from <a href="grazing" class="uri" title="wikilink">grazing</a> and <a href="logging" class="uri" title="wikilink">logging</a> interests, the size of the park was reduced in 1911 to 4,663 square kilometres (1,800 sq mi), eliminating many foothills areas from the park. Park boundaries changed several more times up until 1930, when the size of Banff was fixed at 6,697 square kilometres (2,586 sq mi), with the passage of the <a href="National_Parks_Act_(Canada)" title="wikilink">National Parks Act</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The Act also renamed the park as <em>Banff National Park</em>, named for the <a href="Canadian_Pacific_Railway" title="wikilink">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> station, which in turn was named after the <a href="Banffshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Banffshire</a> region in <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> With the construction of a new east gate in 1933, Alberta transferred 0.84 square kilometres (207.5 acres) to the park. This, along with other minor changes in the park boundaries in 1949, set the area of the park at 6,641 square kilometres (2,564 sq mi).<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="coal-mining">Coal mining</h3>
<p>In 1887, <a href="aboriginal_people_in_Canada" title="wikilink">local aboriginal tribes</a> signed <a href="Treaty_7" title="wikilink">Treaty 7</a>, which gave Canada rights to explore the land for resources.

<p><img src="Castle_mountain_camp_1915.jpg" title="fig:Castle Mountain internment camp (1915)" alt="Castle Mountain internment camp (1915)" width="250" /> In 1931, the <a href="Government_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Government of Canada</a> enacted the <a href="Unemployment_and_Farm_Relief_Act" title="wikilink">Unemployment and Farm Relief Act</a> which provided <a href="public_works" title="wikilink">public works</a> projects in the <a href="national_parks" title="wikilink">national parks</a> during the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a>. In Banff, workers constructed a new bathhouse and pool at <a href="Upper_Hot_Springs" title="wikilink">Upper Hot Springs</a>, to supplement Cave and Basin.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Other projects involved road building in the park, tasks around the Banff townsite, and construction of a highway connecting Banff and <a href="Jasper,_Alberta" title="wikilink">Jasper</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In 1934, the <a href="Public_Works_Construction_Act" title="wikilink">Public Works Construction Act</a> was passed, providing continued funding for the public works projects.

By 1940, the Icefields Parkway reached the Columbia Icefield area of Banff, and connected Banff and Jasper.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Internment camps were once again set up in Banff during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, with camps stationed at Lake Louise, Stoney Creek, and Healy Creek.

<h3 id="winter-tourism">Winter tourism</h3>
<p>Winter tourism in Banff began in February 1917, with the first Banff Winter Carnival. The carnival featured a large ice palace, which in 1917 was built by internees. Carnival events included <a href="cross-country_skiing" title="wikilink">cross-country skiing</a>, <a href="ski_jumping" title="wikilink">ski jumping</a>, <a href="curling" class="uri" title="wikilink">curling</a>, <a href="snowshoe" class="uri" title="wikilink">snowshoe</a>, and <a href="skijoring" class="uri" title="wikilink">skijoring</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In the 1930s, the first <a href="downhill_skiing" title="wikilink">downhill ski</a> resort, <a href="Sunshine_Village" title="wikilink">Sunshine Village</a>, was developed by the Brewsters. <a href="Mount_Norquay" title="wikilink">Mount Norquay</a> ski area was also developed during the 1930s, with the first <a href="chair_lift" title="wikilink">chair lift</a> installed there in 1948.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> <img src="Banffnatpark.jpg" title="fig:Banff National Park panorama" alt="Banff National Park panorama" width="400" /> Since 1968, when Banff Springs Hotel was winterized, Banff has been a year-round destination.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In the 1960s, the Trans-Canada Highway was constructed, providing another transportation corridor through the Bow Valley, in addition to the Bow Valley Parkway, making the park more accessible. Also in the 1960s, <a href="Calgary_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Calgary International Airport</a> was built.</p>
<p>Canada launched several bids to host the <a href="Winter_Olympics" title="wikilink">Winter Olympics</a> in Banff, with the first bid for the <a href="1964_Winter_Olympics" title="wikilink">1964 Winter Olympics</a> which were eventually awarded to <a href="Innsbruck" class="uri" title="wikilink">Innsbruck</a>, <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a>.

<h3 id="conservation">Conservation</h3>
<p>Since the original Rocky Mountains Park Act, subsequent acts and policies placed greater emphasis on conservation. With public sentiment tending towards environmentalism, <a href="Parks_Canada" title="wikilink">Parks Canada</a> issued major new policy in 1979, which emphasized conservation. The National Parks Act was amended in 1988, which made preserving <a href="ecological_integrity" title="wikilink">ecological integrity</a> a top priority. The act also required each park to produce a management plan, with greater public participation.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1984, Banff was declared a <a href="UNESCO" class="uri" title="wikilink">UNESCO</a> <a href="World_Heritage_Site" title="wikilink">World Heritage Site</a>, together with the other national and <a href="provincial_park" title="wikilink">provincial parks</a> that form the <a href="Canadian_Rocky_Mountain_Parks" title="wikilink">Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks</a>, for the mountain landscapes containing mountain peaks, glaciers, lakes, waterfalls, <a href="canyon" title="wikilink">canyons</a> and limestone caves as well as <a href="fossil" title="wikilink">fossils</a> found here. With this designation came added obligations for conservation.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>During the 1980s, Parks Canada moved to privatize many park services such as golf courses, and added user fees for use of other facilities and services to help deal with budget cuts. In 1990, the <a href="Banff,_Alberta" title="wikilink">Town of Banff</a> was <a href="Municipal_corporation" title="wikilink">incorporated</a>, giving local residents more say regarding any proposed developments.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1990s, development plans for the park, including expansion at Sunshine Village, were under fire with lawsuits filed by <a href="Canadian_Parks_and_Wilderness_Society" title="wikilink">Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society</a> (CPAWS). In the mid-1990s, the Banff-Bow Valley Study was initiated to find ways to better address environmental concerns, and issues relating to development in the park.</p>

<p>North of Saskatchewan Crossing, the Icefields Parkway follows the North Saskatchewan River up to the <a href="Columbia_Icefield" title="wikilink">Columbia Icefield</a>. The Parkway crosses into Jasper National Park at Sunwapta Pass at 2,023 <a href="metre" title="wikilink">metres</a> (6,635 <a href="Foot_(unit)" title="wikilink">ft</a>) in elevation,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> and continues on from there to the Jasper townsite.</p>
<h2 id="geology">Geology</h2>
<p>The Canadian Rockies consist of several northwest-southeast trending ranges. Closely following the <a href="continental_divide" title="wikilink">continental divide</a>, the Main Ranges form the backbone of the Canadian Rockies. The Front Ranges are located east of the Main Ranges. Banff National Park extends eastward from the continental divide and includes the eastern slope of the Main Ranges and much of the Front Ranges. The latter include the mountains around the Banff townsite. The foothills are located to the east of the Park, between Calgary and Canmore. On the other side of the Park, the Western Ranges pass through Yoho and Kootenay National Parks. Still farther west is the <a href="Rocky_Mountain_Trench" title="wikilink">Rocky Mountain Trench</a>, the western boundary of the Canadian Rockies region in <a href="British_Columbia" title="wikilink">British Columbia</a>.</p>
<p>The Canadian Rockies are composed of <a href="sedimentary_rock" title="wikilink">sedimentary rock</a>, including <a href="shale" class="uri" title="wikilink">shale</a>, <a href="sandstone" class="uri" title="wikilink">sandstone</a>, <a href="limestone" class="uri" title="wikilink">limestone</a>, and <a href="quartzite" class="uri" title="wikilink">quartzite</a>, that originated as deposits in a shallow inland sea. The <a href="geologic_formation" title="wikilink">geologic formations</a> in Banff range in age from <a href="Precambrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Precambrian</a> eon to the <a href="Jurassic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jurassic</a> period. The mountains were formed 80&lt;U+2013&gt;120 million years ago, as a product of <a href="thrust_fault" title="wikilink">thrust faults</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> <img src="Castle_mountain_2003.jpg" title="fig:Castle Mountain" alt="Castle Mountain" width="250" /> Over the past 80 million years, <a href="erosion" class="uri" title="wikilink">erosion</a> has taken its toll on the landscape, with more extensive erosion occurring in the foothills and Front Range than in the Main Range.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Banff's mountains exhibit several different shapes that have been influenced by the composition of rock deposits, layers, and their structure. Numerous mountains in Banff are carved out of sedimentary layers that slope at 50&lt;U+2013&gt;60 degree angles.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Such <a href="dip_slope" title="wikilink">dip slope</a> mountains have one side with a steep face, and the other with a more gradual slope that follows the layering of the rock formations, e.g., <a href="Mount_Rundle" title="wikilink">Mount Rundle</a>, near the Banff townsite.</p>
<p>Other types of mountains in Banff include complex, irregular, <a href="anticline" title="wikilink">anticlinal</a>, <a href="syncline" title="wikilink">synclinal</a>, castellate, dogtooth, and sawback mountains.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> <a href="Castle_Mountain" title="wikilink">Castle Mountain</a> exemplifies a castellate shape, with steep slopes and cliffs.

Dogtooth mountains, such as <a href="Mount_Louis" title="wikilink">Mount Louis</a>, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The <a href="Sawback_Range" title="wikilink">Sawback Range</a>, which consists of dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross <a href="gully" title="wikilink">gullies</a>. <a href="Scree" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scree</a> deposits are common toward the bottom of many mountains and cliffs.</p>
<p>Banff's landscape has also been marked by glacial erosion, with deep <a href="U-shaped_valley" title="wikilink">U-shaped valleys</a> and many <a href="hanging_valley" title="wikilink">hanging valleys</a> that often form <a href="waterfall" title="wikilink">waterfalls</a>. Matterhorn-type mountains, such as <a href="Mount_Assiniboine" title="wikilink">Mount Assiniboine</a>, have been shaped by glacial erosion that has left a sharp peak. A number of small <a href="gorge" title="wikilink">gorges</a> also exist, including <a href="Mistaya_Canyon" title="wikilink">Mistaya Canyon</a> and <a href="Johnston_Canyon" title="wikilink">Johnston Canyon</a>.</p>
<h3 id="glaciers-and-icefields">Glaciers and icefields</h3>
<p>Banff National Park has numerous large glaciers and icefields, many of which are easily accessed from the Icefields Parkway. Small <a href="cirque_glacier" title="wikilink">cirque glaciers</a> are fairly common in the Main Ranges, situated in depressions on the side of many mountains. As with the majority of mountain glaciers around the world, the glaciers in Banff are retreating. Photographic evidence alone provides testimony to this retreat and the trend has become alarming enough that <a href="glaciologist" title="wikilink">glaciologists</a> have commenced researching the glaciers in the park more thoroughly, and have been analyzing the impact that reduced glacier ice may have on water supplies to streams and rivers. The largest glaciated areas include the <a href="Waputik_Icefield" title="wikilink">Waputik</a> and <a href="Wapta_Icefield" title="wikilink">Wapta Icefields</a>, which both lie on the Banff-Yoho National Park border.

<h2 id="park-management">Park management</h2>
<p>Banff National Park is managed by <a href="Parks_Canada" title="wikilink">Parks Canada</a>, under the <a href="National_Parks_Act_(Canada)" title="wikilink">National Parks Act</a> which was passed in 1930. Over time, park management policies have increasingly emphasized environmental protection over development. In 1964, a policy statement was issued that reiterated ideals of conservation laid out in the 1930 act. With the controversial bid for the 1972 Winter Olympics, environmental groups became more influential, leading Parks Canada to withdraw its support for the bid. The 1979 Beaver Book was a major new policy, which emphasized <a href="Conservation_ethic" title="wikilink">conservation</a>. In 1988, the National Parks Act was amended, making the maintenance of ecological integrity the top priority. The amendment also paved the way for <a href="non-governmental_organizations" title="wikilink">non-governmental organizations</a> to challenge Parks Canada in court, for breaches in adhering to the act.

Implementation of this development proposal was delayed through the 1980s, while environmental assessments were conducted. In 1989, Sunshine Village withdrew its development proposal, in light of government reservations, and submitted a revised proposal in 1992. This plan was approved by the government, pending environmental review. Subsequently, <a href="Canadian_Parks_and_Wilderness_Society" title="wikilink">Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society</a> (CPAWS) filed a court <a href="injunction" class="uri" title="wikilink">injunction</a>, which halted the development.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> CPAWS also put pressure on UNESCO to revoke Banff's World Heritage Site status, over concerns that developments were harming the park's ecological health.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="banff-bow-valley-study">Banff-Bow Valley Study</h3>
<p>While the National Parks Act and the 1988 amendment emphasize ecological integrity, in practice Banff has suffered from inconsistent application of the policies.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> In 1994, the Banff-Bow Valley Study was mandated by <a href="Sheila_Copps" title="wikilink">Sheila Copps</a>, the minister responsible for Parks Canada, to provide recommendations on how to better manage human use and development, and maintain ecological integrity.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> While the two-year Banff-Bow Valley Study was underway, development projects were halted, including the expansion of Sunshine Village, and the <a href="twinning" class="uri" title="wikilink">twinning</a> of the Trans-Canada Highway between Castle Junction and Sunshine.</p>
<p>The panel issued over 500 recommendations, including limiting the growth of the Banff townsite, capping the town's population at 10,000, placing quotas for popular hiking trails, and curtailing development in the park.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Another recommendation was to fence off the townsite to reduce confrontations between people and elk. By fencing off the townsite, this measure was also intended to reduce access to this refuge for elk from predators, such as wolves that tended to avoid the townsite. Upon release of the report, Copps immediately moved to accept the proposal to cap the town population. She also ordered a small <a href="airstrip" class="uri" title="wikilink">airstrip</a> to be removed, along with a buffalo padlock, and cadet camp, that inhibited wildlife movement.</p>
<p>In response to concerns and recommendations raised by the Banff Bow Valley Study, a number of development plans were curtailed in the 1990s. Plans to add nine holes at the Banff Springs Golf Resort were withdrawn in 1996.</p>
<h3 id="canmore">Canmore</h3>
<p>With the cap on growth in the Town of Banff, <a href="Canmore,_Alberta" title="wikilink">Canmore</a>, located just outside the Banff boundary, has been growing rapidly to serve increasing demands of <a href="tourism" title="wikilink">tourists</a>. Major developments proposals for Canmore have included the Three Sisters Golf Resorts, proposed in 1992, which has been subject of contentious debate, with environmental groups arguing that the development would fragment important <a href="wildlife_corridor" title="wikilink">wildlife corridors</a> in the Bow Valley.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
