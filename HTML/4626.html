<p><strong>African-American history</strong> is the portion of <a href="American_history" title="wikilink">American history</a> that specifically discusses the <a href="African_American" title="wikilink">African American</a> or <a href="Black_people" title="wikilink">Black</a> American ethnic group in the United States. Most African Americans are the descendants of captive Africans held in the United States from 1619 to 1865. Blacks from the Caribbean whose ancestors immigrated, or who immigrated to the U.S., also traditionally have been considered African American, as they share a common history of predominantly <a href="West_Africa" title="wikilink">West African</a> or <a href="Central_Africa" title="wikilink">Central African</a> roots, the <a href="Middle_Passage" title="wikilink">Middle Passage</a> and <a href="slavery" class="uri" title="wikilink">slavery</a>.</p>
<p>It is these peoples, who in the past were referred to and self-identified collectively as the American Negro, who now generally consider themselves African Americans. Their history is celebrated and highlighted annually in the United States during February, designated as <a href="Black_History_Month" title="wikilink">Black History Month</a>, and it is their history that is the focus of this article.</p>
<p>Others who sometimes are referred to as African Americans, and who may self-identify as such in US government censuses, include relatively recent Black immigrants from Africa, South America and elsewhere who self-identify as being of African descent.</p>
<h2 id="african-origins">African origins</h2>
<p>The majority of African Americans descend from slaves, most of whom were sold into slavery as prisoners of war by African states or kidnapped by African, Arab, European or American slave traders. The existing market for slaves in Africa was exploited and expanded by European powers in need of labor for <a href="New_World" title="wikilink">New World</a> <a href="plantations" class="uri" title="wikilink">plantations</a>.</p>
<p>The American slave population was made up of the various ethnic groups from western and central Africa, including the <a href="Bakongo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bakongo</a>, <a href="Igbo_American" title="wikilink">Igbo</a>, <a href="Mand&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mand&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a>, <a href="Wolof_people" title="wikilink">Wolof</a>, <a href="Akan_people" title="wikilink">Akan</a>, <a href="Fon_people" title="wikilink">Fon</a> and <a href="Makua_(people)" title="wikilink">Makua</a> amongst others. Over time in most areas of the Americas, these different peoples did away with tribal differences and forged a new history and culture that was a <a href="creolization" class="uri" title="wikilink">creolization</a> of their common pasts and present.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="introduction-of-slavery">Introduction of slavery</h2>

<p>The first African slaves were brought to <a href="Jamestown,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Jamestown, Virginia</a> in 1619. The English settlers treated these captives as <a href="indentured_servant" title="wikilink">indentured servants</a> and released them after a number of years. This practice was gradually replaced by the system of race-based slavery used in the <a href="Caribbean" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caribbean</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> As servants were freed, they became competition for resources. Additionally, released servants had to be replaced. This, combined with the still ambiguous nature of the social status of Blacks and the difficulty in using any other group of people as forced servants, led to the relegation of Blacks into slavery. <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a> was the first colony to legalize slavery in 1641. Other colonies followed suit by passing laws that passed slavery on to the children of slaves and making non-Christian imported servants slaves for life. <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <img src="Cicatrices_de_flagellation_sur_un_esclave.jpg" title="fig:A former slave displays the telltale criss-cross, keloid scars from being bullwhipped." alt="A former slave displays the telltale criss-cross, keloid scars from being bullwhipped." /></p>
<p>Africans first arrived in 1619, when a Dutch ship sold 19 blacks as indentured servants (not slaves) to Englishmen at <a href="Old_Point_Comfort" title="wikilink">Point Comfort</a> (today's <a href="Fort_Monroe" title="wikilink">Fort Monroe</a>), thirty miles downstream from Jamestown, Virginia. In all, about 10-12 million Africans were transported to Western Hemisphere. The vast majority of these people came from that stretch of the West African coast extending from present-day Senegal to Angola; a small percentage came from Madagascar and East Africa. Only 3% (about 300,000) went to the American colonies. The vast majority went to the West Indies, where they died quickly. Demographic conditions were highly favorable in the American colonies, with less disease, more food, some medical care, and lighter work loads than prevailed in the sugar fields.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>At first the Africans in the South were outnumbered by white indentured servants, who came voluntarily from Britain. They avoided the plantations. With the vast amount of good land and the shortage of laborers, plantation owners turned to lifetime slaves who worked for their keep but were not paid wages and could not easily escape. Slaves had some legal rights (it was a crime to kill a slave, and a few whites were hanged for it.) Generally the slaves developed their own family system, religion and customs in the slave quarters with little interference from owners, who were only interested in work outputs.</p>
<p>By 1700 there were 25,000 slaves in the American colonies, about 10% of the population. A few had come from Africa but most came from the West Indies (especially Trinidad, later Trinidad and Tobago), or, increasingly, were native born. Their legal status was now clear: they were slaves for life and so were the children of slave mothers. They could be sold, or freed, and a few ran away. Slowly a free black population emerged, concentrated in port cities along the Atlantic coast from Charleston to Boston. Slaves in the cities and towns had many more privileges, but the great majority of slaves lived on southern tobacco or rice plantations, usually in groups of 20 or more.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The most serious slave rebellion was the <a href="Stono_Uprising" title="wikilink">Stono Uprising</a>, in September 1739 in South Carolina. The colony had about 56,000 slaves, who outnumbered whites 2:1. About 150 slaves rose up, and seizing guns and ammunition, murdered twenty whites, and headed for Spanish Florida. The local militia soon intercepted and killed most of them.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>All the American colonies had slavery, but it was usually the form of personal servants in the North (where 2% of the people were slaves), and field hands in plantations in the South (where 25% were slaves.)<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-revolution-and-early-america">The Revolution and early America</h2>

<p>The later half of the 18th century was a time of political upheaval in the United States. In the midst of cries for relief from <a href="Kingdom_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">British</a> tyranny and oppression, several people pointed out the apparent hypocrisies of slave holders' demanding freedom. The <a href="United_States_Declaration_of_Independence" title="wikilink">Declaration of Independence</a>, a document that would become a <a href="manifesto" class="uri" title="wikilink">manifesto</a> for human rights and personal freedom, was written by <a href="Thomas_Jefferson" title="wikilink">Thomas Jefferson</a>, who owned over 200 slaves. Other Southern statesmen were also major slaveholders. The <a href="Second_Continental_Congress" title="wikilink">Second Continental Congress</a> did consider freeing slaves to disrupt British commerce. They removed language from the Declaration of Independence that included the promotion of slavery amongst the offenses of <a href="George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">King George III</a>. A number of free Blacks, most notably <a href="Prince_Hall" title="wikilink">Prince Hall</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;the founder of <a href="Prince_Hall_Freemasonry" title="wikilink">Prince Hall Freemasonry</a>, submitted <a href="petitions" class="uri" title="wikilink">petitions</a> for the end of slavery. But these petitions were largely ignored.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>This did not deter Blacks, free and slave, from participating in the Revolution. <a href="Crispus_Attucks" title="wikilink">Crispus Attucks</a>, a free Black tradesman, was the first casualty of the <a href="Boston_Massacre" title="wikilink">Boston Massacre</a> and of the ensuing <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">American Revolutionary War</a>. 5,000 Blacks, including Prince Hall, fought in the <a href="Continental_Army" title="wikilink">Continental Army</a>. Many fought side by side with <a href="White_people" title="wikilink">White</a> soldiers at the <a href="battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord" title="wikilink">battles of Lexington and Concord</a> and at Bunker Hill. But when <a href="George_Washington" title="wikilink">George Washington</a> took command in 1775, he barred any further recruitment of Blacks.</p>
<p>By contrast, the British and <a href="Loyalist_(American_Revolution)" title="wikilink">Loyalists</a> offered <a href="emancipation" class="uri" title="wikilink">emancipation</a> to any slave owned by a <a href="Patriot_(American_Revolution)" title="wikilink">Patriot</a> who was willing to join the Loyalist forces. <a href="John_Murray,_4th_Earl_of_Dunmore" title="wikilink">Lord Dunmore</a>, the <a href="Governor_of_Virginia" title="wikilink">Governor</a> of <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a>, recruited 300 African American men into his <a href="Ethiopian_regiment" title="wikilink">Ethiopian regiment</a> within a month of making this proclamation. In South Carolina 25,000 slaves, more than one-quarter of the total, escaped to join and fight with the British, or fled for freedom in the uproar of war. Thousands of slaves also escaped in Georgia and Virginia, as well as New England and New York. Well-known <a href="Black_Loyalist" title="wikilink">Black Loyalist</a> soldiers include <a href="Colonel_Tye" title="wikilink">Colonel Tye</a> and <a href="Boston_King" title="wikilink">Boston King</a>.</p>
<p>The Americans eventually won the war. In the provisional treaty, they demanded the return of property, including slaves. Nonetheless, the British helped up to 4,000 documented African Americans to leave the country for <a href="Nova_Scotia" title="wikilink">Nova Scotia</a>, <a href="Jamaica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jamaica</a>, and Britain rather than be returned to slavery.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Philadelphia_Convention" title="wikilink">Constitutional Convention</a> of 1787 sought to define the foundation for the government of the newly formed United States of America. The <a href="US_Constitution" title="wikilink">constitution</a> set forth the ideals of freedom and equality while providing for the continuation of the institution of slavery through the <a href="Article_Four_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_3:_Extradition_of_slaves" title="wikilink">fugitive slave clause</a> and the <a href="three-fifths_compromise" title="wikilink">three-fifths compromise</a>. Additionally, free blacks' rights were also restricted in many places. Most were denied the right to vote and were excluded from public schools. Some Blacks sought to fight these contradictions in court. In 1780, <a href="Elizabeth_Freeman_(Mum_Bett)" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Freeman</a> and <a href="Quock_Walker" title="wikilink">Quock Walker</a> used language from the new <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a> constitution that declared all men were born free and equal in <a href="freedom_suits" title="wikilink">freedom suits</a> to gain release from slavery. A free Black businessman in Boston named <a href="Jhalena_Seaton" title="wikilink">Jhalena Seaton</a> sought to be excused from paying taxes since he had no voting rights.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In the Northern states, the revolutionary spirit did help African Americans. Beginning in the 1750s, there was widespread sentiment during thedAmerican Revolution that slavery was a social evil (for the country as a whole and for the whites) that should eventually be abolished. All the Northern states passed emancipation acts between 1780 and 1804; most of these arranged for gradual emancipation and a special status for <a href="freedmen" class="uri" title="wikilink">freedmen</a>, so there were still a dozen &quot;permanent apprentices&quot; into the 19th century. In 1787 Congress passed the <a href="Northwest_Ordinance" title="wikilink">Northwest Ordinance</a> and barred slavery from the large Northwest Territory.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In 1790, there were more than 59,000 free Blacks in the United States. By 1810, that number had risen to 186,446. Most of these were in the North, but Revolutionary sentiments also motivated Southern slaveholders.</p>
<p>For 20 years after the Revolution, more Southerners also freed slaves, sometimes by manumission or in wills to be accomplished after the slaveholder's death. In the Upper South, the percentage of free blacks rose from about 1% before the Revolution to more than 10% by 1810. <a href="Religious_Society_of_Friends" title="wikilink">Quakers</a> and <a href="Moravian_Church" title="wikilink">Moravians</a> worked to persuade slaveholders to free families. In Virginia the number of free blacks increased from 10,000 in 1790 to nearly 30,000 in 1810, but 95% of blacks were still enslaved. In Delaware, three-quarters of all blacks were free by 1810.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> By 1860 just over 91% of Delaware's blacks were free, and 49.1% of those in Maryland.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Among the successful free men was <a href="Benjamin_Banneker" title="wikilink">Benjamin Banneker</a>, a <a href="Maryland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maryland</a> astronomer, mathematician, almanac author, surveyor and farmer, who in 1791 assisted in the initial survey of the boundaries of the future <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">District of Columbia</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Despite the challenges of living in the new country, most free Blacks fared far better than the nearly 800,000 enslaved Blacks. Even so, many considered <a href="emigrating" class="uri" title="wikilink">emigrating</a> to Africa.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-antebellum-period">The Antebellum Period</h2>

<p>As the United States grew, the institution of slavery became more entrenched in the <a href="Southern_United_States" title="wikilink">southern states</a>, while northern states began to abolish it. <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a> was the first, in 1780 passing an act for gradual abolition. A number of events continued to shape views on slavery. The invention of the <a href="cotton_gin" title="wikilink">cotton gin</a> in 1793 allowed the cultivation of short staple cotton, which could be grown in inland areas. This triggered a huge demand for imported slave labor to develop new cotton plantations. There was a 70% increase in the number of slaves in the United States in only 20 years, and they were overwhelmingly concentrated in the <a href="Deep_South" title="wikilink">Deep South</a>.</p>
<p>In 1808, <a href="US_Congress" title="wikilink">Congress</a> abolished the international slave trade. While American Blacks celebrated this as a victory in the fight against slavery, the ban increased the demand for slaves. Changing agricultural practices in the Upper South from tobacco to mixed farming decreased labor requirements, and slaves were sold to traders for the developing Deep South. In addition, the <a href="Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1793" title="wikilink">Fugitive Slave Act of 1793</a> allowed any Black person to be claimed as a runaway unless a White person testified on their behalf. A number of free Blacks, especially <a href="indentured_servants" title="wikilink">indentured</a> children, were <a href="kidnap" title="wikilink">kidnapped</a> and sold into slavery with little or no hope of rescue. By 1819 there were exactly 11 free and 11 slave states, which increased <a href="sectionalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">sectionalism</a>. Fears of an imbalance in Congress led to the 1820 <a href="Missouri_Compromise" title="wikilink">Missouri Compromise</a> that required states to be admitted to the union in pairs, one slave and one free.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Over 1 million slaves were moved from the older seaboard slave states, with their declining economies to the rich cotton states of the southwest; many others were sold and moved locally.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Berlin (2000) argues that this &quot;Second Middle Passage shredded the planters' paternalist pretenses in the eyes of black people and prodded slaves and free people of color to create a host of oppositional ideologies and institutions that better accounted for the realities of endless deportations, expulsions and flights that continually remade their world.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-black-community">The Black community</h3>
<p>The number of free Blacks grew during this time as well. By 1830 there were 319,000 free Blacks in the United States. 150,000 lived in the northern states. While the majority of free blacks lived in poverty, some were able to establish successful businesses that catered to the Black community. <a href="Racial_discrimination" title="wikilink">Racial discrimination</a> often meant that Blacks were not welcome or would be mistreated in White businesses and other establishments. To counter this, Blacks developed their own communities with Black-owned businesses. Black doctors, lawyers and other businessmen were the foundation of the Black <a href="middle_class" title="wikilink">middle class</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><img src="Baptism_in_Buffalo_Bayou.jpg" title="fig:A large group of African-American spectators stands on the banks of Buffalo Bayou to witness a baptism (ca. 1900)." alt="A large group of African-American spectators stands on the banks of Buffalo Bayou to witness a baptism (ca. 1900)." /></p>
<p>Blacks organized to help strengthen the Black community and continue the fight against slavery. One of these organizations was the American Society of Free Persons of Colour, founded in 1830. These organizations provided social aid to poor blacks and organized responses to political issues. The Black community also established schools for Black children, since they were often barred from entering public schools.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Further supporting the growth of the Black Community was the <a href="Black_church" title="wikilink">Black church</a>. Starting in the early 1790s with the <a href="African_Methodist_Episcopal_Church" title="wikilink">African Methodist Episcopal Church</a>, <a href="African_Methodist_Episcopal_Zion_Church" title="wikilink">African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church</a> and other churches, the Black church grew to be the focal point of the Black community. The Black church was both an expression of community and unique African-American spirituality, and a reaction to European American discrimination. At first, Black preachers formed separate congregations within the existing <a href="Christian_denomination" title="wikilink">denominations</a>. Because of discrimination at the higher levels of the church hierarchy, some blacks simply founded separate Black denominations.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Free blacks also established Black churches in the South before 1800. After the <a href="First_Great_Awakening" title="wikilink">Great Awakening</a>, many blacks joined the <a href="Baptist_Church" title="wikilink">Baptist Church</a>, which allowed for their participation, including roles as elders and preachers. For instance, <a href="First_Baptist_Church_(Petersburg,_Virginia)" title="wikilink">First Baptist Church</a> and <a href="Gillfield_Baptist_Church_(Petersburg,_Virginia)" title="wikilink">Gillfield Baptist Church</a> of <a href="Petersburg,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Petersburg, Virginia</a>, both had organized congregations by 1800 and were the first Baptist churches in the city.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Petersburg, an industrial city, by 1860 had 3,224 free blacks, the largest population in the South.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In Virginia, free blacks also created communities in <a href="Richmond,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Richmond, Virginia</a> and other towns, where they could work as artisans and create businesses. Others were able to buy land and farm in frontier areas further from white control.</p>

<h2 id="emancipation-and-reconstruction">Emancipation and Reconstruction</h2>
<p>In 1863, during the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a> (1861&lt;U+2013&gt;1865), President <a href="Abraham_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Abraham Lincoln</a> issued the <a href="Emancipation_Proclamation" title="wikilink">Emancipation Proclamation</a>, freeing slaves in the southern states at war with the North. The <a href="Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">13th amendment</a> of the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1865, outlawed <a href="History_of_slavery_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">slavery</a> in the United States. In 1868, the <a href="Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">14th amendment</a> granted full U.S. citizenship to African-Americans. The <a href="Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">15th amendment</a>, ratified in 1870, extended the right to vote to black males.</p>

<p>After the Union victory over the Confederacy, a brief period of southern black progress, called Reconstruction, followed. From 1865 to 1877, under protection of Union troops, some strides were made toward equal rights for African-Americans. Southern black men began to vote and were elected to the <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">United States Congress</a> and to local offices such as sheriff. Coalitions of white and black Republicans passed bills to establish the first public school systems in most states of the South, although sufficient funding was hard to find. Blacks established their own churches, towns and businesses. Tens of thousands migrated to Mississippi for the chance to clear and own their own land, as 90% of the bottomlands were undeveloped. By the end of the century, two-thirds of the farmers who owned land in the Mississippi Delta bottomlands were black.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The aftermath of the Civil War accelerated the process of national African-American <a href="identity_formation" title="wikilink">identity formation</a>. Tens of thousands of Black northerners left homes and careers and also migrated to the defeated South, building schools, printing newspapers, and opening businesses. As Joel Williamson puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of the migrants, women as well as men, came as teachers sponsored by a dozen or so benevolent societies, arriving in the still turbulent wake of Union armies. Others came to organize relief for the refugees.... Still others... came south as religious missionaries... Some came south as business or professional people seeking opportunity on this... special black frontier. Finally, thousands came as soldiers, and when the war was over, many of [their] young men remained there or returned after a stay of some months in the North to complete their education.</p>

They mandated de jure segregation in all public facilities, with a supposedly &quot;separate but equal&quot; status for black Americans. In reality, this led to treatment and accommodations that were usually inferior to those provided for white Americans, systematizing a number of economic, educational and social disadvantages.</p>
<p>In the face of years of mounting violence and intimidation directed at blacks as well as whites sympathetic to their cause, the U.S. government retreated from its pledge to guarantee constitutional protections to freedmen and women. When <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="Rutherford_B._Hayes" title="wikilink">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> withdrew Union troops from the South in 1877 as a result of a national compromise on the election, white Democratic southerners acted quickly to reverse the groundbreaking advances of Reconstruction. To reduce black voting and regain control of state legislatures, Democrats had used a combination of violence, fraud, and intimidation since the election of 1868. These techniques were prominent among paramilitary groups such as the <a href="White_League" title="wikilink">White League</a> and <a href="Red_Shirts_(Southern_United_States)" title="wikilink">Red Shirts</a> in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida prior to the 1876 elections. In South Carolina, for instance, one historian estimated that 150 blacks were killed in the weeks before the election.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Massacres occurred at <a href="Hamburg_Massacre" title="wikilink">Hamburg</a> and Ellenton.</p>
<p><a href="White_people" title="wikilink">White</a> paramilitary violence against African Americans intensified. Many blacks were fearful of this trend, and men like <a href="Benjamin_&quot;Pap&quot;_Singleton" title="wikilink">Benjamin &quot;Pap&quot; Singleton</a> began speaking of separating from the South. This idea culminated in the 1879-1880 movement of the <a href="Exodusters" class="uri" title="wikilink">Exodusters</a>, who migrated to Kansas.</p>

<p>White Democrats first passed laws to make voter registration and elections more complicated. Most of the rules acted overwhelmingly against blacks, but many poor whites were also disfranchised. Interracial coalitions of Populists and Republicans in some states succeeded in controlling legislatures in the 1880s and 1894, which made the Democrats more determined to reduce voting by poorer classes. When Democrats took control of Tennessee in 1888, they passed laws making voter registration more complicated and ended the most competitive political state in the South. Voting by blacks in rural areas and small towns dropped sharply, as did voting by poor whites.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>From 1890 to 1908, starting with Mississippi and ending with Georgia, ten of eleven Southern states adopted new constitutions or amendments that effectively <a href="disfranchisement_after_Reconstruction_era_(United_States)" title="wikilink">disfranchised</a> most blacks and many poor whites. Using a combination of provisions such as <a href="poll_taxes" title="wikilink">poll taxes</a>, residency requirements and <a href="literacy_tests" title="wikilink">literacy tests</a>, states dramatically decreased black voter registration and turnout, in some cases to zero.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The <a href="grandfather_clause" title="wikilink">grandfather clause</a> was used in many states temporarily to exempt illiterate white voters from literacy tests. As power became concentrated under the Democratic Party in the South, the party positioned itself as a private club and instituted <a href="white_primaries" title="wikilink">white primaries</a>, closing blacks out of the only competitive contests. By 1910 one-party white rule was firmly established across the South.</p>
<p>Although African Americans quickly started litigation to challenge such provisions, early court decisions at the state and national level went against them. In <em><a href="Williams_v._Mississippi" title="wikilink">Williams v. Mississippi</a></em> (1898), the US <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Supreme Court</a> upheld state provisions. This encouraged other Southern states to adopt similar measures over the next few years, as noted above. <a href="Booker_T._Washington" title="wikilink">Booker T. Washington</a>, of <a href="Tuskegee_Institute" title="wikilink">Tuskegee Institute</a> secretly worked with Northern supporters to raise funds and provide representation for African Americans in additional cases, such as <em><a href="Giles_v._Harris" title="wikilink">Giles v. Harris</a></em> (1903) and <em><a href="Giles_v._Teasley" title="wikilink">Giles v. Teasley</a></em> (1904), but again the Supreme Court upheld the states.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Seeking to return blacks to their subordinate status under slavery, <a href="white_supremacists" title="wikilink">white supremacists</a> resurrected <em>de facto</em> barriers and enacted new laws to segregate society along racial lines. They limited black access to transportation, schools, restaurants and other public facilities. White supremacists also promoted the idea that blacks' participation in government in the South was ended due to incompetence; this view was disseminated in school textbooks and movies such as <em><a href="The_Birth_of_a_Nation" title="wikilink">The Birth of a Nation</a></em> in 1915. Although slavery had been abolished, most southern blacks for decades continued to struggle in grinding poverty as agricultural, domestic and menial laborers. Many became <a href="sharecropper" title="wikilink">sharecroppers</a>, their economic status little changed by emancipation.</p>
<h3 id="racial-terrorism">Racial terrorism</h3>
<p>After its founding in 1867, the <a href="Ku_Klux_Klan" title="wikilink">Ku Klux Klan</a>, a secret <a href="vigilante" class="uri" title="wikilink">vigilante</a> organization sworn to perpetuate white supremacy, became a power for a few years in the South and beyond, eventually establishing a northern headquarters in <a href="Greenfield,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Greenfield, Indiana</a>. Its members hid behind masks and robes to hide their identity while they carried out violence and property damage. The Klan employed <a href="lynching" class="uri" title="wikilink">lynching</a>, <a href="cross_burning" title="wikilink">cross burnings</a> and other forms of <a href="terrorism" class="uri" title="wikilink">terrorism</a>, physical violence, house burnings, and intimidation. The Klan's excesses led to the passage of legislation against it, and with Federal enforcement, it was squeezed out by 1871.</p>
<p>The anti-Republican and anti-freedmen sentiment only briefly went underground, as violence arose in other incidents, especially after Louisiana's disputed state election in 1872, which contributed to the <a href="Colfax_massacre" title="wikilink">Colfax</a> and <a href="Coushatta_massacre" title="wikilink">Coushatta massacres</a> in <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a> in 1873 and 1874. Tensions and rumors were high in many parts of the South. when violence erupted, African Americans consistently were killed at a much higher rate than were European Americans. Historians of the 20th century have renamed events long called &quot;riots&quot; in southern history. The common stories featured whites' heroically saving the community from marauding blacks. Upon examination of the evidence, historians have called numerous such events &quot;massacres&quot;, as at Colfax, because of the disproportionate number of fatalities for blacks as opposed to whites. The mob violence there resulted in 40-50 blacks dead for each of the three whites killed.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>While not as widely known as the Klan, the <a href="paramilitary_organizations" title="wikilink">paramilitary organizations</a> that arose in the South during the mid-1870s as the white Democrats mounted a stronger insurgency, were more directed and effective than the Klan in challenging Republican governments, suppressing the black vote and achieving political goals. Unlike the Klan, paramilitary members operated openly, often solicited newspaper coverage, and had distinct political goals: to turn Republicans out of office and suppress or dissuade black voting in order to regain power in 1876. Groups included the <a href="White_League" title="wikilink">White League</a>, that started from white militias in Grant Parish, Louisiana, in 1874 and spread in the <a href="Deep_South" title="wikilink">Deep South</a>; the <a href="Red_Shirts_(Southern_United_States)" title="wikilink">Red Shirts</a>, that started in <a href="Mississippi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mississippi</a> in 1875 but had chapters arise and was prominent in the 1876 election campaign in <a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a>, as well as in <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a>; and other White Line organizations such as rifle clubs.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Jim_Crow_laws" title="wikilink">Jim Crow</a> era accompanied the most cruel wave of &quot;racial&quot; suppression that America has yet experienced. Between 1890 and 1940, millions of African Americans were disfranchised, killed, and brutalized. According to newspaper records kept at the <a href="Tuskegee_University" title="wikilink">Tuskegee Institute</a>, about 5,000 men, women, and children were murdered outright, tortured to death in documented extrajudicial public rituals of mob violence —human sacrifices called &quot;<a href="lynchings" class="uri" title="wikilink">lynchings</a>.&quot; The journalist <a href="Ida_B._Wells" title="wikilink">Ida B. Wells</a> estimated that lynchings not reported by the newspapers, plus similar executions under the veneer of &quot;due process&quot;, may have amounted to about 20,000 killings.</p>
<p>Of the tens of thousands of lynchers and onlookers during this period, it is reported that fewer than 50 whites were ever indicted for their crimes, and only four sentenced. Because blacks were disfranchised, they could not sit on juries or have any part in the political process, including local offices. Meanwhile, the lynchings were a weapon of white mob terror with millions of Afro-Americans living in a constant state of anxiety and fear.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Most blacks were denied their right to keep and bear arms under Jim Crow laws, and they were therefore unable to protect themselves or their families.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="civil-rights">Civil rights</h2>
<p>In response to these and other setbacks, in the summer of 1905, <a href="W._E._B._Du_Bois" title="wikilink">W. E. B. Du Bois</a> and 28 other prominent, African-American men met secretly at <a href="Niagara_Falls,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Niagara Falls, Ontario</a>. There, they produced a manifesto calling for an end to racial discrimination, full civil liberties for African Americans and recognition of human brotherhood. The organization they established came to be called the <a href="Niagara_Movement" title="wikilink">Niagara Movement</a>. After the notorious <a href="Springfield,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Springfield, Illinois</a> race riot of 1908, a group of concerned <a href="White_people" title="wikilink">Whitesjoined</a> with the leadership of the Niagara Movement and formed the <a href="National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People" title="wikilink">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP) a year later, in 1909. Under the leadership of Du Bois, the NAACP mounted legal challenges to segregation and lobbied legislatures on behalf of black Americans. During this period, African Americans continued to create independent community and institutional lives for themselves. They established schools, <a href="Church_(building)" title="wikilink">churches</a>, social welfare institutions, banks, newspapers and small businesses to serve the needs of their communities.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-migration-and-the-harlem-renaissance">The Great Migration and the Harlem Renaissance</h2>

<p>During the first half of the 20th century, the largest internal population shift in U.S. history took place. Starting about 1910, through the <a href="Great_Migration_(African_American)" title="wikilink">Great Migration</a> over five million African Americans made choices and &quot;voted with their feet&quot; by moving from the South to northern cities, the West and Midwest in hopes of escaping political discrimination and hatred, violence, finding better jobs, voting and enjoying greater equality and education for their children. In the 1920s, the concentration of blacks in New York led to the cultural movement known as the <a href="Harlem_Renaissance" title="wikilink">Harlem Renaissance</a>, whose influence reached nationwide. Black intellectual and cultural circles were influenced by thinkers such as <a href="Aim&lt;U+00E9&gt;_C&lt;U+00E9&gt;saire" title="wikilink">Aim&lt;U+00E9&gt; C&lt;U+00E9&gt;saire</a> and <a href="L&lt;U+00E9&gt;opold_S&lt;U+00E9&gt;dar_Senghor" title="wikilink">L&lt;U+00E9&gt;opold S&lt;U+00E9&gt;dar Senghor</a>, who celebrated blackness, or <a href="n&lt;U+00E9&gt;gritude" class="uri" title="wikilink">n&lt;U+00E9&gt;gritude</a>; and arts and letters flourished.

<p>The <a href="South_Side_(Chicago)" title="wikilink">South Side of Chicago</a>, a destination for many on the trains up from Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana, became the black capital of America, generating flourishing businesses, music, arts and foods. A new generation of powerful African American political leaders and organizations also came to the fore. Membership in the NAACP rapidly increased as it mounted an anti-lynching campaign in reaction to ongoing southern white violence against blacks. <a href="Marcus_Garvey" title="wikilink">Marcus Garvey</a>'s <a href="Universal_Negro_Improvement_Association_and_African_Communities_League" title="wikilink">Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League</a>, the <a href="Nation_of_Islam" title="wikilink">Nation of Islam</a>, and union organizer <a href="A._Philip_Randolph" title="wikilink">A.

Still, many African Americans eagerly volunteered to join the <a href="Allies_of_World_War_I" title="wikilink">Allied</a> cause following America's entry into the war. More than two million African American men rushed to register for the draft. By the time of the <a href="Armistice_with_Germany_(Compi&lt;U+00E8&gt;gne)" title="wikilink">armistice with Germany</a> in November 1918, over 350,000 African Americans had served with the American Expeditionary Force in on the Western Front.</p>
<p>Most African American units were relegated to support roles and did not see combat. Still, African Americans played a minor role in America's war effort.</p>
<p>Four African American regiments were integrated into French units because the French suffered heavy losses and badly needed men after three years of a terrible war.</p>
<p>One of the most distinguished units was the <a href="369th_Infantry_Regiment" title="wikilink">369th Infantry Regiment</a>, known as the &quot;Harlem Hellfighters&quot;, which was on the front lines for six months, longer than any other American unit in the war. 171 members of the 369th were awarded the <a href="Legion_of_Merit" title="wikilink">Legion of Merit</a>.</p>
<p><img src="Red_Hand_Division.jpg" title="fig:157th I.D.Red Hand flag 1 drawn by General Mariano Goybet" alt="157th I.D.Red Hand flag 1 drawn by General Mariano Goybet" /> The 371st and 372nd African American Regiments were integrated under the 157th Red Hand Division<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> commanded by the French General <a href="Mariano_Goybet" title="wikilink">Mariano Goybet</a>.

<p>Corporal <a href="Freddie_Stowers" title="wikilink">Freddie Stowers</a> of the <a href="371st_Infantry_Regiment_(United_States)" title="wikilink">371st Infantry Regiment</a> was posthumously awarded a <a href="Medal_of_honor" title="wikilink">Medal of honor</a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a>&lt;U+2014&gt;the only African American to be so honored for actions in World War I. During action in <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, Stowers had led an assault on German trenches, continuing to lead and encourage his men even after being wounded twice. Stowers died from his wounds, but his men continued the fight on a German machine gun nest near Bussy farm in Champagne, and eventually defeated the <a href="Reichswehr" title="wikilink">German troops</a>.</p>
<p>Stowers was recommended for the Medal of Honor shortly after his death, but according to the Army, the nomination was misplaced. Many believed the recommendation had been intentionally ignored due to institutional racism in the Armed Forces. In 1990, under pressure from <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">Congress</a>, the <a href="United_States_Department_of_Defense" title="wikilink">Defense Department</a> launched an investigation. Based on findings from this investigation, the Army Decorations Board approved the award of the Medal of Honor to Stowers. On April 24, 1991&lt;U+2013&gt;73 years after he was killed in action&lt;U+2014&gt;Stowers' two surviving sisters received the Medal of Honor from President <a href="George_H.W._Bush" title="wikilink">George H.W.

<h2 id="world-war-ii">World War II</h2>

<p><img src="Blacksoldiersfrance.jpg" title="fig:Black soldiers in France, 1944" alt="Black soldiers in France, 1944" /> Many soldiers of color served their country with distinction during World War II.</p>
<p>Famous segregated units, such as the <a href="Tuskegee_Airmen" title="wikilink">Tuskegee Airmen</a> and the <a href="U.S._761st_Tank_Battalion" title="wikilink">U.S. 761st Tank Battalion</a> proved their value in combat. Approximately 75 percent of the soldiers who served in the European theater as truckers for the <a href="Red_Ball_Express" title="wikilink">Red Ball Express</a> and kept Allied supply lines open were African American.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> A total of 708 African Americans were killed in combat during World War II.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="second-great-migration">Second Great Migration</h2>

<p>The Second Great Migration was the <a href="Human_migration" title="wikilink">migration</a> of more than 5 million African Americans from <a href="Southern_United_States" title="wikilink">the South</a> to the other three regions of the United States. It took place place from 1941, through <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, and lasted until 1970.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> It was much larger and of a different character than the first <a href="Great_Migration_(African_American)" title="wikilink">Great Migration</a> (1910&lt;U+2013&gt;1940). Some historians prefer to distinguish between the movements for those reasons.</p>
<p>In the Second Great Migration, more than five million African Americans moved to cities in states in the North, <a href="Midwest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Midwest</a> and West, including many to <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>, where <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> and Oakland offered many skilled jobs in the defense industry. More of these migrants were already urban laborers who came from the cities of the South. They were better educated and had better skills than people who did not migrate.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Compared to the more rural migrants of the period 1910-1940, many African Americans in the South were already living in urban areas and had urban job skills before they relocated. They moved to take jobs in the burgeoning industrial cities and especially the many jobs in the defense industry during World War II (WWII). Workers who were limited to segregated, low-skilled jobs in Southern cities were able to get highly skilled, well-paid jobs at California shipyards.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>By the end of the Second Great Migration, African Americans had become an urbanized population. More than 80 percent lived in cities. Fifty-three percent remained in the Southern United States, while 40 percent lived in the Northeast and North Central states and 7 percent in the West.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-civil-rights-movement">The Civil Rights Movement</h2>

<p>The <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Supreme Court</a> handed down a landmark decision in the case of <em><a href="Brown_v._Board_of_Education" title="wikilink">Brown v. Board of Education</a></em> (1954) of <a href="Topeka,_Kansas" title="wikilink">Topeka</a>. This decision led to the dismantling of legal segregation in all areas of southern life, from schools to restaurants to public restrooms, but it occurred slowly and only after concerted activism by African Americans. <a href="Fannie_E._Motley" title="wikilink">Fannie E. Motley</a> graduated from Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama in 1956. The ruling also brought new momentum to the <a href="American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955-1968)" title="wikilink">Civil Rights Movement</a>. <a href="Boycott" title="wikilink">Boycotts</a> against segregated public transportation systems sprang up in the South, the most notable of which was the <a href="Montgomery_Bus_Boycott" title="wikilink">Montgomery Bus Boycott</a>.</p>
<p>Civil rights groups such as the <a href="Southern_Christian_Leadership_Conference" title="wikilink">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a> (SCLC) organized across the South with tactics such as boycotts, voter registration campaigns, <a href="Freedom_Rides" title="wikilink">Freedom Rides</a> and other nonviolent direct action, such as marches, pickets and sit-ins to mobilize around issues of equal access and voting rights. Southern segregationists fought back to block reform. The conflict grew to involve steadily escalating physical violence, bombings and intimidation by Southern whites. Law enforcement responded to protesters with batons, electric cattle prods, fire hoses, attack dogs and mass arrests.</p>
<p>In <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a>, state legislators, school board members and other public officials mounted a campaign of obstructionism and outright defiance to integration called <a href="Massive_Resistance" title="wikilink">Massive Resistance</a>. It entailed a series of actions to deny state funding to integrated schools and instead fund privately run &quot;segregation academies&quot; for white students. <a href="Farmville,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Farmville, Virginia</a>, in <a href="Prince_Edward_County,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Prince Edward County</a>, was one of the plaintiff African-American communities involved in the 1954 <em>Brown v.

As a last-ditch effort to avoid court-ordered desegregation, officials in the county shut down the county's entire public school system in 1959 and it remained closed for five years.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> White students were able to attend private schools established by the community for the sole purpose of circumventing integration. The largely black rural population of the county had little recourse. Some families were split up as parents sent their children to live with relatives in other locales to attend public school; but the majority of Prince Edward's more than 2,000 black children, as well as many poor whites, simply remained unschooled until federal court action forced the schools to reopen five years later.</p>

<p>The &quot;Mississippi Freedom Summer&quot; of 1964 brought thousands of idealistic youth, black and white, to the state to run &quot;freedom schools&quot;, to teach basic literacy, history and civics. Other volunteers were involved in voter registration drives. The season was marked by harassment, intimidation and violence directed at civil rights workers and their host families. The disappearance of three youths, <a href="James_Chaney" title="wikilink">James Chaney</a>, <a href="Andrew_Goodman" title="wikilink">Andrew Goodman</a> and <a href="Michael_Schwerner" title="wikilink">Michael Schwerner</a> in <a href="Philadelphia,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Philadelphia, Mississippi</a>, captured the attention of the nation. Six weeks later, searchers found the savagely beaten body of Chaney, a black man, in a muddy dam alongside the remains of his two white companions, who had been shot to death. Outrage at the escalating injustices of the &quot;Mississippi Blood Summer&quot;,as it by then had come to be known, and at the brutality of the murders, brought about the passage of the <a href="Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965" title="wikilink">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a>. The Act struck down barriers to black enfranchisement and was the capstone to more than a decade of major civil rights legislation.</p>
<p>By this time, African Americans who questioned the effectiveness of nonviolent protest had gained a greater voice. More militant black leaders, such as <a href="Malcolm_X" title="wikilink">Malcolm X</a> of the <a href="Nation_of_Islam" title="wikilink">Nation of Islam</a> and <a href="Eldridge_Cleaver" title="wikilink">Eldridge Cleaver</a> of the <a href="Black_Panther_Party" title="wikilink">Black Panther Party</a>, called for blacks to defend themselves, using violence, if necessary. From the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, the <a href="Black_Power" title="wikilink">Black Power</a> movement urged African Americans to look to Africa for inspiration and emphasized black solidarity, rather than integration.</p>

<p><img src="Official_portrait_of_Barack_Obama.jpg" title="fig:The first African-American President of the United States, Barack Obama" alt="The first African-American President of the United States, Barack Obama" /> Politically and economically, blacks have made substantial strides in the post-civil rights era. Civil rights leader <a href="Jesse_Jackson" title="wikilink">Jesse Jackson</a>, who ran for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988, brought unprecedented support and leverage to blacks in politics.</p>
<p>In 1989, <a href="Douglas_Wilder" title="wikilink">Douglas Wilder</a> became the first African-American elected governor in U.S. history. In 1992 <a href="Carol_Moseley-Braun" title="wikilink">Carol Moseley-Braun</a> of <a href="Illinois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Illinois</a> became the first black woman elected to the <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">U.S. Senate</a>.

<p>Economic progress for blacks' reaching the extremes of wealth has been slow. According to Forbes richest lists, <a href="Oprah_Winfrey" title="wikilink">Oprah Winfrey</a> was the richest African American of the 20th century and has been the world's only <a href="black_billionaires" title="wikilink">black billionaire</a> in 2004, 2005, and 2006. <a href="http://www.aframnews.com/html/2006-05-10/publisher.htm">3</a> Not only was Winfrey the world's only black billionaire but she has been the only black on the <a href="Forbes_400" title="wikilink">Forbes 400</a> list nearly every year since 1995. <a href="Black_Entertainment_Television" title="wikilink">BET</a> founder <a href="Robert_L._Johnson" title="wikilink">Bob Johnson</a> briefly joined her on the list from 2001-2003 before his ex-wife acquired part of his fortune; although he returned to the list in 2006, he did not make it in 2007. With Winfrey the only African American wealthy enough to rank among America's 400 richest people <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070920/apfn_forbes_400_alphabetical_list.html">4</a>, blacks currently comprise 0.25% of America's economic elite and comprise 13% of the U.S. population.</p>
<p>In 2008, Illinois senator <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a> became the first black presidential nominee of the <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic Party</a>, making him the first <a href="African-American" class="uri" title="wikilink">African-American</a> presidential candidate from a major political party.

<h2 id="historiography">Historiography</h2>
<p>The history of slavery has always been a major research topic for white scholars, but until the 1950s they generally focused on the political and constitutional themes as debated by white politicians; they did not study the lives of the black slaves. During <a href="Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Reconstruction</a> and the late 19th century, blacks became major actors in the South. The <a href="Dunning_School" title="wikilink">Dunning School</a> of white scholars generally cast the blacks as pawns of white Carpetbaggers during this period, but <a href="W._E._B._Du_Bois" title="wikilink">W. E. B. Du Bois</a>, a black historian, and <a href="Ulrich_B._Phillips" title="wikilink">Ulrich B. Phillips</a>, a white historian, studied the African-American experience in depth. Du Bois' study of Reconstruction provided a more objective context for evaluating its achievements and weaknesses; in addition, he did studies of contemporary black life. Phillips set the main topics of inquiry that still guide the analysis of slave economics.</p>
<p>During the first half of the 20th century, <a href="Carter_G._Woodson" title="wikilink">Carter G. Woodson</a> was the major black scholar studying and promoting the black historical experience. Woodson insisted that the study of African descendants be scholarly sound, creative, restorative, and, most important, directly relevant to the black community. He popularized black history with a variety of innovative strategies, including Association for the Study of Negro Life outreach activities, Negro History Month (now <a href="Black_History_Month" title="wikilink">Black History Month</a>, in February), and a popular black history magazine. Woodson democratized, legitimized, and popularized black history.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Benjamin_Quarles" title="wikilink">Benjamin Quarles</a> (1904&lt;U+2013&gt;96) had a significant impact on the teaching of African-American history. Quarles and <a href="John_Hope_Franklin" title="wikilink">John Hope Franklin</a> provided a bridge between the work of historians in <a href="historically_black_colleges" title="wikilink">historically black colleges</a>, such as Woodson, and the black history that is now well established in mainline universities. Quarles grew up in Boston, attended <a href="Shaw_University" title="wikilink">Shaw University</a> as an undergraduate, and received a graduate degree at the <a href="University_of_Wisconsin" title="wikilink">University of Wisconsin</a>. He began in 1953 teaching at <a href="Morgan_State_College" title="wikilink">Morgan State College</a> in Baltimore, where he stayed, despite a lucrative offer from <a href="Johns_Hopkins_University" title="wikilink">Johns Hopkins University</a>. Quarles' books included <em>The Negro in the American Revolution</em> (1961), <em>Black Abolitionists</em> (1969), <em>The Negro in the Civil War</em> (1953), and <em>Lincoln and the Negro</em> (1962), which were narrative accounts of critical wartime episodes that focused on how blacks interacted with their white allies.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Black history attempted to reverse centuries of ignorance. While black historians were not alone in advocating a new examination of slavery and racism in the United States, the study of African-American history has often been a political and scholarly struggle to change assumptions. One of the foremost assumptions was that slaves were passive and did not rebel. A series of historians transformed the image of African Americans, revealing a much richer and complex experience. Historians such as <a href="Leon_F._Litwack" title="wikilink">Leon F. Litwack</a> showed how former slaves fought to keep their families together and struggled against tremendous odds to define themselves as free people. Others wrote of rebellions small and large.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, black history is regarded as mainstream. Since proclamation by President <a href="Jimmy_Carter" title="wikilink">Jimmy Carter</a>, it is celebrated every February in the United States during &quot;Black History Month.&quot; Proponents of black history believe that it promotes diversity, develops self-esteem, and corrects myths and stereotypes. Opponents argue such curricula are dishonest, divisive, and lack academic credibility and rigor.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="knowledge-of-black-history">Knowledge of black history</h3>
<p>Surveys of 11th and 12th-grade students and adults in 2005 show that American schools have made them very well informed about black history. Both groups were asked to name ten famous Americans, excluding presidents. Of the students, the three highest names were blacks: 67% named Martin Luther King, 60% Rosa Parks, and 44% Harriet Tubman. Among adults, King was 2nd (at 36%) and Parks was tied for 4th with 30%, while Tubman tied for 10th place with Henry Ford, at 16%. When distinguished historians were asked in 2006 to name the most prominent Americans, Parks and Tubman did not make the top 100.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
