<p><strong>Severe Tropical Cyclone Susan</strong> was one of <a href="List_of_the_most_intense_tropical_cyclones#South_Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">the most intense tropical cyclones</a> on record within the <a href="Tropical_cyclone_basins#South_Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">South Pacific basin</a>, which was first noted on December 20, 1997, as a weak <a href="tropical_disturbance" title="wikilink">tropical disturbance</a> located to the north of <a href="American_Samoa" title="wikilink">American Samoa</a>. Over the next 12 days, the disturbance remained weak while it gradually moved towards the southwest before it started to rapidly develop on January 2, 1998 while it was located near the <a href="Fiji" title="wikilink">Fijian</a> dependency of <a href="Rotuma" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rotuma</a>. The disturbance was declared a <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclone</a> later that day, but was not <a href="Tropical_cyclone_naming" title="wikilink">named</a> Susan until the next day, after it had intensified into a category 2 tropical cyclone on the <a href="Tropical_cyclone_scales#Australia_and_Fiji" title="wikilink">Australian Scale</a>. Over the next few days, Susan moved towards the southwest and continued to intensify before it reached its peak intensities as a <a href="Tropical_cyclone_scales" title="wikilink">category five tropical cyclone</a> during January 5 while it was located about  to the northwest of <a href="Vanuatu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vanuatu</a>'s <a href="capital_city" title="wikilink">capital city</a> <a href="Port_Vila" title="wikilink">Port Vila</a>.</p>
<p>At this stage as the cyclone was moving towards the southwest it posed a severe threat to Vanuatu however, during that day Susan recurved towards the southeast and subsequently spared Vanuatu a direct hit. After sparing Vanuatu a direct hit, Susan started to accelerate towards the southeast and while starting to weaken significantly passed close enough to Fiji during January 7 and 8 to cause <a href="Beaufort_scale" title="wikilink">gale force winds</a> in Fiji's southern and western islands. While continuing to move towards the southeast, Susan started to interact with <a href="Cyclone_Ron" title="wikilink">Severe Tropical Cyclone Ron</a> during January 8 before it absorbed Ron by 0600 UTC the next day and starting to transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants of the combined systems were then monitored for another day until they were last noted on January 10, bringing an unseasonable cold snap to <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a>. Despite sparing Vanuatu and Fiji direct hits, heavy rain and gale force winds associated with Susan were reported to have caused minor damage to several Vanuatuan and Fijian islands. These islands included <a href="Viti_Levu" title="wikilink">Viti Levu</a> where a possible <a href="tornado" class="uri" title="wikilink">tornado</a> destroyed the roof of a shopping centre and the Vanuatuan island of <a href="Aoba_Island" title="wikilink">Ambrym</a>, where a woman died after being hit by a falling coconut tree, while gathering supplies to secure her house with.</p>

<p>According to RSMC Nadi, Susan had peak 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 230 km/h (145 mph) which made it a category five severe tropical cyclone on the <a href="Tropical_cyclone_scales#Australia_and_Fiji" title="wikilink">Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> RSMC Nadi also estimated that Susan had an estimated minimum pressure of 900 hPa (26.58 inHg), which made it one of the two most intense tropical cyclones on record in the Southern Pacific.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> This record was subsequently broken in 2002, when <a href="Cyclone_Zoe" title="wikilink">Severe Tropical Cyclone Zoe</a> had an estimated minimum pressure of 890 hPa (26.28 inHg) and became the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the southern Pacific and Australian basins.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>On January 5, the Vanuatu National Disaster Management Council issued various tropical cyclone alerts for various islands to warn residents about the approaching cyclone, which included a red alert for the <a href="Maewo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maewo</a>, <a href="Pentecost_Island" title="wikilink">Pentecost</a> and <a href="Aoba_Island" title="wikilink">Ambae</a> islands.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Because of the upcoming cyclone Vanuatu's national radio extended its programming to run throughout the night of January 5&lt;U+2013&gt;6, while Vanuatu's domestic airline <a href="Vanair" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vanair</a> closed its airfields in the northern islands and cancelled all of its flights except for several direct flights between <a href="Santo_Island" title="wikilink">Santo Island</a> and <a href="Port_Vila" title="wikilink">Port Vila</a> the capital city of Vanuatu.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> All ships and small boats were advised to seek refuge due to the high seas and swells that were expected from Susan.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> However during the afternoon of January 7, Susan recurved towards the southeast and the Fijian islands &quot;just in time to spare Vanuatu, a direct hit.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Despite being spared a direct hit, heavy rain and gale force winds were reported to have caused minor damage to several <a href="Vanuatuan_Islands" title="wikilink">Vanuatuan Islands</a>, including on <a href="Aoba_Island" title="wikilink">Ambrym Island</a>, where a woman died after being hit by a falling coconut tree, while gathering supplies to secure her house with.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> After the alerts were cancelled on January 7, by the National Disaster Management Council, most shops and government buildings on Efate island kept their shutters up because <a href="Cyclone_Katrina" title="wikilink">Cyclone Katrina</a> was predicted to affect the archipelago within a few days.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
