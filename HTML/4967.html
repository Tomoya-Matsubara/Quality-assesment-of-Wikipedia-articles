<p><strong>Marc Coleman</strong> was <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Economics Editor of <a href="Newstalk_106_to_108" title="wikilink">Newstalk 106 to 108</a> and a commentator for the <em><a href="Sunday_Independent_(Ireland)" title="wikilink">Sunday Independent</a></em> newspaper. He has been criticised for his opposition to workers being unionised, and for his inaccurate claims regarding the <a href="Dublin_Lock-out" title="wikilink">Dublin Lock-out</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Coleman was born in Dublin but lived as a child in Erlangen, Bavaria before returning to Ireland in the mid-1970s. He was a member of <a href="Fine_Gael" title="wikilink">Fine Gael</a> in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
<p>A graduate of the <a href="Kiel_Institute_for_the_World_Economy" title="wikilink">Kiel Institute for the World Economy</a>, Coleman also holds both a scholarship MBA and Master's degree from University College Dublin and a primary degree from <a href="Trinity_College,_Dublin" title="wikilink">Trinity College, Dublin</a>.</p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<p>Coleman became Newstalk's Economics Editor in 2007 after working for <em><a href="The_Irish_Times" title="wikilink">The Irish Times</a></em> between 2005 and 2007.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He now also writes for Ireland's largest Sunday paper, the <em><a href="Sunday_Independent_(Ireland)" title="wikilink">Sunday Independent</a></em>, broadcasts a weekly current affairs programme &quot;Coleman at Large&quot; on Newstalk 106-108fm and regularly speaks at public events.</p>
<p>Coleman's publications prior to joining <em>The Irish Times</em> included articles in the ESRI Quarterly Economic Commentary, the Jesuit publication <em>Studies</em>, <em>Administration</em> magazine and <em><a href="Magill" class="uri" title="wikilink">Magill</a></em> magazine.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-is-yet-to-come"><em>The Best is Yet to Come</em></h2>
<p>In 2007 he published <em>The Best is Yet to Come</em>. The book forecast the continued growth in the Irish economy as well as a sustainable construction Industry for the years ahead. As of 2011, Ireland was in deep recession with the virtual collapse of the construction Industry, rising unemployment and zero growth rate throughout the economy. On his late night talk show, &quot;Coleman at Large&quot;, he has repeatedly stated that his predictions are still valid and that he is looking forward to 2020. He has not expanded on this opinion. Late in 2009, Coleman published &quot;Back from the Brink&quot; in which Coleman prescribed policies that he argued would accelerate economic recovery in Ireland and the world, largely identical with the policies he had advocated before the economic collapse. One of these policies included multi-generational mortgages as a way to spread Ireland's debt burden over time.</p>
<h2 id="style">Style</h2>
<p>Common topics for discussion on his radio shows on <a href="Newstalk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newstalk</a> are: religion in Ireland, the liberal bias of the media and the lack of a conservative party in Ireland. He has stated that as a statistician he does not trust the majority of polls that claim to represent public opinion.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
