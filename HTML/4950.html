<p><strong>Myrtle Claire Bachelder</strong> (March 13, 1908 – May 22, 1997) was an American chemist and <a href="Women&#39;s_Army_Corps" title="wikilink">Women's Army Corps</a> officer, who is noted for her secret work on the <a href="Manhattan_Project" title="wikilink">Manhattan Project</a> atomic bomb program, and for the development of techniques in the chemistry of metals.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-and-career">Early life and career</h2>
<p>Myrtle C. Bachelder was born on March 13, 1908 in <a href="Orange,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Orange, Massachusetts</a>. She earned a bachelor of science degree from <a href="Middlebury_College" title="wikilink">Middlebury College</a> in 1930. She then was a high school science teacher and athletics coach in <a href="South_Hadley,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">South Hadley Falls, Massachusetts</a>, where she taught physics, chemistry, and biology. She received her master of education degree from <a href="Boston_University" title="wikilink">Boston University</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="world-war-ii-the-atomic-bomb">World War II: the atomic bomb</h2>
<p>Bachelder enlisted in the <a href="Women&#39;s_Army_Corps" title="wikilink">Women's Army Corps</a> (WAC) in November 1942, at the <a href="Springfield,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Springfield, Massachusetts</a> headquarters. After spending time in training at military bases in several U.S. states, she received orders assigning her to the Company 'D' WAC Detachment of the Manhattan District Corps of Engineers. Her secret assignment was to lead a group of 15 to 20 women from the WAC, stationed in <a href="Des_Moines,_Iowa" title="wikilink">Des Moines, Iowa</a>, to <a href="Fort_Sill" title="wikilink">Fort Sill, Oklahoma</a>, and from there to <a href="Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico" title="wikilink">Santa Fe, New Mexico</a>. She and the women under her command arrived at <a href="Los_Alamos,_New_Mexico" title="wikilink">Los Alamos, New Mexico</a> on October 21, 1943.</p>
<p>&quot;Manhattan&quot; was the code name for the special military division dedicated to developing an atomic weapon. In <a href="Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">the clandestine laboratory</a> at the remote Los Alamos desert site, Bachelder was responsible for the analysis of the <a href="spectroscopy" class="uri" title="wikilink">spectroscopy</a> of <a href="Isotopes_of_uranium" title="wikilink">uranium isotopes</a>. Since the <a href="uranium-235" class="uri" title="wikilink">uranium-235</a> isotope is <a href="fissile" class="uri" title="wikilink">fissile</a>, whereas the <a href="uranium-238" class="uri" title="wikilink">uranium-238</a> isotope is not, Bachelder's role in the project was a crucial task: to ensure the purity of the sub-critical material, and therefore the <a href="nuclear_explosion" title="wikilink">nuclear explosion</a>, of the world's first atomic bombs.</p>

Analogous methods were used for the uranium weapon, code-named &quot;<a href="Little_Boy" title="wikilink">Little Boy</a>&quot;, which destroyed <a href="Hiroshima" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hiroshima</a>, Japan on August 6, 1945, and for the plutonium bomb which <a href="Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki" title="wikilink">destroyed Nagasaki, Japan</a> on August 9, 1945, leading to the <a href="Japanese_surrender" title="wikilink">Japanese surrender</a>. The secret program was under the general direction of <a href="J._Robert_Oppenheimer" title="wikilink">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>, whom Bachelder described as: </p>

<p>The conclusion of the Second World War was also the dawning of a new &quot;Atomic Age&quot;, in which the peacetime potential of nuclear energy began to be explored. Bachelder was among the scientists who opposed the May-Johnson Bill of October 1945, a Congressional bill proposed by the <a href="Interim_Committee" title="wikilink">Interim Committee</a>, which would have maintained military control over nuclear research. The bill was defeated in Congress and superseded by the <a href="Atomic_Energy_Act_of_1946" title="wikilink">McMahon Atomic Energy Act</a>. In January 1947, the newly formed <a href="United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission" title="wikilink">Atomic Energy Commission</a> approved the declassification of 270 previously secret documents. These included discoveries related to <a href="X-radiation" class="uri" title="wikilink">X-radiation</a> and purification of <a href="uranium_ore" title="wikilink">uranium ores</a>, which had been made by Bachelder during the course of the war effort. At this time, the rarity and importance of Bachelder's achievements as a <a href="Women_in_science" title="wikilink">woman in science</a> were also acknowledged.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Henry_Moore_Nuclear_Energy.jpg" title="fig:Nuclear Energy, the sculpture commemorating the Manhattan Project site at the University of Chicago." alt="Nuclear Energy, the sculpture commemorating the Manhattan Project site at the University of Chicago." /> After leaving the Army, Bachelder became a research chemist at the <a href="University_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">University of Chicago</a>, where the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction had been achieved in 1942. <a href="Nobel_Prize" title="wikilink">Nobel Laureate</a> <a href="James_Franck" title="wikilink">James Franck</a> had been Director of the Chemistry Division of the <a href="Metallurgical_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Metallurgical Laboratory</a> during the earlier phases of the Manhattan Project. Bachelder joined the University's Institute for the Study of Metals (renamed as the James Franck Institute in 1967), and she conducted further research in metallochemistry.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Among other achievements, Bachelder developed methods for the purification of the rare elements <a href="tellurium" class="uri" title="wikilink">tellurium</a> and <a href="indium" class="uri" title="wikilink">indium</a>. Other aspects of her broad scientific expertise found application in the field of <a href="Maritime_archaeology" title="wikilink">marine archaeology</a>, when she determined the chemical composition of brass cannons found in the <a href="Aegean_Sea" title="wikilink">Aegean Sea</a> on sunken ships. She also made contributions to <a href="astrochemistry" class="uri" title="wikilink">astrochemistry</a>, when <a href="NASA" class="uri" title="wikilink">NASA</a> asked her to analyze the chemistry of <a href="Moon_rock" title="wikilink">Moon rocks</a> which had been collected from the Moon's surface during the <a href="Apollo_program" title="wikilink">Apollo missions</a> from 1969 to 1972.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Bachelder retired from the Franck Institute in 1973, and was subsequently active as an official of the <a href="AARP" title="wikilink">American Association of Retired Persons</a> (AARP).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> She died in Chicago on May 22, 1997.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>
<p>Bachelder believed that her role in the development of the atomic bomb, and the subsequent use of atomic weapons against Japan, had been justified, in order to end the Second World War, and to avoid greater loss of life that would have been entailed, in a U.S. land invasion and extended conflict with Japan. Later in life, during the period of the <a href="Strategic_Arms_Limitation_Talks" title="wikilink">Strategic Arms Limitation Talks</a>, Bachelder stated that, although she supported nuclear arms control: </p>
