During the <a href="1929_Hebron_massacre" title="wikilink">1929 Hebron massacre</a>, 67 Jews were killed by Arab rioters, and many incidents of rape, mutilation, and torture were reported.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> As a result, the Jewish community of 750 people was disbanded.

The vacillations in the Israeli cabinet after the Six Day War, over annexation and the political realism in wanting to maintain the majority Jewish demographic of Israel left the Israeli leadership in a quandary in ways to deal with the newly occupied territories.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Israel's position was that parts of the <a href="West_Bank" title="wikilink">West Bank</a> be <a href="land_for_peace" title="wikilink">traded for peace</a> with Jordan.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In what was called the <a href="Allon_Plan" title="wikilink">Allon Plan</a>, Israel was to annex 45% of the West Bank and Jordan the remainder.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

This was short lived and through a government compromise the Jewish presence was moved east to a nearby abandoned army camp. The new <a href="Israeli_settlement" title="wikilink">settlement</a> of <a href="Kiryat_Arba" title="wikilink">Kiryat Arba</a> was established.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> According to the American Jewish historian <a href="Ian_Lustik" title="wikilink">Ian Lustik</a>:</p>

<p>The government was caught by surprise. Internally divided, depending for its survival on the votes of the <a href="National_Religious_Party" title="wikilink">National Religious Party</a>, and reluctant to forcibly evacuate the settlers from a city whose Jewish population had been massacred thirty-nine years earlier, the <a href="Israeli_legislative_election,_1965" title="wikilink">Labor government</a> backed away from its original prohibition against civilian settlement in the area and permitted this group to remain within a military compound.

<p>Beginning in 1979, some Jewish settlers moved from Kiryat Arba to found the <a href="Committee_of_The_Jewish_Community_of_Hebron" title="wikilink">Committee of The Jewish Community of Hebron</a> in the former Jewish neighbourhood near the <a href="Abraham_Avinu_Synagogue" title="wikilink">Abraham Avinu Synagogue</a>, and later to other Hebron neighborhoods including <a href="Tel_Rumeida" title="wikilink">Tel Rumeida</a>.

<p>The Jewish <a href="Sephardic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sephardic</a> community had been in Hebron continuously for approximately 800 years and the <a href="Ashkenazi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ashkenazi</a> community had roots there that went back at for about one century.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Jews living in the new settlements and their supporters claim that they are resettling areas where Jews have lived since time immemorial.

<p>The sentiments of Jews who fled the <a href="1929_Hebron_massacre" title="wikilink">1929 Hebron massacre</a> and their descendants are mixed.

<p>The Hebron Jewish community has been subject to attacks by Palestinian militants since the Oslo agreement, especially during the periods of the Intifadas; which saw 3 fatal stabbings and 9 fatal shootings in between the first and second Intifada (0.9% of all fatalities in Israel and the West Bank) and 17 fatal shooting (9 soldiers and 8 settlers) and 2 fatalities from a bombing during the second Intifada.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> and thousands of rounds fired on it from the hills above the Abu-Sneina and Harat al-Sheikh neighbourhoods.

<p>An international civilian observer force, the TIPH was subsequently re-established on 14 May 1996 to help the normalization of the situation and to maintain a buffer between the Palestinian Arab population of the city and the Jews residing in their enclave in the old city during the handing over period to the <a href="Palestinian_Authority" title="wikilink">Palestinian Authority</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> On February 8, 2006, TIPH temporarily left Hebron after attacks on their headquarters by some Palestinians angered by the <a href="Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy" title="wikilink">Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy</a>.

<p>The city of Hebron has been a major friction point, with Palestinians and Israeli human rights groups accusing the hard-line religious settlers of attacking the Palestinian population with impunity.

<blockquote>
<p>Let there be no mistake about it. I am not from the UN. I am from the Israeli Defense Force. I did not come here to seek people to drink tea with, but first of all to ensure the security of the Jewish settlers.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p>Tivon later suggested that the &quot;Palestinian Authority is encouraging children to participate in clashes with the IDF by offering their families $300 per injury and $2,000 for anyone killed.
