<p><strong>Urmuz</strong> (, pen name of <strong>Demetru Dem. Demetrescu-Buz&lt;U+0103&gt;u</strong>, also known as <strong>Hurmuz</strong> or <strong>Cirivi&lt;U+015F&gt;</strong>, born <strong>Dimitrie Dim. Ionescu-Buzeu</strong>; March 17, 1883 &lt;U+2013&gt; November 23, 1923) was a <a href="Romania" title="wikilink">Romanian</a> writer, lawyer and civil servant, who became a cult hero in Romania's <a href="avant-garde" class="uri" title="wikilink">avant-garde</a> scene. His scattered work, consisting of <a href="Absurdism" title="wikilink">absurdist</a> short prose and poetry, opened a new genre in <a href="Romanian_literature" title="wikilink">Romanian letters</a> and <a href="Romanian_humor" title="wikilink">humor</a>, and captured the imagination of <a href="Modernist_literature" title="wikilink">modernists</a> for several generations. Urmuz's <em>Bizarre</em> (or <em>Weird</em>) <em>Pages</em> were largely independent of European modernism, even though some may have been triggered by <a href="Futurism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Futurism</a>; their valorization of <a href="nonsense_verse" title="wikilink">nonsense verse</a>, <a href="black_comedy" title="wikilink">black comedy</a>, <a href="Nihilism" title="wikilink">nihilistic</a> tendencies and exploration into the <a href="unconscious_mind" title="wikilink">unconscious mind</a> have repeatedly been cited as influential for the development of <a href="Dada" title="wikilink">Dadaism</a> and the <a href="Theatre_of_the_Absurd" title="wikilink">Theatre of the Absurd</a>. Individual pieces such as &quot;The Funnel and Stamate&quot;, &quot;Isma&lt;U+00EF&gt;l and Turnavitu&quot;, &quot;Algazy &amp; Grummer&quot; or &quot;The Fuchsiad&quot; are <a href="parody" class="uri" title="wikilink">parody</a> fragments, dealing with monstrous and <a href="shapeshifting" class="uri" title="wikilink">shapeshifting</a> creatures in mundane settings, and announcing techniques later taken up by <a href="Surrealism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Surrealism</a>.</p>
<p>Urmuz's biography between his high school eccentricity and his public suicide remains largely mysterious, and some of the sympathetic accounts have been described as purposefully deceptive. The abstruse imagery of his work has produced a large corpus of diverging interpretations. He has notably been read as a satirist of public life in the 1910s, an unlikely conservative and nostalgic, or an emotionally distant <a href="Esotericism" title="wikilink">esotericist</a>.</p>
<p>In Urmuz's lifetime, his stories were only acted out by his thespian friend <a href="George_Ciprian" title="wikilink">George Ciprian</a> and published as samples by <em><a href="Cuget_Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;nesc" title="wikilink">Cuget Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;nesc</a></em> newspaper, with support from modernist writer <a href="Tudor_Arghezi" title="wikilink">Tudor Arghezi</a>. Ciprian and Arghezi were together responsible for creating the link between Urmuz and the emerging avant-garde, their activity as Urmuz promoters being later enhanced by such figures as <a href="Ion_Vinea" title="wikilink">Ion Vinea</a>, <a href="Geo_Bogza" title="wikilink">Geo Bogza</a>, <a href="Lucian_Boz" title="wikilink">Lucian Boz</a>, <a href="Sa&lt;U+015F&gt;a_Pan&lt;U+0103&gt;" title="wikilink">Sa&lt;U+015F&gt;a Pan&lt;U+0103&gt;</a> and <a href="Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne_Ionesco" title="wikilink">Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne Ionesco</a>. Beginning in the late 1930s, Urmuz also became the focus interest for the elite critics, who either welcomed him into <a href="20th_century_in_literature" title="wikilink">20th-century literature</a> or dismissed him as a buffoonish impostor. By then, his activity also inspired an eponymous avant-garde magazine edited by Bogza, as well as Ciprian's drama <em><a href="The_Drake&#39;s_Head" title="wikilink">The Drake's Head</a></em>.</p>

<p>Mitic&lt;U+0103&gt; was the eldest son of a middle class nuclear family: his father, described by Ciprian as &quot;short and mean&quot; (<em>om scund &lt;U+015F&gt;i ciufut</em>),<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> worked as a physician.

<p>Ionescu-Buz&lt;U+0103&gt;u's family had artistic interests, and Urmuz grew up with a fascination for classical music and <a href="fine_art" title="wikilink">fine art</a>, learning to play the piano and taking up amateur <a href="oil_painting" title="wikilink">oil painting</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> He got along best with his mother, who was also a pianist.

<p>Urmuz's arrival to literary history took place in the atmosphere of Bucharest <a href="Gymnasium_(school)" title="wikilink">gymnasia</a>. It was at this junction that he became a mate of Ciprian, who later described their encounter as momentous: &quot;I don't much believe in destiny. [...] Yet I find it such an odd incident that my bench mate, from my failing grade year through to my high school graduation, was [...] this tiny man of a rare originality, who had a massive say on how my life would turn up.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Ciprian describes what follows as his own &quot;initiation in artistic matters&quot;: he recalls conversations with &quot;Cirivi&lt;U+015F&gt;&quot; where they debated the &quot;perfection&quot; of <a href="Ancient_Greek_sculpture" title="wikilink">Ancient Greek sculpture</a>, and mentions that young Urmuz, unlike himself, regarded theater as a &quot;minor art&quot;.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Instead, Urmuz preferred to attend concerts at the <a href="Romanian_Atheneum" title="wikilink">Romanian Atheneum</a>, and, Ciprian writes, had an advanced understanding of <a href="absolute_music" title="wikilink">absolute music</a> even at age thirteen.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Reportedly, the young man was also in the attendance at lectures given by <a href="Titu_Maiorescu" title="wikilink">Titu Maiorescu</a>, a philosopher and aesthete who had influenced both Eminescu and Caragiale.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

One such early episode is attested by Ciprian: amused by the creation of a <em>Vivat Dacia</em> (&quot;Long Live <a href="Dacia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dacia</a>&quot;) association of nationalist students, Urmuz subverted its meetings, and, with <a href="deadpan" class="uri" title="wikilink">deadpan</a> snark, suggested that membership fees should be paid in duck heads.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Also according to Ciprian, these events soon lost their shock value, leading him and Urmuz to &quot;take to the streets&quot;, where they began their activity as pranksters. Their initial experiment was to pressure law-abiding and credulous passers-by into presenting their identity papers for inspection, and the apparent success earned Urmuz an unexpected following in school (his fans even heckled <em>Vivat Dacia</em> into accepting poultry heads as means of payment, before the society dissolved itself with ceremony).<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Another colleague, future traditionalist poet <a href="Vasile_Voiculescu" title="wikilink">Vasile Voiculescu</a>, recalled young Urmuz as &quot;genially knavish&quot;, his humor being &quot;cerebral, harder to detect and appreciate&quot;.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>The core group of Urmuzian disciples, organized as a <a href="secret_society" title="wikilink">secret society</a>, comprised Ciprian (nicknamed &quot;Macferlan&quot; by Urmuz), Alexandru &quot;B&lt;U+0103&gt;l&lt;U+0103&gt;l&lt;U+0103&gt;u&quot; Bujoreanu and Costic&lt;U+0103&gt; &quot;Pentagon&quot; Grigorescu, together known as the <em>pahuci</em>. Allegedly, the obscure word originated from the <a href="Hebrew_language" title="wikilink">Hebrew</a> for &quot;yawns&quot;.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Their activity centered on daring pranks: Urmuz and the other three young men once made an impromptu visit to the isolated <a href="C&lt;U+0103&gt;ld&lt;U+0103&gt;ru&lt;U+015F&gt;ani_Monastery" title="wikilink">C&lt;U+0103&gt;ld&lt;U+0103&gt;ru&lt;U+015F&gt;ani Monastery</a>, in <a href="Ilfov_County" title="wikilink">Ilfov County</a>, where the deposed and disgraced <a href="Ghenadie_Petrescu" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Ghenadie</a> was living in banishment. Passing themselves off as newspaper editors, they demanded (and received) honored guest treatment, tested the monks' patience, and were later introduced to a well-disposed Ghenadie.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Ciprian also recalls that Urmuz's philosophical musings or deadpan <a href="surreal_humor" title="wikilink">surreal humor</a> were a direct inspiration for other pranks and experiments. He describes how Cirivi&lt;U+015F&gt; acted out sadness for the plight of a screechy sledge (declaring &quot;my heart is at one with all things in existence&quot;), but then duped onlookers into believing that the squeaks came from a woman somehow trapped under the vehicle.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Reportedly, Urmuz also approached his seniors training at <a href="Seminary" title="wikilink">seminaries</a> or other traditionalist institutions, earned their attention by claiming to share the nationalist agenda, and then began reciting them nonsense lyrics such as an evolving draft of his mock-<a href="fable" class="uri" title="wikilink">fable</a> &quot;The Chroniclers&quot;.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>Outside school, the young man was still introverted, and, Sandqvist notes, &quot;extremely shy, especially with girls.&quot;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Ciprian recalls Cirivi&lt;U+015F&gt;'s engrossing <a href="pick-up_line" title="wikilink">pick-up lines</a>: he acted familiar to the any young woman who caught his eye, assuring her that they had met once before, and, having stirred her curiosity, falsely recounting how they both used to kill <a href="Flesh-fly" title="wikilink">flesh-flies</a> for sport.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>pahuci</em> welcomed their graduation with one final act of defiance against the school principal, whom they visited in his office, where they began hopping about in circles.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Even though their group did not survive once its members took different career paths, they had regular reunions at the Spiru Godelea <a href="tavern" class="uri" title="wikilink">tavern</a>, where they earned notoriety for their rude and unconventional behavior.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Urmuz enrolled at the <a href="Carol_Davila_University_of_Medicine_and_Pharmacy" title="wikilink">Bucharest Medical School</a>, allegedly after pressures from his stern father.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> According to Ciprian, this training did not agree with his friend, who would complain of being &quot;unable to make himself understood by the cadavers.&quot;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> This was probably a sign that the young man could not bear to witness <a href="dissection" class="uri" title="wikilink">dissection</a>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> He eventually entered the <a href="University_of_Bucharest" title="wikilink">University of Bucharest</a> Faculty of Law, which was to be his <em>alma mater</em>,<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> while also taking lectures in composition and <a href="counterpoint" class="uri" title="wikilink">counterpoint</a> at the <a href="National_University_of_Music_Bucharest" title="wikilink">Music and Declamation Conservatory</a>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Additionally, he completed his first service term in the <a href="Romanian_Land_Forces" title="wikilink">Romanian Infantry</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Urmuz became head of his family in 1907. That year, his father and two younger brothers died, and his sister Eliza was married.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> He also continued to take the initiative in daring acts of <em><a href="&lt;U+00E9&gt;pater_le_bourgeois" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00E9&gt;pater le bourgeois</a></em>. Ciprian recalls the two of them renting a carriage which Urmuz would order around, making a right at every junction, and effectively going around in circles around the <a href="Palace_of_Justice_(Bucharest)" title="wikilink">Palace of Justice</a>. Urmuz then proceeded to pester the street vendors, stopping over to buy a random assortment of useless items: <a href="pretzel" title="wikilink">pretzels</a>, a pile of charcoal, and an old hen which he impaled on his walking cane.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<p>Having passed his law examination in 1904, Urmuz was first appointed judge in the rural locality of <a href="Cocu,_Arge&lt;U+015F&gt;" title="wikilink">Cocu (R&lt;U+0103&gt;chi&lt;U+0163&gt;ele)</a>, in <a href="Arge&lt;U+015F&gt;_County" title="wikilink">Arge&lt;U+015F&gt; County</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> It is probable that at around this stage (ca. 1908), he was committing to paper the first fragments in his collection <em>Bizarre Pages</em>, some of which were reportedly written during a family reunion in Cocu.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> According to Eliza Vorvoreanu, he was doing this mainly to entertain his mother and sisters,<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> but Urmuz also amused local potentates, one of whom even offered his daughter's hand in marriage (Urmuz refused).<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> At the time, Mitic&lt;U+0103&gt; also discovered his passion for <a href="modern_art" title="wikilink">modern art</a>: he was an admirer of <a href="Primitivism" title="wikilink">primitivist</a> sculptor <a href="Constantin_Br&lt;U+00E2&gt;ncu&lt;U+015F&gt;i" title="wikilink">Constantin Br&lt;U+00E2&gt;ncu&lt;U+015F&gt;i</a>, fascinated by his 1907 work <em>The Wisdom of the Earth</em>.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>These developments coincided with the outbreak of World War I. Between 1914 and summer 1916, when Romania was still neutral territory, Ciprian's efforts of circulating the <em>Bizarre Pages</em> may have reached a peak. Urmuz's texts were probably spread around in handwritten copies, becoming somewhat familiar to Bucharest's <a href="bohemian_society" title="wikilink">bohemian society</a>, but Urmuz himself was still an anonymous figure.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Both Ciprian and fellow actor <a href="Grigore_M&lt;U+0103&gt;rculescu" title="wikilink">Grigore M&lt;U+0103&gt;rculescu</a> are said to have given public readings from the <em>Bizarre Pages</em> at <a href="Casa_Cap&lt;U+015F&gt;a" title="wikilink">Casa Cap&lt;U+015F&gt;a</a> restaurant.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> According to literary historian <a href="Paul_Cernat" title="wikilink">Paul Cernat</a>, if rumors about Ciprian's early performances of Urmuz's texts are true, it would constitute one of the first samples of <a href="Experimental_theatre" title="wikilink">avant-garde shows</a> in <a href="Theater_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Romanian theatrical tradition</a>.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>Around 1916, Urmuz had obtained a relocation, as judge in the Muntenian town of <a href="Alexandria,_Romania" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a>.

<p>Urmuz was again in Bucharest, working as <em>grefier</em> (registrar or <a href="court_reporter" title="wikilink">court reporter</a>) at the <a href="High_Court_of_Cassation_and_Justice" title="wikilink">High Court of Cassation and Justice</a>; sources disagree on whether this appointment dated from 1918 or earlier.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a><a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Reportedly, this was a well paid employment with special perks, which may have made Urmuz uncomfortable about his other life as a bohemian hero.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> A photograph portrait taken in that period, one of the few to survive, was read as an additional clue that Urmuz had become <a href="melancholy" class="uri" title="wikilink">melancholy</a> and anxious.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Sandqvist also sees him as a &quot;catastrophically lonely&quot; and <a href="insomnia" title="wikilink">insomniac</a> customer of the <a href="brothel" title="wikilink">brothels</a>, adding: &quot;To all appearances as a result of disgusting experiences during the wars, returning home to Bucharest Demetru Demetrescu-Buz&lt;U+0103&gt;u chose to live an extremely ascetic and isolated life with long night walks.&quot;<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Urmuz's feats and pranks were nonetheless attracting more public attention, and he himself allegedly read his work to a bohemian public, in places such as <a href="Gabroveni_Inn" title="wikilink">Gabroveni Inn</a>; at least some of these were free exercises in <a href="oral_literature" title="wikilink">oral literature</a>, and as such entirely lost.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>The year 1922 brought Urmuz's debut in print. Fascinated by the (then unnamed) <em>Bizarre Pages</em>, poet and journalist <a href="Tudor_Arghezi" title="wikilink">Tudor Arghezi</a> included two of them in <em><a href="Cuget_Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;nesc" title="wikilink">Cuget Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;nesc</a></em> newspaper. Arghezi reportedly made efforts to persuade his more serious fellow editors of <em>Cuget</em>, and possibly intended to undermine their attempt of putting out a <a href="newspaper_of_record" title="wikilink">newspaper of record</a>.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a><a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> The gazette had also published a manifesto by Arghezi, in which he had outlined the goal of combating &quot;sterile literature&quot;, and his intention of cultivating the &quot;<a href="will_to_power" title="wikilink">will to power</a>&quot; in post-war literary culture.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Urmuz was thus the first avant-garde writer popularized by Arghezi, in a list which, by 1940, also came to include a large section of the younger Romanian modernists.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>Arghezi later wrote that his relationship with Urmuz was difficult, especially since the <em>grefier</em> panicked that the establishment would discover his other career: &quot;he feared that the Cassation Court would better detect him as <em>Urmuz</em> than under his own name&quot;.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> The memoirist refers to Demetrescu-Buz&lt;U+0103&gt;u's perfectionism and unease, enhanced in the week before publication: &quot;He would wake up in the middle of the night and would send a very urgent letter, asking me if the comma after a 'that' should be moved before. I found him wandering around my house at night, shy, restless, fainthearted or in a hopeful trance, that something of substance may or may not be found in his prose, that perhaps there's an error, asking me to publish it, and then again to destroy it; to publish it together with an eulogistic note, and then again to curse him. He bribed [the printers] to change phrases and words that I had to put back into place, as previous editorial interventions were for sure better than his.&quot;<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a><a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> The letters they exchanged show that the <em>grefier</em> was not enthusiastic about even seeing his texts and his pseudonym in print, to which Arghezi was replying: &quot;from among the few we'll be cooperating with, you were my first choice&quot;.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>By May 1922, Urmuz had grown more confident in his strength as a writer. He sent Arghezi a copy of the &quot;Algazy &amp; Grummer&quot; story, which, he joked, needed to be published for &quot;the nation's benefit&quot;.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> He also proposed headlining it with the additional title <em>Bizarre Pages</em>.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> The work was never published by <em>Cuget</em>, probably because of a change in priorities: around that date, the paper hosted traditionalist editorials by culture critic <a href="Nicolae_Iorga" title="wikilink">Nicolae Iorga</a>, which were incompatible with Arghezi's fronde.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="suicide">Suicide</h3>
<p>On November 23, 1923, Urmuz shot himself, an event which remains shrouded in mystery. His death occurred in a public location, described as being close to <a href="&lt;U+015E&gt;oseaua_Kiseleff" title="wikilink">Kiseleff Road</a> in northern Bucharest.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a><a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Some early sources suggest that he may have been suffering from an incurable disease,<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a><a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a><a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> but he is also argued to have been fascinated with guns and their destructive potential. In 1914 for instance, he wrote down in his papers a homage to revolvers, crediting them with a magical power over the suicidal brain.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a><a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> Reports also show that he was theorizing the purposelessness and hollowness of life, addressing his fears on the subject to family members during the funeral of his brother Constantin (also in 1914).<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> Researcher <a href="Geo_&lt;U+015E&gt;erban" title="wikilink">Geo &lt;U+015E&gt;erban</a> wrote about Demetrescu-Buz&lt;U+0103&gt;u's well-hidden disappointment, assessing that, during his final year, the writer continued to act cheerful and relaxed, but that a &quot;devastating&quot; tension was building up inside him.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> At around that time, Urmuz took his one real trip as an adult civilian, visiting the <a href="Budaki_Lagoon" title="wikilink">Budaki Lagoon</a> in <a href="Bessarabia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bessarabia</a>.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>Writing in 1927, Arghezi publicized his regret at not having cultivated the friendship: &quot;I never saw him again and I am weighed down by the irreparable grief of never seeking him out. I believe my optimism could have rekindled in his cerebral chaos those candid and pure things that were beginning to die.&quot;<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Several Urmuz exegetes have traditionally seen the suicide intrinsically linked to Urmuz's artistic attitude. For scholar Carmen Blaga, it was the &quot;dissolution of [his] faith&quot; in Romania's intellectual class, along with economic decline and &quot;an existential void&quot;, that prompted the writer to opt himself out.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> This resonates with claims by the first-generation followers of Urmuz: <a href="Geo_Bogza" title="wikilink">Geo Bogza</a> suggests that his mentor killed himself once the deconstructive process, performed by his &quot;sharp intellect&quot;, reached a natural conclusion;<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> <a href="Sa&lt;U+015F&gt;a_Pan&lt;U+0103&gt;" title="wikilink">Sa&lt;U+015F&gt;a Pan&lt;U+0103&gt;</a> claims that Urmuz was tired of merely amusing the &quot;cretins&quot; and &quot;profiteers&quot; who held sway over Bucharest's literary scene, and, determined to turn his literary persona into &quot;stardust&quot;, took the risk of destroying his physical self.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> Additionally, academic <a href="George_C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu" title="wikilink">George C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu</a> argued that there was a philosophical rationale &quot;very in tune with his century&quot;: &quot;he wanted to die in some original way, 'without any cause'.&quot;<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>
<p>Kept at the city morgue, the body was assigned to Urmuz's brother-in-law and fellow clerk C.

<p>Shortly after his death, Urmuz's work was linked to the emergence of avant-garde rebellion throughout Europe, and in particular to the rise of Romania's own modernist scene: writing in 2007, Paul Cernat describes this version of events as a &quot;<a href="Myth_of_origins" title="wikilink">founding myth</a>&quot; of Romanian avant-garde literature.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> A literary critic and modernist enthusiast, <a href="Lucian_Boz" title="wikilink">Lucian Boz</a>, assessed that Urmuz, like <a href="Arthur_Rimbaud" title="wikilink">Arthur Rimbaud</a> before him, embodied the &quot;lyrical <a href="nihilism" class="uri" title="wikilink">nihilism</a>&quot; of avant-garde currents.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> In the 1960s, literary historian <a href="Ovid_Crohm&lt;U+0103&gt;lniceanu" title="wikilink">Ovid Crohm&lt;U+0103&gt;lniceanu</a> wrote of his being &quot;the world's first pre-<a href="Dada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dada</a> exercises&quot;.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> In 2002 however, scholar Adrian L&lt;U+0103&gt;c&lt;U+0103&gt;tu&lt;U+015F&gt; revised this thesis, arguing that it had created a &quot;blockage&quot; in critical reception, and that the actual Urmuz had more complex views on the avant-garde.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> Others have emphasized that Urmuz's unusual revolt ran contemporary with the revival of intense traditionalism of Romanian literature (the <em><a href="S&lt;U+0103&gt;m&lt;U+0103&gt;n&lt;U+0103&gt;torul" class="uri" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+0103&gt;m&lt;U+0103&gt;n&lt;U+0103&gt;torul</a></em> moment), which would make his pre-Dada inspiration a moment of special significance.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a><a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a></p>
<p>The contact with <a href="Futurism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Futurism</a>, although acknowledged by Urmuz, is judged by many of his commentators as superficial and delayed.

<p>Various authors have also suggested that Urmuz was actually a radical conservative, whose vehemence against platitude in art only camouflaged a basic conventionalism. This perspective found its voice with L&lt;U+0103&gt;c&lt;U+0103&gt;tu&lt;U+015F&gt;, who sees Urmuz as a conservative heretic, equally annoyed by <a href="bourgeois" class="uri" title="wikilink">bourgeois</a> and <a href="anti-bourgeois" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-bourgeois</a> discourses.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> Writing in 1958, Ciprian also reflected on the possibility that Cirivi&lt;U+015F&gt; was actually &quot;teasing&quot; the avant-garde tendencies emerging in his day, but concluded: &quot;I would rather assume that under these various experiments was smoldering the lust for shaking the individual out of his skin, of tearing him away from himself, of disassembling him, of making him doubt the authenticity of accumulated knowledge.&quot;<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> He writes that Urmuz's work lashed out at &quot;human nature in its most intimate creases.&quot;<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> Accordingly, some authors have even considered Urmuz the inheritor of late-19th-century <a href="Decadent_movement" title="wikilink">Decadence</a><a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> or of a matured <a href="alexandrine" class="uri" title="wikilink">alexandrine</a> purity.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> In other such readings, Urmuz appears to lend his backing to the <a href="Sexism" title="wikilink">sexist</a><a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> or <a href="Antisemitism" title="wikilink">antisemitic</a><a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> viewpoints of his contemporaries.

<p>A section among Urmuz's commentators tends to classify him as a genial but superficial prankster, a buffoon rather than a serious author. Although sympathetic to Urmuz's work, George C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu called the <em>Bizarre Pages</em> &quot;an intelligent literary game&quot; of &quot;witty teenagers&quot;.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> The goal, C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu suggested, was &quot;purely epic&quot;, &quot;seeming to tell a story without in fact recounting anything&quot;.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> Another verdict of this kind belongs to aesthetician <a href="Tudor_Vianu" title="wikilink">Tudor Vianu</a>, who also believed that Urmuz was a satirist of <a href="automatic_behavior" title="wikilink">automatic behavior</a>, and fundamentally a sarcastic realist.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> More severe in tone, <a href="Pompiliu_Constantinescu" title="wikilink">Pompiliu Constantinescu</a> assessed that Urmuz was superficial, chaotic and amateurish, interesting to researchers only because of defying &quot;the bourgeois platitude&quot;.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> Contrarily, another <a href="interwar" class="uri" title="wikilink">interwar</a> exegete, <a href="Perpessicius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Perpessicius</a>, made ample efforts to rehabilitate Urmuz as a thoughtful literary figure with &quot;great creative verve&quot;, on the same level as Arghezi and poet <a href="Adrian_Maniu" title="wikilink">Adrian Maniu</a>.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
<p>Ciprian noted that Urmuz was unlike the &quot;cheeky, daring, disorganized&quot; pranksters whom he superficially resembled, that nothing in Urmuz's exterior gave the impression that he was in any way &quot;spoiled&quot;.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> Time, he suggests, did not alter Urumuz's &quot;attitude on life&quot;: &quot;Only now the about-turns were more daring and the tightrope acts was much more savvy.&quot;<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> In 1925, commenting on Urmuz's flair for depicting the &quot;overall pointlessness of [human] existence&quot;, Ciprian also argued: &quot;For the mediocre mindset, [Urmuz] may seem incoherent and unbalanced&lt;U+2014&gt;which is why his work is not addressed to the masses.&quot;<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> Critic Adrian G.

<p>A major disagreement among critics relates to Urmuz's ambiguous positioning, between literature, <a href="Anti-art" title="wikilink">antiliterature</a> and <a href="metafiction" class="uri" title="wikilink">metafiction</a>. In reference to the <em>Bizarre Pages</em>, Crohm&lt;U+0103&gt;lniceanu introduced the term &quot;antiprose&quot;.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> In Crohm&lt;U+0103&gt;lniceanu's view, the antiliterary &quot;device&quot; Urmuz invented is impersonal and regulated, in the manner of Dada &quot;<a href="Readymades_of_Marcel_Duchamp" title="wikilink">readymades</a>&quot;, but as such ingenious and therefore inimitable.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> Authors such as <a href="Adrian_Marino" title="wikilink">Adrian Marino</a>, <a href="Eugen_Negrici" title="wikilink">Eugen Negrici</a>, <a href="Lucian_Raicu" title="wikilink">Lucian Raicu</a> and <a href="Mircea_Scarlat" title="wikilink">Mircea Scarlat</a> have spoken about Urmuz as a revolutionist of language, who liberated texts from coherence and even <a href="semantics" class="uri" title="wikilink">semantics</a>; whereas others&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="Livius_Cioc&lt;U+00E2&gt;rlie" title="wikilink">Livius Cioc&lt;U+00E2&gt;rlie</a>, <a href="Radu_Petrescu" title="wikilink">Radu Petrescu</a>, <a href="Ion_Pop_(literary_historian)" title="wikilink">Ion Pop</a>, <a href="Nicolae_Manolescu" title="wikilink">Nicolae Manolescu</a>, <a href="Marin_Mincu" title="wikilink">Marin Mincu</a>, <a href="Mihai_Zamfir" title="wikilink">Mihai Zamfir</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;have regarded him as mainly a textualist, interested in reusing and redefining the limits of poetry or narration, but creating a coherent, if personal, universe.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> According to Vasile Andru, Urmuzian literature is by definition open to all these associations, its antiliterary aspects illustrating the modern gap between &quot;<a href="Nature_versus_nurture" title="wikilink">nature and nurture</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> Critic C.

<p>As <a href="Vasile_Voiculescu" title="wikilink">Vasile Voiculescu</a> recalls, Urmuz had was genuinely &quot;tormented by <a href="Metaphysics" title="wikilink">metaphysical</a> matters&quot;.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> Some of Urmuz's commentators therefore discussed him as a reader of the <a href="unconscious_mind" title="wikilink">unconscious mind</a> or propagator of <a href="Esotericism" title="wikilink">esoteric</a> knowledge, suggesting that a hidden layer of mystical symbolism can be discerned in all his activities. According to Perpessicius, the <em>Bizarre Pages</em> as a whole carry a <a href="subtext" class="uri" title="wikilink">subtext</a> of <a href="Mythopoeia_(genre)" title="wikilink">mythopoeia</a>, or &quot;fragments of a new <a href="mythology" class="uri" title="wikilink">mythology</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> Boz also drew a comparison between Urmuz and the morose poems of <a href="George_Bacovia" title="wikilink">George Bacovia</a>, arguing that they both send the reader on &quot;tragic explorations&quot; and &quot;journeys to the underworld&quot;.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> In Boz's interpretation, Urmuz was not at all a humorist, but rather one who issued a solitary &quot;call to order&quot; and, creating a &quot;magical phenomenon&quot;, elevated his reader above the realities of the flesh.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> He first discussed the connection between the <em>Bizarre Pages</em> and 1930s <a href="Surrealism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Surrealism</a>, which likewise turned its attention to the <a href="abnormal_psychology" title="wikilink">abnormal psychology</a>, to &quot;<a href="psychosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychosis</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="dementia" class="uri" title="wikilink">dementia</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> The theoretical proto-Surrealism of such works, which places less importance on their topical humor, has generated a long debate between scholars later in the 20th century: some have denied Urmuzian Surrealism, whereas others have continued to identify him as the earliest Romanian Surrealist.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Simona_Popescu" title="wikilink">Simona Popescu</a>, the poet-essayist, presumes that Urmuz's inner motivation was his &quot;psycho-mania&quot;, which holds no respect for either convention or posterity, but only for committing one's own &quot;abyssal obsessions&quot; to paper: &quot;death, <a href="Eros_(concept)" title="wikilink">the Eros</a>, creation, and destruction.&quot;<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> Adrian L&lt;U+0103&gt;c&lt;U+0103&gt;tu&lt;U+015F&gt; also makes note of Urmuz's ambiguous allusions to <a href="autoeroticism" class="uri" title="wikilink">autoeroticism</a>, <a href="incest" class="uri" title="wikilink">incest</a>, <a href="bisexuality" class="uri" title="wikilink">bisexuality</a> or <a href="paraphilia" class="uri" title="wikilink">paraphilia</a>.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> Additionally, various commentators suggest that Urmuz's creative spark hides an unresolved conflict with his father. According to Cernat, Urmuz was in conflict with &quot;paternal authority&quot; and more attached to his mother, an &quot;<a href="Oedipus_complex" title="wikilink">Oedipus complex</a>&quot; also found in some other literary figures of the pre-modernist generation.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> Others too see in Cirivi&lt;U+015F&gt;'s pranks a planned revenge against parental and social pressures.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a><a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> His sister Eliza credited such accounts, by noting: &quot;You can tell he failed in life because he obeyed his parents blindly, and perhaps also in part due to his lack of will, his shyness, his fear of the public.&quot;<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a></p>

<p>Definitions vary in respect to the exact nature and species of Urmuz's <a href="Experimental_literature" title="wikilink">experimental</a> works, which are prose-like in content.

<p>According to Ciprian, one of Urmuz's earliest prose fragments was composed, with &quot;The Chroniclers&quot;, during <em>pahuci</em> escapades. Its opening words, Ciprian recalls, were: &quot;The deputy arrived in a brick and tile cart. He was bringing no news, but offered his friends, upon arrival, a few <a href="Leclanch&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leclanch&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> batteries&quot;.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> The same author suggests that these drafts were much inferior to Urmuz's published works, beginning with &quot;Algazy &amp; Grummer&quot;.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a></p>
<p>In its definitive version, the Algazy piece offers a glimpse into the strange life and <a href="Cannibalism" title="wikilink">cannibalistic</a> death of its storekeeper characters: Algazy, &quot;a nice old man&quot; with his beard &quot;neatly laid out on a grill [...] surrounded by barbed wire&quot;, &quot;does not speak any <a href="Languages_of_Europe" title="wikilink">European languages</a>&quot; and feeds on municipal waste; Grummer, who has &quot;a <a href="Humorism" title="wikilink">bilious temper</a>&quot; and &quot;a beak of aromatic wood&quot;, spends most time lying under the counter, but sometimes assaults customers in the middle of conversations about sports or literature. When Algazy discovers that his associate has digested, without giving a thought to sharing, &quot;all that was good in literature&quot;, he takes his revenge by consuming Grummer's rubbery bladder. A race begins as to who can eat the other first. Their few remains are later discovered by the authorities, and one of Algazy's many wives sweeps them up into oblivion.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> A different, early variant is quoted &quot;from memory&quot; and commented in Ciprian. In this account, Algazy the storekeeper is persuaded by his domineering wife to make their only son a magistrate. Grummer prepares the boy for his unexpected <a href="novitiate" class="uri" title="wikilink">novitiate</a>, strapping him down to the floor of a cave that must have the scent of <a href="Colt_(horse)" title="wikilink">colts</a>.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a></p>
<p>From its very title, &quot;Algazy &amp; Grummer&quot; references a defunct firm of suitcase manufacturers. Urmuz's own note to the text apologizes for this, explaining that the names' &quot;musicality&quot; is more suited to the two fictional characters than to their real-life models, and suggesting that the company should change name (or that its patrons must adapt their physical shape accordingly).<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a><a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a><a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> The narrative may hint to the everyday tensions between these entrepreneurs, and perhaps to the boredom of a career in sales;<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a> according to philologist Simona Constantinovici, it is also the confrontation of an entrepreneurial <a href="Turks_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Turk</a> (Algazy) and an intellectual <a href="History_of_the_Jews_in_Romania" title="wikilink">Jew</a> (Grummer), represented as a fight between the <a href="ostrich" class="uri" title="wikilink">ostrich</a> and the <a href="platypus" class="uri" title="wikilink">platypus</a>.<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a> Beyond the mundane pretext, the story was often described as Urmuz's manifesto against any <a href="literary_technique" title="wikilink">literary technique</a>,<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a><a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a><a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a><a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a><a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a> and even a witty meditation on the <a href="Sign_(semiotics)" title="wikilink">signified and signifier</a>.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a><a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a><a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a><a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a> Carmen Blaga further proposes that Urmuz philosophic intent is to show the gap between universe, in which all things are possible and random, and man, who demands familiarity and structure.<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a></p>

[...] Always the same slopes? the same <a href="Compass_(drafting)" title="wikilink">compasses</a>? the same people? the same beards?&quot;<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> The result, Sandqvist writes, is &quot;breakneck, absurd, and inordinately grotesque.&quot;<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a> C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu singled out the work: &quot;The best of his absurd pieces is 'Isma&lt;U+00EF&gt;l and Turnavitu', the solemnly academic portraiture and parody of bourgeois mannerisms, where there's always a confusion being made between the three kingdoms, the animal, the vegetal and the mineral&quot;.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a></p>
<p>Isma&lt;U+00EF&gt;l &quot;is made up of eyes, sideburns, and a dress&quot;, tied with rope to a badger and stumbling down Arionoaia Street. Protected from &quot;legal responsibility&quot; in the country (&quot;a seed-bed at the bottom of a hole in <a href="Dobruja" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dobruja</a>&quot;), the creature raises an entire badger colony: some he eats raw, with lemon; the others, once they have turned sixteen, he rapes &quot;without the smallest qualm of conscience.&quot; The seed-bed is where Isma&lt;U+00EF&gt;l also interviews job applicants, received on the condition that they hatch him &quot;four eggs each&quot;. The process is supported by his &quot;<a href="Chamberlain_(office)" title="wikilink">chamberlain</a>&quot; Turnavitu, who exchanges love letters with the applicants. Isma&lt;U+00EF&gt;l's actual residence is kept a secret, but it is presumed that he lives, sequestered from &quot;the corruption of electoral mores&quot;, in an attic above the home of his grotesquely disfigured father, only to emerge in a <a href="ball_gown" title="wikilink">ball gown</a> for the yearly celebration of <a href="plaster" class="uri" title="wikilink">plaster</a>. He then offers his body to the workers, in hopes of thus resolving &quot;the labor issue&quot;. Whereas Isma&lt;U+00EF&gt;l has once worked as an air fan for &quot;dirty <a href="Greeks_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Greek</a> coffee houses&quot; in the <a href="Lipscani" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lipscani</a> quarter, Turnavitu has a past in &quot;politics&quot;: he was for long the government-appointed air fan at the fire precinct kitchen. Isma&lt;U+00EF&gt;l has spared Turnavitu a life of near constant rotation, remunerating his services: the seed-bed interviews, the ritualized apologizes to the leashed badgers, the praise of Isma&lt;U+00EF&gt;l's fashion sense, and the swabbing of <a href="canola" class="uri" title="wikilink">canola</a> over Isma&lt;U+00EF&gt;l's gowns. Their relationship breaks down as Turnavitu, returning from the <a href="Balearic_Islands" title="wikilink">Balearic Islands</a> in the form of a <a href="jerrycan" class="uri" title="wikilink">jerrycan</a>, passes the <a href="common_cold" title="wikilink">common cold</a> to Isma&lt;U+00EF&gt;l's badgers. Sacked from his job, he contemplates suicide (&quot;not before seeing to the extraction of four <a href="Canine_tooth" title="wikilink">canines</a> in his mouth&quot;), and hurls himself into a pyre made up of Isma&lt;U+00EF&gt;l's dresses; the patron falls into depression and &quot;decrepitude&quot;, retreating to his seed-bed for the rest of his own life.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a></p>
<p>Like &quot;Algazy &amp; Grummer&quot;, &quot;Isma&lt;U+00EF&gt;l and Turnavitu&quot; probably has a skeletal structure borrowed from real life: Turnavitu was a distinguished clan within Bucharest's Greek nobility, tracing its origin back to the <a href="Phanariote" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phanariote</a> era.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a> The semi-fictional world is populated by other symbols of Romania's connection to the Orient, that are meant to evoke &quot;the banality of a distinctively Balkan scenery&quot; (Carmen Blaga).<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> Other interpretations have seen in the two protagonists caricatures of political corruption and <em><a href="parvenu" class="uri" title="wikilink">parvenu</a></em> morals.<a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-funnel-and-stamate">&quot;The Funnel and Stamate&quot;</h3>
<p>&quot;The Funnel and Stamate&quot; insists on the geographical setting of Urmuzian misadventures. Stamate's townhouse is a haven for objects or beings, their presence inventoried over several rooms. Only accessible through a tube, the windowless first room holds together a sample of the <a href="Noumenon" title="wikilink">thing-in-itself</a>, the statue of a <a href="Transylvania" title="wikilink">Transylvanian</a> priest and grammarian, and two humans always &quot;in the process of <a href="Human_evolution" title="wikilink">descending from the ape</a>&quot;. The second room, decorated in &quot;<a href="Ottoman_architecture" title="wikilink">Turkish style</a>&quot; and &quot;eastern luxury&quot;, is painted once a day and carefully measured, by compass, to prevent shrinkage. A third section, under the &quot;Turkish&quot; room, houses a limitless canal, a tiny room and a stake &quot;to which the entire Stamate family is tethered.&quot; The &quot;dignified&quot; and &quot;<a href="Ellipse" title="wikilink">elliptical</a>&quot; head of the clan spits chewed-up <a href="celluloid" class="uri" title="wikilink">celluloid</a> on his fat boy Bufty, who &quot;pretends not to notice&quot;. For relaxation, the Stamates contemplate <a href="Nirvana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nirvana</a>, located over the canal and &quot;in the same precinct&quot; as them. Old Stamate's musings are interrupted by the provocative intrusion of a <a href="siren" class="uri" title="wikilink">siren</a>, who lures him into the deep by presenting him with &quot;an innocent and too decent looking funnel.&quot; Stamate returns &quot;a better and more tolerant man&quot;, deciding to use the funnel for both the pleasures of sex and those of science. Neglecting his family duties, he goes on nightly expeditions into the funnel, until he discovers in horror that Bufty uses the funnel for a similar purpose. Stamate then decides to part with his wife (sewing her in a bag, to &quot;preserve the cultural traditions of his family&quot;) and with Bufty: trapped in the funnel, the boy is sent over to Nirvana, where Stamate makes sure he becomes a &quot;bureau sub-chief&quot;. Stamate is left alone to contemplate his plight, wandering to and fro at great speed, and submerging &quot;into micro-infinity.&quot;<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a></p>
<p>As an early supporter of Urmuz, Ciprian spoke of &quot;The Funnel and Stamate&quot; as &quot;without parallel&quot; in its satire of family life, suggesting that the scene were all the Stamates are tied to a single stake is &quot;more evocative than hundreds of pages from a novel&quot;<a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> (part of the story has also been read as a sexist joke on fashionable <a href="androgyny" class="uri" title="wikilink">androgyny</a>, since Stamate has a &quot;tonsured and legitimate wife&quot;).<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> Urmuz's original version in fact carries the subtitle &quot;A Four-Part Novel&quot;, in which Paul Cernat reads the intention of parodying the staple genres of traditional literature;<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a> according to Ioana P&lt;U+00E2&gt;rvulescu, the definition needs to be taken seriously, and makes the text (&quot;perhaps the shortest [novel] in <a href="European_literature" title="wikilink">European literature</a>&quot;) a &quot;microscopic&quot; Romanian equivalent of modernist works by <a href="James_Joyce" title="wikilink">James Joyce</a>.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> Linguist Anca Davidoiu-Roman notes: &quot;Urmuz's <a href="antinovel" class="uri" title="wikilink">antinovel</a> [...] apparently preserves the structures of the novelistic genre, but undermines them from the inside, cultivating the absurd, the black humor, [...] the nonsensical and the <a href="zeugma" class="uri" title="wikilink">zeugma</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a> The core theme is believed to be sexual: a paraphrase of <em><a href="Romeo_and_Juliet" title="wikilink">Romeo and Juliet</a></em>, with Stamate as the ridiculously abstract thinker falling for the debased stand-in of <a href="femininity" class="uri" title="wikilink">femininity</a>;<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> or even the detailed creation of &quot;an aberrant mechanism for erotic gratification.&quot;<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a> Stamate himself is also described as standing in for &quot;the unimaginative bourgeois&quot;.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Theodor_Fuchs.jpg" title="fig:Photograph of Theodor Fuchs, ca. 1900" alt="Photograph of Theodor Fuchs, ca. 1900" width="230" /> Another one of Urmuz's prose creations is &quot;The Fuchsiad&quot;, subtitled &quot;An Heroic-Erotic Musical Poem in Prose&quot;. Among the scholars, <a href="Perpessicius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Perpessicius</a> was first to argue that the subtext here is a direct reference to <a href="Greek_mythology" title="wikilink">Greek mythology</a> and <a href="Norse_paganism" title="wikilink">Norse paganism</a>, re-contextualized &quot;with the sadistic pleasure of children who take apart their dolls&quot;.<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a><a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a> The protagonist Fuchs is an eminently musical creature, who came into the world not out of his mother's womb, but through his grandmother's ear. At the conservatory, he turns into &quot;the perfect <a href="Chord_(music)" title="wikilink">chord</a>&quot;, but out of modesty spends most of his education hiding at the bottom of a piano. Puberty comes and he grows &quot;some kind of genitalia&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;in fact a &quot;<a href="fig_leaf" title="wikilink">fig leaf</a>&quot; which keeps rejuvenating. The actual story begins on the one night Fuchs spends in the open air: under the spell of its mysteries, the composer finds his way into Traian Street (Bucharest's <a href="red-light_district" title="wikilink">red-light district</a>).</p>
<p>There, a group of &quot;<a href="Vestal_Virgin" title="wikilink">vestals</a>&quot; whisks him away, praying to be shown the beauty of &quot;immaterial love&quot; and begging him to play a <a href="sonata" class="uri" title="wikilink">sonata</a>. His music is heard by the goddess <a href="Venus_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Venus</a>, and she is instantly &quot;defeated by passion&quot;, asking Fuchs to join her on <a href="Mount_Olympus" title="wikilink">Mount Olympus</a>. The act of lovemaking between clueless, overanxious Fuchs and the giant goddess is a disaster, particularly after the former decides to enter his whole body into Venus' ear. The embarrassed and angered audience humiliates the guest and banishes him to <a href="Venus" title="wikilink">the planet Venus</a>; merciful <a href="Athena" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athena</a> allows him to return home, but on condition he does not reproduce. However, Fuchs still decides to spend some of his time practicing his lovemaking on Traian Street, hoping that Venus will grant him a second chance, and believing that he and the goddess could breed a race of <a href="&lt;U+00DC&gt;bermensch" title="wikilink">Supermen</a>. In the end, the prostitutes also reject his advances, deeming him a &quot;dirty <a href="satyr" class="uri" title="wikilink">satyr</a>&quot;, no longer capable of immaterial love. The story ends with Fuchs' flight to into &quot;boundless nature&quot;, whence his music &quot;has been beaming away with equal force in all directions&quot;, fulfilling his destiny as an enemy of inferior art.<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="emil-gayk-and-going-abroad">&quot;Emil Gayk&quot; and &quot;Going Abroad&quot;</h3>
<p>The &quot;Emil Gayk&quot; sketch was the only one which is precisely dated to the early stages of World War I, focusing its satire on the debates of neutralists and interventionists.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a> Gayk, the ever-vigilant, gun-tauting, bird-like civilian, who sleeps in his <a href="tailcoat" class="uri" title="wikilink">tailcoat</a> but otherwise wears only a <a href="festoon" title="wikilink">festooned</a> drape, swims about in just one direction (&quot;for fear of coming out of his neutrality&quot;) and gets inspired by the military muses. His career is in foreign relations, which he revolutionizes with such novel ideas as the negotiated annexation of a <a href="One-dimensional_space" title="wikilink">unidimensional</a>, arrow-like, territory at <a href="N&lt;U+0103&gt;s&lt;U+0103&gt;ud" class="uri" title="wikilink">N&lt;U+0103&gt;s&lt;U+0103&gt;ud</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;pointed toward <a href="Luxembourg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luxembourg</a>, in memory of the <a href="German_occupation_of_Luxembourg_in_World_War_I" title="wikilink">1914 invasion</a>. Gayk has an adoptive daughter, educated on his behalf by waiters, who makes her home in the fields and eventually demands access to the sea. Angered by this claim, Gayk begins a large-scale war against her; the conflict ends in a stalemate, as Gayk can no longer accessorize his marshal's uniform, and the girl has lost her supplies of gasoline and beans. The father is placated with regular gifts of <a href="feed_grain" title="wikilink">feed grain</a>, whereas the daughter is allowed a two-centimeter-wide littoral.<a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260"><sup>260</sup></a></p>
<p>In its subtext, &quot;Emil Gayk&quot; teases the <a href="Irredentism" title="wikilink">irredentist</a> ambitions of the interventionist camp, in respect to <a href="Transylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transylvania</a> province. Urmuz quotes a humorous slogan, circulated as a lampoon of nationalist attitudes: &quot;Transylvania without the Transylvanians&quot;. This probably references the fact that, although Romanian by culture or ethnicity, many Transylvanian intellectuals were primarily the loyal subjects of the <a href="Habsburg_Monarchy" title="wikilink">Habsburg Monarchy</a>.<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a> According to Crohm&lt;U+0103&gt;lniceanu, the actual purpose is to overturn &quot;ossified&quot; constructs, as in the case of territorial demands which cover no real surface.<a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262"><sup>262</sup></a> Similarly, &lt;U+015E&gt;erban speaks about &quot;Emil Gayk&quot; as a piece in which magnified &quot;paltry aspects&quot; and &quot;anomalies&quot; are supposed to send the reader into a &quot;state of vigil&quot;.<a href="#fn263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263"><sup>263</sup></a></p>
<p>The plot of &quot;Going Abroad&quot; depicts someone's convoluted attempt to leave the country for good. The unnamed seven-year-old &quot;he&quot; in the story settles his scores with the assistance of &quot;two old ducks&quot; and embarks for the voyage, only to be pulled back in by &quot;paternal feelings&quot;; he consequently isolates himself in a tiny room, where he converts to Judaism, punishes his servants, celebrates his <a href="Silver_Jubilee" title="wikilink">Silver Jubilee</a>, and rethinks his escape.

<p>&quot;Going Abroad&quot; is possibly about Urmuz's own difficulties in deciding his own fate, transposed into a faux sample of <a href="travel_literature" title="wikilink">travel literature</a>, an example of what Balot&lt;U+0103&gt; calls the failed <em>homo viator</em> (&quot;human pilgrim&quot;) in Urmuz.<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267"><sup>267</sup></a></p>

<p>Two samples of Urmuz's prose have been traditionally seen as his secondary, less relevant, contributions.

<p>&quot;A Little Metaphysics and Astronomy&quot;, which is structured like a treatise, opens with a pun on the <a href="Genesis_creation_narrative" title="wikilink">creation narrative</a>, postulating that God created <a href="fingerspelling" class="uri" title="wikilink">fingerspelling</a> before &quot;the Word&quot;, and venturing to suggest that &quot;the heavenly bodies&quot;, like abandoned children, are in fact nobody's creation, that their spin is really a form of <a href="attention_seeking" title="wikilink">attention seeking</a>. Here, Urmuz questions the possibility of a single cause in the universe, since God's interest is in unnecessary duplications or multitudes in stars, men and fish species.<a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273"><sup>273</sup></a> Beyond the jokes on scientific pretense, Vasilache reads &quot;A Little Metaphysics...&quot; as a clue to Urmuz's own disillusioned worldview, which she traces back to the suicidal warnings in Urmuz's notebooks. She argues that such a melancholy and lonely diarist is in contrast with Urmuz's literary persona, as known from the <em>Bizarre Pages</em>.<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a> Likewise, Carmen Blaga describes the text as a sober meditation on &quot;the tragic sense of history&quot; and &quot;the fall into <a href="temporality" class="uri" title="wikilink">temporality</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275"><sup>275</sup></a></p>
<p>Among the last Urmuzian works to be discovered is &quot;Cotadi and Dragomir&quot;.

For fun, he lures his clients into angry conversations&lt;U+2014&gt;these end with him banging the piano lid, which is also a urinating wall, on the shop's floor. Dragomir is long, crooked, brownish and kind-hearted; he intervenes in the disputes between Cotadi and the more stubborn customers, imposing respect with his main prop: a cardboard contraption that extends upwards from his neck. Cotadi rewards such attentions with servings of octopus, <a href="Sorbus_domestica" title="wikilink">sorb-pears</a> and paint, granting Dragomir the right to nest inside his gate wall. They plan to be buried together, &quot;in the same hole&quot;, with French oil as a daily supply.

<p>While his role as a pre-Dadaist is up for debate, Urmuz is thought by many to have been a considerable influence on a Romanian founder of Dada, <a href="Tristan_Tzara" title="wikilink">Tristan Tzara</a>.<a href="#fn301" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref301"><sup>301</sup></a><a href="#fn302" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref302"><sup>302</sup></a><a href="#fn303" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref303"><sup>303</sup></a> During its first years, the Romanian avant-garde would generally not mention Urmuz outside Arghezi's circle, but a surge in popularity came in stages after the European-wide impact of Dadaism, and especially after Tzara alienated some of his Romanian partners. This was the case of poet <a href="Ion_Vinea" title="wikilink">Ion Vinea</a> and painter <a href="Marcel_Janco" title="wikilink">Marcel Janco</a>, who together founded a modernist art magazine called <em><a href="Contimporanul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Contimporanul</a></em>.
