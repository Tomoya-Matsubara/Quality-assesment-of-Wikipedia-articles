<p>Smith travelled east, working a job in the <a href="Kansas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kansas</a> wheat fields. In 1921 he joined the <a href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World" title="wikilink">Industrial Workers of the World</a> (IWW) as a member of <a href="Agricultural_Workers&#39;_Industrial_Union,_No._110" title="wikilink">Agricultural Workers' Industrial Union, No. 110</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He later followed the harvest to <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, before heading for <a href="Seattle,_Washington" title="wikilink">Seattle, Washington</a>, where he became editor of the IWW's west coast newspaper, <em><a href="The_Industrial_Worker" title="wikilink">The Industrial Worker</a>.</em><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Smith joined the local &quot;Marxian Club&quot; in Seattle in 1922 &lt;U+2014&gt; this at a time when the <a href="Communist_Party_of_America" title="wikilink">Communist Party of America</a> was a secret (&quot;underground&quot;) organization. Smith later recalled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I read <a href="Karl_Marx" title="wikilink">Marx's</a> <em><a href="Das_Kapital" title="wikilink">Capital</a></em> and decided that the Communists probably had the right idea and joined the Marxian Club. This club was a legal group in Seattle under the influence of the underground Communist Parties. I never got into the underground movement, but went with the club into the Workers Party when the club joined the Party in a body immediately after the organization of the Workers Party [in December 1921].&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the IWW turned against the Communists in 1922, Smith remained in the union under the direction of the Workers Party in Seattle.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Smith remained as editor of the paper until June of 1923, at which time the IWW sent him to <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a> to edit the organization's primary English-language newspaper, <em><a href="Industrial_Solidarity" title="wikilink">Industrial Solidarity</a>.</em><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> He was also the assistant manage of the IWW's Educational Bureau in 1924.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Smith was exposed as a secret member of the Workers (Communist) Party in 1926 and fired from his position as editor of <em>Industrial Solidarity.</em> He was immediately taken onto the staff of the Communist Party's daily newspaper, <em><a href="The_Daily_Worker" title="wikilink">The Daily Worker</a>,</em> also published in Chicago at the time.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> When the paper moved to <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> in 1927, Smith moved with it, remaining on the staff for the rest of the 1920s and throughout most of the 1930s, save for a 7 month period when he was made editor of <em><a href="Labor_Unity" title="wikilink">Labor Unity</a>,</em> the monthly magazine of the <a href="Trade_Union_Unity_League" title="wikilink">Trade Union Unity League</a>, an affiliate of the Communist Party.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>During the <a href="Harlan_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Harlan County, Kentucky</a> mine strikes of the early 1930s, Smith was dispatched to the area as <em>The Daily Worker's</em> correspondent. Smith was arrested along with a number of strike organizers and relief workers and was incarcerated for four months in the Harlan County jail, the last 31 days of which were in solitary confinement.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>In August 1933, Smith was made the Moscow correspondent of <em>The Daily Worker.</em> During his stint there, he wrote two books highly favorable to the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet system</a>, one dealing with coal miners in the <a href="Donets_Basin" title="wikilink">Donets Basin</a> and the other with workers on a Soviet <a href="collective_farm" title="wikilink">collective farm</a>.</p>
<p>Smith returned to California after his time in Moscow, as labor editor and foreign editor of the CP's California newspaper, the <em><a href="People&#39;s_Daily_World" title="wikilink">People's Daily World</a>.</em><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He also taught in <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a> at the Tom Mooney Labor School, a Communist Party educational project.</p>
