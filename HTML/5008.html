<p>A <strong>trade union</strong> (<a href="British_English" title="wikilink">British English</a> and <a href="Australian_English" title="wikilink">Australian English</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; <strong>trades union</strong> is also used), <strong>labour union</strong> (<a href="Canadian_English" title="wikilink">Canadian English</a>) or <strong>labor union</strong> (<a href="Comparison_of_American_and_British_English" title="wikilink">American English</a>) is an <a href="political_organisation#Labour_Unions" title="wikilink">organization of workers</a> who have united together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, safety standards, and better <a href="working_conditions" title="wikilink">working conditions</a>. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (<a href="wikt:rank_and_file" title="wikilink">rank and file</a> members) and negotiates <a href="Labour_and_employment_law" title="wikilink">labour contracts</a> (<a href="collective_bargaining" title="wikilink">collective bargaining</a>) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is &quot;maintaining or improving the conditions of their <a href="employment" class="uri" title="wikilink">employment</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> This may include the negotiation of <a href="wage" title="wikilink">wages</a>, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits, <a href="Occupational_safety_and_health" title="wikilink">workplace safety</a> and policies.</p>
<p>Unions may organize a particular section of skilled workers (<a href="craft_unionism" title="wikilink">craft unionism</a>),<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> a cross-section of workers from various trades (<a href="general_union" title="wikilink">general unionism</a>),<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> or attempt to organize all workers within a particular industry (<a href="industrial_unionism" title="wikilink">industrial unionism</a>).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The agreements negotiated by a union are binding on the rank and file members and the employer and in some cases on other non-member workers. Trade unions traditionally have a constitution which details the governance of their bargaining unit and also have governance at various levels of government depending on the industry that binds them legally to their negotiations and functioning.</p>
<p>Originating in <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>, trade unions became popular in many countries during the <a href="Industrial_Revolution" title="wikilink">Industrial Revolution</a>, when the lack of skill necessary to perform most jobs  shifted employment <a href="bargaining_power" title="wikilink">bargaining power</a> almost completely to the employers' side, causing many workers to be mistreated and underpaid. Trade unions may be composed of individual <a href="workers" class="uri" title="wikilink">workers</a>, <a href="professionals" class="uri" title="wikilink">professionals</a>, <a href="retiree" title="wikilink">past workers</a>, <a href="students" class="uri" title="wikilink">students</a>, <a href="apprentices" class="uri" title="wikilink">apprentices</a> and/or the <a href="unemployed" class="uri" title="wikilink">unemployed</a>.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p>Since the publication of the <em><a href="History_of_Trade_Unionism" title="wikilink">History of Trade Unionism</a></em> (1894) by <a href="Sidney_Webb" title="wikilink">Sidney</a> and <a href="Beatrice_Webb" title="wikilink">Beatrice Webb</a>, the predominant historical view is that a trade union &quot;is a continuous association of wage earners for the purpose of maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <a href="Karl_Marx" title="wikilink">Karl Marx</a> described trade unions thus; - &lt;U+201C&gt;...the value of labour-power constitutes the conscious and explicit foundation of the trade unions, whose importance for the [&lt;U+2026&gt;] working class can scarcely be overestimated. The trade unions aim at nothing less than to prevent the reduction of wages below the level that is traditionally maintained in the various branches of industry. That is to say, they wish to prevent the price of labour-power from falling below its value&lt;U+201D&gt; (Capital V1, 1867, p.Â 1069).</p>
<p>A modern definition by the Australian Bureau of Statistics states that a trade union is &quot;an organization consisting predominantly of employees, the principal activities of which include the negotiation of rates of pay and conditions of employment for its members.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Yet historian R.A. Leeson, in <em>United we Stand</em> (1971), said: </p>
<p>Recent historical research by Bob James in <em>Craft, Trade or Mystery</em> (2001) puts forward the view that trade unions are part of a broader movement of <a href="benefit_society" title="wikilink">benefit societies</a>, which includes medieval guilds, <a href="Freemasonry" title="wikilink">Freemasons</a>, <a href="independent_Order_of_Odd_Fellows" title="wikilink">Oddfellows</a>, <a href="Friendly_Society" title="wikilink">friendly societies</a>, and other <a href="fraternal_organisation" title="wikilink">fraternal organizations</a>.</p>
<p>The 18th century <a href="economist" class="uri" title="wikilink">economist</a> <a href="Adam_Smith" title="wikilink">Adam Smith</a> noted the imbalance in the rights of workers in regards to owners (or &quot;masters&quot;). In <em><a href="The_Wealth_of_Nations" title="wikilink">The Wealth of Nations</a></em>, <a href="s:Chapter_8:_Of_the_Wages_of_Labour" title="wikilink">Book I, chapter 8</a>, Smith wrote:</p>

<p>As Smith noted, unions were illegal for many years in most countries, although Smith argued that it should remain illegal to fix wages or prices by employees or employers. There were severe penalties for attempting to organize unions, up to and including execution. Despite this, unions were formed and began to acquire <a href="political_power" title="wikilink">political power</a>, eventually resulting in a body of labour law that not only legalized organizing efforts, but codified the relationship between employers and those employees organized into unions.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><img src="Luddite.jpg" title="fig:Early 19th century workplace militancy manifested in the Luddite riots, when unemployed workers destroyed labour saving machines" alt="Early 19th century workplace militancy manifested in the Luddite riots, when unemployed workers destroyed labour saving machines" /> The origins of trade unions can be traced back to 18th century Britain, where the <a href="Industrial_revolution" title="wikilink">rapid expansion of industrial society</a> then taking place, drew women, children, rural workers, and immigrants into the work force in large numbers and in new roles. This pool of unskilled and semi-skilled labour spontaneously organized in fits and starts throughout its beginnings,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and would later be an important arena for the development of trade unions. Trade unions have sometimes been seen as successors to the <a href="guild" title="wikilink">guilds</a> of <a href="medieval_Europe" title="wikilink">medieval Europe</a>, though the relationship between the two is disputed, as the masters of the guilds employed workers (apprentices and journeyman) who were not allowed to organize.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Trade unions and collective bargaining were outlawed from no later than the middle of the 14th century when the <a href="Ordinance_of_Labourers" title="wikilink">Ordinance of Labourers</a> was enacted in the <a href="Kingdom_of_England" title="wikilink">Kingdom of England</a>. As collective bargaining and early worker unions grew with the onset of the <a href="Industrial_Revolution" title="wikilink">Industrial Revolution</a>, the government began to clamp down on what it saw as the danger of popular unrest at the time of <a href="Napoleonic_Wars" title="wikilink">war</a>. In 1799, the <a href="Combination_Act" title="wikilink">Combination Act</a> was passed, which banned trade unions and collective bargaining by British workers. Although the unions were subject to often severe repression until 1824, they were already widespread in cities such as <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>. Workplace militancy had also manifested itself as <a href="Luddism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luddism</a> and had been prominent in struggles such as the <a href="1820_Rising" title="wikilink">1820 Rising</a> in <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>, in which 60,000 workers went on a <a href="general_strike" title="wikilink">general strike</a>, which was soon crushed. Sympathy for the plight of the workers brought repeal of the acts in 1824, although the <a href="Combination_Act_1825" title="wikilink">Combination Act 1825</a> severely restricted their activity.</p>
<p>By the 1810s, the first labour organizations to bring together workers of divergent occupations were formed. Possibly the first such union was the General Union of Trades, also known as the Philanthropic Society, founded in 1818 in <a href="Manchester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manchester</a>. The latter name was to hide the organization's real purpose in a time when trade unions were still illegal.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="national-general-unions">National general unions</h3>
<p><img src="London_Trades_Demonstration.jpg" title="fig:Poster issued by the London Trades Council, advertising a demonstration held on June 2, 1873" alt="Poster issued by the London Trades Council, advertising a demonstration held on June 2, 1873" /> The first attempts at setting up a national <a href="general_union" title="wikilink">general union</a> were made in the 1820s and 30s; the <a href="National_Association_for_the_Protection_of_Labour" title="wikilink">National Association for the Protection of Labour</a> was established in 1830 by <a href="John_Doherty_(trade_unionist)" title="wikilink">John Doherty</a>, after an apparently unsuccessful attempt to create a similar national presence with the <a href="National_Union_of_Cotton-spinners" title="wikilink">National Union of Cotton-spinners</a>. The Association quickly enrolled approximately 150 unions, consisting mostly of textile related unions, but also including mechanics, blacksmiths, and various others. Membership rose to between 10,000 and 20,000 individuals spread across the five counties of <a href="Lancashire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lancashire</a>, <a href="Cheshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cheshire</a>, <a href="Derby" class="uri" title="wikilink">Derby</a>, <a href="Nottingham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nottingham</a>, and <a href="Leicester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leicester</a> within a year. To establish awareness and legitimacy, the union started the weekly <em><a href="Voice_of_the_People" title="wikilink">Voice of the People</a></em> publication, having the declared intention &quot;to unite the productive classes of the community in one common bond of union.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1834, the <a href="socialism" title="wikilink">socialist</a> <a href="Robert_Owen" title="wikilink">Robert Owen</a> established the <a href="Grand_National_Consolidated_Trades_Union" title="wikilink">Grand National Consolidated Trades Union</a>. The organisation attracted a range of socialists from Owenites to revolutionaries and played a part in the protests after the <a href="Tolpuddle_Martyrs" title="wikilink">Tolpuddle Martyrs</a>' case, but soon collapsed.</p>
<p>More permanent trade unions were established from the 1850s, better resourced but often less radical. The <a href="London_Trades_Council" title="wikilink">London Trades Council</a> was founded in 1860, and the <a href="Sheffield_Outrages" title="wikilink">Sheffield Outrages</a> spurred the establishment of the <a href="Trades_Union_Congress" title="wikilink">Trades Union Congress</a> in 1868, the first long-lived <a href="national_trade_union_center" title="wikilink">national trade union center</a>. By this time, the existence and the demands of the trade unions were becoming accepted by <a href="liberalism" title="wikilink">liberal</a> <a href="middle-class" class="uri" title="wikilink">middle-class</a> opinion. In <em><a href="Principles_of_Political_Economy" title="wikilink">Principles of Political Economy</a></em> (1871) <a href="John_Stuart_Mill" title="wikilink">John Stuart Mill</a> wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If it were possible for the working classes, by combining among themselves, to raise or keep up the general rate of wages, it needs hardly be said that this would be a thing not to be punished, but to be welcomed and rejoiced at. Unfortunately the effect is quite beyond attainment by such means. The multitudes who compose the working class are too numerous and too widely scattered to combine at all, much more to combine effectually. If they could do so, they might doubtless succeed in diminishing the hours of labour, and obtaining the same wages for less work. They would also have a limited power of obtaining, by combination, an increase of general wages at the expense of profits.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="legalisation-and-expansion">Legalisation and expansion</h3>
<p>Trade unions were finally legalised in 1871, after a <em><a href="Royal_Commission_on_Trade_Unions" title="wikilink">Royal Commission on Trade Unions</a></em> in 1867 agreed that the establishment of the organisations was to the advantage of both employers and employees.</p>
<p>This period also saw the growth of trade unions in other industrializing countries, especially the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, <a href="German_Empire" title="wikilink">Germany</a> and <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>.</p>
<p>In the United States, the first effective nation-wide labour organisation was the <a href="Knights_of_Labor" title="wikilink">Knights of Labor</a>, in 1869, which began to grow after 1880. Legalisation occurred slowly as a result of a series of court decisions.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The <a href="Federation_of_Organized_Trades_and_Labor_Unions" title="wikilink">Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions</a> began in 1881 as a federation of different unions that did not directly enroll workers. In 1886, it became known as the <a href="American_Federation_of_Labor" title="wikilink">American Federation of Labor</a> or AFL.</p>
<p>In Germany the <a href="Free_Association_of_German_Trade_Unions" title="wikilink">Free Association of German Trade Unions</a> was formed in 1897 after the <a href="conservativism" title="wikilink">conservative</a> <a href="Anti-Socialist_Laws" title="wikilink">Anti-Socialist Laws</a> of Chancellor <a href="Otto_von_Bismarck" title="wikilink">Otto von Bismarck</a> were repealed.</p>
<p>In <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, labour organisation was illegal until 1884. The Bourse du Travail was founded in 1887 and merged with the F&lt;U+00E9&gt;d&lt;U+00E9&gt;ration nationale des syndicats (National Federation of Trade Unions) in 1895 to form the <a href="General_Confederation_of_Labour_(France)" title="wikilink">General Confederation of Labour (France)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="united-kingdom">United Kingdom</h3>

<p>Moderate <a href="New_Model_Union" title="wikilink">New Model Unions</a> dominated the union movement from the mid-19th century and where trade unionism was stronger than the political labour movement until the formation and growth of the <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour Party</a> in the early years of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Trade unionism in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> was a major factor in economic crises during the 1960s and in particular the 1970s, culminating in the <a href="Winter_of_Discontent" title="wikilink">Winter of Discontent</a> of late 1978 and early 1979, when a significant percentage of the nation's public sector workers went on strike. By this stage, some 12,000,000 workers in the United Kingdom were trade union members. However, the election of the <a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Conservative Party</a> led by <a href="Margaret_Thatcher" title="wikilink">Margaret Thatcher</a> at the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1979" title="wikilink">general election</a> in May 1979, at the expense of Labour's <a href="James_Callaghan" title="wikilink">James Callaghan</a>, saw substantial trade union reform which saw the level of strikes fall. The level of trade union membership also fell sharply in the 1980s, and continued falling for most of the 1990s. The long decline of most of the industries in which manual trade unions were strongÂ â e.g. steel, coal, printing, the docksÂ â was one of the causes of this loss of trade union members.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2011 there were 6,135,126 members in TUC-affiliated unions, down from a peak of 12,172,508 in 1980. Trade union density was 14.1% in the private sector and 56.5% in the public sector.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="germany">Germany</h3>

<p>Trade unions in Germany have a history reaching back to the <a href="Revolutions_of_1848_in_the_German_states" title="wikilink">German revolution</a> in 1848, and still play an important role in the <a href="Economy_of_Germany" title="wikilink">German economy</a> and society. The most important labor organization is the <a href="German_Confederation_of_Trade_Unions" title="wikilink">German Confederation of Trade Unions</a> <em>(Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund or DGB)</em>, which represents more than 6 million people (31 December 2011) and is the umbrella association of several single trade unions for special economic sectors.</p>

<p><img src="Striking_workers_organised_in_the_Norwegian_labour_union_UNIO.JPG" title="fig:Workers on strike in Oslo, Norway, 2012" alt="Workers on strike in Oslo, Norway, 2012" width="215" /> Trade unions (Swedish: <em>Fackf&lt;U+00F6&gt;reningar</em>) has a long tradition in Scandinavian society. Beginning in the mid-1800s, trade unions today have a large impact on the nature of employment and worker's rights in many of the Nordic countries. One of the largest trade unions in Sweden is the <a href="Swedish_Confederation_of_Trade_Unions" title="wikilink">Swedish Confederation of Trade Unions</a>, (LO, <em>Landsorganisationen</em>), incorporating unions such as the Swedish Metal Worker's Union (<em>IF Metall</em> = <em>Industrifacket Metall</em>), The Swedish Electrician's Union (Svenska elektrikerf&lt;U+00F6&gt;rbundet) and the Swedish Municipality Worker's Union (<em>Svenska kommunalarbetaref&lt;U+00F6&gt;rbundet</em>).</p>
<p>Today, the highest rates of union membership are in the <a href="Scandinavia" title="wikilink">Scandinavian</a> countries. In 2010, the percentage of workers belonging to a union (or total labor union &quot;density&quot;) was 68.3% in <a href="Sweden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sweden</a> and 54.8% in <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a>, while it was 34.9% in <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> and 18.4% in <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Excluding full-time students working part-time, Swedish union density was 70% in 2011, 2012 and 2013.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In all the Nordic countries with a <a href="Ghent_system" title="wikilink">Ghent system</a> - Sweden, Denmark and Finland - union density is about 70%. The considerably raised fees to Swedish union unemployment funds carried out by the new centre-right government in January 2007 caused large membership losses in both unemployment funds and trade unions. From 2006 to 2008 union density declined by six percentage points: from 77% to 71%.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="united-states">United States</h3>

<p>Labor unions are legally recognized as representatives of workers in many industries in the United States. Their activity today centers on <a href="collective_bargaining" title="wikilink">collective bargaining</a> over wages, benefits, and working conditions for their membership, and on representing their members in disputes with management over violations of contract provisions. Larger unions also typically engage in lobbying activities and supporting endorsed candidates at the state and federal level.</p>
<p>Most unions in America are aligned with one of two larger umbrella organizations: the <a href="AFL-CIO" class="uri" title="wikilink">AFL-CIO</a> created in 1955, and the <a href="Change_to_Win_Federation" title="wikilink">Change to Win Federation</a> which split from the AFL-CIO in 2005. Both advocate policies and legislation on behalf of workers in the United States and Canada, and take an active role in politics. The AFL-CIO is especially concerned with global trade issues. <img src="Midnight_at_the_glassworks2.jpg" title="fig:Child laborers in an Indiana glass works. Trade unions have an objective interest in combating child labor." alt="Child laborers in an Indiana glass works. Trade unions have an objective interest in combating child labor." /></p>
<p>In 2010, the percentage of workers belonging to a union in the United States (or total labor union &quot;density&quot;) was 11.4%, compared to 18.3% in Japan, 27.5% in Canada, and 70% in Finland.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Union membership in the private sector has fallen under 7%<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> &lt;U+2013&gt; levels not seen since 1932. Unions allege that employer-incited opposition has contributed to this decline in membership. The most prominent unions are among <a href="public_sector" title="wikilink">public sector</a> employees such as teachers and police. Members of unions are disproportionately older, male and residents of the Northeast, the Midwest, and California.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Union workers average 10-30% higher pay than non-union in America after controlling for individual, job, and labor market characteristics.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

The decline in unionization since WWII in the United States has been associated with a pronounced rise in <a href="economic_inequality" title="wikilink">income and wealth inequality</a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and, since 1967, with loss of <a href="American_middle_class" title="wikilink">middle class</a> income.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="canada">Canada</h3>
<p>Labour unions have existed in Canada since the early 1800s. There is a record of skilled tradesmen in <a href="the_Maritimes" title="wikilink">the Maritimes</a> having a union organization during the War of 1812. Canadian unionism had early ties with Britain. Tradesmen who came from Britain brought traditions of the British trade union movement, and many British unions had branches in Canada. Canadian unionism ties with the United States eventually replaced those with Britain.</p>
<p>Collective bargaining was first recognized in 1937, following a strike by the <a href="United_Auto_Workers" title="wikilink">United Auto Workers</a> at the <a href="General_Motors" title="wikilink">General Motors</a>' plant in <a href="Oshawa,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Oshawa, Ontario</a>. Justice <a href="Ivan_Rand" title="wikilink">Ivan Rand</a> issued a landmark legal decision following a strike in <a href="Windsor,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Windsor, Ontario</a>, involving 17,000 <a href="Ford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ford</a> workers. He granted the union the compulsory check-off of union dues. Rand ruled that all workers in a bargaining unit benefit from a union-negotiated contract. Therefore, he reasoned they must pay union dues, although they do not have to join the union.</p>
<p>The post-<a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> era also saw an increased pattern of unionization in the public service. Teachers, nurses, social workers, professors, and cultural workers (those employed in museums, orchestras, and art galleries) all sought private-sector collective bargaining rights. In the 1970s the federal government came under intense pressures to curtail labour cost and inflation. In 1975, the Liberal government under Prime Minister Trudeau introduced mandatory price and wage controls. Under the new law, wages increases were monitored and those ruled to be unacceptably high were rolled back by the government.</p>
<p>Pressures on unions continued into the 1980s and 90s. Private sector unions faced plant closures in many manufacturing industries and demands to reduce wages and increase productivity. Public sector unions came under attack by federal and provincial governments as they attempted to reduce spending, reduce taxes and balance budgets. Legislation was introduced in many jurisdictions reversing union collective bargaining rights, and many jobs were lost to contractors.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="mexico">Mexico</h3>
<p>Before the 1990s, unions in Mexico had been historically part of a state institutional system. Between 1940, till the 1980s worldwide spread of <a href="neo-liberalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">neo-liberalism</a> through the <a href="Washington_Consensus" title="wikilink">Washington Consensus</a>, the Mexican unions did not operate independently, but instead as part of a state institutional system, largely controlled by the ruling party.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>During these 40 years, the primary aim of the labor unions was not to benefit the workers, but to carry out the state's economic policy under their cosy relationship with the ruling party. This economic policy, which peaked in the 1950 and 1960s with the so-called &quot;<a href="Mexican_Miracle" title="wikilink">Mexican Miracle</a>&quot;, saw rising incomes and improved standards of living but the primary beneficiaries were the wealthy.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1980s, Mexico began adhering to Washington Consensus policies, selling off state industries such as railroad and telecommunications to private industries. The new owners had an antagonistic attitude towards unions, which, accustomed to comfortable relationships with the state, were not prepared to fight back. A movement of new unions began to emerge under a more independent model, while the former institutionalized unions had become very corrupt, violent, and led by gangsters. From the 1990s onwards, this new model of independent unions prevailed, a number of them represented by the <a href="National_Union_of_Workers" title="wikilink">National Union of Workers</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Current old institutions like the Oil Workers Union and the <a href="National_Education_Workers&#39;_Union" title="wikilink">National Education Workers' Union</a> (<em>Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educaci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</em>, or SNTE) are examples of how the use of government benefits are not being applied to improve the quality in the investigation of the use of oil or the basic education in Mexico as long as their leaders show publicly that they are living wealthily. With 1.4 million members, the teachers' union is Latin America's largest; half of Mexico's government employees are teachers. It controls school curriculums, and all teacher appointments. Until recently, retiring teachers routinely &quot;gave&quot; their lifelong appointment to a relative or &quot;sell&quot; it for anywhere in between $4,700 and $11,800.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

These unions are often divided into &quot;<a href="Local_union" title="wikilink">locals</a>&quot;, and united in national <a href="List_of_federations_of_trade_unions" title="wikilink">federations</a>. These federations themselves will affiliate with <a href="International" title="wikilink">Internationals</a>, such as the <a href="International_Trade_Union_Confederation" title="wikilink">International Trade Union Confederation</a>. However, in <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>, union organization is slightly different due to the presence of enterprise unions, i.e. unions that are specific to a specific plant or company. These enterprise unions, however, join industry-wide federations which in turn are members of <a href="RENGO" title="wikilink">Rengo</a>, the Japanese national trade union confederation.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>In Western Europe, professional associations often carry out the functions of a trade union. In these cases, they may be negotiating for white-collar and/or professional workers, such as physicians, engineers, or teachers. Typically such trade unions refrain from politics or pursue a more liberal politics than their blue-collar counterparts.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>A <strong>union</strong> may acquire the status of a &quot;<a href="juristic_person" title="wikilink">juristic person</a>&quot; (an artificial legal entity), with a mandate to negotiate with employers for the workers it represents. In such cases, unions have certain legal rights, most importantly the right to engage in <a href="collective_bargaining" title="wikilink">collective bargaining</a> with the employer (or employers) over wages, working hours, and other <a href="employment_contract" title="wikilink">terms and conditions of employment</a>. The inability of the parties to reach an agreement may lead to <a href="industrial_action" title="wikilink">industrial action</a>, culminating in either <a href="strike_action" title="wikilink">strike action</a> or management <a href="Lockout_(industry)" title="wikilink">lockout</a>, or binding arbitration. In extreme cases, violent or illegal activities may develop around these events.</p>
<p><img src="Great_Railway_Strike_1886_-_E_St_Louis.jpg" title="fig:The Great Southwest Railroad Strike of 1886 was a trade union strike involving more than 200,000 workers" alt="The Great Southwest Railroad Strike of 1886 was a trade union strike involving more than 200,000 workers" width="250" /> In other circumstances, unions may not have the legal right to represent workers, or the right may be in question. This lack of status can range from non-recognition of a union to political or criminal prosecution of union activists and members, with many cases of violence and deaths having been recorded both historically and contemporarily.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>Unions may also engage in broader political or social struggle. <a href="Social_Movement_Unionism" title="wikilink">Social Unionism</a> encompasses many unions that use their organizational strength to advocate for social policies and legislation favourable to their members or to workers in general. As well, unions in some countries are closely aligned with <a href="political_party" title="wikilink">political parties</a>.</p>
<p>Unions are also delineated by the <a href="service_model" title="wikilink">service model</a> and the <a href="organising_model" title="wikilink">organizing model</a>. The service model union focuses more on maintaining worker rights, providing services, and resolving disputes. Alternately, the organizing model typically involves full-time <a href="union_organizer" title="wikilink">union organizers</a>, who work by building up confidence, strong networks, and leaders within the workforce; and confrontational campaigns involving large numbers of union members. Many unions are a blend of these two philosophies, and the definitions of the models themselves are still debated.</p>
<p>In Britain, the perceived left-leaning nature of trade unions has resulted in the formation of a reactionary right-wing trade union called <a href="Solidarity&amp;nbsp;&lt;U+2013&gt;_The_Union_for_British_Workers" title="wikilink">Solidarity</a> which is supported by the far-right <a href="British_National_Party" title="wikilink">BNP</a>. In Denmark, there are some newer apolitical &quot;discount&quot; unions who offer a very basic level of services, as opposed to the dominating Danish pattern of extensive services and organizing.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> <img src="UnisonStrikeRallyOxford20060328_KaihsuTai.jpg" title="fig:A rally of the trade union UNISON in Oxford during a strike on 2006-03-28." alt="A rally of the trade union UNISON in Oxford during a strike on 2006-03-28." /> In contrast, in several European countries (e.g. <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a>, <a href="Denmark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Denmark</a>, the <a href="Netherlands" class="uri" title="wikilink">Netherlands</a>, and <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a>), religious unions have existed for decades. These unions typically distanced themselves from some of the doctrines of orthodox Marxism, such as the preference of atheism and from rhetoric suggesting that employees' interests always are in conflict with those of employers. Some of these Christian unions have had some ties to centrist or conservative political movements and some do not regard strikes as acceptable political means for achieving employees' goals.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> In Poland, the biggest trade union <a href="Solidarity_(Polish_trade_union)" title="wikilink">Solidarity</a> emerged as an <a href="anti-communism" title="wikilink">anti-communist</a> movement with <a href="religious_nationalism" title="wikilink">religious nationalist</a> overtones<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> and today it supports the right-wing <a href="Law_and_Justice" title="wikilink">Law and Justice</a> party.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>Although their political structure and autonomy varies widely, union leaderships are usually formed through democratic <a href="election" title="wikilink">elections</a>. Some research, such as that conducted by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training,<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> argues that unionized workers enjoy better conditions and wages than those who are not unionized.</p>
<h2 id="shop-types">Shop types</h2>
<p>Companies that employ workers with a union generally operate on one of several models:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong><a href="closed_shop" title="wikilink">closed shop</a></strong> (US) or a &quot;pre-entry closed shop&quot; (UK) employs only people who are already union members. The compulsory <a href="hiring_hall" title="wikilink">hiring hall</a> is an example of a closed shop &lt;U+2013&gt; in this case the employer must recruit directly from the union, as well as the employee working strictly for unionized employers.</li>
<li>A <strong><a href="union_shop" title="wikilink">union shop</a></strong> (US) or a &quot;post-entry closed shop&quot; (UK) employs non-union workers as well, but sets a time limit within which new employees must join a union.</li>
<li>An <strong><a href="agency_shop" title="wikilink">agency shop</a></strong> requires non-union workers to pay a fee to the union for its services in negotiating their contract. This is sometimes called the <a href="Rand_formula" title="wikilink">Rand formula</a>. In certain situations involving state public employees in the United States, such as <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>, &quot;fair share laws&quot; make it easy to require these sorts of payments.</li>
<li>An <strong><a href="open_shop" title="wikilink">open shop</a></strong> does not require union membership in employing or keeping workers. Where a union is active, workers who do not contribute to a union may include those who approve of the union contract (<a href="free_riders" title="wikilink">free riders</a>) and those who don't. In the United States, state level <a href="right-to-work_law" title="wikilink">right-to-work laws</a> mandate the open shop in some states. In Germany only open shops are legal; that is, all discrimination based on union membership is forbidden. This affects the function and services of the union.</li>
</ul>
<p>An EU case concerning Italy stated that, &quot;The principle of trade union freedom in the Italian system implies recognition of the right of the individual not to belong to any trade union (&quot;negative&quot; freedom of association/trade union freedom), and the unlawfulness of discrimination liable to cause harm to non-unionized employees.&quot;<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>In Britain, previous to this EU jurisprudence, a series of laws introduced during the 1980s by Margaret Thatcher's government restricted closed and union shops. All agreements requiring a worker to join a union are now illegal. In the United States, the <a href="Taft-Hartley_Act" title="wikilink">Taft-Hartley Act</a> of 1947 outlawed the closed shop.</p>
<p>In 2006 the European Court of Human Rights found Danish closed-shop agreements to be in breach of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. It was stressed that Denmark and Iceland were among a limited number of contracting states that continue to permit the conclusion of closed-shop agreements.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="diversity-of-international-unions">Diversity of international unions</h2>
<p>Union law varies from country to country, as does the function of unions. For example, German and Dutch unions have played a greater role in management decisions through participation in corporate boards and <a href="co-determination" class="uri" title="wikilink">co-determination</a> than have unions in the United States.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Moreover, in the United States, collective bargaining is most commonly undertaken by unions directly with employers, whereas in Austria, Denmark, Germany, or Sweden, unions most often negotiate with employers associations.</p>
<p>Concerning labour market regulation in the EU, Gold (1993)<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> and Hall (1994)<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> have identified three distinct systems of labour market regulation, which also influence the role that unions play:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;U+201C&gt;In the <strong>Continental European System</strong> of labour market regulation, the government plays an important role as there is a strong legislative core of employee rights, which provides the basis for agreements as well as a framework for discord between unions on one side and employers or employers&lt;U+2019&gt; associations on the other. This model was said to be found in EU core countries such as Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, and it is also mirrored and emulated to some extent in the institutions of the EU, due to the relative weight that these countries had in the EU until the EU expansion by the inclusion of 10 new Eastern European member states in 2004.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Anglo-Saxon System</strong> of labour market regulation, the government&lt;U+2019&gt;s legislative role is much more limited, which allows for more issues to be decided between employers and employees and any union and/or employers&lt;U+2019&gt; associations which might represent these parties in the decision-making process. However, in these countries, collective agreements are not widespread; only a few businesses and a few sectors of the economy have a strong tradition of finding collective solutions in labour relations. Ireland and the UK belong to this category, and in contrast to the EU core countries above, these countries first joined the EU in 1973.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Nordic System</strong> of labour market regulation, the government&lt;U+2019&gt;s legislative role is limited in the same way as in the Anglo-Saxon system. However, in contrast to the countries in the Anglo-Saxon system category, this is a much more widespread network of collective agreements, which covers most industries and most firms. This model was said to encompass Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Here, Denmark joined the EU in 1973, whereas Finland and Sweden joined in 1995.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The United States takes a more <a href="laissez-faire" class="uri" title="wikilink">laissez-faire</a> approach, setting some minimum standards but leaving most workers' wages and benefits to collective bargaining and market forces. Thus it comes closest to the above <strong>Anglo-Saxon</strong> model. Also the Eastern European countries that have recently entered into the EU come closest to the <strong>Anglo-Saxon</strong> model.</p>
<p>In contrast, in Germany, the relation between individual employees and employers is considered to be asymmetrical. In consequence, many working conditions are not negotiable due to a strong legal protection of individuals. However, the German flavour or works legislation has as its main objective to create a balance of power between employees organized in unions and employers organized in employers associations. This allows much wider legal boundaries for collective bargaining, compared to the narrow boundaries for individual negotiations. As a condition to obtain the legal status of a trade union, employee associations need to prove that their leverage is strong enough to serve as a counterforce in negotiations with employers. If such an employees association is competing against another union, its leverage may be questioned by unions and then evaluated in a court trial. In Germany, only very few professional associations obtained the right to negotiate salaries and working conditions for their members, notably the medical doctors association Marburger Bund and the pilots association Vereinigung Cockpit. The engineers association <a href="Verein_Deutscher_Ingenieure" title="wikilink">Verein Deutscher Ingenieure</a> does not strive to act as a union, as it also represents the interests of engineering businesses.</p>
<p>Beyond the classification listed above, unions' relations with political parties vary. In many countries unions are tightly bonded, or even share leadership, with a political party intended to represent the interests of the working class. Typically this is a <a href="left-wing" class="uri" title="wikilink">left-wing</a>, <a href="socialist" class="uri" title="wikilink">socialist</a>, or <a href="social_democrat" title="wikilink">social democratic</a> party, but many exceptions exist, including some of the aforementioned Christian unions.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> In the United States, trade unions are almost always aligned with the <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic Party</a> with a few exceptions. For example, the <a href="International_Brotherhood_of_Teamsters" title="wikilink">International Brotherhood of Teamsters</a> has supported <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican Party</a> candidates on a number of occasions and the <a href="Professional_Air_Traffic_Controllers_Organization_(1968)" title="wikilink">Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization</a> (PATCO) endorsed <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Ronald Reagan</a> in 1980. In Britain tade union movement's relationship with the <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour Party</a> frayed as party leadership embarked on <a href="privatisation" class="uri" title="wikilink">privatisation</a> plans at odds with what unions see as the worker's interests. However, it has strengthened once more after the Labour party's election of Ed Miliband who beat his brother David Miliband, to become leader of the party after Ed secured the trade union votes. Additionally, in the past, there was a group known as the <a href="Conservative_Trade_Unionists" title="wikilink">Conservative Trade Unionists</a> or CTU. A group formed of people who sympathized with right wing Tory policy but were Trade Unionists.</p>
<p>Historically, the <a href="Republic_of_Korea" title="wikilink">Republic of Korea</a> has regulated collective bargaining by requiring employers to participate, but collective bargaining has only been legal if held in sessions before the <a href="Korean_New_Year" title="wikilink">lunar new year</a>.</p>
<h2 id="international-unionisation">International unionisation</h2>
<p>The largest trade union federation in the world is the <a href="Brussels" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brussels</a>-based <a href="International_Trade_Union_Confederation" title="wikilink">International Trade Union Confederation</a> (ITUC), which has approximately 309 affiliated organizations in 156 countries and territories, with a combined membership of 166 million. The ITUC is a federation of national trade union centres, such as the AFL-CIO in the United States and the Trades Union Congress in the United Kingdom.

<h2 id="criticisms">Criticisms</h2>

<p>Trade unions have been accused of benefiting insider workers, those having secure jobs, at the cost of outsider workers, consumers of the goods or services produced, and the shareholders of the unionized business.</p>
<p>In the United States, the outsourcing of labour to Asia, Latin America, and Africa has been partially driven by increasing costs of union partnership, which gives other countries a <a href="comparative_advantage" title="wikilink">comparative advantage</a> in labour, making it more profitable to purchase disorganised, low-wage labour from these countries.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> <a href="Milton_Friedman" title="wikilink">Milton Friedman</a>, <a href="economist" class="uri" title="wikilink">economist</a> and advocate of <a href="laissez-faire" class="uri" title="wikilink">laissez-faire</a> <a href="capitalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">capitalism</a>, sought to show that unionisation produces higher wages (for the union members) at the expense of fewer jobs, and that, if some industries are unionized while others are not, wages will tend to decline in non-unionized industries.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
