<p><strong>Major depressive disorder</strong> (also known as <strong>clinical depression</strong>, <strong>major depression</strong>, <strong>unipolar depression</strong>, or <strong>unipolar disorder</strong>) is a <a href="mental_disorder" title="wikilink">mental disorder</a> characterized by a pervasive <a href="depression_(mood)" title="wikilink">low mood</a>, low <a href="self-esteem" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-esteem</a>, and <a href="anhedonia" title="wikilink">loss of interest or pleasure</a> in normally enjoyable activities. The term &quot;major depressive disorder&quot; was selected by the <a href="American_Psychiatric_Association" title="wikilink">American Psychiatric Association</a> for this <a href="syndrome" title="wikilink">symptom cluster</a> under <a href="mood_disorder" title="wikilink">mood disorders</a> in the 1980 version of the <em><a href="Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders" title="wikilink">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a></em> (DSM-III) classification, and has become widely used since. The general term <strong>depression</strong> is often used to describe the disorder, but as it is also used to describe a <a href="depression_(mood)" title="wikilink">depressed mood</a>, more precise terminology is preferred in clinical and research use. Major depression is a disabling condition which adversely affects a person's family, work or school life, sleeping and eating habits, and general health. In the United States, approximately 3.4% of people with major depression commit <a href="suicide" class="uri" title="wikilink">suicide</a>, and up to 60% of all people who commit suicide have depression or another mood disorder.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of major depressive disorder is based on the patient's self-reported experiences, behavior reported by relatives or friends, and a <a href="Mental_status_examination" title="wikilink">mental status exam</a>. There is no laboratory test for major depression, although physicians generally request tests for physical conditions that may cause similar symptoms. The most common time of onset is between the ages of 30 and 40 years, with a later peak between 50 and 60 years. Major depression is reported about twice as frequently in women as in men, although men are at higher risk for suicide.</p>
<p>Most patients are treated in the community with <a href="antidepressant" class="uri" title="wikilink">antidepressant</a> medication and some with <a href="psychotherapy" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychotherapy</a> or counseling. Hospitalization may be necessary in cases with associated <a href="self-neglect" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-neglect</a> or a significant risk of harm to self or others. A minority are treated with <a href="electroconvulsive_therapy" title="wikilink">electroconvulsive therapy</a> (ECT), under a short-acting <a href="general_anaesthetic" title="wikilink">general anaesthetic</a>. The course of the disorder varies widely, from one episode lasting months to a lifelong disorder with recurrent <a href="major_depressive_episode" title="wikilink">major depressive episodes</a>. Depressed individuals have shorter <a href="Life_expectancy" title="wikilink">life expectancies</a> than those without depression, in part because of greater susceptibility to medical illnesses. Current and former patients may be <a href="Social_stigma" title="wikilink">stigmatized</a>.</p>
<p>The understanding of the nature and causes of depression has evolved over the centuries, though many aspects of depression remain incompletely understood and are the subject of discussion and research. <a href="psychology" title="wikilink">Psychological</a>, <a href="Social_psychology" title="wikilink">psycho-social</a>, <a href="evolution" title="wikilink">evolutionary</a> and <a href="biology" title="wikilink">biological</a> causes have been proposed. Psychological treatments are based on theories of personality, interpersonal communication, and <a href="learning_theory" title="wikilink">learning theory</a>. Most biological theories focus on the <a href="monoamine_neurotransmitter" title="wikilink">monoamine</a> chemicals <a href="serotonin" class="uri" title="wikilink">serotonin</a>, <a href="norepinephrine" class="uri" title="wikilink">norepinephrine</a>, and <a href="dopamine" class="uri" title="wikilink">dopamine</a> that are naturally present in the <a href="Human_brain" title="wikilink">brain</a> and assist communication between <a href="Neuron" title="wikilink">nerve cells</a>. Monoamines have been implicated in depression, and most antidepressants work to increase the active levels of at least one.</p>
<h2 id="symptoms-and-signs">Symptoms and signs</h2>
<p>Major depression is a serious illness that affects a person's family, work or school life, sleeping and eating habits, and general health.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Its impact on functioning and well-being has been equated to that of chronic medical conditions such as <a href="Diabetes_mellitus" title="wikilink">diabetes</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>A person suffering a <a href="major_depressive_episode" title="wikilink">major depressive episode</a> usually exhibits a very low mood pervading all aspects of life and <a href="anhedonia" title="wikilink">an inability to experience pleasure</a> in previously enjoyable activities.

<h2 id="causes">Causes</h2>
<p>The <a href="biopsychosocial_model" title="wikilink">biopsychosocial model</a> proposes that biological, psychological, and social factors all play a role to varying degrees in causing depression.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The <a href="diathesis&lt;U+2013&gt;stress_model" title="wikilink">diathesis&lt;U+2013&gt;stress model</a> posits that depression results when a preexisting vulnerability, or diathesis, is activated by stressful life events. The preexisting vulnerability can be either <a href="gene" title="wikilink">genetic</a>,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> implying an interaction between <a href="Nature_versus_nurture" title="wikilink">nature and nurture</a>, or <a href="Schema_(psychology)" title="wikilink">schematic</a>, resulting from views of the world learned in childhood.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> These interactive models have gained <a href="empirical" class="uri" title="wikilink">empirical</a> support.

<h4 id="monoamine-hypothesis">Monoamine hypothesis</h4>
<p>Most <a href="antidepressant" title="wikilink">antidepressants</a> increase <a href="Chemical_synapse" title="wikilink">synaptic</a> levels of serotonin, one of a group of <a href="neurotransmitter" title="wikilink">neurotransmitters</a> known as monoamines. Serotonin is hypothesized to help regulate other neurotransmitter systems; decreased serotonin activity may allow these systems to act in unusual and erratic ways.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> According to this &quot;permissive hypothesis&quot;, depression arises when low serotonin levels promote low levels of norepinephrine, another monoamine neurotransmitter.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Some antidepressants enhance the levels of norepinephrine directly, whereas others raise the levels of dopamine, a third monoamine neurotransmitter. These observations gave rise to the <a href="monoamine_hypothesis" title="wikilink">monoamine hypothesis</a> of depression. In its contemporary formulation, the monoamine hypothesis postulates that a deficiency of certain neurotransmitters is responsible for the corresponding features of depression: &quot;Norepinephrine may be related to alertness and energy as well as anxiety, attention, and interest in life; [lack of] serotonin to anxiety, obsessions, and compulsions; and dopamine to attention, motivation, pleasure, and reward, as well as interest in life.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The proponents of this theory recommend the choice of an antidepressant with mechanism of action that impacts the most prominent symptoms. Anxious and irritable patients should be treated with SSRIs or <a href="norepinephrine_reuptake_inhibitor" title="wikilink">norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors</a>, and those experiencing a loss of energy and enjoyment of life with norepinephrine and dopamine enhancing drugs.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> <img src="Synapse_Illustration2_tweaked.svg" title="fig:Schematic of a synapse between an axon of one neuron and a dendrite of another.

Antidepressants influence the overall balance of these processes." alt="Schematic of a synapse between an axon of one neuron and a dendrite of another. Synapses are specialized gaps between neurons.

<p>In the past two decades, research has revealed multiple limitations of the monoamine hypothesis, and its explanatory inadequacy has been criticized within the psychiatric community.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Intensive investigation has failed to find convincing evidence of a primary dysfunction of a specific monoamine system in patients with major depressive disorders. The medications <a href="tianeptine" class="uri" title="wikilink">tianeptine</a> and <a href="opipramol" class="uri" title="wikilink">opipramol</a> have long been known to have antidepressant properties despite lacking any effect on the monoamine system. Experiments with pharmacological agents that cause depletion of monoamines have shown that this depletion does not cause depression in healthy people nor does it worsen symptoms in depressed patients&lt;U+2014&gt;although an intact monoamine system is necessary for antidepressants to achieve therapeutic effectiveness.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> According to an essay published by the <a href="Public_Library_of_Science" title="wikilink">Public Library of Science</a> (PLoS), the monoamine hypothesis, already limited, has been further oversimplified when presented to the general public.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="other-theories">Other theories</h4>
<p><a href="MRI" class="uri" title="wikilink">MRI</a> scans of patients with depression have reported a number of differences in brain structure compared to those without the illness. Although there is some inconsistency in the results, <a href="meta-analyses" class="uri" title="wikilink">meta-analyses</a> have shown there is strong evidence for smaller <a href="hippocampus" title="wikilink">hippocampal</a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> volumes and increased numbers of <a href="hyperintensities" title="wikilink">hyperintensive lesions</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Hyperintensities have been associated with patients with a late age of onset, and have led to the development of the theory of <a href="Subcortical_ischemic_depression" title="wikilink">vascular depression</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>There may be a link between depression and <a href="neurogenesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">neurogenesis</a> of the <a href="hippocampus" class="uri" title="wikilink">hippocampus</a>,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> a center for both mood and memory. Loss of hippocampal <a href="neuron" title="wikilink">neurons</a> is found in some depressed individuals and correlates with impaired memory and dysthymic mood. Drugs may increase serotonin levels in the brain, stimulating neurogenesis and thus increasing the total mass of the hippocampus. This increase may help to restore mood and memory.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Similar relationships have been observed between depression and an area of the <a href="anterior_cingulate_cortex" title="wikilink">anterior cingulate cortex</a> implicated in the modulation of emotional behavior.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> One of the <a href="neurotrophin" title="wikilink">neurotrophins</a> responsible for neurogenesis is the <a href="brain-derived_neurotrophic_factor" title="wikilink">brain-derived neurotrophic factor</a> (BDNF). The level of BDNF in the blood plasma of depressed subjects is drastically reduced (more than threefold) as compared to the norm. Antidepressant treatment increases the blood level of BDNF. Although decreased plasma BDNF levels have been found in many other disorders, there is some evidence that BDNF is involved in the cause of depression and the mechanism of action of antidepressants.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Major depression may also be caused in part by an overactive <a href="hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal_axis" title="wikilink">hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis</a> (HPA axis) that is similar to the neuro-endocrine response to stress. Investigations reveal increased levels of the hormone <a href="cortisol" class="uri" title="wikilink">cortisol</a> and enlarged pituitary and adrenal glands, suggesting disturbances of the <a href="endocrine_system" title="wikilink">endocrine system</a> may play a role in some psychiatric disorders, including major depression. Oversecretion of <a href="corticotropin-releasing_hormone" title="wikilink">corticotropin-releasing hormone</a> from the <a href="hypothalamus" class="uri" title="wikilink">hypothalamus</a> is thought to drive this, and is implicated in the cognitive and arousal symptoms.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Biological_clock_human.PNG" title="fig:Depression may be related to the same brain mechanisms that control the cycles of sleep and wakefulness." alt="Depression may be related to the same brain mechanisms that control the cycles of sleep and wakefulness." width="350" /> Depression may be related to abnormalities in the <a href="circadian_rhythm" title="wikilink">circadian rhythm</a>, or biological clock. For example, the <a href="Rapid_eye_movement_(sleep)" title="wikilink">REM stage of sleep</a>, the one in which <a href="dream" title="wikilink">dreaming</a> occurs, may be quick to arrive, and intense, in depressed people. REM sleep depends on decreased serotonin levels in the <a href="brain_stem" title="wikilink">brain stem</a>,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> and is impaired by compounds, such as antidepressants, that increase serotoninergic tone in brain stem structures.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Overall, the serotonergic system is least active during sleep and most active during wakefulness. Prolonged wakefulness due to <a href="sleep_deprivation" title="wikilink">sleep deprivation</a> activates serotonergic neurons, leading to processes similar to the therapeutic effect of antidepressants, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Depressed individuals can exhibit a significant lift in mood after a night of sleep deprivation. SSRIs may directly depend on the increase of central serotonergic neurotransmission for their therapeutic effect, the same system that impacts cycles of sleep and wakefulness.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Research on the effects of <a href="light_therapy" title="wikilink">light therapy</a> on treating <a href="seasonal_affective_disorder" title="wikilink">seasonal affective disorder</a> suggests that light deprivation is related to decreased activity in the serotonergic system and to abnormalities in the sleep cycle, particularly insomnia. Exposure to light also targets the serotonergic system, providing more support for the important role this system may play in depression.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Sleep deprivation and <a href="light_therapy" title="wikilink">light therapy</a> both target the same brain neurotransmitter system and brain areas as antidepressant drugs, and are now used clinically to treat depression.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Light therapy, sleep deprivation and sleep time displacement (sleep phase advance therapy) are being used in combination quickly to interrupt a deep depression in hospitalized patients.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>The hormone <a href="estrogen" class="uri" title="wikilink">estrogen</a> has been implicated in depressive disorders due to the increase in risk of depressive episodes after puberty, the antenatal period, and reduced rates after <a href="menopause" class="uri" title="wikilink">menopause</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Conversely, the premenstrual and postpartum periods of low estrogen levels are also associated with increased risk.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The use of estrogen has been under-researched, and although some small trials show promise in its use to prevent or treat depression, the evidence for its effectiveness is not strong.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Estrogen replacement therapy has been shown to be beneficial in improving mood in <a href="Menopause#Perimenopause" title="wikilink">perimenopause</a>, but it is unclear if it is merely the menopausal symptoms that are being reversed.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Other research has explored potential roles of molecules necessary for overall <a href="Cell_(biology)" title="wikilink">cellular</a> functioning: <a href="cytokine" title="wikilink">cytokines</a> and <a href="essential_nutrient" title="wikilink">essential nutrients</a>.

<p>Various aspects of <a href="Personality_psychology" title="wikilink">personality</a> and its <a href="personality_development" title="wikilink">development</a> appear to be integral to the occurrence and persistence of depression.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Although depressive episodes are strongly correlated with adverse events, a person's characteristic style of coping may be correlated with their resilience.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Additionally, low <a href="self-esteem" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-esteem</a> and self-defeating or distorted thinking are related to depression. Depression may be less likely to occur, as well as quicker to remit, among those who are religious.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> It is not always clear which factors are causes or which are effects of depression; however, depressed persons who are able to make corrections in their thinking patterns often show improved mood and self-esteem.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>American psychiatrist <a href="Aaron_T._Beck" title="wikilink">Aaron T. Beck</a> developed what is now known as a cognitive model of depression in the early 1960s. He proposed three concepts which underlie depression: a <a href="Beck&#39;s_cognitive_triad" title="wikilink">triad</a> of negative thoughts comprising cognitive errors about oneself, one's world, and one's future; recurrent patterns of depressive thinking, or <em>schemas</em>; and <a href="cognitive_distortions" title="wikilink">distorted information processing</a>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> From these principles, he developed the structured technique of <a href="cognitive_behavioral_therapy" title="wikilink">cognitive behavioral therapy</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> According to American psychologist <a href="Martin_Seligman" title="wikilink">Martin Seligman</a>, depression in humans is similar to <a href="learned_helplessness" title="wikilink">learned helplessness</a> in laboratory animals, who remain in unpleasant situations when they are able to escape, but do not because they initially learned they had no control.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>Depressed individuals often blame themselves for negative events.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> In a study of hospitalized adolescents with self-reported depression, those who felt responsible for negative events did not take credit for positive outcomes.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> This tendency is characteristic of a depressive <a href="Attribution_(psychology)" title="wikilink">attributional</a>, or pessimistic <a href="explanatory_style" title="wikilink">explanatory style</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> According to <a href="Albert_Bandura" title="wikilink">Albert Bandura</a>, a Canadian <a href="Social_psychology_(psychology)" title="wikilink">social psychologist</a> associated with <a href="social_cognitive_theory" title="wikilink">social cognitive theory</a>, depressed individuals have negative beliefs about themselves, based on experiences of failure, observing the failure of social models, a lack of social persuasion that they can succeed, and their own somatic and emotional states including tension and stress. These influences may result in a negative <a href="self-concept" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-concept</a> and a perceived lack of <a href="self-efficacy" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-efficacy</a>; that is, they do not believe they can influence events or achieve personal goals. <a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>An examination of depression in women indicates that vulnerability factors&lt;U+2014&gt;such as early maternal loss, lack of a confiding relationship, responsibility for the care of several young children at home, and unemployment&lt;U+2014&gt;can interact with life stressors to increase the risk of depression.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> For older adults, the factors are often health problems, changes in relationships with a spouse or adult children due to the transition to a <a href="Caregiver" title="wikilink">care-giving</a> or care-needing role, the death of a significant other, or a change in the availability or quality of social relationships with older friends because of their own health-related life changes.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>The understanding of depression has also received contributions from the <a href="psychoanalysis" title="wikilink">psychoanalytic</a>, <a href="existential_psychology" title="wikilink">existential</a>, and <a href="humanistic_psychology" title="wikilink">humanistic</a> branches of psychology.

<p>The relationship between stressful life events and <a href="social_support" title="wikilink">social support</a> has been a matter of some debate; the lack of social support may increase the likelihood that life stress will lead to depression, or the absence of social support may constitute a form of strain that leads to depression directly.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> There is evidence that neighborhood social disorder, for example, due to crime or illicit drugs, is a risk factor, and that a high neighborhood socioeconomic status, with better <a href="amenities" class="uri" title="wikilink">amenities</a>, is a protective factor.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Adverse conditions at work, particularly demanding jobs with little scope for decision-making, are associated with depression, although diversity and confounding factors make it difficult to confirm that the relationship is causal.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="evolutionary">Evolutionary</h3>

<p>From the standpoint of evolutionary theory, major depression is hypothesized, in some instances, to increase an individual's <a href="Fitness_(biology)" title="wikilink">ability to reproduce</a>. <a href="Evolutionary_approaches_to_depression" title="wikilink">Evolutionary approaches to depression</a> and <a href="evolutionary_psychology" title="wikilink">evolutionary psychology</a> posit specific mechanisms by which depression may have been genetically incorporated into the human gene pool, accounting for the high heritability and prevalence of depression by proposing that certain components of depression are <a href="adaptation" title="wikilink">adaptations</a>,<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> such as the behaviors relating to <a href="attachment_theory" title="wikilink">attachment</a> and <a href="Social_class" title="wikilink">social rank</a>.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Current behaviors can be explained as adaptations to regulate relationships or resources, although the result may be maladaptive in modern environments.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>From a <a href="counseling_psychology" title="wikilink">counseling psychology</a> viewpoint, the therapist may see depression, not as a biochemical illness or disorder, but as &quot;a species-wide evolved suite of emotional programmes that are mostly activated by a perception, almost always over-negative, of a major decline in personal usefulness, that can sometimes be linked to guilt, shame or perceived rejection&quot;.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> This suite may have manifested in aging hunters in humans' <a href="foraging" class="uri" title="wikilink">foraging</a> past, who were marginalized by their declining skills, and may continue to appear in <a href="Social_alienation" title="wikilink">alienated members</a> of today's society. The feelings of uselessness generated by such marginalization could hypothetically prompt support from friends and kin. Additionally, in a manner analogous to that in which <a href="pain" title="wikilink">physical pain</a> has evolved to hinder actions that may cause further injury, &quot;<a href="suffering" title="wikilink">psychic misery</a>&quot; may have evolved to prevent hasty and maladaptive reactions to distressing situations.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h2>
<h3 id="clinical-assessment">Clinical assessment</h3>

<p>A diagnostic assessment may be conducted by a <a href="general_practitioner" title="wikilink">general practitioner</a>, <a href="Social_work" title="wikilink">licensed clinical social worker</a>, or by a <a href="psychiatrist" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychiatrist</a> or <a href="psychologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychologist</a>,<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> who will <a href="psychiatric_history" title="wikilink">record</a> the person's current circumstances, biographical history and current symptoms, and a family medical history to see if other family members have suffered from a <a href="mood_disorder" title="wikilink">mood disorder</a>, and discuss the person's alcohol and drug use. The assessment also includes a <a href="mental_state_examination" title="wikilink">mental state examination</a>, which is an assessment of the person's current mood and thought content, in particular the presence of themes of hopelessness or pessimism, <a href="self-harm" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-harm</a> or suicide, and an absence of positive thoughts or plans.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Specialist mental health services are rare in rural areas, and thus diagnosis and management is largely left to <a href="primary_care" title="wikilink">primary care</a> clinicians.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> This issue is even more marked in developing countries.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The score on a <a href="rating_scale" title="wikilink">rating scale</a> alone is not sufficient to diagnose depression, but they provide an indication of the severity of symptoms for a time period, so a person who scores above a given cut-off point can be more thoroughly evaluated for a depressive disorder diagnosis.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Several rating scales are used for this purpose.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> <a href="Screening_(medicine)" title="wikilink">Screening</a> programs have been advocated to improve detection of depression, but there is evidence that they do not improve detection rates, treatment, or outcome.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>Before diagnosing a major depressive disorder, a doctor generally performs a medical examination and selected investigations to rule out other causes of symptoms.

<h3 id="dsm-iv-tr-and-icd-10-criteria">DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 criteria</h3>
<p>The most widely used criteria for diagnosing depressive conditions are found in the <a href="American_Psychiatric_Association" title="wikilink">American Psychiatric Association</a>'s revised fourth edition of the <em><a href="Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders" title="wikilink">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a></em> (DSM-IV-TR), and the <a href="World_Health_Organization" title="wikilink">World Health Organization</a>'s <em><a href="ICD" title="wikilink">International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems</a></em> (ICD-10) which uses the name <strong>recurrent depressive disorder</strong>.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> The latter system is typically used in European countries, while the former is used in the US and many other non-European nations,<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> and the authors of both have worked towards conforming one with the other.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p>Major depressive disorder is classified as a mood disorder in DSM-IV-TR.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> The diagnosis hinges on the presence of a single or recurrent <a href="major_depressive_episode" title="wikilink">major depressive episode</a>.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Further qualifiers are used to classify both the episode itself and the course of the disorder. The category <a href="Depressive_Disorder_Not_Otherwise_Specified" title="wikilink">Depressive disorder not otherwise specified</a> is diagnosed if the depressive episode's manifestation does not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode. The <a href="ICD-10" class="uri" title="wikilink">ICD-10</a> system does not use the term <em>Major depressive disorder</em>, but lists very similar criteria for the diagnosis of a depressive episode (mild, moderate or severe); the term <em>recurrent</em> may be added if there have been multiple episodes without mania.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="major-depressive-episode">Major depressive episode</h4>

<p>A major depressive episode is characterized by the presence of a severely depressed mood that persists for at least two weeks.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Episodes may be isolated or recurrent and are categorized as mild (few symptoms in excess of minimum criteria), moderate, or severe (marked impact on social or occupational functioning). An episode with psychotic features&lt;U+2014&gt;commonly referred to as <em><a href="psychotic_depression" title="wikilink">psychotic depression</a></em>&lt;U+2014&gt;is automatically rated as severe. If the patient has had an episode of <a href="mania" class="uri" title="wikilink">mania</a> or <a href="hypomania" title="wikilink">markedly elevated mood</a>, a diagnosis of <a href="bipolar_disorder" title="wikilink">bipolar disorder</a> is made instead.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> Depression without mania is sometimes referred to as <em>unipolar</em> because the mood remains at one emotional state or &quot;pole&quot;.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p>DSM-IV-TR excludes cases where the symptoms are a result of <a href="bereavement" class="uri" title="wikilink">bereavement</a>, although it is possible for normal bereavement to evolve into a depressive episode if the mood persists and the characteristic features of a major depressive episode develop.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> The criteria have been criticized because they do not take into account any other aspects of the personal and social context in which depression can occur.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> In addition, some studies have found little empirical support for the DSM-IV cut-off criteria, indicating they are a diagnostic convention imposed on a continuum of depressive symptoms of varying severity and duration:<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> excluded are a range of related diagnoses, including <a href="dysthymia" class="uri" title="wikilink">dysthymia</a> which involves a chronic but milder mood disturbance,<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> <a href="Recurrent_brief_depression" title="wikilink">Recurrent brief depression</a> which involves briefer depressive episodes,<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a><a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> <a href="minor_depressive_disorder" title="wikilink">minor depressive disorder</a> which involves only some of the symptoms of major depression,<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> and <a href="Adjustment_disorder" title="wikilink">adjustment disorder with depressed mood</a> which involves low mood resulting from a psychological response to an identifiable event or <a href="Stress_(biological)" title="wikilink">stressor</a>.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>

<p>The DSM-IV-TR recognizes five further subtypes of MDD, called <em>specifiers</em>, in addition to noting the length, severity and presence of psychotic features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="Melancholic_depression" title="wikilink">Melancholic depression</a></strong> is characterized by a loss of pleasure in most or all activities, a failure of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli, a quality of depressed mood more pronounced than that of <a href="grief" class="uri" title="wikilink">grief</a> or loss, a worsening of symptoms in the morning hours, early morning waking, <a href="psychomotor_retardation" title="wikilink">psychomotor retardation</a>, excessive weight loss (not to be confused with <a href="anorexia_nervosa" title="wikilink">anorexia nervosa</a>), or excessive guilt.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="differential-diagnoses">Differential diagnoses</h3>
<p>To confer major depressive disorder as the most likely diagnosis, <a href="Differential_diagnosis" title="wikilink">other potential diagnoses</a> must be considered, including dysthymia, adjustment disorder with depressed mood or bipolar disorder. <a href="Dysthymia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dysthymia</a> is a chronic, milder mood disturbance in which a person reports a low mood almost daily over a span of at least two years. The symptoms are not as severe as those for major depression, although people with dysthymia are vulnerable to secondary episodes of major depression (sometimes referred to as <em>double depression</em>).<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> <a href="Adjustment_disorder" title="wikilink">Adjustment disorder with depressed mood</a> is a mood disturbance appearing as a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor, in which the resulting emotional or behavioral symptoms are significant but do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> <a href="Bipolar_disorder" title="wikilink">Bipolar disorder</a>, previously known as <em>manic-depressive disorder</em>, is a condition in which depressive phases alternate with periods of mania or <a href="hypomania" class="uri" title="wikilink">hypomania</a>.

<h2 id="treatment">Treatment</h2>

<p>The three most common treatments for depression are psychotherapy, medication, and electroconvulsive therapy. Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice for people under 18, while electroconvulsive therapy is only used as a last resort. Care is usually given on an <a href="Psychiatry#Outpatient_treatment" title="wikilink">outpatient</a> basis, while treatment in an <a href="Psychiatry#Inpatient_treatment" title="wikilink">inpatient</a> unit is considered if there is a significant risk to self or others.</p>
<p>Treatment options are much more limited in developing countries, where access to mental health staff, medication, and psychotherapy is often difficult. Development of mental health services is minimal in many countries; depression is viewed as a phenomenon of the developed world despite evidence to the contrary, and not as an inherently life-threatening condition.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="psychotherapy">Psychotherapy</h3>
<p><a href="Psychotherapy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Psychotherapy</a> can be delivered, to individuals or groups, by mental health professionals, including psychotherapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical <a href="social_work" title="wikilink">social workers</a>, counselors, and psychiatric nurses. With more complex and chronic forms of depression, a combination of medication and psychotherapy may be used.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> In children and young people under 18, medication should only be offered in conjunction with a psychological therapy, such as CBT, interpersonal therapy, or family therapy.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> Psychotherapy has been shown to be effective in older people.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a><a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> Successful psychotherapy appears to reduce the recurrence of depression even after it has been terminated or replaced by occasional booster sessions.</p>
<p>The most studied form of psychotherapy for depression is <a href="cognitive_behavioral_therapy" title="wikilink">cognitive behavioral therapy</a> (CBT), thought to work by teaching clients to learn a set of useful cognitive and behavioral skills. Earlier research suggested that CBT was not as effective as antidepressant medication; however, research in 1996 suggests that it can perform as well as antidepressants in patients with moderate to severe depression.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> Overall, evidence shows CBT to be effective in depressed adolescents,<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> although one systematic review noted there was insufficient evidence for severe episodes.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> Combining fluoxetine with CBT appeared to bring no additional benefit,<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a><a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> or, at the most, only marginal benefit.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Several variants have been used in depressed patients, most notably <a href="rational_emotive_behavior_therapy" title="wikilink">rational emotive behavior therapy</a>,<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> and more recently <a href="mindfulness-based_cognitive_therapy" title="wikilink">mindfulness-based cognitive therapy</a>.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Interpersonal_psychotherapy" title="wikilink">Interpersonal psychotherapy</a> focuses on the social and interpersonal triggers that may cause depression. There is evidence that it is an effective treatment. The therapy takes a structured course with a set number of weekly sessions (often 12), the focus is on relationships with others. Therapy can be used to help a person develop or improve <a href="interpersonal_skills" title="wikilink">interpersonal skills</a> to allow him or her to communicate more effectively and reduce stress.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
<p>Psychoanalysis, a school of thought founded by Sigmund Freud that emphasizes the resolution of unconscious mental conflicts,<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> is used by its practitioners to treat clients presenting with major depression.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> A more widely practiced, eclectic technique, called <a href="psychodynamic_psychotherapy" title="wikilink">psychodynamic psychotherapy</a>, is loosely based on psychoanalysis and has an additional social and interpersonal focus.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> In a meta-analysis of three controlled trials of Short Psychodynamic Supportive Psychotherapy, this modification was found to be as effective as medication for mild to moderate depression.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Logotherapy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Logotherapy</a>, a form of existential psychotherapy developed by Austrian psychiatrist <a href="Viktor_Frankl" title="wikilink">Viktor Frankl</a>, addresses the filling of an <a href="Emptiness" title="wikilink">&quot;existential vacuum&quot;</a> associated with feelings of futility and meaninglessness. This type of psychotherapy may be particularly useful for depressed adolescents.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="antidepressants">Antidepressants</h3>

<p>Major depressive episodes often resolve over time whether or not they are treated.

<p>Recurrence is more likely if symptoms have not fully resolved with treatment. Current guidelines recommend continuing antidepressants for four to six months after remission to prevent relapse. Evidence from many <a href="randomized_controlled_trial" title="wikilink">randomized controlled trials</a> indicates continuing antidepressant medications after recovery can reduce the chance of relapse by 70% (41% on placebo vs. 18% on antidepressant).

The newer concept abandoned these associations and, through the 19th century, became more associated with women.<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a></p>
<p>Although <em>melancholia</em> remained the dominant diagnostic term, <em>depression</em> gained increasing currency in medical treatises and was a synonym by the end of the century; German psychiatrist <a href="Emil_Kraepelin" title="wikilink">Emil Kraepelin</a> may have been the first to use it as the overarching term, referring to different kinds of melancholia as <em>depressive states</em>.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a></p>
<p>Sigmund Freud likened the state of melancholia to mourning in his 1917 paper <em>Mourning and Melancholia</em>. He theorized that <a href="object_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">objective</a> loss, such as the loss of a valued relationship through death or a romantic break-up, results in <a href="subject_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">subjective</a> loss as well; the depressed individual has identified with the object of affection through an <a href="unconscious_mind" title="wikilink">unconscious</a>, <a href="narcissism" title="wikilink">narcissistic</a> process called the <em>libidinal <a href="cathexis" class="uri" title="wikilink">cathexis</a></em> of the <a href="ego" class="uri" title="wikilink">ego</a>. Such loss results in severe melancholic symptoms more profound than mourning; not only is the outside world viewed negatively, but the ego itself is compromised.<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a> The patient's decline of self-perception is revealed in his belief of his own blame, inferiority, and unworthiness.<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> He also emphasized early life experiences as a predisposing factor.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a> Meyer put forward a mixed social and biological framework emphasizing <em>reactions</em> in the context of an individual's life, and argued that the term <em>depression</em> should be used instead of <em>melancholia</em>.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a> The first version of the DSM (DSM-I, 1952) contained <em>depressive reaction</em> and the DSM-II (1968) <em>depressive neurosis</em>, defined as an excessive reaction to internal conflict or an identifiable event, and also included a depressive type of manic-depressive psychosis within Major affective disorders.<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a></p>
<p>In the mid-20th century, researchers theorized that depression was caused by a <a href="chemical_imbalance_theory" title="wikilink">chemical imbalance</a> in neurotransmitters in the brain, a theory based on observations made in the 1950s of the effects of <a href="reserpine" class="uri" title="wikilink">reserpine</a> and <a href="isoniazid" class="uri" title="wikilink">isoniazid</a> in altering monoamine neurotransmitter levels and affecting depressive symptoms.<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a></p>
<p>The term <em>Major depressive disorder</em> was introduced by a group of US clinicians in the mid-1970s as part of proposals for diagnostic criteria based on patterns of symptoms (called the &quot;Research Diagnostic Criteria&quot;, building on earlier <a href="Feighner_Criteria" title="wikilink">Feighner Criteria</a>),<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a> and was incorporated in to the DSM-III in 1980.<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a> To maintain consistency the ICD-10 used the same criteria, with only minor alterations, but using the DSM diagnostic threshold to mark a <em>mild depressive episode</em>, adding higher threshold categories for moderate and severe episodes.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a><a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a> The ancient idea of <em>melancholia</em> still survives in the notion of a melancholic subtype.</p>
<p>The new definitions of depression were widely accepted, albeit with some conflicting findings and views. There have been some continued empirically-based arguments for a return to the diagnosis of melancholia.<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a><a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a> There has been some criticism of the expansion of coverage of the diagnosis, related to the development and promotion of antidepressants and the biological model since the late 1950s.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="sociocultural-aspects">Sociocultural aspects</h2>

<p>Even today, people's conceptualizations of depression vary widely, both within and among cultures. &quot;Because of the lack of scientific certainty,&quot; one commentator has observed, &quot;the debate over depression turns on questions of language. What we call it&lt;U+2014&gt;'disease,' 'disorder,' 'state of mind'&lt;U+2014&gt;affects how we view, diagnose, and treat it.&quot;<a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260"><sup>260</sup></a> There are cultural differences in the extent to which serious depression is considered an illness requiring personal professional treatment, or is an indicator of something else, such as the need to address social or moral problems, the result of biological imbalances, or a reflection of individual differences in the understanding of distress that may reinforce feelings of powerlessness, and emotional struggle.<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a><a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262"><sup>262</sup></a></p>
<p>The diagnosis is less common in some countries, such as <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>. It has been argued that the Chinese traditionally deny or <a href="Somatization" title="wikilink">somatize</a> emotional depression (although since the early 1980s the Chinese denial of depression may have modified drastically).<a href="#fn263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263"><sup>263</sup></a> Alternatively, it may be that Western cultures reframe and elevate some expressions of human distress to disorder status. Australian professor <a href="Gordon_Parker" title="wikilink">Gordon Parker</a> and others have argued that the Western concept of depression &quot;medicalizes&quot; sadness or misery.<a href="#fn264" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref264"><sup>264</sup></a><a href="#fn265" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref265"><sup>265</sup></a> Similarly, Hungarian-American psychiatrist <a href="Thomas_Szasz" title="wikilink">Thomas Szasz</a> and others argue that depression is a metaphorical illness that is inappropriately regarded as an actual disease.<a href="#fn266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266"><sup>266</sup></a> There has also been concern that the DSM, as well as the field of <a href="descriptive_psychiatry" title="wikilink">descriptive psychiatry</a> that employs it, tends to <a href="Reification_(fallacy)" title="wikilink">reify</a> abstract phenomena such as depression, which may in fact be <a href="Social_constructionism" title="wikilink">social constructs</a>.<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267"><sup>267</sup></a> American <a href="Archetypal_psychology" title="wikilink">archetypal psychologist</a> <a href="James_Hillman" title="wikilink">James Hillman</a> writes that depression can be healthy for the <a href="soul" class="uri" title="wikilink">soul</a>, insofar as &quot;it brings refuge, limitation, focus, gravity, weight, and humble powerlessness.&quot;<a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268"><sup>268</sup></a> Hillman argues that therapeutic attempts to eliminate depression echo the Christian theme of <a href="resurrection" class="uri" title="wikilink">resurrection</a>, but have the unfortunate effect of demonizing a soulful state of being.</p>

<p>Historical figures were often reluctant to discuss or seek treatment for depression due to <a href="social_stigma" title="wikilink">social stigma</a> about the condition, or due to ignorance of diagnosis or treatments. Nevertheless, analysis or interpretation of letters, journals, artwork, writings or statements of family and friends of some historical personalities has led to the presumption that they may have had some form of depression.
