<p><strong><em>Diary of a Camper</em></strong> is a short 1996 <a href="cinema_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">American film</a> made using <a href="id_Software" title="wikilink">id Software</a>'s 1996 <a href="first-person_shooter" title="wikilink">first-person shooter</a> <a href="video_game" title="wikilink">computer game</a> <em><a href="Quake" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quake</a></em>. It was created by <a href="United_Ranger_Films" title="wikilink">United Ranger Films</a>, then a subdivision of a popular group of computer game players, or <a href="clan_(gaming)" title="wikilink">clan</a>, known as the Rangers. The film was first released over the <a href="Internet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Internet</a> as a non-interactive <a href="game_demo" title="wikilink">game demo</a> file. The video is generally considered<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> the first known example of <a href="machinima" class="uri" title="wikilink">machinima</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;the art of using real-time, virtual 3-D environments, often <a href="game_engine" title="wikilink">game engines</a>, to create animated films. The story centers on a lone <a href="camping_(computer_gaming)" title="wikilink">camper</a> (a player waiting in a strategic location instead of seeking active battle) who faces five members of the Rangers clan in a <a href="deathmatch_(gaming)" title="wikilink">deathmatch</a>, a type of <a href="multiplayer_game" title="wikilink">multiplayer game</a> in which the goal is to kill as many opponents as possible.</p>
<p>Although players had previously recorded segments of gameplay, these were usually deathmatches or <a href="speedrun" title="wikilink">speedruns</a>, attempts to complete a <a href="level_(computer_and_video_games)" title="wikilink">map</a> as quickly as possible. <em>Diary of a Camper</em> was the first demo to contain a narrative with (text-based) dialogue, instead of merely showing gameplay. Commentators have called the work primitive, but acknowledge its importance in establishing video games as a medium for filmmaking.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
<p><em>Diary of a Camper</em> occurs entirely within the <em>Quake</em> map DM6 (&quot;The Dark Zone&quot;). After exploring some of the area, the Rangers gather and decide to send two members, Sphinx and Pyoveli, to scout a room above. Shortly after they teleport into the room, the camper waiting there kills them both, as confirmed by in-game text messages that appear on the screen. The remaining three Rangers&lt;U+2014&gt;ColdSun, ArchV, and an unidentified member&lt;U+2014&gt;realize their comrades' fate and return fire from a distance, killing the camper. Examining the <a href="gibs" title="wikilink">remains</a>, they identify their foe as <a href="John_Romero" title="wikilink">John Romero</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="precedent-and-new-ground">Precedent and new ground</h2>
<p><em>Diary of a Camper</em> built on the ability to record gameplay, which first appeared in id Software's <a href="1993_in_video_gaming" title="wikilink">1993 computer game</a> <em><a href="Doom_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Doom</a></em>. Using this feature, players could efficiently record game events, rather than the rendered video itself, and later replay them in real-time through the game engine.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <em>Doom</em>{{'}}s successor, <em>Quake</em>, offered new opportunities for both gameplay and customization,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> while preserving the demo recording ability.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In the book <em>Machinima</em>, Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd stated that multiplayer games became popular, almost a sport, and demo files of matches were recorded and studied.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <a href="Paul_Marino" title="wikilink">Paul Marino</a>, executive director of the <a href="Academy_of_Machinima_Arts_&amp;_Sciences" title="wikilink">Academy of Machinima Arts &amp; Sciences</a> (AMAS), used a different analogy: &quot;Players began to record deathmatches with a more cinematic flair.... <em>[T]he viewpoint of the player became the viewpoint of a director.</em>&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Well-known for their playing skill and their ability to program <a href="mod_(computer_gaming)" title="wikilink">game modifications</a>,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> the Rangers conceived the idea to use <em>Quake</em> for filmmaking in August 1996<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and released <em>Diary of a Camper</em> on October 26, 1996.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The group's new demo surprised the <em>Quake</em> community by exploiting the game differently. According to Henry Lowood, <em>Diary of a Camper</em> contains the action and gore of previous gameplay demos, but in the context of a simple story<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> instead of the usual deathmatch.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> A <em><a href="BusinessWeek" class="uri" title="wikilink">BusinessWeek</a></em> article compared the events of the film to those of a typical deathmatch.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Like many of its predecessors, the demo was recorded in <em>Quake</em>{{'}}s networked multiplayer deathmatch mode, but &quot;it marked the transition from sports footage to moviemaking. The players were choreographed like actors, ... delivering their lines as plain text....&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Lowood stated that &quot;<em>Diary of a Camper</em> breaks with the demo movie as documented gameplay&quot; because the spectator's perspective is independent &quot;from that of any player/actor; the movie is not 'shot' from the first-person perspective of the shooter.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Lowood called the film a &quot;transformation of competitive play to ... minimal theatrical play&quot;, emphasized through the inclusion of references to gameplay, such as the camper.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Before <em>Diary of a Camper</em>{{'}}s release, Uwe Girlich, a German doctoral candidate,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> had documented the <em>Quake</em> demo file format, in which &quot;the player coordinates and camera positions may be different&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> He added that &quot;for people with too much spare-time <em>Quake</em> can replace a full 3D modelling system&quot;.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> However, the Rangers developed <em>Diary of a Camper</em> before any demo-editing software tools had been publicly released; clan member Eric &quot;ArchV&quot; Fowler instead created his own tools to reposition the camera and to splice recorded footage.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> As with all of United Ranger Films' productions, Heath &quot;ColdSun&quot; Brown wrote the story, and Matt &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot; Van Sickler was the director.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In the release notes, Brown credits clan members Chris &quot;Sphinx&quot; Birke<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and Mute with helping Fowler with &quot;movie packaging&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Diary of a Camper</em> and the films that it inspired were initially called &quot;<em>Quake</em> movies&quot;; the term <em>machinima</em> was later coined in 1998,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> in response to the increasing use of other game engines.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> There was initial hesitance to retroactively label <em>Diary of a Camper</em> the first machinima piece; a <a href="Machinima.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">Machinima.com</a> article from January 2000 opened, &quot;It's kinda hard to pin down the first Machinima: things like the Doom speedruns, the <a href="Stunt_Island" title="wikilink">Stunt Island</a> stuff and the <a href="demoscene" title="wikilink">Demo Scene</a> all compete for the title. However, it's a lot easier to pin down the first piece of film made in a 3D game engine: Diary Of A Camper&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Marino states that the AMAS carefully defined machinima in 2002 as &quot;animated filmmaking within a real-time virtual 3-D environment&quot; to separate machinima from its creative lineage.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Separating machinima from the demoscene and earlier demo recordings, he defines <em>Diary of a Camper</em> as the first machinima work.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Lowood also contrasts the film with earlier recordings of &quot;documented gameplay&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>Despite <em>Diary of a Camper</em>{{'}}s importance in establishing machinima, commentators have criticized the film's actual content. Marino called the plot &quot;simple&quot;;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> likewise, Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd believed that &quot;it wasn't much of a story&quot;,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> and Lowood wrote that &quot;the plot offers little more than a brief sequence of inside jokes&quot;.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Among major <em>Quake</em> movie review sites,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Roger Matthews of the <em>Quake</em> Movie Library called the film &quot;not much more than a deathmatch with a camera&quot;.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> On Psyk's Popcorn Jungle, Paul Coates wrote, &quot;This movie is <em>dull</em>. It is <em>not very interesting</em>.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Stephen Lum of The Cineplex said that the film contained &quot;weird humour&quot;.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Although <em>Quake</em> movie critics found shortcomings in <em>Diary of a Camper</em>, they mentioned positive aspects, including the work's novelty; however, their final ratings varied. Matthews wrote that &quot;the camera work was very nice and never once screwed up&quot;,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> and Lum gave the film &quot;a perfect 10 for Innovation/Originality because [it] started the Quake Movie craze&quot;.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Of the major <em>Quake</em> movie review sites, only The Cineplex gave <em>Diary</em> a good rating overall, 7.5 out of 10.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Matthews and Coates rated the film 20% out of 100%<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> and 2 out of 10,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> respectively. Later, Coates updated his review, saying, &quot;I feel I overreacted at the fact that DoaC was old. It's the first <em>ever</em> Quake movie. I have to give the Rangers massive credit for that.... But, by today's standards, the rating seems to fit.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>Because of its significance, <em>Diary of a Camper</em> continues to be featured in machinima presentations. In a 2005 event at <a href="Stanford_University" title="wikilink">Stanford University</a>, the film was presented with later machinima works, such as <em><a href="Red_vs._Blue" title="wikilink">Red vs. Blue</a></em>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Likewise, the <a href="Australian_Centre_for_the_Moving_Image" title="wikilink">Australian Centre for the Moving Image</a> included it in a machinima exhibit that ended on July 16, 2006.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
