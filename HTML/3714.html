<h2 id="plot-synopsis">Plot synopsis</h2>
<p>Widely considered a landmark play, <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em> deals with a culture clash between two symbolic characters, <a href="Blanche_DuBois_(character)" title="wikilink">Blanche DuBois</a>, a pretentious, fading relic of the <a href="Old_South" title="wikilink">Old South</a>, and <a href="Stanley_Kowalski" title="wikilink">Stanley Kowalski</a>, a rising member of the industrial, urban immigrant class. The play presents <a href="Blanche_DuBois_(character)" title="wikilink">Blanche DuBois</a>, a fading but still-attractive <a href="Southern_belle" title="wikilink">Southern belle</a> whose pretensions to virtue and culture only thinly mask <a href="alcoholism" class="uri" title="wikilink">alcoholism</a> and delusions of grandeur. Her poise is an illusion she presents to shield others, but most of all herself, from her reality, and an attempt to make herself still attractive to new male suitors. Blanche arrives at the apartment of her sister <a href="Stella_Kowalski" title="wikilink">Stella Kowalski</a> in the <a href="Faubourg_Marigny" title="wikilink">Faubourg Marigny</a> of <a href="New_Orleans" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a>, on <a href="Elysian_Fields_Avenue" title="wikilink">Elysian Fields Avenue</a>; the local transportation she takes to arrive there includes a streetcar route named &quot;Desire&quot;. The steamy, urban ambiance is a shock to Blanche's nerves. Explaining that her ancestral southern plantation, Belle Reve (translated from French as &quot;Beautiful Dream&quot;, though the correct French phrase is actually Beau R&lt;U+00EA&gt;ve), in Laurel, Mississippi, has been &quot;lost&quot; due to the &quot;epic fornications&quot; of her ancestors, Blanche is welcomed with some trepidation by Stella, who fears the reaction of her husband Stanley. Here &quot;epic fornications&quot; may be interpreted as the debauchery of her ancestors which in turn caused them financial losses. Blanche explains to them how her supervisor told her she could take time off from her job as an English teacher because of her upset nerves, when in fact, she has been fired for having an affair with a 17-year-old student. This turns out not to be the only seduction she has engaged in—and, along with other problems, has left Laurel to escape. A brief marriage scarred by discovery of her spouse, Allen Grey, having a homosexual affair and his subsequent suicide has led Blanche to live in a world in which her fantasies and illusions are seamlessly mixed with her reality.</p>
<p>In contrast to both the self-effacing and deferent Stella and the pretentious refinement of Blanche, Stella's husband, <a href="Stanley_Kowalski" title="wikilink">Stanley Kowalski</a>, is a force of nature: primal, rough-hewn, brutish and sensual. He dominates Stella in every way and is physically and emotionally abusive. Stella tolerates his primal behaviour as this is part of what attracted her in the first place; their love and relationship is heavily based on powerful even animalistic sexual chemistry, something that Blanche finds impossible to understand.</p>
<p>The arrival of Blanche upsets her sister and brother-in-law's system of mutual dependence. Stella's concern for her sister's well-being emboldens Blanche to hold court in the Kowalski apartment, infuriating Stanley and leading to conflict in his relationship with his wife. Stanley's friend and Blanche's would-be suitor <a href="Harold_Mitchell_(A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_character)" title="wikilink">Mitch</a> is trampled along Blanche and Stanley's collision course. Stanley discovers Blanche's past through a co-worker who travels to Laurel frequently, and Stanley confronts Blanche with the things she has been trying to put behind her, partly out of concern that her character flaws may be damaging to the lives of those in her new home, just as they were in Laurel, and partly out of a distaste for pretense in general. However, his attempts to &quot;unmask&quot; her are predictably cruel and violent. Their final confrontation—a rape—results in Blanche's nervous breakdown. Stanley has her committed to a mental institution, and in the closing moments, Blanche utters her signature line to the kindly doctor who leads her away: &quot;Whoever you are, I have always depended on the kindness of strangers,&quot; reminding us of one of the flaws that has led her to this point--relying too heavily on the attentions of men to fulfill and rescue her.</p>
<p>The reference to the <a href="tram" title="wikilink">streetcar</a> called <em>Desire</em>—providing the aura of New Orleans geography—is symbolic. Blanche not only has to travel on a streetcar route named &quot;Desire&quot; to reach Stella's home on &quot;<a href="Elysium" title="wikilink">Elysian Fields</a>&quot; but her desire acts as an irrepressible force throughout the play—she can only hang on as her desires lead her.</p>
<p>The character of Blanche is thought to be based on Williams' sister Rose Williams who struggled with her mental health and became incapacitated after a <a href="lobotomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">lobotomy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="themes-and-motifs">Themes and motifs</h2>
<h3 id="illusion-versus-reality">Illusion versus reality</h3>
<p>A recurring theme found in <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em> is a constant conflict between reality and fantasy, actual and ideal. Blanche says &quot;I don't want realism, I want magic.&quot; This recurring theme is read most strongly in Williams' characterization of Blanche DuBois and the physical tropes that she employs in her pursuit of what is magical and idealized: the paper lampshade she employs to cover the harsh white light bulb in the living room, her chronically deceptive recounting of her last years in Belle Reve, the misleading letters she presumes to write to Shep Huntleigh, and a pronounced tendency toward excess consumption of <a href="alcoholic_beverage" title="wikilink">alcohol</a>. As one critic writes, &quot;Blanche spins a cocoon linguistically for protection.&quot; Blanche creates her own fantasy world through the characters she plays, such as the damsel, southern belle or school teacher. She wears her costumes creating a fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade to hide behind, concealing her secrets and attempting to reach her former glory, and illustrating her inability to relate to others in a &quot;normal&quot; sense.</p>
<p>Notably, Blanche's deception of others and herself is not characterized by malicious intent, but rather a heart-broken and saddened retreat to a romantic time and happier moments before disaster struck her life (her previous loved one, the refined Allan Gray, committed suicide during a Varsouviana Polka, as a reaction to Blanche's revulsion when she discovered he was homosexual, after she accidentally encountered him having sex with another man).</p>
<h3 id="abandonment-of-chivalric-codes">Abandonment of chivalric codes</h3>
<p>In most fairy tales, the ailing princess or the damsel in distress is often rescued by a heroic white knight. <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em> is characterized by the conspicuous absence of the male protagonist imbued with heroic qualities. Indeed, the polar opposite of what a literary chivalric hero might be, is represented in the leading male character of the play, Stanley Kowalski. Stanley is described by Blanche as a &quot;survivor of the <a href="Stone_Age#The_Stone_Age_in_popular_culture" title="wikilink">Stone Age</a>&quot; and is further depicted in this primitive light by numerous traits that he exhibits: uncivilized manners, demanding and forceful behavior, lack of empathy, crass selfishness, and a chauvinistic attitude towards women. The replacement of the heroic white knight by a character such as Stanley Kowalski further heightens Williams' theme of the demise of the romantic &quot;Old South.&quot;</p>

<p>Over 50 years after the play opened, the revival of <a href="Streetcars_in_New_Orleans" title="wikilink">the streetcar system</a> in <a href="New_Orleans" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a> is credited by many to the worldwide fame gained by the <a href="streetcar" title="wikilink">streetcars</a> made by the <a href="Perley_A._Thomas_Car_Works,_Inc." title="wikilink">Perley A. Thomas Car Works, Inc.</a> which were operating on the Desire route in the play, and have been carefully restored and continue to operate there in 2004 (though not on the Desire Street route.) Streetcars along the Canal Street in downtown New Orleans are up and running. Previously, the St. Charles Avenue line was in partial service due to damages sustained during <a href="Hurricane_Katrina" title="wikilink">Hurricane Katrina</a> but as of January 2008, it is in full operation. Presently, though, there is merely a bus named Desire. Plans have recently been made to revive the streetcar line and funding was allocated for the project in the <a href="United_States_Department_of_Transportation" title="wikilink">U.S. Department of Transportation</a>'s FY97 budget. However, the projected was halted prior to Hurricane Katrina and there is no word, as of yet, to when it will resume.</p>
