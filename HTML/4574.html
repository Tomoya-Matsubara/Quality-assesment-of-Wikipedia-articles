<p>Allenby began playing senior cricket for <a href="Durham_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Durham CB</a>, though he only played one game for the team and it was a further three years before he made another first-class or List A appearance. Allenby played one limited overs match during the 2005 season, and his first County Championship appearance, for his new team, <a href="Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Leicestershire</a>, a year later, though his debut saw him make little impact with either bat or ball.</p>
<p>Allenby has become a regular player in the Leicestershire middle-order, with one century at first-class level so far under his belt, achieved against <a href="Essex_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Essex</a> in his very first County Championship game.</p>
<p>In the English off-season at the start of calendar year 2007 he played one game for <a href="Western_Australia_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Western Australia</a>, having previously played for their Under-19 team between 2000 and 2002.</p>
<p>On 15 June 2008, Allenby became the first player in <a href="Twenty20_Cup" title="wikilink">Twenty20 Cup</a> history to achieve four wickets with four consecutive balls, when he removed <a href="Lancashire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Lancashire Lightning</a> players <a href="Kyle_Hogg" title="wikilink">Kyle Hogg</a>, <a href="Steven_Croft" title="wikilink">Steven Croft</a>, <a href="Dominic_Cork" title="wikilink">Dominic Cork</a> and <a href="Sajid_Mahmood" title="wikilink">Sajid Mahmood</a>. Unfortunately for Allenby, he was out for a duck in the Leicestershire innings, as his side lost the match by 37 runs.</p>
