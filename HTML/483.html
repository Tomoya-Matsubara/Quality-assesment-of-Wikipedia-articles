<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We ran into a <a href="Heinkel_He_111" title="wikilink">Heinkel He 111</a> bomber, Lieutenant Bill Church attacked from astern and the bomber dived to sea level. They exchanged fire, and when Bill pulled upwards to break off the attack, his aircraft was struck in the belly and crashed into the sea without any survivors. I had learned my first lesson in air fighting with a vengeance-never break away upwards. I therefore sat on the tail of the bomber and fired short bursts until it crashed into the sea.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
