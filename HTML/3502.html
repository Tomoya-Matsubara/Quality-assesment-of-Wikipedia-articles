<p><a href="General_(Australia)" title="wikilink">General</a> <strong>Sir John Gordon Noel Wilton</strong>,  (22 November 1910 &lt;U+2013&gt; 10 May 1981) was a senior commander in the <a href="Australian_Army" title="wikilink">Australian Army</a>. He served as <a href="Chief_of_Army_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of the General Staff</a> (CGS), the Army's highest-ranking position, from 1963 until 1966, and as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (CCOSC), forerunner of the role of Australia's <a href="Chief_of_the_Defence_Force_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of the Defence Force</a>, from 1966 until 1970. His eight-year tenure as Australia's senior Army officer covered almost the entire period of the nation's <a href="Military_history_of_Australia_during_the_Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">involvement in the Vietnam War</a>.</p>
<p>Born in <a href="Sydney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sydney</a>, Wilton entered the <a href="Royal_Military_College,_Duntroon" title="wikilink">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, in 1927. Owing to lack of opportunity in the Australian military at the time, he was commissioned into the <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a> following his graduation in 1930. He served most of the remainder of the decade with the <a href="Royal_Artillery" title="wikilink">Royal Artillery</a> in India. Wilton returned to Australia on the eve of World War II and was commissioned into the <a href="Royal_Australian_Artillery" title="wikilink">Royal Australian Artillery</a>. He saw action with the <a href="7th_Division_(Australia)" title="wikilink">7th Division</a> in <a href="Syria-Lebanon_Campaign" title="wikilink">Syria</a> and the <a href="3rd_Division_(Australia)" title="wikilink">3rd Division</a> in <a href="New_Guinea_Campaign" title="wikilink">New Guinea</a>, earning a <a href="mention_in_despatches" title="wikilink">mention in despatches</a> in the former campaign and the <a href="Distinguished_Service_Order" title="wikilink">Distinguished Service Order</a> in the latter. Finishing the war a temporary <a href="colonel" class="uri" title="wikilink">colonel</a>, he was appointed an <a href="Officer_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> in 1947. Wilton was posted to <a href="Korean_War" title="wikilink">Korea</a> in 1953 to take command of the <a href="28th_Infantry_Brigade_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">28th Commonwealth Brigade</a>, leading it in its final action of the war at the <a href="Battle_of_the_Samichon_River" title="wikilink">Battle of the Samichon River</a>. He was raised to <a href="Commander_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> and awarded the US <a href="Legion_of_Merit" title="wikilink">Legion of Merit</a> for his performance in Korea.</p>
<p>Wilton was promoted to <a href="major_general" title="wikilink">major general</a> in 1957 and became Commandant of Duntroon. He was appointed a <a href="Companion_of_the_Order_of_the_Bath" title="wikilink">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in 1962 and made CGS the following January, with the rank of <a href="lieutenant_general" title="wikilink">lieutenant general</a>. As CGS he oversaw a reorganisation of the Army&lt;U+2019&gt;s divisional structure, the reintroduction of conscription, and deployments during the <a href="Indonesia&lt;U+2013&gt;Malaysia_confrontation" title="wikilink">Indonesia&lt;U+2013&gt;Malaysia <em>Konfrontasi</em></a> and the Vietnam War. Knighted in 1964, he handed over the position of CGS in May 1966 and was appointed CCOSC. In this role he worked to achieve an integrated defence organisation, including a tri-services academy, a joint intelligence division, and the amalgamation of separate government departments for the Army, <a href="Royal_Australian_Navy" title="wikilink">Navy</a> and <a href="Royal_Australian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Air Force</a>, all of which were eventually realised. Wilton was promoted to <a href="general" class="uri" title="wikilink">general</a> in September 1968, and retired from the military in November 1970. He served as <a href="Consul_(representative)" title="wikilink">Consul-General</a> to the United States in 1973&lt;U+2013&gt;75, and died in 1981, aged seventy.</p>

<p>John Wilton was born in <a href="Sydney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sydney</a> on 22 November 1910, the second of two sons to English migrants Noel and Muriel Wilton. Noel was an electrical engineer, and moved with his family to <a href="Hobart" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hobart</a> in 1915 to take up employment with the Tasmanian Hydro Electric Department.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Attending various schools, John and his brother Maurice lived in Sydney for a time with Muriel following their parents' separation in 1917, before Noel brought them back to Hobart in 1921.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In 1923 he moved with them to <a href="Grafton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grafton</a>, New South Wales, where he managed the Clarence River County Council.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> John attended <a href="Grafton_High_School" title="wikilink">Grafton High School</a>, where he attained his <a href="leaving_certificate" title="wikilink">leaving certificate</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Considered by family to be a &quot;loner&quot;, &quot;a clear thinker&quot;, and a &quot;quite, determined, achiever&quot;, he entered the <a href="Royal_Military_College,_Duntroon" title="wikilink">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, in February 1927, aged sixteen.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Early on he was subjected to the usual <a href="hazing" title="wikilink">bastardisation</a> handed out to younger cadets by seniors, but was not known to inflict the same treatment on juniors once he reached the senior class.

<p>By 1930, the effects of the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a> had reduced the opportunities for Duntroon graduates.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Only four of Wilton's classmates joined the <a href="Australian_Military_Forces" title="wikilink">Australian Military Forces</a>, while four transferred to the <a href="Royal_Australian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) and four to the <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a>. Wilton was among the last-mentioned, taking a commission as a <a href="second_lieutenant" title="wikilink">second lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Royal_Artillery" title="wikilink">Royal Artillery</a>, with seniority from 22 November 1930.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Seeking active duty, he requested a posting to India, and sailed with the <a href="6th_(Howitzer)_Brigade_Royal_Field_Artillery" title="wikilink">6th Field Brigade</a> to <a href="Bombay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bombay</a> in November 1931.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> He spent the next three years based at <a href="Faizabad" title="wikilink">Fyzabad</a>, near the Nepalese border.

He was promoted to <a href="major_general" title="wikilink">major general</a> on 24 March 1957, and became Commandant of the Royal Military College, Duntroon.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> In 1959 he personally launched an appeal for public funds to build the College's Anzac Memorial Chapel, which would open in 1966.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Another of his goals was to see the college grant tertiary degrees to cadets; this was realised in 1968.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> From June 1960 through 1962, Wilton was Chief of the Military Planning Office at SEATO Headquarters, <a href="Bangkok" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bangkok</a>.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> He was appointed a <a href="Companion_of_the_Order_of_the_Bath" title="wikilink">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> (CB) in the 1962 Queen's Birthday Honours.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> On 21 January 1963, Wilton was promoted <a href="lieutenant_general" title="wikilink">lieutenant general</a> and became <a href="Chief_of_Army_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of the General Staff</a> (CGS), succeeding <a href="Reginald_Pollard" title="wikilink">Sir Reginald Pollard</a>.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> He was appointed a <a href="Knight_Commander_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (KBE) in the 1964 <a href="New_Year_Honours" title="wikilink">New Year Honours</a>.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>

<p>Following the lead of the US Army, in 1960 the Australian Army had replaced its former &quot;triangular&quot; divisional structure of three infantry battalions under a brigade headquarters, with a &quot;pentropic&quot; divisional organisation consisting of five larger battalions without a brigade layer in between. This had the effect of reducing the total number of Australian battalions, while increasing their individual strength.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Wilton was unhappy with the pentropic structure, reasoning that the number of battalions, rather than their relative strength, was the overriding factor when considering the Army's potential overseas deployments at this time. The US had in any event abandoned the system in June 1961. In October 1964, Wilton commissioned a review that ultimately recommended a return to the triangular formation.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> In the meantime, as a response to the <a href="Indonesia&lt;U+2013&gt;Malaysia_confrontation" title="wikilink">Indonesia&lt;U+2013&gt;Malaysia <em>Konfrontasi</em></a>, the Australian government reintroduced conscription, which Wilton fought until convinced that the government was not going to improve pay and conditions sufficiently to attract by any other means the recruits needed to meet overseas commitments.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Wilton was keen to mitigate any prejudices the national servicemen might have against the regular soldiery, and vice versa; when he found a memo from an Army committee asserting that &quot;it must be recognised that the NS man was likely to be a reluctant soldier&quot;, he wrote on it &quot;This assumption not justified&quot;.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> By March 1965, the government had despatched 1 Squadron, <a href="Special_Air_Service_Regiment" title="wikilink">Special Air Service Regiment</a>, and <a href="3rd_Battalion,_Royal_Australian_Regiment" title="wikilink">3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment</a>, to <a href="Borneo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Borneo</a>.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>

Wilton believed that both services would benefit from gaining familiarisation with air/ground operations in the region before large-scale commitment of Australian forces. He was exasperated when Murdoch rejected the idea on resourcing grounds, despite the fact that two-thirds of the RAAF's UH-1 complement had been purchased for the express purpose of army cooperation. The Australian government eventually overrode Murdoch, and <a href="No._9_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 9 Squadron</a>'s UH-1s were in action in Vietnam less than a year later.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a><a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>Wilton supported the RAAF's request that the deputy commander of Australian Forces Vietnam be an air officer, despite the misgivings of some senior Army personnel and the fact that such a senior appointment was not commensurate with the services' relative commitments to the conflict. In what the official history of Australia in the Vietnam War described as a &quot;pragmatic and far-sighted approach&quot;, Wilton expressed his hope that such an arrangement would give the Air Force a closer understanding of land/air cooperation, and avoid &quot;increasing differences of views about strategic and tactical concepts with the Australian Armed Forces&quot;.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Following the Federal government's decision in March 1966 to despatch a <a href="1st_Australian_Task_Force" title="wikilink">task force of two battalions</a> to Vietnam, Wilton negotiated with US and South Vietnamese commanders a self-contained operations area for the Australian troops, in <a href="Ph&lt;U+01B0&gt;&lt;U+1EDB&gt;c_Tuy_Province" title="wikilink">Ph&lt;U+01B0&gt;&lt;U+1EDB&gt;c Tuy Province</a>, where they could operate with a reasonable degree of independence and security.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a><a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> He rejected a mobile role for the Australians that would have placed them under the control of a US division because, he believed, &quot;their operations became a bit of a meat grinder&quot; with &quot;tremendous casualties&quot;.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> On 19 May 1966, Wilton took over from Air Chief Marshal <a href="Frederick_Scherger" title="wikilink">Sir Frederick Scherger</a> as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (CCOSC), a role predating that of the modern <a href="Chief_of_the_Defence_Force_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of the Defence Force</a>.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> He was succeeded as CGS by Lieutenant General Daly.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> According to the official history of the Vietnam War, the timing of the handover was &quot;especially significant&quot; as it &quot;coincided with the change in Vietnam from an Army force which was responsible to the Chief of the General Staff to a combined force responsive to the Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee. Wilton, therefore, carried through his responsibilities concerning the Vietnam commitment to his new appointment.&quot;<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="vietnam">Vietnam</h4>
<p>Wilton accepted the <a href="domino_theory" title="wikilink">domino theory</a> and never wavered in his commitment to Vietnam, but as early as mid-1967 he doubted that the war could won unless the US was prepared to go all out and invade the <a href="North_Vietnam" title="wikilink">the north</a>.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Cautious about expanding Australia's involvement, he advocated the deployment of a <a href="Centurion_tank" title="wikilink">Centurion tank</a> squadron rather than a third infantry battalion when calls came to increase the strength of the task force in Vietnam, but in the end both commitments were announced in October 1967. Wilton also resisted suggestions to rotate the Australian task force out of Ph&lt;U+01B0&gt;&lt;U+1EDB&gt;c Tuy, reasoning that it was more important for the troops to remain in countryside they knew and continue to build relations with the local people.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> He nevertheless strongly backed the Australian task force commander, Brigadier <a href="Ronald_Lawrence_Hughes" title="wikilink">Ronald Hughes</a>, when the latter was criticised at home for conducting &quot;American style operations&quot; outside the immediate vicinity of Ph&lt;U+01B0&gt;&lt;U+1EDB&gt;c Tuy, such as the set-piece <a href="Battle_of_Coral&lt;U+2013&gt;Balmoral" title="wikilink">battles of Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral</a> in mid-1968.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Wilton was promoted to <a href="General_(Australia)" title="wikilink">general</a> on 1 September that year, the first Australian officer to attain the rank since <a href="Thomas_Blamey" title="wikilink">Thomas Blamey</a>, twenty-seven years previously.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>

Wilton, Daly and other senior officers argued that that the &quot;balanced&quot; nature of the Australian task force would be damaged by a piecemeal withdrawal and that the only valid form of reduction would be &quot;one out, all out&quot;; in the event, a phased withdrawal took place, one battalion leaving in October 1970, and the other two in October and December 1971.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a><a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> The divisive nature of the war caused conflict within Wilton's own family; all his children actively opposed it, and in September 1969 his son Robert publicly burnt his draft deferment notice outside <a href="Parliament_House,_Canberra" title="wikilink">Parliament House, Canberra</a>, having earlier called upon students at the <a href="Australian_National_University" title="wikilink">Australian National University</a> not to register for national service. <em><a href="The_Canberra_Times" title="wikilink">The Canberra Times</a></em> ran an article on the Parliament House incident, complete with a photograph of Robert burning his notice. As Australia's senior soldier, Wilton refused to comment on the situation; Robert reported that he and his father respected one another's viewpoints, and relations within the family remained amicable.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a><a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<p>One of the most controversial aspects of Australia's conduct of the Vietnam War had been the employment of a barrier minefield around Ph&lt;U+01B0&gt;&lt;U+1EDB&gt;c Tuy from 1967 to 1969. Wilton maintained that the minefield was already under construction when he first learned of it, and that he considered the decision within the purview of the commander on the ground. When confronted with the increasing casualties among Australian troops from mines evidently lifted from the area by the <a href="Viet_Cong" title="wikilink">Viet Cong</a>, he pointed out that the South Vietnamese, who had been expected to patrol the minefield, were not playing their part. Wilton further believed that the barrier minefield was an innovative solution to the problems facing the task force and that the commander's decision to implement it was &quot;better than sitting on his backside and not trying anything&quot;. He rejected suggestions by critics that the minefield was &quot;the biggest blunder&quot; Australia made in Vietnam, declaring that this was &quot;like being wise after the event&quot;.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a><a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="joint-defence-aspirations">Joint defence aspirations</h4>
<p>Wilton's position as CCOSC had no statutory authority over the heads of the Army, Navy and Air Force, nor a direct line of command to Australian Forces Vietnam. David Horner noted that in an emergency situation, Wilton &quot;had to issue directives and then seek retrospective endorsement of them by either the minister or the Chiefs of Staff Committee.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> According to historian <a href="Eric_Andrews" title="wikilink">Eric Andrews</a>, Wilton &quot;chaffed over his lack of command over the services and the need for organisational reform&quot;.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> While CGS, he had joined Scherger in calling for a single Australian Defence Force organisation with one Minister of Defence, in contrast to the existing arrangement where each service operated with virtual autonomy, supported by its own minister and department.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a><a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> In July 1967, he became a member of the Tertiary Education (Services' Cadet Colleges) Committee to plan a tri-service military academy, which was eventually opened as the <a href="Australian_Defence_Force_Academy" title="wikilink">Australian Defence Force Academy</a> in 1986.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> He was also able to push through a plan to establish, in 1970, the <a href="Joint_Intelligence_Organisation" title="wikilink">Joint Intelligence Organisation</a> to replace the former Joint Intelligence Bureau and three single-service intelligence groups.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a><a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1967, and again in 1970, Wilton recommended the creation of a single Defence Board of Administration, consisting of the Defence Minister, the Defence Secretary, CCOSC, and the three service chiefs, to take over the functions of the Air, Military, and Naval Boards, along with those of their separate ministers. While nothing came of this at the time,<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> Wilton was consulted by the <a href="Australian_Labor_Party" title="wikilink">Labor Party</a> prior to its reorganisation of the Defence Department, which it commenced soon after defeating the <a href="Liberal_Party_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Liberals</a> in the December 1972 Federal election.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> The following year, the single-service ministries were abolished in favour of an all-encompassing <a href="Department_of_Defence_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Department of Defence</a>; by 1984, the CCOSC position had evolved to become the Chief of the Defence Force, directly commanding all three armed services through their respective chiefs.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>

<p>Wilton was succeeded as CCOSC by Admiral <a href="Victor_Smith" title="wikilink">Sir Victor Smith</a> on 23 November 1970, and retired from the military.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a><a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> He subsequently joined the <a href="John_Kerr_(governor-general)" title="wikilink">Kerr Committee</a> reviewing pay and conditions in the armed forces.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> Wilton finished his career as a diplomat, serving as Australia's <a href="Consul_(representative)" title="wikilink">Consul-General</a> in New York from September 1973 to November 1975.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a><a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> In 1979 he became one of the first sponsors of the Aboriginal Treaty Committee, which advocated for a treaty between the Federal government and <a href="Aboriginal_Australians" title="wikilink">Aboriginal</a> representatives.

<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
<p>Reflecting on Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, Wilton considered that it was justified, and that the West's intervention helped prevent communism spreading to Laos and Cambodia, as well as delaying the takeover of <a href="South_Vietnam" title="wikilink">South Vietnam</a> by almost a decade. &quot;Whether that was worthwhile&quot;, he added, &quot;is a matter for the historian to judge&quot;. The key lesson, he felt, was not to intervene in a conflict &quot;unless you are prepared to win&quot;, because it was &quot;not something that you can just put one foot in and feel the temperature&quot;.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<p>Biographer David Horner described Wilton as &quot;arguably the most important and influential Australian Army officer in the second half of the twentieth century&quot;.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> Horner credited him with making significant contributions to the evolution of the Australian Defence Force through the pursuit of joint command and control.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> He further noted that whereas Wilton's predecessor as CCOSC, Fred Scherger, had been promoted to 4-star rank after four years in the role, and Wilton himself after two-and-a-half, Wilton's successors gained their 4-star rank upon taking up the position, indicating its growing importance.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
<p>From an early age Wilton was considered cerebral and introspective; his colleagues in adulthood found him to have an incisive mind, high standards, and little inclination or capacity for small talk.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a><a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> His serious demeanour earned him the ironic nicknames &quot;Happy Jack&quot;, &quot;Smiling John&quot; and &quot;Sir Jovial&quot;, though he was capable of thoughtful gestures and flashes of humour.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a><a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> Major General <a href="Paul_Cullen_(general)" title="wikilink">Paul Cullen</a>, the <a href="Australian_Army_Reserve" title="wikilink">Citizen Military Forces</a> member of the Military Board from 1964 to 1966, described Wilton as &quot;very stiff, very regular, very formal&lt;U+2014&gt;but a pleasant man&quot;.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> Korean War historian <a href="Robert_O&#39;Neill" title="wikilink">Robert O'Neill</a> contended that &quot;One of the most remarkable aspects of his career was that he rose so far through a highly competitive profession without ever playing to the gallery.&quot;<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
