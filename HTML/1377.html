<p>The <strong>Earle Mack School of Law</strong> is the law school of <a href="Drexel_University" title="wikilink">Drexel University</a> in <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">USA</a>. The school opened in the fall of 2006 and was the first new law school in Philadelphia in over a thirty year time period,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and is the newest school within Drexel University. Serving only graduate students, the law school offers Juris Doctor degrees and provides the opportunity for all students to take part in a <a href="cooperative_education" title="wikilink">cooperative education</a> program.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>In 2005, <a href="Drexel_University" title="wikilink">Drexel University</a> announced its plans to create a new law school adjacent to the <a href="Drexel_University_Main_Campus" title="wikilink">Drexel University Main Campus</a> W. W. Hagerty library in <a href="West_Philadelphia" title="wikilink">West Philadelphia</a>. That same year Drexel received approval from the <a href="Pennsylvania_Department_of_Education" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Department of Education</a> to start the school.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The decision to launch a law school with cooperative education in a city with five other law schools was based on a demand for graduates with immediate experience, with the president of Drexel University, <a href="Constantine_Papadakis" title="wikilink">Constantine Papadakis</a>, saying that employers &quot;like to hire a graduate and have them immediately be useful.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The Earle Mack School of Law joins <a href="Temple_University_Beasley_School_of_Law" title="wikilink">Temple University</a>, <a href="University_of_Pennsylvania_Law_School" title="wikilink">University of Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="Villanova_University_School_of_Law" title="wikilink">Villanova University</a>, <a href="Rutgers_School_of_Law_-_Camden" title="wikilink">Rutgers</a>, and <a href="Widener_University_School_of_Law" title="wikilink">Widener University</a> to become the sixth law school in the <a href="Delaware_Valley" title="wikilink">Delaware Valley</a>. The School of Law is the first new law school to be opened by a doctoral university in a twenty-five year period nationwide.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="DUCOLconstruction.jpg" title="fig:The School of Law building during construction in 2006" alt="The School of Law building during construction in 2006" /> The inaugural class of the Earle Mack School of Law began classes on August 16, 2006. Due to a shortage of construction materials in 2006, caused in part by the need in the gulf coast due to <a href="Hurricane_Katrina" title="wikilink">Hurricane Katrina</a>, construction on the law school building was delayed, resulting in classes being held on Drexel University's Main Campus and within the Jenkins Law Library and the auditorium of the <a href="National_Constitution_Center" title="wikilink">National Constitution Center</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The first class was expected to be composed of 120 students; ultimately, the inaugural class consisted of 183 students with an incoming GPA of 3.4 and an <a href="Law_School_Admission_Test" title="wikilink">LSAT</a> score of 156.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The newest admitted class, the class of 2012, consists of 156 students with an incoming GPA of 3.4 and a median LSAT score of 160.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> On May 1, 2008 the Drexel University College of Law was renamed the Earle Mack School of Law in honor of <a href="Earle_I._Mack" title="wikilink">Earle I. Mack</a>, a Drexel University alumnus, after a donation of <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">$</a>15 <a href="million" class="uri" title="wikilink">million</a> dollars.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>As of July 2009, the School of Law has the third-highest Pennsylvania Bar Examination passage rate of any Pennsylvania law school at 89.84%<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="academics">Academics</h2>
<p>The Law School offers <a href="Juris_Doctor" title="wikilink">Juris Doctor</a> degrees and joint-degree programs for those pursuing a degree through Drexel University. The Law School received provisional accreditation from the American Bar Association in February 2008 enabling the first graduating class, 2009, to take the <a href="bar_examination" title="wikilink">bar exam</a> upon graduation.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The school concentrates on entrepreneurial business, health law, and intellectual property law and currently has 24 full time faculty members.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The Law School is the first to have enrolled all of its students in the Philadelphia Bar Association's Young Lawyers Section.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The students also have automatic membership to the <a href="Jenkins_Law_Library" title="wikilink">Jenkins Law Library</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="cooperative-education">Cooperative education</h3>
<p><img src="facade.DUCoL.jpg" title="fig:The front glass panels of the School of Law building" alt="The front glass panels of the School of Law building" width="225" /> Like Drexel University's <a href="The_Ultimate_Internship" title="wikilink">The Ultimate Internship</a>, the Law School offers cooperative education for its students. The Law School is the second law school in the country to have a co-op program for law students, the first being <a href="Northeastern_University,_Boston" title="wikilink">Northeastern University</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The first co-op cycle for the law school started in September 2007 and over ninety area corporations, law offices, judiciary positions, non-profit organizations, and government offices offered internship positions.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>During their first year at law school students concentrate on basics such as legal writing and contracts before starting their first six month co-op cycle.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In order to be eligible to participate in the program students must complete their first year with a minimum GPA and satisfy any job orientation that is required. While on co-op students are required to work at least 20 hours a week at their position and take an additional 3 credit hours in either a class or an approved academic program.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="facilities">Facilities</h2>
<p>In 2005, the Philadelphia Planning Commission approved Drexel's then estimated $13 million temporary law school.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Construction on the temporary law school building began in the fall of 2006 and was completed during the winter term. The $14 million building opened for classes on January 8, 2007.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The  complex features a <a href="moot_court" title="wikilink">moot courtroom</a>, a two-floor library, a two-story <a href="Atrium_(architecture)" title="wikilink">atrium</a> for meetings and casual conversation, faculty/staff offices, and several rooms available for students to meet and work. The building also shares Drexel's campus-wide <a href="Wi-Fi" title="wikilink">wireless Internet</a> access.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
