<p><strong>Insane Clown Posse</strong> is an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="hip_hop_music" title="wikilink">hip hop</a> <a href="Duet_(music)" title="wikilink">duo</a> from <a href="Delray,_Detroit" title="wikilink">Delray, Detroit</a>. The group comprises <a href="Joseph_Bruce" title="wikilink">Joseph Bruce</a> and <a href="Joseph_Utsler" title="wikilink">Joseph Utsler</a>, who perform under the respective personas of the murderous, <a href="Evil_clown" title="wikilink">wicked clowns</a> Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope. Insane Clown Posse performs a style of <a href="hardcore_hip_hop" title="wikilink">hardcore hip hop</a> known as <em><a href="horrorcore" class="uri" title="wikilink">horrorcore</a></em> and is known for its dark, violent lyrics and elaborate live performances. The duo has earned two <a href="Music_recording_sales_certification" title="wikilink">platinum</a> and three gold albums, but have been criticized for the violent content and perceived immature nature of their lyrics.</p>
<p>Originally known as <em>Inner City Posse,</em> Bruce and Utsler changed the group's name when prompted by a vision in a dream resembling a <a href="traveling_carnival" title="wikilink">traveling carnival</a>. The dream also inspired the introduction of <a href="supernatural" class="uri" title="wikilink">supernatural</a>-and <a href="horror_fiction" title="wikilink">horror</a>-themed lyrics. The duo founded the independent <a href="record_label" title="wikilink">record label</a> <a href="Psychopathic_Records" title="wikilink">Psychopathic Records</a> with Alex Abbiss as manager, and produced and starred in the feature film <em><a href="Big_Money_Hustlas" title="wikilink">Big Money Hustlas</a></em>. They formed their own <a href="wrestling" class="uri" title="wikilink">wrestling</a> federation, <a href="Juggalo_Championship_Wrestling" title="wikilink">Juggalo Championship Wrestling</a>, and later collaborated with many famous hip hop and <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a> musicians.</p>
<p>The themes of Insane Clown Posse and other acts on Psychopathic Records center on the mythology of the <a href="Dark_Carnival_(Insane_Clown_Posse)" title="wikilink">Dark Carnival</a>, which the duo claim is a spiritual force that has revealed a series of stories known as <em>Joker's Cards</em>. These stories each offer a specific lesson designed to change the &quot;evil ways&quot; of listeners before &quot;the end consumes us all.&quot; Insane Clown Posse has a dedicated following, often referred to by the group as <a href="Juggalo" title="wikilink">Juggalos</a> and Juggalettes.</p>

<h4 id="formation-of-the-group">Formation of the group</h4>
<p><a href="Joseph_Bruce" title="wikilink">Joseph Bruce</a> (Violent J) and <a href="Joseph_Utsler" title="wikilink">Joseph Utsler</a> (Shaggy 2 Dope) met in <a href="Oak_Park,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Oak Park</a>, a poor, crime-ridden suburb nine miles (fourteen km) north of <a href="Detroit,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Detroit, Michigan</a>. Along with Utsler's brother, John, and friend, Lacy, they wrestled in <a href="backyard_wrestling" title="wikilink">backyard rings</a> that they had built themselves.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In 1989, Joseph Bruce, as Jagged Joe, Joseph Utsler, as Kangol Joe, and John Utsler, as Master J, released the single entitled <em>Party at the Top of the Hill</em> under the name of <em>JJ Boys</em>, but they did not pursue a serious career in music.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Poverty and a difficult home life drove Bruce to move in with Rudy &quot;The Rude Boy&quot; Hill in the ghetto of <a href="River_Rouge,_Michigan" title="wikilink">River Rouge</a>, a residential neighborhood in the industrial southwest side of Detroit.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Feeling a sense of home and belonging, Bruce formed a gang called <em>Inner City Posse.</em> The gang consisted of Joseph Utsler, Rudy Hill, other friends of Bruce, and a number of other connections he had made in Southwest Detroit.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Bruce was jailed for ninety days in 1989&lt;U+2013&gt;1990 for death threats, robbery, and violating <a href="probation" class="uri" title="wikilink">probation</a>;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> this experience convinced him to reduce his involvement in gang life.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Bruce began his <a href="professional_wrestling" title="wikilink">professional wrestling</a> career after getting out of jail, and it was at his first show that he met <a href="Rob_Van_Dam" title="wikilink">Rob Van Dam</a> and <a href="Sabu_(wrestler)" title="wikilink">Sabu</a>, two other first-timers with whom he became very good friends.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> During this time Bruce brought Utsler backstage with him, and all four became close friends.</p>
<p>Bruce became frustrated with the backstage politics of the wrestling business and began searching for another career.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Back on the streets, Bruce began listening to hip hop with Utsler and with Utsler's brother, John. The trio performed at local night clubs, using the stage names Violent J, 2 Dope, and John Kickjazz, under the name of their gang, Inner City Posse.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Seeing a need for a manager, Bruce's brother <a href="Jumpsteady" title="wikilink">Robert</a> recommended his friend and record store owner Alex Abbiss, who established the <a href="Psychopathic_Records" title="wikilink">Psychopathic Records</a> record label with the group in 1991. Later that year the group released the self-produced <a href="EP" class="uri" title="wikilink">EP</a> entitled <em><a href="Dog_Beats" title="wikilink">Dog Beats</a></em>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Growing popularity in the local music scene turned negative for the group's gang, which became the target of growing violence. After receiving jail sentences, the group members abandoned gang life.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In late 1991 the group invested more money into production than was covered by returns. The group decided that its <a href="gangsta_rap" title="wikilink">gangsta rap</a> style was the cause of the problem: Most rappers at the time used similar styles, making it difficult for Inner City Posse to distinguish itself stylistically.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Referring to local rapper <a href="Esham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Esham</a>'s <a href="acid_rap" title="wikilink">acid rap</a> style, Bruce suggested the band adapt this genre, in a bid to have Detroit represent acid rap, much as <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> represented gangsta rap. The group agreed, but not to copying the style of Esham closely. Instead, they suggested using horror-themed lyrics as an emotional outlet for all their negative life experiences. They were also unanimous in deciding not to rap openly about <a href="Satan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Satan</a>, which Esham often did.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>After the change in musical style, the group decided it needed a new name. Utsler suggested keeping the &quot;I.C.P.&quot; initials to inform the community that Inner City Posse was not defunct, an idea to which the group agreed.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Several names were considered before Bruce recalled his dream of a clown running around in Delray, which became the inspiration for the group's new name: Insane Clown Posse. The other members agreed, deciding that they would take on this new genre and name, and would all don face paint due to the success of their former clown-painted <a href="promotion_(marketing)" title="wikilink">hype</a> man.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Upon returning home that night, Bruce had a dream in which spirits in a <a href="traveling_carnival" title="wikilink">traveling carnival</a> appeared to him—an image that would become the basis for the Dark Carnival mythology detailed in the group's Joker's Cards series.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="carnival-of-carnage-and-ringmaster"><em>Carnival of Carnage</em> and <em>Ringmaster</em></h4>
<p>The group began recording their debut album, <em><a href="Carnival_of_Carnage" title="wikilink">Carnival of Carnage</a></em>, with producer Chuck Miller. After recording only three songs for US$6,000 with Miller, Alex Abbiss made his first major managerial move by finding another producer, <a href="Mike_E._Clark" title="wikilink">Mike E. Clark</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The group finished recording the album with Clark, who continued to work with them throughout their career. The album featured appearances from local rappers, including Esham and <a href="Kid_Rock" title="wikilink">Kid Rock</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Just weeks prior to the release of their album, John left the group because he felt that it was &quot;taking up too much of [his] life.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> When Bruce and Utsler attempted to call a meeting to talk about the issues, John did not attend.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="the-great-milenko"><em>The Great Milenko</em></h4>
<p>Manager Alex Abbiss negotiated a contract with the <a href="The_Walt_Disney_Company" title="wikilink">Walt Disney Company</a>-owned label <a href="Hollywood_Records" title="wikilink">Hollywood Records</a>, that reportedly paid US$1 million to purchase the Insane Clown Posse contract from Jive Records.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The group started recording their fourth studio album, <em><a href="The_Great_Milenko" title="wikilink">The Great Milenko</a></em>, in 1996, during which Disney requested that the tracks &quot;The Neden Game&quot;, &quot;Under the Moon&quot;, and &quot;Boogie Woogie Wu&quot; be removed. Disney also asked that the lyrics of other tracks be changed, threatening to not release the album otherwise.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Bruce and Utsler complied with Disney's requests, and planned to go on a national tour with <a href="House_of_Krazees" title="wikilink">House of Krazees</a> and Myzery as their opening acts.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>During a music store autograph signing, Insane Clown Posse was notified that Hollywood Records had recalled the album within hours of its release,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> despite having sold 18,000 copies and reaching #63 on the <a href="Billboard_200" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> 200</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The group was also informed that its in-store signings and nationwide tour had been canceled, commercials for the album and the <a href="music_video" title="wikilink">music video</a> for &quot;Halls of Illusions&quot; (which had reached #1 on <a href="The_Box_(UK_TV_channel)" title="wikilink">The Box</a> video request channel) were pulled from television, and that the group was dropped from the label.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> It was later revealed that Disney was being criticized by the <a href="Southern_Baptist_Convention" title="wikilink">Southern Baptist Church</a> at the time because of Disney's promotion of &quot;Gay Days&quot; at <a href="Disneyland_Park_(Anaheim)" title="wikilink">Disneyland</a>, in addition to presiding over the gay-themed television sitcom <em><a href="Ellen_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Ellen</a></em>.

<p>After the termination of the Hollywood Records contract, Insane Clown Posse signed a new contract with <a href="Island_Records" title="wikilink">Island Records</a>, who agreed to release the uncensored version of <em>The Great Milenko</em>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> music critic <a href="David_Browne" title="wikilink">David Browne</a> gave the record a C-minus rating: &quot;[With] its puerile humor and intentionally ugly metal-rap tunes, the album feels oddly dated.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> <em>The Great Milenko</em> has been certified platinum with over 1.5 million copies sold.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> One of the group's first projects with Island Records was an hour-long documentary entitled <em>Shockumentary</em>, which aired on <a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a>.

<h4 id="extreme-championship-wrestling-appearance">Extreme Championship Wrestling appearance</h4>
<p>Two days before their rescheduled &quot;The Great Milenko Tour&quot; in August 1997, Bruce received a telephone call from friends Rob Van Dam and Sabu.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> They asked if he and Utsler could appear on <a href="Extreme_Championship_Wrestling" title="wikilink">Extreme Championship Wrestling</a> (ECW)'s second <a href="pay-per-view" class="uri" title="wikilink">pay-per-view</a> (PPV) program, <a href="ECW_Hardcore_Heaven#1997" title="wikilink">Hardcore Heaven</a>. Bruce and Utsler were already fans of ECW, as Van Dam had been sending videotapes of the show to them since its first airing.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> They agreed to appear and went to Florida to discuss the ECW program's content with Van Dam, Sabu, and <a href="Paul_Heyman" title="wikilink">Paul Heyman</a>. Heyman was pleased that Bruce and Utsler were former wrestlers, which meant that they could surprise the crowd by taking <a href="Bump_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">bumps</a>. Heyman also favored the idea of using Insane Clown Posse, because it was unlikely that anyone knew of the relationship the group had with Van Dam and Sabu.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Heyman presented his idea to Bruce and Utsler, who agreed to participate. Insane Clown Posse opened the ECW program by performing songs and exciting the crowd. Then Van Dam and Sabu, the main <a href="Heel_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">villains</a> at the time, attacked Bruce and Utsler. The top <a href="Face_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">fan favorite</a>, <a href="Jim_Fullington" title="wikilink">The Sandman</a>, came in and saved them by chasing away Van Dam and Sabu with his signature <a href="Shinai" title="wikilink">Singapore cane</a>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

Jones left the group, forcing House of Krazees to quit the tour.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>The success of the tour enabled Bruce and Utsler to purchase new houses both for each other and for their families.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Bruce even told his mother to quit her job because he would pay her expenses.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>

<p>Bruce and Utsler had two months off before their next tour and wanted to resume their involvement in wrestling. Being avid wrestling fans, they owned and were fascinated by the <a href="Hardcore_wrestling" title="wikilink">death match</a> wrestling collection <em>Outrageously Violent Wrestling from Japan.</em> Bruce and Utsler decided to create a compilation of their favorite matches, recording their own sports announcing under the personas named &quot;Gweedo&quot; (Utsler) and &quot;3D&quot; (Bruce).<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The compilation video was released nationwide under the title <em>ICP's Strangle-Mania</em>. The video's success allowed Bruce and Utsler to host their own wrestling show, <em>ICP's Strangle-Mania Live</em>, to a sold-out performance at St. Andrew's Hall. The main event featured Insane Clown Posse versus The Chicken Boys, who were played by two friends of Bruce and Utsler.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> With local wrestling <a href="List_of_professional_wrestling_slang#B" title="wikilink">booker</a> Dan Curtis, other wrestlers such as <a href="Mad_Man_Pondo" title="wikilink">Mad Man Pondo</a>, <a href="2_Tuff_Tony" title="wikilink">2 Tuff Tony</a>, <a href="Corporal_Robinson" title="wikilink">Corporal Robinson</a>, <a href="King_Kong_Bundy" title="wikilink">King Kong Bundy</a>, and <a href="Abdullah_the_Butcher" title="wikilink">Abdullah the Butcher</a> were also booked on the show to wrestle in the same death match style as shown in <em>ICP Strangle-Mania</em>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p>The night after <em>ICP's Strangle-Mania Live</em>, Bruce took the members of Myzery to St. Andrew's Hall. <a href="Eminem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eminem</a>, then an unknown local rapper, approached Bruce and handed him a flyer advertising the release party for <em><a href="The_Slim_Shady_EP" title="wikilink">The Slim Shady EP</a></em>. The flyer read, &quot;Featuring appearances by Esham, Kid Rock, and ICP (maybe).&quot;<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Bruce asked why Eminem was promoting a possible Insane Clown Posse appearance without first contacting the group.

You guys comin' to my release party, or what?&quot;<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Bruce, upset over not being consulted, responded, &quot;Fuck <em>no</em>, I ain't coming to your party.

Bruce and Utsler responded later in 1999 by releasing a parody of Eminem's &quot;<a href="My_Name_Is" title="wikilink">My Name Is</a>&quot; entitled &quot;Slim Anus.&quot; Barbs between Insane Clown Posse and Eminem continued.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>One month after <em>ICP's Strangle-Mania Live</em>, Insane Clown Posse began their second nationwide tour, &quot;The House of Horrors Tour&quot;, with Myzery added as one of the opening acts.

<p><img src="Insane_Clown_Posse_concert.jpg" title="fig:Insane Clown Posse perform in a 2007 concert." alt="Insane Clown Posse perform in a 2007 concert." /> Insane Clown Posse is known for their elaborate concert performances. In Marley Brant's <em>Tales from the Rock 'n' Roll Highway</em>, Bruce described a typical performance: &quot;We toss out, kick out, and shoot out into the crowd about three to four hundred two-liters of <a href="Faygo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Faygo</a> soda at every show. [...] We bring with us monsters, dancing clowns, girls, trampolines, and pure and absolute madness to the stage.&quot;<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> Performances feature backdrops including, among other settings, a <a href="game_show" title="wikilink">game show</a> set and a cemetery.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a><a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> Bruce stated, &quot;Shaggy and I know that without all that crazy shit going on around us, we'd just be two more idiots walking back and forth, rapping on stage. [...] ICP's motto has always been 'Fuck keepin' it real: we just keep it entertaining.'&quot;<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a></p>
<p>On tour following the release of <em>Carnival of Carnage</em>, Insane Clown Posse was scheduled to perform at Big Rapids University in Michigan. After the group was announced by their manager, Alex Abbiss, Bruce remembers that &quot;[w]e came out with no microphones or nothing; we were just right up in the people's faces. Shaggy and I were just fuckin' yelling over our own cassette. The people were staring at us in amazement and bewilderment. They must have been in shock and awe. We finished our two-song set, and the crowd [...] didn't cheer or boo. They just stood there, stunned.&quot;<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a></p>
<p>The group was unable to bring the large amounts of Faygo needed for their concerts to their European tours without a sales permit <a href="Visa_(document)" title="wikilink">visa</a> because <a href="customs" class="uri" title="wikilink">customs</a> believed that the group had intended to sell the soda at their concerts.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> As a result, the group's European record label purchased similar quantities of another soda and creating fake Faygo stickers to label the bottles. According to Bruce, &quot;The craziness was this: they were not the regular two-liter bottles we're used to; they were some other amount [...] maybe one-and-a-half-liter bottles. Over there, they make their plastic bottles taller and thinner. [...] when you're doing what we do with them&lt;U+2014&gt;that makes a world of difference.&quot;<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> During a performance in England, Bruce recounts that he &quot;rocketed one of them bottles off my foot and that motherfucker shot straight up and out like a guided <a href="MIM-104_Patriot" title="wikilink">Patriot missile</a>, right towards the <a href="disco_ball" title="wikilink">disco ball</a> high above the crowd. [...] The bottle nailed the disco ball, and [...] came falling down [...] on top of some English kid's head. [...] We must've knocked fifteen or twenty people flat-out cold on that tour [...] Shaggy and I both had black eyes and several injuries and bruises ourselves from them things hittin' us.&quot;<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a></p>
<p>Bruce and Utsler did not expect many of their fans to attend Woodstock 1999, and were surprised when thousands of people chanted &quot;I-C-P! I-C-P!&quot; as they waited for the group to perform.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a> Bruce told his stage crew that he would pay US$2,000 to each person who ran around the stage naked, and two people took up his offer. Insane Clown Posse also brought naked women on stage.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> Bruce and Utsler felt that because the tickets to the event were over-priced, they needed to &quot;give something back.&quot;<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> According to Bruce, &quot;We brought along these big beach balls.
