He was the foremost French composer of his generation, and his musical style influenced many 20th century composers. His <a href="harmony_(music)" title="wikilink">harmonic</a> and <a href="melody" title="wikilink">melodic</a> language affected how harmony was later taught.</p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; was born in <a href="Pamiers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pamiers</a>, <a href="Ari&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ari&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge</a>, <a href="Midi-Pyr&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E9&gt;es" class="uri" title="wikilink">Midi-Pyr&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E9&gt;es</a>, to Toussaint-Honor&lt;U+00E9&gt; Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; and Marie-Antoinette-H&lt;U+00E9&gt;l&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne Lal&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne-Laprade. He was sent to live with a foster-nurse for four years. At the age of nine he was sent to study at the <a href="Abraham_Louis_Niedermeyer" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C9&gt;cole Niedermeyer</a>, a school which prepared church organists and choir directors in Paris, and continued there for eleven years. He studied with several prominent French musicians, including <a href="Camille_Saint-Sa&lt;U+00EB&gt;ns" title="wikilink">Camille Saint-Sa&lt;U+00EB&gt;ns</a>, who introduced him to the music of several contemporary composers, including <a href="Robert_Schumann" title="wikilink">Robert Schumann</a> and <a href="Franz_Liszt" title="wikilink">Franz Liszt</a>. <img src="Gabriel_Faure_1864.jpg" title="fig:Gabriel Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; in 1864." alt="Gabriel Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; in 1864." width="200" /></p>
<p>In 1870, Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; enlisted in the army and took part in the action to raise the <a href="Siege_of_Paris" title="wikilink">Siege of Paris</a> during the <a href="Franco-Prussian_War" title="wikilink">Franco-Prussian War</a>. During the <a href="Paris_Commune" title="wikilink">Paris Commune</a> he stayed at <a href="Rambouillet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rambouillet</a> and in Switzerland, where he taught at the transported &lt;U+00C9&gt;cole Niedermeyer. When he returned to Paris in October 1871, he was appointed assistant organist at <a href="Saint-Sulpice_(Paris)" title="wikilink">Saint-Sulpice</a> as accompanist to the choir, and became a regular at Saint-Sa&lt;U+00EB&gt;ns' <a href="salon_(gathering)" title="wikilink">salon</a>. Here he met many prominent Parisian musicians and with those he met there and at the salon of <a href="Pauline_Garcia-Viardot" title="wikilink">Pauline Garcia-Viardot</a> he formed the <a href="Soci&lt;U+00E9&gt;t&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Nationale_de_Musique" title="wikilink">Soci&lt;U+00E9&gt;t&lt;U+00E9&gt; Nationale de Musique</a>.</p>
<p>In 1874, Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; stopped working at Saint-Sulpice and began to fill in at the <a href="&lt;U+00C9&gt;glise_de_la_Madeleine" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C9&gt;glise de la Madeleine</a> for Saint-Sa&lt;U+00EB&gt;ns during his many absences. When Saint-Sa&lt;U+00EB&gt;ns retired in 1877, Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; became choirmaster. In the same year he became engaged to Marianne Viardot, daughter of Pauline, but the engagement was later broken off by Marianne. Following this disappointment he travelled to <a href="Weimar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Weimar</a>, where he met Liszt, and <a href="Cologne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cologne</a> in order to see productions of <a href="Richard_Wagner" title="wikilink">Richard Wagner</a>'s <em><a href="Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen" title="wikilink">Der Ring des Nibelungen</a></em>. Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; admired Wagner, but was one of few composers of his generation not to come under his influence.</p>
<p>In 1883, Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; married Marie Fremiet, with whom he had two sons. In order to support his family Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; spent most of his time in organising daily services at the &lt;U+00C9&gt;glise de la Madeleine and teaching piano and harmony lessons. He only had time to compose during the summers. He earned almost no money from his compositions because his publisher bought them, copyright and all, for 50 <a href="French_franc" title="wikilink">francs</a> each. During this period Gabriel Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; wrote several large scale works, in addition to many piano pieces and songs, but he destroyed many of them after a few performances, only retaining a few movements in order to re-use motives.</p>
<p>During his youth Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; was very cheerful, but his broken engagement combined with his perceived lack of musical success led to bouts of <a href="depression_(mood)" title="wikilink">depression</a> which he described as &quot;<a href="spleen#Etymology_and_cultural_views" title="wikilink">spleen</a>&quot;. In the 1890s, however, his fortunes reversed somewhat. He had a successful trip to <a href="Venice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venice</a> where he met with friends and wrote several works. In 1892, he became the inspector of the music conservatories in the French provinces, which meant he no longer had to teach amateur students. In 1896, he finally became chief organist at the &lt;U+00C9&gt;glise de la Madeleine, and also succeeded <a href="Jules_Massenet" title="wikilink">Jules Massenet</a> as composition instructor at the <a href="Conservatoire_de_Paris" title="wikilink">Conservatoire de Paris</a>. At this post he taught many important French composers, including <a href="Maurice_Ravel" title="wikilink">Maurice Ravel</a> and <a href="Nadia_Boulanger" title="wikilink">Nadia Boulanger</a>.</p>
<p>From 1903 to 1921, Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; was a critic for <em><a href="Le_Figaro" title="wikilink">Le Figaro</a></em>. In 1905, he succeeded <a href="Th&lt;U+00E9&gt;odore_Dubois" title="wikilink">Th&lt;U+00E9&gt;odore Dubois</a> as director of the Paris Conservatory. He made many changes at the Conservatoire, leading to the resignation of a number of faculty members. This position meant that he was better off in terms of income, and he also became much more widely known as a composer.</p>
<p>Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; was elected to the <a href="Institut_de_France" title="wikilink">Institut de France</a> in 1909, but at the same time he broke with the <a href="Soci&lt;U+00E9&gt;t&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Nationale_de_Musique" title="wikilink">Soci&lt;U+00E9&gt;t&lt;U+00E9&gt; Nationale de Musique</a>, and supported the rogue group which formed out of those ejected from the Soci&lt;U+00E9&gt;t&lt;U+00E9&gt;, mainly his own students. During this time Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; developed ear trouble and gradually lost his hearing. Sound not only became fainter, but it was also distorted, so that pitches on the low and high ends of his hearing sounded like other pitches. He made efforts to conceal his difficulty, but was eventually forced to abandon his teaching position.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>His responsibilities at the Conservatoire, combined with his hearing loss, meant that Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s output was greatly reduced during this period. During World War I Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; remained in France. In 1920, at the age of 75, he retired from the Conservatoire mainly due to his increasing deafness.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In this year he also received the Grand-Croix of the <a href="L&lt;U+00E9&gt;gion_d&#39;Honneur" title="wikilink">L&lt;U+00E9&gt;gion d'Honneur</a>, an honor rare for a musician. He suffered from poor health, partially brought on by heavy smoking. Despite this, he remained available to young composers, including members of <a href="Les_Six" title="wikilink">Les Six</a>, who were devoted to him.</p>
<p>Gabriel Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; died in Paris from <a href="pneumonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">pneumonia</a> in 1924. He was given a state funeral at the <a href="&lt;U+00C9&gt;glise_de_la_Madeleine" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C9&gt;glise de la Madeleine</a> and is buried in the <a href="Cimeti&lt;U+00E8&gt;re_de_Passy" title="wikilink">Cimeti&lt;U+00E8&gt;re de Passy</a> in Paris.</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Gabriel Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; is regarded as the master of the French art song, or <a href="m&lt;U+00E9&gt;lodie" class="uri" title="wikilink">m&lt;U+00E9&gt;lodie</a>. His works ranged from an early romantic style, when in his early years he emulated the style of <a href="Felix_Mendelssohn" title="wikilink">Mendelssohn</a> and others, to late 19th century <a href="Romantic_music" title="wikilink">Romantic</a>, and finally to a <a href="20th_century_classical_music" title="wikilink">20th century</a> aesthetic. His work was based on a strong understanding of harmonic structures which he received at the <a href="Louis_Niedermeyer" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C9&gt;cole Niedermeyer</a> from his harmony teacher Gustave Lef&lt;U+00E8&gt;vre, who wrote the book <em>Trait&lt;U+00E9&gt; d'harmonie</em> (Paris, 1889), in which Lef&lt;U+00E8&gt;vre sets forth a harmonic theory which differs significantly from the classical theory of <a href="Jean-Philippe_Rameau" title="wikilink">Jean-Philippe Rameau</a> in that seventh and ninth chords are no longer considered <a href="Consonance_and_dissonance" title="wikilink">dissonant</a>, and the <a href="mediant" class="uri" title="wikilink">mediant</a> can be altered without changing the <a href="Musical_mode" title="wikilink">mode</a>. In addition, Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s understanding of the church modes can be seen in various modal passages in his works, especially in his melodies.</p>
<p>In contrast with his harmonic and melodic style, which pushed the bounds for his time, Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s rhythmic motives tended to be subtle and repetitive, with little to break the flow of the line, although he did utilize subtle large scale syncopations, similar to those found in <a href="Johannes_Brahms" title="wikilink">Brahms</a>'s works. <a href="Aaron_Copland" title="wikilink">Aaron Copland</a> referred to him as the 'French Brahms'.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s piano works often use <a href="Arpeggio" title="wikilink">arpeggiated</a> figures with the melody interspersed between the two hands, and include finger substitutions natural for organists. These aspects make them daunting for some pianists, but they are nonetheless central works.</p>
<h3 id="notable-works">Notable works</h3>
<p>Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; was a prolific composer, and among the most noteworthy of his works are his <em><a href="Requiem_(Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt;)" title="wikilink">Requiem</a></em>, the <a href="opera" class="uri" title="wikilink">opera</a> <em><a href="P&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E9&gt;lope_(opera)" title="wikilink">P&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E9&gt;lope</a></em>, the <a href="orchestral_suite" title="wikilink">orchestral suite</a> <em><a href="Masques_et_Bergamasques" title="wikilink">Masques et Bergamasques</a></em> (based on music for a dramatic entertainment, or <em>divertissement comique</em>), and music for <em><a href="Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as_et_M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande_(Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt;)" title="wikilink">Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as et M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande</a></em>. He also wrote <a href="chamber_music" title="wikilink">chamber music</a>; his two <a href="piano_quartet" title="wikilink">piano quartets</a> are particularly well known. Other chamber music includes two <a href="piano_quintet" title="wikilink">piano quintets</a>, two <a href="cello_sonata" title="wikilink">cello sonatas</a>, two <a href="violin_sonata" title="wikilink">violin sonatas</a>, a <a href="string_quartet" title="wikilink">string quartet</a> and a number of <a href="piano" class="uri" title="wikilink">piano</a> pieces including the <em>Nocturnes</em>. He is also known for his songs, such as <em>Apr&lt;U+00E8&gt;s un r&lt;U+00EA&gt;ve</em>, <em>Les roses d'Ispahan</em>, <em>En pri&lt;U+00E8&gt;re</em>, and several <a href="song_cycle" title="wikilink">song cycles</a>, including <em><a href="La_Bonne_Chanson" title="wikilink">La Bonne Chanson</a></em> with settings of poems by <a href="Paul_Verlaine" title="wikilink">Verlaine</a>, and <em>L'horizon chim&lt;U+00E9&gt;rique</em>.</p>
<p>The <em><a href="Requiem_(Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt;)" title="wikilink">Requiem</a></em>, Op. 48, was not composed to the memory of a specific person but, in Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s words, &quot;for the pleasure of it.&quot; It was first performed in 1888. Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt; is thought not to have had strong religious beliefs . It has been described as &quot;a lullaby of death&quot;. In setting his <a href="requiem" class="uri" title="wikilink">requiem</a>, he left out the <em><a href="Dies_irae" title="wikilink">Dies irae</a></em>, though the reference to the day of judgment appears in the <em><a href="Requiem#Libera_me" title="wikilink">Libera me</a></em>, which, like <a href="Giuseppe_Verdi" title="wikilink">Giuseppe Verdi</a>, he added to the normal requiem mass. Several slightly different versions of the <em>Requiem</em> exist, and these have given rise to a number of different recordings. Personal grief may have influenced the composition as it was started after the death of his father, and before it was completed, his mother died as well. The <em>Requiem</em> can thus be seen as an expression of Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s personal tragedy written after the death of his parents. The <em>Requiem</em> is also acknowledged as a source of inspiration for the similar setting by <a href="Maurice_Durufl&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Maurice Durufl&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a>.</p>
<p>His music is used in &quot;Act I: Emeralds&quot; of <a href="George_Balanchine" title="wikilink">George Balanchine</a>'s ballet <em>Jewels</em> (1967).</p>
<p>In the UK, the Berceuse from his Dolly Suite became known to several generations of children when it was used as the closing music for the radio programme <em><a href="Listen_with_Mother" title="wikilink">Listen with Mother</a></em>, which ran from 1950 to 1982.</p>
