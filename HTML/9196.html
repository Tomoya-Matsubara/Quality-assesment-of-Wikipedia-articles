<p><strong>Joseph Emley Borden</strong> (May 9, 1854 &lt;U+2013&gt; October 14, 1929) was an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="starting_pitcher" title="wikilink">starting pitcher</a> in professional baseball for two seasons. Born in <a href="Jacobstown,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Jacobstown, New Jersey</a>, his recored professional team was the <a href="Philadelphia_White_Stockings" title="wikilink">Philadelphia White Stockings</a> of the <a href="National_Association_of_Professional_Base_Ball_Players" title="wikilink">National Association</a> {NA) in . It was during the 1875 season that he pitched the first <a href="no-hitter" class="uri" title="wikilink">no-hitter</a> in a professional game.</p>
<p>When the NA folded after the 1875 season, he joined the <a href="Atlanta_Braves" title="wikilink">Boston Red Caps</a>, formerly the Red Stockings who had transferred operations to the newly established <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> {NL) for the  season. He is credited with a pitching victory in the NL's first game on April 22, and pitched a <a href="shutout" class="uri" title="wikilink">shutout</a> on May 23, which some claim was the first no-hitter in <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a>. Known for having an eccentric personality, he played under different surnames, such as Josephs and Nedrob. Little is known about his post-baseball life, and his death has been reportedly as early as 1889 in the <a href="Johnstown_Flood" title="wikilink">Johnstown Flood</a>, but it is officially recognized as occuring in 1929 at the age of 75.</p>

<p>He first appeared in a professional baseball game on July 24, 1875 with <a href="Philadelphia_White_Stockings" title="wikilink">Philadelphia White Stockings</a> of the <a href="National_Association_of_Professional_Base_Ball_Players" title="wikilink">National Association</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> During his time with the White Stockings, he pitched in seven <a href="games_pitched" title="wikilink">games</a>, all of which he <a href="games_started" title="wikilink">started</a> and <a href="complete_game" title="wikilink">completed</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He pitched two <a href="shutout" title="wikilink">shutouts</a> in 1875, however, the one on July 28 was a <a href="no-hitter" class="uri" title="wikilink">no-hitter</a> against the <a href="Chicago_Cubs" title="wikilink">Chicago White Stockings</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> This is considered the first no-hitter ever thrown in a professional game, since the National Association is not considered a <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League</a>. The <a href="umpire_(baseball)" title="wikilink">umpire</a> for the game was future <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> (NL) President <a href="Nicholas_Young_(executive)" title="wikilink">Nicholas Young</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> He finished the season with a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;4 <a href="Win&lt;U+2013&gt;loss_record" title="wikilink">Win&lt;U+2013&gt;loss record</a>, and a 1.50 <a href="earned_run_average" title="wikilink">earned run average</a> in 66 <a href="innings_pitched" title="wikilink">innings pitched</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="season-1">1876 season</h3>
<p>After the 1875 season closed, the league, and subsequently the Philadelphia White Stockings, folded, allowing for the <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> (NL) to be founded as the first Major League.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Borden signed a three-year contract worth $2000 a season with the <a href="Atlanta_Braves" title="wikilink">Boston Red Caps</a> of the NL before the 1876 season.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The club had hoped that he could adequately fill in for the recently departed <a href="Albert_Spalding" title="wikilink">Albert Spalding</a>, who had moved on to play for the <a href="Chicago_White_Stockings" title="wikilink">Chicago White Stockings</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> <a href="National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum" title="wikilink">Hall of fame</a> baseball writer <a href="Henry_Chadwick_(writer)" title="wikilink">Henry Chadwick</a> described Borden's pitching style as fast, but without strategy.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In addiction to a swiftly-moving <a href="fastball" class="uri" title="wikilink">fastball</a>, he also delivered a <a href="curveball" class="uri" title="wikilink">curveball</a> that moved down and away from right-handed batters, both of which he threw from a low angle.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> His Red Caps played the <a href="Philadelphia_Athletics_(1860&lt;U+2013&gt;1876)" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Athletics</a> in the first game in NL history on April 22; due to other games being cancelled becuase of rain showers, it was the only game played that day. The Red Caps defeated the Athletics with two <a href="run_(baseball)" title="wikilink">runs</a> by the score of 6&lt;U+2013&gt;5 at <a href="Jefferson_Street_Grounds" title="wikilink">Athletic Park</a>, with Borden pitching the complete game for the victory.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>On May 23, Borden seemingly pitched a two-hit shutout, 8&lt;U+2013&gt;0 victory against the <a href="Cincinnati_Reds_(1876&lt;U+2013&gt;1880)" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Reds</a>, but some historians claim that this was, in fact, the first no-hitter thrown in the NL, thus becoming the first Major League no-hitter.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> According to <a href="Lee_Allen_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Lee Allen</a>, baseball historian and writer, the scorecard shows that Borden gave up two <a href="base_on_balls" title="wikilink">bases on balls</a>, which were counted as <a href="hit_(baseball)" title="wikilink">hits</a> in the final score.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The offical scorekeeper for the game was <a href="O._P._Caylor" title="wikilink">O. P. Caylor</a>, a writer for <em><a href="The_Cincinnati_Enquirer" title="wikilink">The Cincinnati Enquirer</a></em>, who believed, unlike his contemporaries, that bases on balls should be scored as hits.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Bases on balls were not official counted as hits until , but officially reverted following that season.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> This hypothesis is not without dispute however; <em>The Boston Daily Globe</em> reported on the game the following day, and noted that Reds had, in fact had two clean one-base hits during the game.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Furthermore, on June 6, the <em><a href="New_York_Clipper" title="wikilink">New York Clipper</a></em> did not report an occurance of a no-hitter in their report of the game, though the <a href="box_score" title="wikilink">box score</a> did have differing stats in other categories than what the <em>Daily Globe</em> had reported.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Consequently, the first official no-hitter in Major League history was pitched by <a href="George_Bradley" title="wikilink">George Bradley</a>, of the <a href="St._Louis_Brown_Stockings" title="wikilink">St. Louis Brown Stockings</a> on July 15, 1876.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Two days after his controversial near no-hitter, on May 25, Borden and the Red Caps faced the Reds again; this time against <a href="Cherokee_Fisher" title="wikilink">Cherokee Fisher</a>, resulting in a scoreless game through nine innings.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The Red Caps scored four runs in tenth inning for a 4-0 victory.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Unfortunely for Borden, his pitching effectivelness declined rapidly after this, at one point he reportedly threw a tantrum during a game, due to his inaccurate pitching, even admonishing his teammate, future Hall of famer <a href="George_Wright_(sportsman)" title="wikilink">George Wright</a>, who was known to be a good-natured person.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Due to his erratic pitching and behavior, he was released from the team by August.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="post-baseball-career">Post-baseball career</h2>
<p>Though the Red Caps still had released him as a player, they still employed him as a ticket-taker and groundskeeper due to the fact that he was still under contract.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> He also reportedly found work stitching baseballs in <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a>Little is known of Borden's life after baseball, and it has been alledged that he died in May of 1889 during the <a href="Johnstown_Flood" title="wikilink">Johnstown Flood</a>, the same disaster that stranded the entire <a href="Louisville_Colonels" title="wikilink">Louisville Colonels</a> team.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Official he died in <a href="Yeadon,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Yeadon, Pennsylvania</a> at the age of 75, and is interred at <a href="Oaklands_Cemetery" title="wikilink">Oaklands Cemetery</a> in <a href="West_Chester,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">West Chester, Pennsylvania</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
