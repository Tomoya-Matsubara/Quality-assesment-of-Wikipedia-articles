<p><strong>Another Rainbow Publishing</strong> is a company dedicated to the re-publication and greater recognition of the work of <a href="Carl_Barks" title="wikilink">Carl Barks</a> that was created in 1981 by Bruce Hamilton and <a href="Russ_Cochran_(publisher)" title="wikilink">Russ Cochran</a>. Its name references Barks's saying that there would be &quot;always another rainbow&quot; for his character <a href="Scrooge_McDuck" title="wikilink">Scrooge McDuck</a>, which also became the title of one of Barks's oil paintings of the richest duck in the world<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Its subsidiary division &quot;<a href="Gladstone_Publishing" title="wikilink">Gladstone Publishing</a>&quot;, founded in 1985, for non-Barks Disney comics several times throughout the 1980s and 1990s became the major to only publisher of Disney comics in the USA.</p>
<p>Having finished the thirty-volume <em><a href="Carl_Barks_Library" title="wikilink">Carl Barks Library</a></em>, Another Rainbow Publishing is no longer an active publisher, although they still sell previously published works.</p>
<h2 id="publications">Publications</h2>
<p>In 1983 Another Rainbow published the entire <a href="Disney_comics" title="wikilink">Disney comic book</a> works of Barks&lt;U+2014&gt;over 500 stories in all&lt;U+2014&gt;in the ten-set, thirty-volume <em>Carl Barks Library</em>. These oversized hardbound volumes reproduced Barks' pages in pristine black and white <a href="line_art" title="wikilink">line art</a>, as close as possible to the way he had originally drawn them, and included many special features, articles, reminiscences, interviews, storyboards, and critiques. This project was completed in mid-1990. Another Rainbow subsidiary Gladstone publishing completed the re-publication of Barks's entire work, this time in color, from 1992 to 1998.</p>
<p>Another Rainbow Publishing also produced and issued the award-winning book <em>The Fine Art of Walt Disney's Donald Duck by Carl Barks</em>, a comprehensive collection of the Disney duck paintings of this artist and storyteller. Not long after, the company began producing <a href="fine_art" title="wikilink">fine art</a> lithographs of many of these paintings, in strictly <a href="Special_edition" title="wikilink">limited editions</a>, all signed by Barks, who eventually produced many original works for the series.</p>
<h2 id="disney-figurines">Disney Figurines</h2>
<p>Having established itself as a publisher of specialty books and lithographs based on the works of Carl Barks, Another Rainbow launched an ambitious project of creating limited edition bone-china figurines based on Barks Disney characters - especially &quot;Uncle&quot; Scrooge McDuck and Donald Duck. Connoisseur of Malvern (UK), which also produced figurines for Buckingham Palace and the Whitehouse, manufactured 7 of these figurines (Under Carl Barks direction) which ranged in price from $1980 to $19,500. The earlier releases sold out rapidly - although, there were a number of later editions unsold by the time Another Rainbow's license with Disney expired.</p>
<p>In 2001, all of these figurines were destroyed due to a licensing disagreement with the new management at the <a href="Walt_Disney_Company" title="wikilink">Walt Disney Company</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="gladstone-publishing">Gladstone Publishing</h2>
<p>In 1985 a new division was founded, &quot;<a href="Gladstone_Publishing" title="wikilink">Gladstone Publishing</a>&quot;, which took up the then-dormant Disney comic book license. Gladstone published Disney comic books by Barks, <a href="Paul_Murry" title="wikilink">Paul Murry</a>, and <a href="Floyd_Gottfredson" title="wikilink">Floyd Gottfredson</a>, and also presented the first works of modern Disney comics masters <a href="Don_Rosa" title="wikilink">Don Rosa</a> and <a href="William_Van_Horn" title="wikilink">William Van Horn</a>. Gladstone's books were also among the first in the United States to regularly include Disney comics produced in Europe. The company was based in <a href="Scottsdale,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Scottsdale, Arizona</a>, but moved in 1987 to <a href="Prescott,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Prescott, Arizona</a>.</p>
