<p><img src="Ridge_route_map_LATimes.png" title="fig:A map of the Ridge Route drawn in 1919" alt="A map of the Ridge Route drawn in 1919" /> The <strong>Ridge Route</strong>, officially the <strong>Castaic-Tejon Route</strong>, is a narrow two-lane <a href="highway" class="uri" title="wikilink">highway</a> in the northern <a href="Greater_Los_Angeles_Area" title="wikilink">Greater Los Angeles Area</a> of the <a href="U.S._state" title="wikilink">U.S. state</a> of <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>. Completed in 1919, the road was the first <a href="paved_highway" title="wikilink">paved highway</a> linking the <a href="Los_Angeles_Basin" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Basin</a> with the <a href="San_Joaquin_Valley" title="wikilink">San Joaquin Valley</a>; it was particularly used to travel from the city of <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> to and beyond <a href="Bakersfield,_CA" title="wikilink">Bakersfield</a>. The road was bypassed in 1933 by the new <a href="U.S._Route_99_(California)" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 99</a>, since upgraded to the modern <a href="Interstate_5_(California)" title="wikilink">Interstate 5</a>, and much of it now lies within the <a href="Angeles_National_Forest" title="wikilink">Angeles National Forest</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>In 1895, the State Bureau of Highways was created by Governor <a href="James_H._Budd" title="wikilink">James H. Budd</a> who appointed three highway commissioners: R.C. Irvine of <a href="Sacramento,_California" title="wikilink">Sacramento</a>, Marsden Manson of <a href="San_Francisco,_California" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a> and L. Maude of <a href="Riverside,_California" title="wikilink">Riverside</a>.</p>
<p>After purchasing a team of horses and a buckboard wagon, Irvine, Manson and Maude set out on a <a href="surveying" class="uri" title="wikilink">surveying</a> trip to determine the feasibility of connecting the state via a network of state-run <a href="highway" title="wikilink">highways</a> running between major population centers. Eighteen months and 7000 <a href="mile" title="wikilink">miles</a> (11,000 <a href="kilometre" title="wikilink">km</a>) later, they submitted their recommendation which included a direct route between Los Angeles to the San Joaquin Valley.</p>
<p>The <a href="California_Legislature" title="wikilink">California Legislature</a> of 1897 dissolved the Bureau of Highways and created a Department of Highways which immediately set to work studying <a href="road_construction" title="wikilink">road construction</a> practices in <a href="Western_Europe" title="wikilink">Western Europe</a>.</p>
<p>Surveying began in 1912 on what was to be California's first major mountain road. Since such a road had never been attempted, the Ridge Route was considered by the <a href="Automobile_Club_of_Southern_California" title="wikilink">Automobile Club of Southern California</a> to be the greatest feat of road engineering to date. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Compared to the established construction practices of <a href="railroad" title="wikilink">railroads</a> over rugged terrain, with a grade of perhaps two percent, the Ridge Route permitted steeper grades and sharper turns than any railroad, with grades up to six percent. The <a href="July_1" title="wikilink">July 1</a>, <a href="1916" class="uri" title="wikilink">1916</a> edition of the <em>California Highway Bulletin</em> quoted the <em><a href="San_Francisco_Chronicle" title="wikilink">San Francisco Chronicle</a></em> that same year as saying that the Ridge Route was &quot;one of the most remarkable engineering feats accomplished by the State Highway Commission. It is Southern California's <em><a href="magnum_opus" title="wikilink">Magnus Opus</a></em> (<a href="sic" class="uri" title="wikilink">sic</a>) in mountain highway construction.&quot; <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>This project would also include two major <a href="fill" title="wikilink">cuts</a> through solid rock, Swede's Cut and Beale's Cut. Beale's Cut was named for General <a href="Edward_Fitzgerald_Beale" title="wikilink">Edward Fitzgerald Beale</a>, federal Surveyor-General of California and Nevada and famous for his 1857 trek across the desert regions of Southern California by camel. Beale dispatched a crew of Chinese laborers in 1862 to widen an 1858 cut established for the <a href="Butterfield_Overland_Mail" title="wikilink">Butterfield Overland Stage</a>. Beale's crew expanded the passage to 12 <a href="foot_(unit_of_length)" title="wikilink">feet</a> (4 m) through 60 feet (18 m) of sandstone to reduce the climb by 50 feet (15 m). The first automobile went over the pass in 1902. Until the 435 feet (133 m) Newhall Tunnel opened in October 1910, Beale's Cut was the only way over <a href="Newhall_Pass" title="wikilink">Newhall Pass</a>.</p>
<p><img src="Ridge_Route_concrete_curb.jpg" title="fig:Original stretch of 1919 concrete pavement and curb, pictured circa 2004." alt="Original stretch of 1919 concrete pavement and curb, pictured circa 2004." /> Prior to the 1897 overseas studies, a road of that scale and complexity was considered by engineers to be such a daunting task that there was serious discussion underway in Sacramento about splitting the state in two at the mountains. They believed that to build a road over such a rugged range based on the American highway technology of the day was a nearly impossible task. Even the simplest <a href="logistics" class="uri" title="wikilink">logistics</a> brought up concerns; for example, the initial difficulty in bringing the necessary animals and equipment to the site. Without the Ridge Route, road travel meant skirting the mountains to the west near the coast; road and rail travel could also enter through the <a href="Antelope_Valley" title="wikilink">Antelope Valley</a> to the east and through the <a href="Tehachapi_Pass" title="wikilink">Tehachapi Pass</a>. Either route added as much as an extra day to the trip, greatly driving up the cost of commerce. The Automobile Club of Southern California as well as political interests led the charge to improve the technology, build the highway and preserve the state. So successful was the Ridge Route that it was credited for helping to open the Los Angeles area to <a href="tourism" class="uri" title="wikilink">tourism</a>.</p>
<p><img src="grapevine_1934.jpg" title="fig:View of the Grapevine looking north toward the San Joaquin Valley, 1934." alt="View of the Grapevine looking north toward the San Joaquin Valley, 1934." /> The Ridge Route was completed in 1915 at a cost of <a href="US_dollar" title="wikilink">US$</a>1.2 million—including the 1919 concrete paving—which was covered by a 1909 bond issue that taxpayers didn't pay off until 1965. Originally opened with an unpaved roadbed that was oiled to keep the dust to a minimum, by 1919 the highway was paved with four inch (100 mm) thick <a href="reinforced_concrete" title="wikilink">reinforced concrete</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The highway got its name because it followed the <a href="ridge" title="wikilink">ridgeline</a> of the <a href="San_Gabriel_Mountains" title="wikilink">San Gabriel</a> and <a href="Tehachapi_Mountains" title="wikilink">Tehachapi</a> Mountains. Mostly bypassed by 1933 with the coming of the three-lane &quot;Alternate Ridge Route&quot; which would later be part of <a href="U.S._Highway_99" title="wikilink">U.S. Highway 99</a> (converted to a four-lane expressway by 1947 and severed with the 1970 completion of <a href="Pyramid_Dam" title="wikilink">Pyramid Dam</a>), a 30 mile (48 km) long, 20 foot (6 m) wide stretch of the original Ridge Route between <a href="Castaic,_California" title="wikilink">Castaic</a> just off <a href="Interstate_5" title="wikilink">Interstate 5</a> and <a href="California_State_Highway_138" title="wikilink">Highway 138</a> in <a href="Gorman,_California" title="wikilink">Gorman</a> is paved (except in a few very small stretches) and is still passable. Thanks to the efforts of retired telephone engineer Harrison Scott, roughly seventeen miles (27 km) of that fragment was listed in the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1997.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Scott is also the author of <em>Ridge Route, The Road That United California</em>, one of the most detailed reference works available about the highway.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>The complete road from Castaic to Gorman had 697 curves totaling 39,441 degrees—roughly 110 full circles—with few <a href="guard_rail" title="wikilink">guard rails</a> or <a href="lay-by" title="wikilink">turnouts</a>. Curbs along the sides of the steepest drops kept cars from sliding into the ravines and a <a href="speed_limit" title="wikilink">speed limit</a> of only 15 <a href="mph" class="uri" title="wikilink">mph</a> (24 <a href="km/h" class="uri" title="wikilink">km/h</a>) was strictly enforced.</p>
<p><img src="Beale&#39;s_cut_1937.jpg" title="fig:Beale&#39;s Cut, 1937" alt="Beale&#39;s Cut, 1937" width="225" /> One section, popularly referred to as &quot;<strong>The Grapevine</strong>&quot; (then, as now) was not named for the winding path taken by the road as many believe, but for the wild Cimarron <a href="grape" title="wikilink">grapevines</a> which early <a href="Spain" title="wikilink">Spanish</a> explorers and later 19th Century wagoneers had to hack through.</p>
<p>It was dubbed <em>Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;ada de las uvas,</em> or &quot;Canyon of the Grapes&quot; in 1772 by Don <a href="Pedro_Fages" title="wikilink">Pedro Fages</a>. Don Pedro was a Spanish officer, acting governor of <a href="Alta_California" title="wikilink">Alta California</a> and the first European to travel through the area. These wild grapevines still exist on the hill west of Interstate 5 next to a part of old US 99.</p>
<p>Other named features included the Beale's Cut, Swede's Cut (known also as &quot;Big Cut&quot; and &quot;Culebra Excavation&quot;) and Horseshoe Bend overlooking Liebre Gulch. Beale's Cut is located about 10 miles (16 km) south of Castaic and is now rendered unusable for automobile traffic since the coming of the Newhall Tunnel. Parts of the route ran alongside and overlooked Castaic Creek.</p>
<p><img src="Ridge_Route_Swede&#39;s_Cut.jpg" title="fig:Swede&#39;s Cut looking north, pictured circa 2004." alt="Swede&#39;s Cut looking north, pictured circa 2004." /> Horseshoe Bend was the first paved stretch of the Ridge Route, but was bypassed early in the highway's history and is no longer passable. Except for 110 foot (34 m) deep Swede's Cut which was completed in 1915 and carved through solid rock with the help of steam-powered equipment, the entire route was graded by horse and mule-drawn scrapers. While Swede's Cut is the largest cut on the entire route, it was cut extremely narrow in an effort to save money. As a result of the cut, the soft surrounding rock has held up somewhat poorly.</p>
<h2 id="today">Today</h2>
<p>The route's present end at Highway 138 was the site of the Butterfield Overland Stage stop between Los Angeles and <a href="Bakersfield,_California" title="wikilink">Bakersfield</a>. The remainder of the Ridge Route as well as the town site of Grapevine were covered up by U.S. 99/Interstate 5 with a few fragments of broken pavement still visible from the new highway. What is today a fairly brief drive of less than 30 minutes on Interstate 5 takes an average of three hours plus sightseeing stops on the Ridge Route, even in a modern automobile. So narrow was the Ridge Route in places that there was just enough room for two cars of the period to pass. Drivers of modern wider-bodied automobiles should strongly consider treating these narrow road portions as a shared one-way lane. Inclement weather, including snowstorms at the higher elevations and mudslides during the rainy season not only make the drive nearly impossible, but extremely dangerous as well because no services remain and irreversible damage can occur to the roadway itself. It is strongly recommended to avoid the Ridge Route if the weather is even the least bit threatening.</p>
<p>As of August 2005, the 1915 Ridge Route is officially closed for public access, &quot;You can not drive in, hike in, motorcycle in etc. on the damaged road. <a href="Angeles_National_Forest" title="wikilink">Angeles Forest</a> closed the road because <a href="Pipeline_transport" title="wikilink">pipeline</a> companies are operating heavy equipment on the road to repair their lines damaged during...[the] record rain fall [experienced in Southern California in winter 2005]. Repair crews, for safety reasons, do not want to deal with unauthorized vehicles. The actual 'owner' of the land had been in some dispute, but paperwork is now being finalized and when ownership (of the road) is officially transferred from <a href="Los_Angeles_County" title="wikilink">Los Angeles County</a> to the <a href="U.S._Forest_Service" title="wikilink">U.S. Forest Service</a> they will be able to apply for funds to repair the road.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="tumble-inn">Tumble Inn</h3>
<p><img src="Ridge_Route_TUMBLE_INN_step.jpg" title="fig:The Tumble Inn&#39;s famous step, 2004." alt="The Tumble Inn&#39;s famous step, 2004." width="300" /> One of the best-preserved <a href="ruins" class="uri" title="wikilink">ruins</a> on the Ridge Route is the foundation of the Tumble Inn at about the halfway point of the trip. It is a native stone structure that still bears the words &quot;TUMBLE INN&quot; carved in its top step, just below the foundation floor level. A 1928 motor tour book described the Tumble Inn thus: <em>Rooms, dbl. $2, meals, gas, free camp space, water and rest rooms. A small resort of far-reaching vista.</em> The same could be said of the view today since it extends to the mountains in practically every direction.</p>
<h3 id="national-forest-inn">National Forest Inn</h3>
<p><img src="Ridge_Route_National_Forest_Inn_steps.jpg" title="fig: Remains of the steps to the National Forest Inn, pictured circa 2004." alt=" Remains of the steps to the National Forest Inn, pictured circa 2004." width="200" /> Little remains of this stop once situated on Forest Service land except for cement steps on the west side of the road leading up to the foundation.</p>
<p>A 1926 touring guide indicated that there were <em>nine rooms in cottages, most with running water, from $1 to $2, lunch 75 cents; garage; camp 50 cents.</em> A ranger station and highway repair station completed the complex.</p>
<p><img src="Ridge_Route_National_Forest_Inn_hp.jpg" title="fig:Historical marker and photo across from the National Forest Inn site." alt="Historical marker and photo across from the National Forest Inn site." /> A 1932 pamphlet on highway beautification described it as <em>the sort of <a href="gas_station" title="wikilink">filling station</a> that gets into a national forest and is no addition thereto,</em> a comment which probably alluded to the fact that the National Forest Inn consisted of a series of neat, white <a href="clapboard" class="uri" title="wikilink">clapboard</a> buildings instead of log structures of the type prevalent throughout the forest.</p>
<p>Above this structure on a nearby hill are an unused cement-lined <a href="reservoir_(water)" title="wikilink">reservoir</a> believed to have been built for fire control as well as the foundation remains of an airplane beacon.</p>
<p>The National Forest Inn was destroyed on <a href="October_20" title="wikilink">October 20</a>, <a href="1932" class="uri" title="wikilink">1932</a> by a fire which originated in the building's garage.</p>
<h3 id="sandbergs-summit-hotel">Sandberg's Summit Hotel</h3>
<p><img src="Ridge_Route_Sandberg_Inn_damage.jpg" title="fig:Detail of collapsing foundation of Sandberg&#39;s Summit Hotel, circa 2004." alt="Detail of collapsing foundation of Sandberg&#39;s Summit Hotel, circa 2004." /> All that remains of the Ridge Route's finest accommodation, Sandberg's Summit Hotel are its extensive rock wall work below the main floor, cement foundations and the floor and rear wall of what was once an auto repair facility. The facility burned down in 1961 during efforts to renovate the building for use as a <a href="youth_hostel" title="wikilink">youth hostel</a>. Sandberg's was notable for its many amenities, including both running water and indoor plumbing which made it the stop of choice for the well-heeled traveler, and the proprietors made that quite clear. A sign in front of the hotel said, &quot;NO TRUCKERS OR DOGS ALLOWED.&quot; Sandberg's was also the stuff of road lore as unsubstantiated rumors of illegal <a href="gambling" class="uri" title="wikilink">gambling</a> and even <a href="prostitution" class="uri" title="wikilink">prostitution</a> abounded. The highest point of the Ridge Route was just south of Sandberg's on the <a href="Los_Angeles_County" title="wikilink">Los Angeles County</a> side at an elevation of 4223'/1287 m.</p>
<h3 id="reservoir-summit">Reservoir Summit</h3>
<p><img src="Ridge_Route_Reservoir_Summit.jpg" title="fig:Ruins of Reservoir Summit, pictured circa 2004." alt="Ruins of Reservoir Summit, pictured circa 2004." /> Reservoir Summit took its name from the large reservoir that once provided water during construction of the highway. The Reservoir Inn travel stop consisted of a very small garage, a restaurant that hung over the side of a cliff, rest rooms and an auto camp. Harrison Scott describes the Reservoir Inn as &quot;green with a screened porch. It had a lunch counter with three or four tables. It was a high-class, popular restaurant with men waiters in solid white uniforms. Truckers were welcome.&quot; Today, all that remains are parts of the reservoir itself.</p>
<h3 id="tire-tracks">Tire tracks</h3>
<p>Though a great deal of the route had been daylighted (widened) and paved in asphalt by the mid-1920s, much of the 1919 concrete pavement remains intact. In some areas, <a href="Model_T" title="wikilink">Model T</a> tire tracks can still be seen, left decades ago in the still-soft concrete.</p>
