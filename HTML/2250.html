<p>As a prominent businessman he had served two terms on the Wilmington City Council, had served on the Public Utilities and Unemployment Insurance Commission, and had turned down an offer to run for Mayor of Wilmington. After reluctantly agreeing to run, he was elected Governor of Delaware in 1936, defeating Republican Harry L. Cannon, and Isaac D. Short, a Republican running as an Independent. He served one term as Governor from [January 19, 1937 until January 21, 1941.</p>
<p>McMullen was the first Democratic Governor in 36 years and throughout his term was frustrated with his inability to replace his political opponents in state government. As his term was during the latter part of the Great Depression, public works projects were going on throughout the state, including the opening of the Roosevelt Inlet at <a href="Lewes,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Lewes</a>, a new bridge over Indian River Inlet and a couple of new stations for the State Police.</p>
