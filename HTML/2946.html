<p><strong>Typhoon Pongsona</strong> (international designation: <strong><em>0226</em></strong>, JTWC designation: <strong><em>31W</em></strong>) was the last <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">typhoon</a> of the <a href="2002_Pacific_typhoon_season" title="wikilink">2002 Pacific typhoon season</a>, and was the costliest disaster in 2002 in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The name &quot;Pongsona&quot; was contributed by <a href="North_Korea" title="wikilink">North Korea</a> and is the <a href="Korean_language" title="wikilink">Korean</a> name for the <a href="Impatiens_balsamina" title="wikilink">garden balsam</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Pongsona developed out of an area of disturbed weather on <a href="December_2" title="wikilink">December 2</a>, and steadily intensified to reach typhoon status on <a href="December_5" title="wikilink">December 5</a>. On <a href="December_8" title="wikilink">December 8</a> it passed through Guam and the <a href="Northern_Marianas_Islands" title="wikilink">Northern Marianas Islands</a> while near its peak 10-min winds of 175 km/h (110 mph). It ultimately turned to the northeast, weakened, and became extratropical on <a href="December_11" title="wikilink">December 11</a>.</p>
<p>Considered by some to be the worst typhoon to have struck <a href="Guam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guam</a>, Pongsona produced strong wind gusts peaking at 278 km/h (173 mph), which left the entire island without power and destroyed about 1,300 houses. With strong building standards and experience from repeated typhoon strikes, there were no fatalities directly related to Pongsona, though there was one indirect death from flying glass. Damage on the island totaled over $700 million (2002 USD, $800 million 2007 USD), making Pongsona among the five costliest typhoons on the island. The typhoon also caused heavy damage on <a href="Rota" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rota</a> and elsewhere in the <a href="Northern_Marianas_Islands" title="wikilink">Northern Marianas Islands</a>, and as a result of its impact, the name was retired.</p>

<h2 id="preparations">Preparations</h2>
<p>The <a href="Guam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guam</a> <a href="National_Weather_Service" title="wikilink">National Weather Service</a> issued a <a href="tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" title="wikilink">Tropical Storm Watch</a> for the <a href="Marshall_Islands" title="wikilink">Marshall Islands</a> shortly after Pongsona developed into a tropical storm, and a day later watches were issued for <a href="Chuuk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chuuk</a>. On <a href="December_5" title="wikilink">December 5</a>, the service issued tropical storm warnings for all of the <a href="Federal_States_of_Micronesia" title="wikilink">Federal States of Micronesia</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> As Pongsona became a typhoon, the Guam National Weather Service issued a Typhoon Watch for <a href="Guam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guam</a>, <a href="Rota" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rota</a>, <a href="Saipan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saipan</a>, and <a href="Tinian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tinian</a>, which was upgraded to a Typhoon Warning about 23 hours prior to the onset of typhoon-force winds. Typhoon warnings were also issued for the unpopulated island of <a href="Agrihan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Agrihan</a>. By one day prior to the typhoon moving through the <a href="Mariana_Islands" title="wikilink">Mariana Islands</a>, local weather offices predicted Pongsona to pass well east of the area. Despite a more westward motion than anticipated, forecasts remained stagnant until the morning of <a href="December_8" title="wikilink">December 8</a>, when two lead forecasters reluctantly predicted much greater threat to the Mariana Islands. As a result, many citizens felt they were unprepared and insufficiently warned for the typhoon.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Nine shelters throughout the Northern Mariana Islands were opened to accommodate families needing assistance.

<p>Early in its duration, Pongsona first affected <a href="Pohnpei" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pohnpei</a> as a tropical storm. There, it produced heavy rains and gusty winds, though little damage was reported. Later, it brought tropical storm force winds to <a href="Chuuk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chuuk</a>.

<h3 id="guam">Guam</h3>
<p><img src="Typhoon_Pongsona_damage_Guam.jpg" title="fig:Damage from Pongsona on Guam" alt="Damage from Pongsona on Guam" width="250" /> Typhoon Pongsona maintained a 65 km (40 mi) wide <a href="eye_(cyclone)" title="wikilink">eye</a> upon crossing the northern, populated portion of the island of <a href="Guam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guam</a>; the <a href="Andersen_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Andersen Air Force Base</a> was in the eye for two hours. Winds from the typhoon peaked at 232 km/h (144 mph) with gusts peaking at 278 km/h (173 mph); gusts of at least 160 km/h (100 mph) affected the entire island. The lowest pressure on the island was 935 <a href="mbar" class="uri" title="wikilink">mbar</a> (27.61 inHg), making Pongsona the third most intense typhoon to strike Guam; it is behind only a typhoon in 1900 (926 mbar) and <a href="Typhoon_Karen" title="wikilink">Typhoon Karen</a> of 1962 (932 mbar).<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Strong winds from the typhoon caused communications on the island to fail, resulting in the National Weather Service in <a href="Honolulu,_Hawaii" title="wikilink">Honolulu, Hawaii</a> providing backup support to Guam by temporarily issuing warnings and advisories. The winds also caused many anemometers near the northern coastline to fail.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The winds collapsed several walls at the <a href="Guam_Memorial_Hospital" title="wikilink">Guam Memorial Hospital</a>, resulting in major damage throughout the northern two-thirds of the facility and several units being shut down. Several hotels, churches, and schools received moderate damage, and the <a href="Antonio_B._Won_Pat_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport</a> received damage to navigation equipment. The winds greatly damaged 715 power poles and 513 transformers, with about $52 million in electrical damage reported (2002 USD, $59 million 2007 USD);<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> the entire island was left without power and phone service.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Typhoon Pongsona also left 65% of the island's water wells inoperable,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> with most of Guam left without water service following the storm.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Officials estimate the typhoon destroyed 1,300 homes, with an additional 1,825 severely damaged and 4,800 receiving minor damage.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Pongsona_Guam_damage.jpg" title="fig:Damage in Guam from typhoon" alt="Damage in Guam from typhoon" width="200" /> Tracking slowly across the center of the island, the intense inner <a href="tropical_cyclone#Structure" title="wikilink">rainbands</a> dropped heavy rainfall which peaked at 650 mm (25.61 in) at the <a href="University_of_Guam" title="wikilink">University of Guam</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The precipitation led to record river flow on the <a href="List_of_rivers_in_Guam" title="wikilink">Pago and Asan Rivers</a>; overflown rivers caused damage to some roads and bridges. The rainfall also caused extensive flooding in several villages. Pongsona produced a <a href="storm_surge" title="wikilink">storm surge</a> of up to 6 m (20 feet) was reported at some locations, with 3–4 m (9–13 ft) recorded near the eyewall. Considerable storm surge flooding occurred from <a href="Tumon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tumon</a> southward to <a href="Piti,_Guam" title="wikilink">Piti</a>, leaving some buildings on the west coast of the island flooded with 1 m (4 ft). The combination of strong storm surge and rough waves caused considerable beach erosion, causing severe coastal damage.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>Across Guam, damage totaled over $700 million (2003 <a href="USD" class="uri" title="wikilink">USD</a>, $800 million 2007 USD), placing it among the five costliest typhoons on the island. Pongsona resulted in 193 injuries, as reported by the Guam Department of Health; most were lacerations and fractures caused by flying glass and other debris. There was one indirect death attributed to the storm, when a 71-year old woman was cut by flying glass and subsequently suffered a fatal heart attack. Medical help could not reach her due to the intensity of the storm. As the eyes of 6 typhoons had passed over the island in the previous ten years, officials in Guam enacted strong building standards, keeping deaths and injuries to a minimum. The typhoon was considered the worst typhoon to ever strike the island due to the large eye affecting most of the population.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

The combination of winds and other effects from the typhoon destroyed 114 houses, severely damaged 154, and caused minor damage to 306; on the island, about 200 families were left homeless. The typhoon produced a <a href="storm_surge" title="wikilink">storm surge</a> of 22 feet at <a href="Songsong" title="wikilink">Songsong Village</a>, which crossed about 80% of the southwestern peninsula on Rota. The surge caused moderate beach erosion on the island, and destroyed a fuel pier and a loading pipeline. Additionally, the typhoon caused severe crop damage on the island. In all, the typhoon caused 10 minor injuries on Rota, and resulted in over $30 million in damage (2002 USD, $34 million 2007 USD).<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>During the height of the typhoon at <a href="Apra_Harbor" title="wikilink">Cabras Island</a> on Guam, a gasoline tank caught fire, believed to be from friction caused by extremely high winds running through its ventilation system. The tank exploded, sending its lid airborne and spreading the fire to other nearby tanks. The proximity of the tanks as well as low water pressure hampered firefighting efforts, and the fire was extinguished five days later; it resulted in three destroyed gasoline tanks with two more caught on fire.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
