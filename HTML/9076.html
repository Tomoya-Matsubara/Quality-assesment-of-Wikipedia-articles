<h3 id="rapes">Rapes</h3>
<p>Austin J. App's book, <em>Ravishing the Women of Conquered Europe</em>, claims that some 2,000,000 German women were raped in 1945, not only by members of the <a href="Red_Army" title="wikilink">Red Army</a> but also by American and British troops.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> According to writer Sean Longden, although far from the scale of those committed by the Soviets, rapes of local women were a common feature among British troops in Germany. Even elderly women were targeted. The <a href="Royal_Military_Police" title="wikilink">Royal Military Police</a> tended to turn a blind eye towards abuse of German prisoners and civilians but rape was a major issue for them. Some officers reportedly treated this behaviour with leniency.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Many rapes resulted from alcohol or post-traumatic stress, but there were also instances of premeditated attacks, such as the assault on three German women in the town of Neustadt am R&lt;U+00FC&gt;bemberge and the attempted gang-rape of two local girls at gunpoint in the village of Oyle, near <a href="Nienburg,_Lower_Saxony" title="wikilink">Nienburg</a>, which ended in the death of one of the women when a soldier (it is not clear if unintentionally or otherwise) discharged his gun, striking her in the neck.

<h3 id="bombing-of-dresden">Bombing of Dresden</h3>

<p>The British, with other allied nations (mainly the U.S.) carried out air raids against enemy cities during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, including the <a href="Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II#Allegations_that_it_was_a_war_crime" title="wikilink">bombing of the German city of Dresden</a>, which killed more than 25,000 people. While &quot;no agreement, treaty, convention or any other instrument governing the protection of the civilian population or civilian property&quot; from aerial attack was adopted before the war,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> the <a href="Hague_Conventions_of_1899_and_1907" title="wikilink">Hague Conventions</a> did prohibit the bombardment of undefended towns. Allied forces inquiry concluded that an air attack on <a href="Dresden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dresden</a> was militarily justified on the grounds the city was defended.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

He further argues that there was a strong <em><a href="prima_facie" title="wikilink">prima facie</a></em> for trying Winston Churchill among others and that there is theoretical case that he could have been found guilty. &quot;This should be a sobering thought. If, however it is also a startling one, this is probably less the result of widespread understanding of the nuance of international law and more because in the popular mind 'war criminal', like 'paedophile' or 'terrorist', has developed into a moral rather than a legal categorisation.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

This more remote camp near Garissa, eastern Kenya, was reserved for the most uncooperative of the detainees. They often refused, even when threats of force were made, to join in the colonial &quot;rehabilitation process&quot; or perform manual labour or obey colonial orders. The camp commandant outlined a plan that would force 88 of the detainees to bend to work. On 3 March 1959, the camp commandant put this plan into action &lt;U+2013&gt; as a result, 11 detainees were clubbed to death by guards.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> 77 surviving detainees sustained serious permanent injuries.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The British government accepts that the colonial administration tortured detainees, but denies liability.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
