<p><strong>M-10</strong> is a <a href="Michigan_State_Trunkline_Highway_System" title="wikilink">state trunkline highway</a> in the <a href="Metro_Detroit" title="wikilink">Metro Detroit</a> area of Michigan in the United States. The southernmost portion follows <a href="Jefferson_Avenue_(Detroit)" title="wikilink">Jefferson Avenue</a> in downtown <a href="Detroit,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Detroit</a>, and the southern terminus is at the intersection of Jefferson and <a href="M-3_(Michigan_highway)" title="wikilink">M-3</a> (Randolph Street) next to the entrance to the <a href="Detroit&lt;U+2013&gt;Windsor_Tunnel" title="wikilink">Detroit&lt;U+2013&gt;Windsor Tunnel</a>. The northern terminus is in <a href="West_Bloomfield_Township,_Michigan" title="wikilink">West Bloomfield Township</a> at the intersection with Orchard Lake Road. The highway has several names as it runs through residential and commercial areas of the west side of Detroit and into the suburb of <a href="Southfield,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Southfield</a>. It is called the <strong>John C. Lodge Freeway</strong>, <strong>The Lodge</strong>, <strong>James Couzens Highway</strong> and <strong>Northwestern Highway</strong>.</p>
<p>M-10 was built in segments through the late 1950s and early 1960s. It carried several different names before the entire route was finally officially named the John C. Lodge Freeway in 1987. The <a href="freeway" class="uri" title="wikilink">freeway</a> has carried a few other highway designations. The southern segment was part of <a href="U.S._Route_12_in_Michigan" title="wikilink">US Highway 12</a> (US 12) and the whole thing was later renumbered <a href="Interstate_696_Business_(Detroit,_Michigan)" title="wikilink">Business Spur Interstate 696</a> (BS I-696). From 1970 until 1986, it was part of <a href="U.S._Route_10_in_Michigan" title="wikilink">US 10</a>, and the freeway has been M-10 since. The non-freeway segment that runs between <a href="Interstate_696" title="wikilink">I-696</a> in Southfield and Orchard Lake Road was previously numbered <strong>M-4</strong>. M-10 was named after <a href="John_C._Lodge" title="wikilink">John C. Lodge</a>, an influential Detroiter and <a href="Mayor_of_Detroit" title="wikilink">Mayor of Detroit</a> from 1927&lt;U+2013&gt;28.</p>

<p>In 1919, the state numbered its highways for the first time.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In the initial allocation of numbers, M-10 was assigned to a highway that started at the Ohio state line south of <a href="Monroe,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Monroe</a>, ran northeasterly along Telegraph Road into <a href="Dearborn,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Dearborn</a> and turned easterly into <a href="Detroit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Detroit</a>.

Then M-10 ran along the <a href="Saginaw_Bay" title="wikilink">Saginaw Bay</a> to <a href="Standish,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Standish</a> and turned to follow the <a href="Lake_Huron" title="wikilink">Lake Huron</a> shoreline, with some substantial deviations inland. The highway generally followed the lakeshore as far north as <a href="Alpena,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Alpena</a> and <a href="Rogers_City,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Rogers City</a>, and from there, M-10 ran due west through <a href="Onaway,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Onaway</a> before turning north into <a href="Cheboygan,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Cheboygan</a>. The last section of M-10 followed the Lake Huron shoreline to <a href="Mackinaw_City,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Mackinaw City</a>, where it terminated.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> This designation lasted until November 11, 1926, when the <a href="United_States_Numbered_Highway_System" title="wikilink">United States Numbered Highway System</a> was created.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In Michigan's initial allocation of highways, four new designations replaced M-10: <a href="U.S._Route_24_in_Michigan" title="wikilink">US 24</a> from the state line north to Dearborn, <a href="U.S._Route_112" title="wikilink">US 112</a> between Dearborn and Detroit, <a href="U.S._Route_10_in_Michigan" title="wikilink">US 10</a> from Detroit to Saginaw, and <a href="U.S._Route_23_in_Michigan" title="wikilink">US 23</a> from Saginaw to Mackinaw City.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> At the time, no M-10 designation was reassigned to any other roads.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="Michigan_Department_of_Transportation" title="wikilink">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT) petitioned the <a href="American_Association_of_State_Highway_and_Transportation_Officials" title="wikilink">American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials</a> in the mid-1980s to truncate US 10 to <a href="Bay_City,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Bay City</a>. The request was approved on October 11, 1985,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> and the signage was changed the next year. After the change, the Lodge Freeway was redesignated M-10. The non-freeway Northwestern Highway, until then designated M-4, was also renumbered as M-10. The southernmost portion of the Lodge Freeway was also initially redesignated as a portion of <a href="Interstate_375_Business_(Detroit,_Michigan)" title="wikilink">BS I-375</a> from I-75 south.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> By the next year however, the southern end of M-10 was moved to the corner of Jefferson and Randolph, placing all of the Lodge Freeway as part of M-10.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>Starting in 1924, officials in southeastern Michigan proposed building a highway from Detroit to run northwesterly across the state to <a href="Ludington,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Ludington</a>, bisecting the angle created by <a href="Woodward_Avenue" title="wikilink">Woodward</a> and <a href="Grand_River_Avenue" title="wikilink">Grand River</a> avenues. This roadway was named Northwestern Highway when it was built in 1929 to an endpoint at 14 Mile Road.

<p>The freeway segment northwest of Wyoming Avenue to the county line was previously known as James Couzens Highway after the street it replaced. That street was named after the death of <a href="James_J._Couzens" title="wikilink">James J. Couzens</a>. Couzens was a former Commissioner of Detroit's <a href="Department_of_Street_Railways" title="wikilink">Department of Street Railways</a> from 1913 through 1915, after which he served as Police Commissioner from 1916 until 1918.

He later served as Mayor of Detroit in 1918&lt;U+2013&gt;1919 before returned to the City Common Council from 1932 to 1947. He was then elected to the Wayne County Board of Supervisors from 1948 until 1950. In total, he held elective office longer than anyone in city history. He died on February 6, 1950, and the future Lodge Freeway was named in his honor on January 20, 1953.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The entire freeway, including segments previously named for James Couzens and the Northwestern Highway was named the John C.
