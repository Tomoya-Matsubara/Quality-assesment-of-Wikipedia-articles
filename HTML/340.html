<p><strong>Pink Floyd</strong> were an English <a href="Rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a> band who earned international recognition for their <a href="psychedelic_rock" title="wikilink">psychedelic rock</a> music in the late 1960s, and for their <a href="progressive_rock" title="wikilink">progressive rock</a> music from the 1970s onward. Their work is marked by the use of philosophical lyrics, <a href="Acoustics" title="wikilink">sonic experimentation</a>, innovative <a href="album_art" title="wikilink">album art</a>, and elaborate <a href="Pink_Floyd_live_performances" title="wikilink">live shows</a>. One of rock music's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful acts, the group have sold over 200 million albums worldwide, including 74.5 million certified units in the United States, making them one of the <a href="list_of_best-selling_music_artists" title="wikilink">best-selling music artists</a> of all time.</p>
<p>Pink Floyd were formed in 1965, and originally consisted of university students <a href="Roger_Waters" title="wikilink">Roger Waters</a>, <a href="Nick_Mason" title="wikilink">Nick Mason</a>, <a href="Richard_Wright_(musician)" title="wikilink">Richard Wright</a>, and <a href="Syd_Barrett" title="wikilink">Syd Barrett</a>. The group were a popular fixture on London's underground music scene, and under Barrett's leadership released two charting singles, &quot;<a href="Arnold_Layne" title="wikilink">Arnold Layne</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="See_Emily_Play" title="wikilink">See Emily Play</a>&quot;, and a successful debut album, <em><a href="The_Piper_at_the_Gates_of_Dawn" title="wikilink">The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</a></em>. In 1968, guitarist and singer <a href="David_Gilmour" title="wikilink">David Gilmour</a> joined the line-up. Barrett was soon removed, due to his increasingly erratic behaviour. Following Barrett's departure, bass player and singer Roger Waters became the lyricist and dominant figure in the band, which went on to achieve worldwide critical and commercial success with the <a href="concept_albums" title="wikilink">concept albums</a> <em><a href="The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon" title="wikilink">The Dark Side of the Moon</a></em>, <em><a href="Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_album)" title="wikilink">Wish You Were Here</a></em>, <em><a href="Animals_(album)" title="wikilink">Animals</a></em>, and <em><a href="The_Wall" title="wikilink">The Wall</a></em>.</p>
<p>Wright left the band in 1979, and Waters in 1985, but Gilmour and Mason (rejoined by Wright) continued recording and touring under the name Pink Floyd. Waters used legal means to try to keep them from using the name, declaring Pink Floyd a spent force, but the parties reached an out-of-court settlement allowing Gilmour, Mason and Wright to continue as Pink Floyd. The band again enjoyed worldwide successes with <em><a href="A_Momentary_Lapse_of_Reason" title="wikilink">A Momentary Lapse of Reason</a></em> (1987) and <em><a href="The_Division_Bell" title="wikilink">The Division Bell</a></em> (1994), and Waters continued as a solo musician, releasing three studio albums. Although for some years relations between Waters and the remaining three members were sour, the band reformed in 2005 for a final one-off performance at <a href="Live_8" title="wikilink">Live 8</a>.</p>

<h4 id="formation">Formation</h4>
<p>Nick Mason and Roger Waters first met while studying architecture at the <a href="University_of_Westminster" title="wikilink">Regent Street Polytechnic</a> in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The pair first played together in a band formed by Keith Noble and <a href="Clive_Metcalfe" title="wikilink">Clive Metcalfe</a>, with Noble's sister Sheilagh. Fellow student Richard Wright joined later, and the band became a sextet, taking the name Sigma 6.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Waters initially played rhythm guitar before switching to bass, and Wright's girlfriend was a regular guest artist. The band performed initially during private functions, rehearsing in a <a href="tearoom" class="uri" title="wikilink">tearoom</a> in the basement of Regent Street Polytechnic. They played songs by <a href="The_Searchers_(band)" title="wikilink">The Searchers</a>, and also material written by fellow student Ken Chapman, who became their manager and songwriter.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In September 1963 Mason and Waters moved into the lower flat of Stanhope Gardens, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the Regent Street Polytechnic. Leonard was a designer of light machines (perforated discs spun by electric motors to cast patterns of lights on the walls){{#tag:ref|These would be demonstrated in an early edition of <em><a href="Tomorrow&#39;s_World" title="wikilink">Tomorrow's World</a></em>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} and for a time played keyboard alongside them, using the front room of the flat for rehearsals.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Mason later moved out of the flat, while accomplished guitar player <a href="Bob_Klose" title="wikilink">Bob Klose</a> moved in. Sigma 6 changed their name on several occasions, from the Megadeaths, to the Architectural Abdabs, and then to The Tea Set.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own band,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> but in 1964 Klose and Waters were joined at Stanhope Gardens by <a href="Syd_Barrett" title="wikilink">Syd Barrett</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Then aged 17,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Barrett had arrived in London in late 1963, to study at <a href="Camberwell_College_of_Art" title="wikilink">Camberwell College of Art</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Waters and Barrett were childhood friends; the bassist had often visited Barrett as he played guitar at his mother's house.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="as-the-pink-floyd-sound">As The Pink Floyd Sound</h4>
<p>With the Tea Set lacking Noble and Metcalfe's vocals, Klose introduced the band to Chris Dennis, a technician with the <a href="Royal_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Air Force</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> It was during Dennis's tenure that the band was first referred to as The Pink Floyd Sound,{{#tag:ref|The sources used in this article suggest different dates for the first billing of this name, and therefore this article is purposely ambiguous.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} created by Barrett on the spur of the moment when he discovered that another band, also named the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs. The name is derived from the given names of two <a href="blues" class="uri" title="wikilink">blues</a> musicians whose records Barrett had in his collection, <a href="Pink_Anderson" title="wikilink">Pink Anderson</a> and <a href="Floyd_Council" title="wikilink">Floyd Council</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Dennis was posted to <a href="Bahrain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahrain</a>, thrusting Barrett into the spotlight as frontman.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> They first performed in a recording studio in December 1964, minus the presence of Wright, who was taking a break from his studies. Through one of his friends, who let them use some &quot;down time&quot; for free, they managed to secure recording time at a studio in West Hampstead. This four-song session became the Tea Set's first demo tape, and included the R&amp;B classic &quot;I'm A King Bee&quot;, two Syd Barrett originals: &quot;Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Lucy Leave&quot;, and &quot;Double O Bo&quot;, a group-composition which&lt;U+2014&gt;according to Mason&lt;U+2014&gt;was &quot;Bo Diddley meets the 007 theme.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The Pink Floyd Sound became the resident band at the Countdown Club near <a href="Kensington_High_Street" title="wikilink">Kensington High Street</a> in London, where from late night until early morning they played three sets of 90 minutes. According to Mason, this period &quot;&lt;U+2026&gt; was the beginning of a realisation that songs could be extended with lengthy solos.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> An audition for <a href="ITV" class="uri" title="wikilink">ITV</a>'s <em><a href="Ready_Steady_Go!" title="wikilink">Ready Steady Go!</a></em> soon followed (they were invited by the programme's producers to return the following week), as did another club, and two rock contests. At the behest of his father and college tutors, Bob Klose left in 1965,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and Barrett took over on lead guitar.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Playing mostly <a href="rhythm_and_blues" title="wikilink">rhythm and blues</a> songs, they began to receive paid bookings, including one for a performance at the <a href="Marquee_Club" title="wikilink">Marquee Club</a> in March 1966, where they were watched by <a href="Peter_Jenner" title="wikilink">Peter Jenner</a>. A lecturer at the <a href="London_School_of_Economics" title="wikilink">London School of Economics</a>, Jenner was impressed by the acoustic effects Barrett and Wright created,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> and with his business partner and friend <a href="Andrew_King_(music_manager)" title="wikilink">Andrew King</a> became their manager.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Although the pair had little experience of the <a href="music_industry" title="wikilink">music industry</a>, they used inherited money to set up <a href="Blackhill_Enterprises" title="wikilink">Blackhill Enterprises</a>, and purchased new instruments and equipment for the band, including a <a href="The_Selmer_Company" title="wikilink">Selmer</a> PA system.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Under their guidance, at venues including All Saints Hall and The Marquee, the band became part of London's <a href="underground_music" title="wikilink">underground music</a> scene.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Hapshash-UFO.jpg" title="fig:A Hapshash and the Coloured Coat poster for Pink Floyd at the UFO Club" alt="A Hapshash and the Coloured Coat poster for Pink Floyd at the UFO Club" /> While performing at the Countdown Club the band had experimented with long instrumental excursions, and they began to expand upon these with rudimentary but visually powerful light shows, projected by coloured slides and domestic lights.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> To celebrate the launch of the <a href="London_Free_School" title="wikilink">London Free School</a>'s magazine <em><a href="International_Times" title="wikilink">International Times</a></em>, they performed in front of a 2,000-strong crowd at the opening of <a href="The_Roundhouse" title="wikilink">The Roundhouse</a>, attended by celebrities including <a href="Alexander_Trocchi" title="wikilink">Alexander Trocchi</a>, <a href="Paul_McCartney" title="wikilink">Paul McCartney</a>, and <a href="Marianne_Faithfull" title="wikilink">Marianne Faithfull</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Jenner and King's diverse array of social connections helped gain the band important coverage in <em><a href="The_Financial_Times" title="wikilink">The Financial Times</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Sunday_Times" title="wikilink">The Sunday Times</a></em>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Their relationship with Blackhill Enterprises was strengthened when they became full partners, each holding an unprecedented one-sixth share,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and by October 1966 their set included more of their own material.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> They performed at venues such as the <a href="Commonwealth_Institute#The_Commonwealth_Institute_1962.E2.80.932002" title="wikilink">Commonwealth Institute</a>,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> but were not universally popular; following a performance at a Catholic youth club the owner refused to pay, a stance which the magistrate agreed with, claiming that the band's performance &quot;wasn't music&quot;.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> This was not the only occasion on which they encountered such opinions, but they were better received at the <a href="UFO_Club" title="wikilink">UFO Club</a> in London.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Barrett's performances were reportedly exuberant, &quot;&lt;U+2026&gt; leaping around and the madness, and the kind of improvisation he was doing &lt;U+2026&gt; he was inspired. He would constantly manage to get past his limitations and into areas that were very, very interesting. Which none of the others could do.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The often drug-addled audience was receptive to the music they played, but the band remained drug-free &lt;U+2014&gt;&quot;We were out of it, not on acid, but out of the loop, stuck in the dressing room at UFO.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="David_Gilmour" title="wikilink">David Gilmour</a> was already acquainted with Barrett, having in the early 1960s studied modern languages at Cambridge Tech, while the latter studied art.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The two had performed at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and busked their way around the south of France.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> In 1965, while a member of <a href="Joker&#39;s_Wild_(band)" title="wikilink">Joker's Wild</a>, Gilmour had watched The Tea Set,<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> and two years later the band asked him to become the fifth member of Pink Floyd. Barrett had recently suggested adding four new members, in the words of Roger Waters, &quot;two freaks he'd met somewhere.

<p>In a demonstration of his frustration at being effectively sidelined, Barrett tried to teach the band a new song, &quot;<a href="List_of_unreleased_Pink_Floyd_songs#Have_You_Got_It,_Yet?" title="wikilink">Have You Got It Yet?</a>&quot;, but changed the structure on each performance&lt;U+2014&gt;making it impossible for them to learn.

<p>For their second studio album, the band returned with Smith to Abbey Road Studios. Several songs featuring Barrett had already been laid down, including &quot;<a href="Jugband_Blues" title="wikilink">Jugband Blues</a>&quot; (his final contribution to their discography).

Encouraged by Smith, some of the new material was recorded at their homes, continuing the type of experimentation seen on <em>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</em>.

<p>Neither Waters nor Mason could read music, so to create the album's title track, &quot;<a href="A_Saucerful_of_Secrets_(song)" title="wikilink">A Saucerful of Secrets</a>&quot;, they invented their own system of notation; Gilmour later described this as looking &quot;&lt;U+2026&gt; like an architectural diagram&quot;.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> <em><a href="A_Saucerful_of_Secrets" title="wikilink">A Saucerful of Secrets</a></em> was released to mixed reviews in June that year; <em><a href="Record_Mirror" title="wikilink">Record Mirror</a></em> urged listeners to &quot;forget it as background music to a party&quot;,<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> and <a href="John_Peel" title="wikilink">John Peel</a> claimed that the album was &quot;&lt;U+2026&gt; like a religious experience &lt;U+2026&gt;&quot;.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> <em><a href="NME" class="uri" title="wikilink">NME</a></em>, however, viewed the title track as &quot;&lt;U+2026&gt; long and boring, and has little to warrant its monotonous direction&quot;.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The album cover was designed by <a href="Storm_Thorgerson" title="wikilink">Storm Thorgerson</a> and <a href="Aubrey_Powell_(designer)" title="wikilink">Aubrey Powell</a> of <a href="Hipgnosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hipgnosis</a>.{{#tag:ref|Storm Thorgerson attended the same school, about the same time as Waters and Barrett.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Upon the album's release Pink Floyd performed at the first free <a href="List_of_concerts_in_Hyde_Park" title="wikilink">Hyde Park concert</a> (organised by Blackhill Enterprises), alongside <a href="Roy_Harper" title="wikilink">Roy Harper</a> and <a href="Jethro_Tull_(band)" title="wikilink">Jethro Tull</a>.

The band also worked on the soundtrack for a proposed cartoon series called <em><a href="Rollo_(cartoon)" title="wikilink">Rollo</a></em>, but a lack of funds meant that it was never produced.

<p><em>Ummagumma</em> presented a departure from their previous work, containing barely any new compositions. Released as a double-LP on EMI's <a href="Harvest_Records" title="wikilink">Harvest</a> label, the first two sides contained live performances, recorded at Manchester College of Commerce and at Mother's Club in Birmingham.

<p><img src="Roger_waters_leeds_1970.jpg" title="fig:Roger Waters performing with Pink Floyd, at Leeds University in 1970" alt="Roger Waters performing with Pink Floyd, at Leeds University in 1970" /> <em>Ummagumma</em> was quickly followed by 1970's <em><a href="Atom_Heart_Mother" title="wikilink">Atom Heart Mother</a></em>. The band's previous LPs were recorded using a <a href="Multitrack_recording" title="wikilink">four-track</a> system, but <em>Atom Heart Mother</em> was their first eight-track album.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> An early version was premi&lt;U+00E8&gt;red in France in January, but disagreements over its direction prompted the arrival of Ron Geesin. Geesin worked for about a month to improve the score, but with little creative input from the band production was troublesome; it was eventually completed with the aid of John Aldiss. Norman Smith was credited as an executive producer, and the album marked his final contribution to the band's discography.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Gilmour is generally dismissive of <em>Atom Heart Mother</em>, once describing it as &quot;a load of rubbish&quot;,<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> although in 2001 he said it &quot;was a good thing to have attempted, but I don't really think the attempt comes off that well&quot;.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Waters was similarly critical, once claiming that he would not mind if it were &quot;thrown into the dustbin and never listened to by anyone ever again.&quot;<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> <em>Atom Heart Mother</em> was hugely successful in the UK,<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> and was premi&lt;U+00E8&gt;red at the Bath Festival on 27 June 1970.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1971 they took second place in a poll of readers by <em>Melody Maker</em> (behind Emerson, Lake and Palmer), and for the first time were making a profit. The theft in <a href="New_Orleans" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a> of equipment worth about $40,000 almost crippled the band's finances, but although the local police were unhelpful, hours after the band notified the <a href="FBI" class="uri" title="wikilink">FBI</a> the equipment was returned. Mason and Wright became fathers and bought homes in London while Gilmour, still single, moved to a 19th-century farm in Essex.

<p><em>Meddle</em>{{'}}s production was spread over a considerable period of time; the band recorded in the first half of April, but in the latter half played at Doncaster and Norwich before returning to record at the end of the month.

<p>The group's other releases around this period, <em>More</em> and <em><a href="Zabriskie_Point_(album)" title="wikilink">Zabriskie Point</a></em>, were soundtracks, and <em>Atom Heart Mother</em> was influenced as much by Ron Geesin and the session artists as it was by the band.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> The band again worked with Barbet Schroeder on the film <em>La Vall&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</em>, for which a soundtrack album was released, called <em><a href="Obscured_by_Clouds" title="wikilink">Obscured by Clouds</a></em>.

Their deal with EMI for unlimited studio time in return for a reduced percentage of sales had expired, and they set about converting the building into a recording studio and storage facility. The studio would be on the ground floor, with the storage facility above, with a hoist to move the band's equipment in and out of the building. The top floor became an office, equipped with a <a href="pool_table" title="wikilink">pool table</a>. The band also envisaged hiring their equipment out, but the hire business was unsuccessful and would later be taken over by <a href="Brian_Grant" title="wikilink">Brian Grant</a> and Robbie Williams. <a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> The studio was more successful.

<p><em>Animals</em> was born from another Waters concept, borrowed from <a href="George_Orwell" title="wikilink">George Orwell</a>'s <em><a href="Animal_Farm" title="wikilink">Animal Farm</a></em>, where the human race was reduced to dogs, pigs, and sheep.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> Brian Humphries was again called upon to engineer the album,<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> which was completed in December 1976.

For the subject of the cover image, he chose <a href="Battersea_Power_Station" title="wikilink">Battersea Power Station</a>, by then approaching the end of its useful life. The band commissioned a  pig-shaped balloon (known as <em>Algie</em>), and photography began on 2 December, with a trained marksman ready to fire if the balloon escaped. Inclement weather delayed filming, and O'Rourke had neglected to book the marksman for a second day. <em>Algie</em> broke free of its moorings and ascended into the sky, eventually landing in <a href="Kent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kent</a> where it was recovered by a local farmer, reportedly furious that it had &quot;apparently scared his cows.&quot;<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> Shooting continued for a third day, but the image of the pig was later superimposed onto the cover photograph as the early photographs of the power station were considered to be better.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a><a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a></p>

<p>The division of royalties became a sore topic during production of the album. Royalties were accorded on a per-song basis, and although Gilmour was largely responsible for &quot;Dogs&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;which took up almost the entire first side of the album&lt;U+2014&gt;he received less than Waters, who also contributed the two-part &quot;<a href="Pigs_on_the_Wing" title="wikilink">Pigs on the Wing</a>&quot;, which contains references to Waters' romantic involvement with Carolyne Anne Christie.{{#tag:ref|Carolyne Anne Christie was married to <a href="Rock_Scully" title="wikilink">Rock Scully</a>, manager of the Grateful Dead.

Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward <em>Animals</em> (the first Pink Floyd album not to contain a writing credit for Wright); Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering:<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a></p>

Waters began arriving at each venue alone, and departing immediately after the performance was complete, and Gilmour's wife Ginger did not get along with Waters' new girlfriend. On one occasion, Wright flew back to England threatening to leave the band. The size of the venues was also an issue,<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> and the end of the tour was a low point for Gilmour, who felt that the band had by then achieved the success they sought, and that there was nothing else to look forward to.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="the-wall"><em>The Wall</em></h4>

<p>The <em>In the Flesh</em> tour was Pink Floyd's first playing in large stadiums, and at one venue a small group of noisy and excited fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters so much that he spat at one of them. Waters was not the only person who felt depressed about playing in such large venues, as that same night Gilmour refused to perform the band's usual twelve-bar blues encore.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> About this time, Gilmour and Wright released their d&lt;U+00E9&gt;but solo albums, <em><a href="David_Gilmour_(album)" title="wikilink">David Gilmour</a></em>, and <em><a href="Wet_Dream_(album)" title="wikilink">Wet Dream</a></em>. Both albums sold poorly, a situation only exacerbated by the loss of much of the band's accumulated wealth. In 1976, the band had become involved with financial advisers Norton Warburg Group (NWG). NWG became the band's collecting agents and handled all financial planning, for an annual fee of about &lt;U+00A3&gt;300,000. Between &lt;U+00A3&gt;1.6 million and &lt;U+00A3&gt;3.3 million of the band's money was invested in high-risk venture capital schemes, primarily to reduce the band's exposure to high UK taxes. It soon became obvious that the band were still losing money. Not only did NWG invest in failing businesses, they also left the band liable for tax bills as high as 83% of their income. They eventually terminated their relationship with NWG, demanding the return of any cash not yet invested, which at that time amounted to &lt;U+00A3&gt;860,000 (they received &lt;U+00A3&gt;740,000).<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|Pink Floyd eventually sued NWG for &lt;U+00A3&gt;1M, accusing them of fraud and negligence. NWG collapsed in 1981. Andrew Warburg fled to Spain, Norton Warburg Investments (a part of NWG) was renamed to Waterbrook, and many of its holdings were sold at a huge loss. Andrew Warburg was jailed for three years upon his return to the UK in 1987.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}</p>
<p>In the midst of this, in July 1977, Waters presented the band with two new ideas. The first was a ninety-minute demo given the provisional title <em>Bricks in the Wall</em>, and the other what would later become his first solo album, <em><a href="The_Pros_and_Cons_of_Hitch_Hiking" title="wikilink">The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking</a></em>. Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, the former (inspired by the recent spitting incident) was chosen to be their next album.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> <a href="Bob_Ezrin" title="wikilink">Bob Ezrin</a> was brought in as co-producer, and he wrote a forty-page script for the new album.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> The story was based on the central character of Pink&lt;U+2014&gt;a character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences&lt;U+2014&gt;the most notable of which was the death of his father in World War II. This first 'brick in the wall' led to more problems, and Pink would become so drug-addled and worn down by the music industry that he would transform into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of <a href="Syd_Barrett" title="wikilink">Syd Barrett</a>. At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink 'tore down the wall', once again becoming a normal caring person.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a></p>

<p>To record <em>The Wall</em>, engineer Brian Humphries, emotionally drained by his five years with the band, was replaced by <a href="James_Guthrie_(record_producer)" title="wikilink">James Guthrie</a>.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> In March 1979, however, the band's critical financial situation demanded that they leave the UK for a year or more, and recording was moved to the <a href="Super_Bear_Studios" title="wikilink">Super Bear Studios</a> near <a href="Nice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nice</a>.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a><a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> The band were rarely in the studio together, but Waters' relationship with Wright broke down completely. Wright was given a trial period as a producer, but his working methods and lack of creative input caused considerable tension. Wright eventually stopped coming into the studio during the day, and worked only at nights.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a><a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> With a failing marriage and depression, he had his own problems, but matters came to a head when <a href="Columbia_Records" title="wikilink">Columbia</a> offered the band a better deal in exchange for a Christmas release of the album.

<p>What exactly happened next remains unclear. In <em>Inside Out</em> (2005), Mason says that Waters called O'Rourke, who was travelling to the US on the <em><a href="QE2" class="uri" title="wikilink">QE2</a></em>, and told him to have Wright out of the band by the time Waters arrived in LA to mix the album.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> In <em>Comfortably Numb</em> (2008), however, the author states that Waters called O'Rourke and asked him to tell Wright about the new recording arrangements and that Wright's response was apparently &quot;Tell Roger to fuck off &lt;U+2026&gt;&quot;.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> Wright disagreed with this recollection, stating that the band had agreed to record only through the spring and early summer and that he had no idea they were so far behind schedule. Waters was stunned and felt that Wright was not doing enough to help complete the album.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> Gilmour was on holiday in Dublin when he learned what was happening, and tried to calm the situation. He later spoke with Wright and gave him his support, but he reminded him about his lack of input on the album. Waters was insisting that Wright leave, or else he would refuse to release <em>The Wall</em>. Several days later, worried about their financial situation and the failing interpersonal relationships within the band, Wright quit.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a></p>
<p>Rumours persisted that Wright had a cocaine addiction (something he always disputed), and although his name did not appear anywhere on the finished album,<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a><a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> he was employed as a paid musician on the band's subsequent <em>The Wall</em> tour.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> Production of the album continued and by August 1979 the running order was largely complete.

Large inflatable puppets were also created for the live shows.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> On tour, relationships within the band were at an all-time low. Their four <a href="Winnebago_Industries" title="wikilink">Winnebagos</a> were parked in a circle, with the doors facing away from the centre. Waters used his own vehicle to arrive at the venue, and stayed in separate hotels from the rest of the band. Wright returned as a paid musician, and was the only 'member' of the band to profit from the venture, which lost about $600,000.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a></p>
<p>The album also spawned a film. The original plan was for the film to be a mixture of live concert footage and animated scenes. However, the concert footage proved impractical to film. <a href="Alan_Parker" title="wikilink">Alan Parker</a> agreed to direct, and took a different approach. The animated sequences would remain, but scenes would be acted by professional actors, with no dialogue. Waters was screen-tested but quickly discarded, and <a href="Bob_Geldof" title="wikilink">Bob Geldof</a> was asked to take the role of Pink. Geldof was initially disdainful, condemning <em>The Wall</em>'s storyline as &quot;bollocks&quot;.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> He was eventually won over by the prospect of being involved in a major film and receiving a large payment for his work. Waters took a six-week holiday during filming and returned to find that Parker had used his creative licence to change parts of the film to his liking. Waters was irate, the two fought, and Parker threatened to walk out. Gilmour pleaded with Waters to reconsider his stance, reminding the bassist that he and the other band members were shareholders and directors and could out-vote him on such decisions. A modified soundtrack was also created for some of the film's songs.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> <em>The Wall</em> was released in July 1982.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="the-final-cut"><em>The Final Cut</em></h4>

<p><em>Spare Bricks</em> was to have been the soundtrack album for <em>Pink Floyd The Wall</em>, but with the onset of the <a href="Falklands_War" title="wikilink">Falklands War</a>, Waters changed direction, and began writing new material. Waters saw <a href="Margaret_Thatcher" title="wikilink">Margaret Thatcher</a>'s response to the invasion of the islands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and he dedicated the new album&lt;U+2014&gt;provisionally titled <em>Requiem for a Post-War Dream</em>&lt;U+2014&gt;to his dead father. Immediately, there were arguments between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should contain all new material, rather than songs not considered good enough for <em>The Wall</em>. Waters felt that, lately, Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a></p>

<p>Michael Kamen (a contributor to the orchestral sections of <em>The Wall</em>) mediated between the two, and also performed the role traditionally occupied by the then absent Richard Wright. James Guthrie was the studio engineer, and Mason was aided by two session drummers. Recording took place in eight studios, including Gilmour's home studio at <a href="Outside_Studios" title="wikilink">Hookend Manor</a> and Waters' home studio at <a href="East_Sheen" title="wikilink">East Sheen</a>. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked separately (itself not unusual) but Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. Waters lost his temper, ranting at Kamen, who in boredom during one recording session, had started writing &quot;I Must Not Fuck Sheep&quot;<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a><a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> repeatedly on a notepad in the studio's control room. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name as producer was removed from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of song writing contributions.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> Mason's contributions were minimal, as he busied himself recording sound effects for an experimental new <a href="Holophonic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Holophonic</a> system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a></p>

<p>Hipgnosis had by this time disbanded, but again Thorgerson was passed over for the cover design, Waters choosing to design it himself. His brother-in-law, Willie Christie, was commissioned to take pictures for the album.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Final_Cut_(album)" title="wikilink">The Final Cut</a></em> was released in March 1983, going straight to #1 in the UK, and #6 in the US. &quot;<a href="Not_Now_John" title="wikilink">Not Now John</a>&quot; was released as a single, with its chorus of &quot;Fuck all that&quot; bowdlerised to &quot;Stuff all that&quot;. Despite its success, the album again received mixed reviews. <em>Melody Maker</em> declared it to be &quot;&lt;U+2026&gt; a milestone in the history of awfulness &lt;U+2026&gt;&quot;, but <em>Rolling Stone</em>'s <a href="Kurt_Loder" title="wikilink">Kurt Loder</a> viewed it as &quot;&lt;U+2026&gt; essentially a Roger Waters solo album &lt;U+2026&gt; a superlative achievement on several levels &lt;U+2026&gt;&quot;<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a><a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a></p>

He later stated that he also used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon after, Waters began touring his new solo album, <em><a href="The_Pros_and_Cons_of_Hitch_Hiking" title="wikilink">The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking</a></em>.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a> Richard Wright meanwhile formed Zee with Dave Harris, and recorded <em><a href="Identity_(Zee_album)" title="wikilink">Identity</a></em>, which went almost unnoticed upon its release.

<p>Waters believed that Pink Floyd was a spent force, and contacted O'Rourke with a view to settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, and as a result Waters tried to dismiss him. Waters then went to the <a href="High_Court_of_Justice" title="wikilink">High Court</a> to prevent the Pink Floyd name from ever being used again.<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a> His lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, and Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band's name.

However, Gilmour later told a <em><a href="Sunday_Times" title="wikilink">Sunday Times</a></em> reporter that &quot;Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him &lt;U+2026&gt;&quot;.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a></p>
<p>Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia and declared his intention to leave the group, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd, however, Waters later stated that by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract&lt;U+2014&gt;which would mean that royalty payments would be suspended&lt;U+2014&gt;and that he was effectively forced from the band as the other members threatened to sue him.

Artists such as <a href="Jon_Carin" title="wikilink">Jon Carin</a> and <a href="Phil_Manzanera" title="wikilink">Phil Manzanera</a> worked on the album, and they were also joined by Bob Ezrin.<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a> Gilmour was also contacted by Wright's new wife. She had heard that he was working on new material and asked if Wright could contribute. Gilmour considered the request; there were several legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead he was brought back in.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> Gilmour later admitted in an interview with author Karl Dallas that Wright's presence &quot;would make us stronger legally and musically&quot;.

<p>The album was recorded along the <a href="River_Thames" title="wikilink">River Thames</a>, on Gilmour's houseboat <em><a href="Astoria_(recording_studio)" title="wikilink">Astoria</a></em>. <a href="Andrew_Jackson_(recording_engineer)" title="wikilink">Andy Jackson</a> (a colleague of Guthrie) was brought in as engineer.

He instead busied himself with the album's sound effects. In a change from previous Floyd albums, <em>A Momentary Lapse</em> was recorded onto a 32-channel Mitsubishi digital recorder, and used <a href="MIDI" class="uri" title="wikilink">MIDI</a> synchronisation with the aid of an <a href="Apple_Macintosh" title="wikilink">Apple Macintosh</a> computer.<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a><a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a></p>

<p>Waters on one occasion visited <em>Astoria</em> to see Ezrin, along with Christie, by then his wife. As he was still a shareholder and director of Pink Floyd music, he was able to block any decisions made by his former bandmates. Recording moved to <a href="Mayfair_Studios" title="wikilink">Mayfair and Audio International Studios</a>, and then to Los Angeles&lt;U+2014&gt;&quot;It was fantastic because &lt;U+2026&gt; the lawyers couldn't call in the middle of recording unless they were calling in the middle of the night.&quot;<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a> Waters tried to block a proposed Pink Floyd tour, by contacting every promoter in the US, threatening to sue if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the startup costs (Mason, separated from his wife, used his <a href="Ferrari_250_GTO" title="wikilink">Ferrari 250 GTO</a> as collateral). Some promoters were offended by Waters' threat, and several months later, tickets went on sale in <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a> (and were sold out within hours).<a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a></p>

Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's best form, Wright would later disagree, stating &quot;Roger's criticisms are fair. It's not a band album at all.&quot;<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a> <em>Q Magazine</em>'s view was that the album was primarily a Gilmour solo effort.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a></p>

<p>Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright completely out of practice, and realising he'd taken on too much work Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to take charge. As the new band toured throughout North America, Waters' <em>Radio K.A.O.S.</em> tour was, on occasion, close by. The bassist had forbidden any members of Pink Floyd from attending his concerts,{{#tag:ref|Mason (2005) goes some way toward backing this statement up, by stating that &quot;rumour had it we would not be allowed in&quot;<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} which were generally in smaller venues than those housing his former band's performances. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the <a href="Pink_Floyd_pigs" title="wikilink">flying pig</a>, and Pink Floyd responded by attaching a huge set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from his design. However, by November 1987 Waters appeared to admit defeat, and on 23 December a legal settlement was finally reached. Mason and Gilmour were allowed use of the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity, and Waters would be granted, amongst other things, <em>The Wall</em>. The bickering continued, however, with Waters issuing the occasional slight against his former friends, and Gilmour and Mason responding by making light of Waters claims that they would fail without him.<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Sun_(newspaper)" title="wikilink">The Sun</a></em> printed a story about Waters, who it claimed had paid an artist to create 150 toilet rolls with Gilmour's face on every sheet. Waters later denied this story.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="the-division-bell"><em>The Division Bell</em></h4>

<p>For several years thereafter the three members of Pink Floyd busied themselves with personal pursuits, such as filming and competing in the <a href="Carrera_Panamericana" title="wikilink">Carrera Panamericana</a> (where Gilmour and O'Rourke crashed), and later recording a soundtrack for the film.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a> Gilmour divorced Ginger, and Mason married actress Annette Lynton.<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a> In January 1993 the band began working on a new album. They returned to a then remodelled Britannia Row Studios, where for several days Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively, ad-libbing new material. After about two weeks the band had enough ideas to start creating new songs.{{#tag:ref|Mason (2005) also writes that they had enough left-over material to create a separate release.<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Bob Ezrin returned to work on the album, and production moved to <em>Astoria</em> where from February to May 1993 the band worked on about twenty-five ideas.<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a> Contractually, Wright was still not a full member of the band: &quot;It came very close to a point where I wasn't going to do the album&quot;,<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a> a situation which clearly upset the keyboardist. However, he was given his first songwriting credit on a Pink Floyd album since 1975's <em>Wish You Were Here</em>. Another songwriter credited on the album was Gilmour's new girlfriend, <a href="Polly_Samson" title="wikilink">Polly Samson</a>. She helped write &quot;<a href="High_Hopes_(Pink_Floyd_song)" title="wikilink">High Hopes</a>&quot; with Gilmour&lt;U+2014&gt;along with several other tracks&lt;U+2014&gt;a situation which, though initially tense, according to Ezrin &quot;pulled the whole album together&quot;.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a> She also helped Gilmour, who, following his divorce, had developed a cocaine habit.<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a> Michael Kamen was brought in to work on the album's various string arrangements,<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a> and <a href="Dick_Parry" title="wikilink">Dick Parry</a> and <a href="Chris_Thomas_(record_producer)" title="wikilink">Chris Thomas</a> also returned.<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a></p>

<p>Keen to avoid competing against other album releases (as had happened with <em>A Momentary Lapse</em>) the band set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would begin touring again. The album title was chosen by writer <a href="Douglas_Adams" title="wikilink">Douglas Adams</a>, and Storm Thorgerson once again provided the cover artwork.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a> Thorgerson also provided six new pieces of film for the upcoming tour.<a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260"><sup>260</sup></a> The band spent three weeks rehearsing in a hangar at <a href="Norton_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Norton Air Force Base</a> in <a href="San_Bernardino,_California" title="wikilink">San Bernardino, California</a><a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a> before opening on 29 March 1994 in <a href="Miami" class="uri" title="wikilink">Miami</a> with an almost identical crew to that used for their <em>Momentary Lapse of Reason</em> tour.

<p>Waters declined the band's invitation to join them as the tour reached Europe, later expressing his annoyance that some Floyd songs were again being performed in large venues.

<p>On Saturday 2 July 2005 at the <a href="Live_8" title="wikilink">Live 8</a> concert, the classic lineup of Pink Floyd performed together on stage&lt;U+2014&gt;for the first time in over 24 years.<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267"><sup>267</sup></a><a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268"><sup>268</sup></a> The reunion had been arranged by Live 8 organiser <a href="Bob_Geldof" title="wikilink">Bob Geldof</a>, who had called Mason earlier in the year to discuss the band reuniting for Live 8. Geldof had already asked Gilmour, who had turned down the offer, and asked Mason to intercede on his behalf. Mason declined, but contacted Waters, who was immediately enthusiastic. Waters then called Geldof to discuss the event, which was at that time only a month away. About two weeks later, Waters called Gilmour&lt;U+2014&gt;their first conversation for about two years&lt;U+2014&gt;and the next day the latter agreed. Wright was contacted, and immediately agreed. Statements were issued to the press which stressed the unimportance of the band's problems, compared to the context of the Live 8 event. The setlist was planned at the <a href="Connaught_Hotel" title="wikilink">Connaught Hotel</a> in London, followed by three days of rehearsals at <a href="Black_Island_Studios" title="wikilink">Black Island Studios</a>. The sessions were troublesome, with minor disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising. Waters wanted to use the occasion to expand the concepts he had designed, whereas Gilmour wanted to perform the songs in exactly the way the audience would expect. The final setlist and running order was decided on the eve of the concert.<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269"><sup>269</sup></a><a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a> Gilmour and Waters shared lead vocals. On stage, at the start of &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; Waters told the audience: &quot;It's actually quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys after all these years, standing to be counted with the rest of you. Anyway, we're doing this for everyone who's not here, and particularly of course for Syd.&quot; At the end of their performance Gilmour thanked the audience, and started to walk off the stage, but Waters called him back and the band shared a group hug that became one of the more notable images from Live 8.<a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271"><sup>271</sup></a><a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272"><sup>272</sup></a></p>

<p>In the week following their performance there was a revival of interest in Pink Floyd. According to <a href="HMV" class="uri" title="wikilink">HMV</a>, in the week following sales of <em>Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd</em> rose by 1343%, while <a href="Amazon.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amazon.com</a> reported a significant increase in sales of <em>The Wall</em>. Gilmour subsequently declared that he would donate his share of profits from this sales boom to charity, and urged other artists and <a href="Record_industry" title="wikilink">record companies</a> profiting from Live 8 to do the same.<a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273"><sup>273</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="live-performances">Live performances</h2>

<p>Pink Floyd are regarded as pioneers in the <a href="Concert" title="wikilink">live music</a> experience, and were renowned for their lavish stage shows, in which the performers themselves were almost secondary. Pink Floyd also set high standards in sound quality, and made use of innovative sound effects and <a href="quadraphonic" class="uri" title="wikilink">quadraphonic</a> speaker systems.<a href="#fn352" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref352"><sup>352</sup></a> From their earliest days they were well known for their use of visual effects, which accompanied the <a href="psychedelic_rock" title="wikilink">psychedelic rock</a> pieces performed at venues such as the <a href="UFO_Club" title="wikilink">UFO Club</a> in London.<a href="#fn353" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref353"><sup>353</sup></a></p>
<p>The quality of their live performances, even when pre-recorded, was considered by the band to be extremely important; they boycotted the press release of <em>The Dark Side of the Moon</em> as they felt presenting the album through a poor-quality <a href="PA_system" title="wikilink">PA system</a> was not good enough.<a href="#fn354" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref354"><sup>354</sup></a><a href="#fn355" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref355"><sup>355</sup></a> The album had been composed and refined mostly while the band toured the UK, Japan, North America, and Europe.<a href="#fn356" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref356"><sup>356</sup></a> <em>Animals</em> was the centrepiece for their <em><a href="In_the_Flesh_Tour" title="wikilink">In the Flesh</a></em> tour, which began in <a href="Dortmund" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dortmund</a>, and continued through Europe to the UK, and then the US. A inflatable floating pig named <em>Algie</em> became the inspiration for a number of pig themes used throughout the tour.<a href="#fn357" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref357"><sup>357</sup></a></p>
<p>Although Pink Floyd were experienced live performers, the behaviour of the audience on their <em>In the Flesh</em> tour, and the sizes of the venues they played, were a powerful influence on their concept album, <em><a href="The_Wall" title="wikilink">The Wall</a></em>. The subsequent <em><a href="The_Wall_Tour" title="wikilink">The Wall Tour</a></em> featured a  high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience. Animations were projected onto the wall, and gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes in the story. Several characters from the story were realised as giant inflatables.<a href="#fn358" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref358"><sup>358</sup></a> One of the more notable elements of the tour was the performance of &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;. While Waters sang his opening verse, Gilmour waited in darkness, for his cue, on top of the wall. When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly illuminate him. Gilmour stood on a <a href="flight_case" title="wikilink">flight case</a> on castors, a dangerous set-up supported from behind by a technician, both supported by a tall hydraulic platform.<a href="#fn359" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref359"><sup>359</sup></a></p>
<p>Two years after the departure of Waters the band embarked on their <a href="A_Momentary_Lapse_of_Reason_Tour" title="wikilink">A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour</a>. Starting in <a href="Ottawa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ottawa</a> on 9 September they spent about two years touring the US, Japan, Europe, and Central Asia. In <a href="Venice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venice</a>, the band played to an audience of 200,000 fans at the <a href="Piazza_San_Marco" title="wikilink">Piazza San Marco</a>. The resulting storm of protest over the city's lack of toilet provision, first aid, and accommodation, resulted in the resignation of Mayor Antonio Casellati and his government. At the end of the tour Pink Floyd released <em><a href="Delicate_Sound_of_Thunder" title="wikilink">Delicate Sound of Thunder</a></em>,<a href="#fn360" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref360"><sup>360</sup></a> and in 1989 a concert video&lt;U+2014&gt;<em><a href="Delicate_Sound_of_Thunder_(film)" title="wikilink">Delicate Sound of Thunder</a></em>.<a href="#fn361" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref361"><sup>361</sup></a></p>
<p>During the band's <em>Division Bell</em> tour, an unidentified person using the name <a href="Publius_Enigma" title="wikilink">Publius</a> posted a message on an internet newsgroup, inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. The veracity of the user was demonstrated when white lights in front of the stage at the Pink Floyd concert in <a href="East_Rutherford" title="wikilink">East Rutherford</a> spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court in October 1994, the word enigma was projected in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that the <a href="Publius_Enigma" title="wikilink">Publius Enigma</a> did exist, and that it had been instigated by the record company rather than the band. As of  the puzzle remains unsolved.<a href="#fn362" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref362"><sup>362</sup></a></p>
