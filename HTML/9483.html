<p><strong>Disco</strong> is a <a href="genre" class="uri" title="wikilink">genre</a> of <a href="dance_music" title="wikilink">dance music</a>. Disco acts charted high during the mid-1970s, and the genre's popularity peaked during the late 1970s. Its initial audiences were club-goers from the <a href="African-American_culture" title="wikilink">African American</a>, <a href="Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans#Culture" title="wikilink">Latino</a>, <a href="gay" class="uri" title="wikilink">gay</a>, and <a href="Psychedelia" title="wikilink">psychedelic</a> communities in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> and <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a> during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco also was a reaction against both the domination of <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock music</a> and the stigmatization of dance music by the <a href="counterculture" class="uri" title="wikilink">counterculture</a> during this period. Women embraced disco as well, and the music eventually expanded to several other popular groups of the time.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In what is considered a forerunner to disco style clubs, New York City DJ <a href="David_Mancuso" title="wikilink">David Mancuso</a> opened <a href="The_Loft" title="wikilink">The Loft</a>, a members-only private dance club set in his own home, in February 1970.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> <a href="Allmusic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Allmusic</a> claims some have argued that <a href="Isaac_Hayes" title="wikilink">Isaac Hayes</a> and <a href="Barry_White" title="wikilink">Barry White</a> were playing what would be called disco music as early as 1971. According to the music guide, there is disagreement as to what the first disco song was.

<p>Musical influences include <a href="funk" class="uri" title="wikilink">funk</a>, <a href="Latin_music" title="wikilink">Latin</a> and <a href="soul_music" title="wikilink">soul music</a>. The disco sound has soaring, often reverberated vocals over a steady <a href="four-on-the-floor_(music)" title="wikilink">&quot;four-on-the-floor&quot;</a> beat, an <a href="eighth_note" title="wikilink">eighth note</a> (quaver) or 16th note (semi-quaver) <a href="hi-hat" class="uri" title="wikilink">hi-hat</a> pattern with an open hi-hat on the off-beat, and a prominent, <a href="syncopated" class="uri" title="wikilink">syncopated</a> <a href="bass_guitar" title="wikilink">electric bass</a> line sometimes consisting of octaves. The <a href="Fender_Jazz_Bass" title="wikilink">Fender Jazz Bass</a> is often associated with disco bass lines, because the instrument itself has a very prominent &quot;voice&quot; in the musical mix. In most disco tracks, strings, horns, electric pianos, and electric guitars create a lush background sound. Orchestral instruments such as the flute are often used for solo melodies, and <a href="lead_guitar" title="wikilink">lead guitar</a> is less frequently in disco than in rock. Many disco songs employ the use of electronic instruments such as <a href="synthesizer" title="wikilink">synthesizers</a>.</p>
<p>Well-known late 1970s disco performers included <a href="Donna_Summer" title="wikilink">Donna Summer</a>, The <a href="Bee_Gees" title="wikilink">Bee Gees</a>, <a href="KC_and_the_Sunshine_Band" title="wikilink">KC and the Sunshine Band</a>, <a href="The_Trammps" title="wikilink">The Trammps</a>, <a href="Van_McCoy" title="wikilink">Van McCoy</a>, <a href="Gloria_Gaynor" title="wikilink">Gloria Gaynor</a>, <a href="The_Village_People" title="wikilink">The Village People</a>, <a href="Chic_(band)" title="wikilink">Chic</a>, and <a href="The_Jackson_5" title="wikilink">The Jacksons</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;the latter which first dipped its toes into disco as The Jackson 5. Summer would become the first well-known and most popular disco artist&lt;U+2014&gt;eventually having the title &quot;The Queen of Disco&quot; bestowed upon her by various critics&lt;U+2014&gt;and would also play a part in pioneering the <a href="Electronic_music" title="wikilink">electronic sound</a> that later became a prominent element of disco. While performers and singers garnered the lion's share of public attention, producers working behind the scenes played an equal, if not more important role in disco, since they often wrote the songs and created the innovative sounds and production techniques that were part of the &quot;disco sound.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Many non-disco artists recorded disco songs at the height of disco's popularity, and films such as <em><a href="Saturday_Night_Fever" title="wikilink">Saturday Night Fever</a></em> and <em><a href="Thank_God_It&#39;s_Friday" title="wikilink">Thank God It's Friday</a></em> contributed to disco's rise in mainstream popularity. According to music writer <a href="Piero_Scaruffi" title="wikilink">Piero Scaruffi</a> the disco phenomenon spread quickly because the &quot;collective ecstasy&quot; of disco was cathartic and regenerative and led to freedom of expression.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Disco was the last mass popular music movement that was driven by the <a href="baby_boom_generation" title="wikilink">baby boom generation</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Disco music was a worldwide phenomenon, but its popularity declined in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> in the late 1970s. On July 12, 1979, an anti-disco protest in <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a> called &quot;<a href="Disco_Demolition_Night" title="wikilink">Disco Demolition Night</a>&quot; had shown that an angry <a href="backlash_(sociology)" title="wikilink">backlash</a> against disco and its culture had emerged in the United States. In the subsequent months and years, many musical acts associated with disco struggled to get airplay on the radio. A few artists still managed to score disco-style hits in the early 1980s, but the term &quot;disco&quot; became unfashionable in the new decade and was eventually replaced by &quot;dance music&quot;, &quot;dance pop&quot;, and other identifiers. Although the production techniques have changed, many successful acts since the 1970s have retained the basic disco beat and mentality, and dance clubs have remained popular.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>The term &quot;<a href="night_club" title="wikilink">discoth&lt;U+00E8&gt;que</a>&quot; was coined in Europe to describe clubs where there was no live music played (a.k.a. disk-only events). In Occupied France, jazz and bebop music plus the jitterbug were banned by the Nazis as decadent American influences, so members of the <a href="French_Resistance" title="wikilink">Resistance</a> met at hidden underground dance clubs called discotheques (fr. record collection) where they danced to American swing music, which a DJ played on a single turntable when a jukebox was not available. These &quot;discotheques&quot; were also patronized by anti-Vichy youth called <a href="zazous" class="uri" title="wikilink">zazous</a> who much like the kids in the USA during the 1940s were wearing zoot suits.

<p>Philly and New York soul were evolutions of the <a href="Motown_sound" title="wikilink">Motown sound</a>.

<p>The early disco sound was largely an urban American phenomenon with producers and labels such as SalSoul Records (Ken, Joe and Stanley Cayre), West End Records (Mel Cheren), Casablanca (Neil Bogart), and Prelude (Marvin Schlachter) to name a few.</p>
<p>The disco sound was also shaped by <a href="Tom_Moulton" title="wikilink">Tom Moulton</a> who wanted to extend the enjoyment of the music&lt;U+2014&gt;thus creating the extended mix or &quot;<a href="remix" class="uri" title="wikilink">remix</a>&quot;. This has influenced many other latter genres such as <a href="techno" class="uri" title="wikilink">techno</a>, and <a href="pop_music" title="wikilink">pop</a>. DJs and remixers would often remix (that is, re-edit) existing songs using reel-to-reel tape machines. Their remixed versions would add in percussion breaks, new sections, and new sounds. Other influential DJs and remixers who helped to establish what became known as the &quot;disco sound&quot; included <a href="David_Mancuso" title="wikilink">David Mancuso</a>, <a href="Nicky_Siano" title="wikilink">Nicky Siano</a>, <a href="Shep_Pettibone" title="wikilink">Shep Pettibone</a>, <a href="Larry_Levan" title="wikilink">Larry Levan</a>, <a href="Walter_Gibbons" title="wikilink">Walter Gibbons</a>, and Chicago-based &quot;Godfather of House&quot; <a href="Frankie_Knuckles" title="wikilink">Frankie Knuckles</a>.</p>

<p>In December 1977, the film <em><a href="Saturday_Night_Fever" title="wikilink">Saturday Night Fever</a></em> was released.

<p>Disco's popularity led many non-disco artists to record disco songs at the height of its popularity. Many of their songs were not &quot;pure&quot; disco, but were instead rock or pop songs with (sometimes inescapable) disco influence or overtones. Notable examples include <a href="Blondie_(band)" title="wikilink">Blondie</a>'s &quot;<a href="Heart_of_Glass_(song)" title="wikilink">Heart of Glass</a>&quot; (1978), <a href="Cher" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cher</a>'s &quot;<a href="Hell_on_Wheels" title="wikilink">Hell on Wheels</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Take_Me_Home_(Cher_song)" title="wikilink">Take Me Home</a>&quot; (both 1979), <a href="Barry_Manilow" title="wikilink">Barry Manilow</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s &quot;<a href="Copacabana_(song)" title="wikilink">Copacabana</a>&quot; (1978), <a href="David_Bowie" title="wikilink">David Bowie</a>'s &quot;John I'm Only Dancing (Again)&quot; (1975), <a href="Rod_Stewart" title="wikilink">Rod Stewart</a>'s &quot;<a href="Da_Ya_Think_I&#39;m_Sexy?" title="wikilink">Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?</a>&quot; (1979), <a href="Electric_Light_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Electric Light Orchestra</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s &quot;<a href="Shine_a_Little_Love" title="wikilink">Shine a Little Love</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Don&#39;t_Bring_Me_Down" title="wikilink">Don't Bring Me Down</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="Last_Train_to_London" title="wikilink">Last Train to London</a>&quot; (all 1979), <a href="George_Benson" title="wikilink">George Benson</a>'s &quot;<a href="Give_Me_the_Night_(George_Benson_song)" title="wikilink">Give Me the Night</a>&quot; (1980), <a href="Elton_John" title="wikilink">Elton John</a> and <a href="Kiki_Dee" title="wikilink">Kiki Dee</a>'s &quot;<a href="Don&#39;t_Go_Breaking_My_Heart" title="wikilink">Don't Go Breaking My Heart</a>&quot; (1976), and <a href="Diana_Ross" title="wikilink">Diana Ross</a>' &quot;<a href="Upside_Down_(Diana_Ross_song)" title="wikilink">Upside Down</a>&quot; (1980).</p>

<p>Pre-existing non-disco songs and standards would frequently be &quot;disco-ized&quot; in the 1970s. The rich orchestral accompaniment that became identified with the disco era conjured up the memories of the <a href="big_band" title="wikilink">big band</a> era&lt;U+2014&gt;which brought out several artists that recorded and disco-ized some big band arrangements including <a href="Perry_Como" title="wikilink">Perry Como</a>, who re-recorded his 1929 and 1939 hit, &quot;Temptation&quot;, in 1975, as well as <a href="Ethel_Merman" title="wikilink">Ethel Merman</a>, who released an album of disco songs entitled <em><a href="The_Ethel_Merman_Disco_Album" title="wikilink">The Ethel Merman Disco Album</a></em> in 1979. <a href="Myron_Floren" title="wikilink">Myron Floren</a>, second-in-command on <em><a href="The_Lawrence_Welk_Show" title="wikilink">The Lawrence Welk Show</a></em>, released a recording of the <a href="Clarinet_Polka" title="wikilink">Clarinet Polka</a> entitled &quot;Disco Accordion&quot;.

Anti-disco sentiment was expressed in some television shows and films. A recurring theme on the show <em><a href="WKRP_in_Cincinnati" title="wikilink">WKRP in Cincinnati</a></em> was a hateful attitude towards disco music. In one scene of the comedy film <em><a href="Airplane!" class="uri" title="wikilink">Airplane!</a></em>, a city skyline features a radio tower with a <a href="neon" class="uri" title="wikilink">neon</a>-lighted station callsign.

<p>July 12, 1979 became known as &quot;the day disco died&quot; because of <em><a href="Disco_Demolition_Night" title="wikilink">Disco Demolition Night</a></em>, an anti-disco demonstration at <a href="Comiskey_Park" title="wikilink">Comiskey Park</a> in Chicago.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Rock station DJs Steve Dahl and <a href="Garry_Meier" title="wikilink">Garry Meier</a>, along with Michael Veeck, son of <a href="Chicago_White_Sox" title="wikilink">Chicago White Sox</a> owner <a href="Bill_Veeck" title="wikilink">Bill Veeck</a>, staged the promotional event for disgruntled rock fans between the games of a White Sox doubleheader.

<h4 id="impact-on-music-industry">Impact on music industry</h4>
<p>The anti-disco backlash, combined with other societal and radio industry factors, changed the face of pop radio in the years following Disco Demolition Night. <a href="Top_40" title="wikilink">Top 40</a> radio stations did a turn-around and avoided playing music by black and Latin artists in general to avoid being labeled with the dreaded &quot;disco&quot; tag, regardless of what music style those artists performed. Starting in the 1980s, <a href="country_music" title="wikilink">country music</a> began a slow rise in the main pop charts. Emblematic of country music's rise to mainstream popularity was the commercially successful 1980 movie <em><a href="Urban_Cowboy" title="wikilink">Urban Cowboy</a></em>. Somewhat ironically, the star of the film was <a href="John_Travolta" title="wikilink">John Travolta</a>, who only three years before had starred in <em><a href="Saturday_Night_Fever" title="wikilink">Saturday Night Fever</a></em>, a film that celebrated disco culture.</p>
<p>During this period of decline in disco's popularity, several record companies folded, were reorganized, or were sold. In 1979, <a href="MCA_Records" title="wikilink">MCA Records</a> purchased <a href="ABC_Records" title="wikilink">ABC Records</a>, absorbed some of its artists, and then shut the label down. <a href="RSO_Records" title="wikilink">RSO Records</a> founder <a href="Robert_Stigwood" title="wikilink">Robert Stigwood</a> left the label in 1981 and <a href="TK_Records" title="wikilink">TK Records</a> closed in the same year. <a href="Salsoul_Records" title="wikilink">Salsoul Records</a> folded in 1984.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> <a href="Casablanca_Records" title="wikilink">Casablanca Records</a> had been releasing fewer records in the 1980s, and was shut down in 1986 by parent company <a href="PolyGram" class="uri" title="wikilink">PolyGram</a>.</p>
<p>Many groups that were popular during the disco period subsequently struggled to maintain their success&lt;U+2014&gt;even those that tried to adapt to evolving musical tastes. The <a href="Bee_Gees" title="wikilink">Bee Gees</a>, for instance, never had a major hit in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> after the 1970s&lt;U+2014&gt;even though later songs they wrote and had <em>others</em> perform were successful.

<p><a href="Steve_Dahl" title="wikilink">Steve Dahl</a>, who had spearheaded Disco Demolition Night, denied any racist or homophobic undertones to the promotion, saying, &quot;It's really easy to look at it historically, from this perspective, and attach all those things to it.

<h3 id="revivals">Revivals</h3>
<p>In the late 1980s and increasingly through the 1990s, a revival of the original disco style began to emerge.</p>
<p>By the mid to late 2000s, many disco-influenced songs were hits. Disco tributes continue to be popular draws. The <a href="World&#39;s_Largest_Disco" title="wikilink">World's Largest Disco</a>, an annual celebration held over <a href="Thanksgiving_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Thanksgiving</a> weekend in <a href="Buffalo,_New_York" title="wikilink">Buffalo, New York</a>, draws thousands of disco fans in 1970s-era attire. In addition to playing disco hits of the era, artists from the 1970s perform live.</p>
<h2 id="euro-disco">Euro disco</h2>

<p>Euro disco was not as funky, more pop oriented, and less <a href="soul_music" title="wikilink">soul</a> influenced than American styled disco. European acts <a href="Silver_Convention" title="wikilink">Silver Convention</a>, <a href="Love_and_Kisses" title="wikilink">Love and Kisses</a>, <a href="Munich_Machine" title="wikilink">Munich Machine</a>, and American acts <a href="Donna_Summer" title="wikilink">Donna Summer</a>, and the <a href="Village_People" title="wikilink">Village People</a> were acts that defined the late 1970s Eurodisco sound. Producers <a href="Giorgio_Moroder" title="wikilink">Giorgio Moroder</a> whom <a href="Allmusic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Allmusic</a> described as &quot;one of the principal architects of the disco sound&quot; and <a href="Jean-Marc_Cerrone" title="wikilink">Jean-Marc Cerrone</a> were involved with Eurodisco.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> The highly influential German group <a href="Kraftwerk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kraftwerk</a> is regarded by some as the first Euro disco act.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>By far the most successful Euro disco act was <a href="ABBA" class="uri" title="wikilink">ABBA</a>. This Swedish quartet&lt;U+2014&gt;with such hits as &quot;<a href="Waterloo_(ABBA_song)" title="wikilink">Waterloo</a>&quot; (1974), &quot;<a href="Fernando_(song)" title="wikilink">Fernando</a>&quot; (1976), &quot;<a href="Take_a_Chance_on_Me" title="wikilink">Take a Chance on Me</a>&quot; (1978), and their signature smash &quot;<a href="Dancing_Queen" title="wikilink">Dancing Queen</a>&quot; (1976)&lt;U+2014&gt;ranks as the <a href="List_of_best-selling_music_artists" title="wikilink">eighth best-selling act of all time</a>.

<h2 id="role-of-motown">Role of Motown</h2>
<p><a href="Diana_Ross" title="wikilink">Diana Ross</a> was one of the first <a href="Motown" class="uri" title="wikilink">Motown</a> artists to embrace the disco sound with her hugely successful 1976 outing &quot;<a href="Love_Hangover" title="wikilink">Love Hangover</a>&quot; from her self-entitled album. Ross would continue to score disco hits for the rest of the disco era, including the 1980 dance classics &quot;<a href="Upside_Down" title="wikilink">Upside Down</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="I&#39;m_Coming_Out" title="wikilink">I'm Coming Out</a>&quot; (the latter immediately becoming a favorite in the gay community). Ironically enough, the group Ross led to superstardom during the 1960s, <a href="The_Supremes" title="wikilink">The Supremes</a>, scored a handful of hits in the disco clubs without Ross, most notably 1976's &quot;<a href="I&#39;m_Gonna_Let_My_Heart_Do_the_Walking" title="wikilink">I'm Gonna Let My Heart Do the Walking</a>&quot; and, their last charted single before disbanding, 1977's &quot;You're My Driving Wheel&quot;.</p>
<p>Also noteworthy are <a href="Cheryl_Lynn" title="wikilink">Cheryl Lynn</a>'s &quot;<a href="Got_to_Be_Real" title="wikilink">Got to Be Real</a>&quot; (1978), <a href="Evelyn_King_(singer)" title="wikilink">Evelyn &quot;Champagne&quot; King</a>'s &quot;<a href="Shame_(Evelyn_King_song)" title="wikilink">Shame</a>&quot; (1978), <a href="Cher" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cher</a>'s &quot;<a href="Take_Me_Home_(Cher_song)" title="wikilink">Take Me Home</a>&quot; (1979), <a href="Sister_Sledge" title="wikilink">Sister Sledge</a>'s &quot;<a href="We_Are_Family_(song)" title="wikilink">We Are Family</a>&quot; (1979), <a href="Geraldine_Hunt" title="wikilink">Geraldine Hunt</a>'s &quot;<a href="Can&#39;t_Fake_the_Feeling" title="wikilink">Can't Fake the Feeling</a>&quot; (1980), and <a href="Walter_Murphy" title="wikilink">Walter Murphy</a>'s various attempts to bring <a href="classical_music" title="wikilink">classical music</a> to the mainstream, most notably his hit &quot;<a href="A_Fifth_of_Beethoven" title="wikilink">A Fifth of Beethoven</a>&quot; (1976).</p>
<h2 id="musical-characteristics">Musical characteristics</h2>
<p><img src="Characteristic_disco_bass_rhythm.PNG" title="fig:Disco bass pattern. |thumb|250px" alt="Disco bass pattern. |thumb|250px" /> <img src="Characteristic_rock_and_disco_drum_patterns.png" title="fig:Rock &amp; disco drum patterns: disco features greater subdivision of the beat, which is four-to-the-floor|thumb|250px" alt="Rock &amp; disco drum patterns: disco features greater subdivision of the beat, which is four-to-the-floor|thumb|250px" />  The music tended to layer soaring, often-reverberated vocals, which are often doubled by horns, over a background &quot;pad&quot; of electric pianos and wah-pedaled &quot;chicken-scratch&quot; guitars. Other backing keyboard instruments include the <a href="piano" class="uri" title="wikilink">piano</a>, organ (during early years), string synth, and electroacoustic keyboards such as the Fender Rhodes piano, Wurlitzer electric piano, and Hohner Clavinet. Synthesizers are also fairly common in disco, especially in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>The rhythm is laid down by prominent, syncopated basslines (with heavy use of octaves) played on the <a href="bass_guitar" title="wikilink">bass guitar</a> and by drummers using a <a href="drum_kit" title="wikilink">drum kit</a>, African/<a href="Latin_percussion" title="wikilink">Latin percussion</a>, and <a href="electronic_drum" title="wikilink">electronic drums</a> such as Simmons and <a href="Roland_Corporation" title="wikilink">Roland</a> <a href="sound_module" title="wikilink">drum modules</a>). The sound is enriched with solo lines and harmony parts played by a variety of orchestral instruments, such as <a href="harp" class="uri" title="wikilink">harp</a>, <a href="violin" class="uri" title="wikilink">violin</a>, <a href="viola" class="uri" title="wikilink">viola</a>, <a href="cello" class="uri" title="wikilink">cello</a>, <a href="trumpet" class="uri" title="wikilink">trumpet</a>, <a href="saxophone" class="uri" title="wikilink">saxophone</a>, <a href="trombone" class="uri" title="wikilink">trombone</a>, <a href="clarinet" class="uri" title="wikilink">clarinet</a>, <a href="flugelhorn" class="uri" title="wikilink">flugelhorn</a>, <a href="French_horn" title="wikilink">French horn</a>, <a href="tuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuba</a>, <a href="English_horn" title="wikilink">English horn</a>, <a href="oboe" class="uri" title="wikilink">oboe</a>, <a href="flute" class="uri" title="wikilink">flute</a> (sometimes especially the <a href="alto_flute" title="wikilink">alto flute</a> and occasionally <a href="bass_flute" title="wikilink">bass flute</a>), <a href="piccolo" class="uri" title="wikilink">piccolo</a>, <a href="timpani" class="uri" title="wikilink">timpani</a> and <a href="synthesizer" title="wikilink">synth strings</a> or a full-blown <a href="string_orchestra" title="wikilink">string orchestra</a>.</p>
<p>Most disco songs have a steady <a href="four-on-the-floor_(music)" title="wikilink">four-on-the-floor</a> beat, a <a href="quaver" class="uri" title="wikilink">quaver</a> or semi-quaver <a href="hi-hat" class="uri" title="wikilink">hi-hat</a> pattern with an open hi-hat on the off-beat, and a heavy, syncopated bass line. This basic beat would appear to be related to the Dominican <a href="Merengue_music" title="wikilink">merengue</a> rhythm. Other Latin rhythms such as the rhumba, the samba and the cha-cha-cha are also found in disco recordings, and Latin <a href="polyrhythm" title="wikilink">polyrhythms</a>, such as a rhumba beat layered over a merengue, are commonplace. The quaver pattern is often supported by other instruments such as the rhythm guitar and may be implied rather than explicitly present.</p>
<p>It often involves <a href="syncopation" class="uri" title="wikilink">syncopation</a>, rarely occurring on the beat unless a <a href="synthesizer" class="uri" title="wikilink">synthesizer</a> is used to replace the bass guitar. In general, the difference between a disco, or any dance song, and a rock or popular song is that in dance music the bass hits <em>four to the floor</em>, at least once a beat (which in 4/4 time is 4 beats per measure), whereas in rock the bass hits on one and three and lets the snare take the lead on two and four. Disco is further characterized by a 16th note division of the quarter notes established by the bass as shown in the second drum pattern below, after a typical rock drum pattern.</p>
<p>The orchestral sound usually known as &quot;disco sound&quot; relies heavily on strings and horns playing linear phrases, in unison with the soaring, often reverberated vocals or playing instrumental fills, while electric pianos and chicken-scratch guitars create the background &quot;pad&quot; sound defining the harmony progression. Typically, a rich &quot;<a href="wall_of_sound" title="wikilink">wall of sound</a>&quot; results. There are, however, more minimalistic flavors of disco with reduced, transparent instrumentation, pioneered by <a href="Chic_(band)" title="wikilink">Chic (band)</a>.</p>
<p>In 1977, <a href="Giorgio_Moroder" title="wikilink">Giorgio Moroder</a> again became responsible for a development in disco. Alongside <a href="Donna_Summer" title="wikilink">Donna Summer</a> and <a href="Pete_Bellotte" title="wikilink">Pete Bellotte</a> he wrote the song &quot;<a href="I_Feel_Love" title="wikilink">I Feel Love</a>&quot; for Summer to perform. It became the first well-known disco hit to have a completely synthesised backing track. The song is still considered to have been well ahead of its time. Other disco producers, most famously <a href="Tom_Moulton" title="wikilink">Tom Moulton</a>, grabbed ideas and techniques from dub music (which came with the increased <a href="Jamaican" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jamaican</a> migration to New York City in the seventies) to provide alternatives to the four on the floor style that dominated. <a href="Larry_Levan" title="wikilink">Larry Levan</a> utilized style keys from <a href="Dub_music" title="wikilink">dub</a> and <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a> and more as one of the most successful remixers of all time to create early versions of <a href="house_music" title="wikilink">house music</a> that sparked the genre.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="production">Production</h3>
<p>The &quot;disco sound&quot; was much more costly to produce than many of the other popular music genres from the 1970s. Unlike the simpler, four-piece band sound of the funk, soul of the late 1960s, or the small <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a> <a href="organ_trio" title="wikilink">organ trios</a>, disco music often included a large pop band, with several chordal instruments (guitar, keyboards, synthesizer), several drum or percussion instruments (drumkit, Latin percussion, electronic drums), a <a href="horn_section" title="wikilink">horn section</a>, a <a href="string_orchestra" title="wikilink">string orchestra</a>, and a variety of &quot;classical&quot; solo instruments (for example, flute, piccolo, and so on).</p>
<p>Disco songs were <a href="arrangement" title="wikilink">arranged</a> and composed by experienced arrangers and <a href="orchestration" title="wikilink">orchestrators</a>, and producers added their creative touches to the overall sound. Recording complex arrangements with such a large number of instruments and sections required a team that included a <a href="Conductor_(music)" title="wikilink">conductor</a>, <a href="copyist" title="wikilink">copyists</a>, <a href="record_producer" title="wikilink">record producers</a>, and <a href="audio_engineering" title="wikilink">mixing engineers</a>. Mixing engineers had an important role in the disco production process, because disco songs used as many as 64 <a href="sound_recording" title="wikilink">tracks</a> of vocals and instruments. Mixing engineers compiled these tracks into a fluid composition of verses, bridges, and refrains, complete with <a href="orchestral_build" title="wikilink">orchestral builds</a> and <a href="break_(music)" title="wikilink">breaks</a>. Mixing engineers helped to develop the &quot;disco sound&quot; by creating a distinctive-sounding <a href="disco_mix" title="wikilink">disco mix</a>.</p>
<p>Early records were the &quot;standard&quot; 3 minute version until <a href="Tom_Moulton" title="wikilink">Tom Moulton</a> came up with a way to make songs longer, wanting to take a crowd to another level that was impossible with 45-RPM vinyl discs of the time (which could usually hold no more than 5 minutes of good-quality music). With the help of Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Rodriguez, his remasterer, he pressed a single on a 10&quot; disc instead of 7&quot;. They cut the next single on a 12&quot; disc, the same format as a standard album. This method fast became the standard format for all DJs of the genre.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>Because record sales were often dependent on floor play in clubs, <a href="disc_jockey" title="wikilink">DJs</a> were also important to the development and popularization of disco music. Notable DJs include Rex Potts (Loft Lounge, Sarasota, Florida), Karen Cook, <a href="Jim_Burgess_(producer)" title="wikilink">Jim Burgess</a>, <a href="Walter_Gibbons" title="wikilink">Walter Gibbons</a>, <a href="John_&quot;Jellybean&quot;_Benitez" title="wikilink">John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez</a>, Richie Kaczar of <a href="Studio_54" title="wikilink">Studio 54</a>, Rick Gianatos, <a href="Francis_Grasso" title="wikilink">Francis Grasso</a> of Sanctuary, <a href="Larry_Levan" title="wikilink">Larry Levan</a>, <a href="Ian_Levine" title="wikilink">Ian Levine</a>, Neil &quot;Raz&quot; Rasmussen &amp; Mike Pace of L'amour Disco in Brooklyn, Preston Powell of Magique, Jennie Costa of Lemontrees, Tee Scott, Tony Smith of <a href="Xenon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xenon</a>, John Luongo, Robert Ouimet of <a href="The_Limelight" title="wikilink">The Limelight</a>, and <a href="David_Mancuso" title="wikilink">David Mancuso</a>.</p>
<h2 id="disco-clubs-and-culture">Disco clubs and culture</h2>
<p><img src="Blue_disco_quad_roller_skates.jpg" title="fig:Blue disco quad roller skates." alt="Blue disco quad roller skates." width="250" /> By the late 1970s most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes, but the largest scenes were in <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a>, <a href="Miami" class="uri" title="wikilink">Miami</a>, and most notably <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>. The scene was centered on <a href="discotheque" title="wikilink">discotheques</a>, nightclubs, and private loft parties where <a href="DJ" title="wikilink">DJs</a> would play disco hits through powerful <a href="PA_system" title="wikilink">PA systems</a> for the patrons who came to dance. The DJs played &quot;...a smooth mix of long single records to keep people 'dancing all night long'&quot;.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Some of the most prestigious clubs had elaborate lighting systems that throbbed to the beat of the music.</p>
<p>At the height of the disco era, McFaddin Ventures were operating many successful and profitable nightclubs. In an effort to maximize profit, McFaddin Ventures in Houston, Texas commissioned a study on the stimulation of males and females during the playing of music. They accordingly custom tuned their speakers to make their numerous clubs more exciting.</p>
<p>In October 1975 notable discos included &quot;Studio One&quot; in Los Angeles, &quot;Leviticus&quot; in New York and &quot;The Library&quot; in Atlanta.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> The library Disco chain had locations in New City, Syracuse N.Y., Pittsburgh Pa., a short lived version in Denver, Co. as well as Atlanta Ga.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, <a href="Studio_54" title="wikilink">Studio 54</a> was arguably the most well known nightclub in the world. This club played a major formative role in the growth of disco music and <a href="nightclub" class="uri" title="wikilink">nightclub</a> culture in general.</p>
<h3 id="disco-dancing">Disco dancing</h3>
<p>In the early years dancers in discos danced in a &quot;hang loose&quot; style. Popular dances included &quot;Bump&quot;, &quot;Penguin&quot;, &quot;Boogaloo&quot;, &quot;Watergate&quot; and the &quot;Robot&quot;. By October 1975 <a href="Hustle_(dance)" title="wikilink">The Hustle</a> reigned. It was highly stylized, sophisticated and overtly sexual. Variations included the <a href="Brooklyn_Hustle" title="wikilink">Brooklyn Hustle</a>, <a href="New_York_Hustle" title="wikilink">New York Hustle</a> and <a href="Latin_Hustle" title="wikilink">Latin Hustle</a>.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>During the disco era, many nightclubs would commonly host disco dance competitions or offer free instructional lessons. Some cities had disco dance instructors or dance schools, which taught people how to do popular disco dances such as <em>&quot;<a href="touch_dancing" title="wikilink">touch dancing</a>,</em> <em>&quot;the hustle,</em> and <em><a href="Cha-cha-cha_(dance)" title="wikilink">the cha cha</a>.</em> The pioneer of disco dance instruction was Karen Lustgarten in San Francisco in 1973. Her book The Complete Guide to Disco Dancing (Warner Books, 1978) was the first to name, break down and codify popular disco dances as a dance form and distinguish between disco freestyle, partner and line dances. The book hit the New York Times Best Seller List for 13 weeks and was translated into Chinese, German and French.</p>
<p>Some notable professional dance troupes of the 1970s included <a href="Pan&#39;s_People" title="wikilink">Pan's People</a> and <a href="Hot_Gossip" title="wikilink">Hot Gossip</a>. For many dancers, the primary influence of the 1970s disco age is still predominantly the film <em><a href="Saturday_Night_Fever" title="wikilink">Saturday Night Fever</a></em> (1977). This developed into the music and dance style of such films as <em><a href="Fame_(1980_film)" title="wikilink">Fame</a></em> (1980), <em><a href="Flashdance" class="uri" title="wikilink">Flashdance</a></em> (1983), and <em><a href="The_Last_Days_of_Disco" title="wikilink">The Last Days of Disco</a></em> (1998). It also helped spawn dance competition TV shows such as <a href="Dance_Fever" title="wikilink">Dance Fever</a> (1979).</p>
<h3 id="disco-fashion">Disco fashion</h3>
<p>Disco fashions were very trendy in the late 1970s. Discoth&lt;U+00E8&gt;que-goers often wore expensive and extravagant fashions for nights out at their local disco, such as sheer, flowing <a href="Halston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Halston</a> dresses for women and shiny polyester <a href="Qiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qiana</a> shirts for men with pointy collars, preferably open at the chest, often worn with <a href="Double_knitting" title="wikilink">double-knit</a> polyester shirt jackets with matching trousers known as the leisure suit. <a href="Necklace" title="wikilink">Necklaces</a> and <a href="medal" title="wikilink">medallions</a> were a common <a href="fashion_accessory" title="wikilink">fashion accessory</a>.</p>
<h3 id="drug-subculture-and-sexual-promiscuity">Drug subculture and sexual promiscuity</h3>
<p>In addition to the dance and fashion aspects of the disco club scene, there was also a thriving drug <a href="subculture" class="uri" title="wikilink">subculture</a>, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights, such as <a href="cocaine" class="uri" title="wikilink">cocaine</a><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> (nicknamed &quot;blow&quot;), amyl nitrite &quot;<a href="poppers" class="uri" title="wikilink">poppers</a>&quot;,<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> and the &quot;...other quintessential 1970s club drug <a href="Quaalude" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quaalude</a>, which suspended <a href="motor_coordination" title="wikilink">motor coordination</a> and gave the sensation that one&lt;U+2019&gt;s arms and legs had turned to <a href="Jell-O" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jell-O</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> According to <a href="Peter_Braunstein" title="wikilink">Peter Braunstein</a>, the &quot;massive quantities of drugs ingested in discotheques produced the next <a href="cultural_phenomenon" title="wikilink">cultural phenomenon</a> of the disco era: rampant <a href="promiscuity" class="uri" title="wikilink">promiscuity</a> and <a href="public_sex" title="wikilink">public sex</a>. While the dance floor was the central arena of <a href="seduction" class="uri" title="wikilink">seduction</a>, actual sex usually took place in the nether regions of the disco: bathroom stalls, exit <a href="stairwell" title="wikilink">stairwells</a>, and so on. In other cases the disco became a kind of 'main course' in a hedonist's menu for a night out.&quot;<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="u20131990-post-disco-and-dance">1982&lt;U+2013&gt;1990: Post-disco and dance </h3>

<p>The transition from the late-1970s disco styles to the early-1980s dance styles was marked primarily by the change from complex arrangements performed by <a href="big_band" title="wikilink">large ensembles</a> of studio session musicians (including a <a href="horn_section" title="wikilink">horn section</a> and an orchestral <a href="string_section" title="wikilink">string section</a>), to a leaner sound, in which one or two singers would perform to the accompaniment of <a href="synthesizer" class="uri" title="wikilink">synthesizer</a> <a href="Keyboard_instrument" title="wikilink">keyboards</a> and <a href="drum_machine" title="wikilink">drum machines</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="dance_music" title="wikilink">dance music</a> during the 1981&lt;U+2013&gt;83 period borrowed elements from <a href="blues" class="uri" title="wikilink">blues</a> and <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a>, creating a style different from the disco of the 1970s. This emerging music was still known as disco for a short time, as the word had become associated with any kind of dance music played in <a href="discoth&lt;U+00E8&gt;que" title="wikilink">discoth&lt;U+00E8&gt;ques</a>. Examples of early 1980s dance sound performers include <a href="D._Train" title="wikilink">D. Train</a>, <a href="Kashif_(musician)" title="wikilink">Kashif</a>, and <a href="Patrice_Rushen" title="wikilink">Patrice Rushen</a>. These changes were influenced by some of the notable R&amp;B and jazz musicians of the 1970s, such as Stevie Wonder, Kashif and <a href="Herbie_Hancock" title="wikilink">Herbie Hancock</a>, who had pioneered &quot;<a href="Multi-instrumentalist" title="wikilink">one-man-band</a>&quot;-type keyboard techniques. Some of these influences had already begun to emerge during the mid-1970s, at the height of disco&lt;U+2019&gt;s popularity.</p>
<p>During the first years of the 1980s, the disco sound began to be phased out, and faster tempos and synthesized effects, accompanied by guitar and simplified backgrounds, moved dance music toward the funk and pop genres. This trend can be seen in singer <a href="Billy_Ocean" title="wikilink">Billy Ocean</a>'s recordings between 1979 and 1981. Whereas Ocean's 1979 song <em>American Hearts</em> was backed with an orchestral arrangement played by the <a href="Los_Angeles_Symphony_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra</a>, his 1981 song <em>&quot;One of Those Nights (Feel Like Gettin' Down)&quot;</em> had a more bare, stripped-down sound, with no orchestration or <a href="symphonic" class="uri" title="wikilink">symphonic</a> arrangements. This drift from the original disco sound is called <a href="post-disco" class="uri" title="wikilink">post-disco</a>. In this music scene there are rooted sub-genres, such as <a href="italo-disco" class="uri" title="wikilink">italo-disco</a>, <a href="techno" class="uri" title="wikilink">techno</a>, <a href="house_music" title="wikilink">house</a>, <a href="dance-pop" class="uri" title="wikilink">dance-pop</a>, <a href="boogie_(genre)" title="wikilink">boogie</a>, and early <a href="alternative_dance" title="wikilink">alternative dance</a>.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> During the early 1980s, dance music dropped the complicated melodic structure and orchestration that typified the disco sound.</p>
<h3 id="tv-themes">TV themes</h3>
<p>During the 1970s, many TV theme songs were produced (or older themes updated) with disco influenced music. Examples include <em><a href="S.W.A.T._(TV_Series)" title="wikilink">S.W.A.T.</a></em> (1975), <em><a href="Charlie&#39;s_Angels" title="wikilink">Charlie's Angels</a></em> (1976), <em>NBC Saturday Night At The Movies</em> (1976), <em><a href="The_Love_Boat" title="wikilink">The Love Boat</a></em> (1977), <em><a href="The_Donahue_Show" title="wikilink">The Donahue Show</a></em> (1977), <em><a href="CHiPs" class="uri" title="wikilink">CHiPs</a></em> (1977), <em><a href="The_Professionals_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">The Professionals</a></em> (1977), <em><a href="Dallas_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Dallas</a></em> (1978), <em><a href="Kojak" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kojak</a></em> (1978), <em><a href="The_Hollywood_Squares" title="wikilink">The Hollywood Squares</a></em> (1979). The British Science Fiction program <em><a href="Space:_1999" title="wikilink">Space: 1999</a></em> (1975) also featured a soundtrack strongly influenced by disco. This was especially evident in the show's second season.</p>
<h3 id="dj-culture">DJ culture</h3>
<p>The rising popularity of disco came in tandem with developments in <a href="turntablism" class="uri" title="wikilink">turntablism</a> and the use of records to create a continuous mix of songs. The resulting <a href="DJ_mix" title="wikilink">DJ mix</a> differed from previous forms of dance music, which were oriented towards live performances by musicians. This in turn affected the arrangement of dance music, with songs since the disco era typically containing beginnings and endings marked by a simple beat or riff that can be easily slipped into the mix.</p>
<h3 id="rave-culture">Rave culture</h3>

<p>As the Disco era came to a close in the late 1970s, <a href="rave" class="uri" title="wikilink">rave</a> culture began to see significant growth. Rave culture incorporated disco culture's same love of dance music, drug exploration, sexual promiscuity, and <a href="hedonism" class="uri" title="wikilink">hedonism</a>. Although disco culture had thrived in the mainstream, the rave culture would make an effort to stay underground to avoid the animosity that was still surrounding disco and dance music.</p>
<h3 id="hip-hop-and-electro">Hip hop and electro</h3>
<p>The disco sound had a strong influence on early <a href="hip_hop_music" title="wikilink">hip hop</a>. Most of the early rap/hip-hop songs were created by isolating existing disco bass-guitar lines and dubbing over them with MC rhymes. <a href="The_Sugarhill_Gang" title="wikilink">The Sugarhill Gang</a> used <a href="Chic_(band)" title="wikilink">Chic</a>'s &quot;<a href="Good_Times_(Chic_song)" title="wikilink">Good Times</a>&quot; as the foundation for their 1979 hit &quot;<a href="Rapper&#39;s_Delight" title="wikilink">Rapper's Delight</a>&quot;, generally considered to be the song that first popularized rap music in the United States and around the world. In 1982, <a href="Afrika_Bambataa" title="wikilink">Afrika Bambataa</a> released the single &quot;<a href="Planet_Rock_(song)" title="wikilink">Planet Rock</a>&quot;, which incorporated <a href="electronica" class="uri" title="wikilink">electronica</a> elements from <a href="Kraftwerk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kraftwerk</a>'s &quot;<a href="Trans-Europe_Express_(album)" title="wikilink">Trans-Europe Express</a>&quot; and &quot;Numbers&quot; as well as <a href="Yellow_Magic_Orchestra" title="wikilink">YMO</a>'s &quot;Riot in Lagos&quot;. The Planet Rock sound also spawned a <a href="hip-hop" class="uri" title="wikilink">hip-hop</a> <a href="Electronic_dance_music" title="wikilink">electronic dance</a> trend, <a href="electro_music" title="wikilink">electro music</a>, which included songs such as <a href="Planet_Patrol" title="wikilink">Planet Patrol</a>'s &quot;Play at Your Own Risk&quot; (1982), C Bank's &quot;One More Shot&quot; (1982), <a href="Cerrone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cerrone</a>'s &quot;Club Underworld&quot; (1984), <a href="Shannon_(singer)" title="wikilink">Shannon</a>'s &quot;<a href="Let_the_Music_Play_(song)" title="wikilink">Let the Music Play</a>&quot; (1983), <a href="Freeez" class="uri" title="wikilink">Freeez</a>'s &quot;I.O.U.&quot; (1983), <a href="Midnight_Star" title="wikilink">Midnight Star</a>'s &quot;Freak-a-Zoid&quot; (1983), <a href="Chaka_Khan" title="wikilink">Chaka Khan</a>'s &quot;<a href="I_Feel_For_You" title="wikilink">I Feel For You</a>&quot; (1984).</p>
<h3 id="post-punk">Post-punk </h3>

<p>The <a href="post-punk" class="uri" title="wikilink">post-punk</a> movement that originated in the late 1970s both supported <a href="punk_rock" title="wikilink">punk rock</a>'s rule breaking while rejecting its back to raw <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock music</a> element.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Post-punk's mantra of constantly moving forward lent itself to both openness to and experimentation with elements of disco and other styles.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> <a href="Public_Image_Limited" title="wikilink">Public Image Limited</a> is considered the first post-punk group.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The group's second album <em><a href="Metal_Box" title="wikilink">Metal Box</a></em> fully embraced the studio as instrument methodology of disco.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> The group's founder <a href="John_Lydon" title="wikilink">John Lydon</a> told the press that disco was the only music he cared for at the time. <a href="No_Wave" title="wikilink">No Wave</a> was a sub genre of post-punk centered in New York City.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>For shock value, <a href="James_Chance" title="wikilink">James Chance</a> who was a notable member of the No Wave scene penned an article in the <a href="East_Village_Eye" title="wikilink">East Village Eye</a> urging his readers to move uptown and get &quot;trancin' with some superadioactive disco voodoo funk&quot;. His band <a href="James_White_and_the_Blacks" title="wikilink">James White and the Blacks</a> wrote a disco album <em><a href="Off_White" title="wikilink">Off White</a></em>.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Their performances resembled those of disco performers (horn section, dancers and so on).<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> In 1981 <a href="ZE_Records" title="wikilink">ZE Records</a> led the transition from No Wave into the more subtle <a href="mutant_disco" title="wikilink">mutant disco</a> (<a href="Post-disco#Dance-rock" title="wikilink">post-disco/punk</a>) genre.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Mutant disco acts such as <a href="Kid_Creole_and_the_Coconuts" title="wikilink">Kid Creole and the Coconuts</a>, <a href="Was_Not_Was" title="wikilink">Was Not Was</a>, <a href="ESG_(band)" title="wikilink">ESG</a> and <a href="Liquid_Liquid" title="wikilink">Liquid Liquid</a> influenced several British post-punk acts such as <a href="New_Order" title="wikilink">New Order</a>, <a href="Orange_Juice" title="wikilink">Orange Juice</a> and <a href="A_Certain_Ratio" title="wikilink">A Certain Ratio</a>.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="dance-punk">Dance-punk</h4>

<p>In the early 2000s the dance-punk (<a href="new_rave" title="wikilink">new rave</a> in the United Kingdom) emerged as a part of a broader <a href="post_punk_revival" title="wikilink">post punk revival</a>. It fused elements of punk related rock with different forms of dance music including disco. <a href="Klaxons" class="uri" title="wikilink">Klaxons</a>, <a href="LCD_Soundsystem" title="wikilink">LCD Soundsystem</a>, <a href="Death_From_Above_1979" title="wikilink">Death From Above 1979</a>, <a href="The_Rapture_(band)" title="wikilink">The Rapture</a> and <a href="Shitdisco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shitdisco</a> were among acts associated with the genre.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a><a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a><a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a><a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="nu-disco">Nu-disco</h3>

<p>Nu-disco is a 21st century dance music genre associated with the renewed interest in 1970s and early 1980s disco,<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> mid-1980s Italo disco, and the synthesizer-heavy Eurodisco aesthetics.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> The moniker appeared in print as early as 2002, and by mid-2008 was used by record shops such as the online retailers Juno and Beatport.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> These vendors often associate it with re-edits of original-era disco music, as well as with music from European producers who make dance music inspired by original-era American disco, electro and other genres popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It is also used to describe the music on several American labels that were previously associated with the genres <a href="electroclash" class="uri" title="wikilink">electroclash</a> and <a href="deep_house" title="wikilink">deep house</a>.</p>

Nitrites originally came as small glass capsules that were popped open. This led to nitrites being given the name 'poppers' but this form of the drug is rarely found in the UK. The drug became popular in the UK first on the disco/club scene of the 1970s and then at dance and rave venues in the 1980s and 1990s.<a href="#fnref85" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
