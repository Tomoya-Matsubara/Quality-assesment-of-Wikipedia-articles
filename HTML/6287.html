<p>The lyrics <em>&quot;Slanted eyes meet a new sunrise / A race of bodies small in size / Chicken Chow Mein and Chop Suey / Hong Kong garden takeaway&quot;</em> and the song itself could be interpreted as an ode to Chinese food restaurateurs whose culture is or was regarded with contempt by some non-Chinese in Britain.</p>
