<p><strong>Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher</strong> <a href="Order_of_the_Garter" title="wikilink">LG</a>, <a href="Order_of_Merit" title="wikilink">OM</a>, <a href="Her_Majesty&#39;s_Most_Honourable_Privy_Council" title="wikilink">PC</a>, <a href="Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society" title="wikilink">FRS</a> (born 13 October 1925) served as <a href="Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a> from 1979 to 1990 and <a href="Leader_of_the_Conservative_Party" title="wikilink">Leader</a> of the <a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Conservative Party</a> from 1975 to 1990. She is the only woman to have held either post.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Born in <a href="Grantham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grantham</a> in <a href="Lincolnshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lincolnshire</a>, <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, she read chemistry at <a href="Somerville_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Somerville College, Oxford</a> and later trained as a <a href="barrister" class="uri" title="wikilink">barrister</a>. She won a seat in the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1959" title="wikilink">1959 general election</a>, becoming the MP for <a href="Finchley_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Finchley</a> as a Conservative. When <a href="Edward_Heath" title="wikilink">Edward Heath</a> formed a government in 1970, he appointed Thatcher <a href="Secretary_of_State_for_Education_and_Skills" title="wikilink">Secretary of State for Education and Science</a>. Four years later, she backed <a href="Keith_Joseph" title="wikilink">Keith Joseph</a> in his bid to become Conservative Party leader but he was forced to drop out of the <a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)_leadership_election,_1975" title="wikilink">election</a>. In 1975 Thatcher entered the contest herself and became leader of the Conservative Party. At the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1979" title="wikilink">1979 general election</a> she became Britain's first female Prime Minister.</p>
<p>In her foreword to the 1979 Conservative manifesto, Thatcher had written of &quot;a feeling of helplessness, that a once great nation has somehow fallen behind.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> She entered <a href="10_Downing_Street" title="wikilink">10 Downing Street</a> determined to reverse what she perceived as a precipitate national decline, characterised by a combination of high inflation, high unemployment and stagnant or slow growth. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation, particularly of the financial sector, flexible labour markets, and the selling off of <a href="Government-owned_corporation" title="wikilink">state owned companies</a>. Amid a recession and high unemployment, Thatcher's popularity decreased, though economic recovery and the 1982 <a href="Falklands_War" title="wikilink">Falklands War</a> brought a resurgence of support and she was re-elected in 1983. She took a hard line against trade unions, survived the <a href="Brighton_hotel_bombing" title="wikilink">Brighton hotel bombing</a> assassination attempt and opposed the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> (her tough-talking rhetoric gained her the nickname the &quot;<a href="Iron_Lady" title="wikilink">Iron Lady</a>&quot;); she was re-elected for an unprecedented third term in 1987. The following years would prove difficult, as her <a href="Community_Charge" title="wikilink">Poll tax</a> plan was largely unpopular, and her views regarding the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Community</a> were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She resigned as Prime Minister in November 1990 after <a href="Michael_Heseltine" title="wikilink">Michael Heseltine</a>'s challenge to her <a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)_leadership_election,_1990" title="wikilink">leadership of the Conservative Party</a>.</p>
<p>Thatcher's tenure as Prime Minister was the longest since that of <a href="Robert_Gascoyne-Cecil,_3rd_Marquess_of_Salisbury" title="wikilink">Lord Salisbury</a> and the longest continuous period in office since <a href="Robert_Jenkinson,_2nd_Earl_of_Liverpool" title="wikilink">Lord Liverpool</a> in the early 19th century.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> She was the first woman to lead a major political party in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>, and the first of only three women to hold any of the four <a href="great_offices_of_state" title="wikilink">great offices of state</a>. She holds a <a href="life_peerage" title="wikilink">life peerage</a> as Baroness Thatcher, of <a href="Kesteven" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kesteven</a> in the County of Lincolnshire, which entitles her to sit in the <a href="House_of_Lords" title="wikilink">House of Lords</a>.</p>

<p>Thatcher established herself as a potent conference speaker at the Conservative Party Conference of 1966, with a strong attack on the high-tax policies of the Labour Government as being steps &quot;not only towards Socialism, but towards Communism&quot;.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> She argued that lower taxes served as an incentive to hard work.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Thatcher was one of few Conservative MPs to support <a href="Leo_Abse" title="wikilink">Leo Abse</a>'s Bill to decriminalise male homosexuality and voted in favour of <a href="David_Steel" title="wikilink">David Steel</a>'s Bill to legalise abortion,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> as well as a ban on <a href="hare_coursing" title="wikilink">hare coursing</a>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> She supported the retention of capital punishment and voted against the relaxation of divorce laws.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

In her first months in office, Thatcher came to public attention as a result of the administration of Edward Heath's decision to cut spending. She gave priority to academic needs in schools,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> and imposed public expenditure cuts on the state education system, resulting in, against her private protests, the abolition of free milk for school-children aged seven to eleven.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> She believed that few children would suffer if schools were charged for milk, however she agreed to give younger children a third of a pint, daily, for nutritional purposes.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> This provoked a storm of protest from the Labour party and the press,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> and led to the unflattering moniker &quot;Margaret Thatcher, Milk Snatcher&quot;.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Of the experience, Thatcher later wrote in her autobiography, &quot;I learned a valuable lesson.

<p>The Heath government experienced many difficulties between 1970 and 1974.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The government executed a series of reversals in its economic policies, dubbed &quot;U-turns&quot;.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The Conservatives were defeated in the February <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_February_1974" title="wikilink">1974 general election</a>, and Thatcher's portfolio was changed to Shadow Environment Secretary.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> In this position she promised to abolish the <a href="Poll_tax#United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">rating system</a> that paid for local government services, which was a favoured policy proposal within the Conservative Party for many years.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>Thatcher thought that the Heath Government had lost control of <a href="monetary_policy" title="wikilink">monetary policy</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;and had lost direction.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> After her party lost the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_October_1974" title="wikilink">second election of 1974</a> in October, Thatcher, determined to change the direction of the Conservative party, challenged Heath for the Conservative party leadership.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> She promised a fresh start, and her main support came from the Conservative <a href="1922_Committee" title="wikilink">1922 Committee</a>.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Unexpectedly, she <a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)_leadership_election,_1975" title="wikilink">defeated Heath</a> on the first ballot, and he resigned the leadership.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> On the second ballot, she defeated Heath's preferred successor, <a href="William_Whitelaw" title="wikilink">William Whitelaw</a>, and became Conservative Party leader on 11 February 1975.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> She appointed Whitelaw as her deputy.

<p>Now that the Heath government had fallen, Thatcher, &quot;renewed [her] reading of the seminal works of liberal economics and conservative thought. I also regularly attended lunches at the <a href="Institute_of_Economic_Affairs" title="wikilink">Institute of Economic Affairs</a> where <a href="Ralph_Harris,_Baron_Harris_of_High_Cross" title="wikilink">Ralph Harris</a>, <a href="Arthur_Seldon" title="wikilink">Arthur Seldon</a> and all those who had been right, when we in Government had gone so badly wrong..were busy <em>marking out a new path for Britain</em>. &quot; (The IEA, a think tank founded by the poultry magnate <a href="Antony_Fisher" title="wikilink">Antony Fisher</a>, the man who brought <a href="battery_farming" title="wikilink">battery farming</a> to Britain and a disciple of <a href="Friedrich_von_Hayek" title="wikilink">Friedrich von Hayek</a>, had become the ideas factory of a new British Conservatism. Thatcher began visiting the IEA and reading its publications during the early sixties.) Thatcher would now become the face of the ideological movement that felt the opposite of reverence for the <a href="welfare_state" title="wikilink">welfare state</a> <a href="Keynesian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Keynesian</a> economics they believed was <em>terminally weakening</em> Britain. &quot; Whatever the question the institute's pamphlets posed, their answer was basicaly identical: less government, lower taxes, more freedom for business and consumers.&quot; <a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>In these years Thatcher began to work on her image, specifically her voice and screen image. &quot;The hang-up has always been the voice&quot; wrote the critic <a href="Clive_James" title="wikilink">Clive James</a>, in <em><a href="The_Observer" title="wikilink">The Observer</a>.</em> &quot;Not the timbre so much as, well, the <em>tone</em> - the condescending explanatory whine which treats the squirming interlocutor as an eight-year-old child with learning deficiencies. <em>News Extra</em> rolled a clip from May 1973 demonstrating the Thatcher sneer at full pitch. She sounded like a <em>cat sliding down a blackboard</em>.&quot; She worked to change this image and James acknowledged: &quot;She's <em>cold</em>, <em>hard</em>, quick and superior, and smart enough to know that those qualities could work <em>for</em> her instead of against.&quot; <a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>Thatcher appointed many of Heath's supporters to the Shadow Cabinet, for she had won the leadership as an outsider and then had little power base of her own within the party. Thatcher had to act cautiously to convert the Conservative Party to her <a href="monetarist" class="uri" title="wikilink">monetarist</a> beliefs. She reversed Heath's support for <a href="devolved_government" title="wikilink">devolved government</a> for <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>.</p>
<p>On 19 January 1976, she made a speech in Kensington Town Hall in which she made a scathing attack on the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>. The most famous part of her speech ran:</p>

<p>In response, the Soviet Defence Ministry newspaper <em><a href="Krasnaya_Zvezda" title="wikilink">Krasnaya Zvezda</a></em> (<em>Red Star</em>) gave her the nickname &quot;<a href="Iron_Lady" title="wikilink">Iron Lady</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> She took delight in the name and it soon became associated with her image as having an unwavering and steadfast character.

<p>In an interview in January 1978,on the television current-affairs programme <em><a href="World_in_Action" title="wikilink">World in Action</a></em> Thatcher raised the prospect of the number of Pakistani and Commonwealth Britons doubling to four million by the end of the century, remarking: &quot;People are really rather afraid that this country might be swamped by people with a different culture&quot;.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Thatcher was condemned for the language and content of her remarks by <a href="James_Callaghan" title="wikilink">Callaghan</a> and <a href="Denis_Healey" title="wikilink">Healey</a>, by bishops, by the Liberal leader <a href="David_Steel" title="wikilink">David Steel</a> and, in private, by some shadow cabinet colleagues. <a href="Enoch_Powell" title="wikilink">Enoch Powell</a> expressed his 'hope and relief' at her words. &quot;By the sixties and seventies, with British imperial pride receding fast and a debate about national decline established in its place, Commonwealth immigration could look, to a certain kind of British patriot, less like a healthy post-imperial exchange and more like a national defeat: an invasion of territory of the kind previously mounted by Britain against other states.&quot; <a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Thatcher received 10,000 letters thanking her for raising the subject of immigration, and the Conservatives, previously level with Labour on 43% in opinion polls, took a 48% to 39% lead.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> &quot;Before my interview, the opinion polls showed us level-pegging with Labour.

<p>In spite of economic recovery in the late seventies and recovery in average disposable income from 1977 onwards, the Labour Government was faced with unease about the direction of the country, and eventually, 'a sudden nationwide revolt against the <a href="Social_Contract_(Britain)" title="wikilink">Social Contract</a>, during the winter of 1978&lt;U+2013&gt;79, popularly dubbed the &quot;<a href="Winter_of_Discontent" title="wikilink">Winter of Discontent</a>&quot;. 'Party in grip of mild euphoria,' wrote Thatcher's adviser <a href="John_Hoskyns" title="wikilink">John Hoskyns</a> in his diary on 18 January, 'because country beset by strikes..' The Conservatives attacked the government's unemployment record, and used advertising hoardings with the slogan <em>Labour Isn't Working</em> to assist them.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> When the rough poster was shown to Thatcher, &quot;She stared at it for a long time; the convention in party propaganda was not to mention the opponent directly. 'Why is the biggest thing on the poster the name of the opposition? We're advertising Labour,' she said. Tim Bell (Saatchis managing director) and <a href="Maurice_Saatchi" title="wikilink">Maurice Saatchi</a> replied, almost in unison, 'No, we're demolishing Labour.' &quot; <a href="Denis_Healey" title="wikilink">Denis Healey</a> criticised <a href="Saatchi_&amp;_Saatchi" title="wikilink">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi</a> for having staged the photograph with Saatchi employees.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> In fact the advertisers had used a group of twenty <a href="Young_Conservatives" title="wikilink">Young Conservatives</a> from South Hendon &quot;photographed over and over&quot;. <a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The Saatchi campaign unsettled Labour at a crucial moment. Unemployment would often be much worse in the next decade without bringing down Thatcher's government. <a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>In the run up to the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1979" title="wikilink">1979 General Election</a>, most opinion polls showed that voters preferred <a href="James_Callaghan" title="wikilink">James Callaghan</a> of the Labour party as Prime Minister, even as the Conservative Party maintained a lead in the polls. After a successful <a href="1979_vote_of_no_confidence_against_the_government_of_James_Callaghan" title="wikilink">motion of no confidence in spring 1979</a>, Callaghan's Labour government fell. The Conservatives would go on to win a 44-seat majority in the House of Commons and Margaret Thatcher became the United Kingdom's first female Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Thatcher was incensed by one contemporary view within the British Civil Service that its job was to manage the UK's decline from the days of Empire and she wanted the country to assert a higher level of influence and leadership in international affairs. She represented the newly energetic right wing of the Conservative Party and advocated greater independence of the individual from the state and less government intervention.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> She became a very close ally, philosophically and politically, with President of the United States <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Ronald Reagan</a>, elected in 1980.

<p>Thatcher's political and economic philosophy emphasised reduced state intervention, <a href="free_market" title="wikilink">free markets</a>, and entrepreneurialism.

The &quot;productivity miracle&quot; observed in British industry under Thatcher was achieved not so much by increasing the overall productivity of labour as by reducing workforces and increasing unemployment.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> A number of the privatised industries, such as gas, water and electricity, were <a href="natural_monopolies" title="wikilink">natural monopolies</a> for which privatisation involved little increase in competition. Furthermore, the privatised industries that underwent improvements often did so while still under state ownership. For instance, <a href="British_Steel" title="wikilink">British Steel</a> made great gains in profitability while still a nationalised industry under the government-appointed chairmanship of <a href="Ian_MacGregor" title="wikilink">Ian MacGregor</a>, who faced down trade-union opposition to close plants and more than halve the workforce.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> Regulation was also greatly expanded to compensate for the loss of direct government control, with the foundation of regulatory bodies like <a href="Ofgas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ofgas</a>, <a href="Oftel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oftel</a> and the <a href="National_Rivers_Authority" title="wikilink">National Rivers Authority</a>.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> Overall, there was no clear pattern between the degree of competition, regulation and performance among the privatised industries.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> While the output and profits of the privatised companies grew, margins increased, and employment declined, the exact relationship of these changes to privatisation is uncertain.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
<p>Many people took advantage of share offers, although many sold their shares immediately for a quick profit and therefore the proportion of shares held by individuals rather than institutions did not increase. By the mid 1980s, the number of individual stockholders had tripled, and the Thatcher government had sold 1.5 million publicly owned housing units to their tenants.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>
<p>The privatisation of public assets was combined with deregulation of finance in an attempt to fuel economic growth. Notably, in 1979 Geoffrey Howe abolished Britain's exchange controls to allow more capital to seek profits overseas and the <a href="Big_Bang_(financial_markets)" title="wikilink">Big Bang</a> of 1986 removed many restrictions on the activities of the <a href="London_Stock_Exchange" title="wikilink">London Stock Exchange</a>. The Thatcher government encouraged the growth of the financial and service sectors to replace Britain's ailing manufacturing industry. <a href="Susan_Strange" title="wikilink">Susan Strange</a> called this new financial growth model, flourishing in Britain and America under Thatcher and Reagan, &quot;casino capitalism&quot; - as speculation and trading in financial claims became a more important part of the economy than industry.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="trade-unions">Trade unions</h4>

<p>Thatcher was committed to reducing the power of the trade unions, whose leadership she accused of undermining parliamentary democracy and economic performance through paralysing strike action.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> Several unions launched strikes in response to legislation introduced to curb their power, but resistance eventually collapsed.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> Only 39% of union members voted for Labour in the 1983 general election.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> According to the BBC, Thatcher &quot;managed to destroy the power of the trade unions for almost a generation.&quot;<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
<p>The number of stoppages across the United Kingdom peaked at 4,583 in the crisis year of 1979 that brought Thatcher to power, with over 29 million working days lost. 1984, the great year of industrial confrontation with the <a href="National_Union_of_Mineworkers_(Great_Britain)" title="wikilink">National Union of Mineworkers</a> (NUM), saw 1,221 stoppages and over 27 million working days lost. Stoppages then fell steadily through the rest of Thatcher's premiership, to 630 by 1990, with under 2 million working days lost, and continued to fall thereafter.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> Trade union membership also fell, from over 12 million in 1979 to 8.4 million in 1990.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="UK_miners&#39;_strike_(1984&lt;U+2013&gt;1985)" title="wikilink">miners' strike</a> was the climax of the confrontation between the unions and the Thatcher government. In March 1984 the NUM ordered a strike, without a national ballot,<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> in opposition to <a href="National_Coal_Board" title="wikilink">National Coal Board</a> proposals to close 20 pits out of 174 state-owned mines and cut 20,000 jobs out of 187,000.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a><a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a><a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> Two-thirds of the country's miners downed tools.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a><a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> Thatcher refused to meet the union's demands,<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> and said: &quot;We had to fight the enemy without in the Falklands. We always have to be aware of the enemy within, which is much more difficult to fight and more dangerous to liberty.&quot;<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a></p>
<p>Violence was common on the picket lines during the miners' strike; controversial police tactics were used against strikers.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> The strike resulted in at least three deaths.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> Two miners, Joe Green and David Jones, were crushed to death by lorries while picketing.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a><a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> Two miners, Dean Hancock and Russell Shankland, were sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for the <a href="Killing_of_David_Wilkie" title="wikilink">manslaughter of taxi driver David Wilkie</a> who was taking a working miner to his colliery.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> Some 20,000 people were injured in the course of the strike.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> 11,300 miners and their supporters were arrested and charged with criminal offences.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a><a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
<p>The NUM's failure to ballot and the picket line violence and intimidation cost the strike public support. A MORI poll in June 1984 found that 41% of people backed the Coal Board, and 35% the miners. By August support for the Board had risen to 46%, while support for the miners had fallen to 30%. The position remained unchanged at the end of the year. The miners' strike also split the trade union movement, with lorry drivers, dockers and power station employees crossing picket lines or handling coal.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> The strike was described as &quot;one of the most aggressive trade union struggles since the <a href="1926_General_Strike" title="wikilink">1926 General Strike</a>&quot;,<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> with some commentators even suggesting it was &quot;the nearest the country had come to civil war for 400 years&quot;.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> <a href="Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> <a href="Robert_Runcie" title="wikilink">Robert Runcie</a> accused Thatcher personally of fostering a &quot;politics of confrontation&quot;, and blamed her policies for high unemployment, which he said had created &quot;despair about the future&quot;.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>
<p>After a year out on strike, in March 1985, the NUM leadership conceded without a deal. The cost of the strike to the economy was estimated at least &lt;U+00A3&gt;1.5 billion. The strike was also blamed for much of the pound's fall against the US dollar.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> The government proceeded to close 25 unprofitable pits in 1985; by 1992, a total of 97 pits had been closed,<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> with the remaining being sold off and privatised in 1994.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> These actions had great effect on the industrial and political complexion of the country.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> The eventual closure of 150 collieries, not all of which were losing money, resulted in a loss of tens of thousands of jobs and devastated entire communities,<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a><a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> delivering a blow from which the coal industry, with 50 mines employing 6,000 people, has barely begun to recover, with plans for 58 new open-cast mines and up to a dozen new deep mines.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a></p>

<p>On the early morning of 12 October 1984, the day before her 59th birthday, Thatcher narrowly escaped injury in the <a href="Brighton_hotel_bombing" title="wikilink">Brighton hotel bombing</a> carried out by the <a href="Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army" title="wikilink">Provisional Irish Republican Army</a>.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> Five people were killed in the attack, including the wife of Cabinet Minister <a href="John_Wakeham" title="wikilink">John Wakeham</a>; a prominent member of the Cabinet, <a href="Norman_Tebbit" title="wikilink">Norman Tebbit</a>, was injured, and his wife Margaret was left paralysed.

<h4 id="cold-war">Cold War</h4>

<p>Thatcher took office in the final decade of the <a href="Cold_War" title="wikilink">Cold War</a>, a period of strategic confrontation between the <a href="Western_world#The_Cold_War" title="wikilink">Western powers</a> and the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> and its <a href="Warsaw_Pact" title="wikilink">Warsaw Pactsatellites</a>. During her first year as prime minister she supported <a href="NATO" class="uri" title="wikilink">NATO</a>'s decision to deploy U.S. <a href="Cruise_missile" title="wikilink">Cruise missiles</a> and <a href="Pershing_missile" title="wikilink">Pershing missiles</a> in Western Europe.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> She permitted the United States to station more than 160 nuclear cruise missiles at <a href="Greenham_Common" title="wikilink">Greenham Common</a>, arousing mass protests by the <a href="Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament" title="wikilink">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a>.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a></p>
<p>Thatcher became closely aligned with the policies of U.S. President <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Ronald Reagan</a> (1981&lt;U+2013&gt;1989), and their closeness produced transatlantic cooperation.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> His policy of <a href="Deterrence_theory" title="wikilink">deterrence</a> against the Soviets contrasted with the policy of <em><a href="d&lt;U+00E9&gt;tente" class="uri" title="wikilink">d&lt;U+00E9&gt;tente</a></em> which the West had pursued during the 1970s, and caused friction with allies who still adhered to the idea of <em>d&lt;U+00E9&gt;tente</em>.</p>
<p>Thatcher was among the first Western leaders to respond warmly to reformist Soviet leader <a href="Mikhail_Gorbachev" title="wikilink">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>. They met in London in 1984, three months before he became General Secretary. Thatcher declared that she liked him, and told Reagan, saying, &quot;we can do business together&quot;.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> Following the Reagan-Gorbachev summit meetings from 1985 to 1988, as well as multiple reforms enacted by Gorbachev in the USSR, Thatcher declared in November 1988, &quot;We're not in a Cold War now&quot; but rather in a &quot;new relationship much wider than the Cold War ever was.&quot;<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> She continued, &quot;I expect Mr Gorbachev to do everything he can to continue his reforms. We will support it.&quot;<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a></p>
<p>Thatcher initially opposed <a href="German_reunification" title="wikilink">German reunification</a>, telling Premier Gorbachev that &lt;U+201C&gt;this would lead to a change to postwar borders, and we cannot allow that because such a development would undermine the stability of the whole international situation and could endanger our security.&lt;U+201D&gt; She expressed concern that a united Germany would align itself closer with the Soviet Union and move away from NATO.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> Recent records attribute Gorbachev as stating that &quot;the West doesn&lt;U+2019&gt;t want German reunification but wants to use us to prevent it&quot;, possibly because of the line taken by Thatcher and other European leaders such as France's Mr Mitterrand who was even thinking of a military alliance with Russia to stop it, &lt;U+201C&gt;camouflaged as a joint use of armies to fight natural disasters&lt;U+201D&gt;.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>
<p>Thatcher's premiership outlasted the Cold War, which ended in 1989, and those who share her views on it credit her with a part in the West's victory, by both the deterrence and <em>d&lt;U+00E9&gt;tente</em> postures.</p>
<h4 id="nuclear-deterrent">Nuclear deterrent</h4>
<p>In March 1982 Thatcher approved the modernisation of the <a href="Nuclear_weapons_and_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">strategic nuclear force</a> by ordering a new generation of <a href="UGM-133_Trident_II" title="wikilink">Trident</a> <a href="Vanguard_class_submarine" title="wikilink">submarines</a> to replace <a href="UGM-27_Polaris#British_Polaris" title="wikilink">Polaris</a><a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> at a cost of &lt;U+00A3&gt;10 billion,<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> creating 25,000 British jobs.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> She justified the expenditure on the basis that the United Kingdom was acquiring only the minimum deterrent against Soviet aggression and rejected participation in <a href="START_I" title="wikilink">START negotiations</a> unless the U.S. and Soviet arsenals were substantially reduced.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> She committed the government to using savings from co-operation with the United States in the nuclear field to strengthen British conventional forces.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a></p>

<p>In April 1986 Thatcher, after expressing initial reservations, permitted U.S. F-111s to use RAF bases for the <a href="bombing_of_Libya" title="wikilink">bombing of Libya</a> in retaliation for the alleged <a href="1986_Berlin_discotheque_bombing" title="wikilink">Libyan bombing of a Berlin discoth&lt;U+00E8&gt;que</a>,<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> citing the right of self-defence under <a href="Article_51" title="wikilink">Article 51</a> of the <a href="UN_Charter" title="wikilink">UN Charter</a>.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="supplementary-extradition-treaty">Supplementary Extradition Treaty</h4>
<p>Thatcher also contended that her support for the U.S. bombing of Libya imposed an obligation on the United States to ratify a new extradition treaty with the United Kingdom in order to stand up to <a href="Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army" title="wikilink">IRA</a> violence. &quot;What is the point,&quot; she asked, &quot;of the United States taking a foremost part against terrorism and then not being as strict as they can against Irish terrorism, which afflicts one of their allies?&quot;<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> The U.S.-U.K. Supplementary Extradition Treaty, restricting the application of the political offence exception, signed in June 1986, and coming into force in December, was &quot;hailed as a major improvement in the efforts of democratic nations to fight international terrorism&quot;.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="westland-affair">Westland affair</h4>
<p>Thatcher's preference for defence ties with the United States was also demonstrated in the <a href="Westland_affair" title="wikilink">Westland affair</a> of 1986 when she acted with colleagues to allow the helicopter manufacturer <a href="Westland_Aircraft" title="wikilink">Westland</a>, a vital defence contractor, to refuse to link with the Italian firm <a href="Agusta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Agusta</a> in order for it to link with the management's preferred option, <a href="Sikorsky_Aircraft_Corporation" title="wikilink">Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation</a> of the United States.

<p>A sceptical British public was disenchanted with Thatcher's system of local taxation<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a> and it was to be among the most unpopular policies of her premiership. What the Thatcher government did not anticipate was that local councils would raise their total shares from the taxes.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a> As a result, the central Government capped rates that seemed out of line, resulting in charges of partisanship and the alienation of small-government Conservatives.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> The Prime Minister's popularity declined in 1989 as she continued to refuse to compromise on the tax.<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a> Unrest mounted and culminated in a number of <a href="Poll_Tax_Riots" title="wikilink">riots</a>, the most serious of which occurred at <a href="Trafalgar_Square" title="wikilink">Trafalgar Square</a>, London, on 31 March 1990; more than 100,000 protesters attended and more than 400 people were arrested.<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a></p>
<p>A BBC Radio poll in September 1989 indicated that almost three-quarters of the public were also against water privatisation.<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a> Despite public opposition to the poll tax and the privatisation of water, electricity, and <a href="British_Rail" title="wikilink">British Rail</a>, Thatcher remained confident that, as with her other major reforms, the initial public opposition would turn into support after implementation. A <a href="Ipsos_MORI" title="wikilink">MORI</a> poll for the <em><a href="Sunday_Times" title="wikilink">Sunday Times</a></em> in June 1988 found that more than 60% of voters agreed that in the long term the Thatcher government's policies would improve the state of the economy, while less than 30% disagreed; although income inequality had increased the poor were still better off than in 1979: 74% of Britons said they were satisfied with their present standard of living, while only 18% were dissatisfied.<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a></p>

<p>At Bruges, Belgium, in 1988, Thatcher made a speech in which she outlined her opposition to proposals from the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Community</a>, a forerunner to the European Union, for a federal structure and increasing centralisation of decision-making.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> Though she had supported British membership in the EC, Thatcher believed that the role of the organisation should be limited to ensuring free trade and effective competition, and feared that the EC approach to governing was at odds with her views of smaller government and deregulatory trends;<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a> in 1988, she remarked, &quot;We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels&quot;.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> A split was emerging over European policy inside the British Government and her Conservative Party.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a></p>
<p>On 30 November 1988, when the <a href="European_Court_of_Human_Rights" title="wikilink">European Court of Human Rights</a> ruled that Britain's detention provisions were in breach of European law, the policy split extended to parliament with the presentation of a petition calling for a written British constitution. Thatcher reacted angrily to the ECHR ruling, and to the failure of Belgium and Ireland to extradite a suspected terrorist, <a href="Father_Patrick_Ryan" title="wikilink">Father Patrick Ryan</a>, to face charges in Britain. She told the Commons: &quot;We shall consider the judgment carefully and also the human rights of the victims and potential victims of terrorism.&quot;<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a></p>

<p>Thatcher was visiting the United States when she received word that Iraqi leader <a href="Saddam_Hussein" title="wikilink">Saddam Hussein</a> had invaded neighbouring Kuwait.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a> She met with US President <a href="George_H._W._Bush" title="wikilink">George H.

<h4 id="resignation">Resignation</h4>

<p>Despite having the longest continuous period of office of any prime minister in the twentieth century, Thatcher had, on average during her premiership, the second-lowest approval rating of any post-war prime minister, at 40%, only beating <a href="Edward_Heath" title="wikilink">Edward Heath</a>; even after the Falklands War it had never risen above 55%; polls consistently showed that she was less popular than the Conservative party.<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a> A self-described conviction politician, Thatcher always insisted she did not care about her poll ratings, pointing instead to her unbeaten election record.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a></p>
<p>Moreover, in relative terms, Thatcher's personal position had remained consistently strong: a Marplan poll for the <em><a href="Sunday_Express" title="wikilink">Sunday Express</a></em> in October 1988 showed that Thatcher was still trusted by 61% of Britons to lead the country, compared with only 17% for Labour leader <a href="Neil_Kinnock" title="wikilink">Neil Kinnock</a>. Thatcher's capacity to lead was trusted by 87% of Conservative voters and 46% of Labour voters.<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a> A Telephone Surveys poll for the <em>Sunday Express</em> in September 1990, during the Gulf crisis, found that 65% of voters preferred Thatcher as a crisis leader to Kinnock, who polled 20%.<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a></p>
<p>A <a href="Ipsos_MORI" title="wikilink">Mori</a> poll for the <em><a href="Sunday_Times" title="wikilink">Sunday Times</a></em> in September 1989 showed that Thatcher was still the public's preferred choice of Conservative leader, attracting the support of 32% of voters, her pro-European former cabinet colleague <a href="Michael_Heseltine" title="wikilink">Michael Heseltine</a> coming second on 22%.<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a> However, by March 1990, in the face of rising inflation and the threat of a <a href="Early_1990s_recession" title="wikilink">recession</a> and inevitable mass unemployment, Thatcher's support had halved to 15%, with Heseltine's doubling to 40%.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a> Opposition to the poll tax<a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260"><sup>260</sup></a> and the divisions opening in the parliamentary party over <a href="European_integration" title="wikilink">European integration</a><a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a> left Thatcher increasingly vulnerable to a challenge.<a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262"><sup>262</sup></a></p>
<p>By November 1990 the Conservatives had been trailing Labour for 18 months.<a href="#fn263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263"><sup>263</sup></a> Although a Mori survey for the <em>Sunday Times</em> showed that 83% of Conservative voters were satisfied by the way Thatcher represented the United Kingdom in Europe,<a href="#fn264" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref264"><sup>264</sup></a> a BBC poll found that Labour had increased its lead by 5 points to 14%, its biggest lead since May, while a poll for the <a href="Evening_Standard" title="wikilink">Evening Standard</a> found that Labour had nearly doubled its lead over the Conservatives to 13.2 points.<a href="#fn265" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref265"><sup>265</sup></a> Low poll ratings, along with Thatcher's combative personality and willingness to override colleagues' opinions, contributed to discontent in the parliamentary party.<a href="#fn266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266"><sup>266</sup></a></p>
<p>On 1 November 1990, Geoffrey Howe, for 15 years one of Thatcher's most &quot;loyal and self-effacing&quot; supporters, resigned from his position as Deputy Prime Minister over her refusal to agree to a timetable for British membership of the single currency.<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267"><sup>267</sup></a><a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268"><sup>268</sup></a> In his resignation speech in the Commons on 13 November, referring to Thatcher's promise to veto any arrangement which jeopardised the pound sterling, Howe famously complained: &quot;It is rather like sending your opening batsmen to the crease only for them to find the moment that the first balls are bowled that their bats have been broken before the game by the team captain.&quot;<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269"><sup>269</sup></a> Howe's resignation put Thatcher's future in doubt,<a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a><a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271"><sup>271</sup></a> and was afterwards recognised as dealing a &quot;fatal blow&quot; to her premiership.<a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272"><sup>272</sup></a> While 59% of the British public polled for <em><a href="The_Independent" title="wikilink">The Independent</a></em> by Number Market Research agreed with Thatcher's opposition to monetary union, 64% still felt she ought to retire.<a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273"><sup>273</sup></a></p>

Five separate polls indicated that he would give the Conservatives a national lead over Labour.<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a> Heseltine attracted sufficient support from the parliamentary party in the first round of voting to prolong the contest to a second ballot.<a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275"><sup>275</sup></a> Although Thatcher initially stated that she intended to contest the second ballot,<a href="#fn276" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref276"><sup>276</sup></a> she consulted with her Cabinet and decided to withdraw from the contest.<a href="#fn277" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref277"><sup>277</sup></a> Thatcher said that pressure from her colleagues helped her to conclude that the unity of the Conservative Party and the prospect of victory in the next general election would be more likely if she resigned.<a href="#fn278" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref278"><sup>278</sup></a> Early on the morning of 22 November, the 65-year-old Prime Minister announced to the Cabinet that she would not be a candidate in the second ballot.<a href="#fn279" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref279"><sup>279</sup></a> Thatcher informed the Queen of her decision, and a statement was released from 10 Downing Street at 09.34:<a href="#fn280" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref280"><sup>280</sup></a></p>

<p>Thatcher remains identified with her remarks to the reporter Douglas Keay, for <em><a href="Woman&#39;s_Own" title="wikilink">Woman's Own</a></em> magazine, 23 September 1987:</p>

<p>As the individualistic credo expressed above took hold of Thatcher's Britain, egalitarian concerns dwindled. &quot; Authorities on poverty rates and income distributions differ as to precisely when the optimum moment of equality in Britain came, but some statistics leap out. The <a href="Gini_coefficient" title="wikilink">Gini coefficient</a>, a common measure of income inequality, reached its lowest level for British households in 1977. The proportion of individual Britons below the poverty line did the same in 1978. Social mobility, the likelihood of someone becoming part of a different class from their parents, peaked in the <a href="James_Callaghan" title="wikilink">Callaghan</a> era. The egalitarian Britain of the Callaghan years and its social trends were relentlessly reversed in the Thatcher years and beyond, so that Britain in the 1970s was probably more equal than it had ever been before, and certainly more than it has ever been since&quot; <a href="#fn338" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref338"><sup>338</sup></a> Thatcher. To her supporters Margaret Thatcher remains a figure who revitalised Britain's economy, impacted the trade unions, and re-established the nation as a world power.<a href="#fn339" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref339"><sup>339</sup></a> Yet Thatcher was also a controversial figure, her premiership marked by high unemployment and social unrest,<a href="#fn340" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref340"><sup>340</sup></a> and many critics fault her economic policies for the unemployment level.<a href="#fn341" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref341"><sup>341</sup></a> Speaking in <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a> in April 2009, before the 30th anniversary of her election as prime minister, Thatcher declared: &quot;I regret nothing,&quot; and insisted she &quot;was right to introduce the <a href="Community_Charge" title="wikilink">poll tax</a> and to close loss-making industries to end the country's 'dependency culture'.&quot;<a href="#fn342" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref342"><sup>342</sup></a> Critics have regretted her influence in the abandonment of full employment, poverty reduction and a consensual civility as bedrock policy objectives. The tone of many recent biographers has been 'that of a policeman examining a nasty crime scene' and <a href="Michael_White_(journalist)" title="wikilink">Michael White</a> writing in <em><a href="The_New_Statesman" title="wikilink">The New Statesman</a></em> in February 2009 wondered if the ' hubristic collapse of the free-market model of capitalism that she promoted [had] dealt her another blow.

<p>The <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour party</a>, in adapting its <a href="social_democratic" title="wikilink">social democratic</a> agenda, incorporated much of the economic, social and political tenets of Thatcherism.<a href="#fn344" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref344"><sup>344</sup></a> Thatcher's programme of <a href="privatization" title="wikilink">privatising</a> <a href="nationalisation" title="wikilink">state-owned enterprises</a> has not been reversed.<a href="#fn345" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref345"><sup>345</sup></a> Indeed, successive Conservative and Labour governments have further curtailed direct state management of the economy and have further dismantled public ownership.<a href="#fn346" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref346"><sup>346</sup></a> Yet Thatcher's growth model, as it promoted privatisation of public assets and deregulation of the private sector, particularly the financial sector, its encouragement of the financial sector to 'create new ways of spreading risk and expanding credit' has, since 2008, looked less definitive. The financial revolution in London in the 1980s meant that among the large economies none rivalled Britain for the relative size of its financial sector. Whether the events of 2008-2009, &quot;the collapse of a particular growth model and ideology, the discrediting of many of the prescriptions of <a href="neo-liberalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">neo-liberalism</a>, <em>and the dramatic return of the state</em>, in the form of bank bailouts and nationalizations - constitute a permanent and major political and ideological shift, or whether the changes will only prove to be temporary&quot; - is still to be seen.<a href="#fn347" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref347"><sup>347</sup></a> In his 2009 TV series 'Off Kilter', looking at Scotland, the cultural commentator <a href="Jonathan_Meades" title="wikilink">Jonathan Meades</a> spoke of Thatchers legacy in Fife: &quot;Fife's mining towns and villages were victims, collateral as they say, of that bloody spat of 25 years ago; - mining <em>might</em>, just <em>might</em>, have been economically exhausted, but it was socially cohesive; it's undeniable that jobs do foment pride, they inculcate an idea of self worth. Finchley was quite incapable of empathy. There is much to be said in favour of inefficient industry, not least that that the human cost of efficiency and adherence to the bottom line does not have to be paid, - nor for that matter does unemployment benefit have to be paid to the tens of thousands rationalised into involuntary idleness. Further, the Finchley faith, which became the enthusiastically adopted cross-party consensus of the past 25 years, the <em>faith</em> that manufacturing industry was an irrelevance, and that an entire economy, a souffl&lt;U+00E9&gt; economy, might be founded on the no-holds-barred selflessness of deregulated debt rights, peddling expensive money, proved to be just that, a <em>faith</em>, an expression of unfounded wishfulness.&quot; <a href="#fn348" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref348"><sup>348</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn5">Maurice Crittenden, a British journalist, in <em>The Sunday Times</em>, Oct. 24, 1998, stated that one of Lady Thatcher's political allies, Labour politician <a href="Woodrow_Wyatt" title="wikilink">Woodrow Wyatt</a>, believed Beatrice Stephenson was the illegitimate daughter of society figure <a href="Harry_Cust" title="wikilink">Harry Cust</a> and his married servant Phoebe Stephenson (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Crust, Mrs Daniel Stephenson). One of Cust's known illegitimate children was <a href="Lady_Diana_Cooper" title="wikilink">Lady Diana Cooper</a>, who knew of the rumor and reportedly found it amusing to refer to Prime Minister Thatcher as her niece (John Campbell, <em>Margaret Thatcher</em>, Jonathan Cape, 2000, Volume I, page 5). The Cust-Roberts story was restated by Crittenden in an article published in 2006 and accessible at the website of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, <a href="http://www.margaretthatcher.org/commentary/displaydocument.asp?docid=110880" class="uri">http://www.margaretthatcher.org/commentary/displaydocument.asp?docid=110880</a><a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
