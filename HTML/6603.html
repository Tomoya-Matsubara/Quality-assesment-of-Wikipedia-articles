The train featured extensive use of <a href="stainless_steel" title="wikilink">stainless steel</a>, was originally named the <em>Zephyr</em>, and was meant as a promotional tool to advertise passenger rail service in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. The construction included innovations such as <a href="shotwelding" class="uri" title="wikilink">shotwelding</a> (a specialized type of <a href="spot_welding" title="wikilink">spot welding</a>) to join the stainless steel, and articulation to reduce its weight.</p>
<p>On <a href="May_26" title="wikilink">May 26</a> <a href="1934" class="uri" title="wikilink">1934</a> it set a <a href="Land_speed_record_for_railed_vehicles" title="wikilink">speed record</a> for travel between <a href="Denver,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Denver, Colorado</a>, and <a href="Chicago,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Chicago, Illinois</a>, when it made a 1,015-<a href="mile" class="uri" title="wikilink">mile</a> (1,633 <a href="kilometre" title="wikilink">km</a>) non-stop &quot;Dawn-to-Dusk&quot; dash in 13 hours 5 minutes at an average speed of 77 <a href="miles_per_hour" title="wikilink">mph</a> (124 <a href="kilometres_per_hour" title="wikilink">km/h</a>). For one section of the run it reached a speed of 112.5 mph (181 km/h), just short of the then US land speed record of 115 mph (185 km/h). The historic dash inspired two films and the train's nickname, &quot;<a href="Silver_Streak" title="wikilink">Silver Streak</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The train entered regular revenue service on <a href="November_11" title="wikilink">November 11</a> <a href="1934" class="uri" title="wikilink">1934</a> between <a href="Kansas_City,_Missouri" title="wikilink">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, <a href="Omaha,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Omaha</a> and <a href="Lincoln,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Lincoln, Nebraska</a>. It operated this and other routes until its retirement in 1960, when it was donated to Chicago's <a href="Museum_of_Science_and_Industry_(Chicago)" title="wikilink">Museum of Science and Industry</a>, where it remains on public display. The train is generally regarded as the first successful <a href="streamliner" class="uri" title="wikilink">streamliner</a> on American railroads.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="concept-and-construction">Concept and construction</h2>
<p>In the early 1930s, the U.S. was in the depths of the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a>. Without the money to purchase new goods, freight trains were not hauling as much as they had in the previous decade. People who could not buy goods also could not afford to travel to the extent that they had before, so passenger revenues were also down. Even if they did have the money to travel, the <a href="passenger_car" title="wikilink">equipment</a> that railroads were using to carry passengers had not changed much since the middle of the 19th century. Railroads needed a way to re-energize the traveling public and offer a bit of hope for the days to come.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Pioneer_Zephyr,_engine.jpg" title="fig:The engine in the Pioneer Zephyr" alt="The engine in the Pioneer Zephyr" width="200" /> One of the railroad presidents who faced this challenge was <a href="Ralph_Budd" title="wikilink">Ralph Budd</a>, formerly of the <a href="Great_Northern_Railway_(US)" title="wikilink">Great Northern Railway</a> and now president of the <a href="Chicago,_Burlington_and_Quincy_Railroad" title="wikilink">Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad</a> (Burlington), who needed a new train to get the public interested in traveling again. Naming the train was task that was very seriously taken by Budd. He wanted a name that started with the letter <em>Z</em> because this train was intended to be the &quot;last word&quot; in passenger service; Budd and his coworkers looked up the last words in their dictionaries, but neither <em>zymurgy</em> nor <em>zyzzle</em> conveyed the meanings that Budd was looking for. The name of the new train came from <em><a href="The_Canterbury_Tales" title="wikilink">The Canterbury Tales</a></em>, which Budd had been reading. The story begins with pilgrims setting out on a journey, inspired by the budding springtime and by <a href="Zephyrus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zephyrus</a>, the gentle and nurturing west wind. Budd thought that would be an excellent name for a sleek new traveling machine&lt;U+2014&gt;<em>Zephyr</em>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1932 Ralph Budd met <a href="Edward_G._Budd" title="wikilink">Edward G. Budd</a> (no relation), an automotive steel pioneer who was founder and president of the <a href="Budd_Company" title="wikilink">Budd Company</a>. Edward Budd was demonstrating his new carbody construction in a prototype rail motorcar built of <a href="stainless_steel" title="wikilink">stainless steel</a>. Stainless steel provided many benefits over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; it was a lighter and stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to <a href="corrosion" class="uri" title="wikilink">corrosion</a> meant that it would not have to be painted to protect it from the weather. Since the carbody was much lighter than similar cars, it would be able to carry a higher revenue load for the same cost.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The problem with building stainless steel cars was that nobody could find an adequate way to hold the body together, until the Budd Company patented the <a href="shotwelding" class="uri" title="wikilink">shotwelding</a> technique. On <a href="August_20" title="wikilink">August 20</a> <a href="1932" class="uri" title="wikilink">1932</a>, <a href="Earl_J._Ragsdale" title="wikilink">Earl J. Ragsdale</a>, an engineer at the Budd Company, filed for a patent on &quot;Method and product of electric welding&quot;; on <a href="January_16" title="wikilink">January 16</a> <a href="1934" class="uri" title="wikilink">1934</a>, the <a href="United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office" title="wikilink">United States Patent and Trademark Office</a> granted  to the Budd Company to cover the technique.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Basically, because of the nature of stainless steel, traditional <a href="welding" class="uri" title="wikilink">welding</a> methods would unacceptably weaken the metal at the joint. In a shotweld, the two pieces of metal that are to be joined are pressed together at the joint with an <a href="electrode" class="uri" title="wikilink">electrode</a> on each side of the joint. A very high electric current is passed through the joint, which fuses the two pieces of metal together.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Pioneer_Zephyr,_driver&#39;s_controls.jpg" title="fig:The driver&#39;s controls for the Pioneer Zephyr." alt="The driver&#39;s controls for the Pioneer Zephyr." width="200" /> Another factor in making the <em>Zephyr</em> lighter than conventional trains was that the individual carbodies in the train share their <a href="bogie" title="wikilink">trucks</a> with adjacent cars.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In this design by Budd engineer <a href="Walter_B._Dean" title="wikilink">Walter B. Dean</a>, the train was three articulated compartments. On conventional passenger cars, each carbody rode upon a pair of trucks (wheel/axle assembly), with one truck at each end. The articulation not only reduced the number of trucks under the train, but it also dispensed with the need for <a href="coupling_(railway)" title="wikilink">couplers</a> between each of the carbodies, further reducing the train's weight.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The exterior design of the train was left to <a href="aeronautics" title="wikilink">aeronautical</a> engineer <a href="Albert_Gardner_Dean" title="wikilink">Albert Gardner Dean</a> (Walter Dean's younger brother) who designed the sloping nose shape, with <a href="architect" class="uri" title="wikilink">architect</a> <a href="John_Harbeson" title="wikilink">John Harbeson</a> and <a href="industrial_designer" title="wikilink">industrial designer</a> <a href="Paul_Philippe_Cret" title="wikilink">Paul Philippe Cret</a> devising a way to strengthen and beautify the sides with the train's horizontal fluting.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> On <a href="April_15" title="wikilink">April 15</a> <a href="1936" class="uri" title="wikilink">1936</a>, Col. Ragsdale, Walter Dean and Albert Dean, filed for patents on &quot;Rail Car Front End Construction.&quot; The United States Patent and Trademark Office assigned  and  to the Budd Company to cover the technique.</p>
<p>The first <em>Zephyr</em> was completed by Budd Company on <a href="April_9" title="wikilink">April 9</a>, <a href="1934" class="uri" title="wikilink">1934</a>, powered by an 8-cylinder, 600-<a href="horsepower" class="uri" title="wikilink">horsepower</a> (447 kW), 8-201-A model <a href="Winton_Motor_Company" title="wikilink">Winton Motor Company</a> engine. Like the diesel-electric locomotives that soon displaced the <a href="steam_locomotive" title="wikilink">steam locomotive</a> on American railroads, this engine powered an electrical generator; the electricity it generated was then fed to electric <a href="traction_motor" title="wikilink">traction motors</a> connected to the axles in the train's front truck.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Pioneer_Zephyr,_RPO_section.jpg" title="fig:The RPO section of the Pioneer Zephyr" alt="The RPO section of the Pioneer Zephyr" width="200" /> The train's engineer sat in a small compartment in the nose of the train, directly in front of the <a href="prime_mover" title="wikilink">prime mover</a>. Behind the engine in the first carbody was a  long <a href="railway_post_office" title="wikilink">railway post office</a> section. The second carbody consisted of a small baggage section and a short buffet and 20-passenger <a href="Coach_(rail)" title="wikilink">coach</a> section. The third and final carbody in the train, as originally built, was configured as half coach (40-passenger seats) and half <a href="observation_car" title="wikilink">observation car</a> (12 passenger seats). As built, the train had 72 seats and could carry 50,000 <a href="pound_(mass)" title="wikilink">pounds</a> (22.7 <a href="tonne" title="wikilink">tonnes</a>) of baggage and express freight. This train's official christening occurred on <a href="April_18" title="wikilink">April 18</a> <a href="1934" class="uri" title="wikilink">1934</a>, at the <a href="Pennsylvania_Railroad" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Railroad</a>'s <a href="Broad_Street_Station_(Philadelphia)" title="wikilink">Broad Street Station</a> in <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The Budd Company used the experience learned in building the <em>Zephyr</em> to build similar trains (such as the <em><a href="Flying_Yankee" title="wikilink">Flying Yankee</a></em>) for other railroads, as well as a number of other <em>Zephyr</em>s for the Burlington.</p>
<h2 id="promotion-dawn-to-dusk-dash">Promotion: &quot;Dawn-to-Dusk&quot; dash</h2>
<p>To catch the public's attention, this train was not simply rolled out of the factory for some dignitary to smash a bottle of <a href="Champagne_(beverage)" title="wikilink">champagne</a> on its nose; it made a dash from one end of the CB&amp;Q, in Denver, to the other, in Chicago. The railroad spared no expense in planning the operations. All other trains along the <em>Zephyr</em>'s route were diverted to <a href="rail_siding" title="wikilink">sidings</a> and the <a href="railroad_switch" title="wikilink">turnouts</a> were spiked into the proper alignment for the <em>Zephyr</em>'s run. Track and <a href="maintenance_of_way" title="wikilink">maintenance of way</a> workers checked every single spike and bolt along the train's route to ensure that there would not be any problems, and temporary speed signs were installed along the route to warn the <em>Zephyr</em>'s driver of curves that would be dangerous at high speeds.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> On the day of the dash, every road <a href="grade_crossing" title="wikilink">grade crossing</a> was manned by a flagman to stop automobile traffic ahead of the train and to ensure that the crossing was clear. Stations along the route were protected by local police officers and members of the <a href="American_Legion" title="wikilink">American Legion</a> and the <a href="Boy_Scouts_of_America" title="wikilink">Boy Scouts of America</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The train left Denver at 7:04 <small>AM</small> <a href="Central_Standard_Time_Zone" title="wikilink">Central Daylight Time</a> and arrived in Chicago at 8:09 <small>PM</small>, 13 hours 5 minutes later, at an average speed of 77 mph (124 km/h). For one section of the run, the train reached a speed of 112.5 mph (181 km/h), just short of the then world land speed record of 115 mph (185 km/h). The non-stop 1,015 mile (1,633 km) trip exceeded the railroad's expectations in being 1 hour 55 minutes faster than was scheduled. Reporters along the route told of the &quot;silver streak&quot; that ran by faster than any other train that normally rode American rails at the time. The Burlington's contemporary passenger trains plied the same distance in around 25 hours.</p>

Budd, president <a href="H._L._Hamilton" title="wikilink">H. L. Hamilton</a> of the Winton Motor Company (at that time a part of the new <a href="General_Motors_Electro-Motive_Division" title="wikilink">General Motors Electro-Motive Division</a>), a number of reporters, some Burlington employees, lucky members of the public, and Zeph, a <a href="burro" class="uri" title="wikilink">burro</a> that was contributed by a <a href="Colorado" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colorado</a> newspaper, the <em>Rocky Mountain News</em>, as a mascot for the train.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The newspaper had described Zeph to the railroad as a &quot;Rocky Mountain Canary&quot; so the train's crew had originally planned only enough space for a birdcage; when they found out it wasn't a bird, the railroad hastily built a pen in the baggage section and bought some hay for it. When asked about the burro, Ralph Budd replied &quot;Why not? One more jackass on this trip won't make a difference.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>After the train arrived in Chicago, it traveled a little farther to the 1934 <a href="Century_of_Progress" title="wikilink">Century of Progress</a> fair (noted in some press articles about the dash as the &quot;Chicago World's Fair&quot;) where it was put on public display on opening day.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> After its display on the <em>Wings of a Century</em> stage, the train was taken on a 31-state, 222-city publicity tour. More than 2 million people saw the train before it entered revenue service.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Part of the tour included a test run between Chicago and <a href="Minneapolis-St._Paul" title="wikilink">Minneapolis-St. Paul</a> a full five hours faster than the Burlington's fastest steam-powered train. Due to the <em>Zephyr</em>'s success on this test run, the Burlington immediately ordered two more <em>Zephyr</em> trainsets that would be dubbed the <em>Twin Zephyrs</em>; the new trains debuted in April 1935 on this route.</p>
<h2 id="regular-revenue-service">Regular revenue service</h2>
<p><img src="Pioneer_Zephyr_first_run_and_millionth_mile_covers.jpg" title="fig:Commemorative postal covers that were carried aboard the Pioneer Zephyr for its first revenue run, on November 11 1934, and as it crossed the one million mile mark, on December 29 1939." alt="Commemorative postal covers that were carried aboard the Pioneer Zephyr for its first revenue run, on November 11 1934, and as it crossed the one million mile mark, on December 29 1939." width="200" /> The <em>Zephyr</em>'s power (leading) car was numbered 9900, the baggage-coach <a href="combine_car" title="wikilink">combine car</a> 505, and the coach-observation 570. The train was placed in regular service between <a href="Kansas_City,_Missouri" title="wikilink">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, <a href="Omaha,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Omaha</a> and <a href="Lincoln,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Lincoln, Nebraska</a>, on <a href="November_11" title="wikilink">November 11</a>, <a href="1934" class="uri" title="wikilink">1934</a>, replacing a pair of <a href="steam_locomotive" title="wikilink">steam locomotives</a> and six heavyweight <a href="passenger_car" title="wikilink">passenger cars</a>, weighing up to eight times as much as the <em>Zephyr</em>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> By June 1935, it proved popular enough to add a fourth car, providing additional coach seating. The fourth car was originally a 40-seat coach number 525, but the following June it was switched to <a href="Minneapolis-St._Paul" title="wikilink">Twin Cities</a> service, then back to the <em>Pioneer Zephyr</em> in December.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Car 525 remained on the train until June 1938. Just over five years after it was introduced, the <em>Pioneer Zephyr</em> crossed the one million mile mark in regular service on <a href="December_29" title="wikilink">December 29</a> <a href="1939" class="uri" title="wikilink">1939</a>, near <a href="Council_Bluffs,_Iowa" title="wikilink">Council Bluffs, Iowa</a>.</p>
<p><img src="Zephyr_at_Chicago_Union_Station_LOC_image.jpg" title="fig:Burlington Zephyr passengers arriving at Chicago&#39;s Union station" alt="Burlington Zephyr passengers arriving at Chicago&#39;s Union station" width="275" /> Ralph Budd and the Burlington capitalized on the <em>Zephyr</em>'s success. However, most passenger trains needed larger capacity. Thus, as the Burlington made a transition to larger <a href="diesel_locomotive" title="wikilink">diesel-electric locomotives</a> pulling individual passenger cars, new streamlined cars of standard-size were ordered, which quickly became the standard of many railroads. However, Burlington was determined to be the leader, and ordered its large <a href="EMD_E-unit" title="wikilink">&quot;E&quot; series</a> passenger diesels to also be equipped with matching stainless-steel fluting. Many of the Burlington's long distance <a href="List_of_named_passenger_trains" title="wikilink">named passenger trains</a> began operating under the <em>Zephyr</em> banner, including the <em><a href="Nebraska_Zephyr" title="wikilink">Nebraska Zephyr</a></em>, <em><a href="Twin_Cities_Zephyr" title="wikilink">Twin Cities Zephyr</a></em>, and perhaps the most famous of the namesake, the <em><a href="California_Zephyr" title="wikilink">California Zephyr</a></em>.</p>
<p>On the second anniversary of the train's famous dash, the original <em>Zephyr</em> was rechristened the <em>Pioneer Zephyr</em> to distinguish it as the first of the Burlington's growing <em>Zephyr</em> fleet. In 1938, car 525 was replaced by car number 500, a 40-seat buffet/lounge car, to provide light meals. Car number 505, the baggage-coach <a href="combine_car" title="wikilink">combine</a>, was rebuilt at this time into a full <a href="baggage_car" title="wikilink">baggage car</a>, but it kept its original windows.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

In 1939 it was involved in a head-on collision with a freight train that completely destroyed the cab. The train was rebuilt and re-entered revenue service soon afterward, but the accident strengthened the desire of locomotive designers to move the cab back from the front of the locomotive to above a large nose, as on <a href="EMD_F-unit" title="wikilink">EMD F-unit</a> and <a href="EMD_E-unit" title="wikilink">EMD E-unit</a> locomotives.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Since the <em>Pioneer Zephyr</em> was built of stainless steel, which is not as recyclable as <a href="aluminium" title="wikilink">aluminum</a>, the train was spared from the metal recycling drives of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. By contrast, <a href="Union_Pacific" title="wikilink">Union Pacific</a>'s <a href="M-10000" class="uri" title="wikilink">M-10000</a>, built of aluminum, was scrapped in 1942 for the war effort, among other reasons.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1948 and 1949, the <em>Pioneer Zephyr</em> was temporarily removed from service to participate in the <a href="Chicago_Railroad_Fair" title="wikilink">Chicago Railroad Fair</a>'s &quot;Wheels A-Rolling&quot; pageant. The fair's purpose was to celebrate 100 years of railroad history west of Chicago, and <em>Pioneer Zephyr</em>'s role in the pageant was to highlight the latest strides in railroad technology. It resumed regular passenger operations when the fair ended on <a href="October_2" title="wikilink">October 2</a> <a href="1949" class="uri" title="wikilink">1949</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> By 1955 the <em>Pioneer Zephyr</em>'s route had been updated to run between <a href="Galesburg,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Galesburg, Illinois</a>, and <a href="Saint_Joseph,_Missouri" title="wikilink">Saint Joseph, Missouri</a>; the trainset had been in continual service since 1934, operating over nearly 3 million miles (4.8 million kilometres). The <em>Pioneer Zephyr</em>'s last revenue run was a trip from <a href="Lincoln,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Lincoln, Nebraska</a>, to <a href="Kansas_City,_Missouri" title="wikilink">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, (along the train's regular revenue route) that then continued to <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a> on <a href="March_20" title="wikilink">March 20</a>, <a href="1960" class="uri" title="wikilink">1960</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> When <a href="Amtrak" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amtrak</a> took over passenger rail services in 1971, the legendary <em>Zephyr</em> name was preserved, and the <em>California Zephyr</em> is an Amtrak route in the 21st century.</p>

<p>More than 40 years later, that classic film&lt;U+2014&gt;or at least the name &quot;Silver Streak&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;served as the inspiration for a newer film of the same name. <a href="Silver_Streak_(1976_film)" title="wikilink"><em>Silver Streak</em></a> (<a href="1976_in_film" title="wikilink">1976</a>) starred <a href="Gene_Wilder" title="wikilink">Gene Wilder</a> and <a href="Richard_Pryor" title="wikilink">Richard Pryor</a>; rather than using the <em>Pioneer Zephyr</em>, the combination murder-mystery and comedy was set in the era in which it was filmed, with the train being patterned more after then modern long-distance trains.</p>

<p>On <a href="May_26" title="wikilink">May 26</a> <a href="1960" class="uri" title="wikilink">1960</a>, the 26th anniversary of the &quot;Dawn-to-Dusk&quot; dash, the original <em>Pioneer Zephyr</em> train (car numbers 9900, 505 and 570) was donated to Chicago's <a href="Museum_of_Science_and_Industry_(Chicago)" title="wikilink">Museum of Science and Industry</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Car number 500, which operated with the train from 1938, went along with <em><a href="Mark_Twain_Zephyr" title="wikilink">Mark Twain Zephyr</a></em> trainset 9903 to a party in <a href="Mount_Pleasant,_Iowa" title="wikilink">Mount Pleasant, Iowa</a>, for static display in a town park, but plans for the train's display did not work out; car 500 and the <em>Mark Twain Zephyr</em> are currently stored in Chicago and plans are currently underway to display it in <a href="Fairfield,_Iowa" title="wikilink">Fairfield, Iowa</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>The Chicago museum displayed the <em>Pioneer Zephyr</em> outside the museum, with no protection from the weather, until 1994. At that time, the steam locomotive that shared the display space with the <em>Zephyr</em>, <a href="Atchison,_Topeka_and_Santa_Fe_Railway" title="wikilink">Santa Fe</a> #2903, was donated to the <a href="Illinois_Railway_Museum" title="wikilink">Illinois Railway Museum</a>, while the Chicago museum prepared a new display location for the <em>Zephyr</em>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>The Chicago museum dug a pit in front of the building and built a new display area for the <em>Zephyr</em>, where it could be displayed year-round. In 1998, after the train received a cosmetic restoration by <a href="Northern_Rail_Car" title="wikilink">Northern Rail Car</a>, in <a href="Milwaukee,_Wisconsin" title="wikilink">Milwaukee, Wisconsin</a>, the pit was finally ready to receive the train. The <em>Pioneer Zephyr</em> train is still on display at the museum just outside the main entrance from the underground parking area for the museum, where it is one of the more popular exhibits.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to the <em>Pioneer Zephyr</em>, two other legacies remain. An operable <em><a href="Nebraska_Zephyr" title="wikilink">Nebraska Zephyr</a></em> train was donated to the large Illinois Railway Museum at <a href="Union,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Union</a>, west of Chicago. There, powered by one of the large <a href="EMD_E-unit" title="wikilink">&quot;E&quot; series</a> passenger diesels (an <a href="EMD_E5" title="wikilink">EMD E5</a>) with the distinctive and durable stainless-steel fluting, it is still operated on short runs on the Museum's substantial trackage, providing train enthusiasts and tourists with an experience reminiscent of the heyday of the Burlington's <em>Zephyr</em> service.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Also utilizing the famous name, the <em><a href="Minnesota_Zephyr" title="wikilink">Minnesota Zephyr</a></em> is an elegant dining train located in the historic city of <a href="Stillwater,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Stillwater, Minnesota</a>, although it is not directly associated with the historic Burlington <em>Zephyr</em> fleet.</p>
<p><a href="Dorney_Park_&amp;_Wildwater_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom</a> in <a href="Allentown,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Allentown, Pennsylvania</a> has a miniature replica train ride called <em>Zephyr</em> which was built in 1935 and helped the park survive the Great Depression.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="models-of-the-pioneer-zephyr">Models of the <em>Pioneer Zephyr</em></h2>
<p>Due to the <em>Zephyr</em>'s place in American railroad history, many <a href="Rail_transport_modelling" title="wikilink">model railroaders</a> have built their own versions of the <em>Pioneer Zephyr</em> in miniature. Several model manufacturers are now producing commercial ready-to-run models or kits of the train for modelers to build. This list is sorted by the manufacturer's release date:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="American_Flyer" title="wikilink">American Flyer</a> produced a ready-to-run <em>Pioneer Zephyr</em> model in <a href="S_scale" title="wikilink">S scale</a> (1:64) in 1965.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.finenscale.com/zephyr.html">Fine N-Scale Products</a> released a kit in 1996 in <a href="N_scale" title="wikilink">N scale</a> (1:160) that includes an option for car number 500.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.all-railroads.com/zephyr.html">Con-Cor</a> made a limited-run model available in both HO scale and N scale that were released in 2005.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.riverraisinmodels.com/curproj.html">River Raisin Models</a> released a ready-to-run model in S scale of both the <em>Pioneer Zephyr</em> (in three- and four-car configurations) and the similar <em><a href="Flying_Yankee" title="wikilink">Flying Yankee</a></em>, in 2005.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mth-railking.com/detail.asp?item=20-2543-1">MTH Electric Trains</a> released a limited production ready-to-run model of the three-car <em>Pioneer Zephyr</em> in <a href="O_scale" title="wikilink">O scale</a> (1:48) in 2005</li>
