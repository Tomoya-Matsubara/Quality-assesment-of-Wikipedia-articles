<h3 id="detroit-lions-management">Detroit Lions management</h3>

<p>Millen was the Lions' CEO for seven full seasons, from 2001-07; during that time, the club compiled a record of 31-81 (with at least nine losses each season).

<p>Despite the team's record on the field, Matt Millen was the second-highest paid general manager in the NFL.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> With a draft record that included a number of high first-round draft picks who were considered poor choices (<a href="Charles_Rogers_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Charles Rogers</a>, <a href="Joey_Harrington" title="wikilink">Joey Harrington</a>, and <a href="Mike_Williams_(wide_receiver)" title="wikilink">Mike Williams</a> among them),<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and widespread disappointment among fans, the media, and even some players, Millen received a five-year contract extension from owner <a href="William_Clay_Ford,_Sr." title="wikilink">William Clay Ford, Sr.</a> at the start of the <a href="2005_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2005</a> season.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Following the team's 3–13 performance in 2006, Ford announced that Millen would be retained as General Manager for at least another season, because according to inside sources to the Ford family, they still believed that Millen is the best GM that the Lions ever had.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> On September 24, 2008, Millen was confirmed to no longer hold his positions with the Lions. Whether he was dismissed or resigned was unclear.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> It was later reported by a team official that Millen was actually fired.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
