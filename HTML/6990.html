<p><strong><em>Good Eats</em></strong> is a <a href="television" class="uri" title="wikilink">television</a> <a href="cooking_show" title="wikilink">cooking show</a> created and hosted by <a href="Alton_Brown" title="wikilink">Alton Brown</a> that airs in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a> on <a href="Food_Network" title="wikilink">Food Network</a>. Likened to television science educators <a href="Mr._Wizard" title="wikilink">Mr. Wizard</a> and <a href="Bill_Nye" title="wikilink">Bill Nye</a>, Brown explores the science and technique behind the cooking, the history of different foods, and the advantages of different kinds of cooking equipment. The show tends to focus on familiar dishes that can easily be made at home, and also features segments on choosing the right appliances, and getting the most out of inexpensive, multi-purpose tools. Each episode of <em>Good Eats</em> has a distinct theme, which is typically an ingredient or a certain cooking technique, but may also be a more generic theme such as <a href="Thanksgiving" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thanksgiving</a>, or &quot;man food.&quot; Good Eats received a <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> <a href="Peabody_Award" title="wikilink">Peabody Award</a>.</p>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>The show has a distinctive visual style involving <a href="Dutch_angle" title="wikilink">Dutch angles</a> and shots from cameras placed inside and on various items in the kitchen, including the <a href="oven" title="wikilink">ovens</a>, <a href="refrigerator" class="uri" title="wikilink">refrigerator</a>, and <a href="microwave_oven" title="wikilink">microwave oven</a>. In some episodes, Brown and other actors play various characters to tell the story of the food. For example, in the episode &quot;The Big Chili,&quot; Brown played a <a href="cowboy" class="uri" title="wikilink">cowboy</a> trying to rustle up the ideal pot of <a href="chili_con_carne" title="wikilink">chili</a>. In the episode &quot;Give Peas A Chance&quot; (a parody of <em><a href="The_Exorcist" title="wikilink">The Exorcist</a></em>), Brown plays a Father Merrin-like character who tries to convince a &quot;possessed&quot; child to eat (and like) peas. In other episodes Brown is simply himself, but is surrounded by fictional characters such as his eggplant and tomato wielding neighbor Mr. McGregor, or a <a href="city_council" title="wikilink">city councilman</a> who refuses to eat fudge. He also uses various makeshift teaching aids to demonstrate scientific concepts.</p>
<p>Episodes of <em>Good Eats</em> typically begin with an introductory <a href="monologue" class="uri" title="wikilink">monologue</a> that always either ends with or leads into the phrase &quot;good eats.&quot; The show often closes with the phrase as well. For the first several seasons, Brown himself would say the words &quot;good eats.&quot; More recently, however, Brown avoids saying &quot;good eats&quot; at the end of the intro or outro, stopping just short and letting the theme music fill in the phrase.</p>
<p>Episodes usually take place primarily in the (fictional) kitchen of Brown's house. In Seasons 1&lt;U+2013&gt;4, the episodes were shot in the actual home kitchen of Brown's mother-in-law in the <a href="Atlanta,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Atlanta</a>, <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a> area. In Season 5, taping moved to the new home of the show's Line Producer (Dana Popoff) and Director of Photography (Marion Laney), in which they built a much larger and more versatile kitchen for taping. A 7 ft (2.1 m) section of the island was built for the show and placed on wheels, so it can be moved (or removed) for various shots, and a 12 sq ft (1.1 sq m) grid of pipe was hung from the ceiling, for easier placement of cameras and microphones. The house was featured in a <a href="http://www.homemag.com/article.asp?section_id=25&amp;article_id=50&amp;page_number=1"><em>Home Magazine article</em></a> in February 2003. Starting with Season 7, the show moved yet again, this time to an exact replica of the previous kitchen and surrounding areas of the home, built on a sound stage. In the &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot; special, Brown said that complaints by Popoff's neighbors prompted the move. The stove top and the sink are the only functioning pieces in this kitchen. Many of the other appliances have even had part of their backs removed, so shots of Brown can be taken from inside cabinets, ovens, and refrigerators. This change was generally not known until after Season 7 started airing when the house used in Season 5&lt;U+2013&gt;6 was put on <a href="eBay" class="uri" title="wikilink">eBay</a> for sale. It was then revealed that they had moved. It is generally thought that in the &quot;Q&quot; episode on barbecue that was taped in Brown's <a href="Airstream" class="uri" title="wikilink">Airstream</a> trailer, when Brown says that they are &quot;building the set for Good Eats: The Motion Picture&quot; this is in reality a reference to the new house set. The set was not officially unveiled on the show as a set until the Avocado Experiment show, though the appearance of a trap door in the hardwood floor several episodes previous (&quot;Good Wine Gone Bad&quot;) was highly suggestive of a TV set.</p>
<p><a href="Incidental_music" title="wikilink">Incidental music</a> during the show is typically a <a href="Variation_(music)" title="wikilink">variation</a> of the show's theme, which in turn was based on the theme music from the film <em><a href="Get_Shorty_(film)" title="wikilink">Get Shorty</a></em>. There are dozens of variations of the theme played throughout, crossing all genres of music, including the keypad tones in &quot;Mission:Poachable&quot; and nearly every incidence where a countdown of ten seconds is used. New music is composed for each episode by Patrick Belden of Belden Music and Sound.</p>
<p>Each episode also features text pieces containing <a href="trivia" class="uri" title="wikilink">trivia</a> related to the food or cooking technique featured in the episode. These are always shown just before <a href="advertising" title="wikilink">ad breaks</a>, and are often shown between major transitions in location or cooking action. The information presented is usually notes about the history of the food or technique, helpful cooking hints, or technical or scientific information which would be too detailed or dry to include as part of the show's live content.</p>
<p>During the show's first seasons, at the end of each episode Brown would give a summary of the important points covered during the episode; these points would be shown on the screen as he talked. Brown also traveled to food manufacturing facilities frequently in the first few seasons to talk with experts about the foods being featured.</p>
<h2 id="cast-and-crew">Cast and crew</h2>
<p>A staple feature of <em>Good Eats</em> is the presence of several recurring characters who play important roles on the show, from Brown's relatives and neighbors to various <a href="Wiktionary:nemesis" title="wikilink">nemeses</a>. There is an unofficial rule on the <em>Good Eats</em> set that every crew member must appear in an episode in some fashion, at some point in their time working on the series. Steve Rooney, who was the show's Executive Chef in the first seasons, has had the most varied characters.</p>
<p>A few members of Brown's real-life family have appeared on the show. His mother had a walk-on part; his daughter, Zoey, has appeared in several episodes; and his late<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> grandmother, &quot;Ma&quot; Mae Skelton, co-hosted the <a href="biscuit" class="uri" title="wikilink">biscuit</a> episode, &quot;The Dough Also Rises.&quot; Even his <a href="bassett_hound" title="wikilink">bassett hound</a> and <a href="iguana" class="uri" title="wikilink">iguana</a> have shown up in a couple of episodes. However, his wife DeAnna (who is also the <a href="executive_producer" title="wikilink">executive producer</a> of <em>Good Eats</em>) has never been documented as having appeared on an episode.</p>
<p>Specialists who hold real-life positions commonly appear as themselves to provide Brown with useful information on the topic at hand.</p>

Brown realizes this, and intentionally fools with gadgets and acts silly to get a rise out of her. He also likes to sabotage her attempts to make sales. Even so, she is the most reliable source of equipment for Brown, as she knows everything about kitchen tools and <a href="appliances" class="uri" title="wikilink">appliances</a>. Her appearances are accompanied by a theme that sounds similar to those heard in the James Bond movies. &quot;W&quot;'s full name is revealed in the episode &quot;Salad Daze II: The Long Arm Of the Slaw.&quot; In later episodes, &quot;W&quot; began working in the &quot;Good Eats Testing Lab&quot;.

She often tricks Brown into cooking for her, which usually initiates the topic of that episode. For instance, in &quot;Circle of Life,&quot; Marsha manages to talk Brown into making dozens of doughnuts for her bunny scout troop's <a href="bake_sale" title="wikilink">bake sale</a>, and then tricks him into buying them all back.

Brown treats Elton almost like his own son, despite his and Marsha's constant feuding. Herina, who looks strikingly similar to Brown, also plays a young Brown when necessary, as in the introduction to the roulade-centered episode &quot;Fit to be Tied&quot;, and also appeared in the 1996 movie <em><a href="Nightjohn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nightjohn</a></em> as the character Homer Waller.</p></td>

In &quot;American Pickle,&quot; for example, B.A. compares Brown's sweet pickled fruit to a recipe for extremely hot &quot;Firecracker&quot; carrots. B.A. could either stand for &quot;Bad Alton&quot; or be Brown's initials, reversed, or it could be a reference to <a href="Mr._T" title="wikilink">Mr. T</a>'s character on the television series <em><a href="A-Team" class="uri" title="wikilink">A-Team</a></em> who also had a &quot;Bad Attitude.&quot;</p></td>

Over the course of the series, the Chef seems to become more angry, as his title in different episodes changes to &quot;Really Mad French Chef&quot; and beyond.

<p>Brown also plays other roles from time to time, which usually consist of him explaining something close to the camera while another Brown performs the information that is being presented behind him (similar to the technique used to present B.A. Brown). At the same time, he also acts out alone or with others on camera while providing a narrative quite often (to re-enact such topics as cavemen discovering cooking techniques). There are also scenes where Brown talks to a character played by himself, cutting away to the other after each one has said their line. This is mostly used when the &quot;USDA agents&quot; appear to give grades and regulations placed on meats and dairy products.</p>

<li>Rather than use <a href="cue_cards" title="wikilink">cue cards</a> or a <a href="teleprompter" class="uri" title="wikilink">teleprompter</a>, Brown prerecords his monologue and then uses tiny <a href="earpiece" title="wikilink">earpieces</a> to listen to it as he is on camera. <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> This allows him to keep the complicated facts and statistics in his script straight, and partially accounts for his halting speaking style on the show.</li>
<li>In the episode &quot;Churn Baby Churn 2&quot;, the role of one of the USDA agents was awarded to the winner of Food Network's &quot;<a href="All_Star_Kitchen_Makeover" title="wikilink">All Star Kitchen Makeover</a>&quot; in addition to a kitchen designed by Alton Brown.</li>
<li>The clock seen in <em>Good Eats</em> is often set by the crew to a significant date such as a crew member's birthday, anniversary, etc.</li>
<li>In Season 9, the episode &quot;Behind the Eats&quot; was produced, which offered a backstage look at the show's production.</li>
<li>Whenever Brown mentions <a href="stuffing" class="uri" title="wikilink">stuffing</a>, someone holds up a sign that says &quot;STUFFING IS EVIL.&quot; This is in reference to the Thanksgiving special, wherein Brown denigrated stuffing as increasing cooking time, being a harbinger of <a href="food_poisoning" title="wikilink">food poisoning</a>, and not being good eats. However, he does make exceptions for when stuffing would be appropriate (particularly for stuffed pork), and he later recanted in Season 8 and agreed that stuffing, when done properly, is good eats (dedicating a whole show to the subject).</li>
<li>In episodes with <a href="Bigfoot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bigfoot</a>, the sounds Bigfoot makes are the same noises demons make when dying in the computer game <em><a href="Doom" class="uri" title="wikilink">Doom</a></em>.</li>
<li>According to urban legend, an episode devoted entirely to eating <a href="Cap&#39;n_Crunch" title="wikilink">Cap'n Crunch</a> was filmed as part of an <a href="April_Fools&#39;_Day" title="wikilink">April Fools' Day</a> joke but never aired.</li>
<li>The access codes for the Good Eats <a href="laboratory" class="uri" title="wikilink">laboratory</a> are:</li>
</ul>
<p>:*0851390555 in <em>Mission: Poachable</em> (EA1C13 - Season 3 Episode 11)</p>
<p>:*180*745666 in <em>Chile's Angles</em> (EA1D01 - Season 4 Episode 13)</p>
<ul>
<li>Most Food Network shows do not display name brand names of products used during cooking, and care is taken to create false labels for products in these shows. However, in early seasons of <em>Good Eats</em>, Brown occasionally displayed brand name products on the show (e.g., a bottle of Karo <a href="corn_syrup" title="wikilink">corn syrup</a> during the episode on cooking with sugar). Currently, brand name product labels are altered, although the alterations generally consist of false names added to labels rather than entirely new labels. (i.e. &quot;Kerry&quot; brand Worcestershire sauce) Also, when using crushed crackers in a recipe, Brown will usually say, &quot;What kind? Well, I'm not going to tell you, but they look like this,&quot; and then hold up a <a href="Ritz_cracker" title="wikilink">Ritz cracker</a>. However, on occasional shots taken from inside the freezer, frozen <a href="Publix" class="uri" title="wikilink">Publix</a> brand vegetables can be seen. <a href="Kroger" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kroger</a> stores and products can also be spotted.</li>
<li>In the episode &quot;Pop Art&quot;, the marquee at the Majestic Movie theater advertises &quot;Feasting on Asphalt IV&quot;, one of Alton Brown's other series.</li>
<li>Although it is his most prominent production, Brown says he makes no money from the broadcast of <em>Good Eats</em>. He spends the entire budget allocated by <a href="Food_Network" title="wikilink">Food Network</a> on producing the show and receives no <a href="residual_(entertainment_industry)" title="wikilink">residuals</a>. Instead, all of his personal income comes from DVD sales, book royalties, speaking engagements, and corporate consulting. <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></li>
<li>Brown's real life home kitchen has only been on the show once.</li>
