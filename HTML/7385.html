<p><strong>Mehmet Ali A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca</strong> (; born January 9, 1958) is a Turkish<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="assassination" title="wikilink">assassin</a> who murdered left-wing journalist <a href="Abdi_&lt;U+0130&gt;pek&lt;U+00E7&gt;i" title="wikilink">Abdi &lt;U+0130&gt;pek&lt;U+00E7&gt;i</a> on February 1, 1979 and later shot and wounded <a href="Pope_John_Paul_II" title="wikilink">Pope John Paul II</a> on May 13, 1981, after escaping from a Turkish prison. After serving 19 years of imprisonment in <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, he was deported to <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a>, where he served a ten-year sentence. He was released on January 18, 2010.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca has described himself as a mercenary with no political orientation, although he is known to have been a member of the Turkish ultra-nationalist <a href="Grey_Wolves" title="wikilink">Grey Wolves</a> organization.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>

<p>A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca was born in the <a href="Hekimhan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hekimhan</a> district, <a href="Malatya_Province" title="wikilink">Malatya Province</a> in Turkey. As a youth, he became a petty criminal and a member of street gangs in his home town. He became a smuggler between Turkey and <a href="Bulgaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a>.</p>
<p>He claims to have received two months of training in weaponry and terrorist tactics in <a href="Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syria</a> as a member of the left-wing <a href="Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine" title="wikilink">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine</a> paid for by the Communist <a href="Bulgaria" title="wikilink">Bulgarian</a> government, although this has been questioned.</p>
<h2 id="grey-wolves-involvement">Grey Wolves involvement</h2>
<p>After training he went to work for the far-right Turkish <a href="Grey_Wolves" title="wikilink">Grey Wolves</a>, who were at the time destabilizing Turkey, which led to a <a href="Turkish_military_coup,_1980" title="wikilink">military coup in 1980</a>. It has been claimed ultra-<a href="nationalist" class="uri" title="wikilink">nationalist</a> Grey Wolves were being used by the <a href="CIA" class="uri" title="wikilink">CIA</a>. For instance, according to <a href="Kendal_Nezan" title="wikilink">Kendal Nezan</a> of the <a href="Kurdish_Institute_of_Paris" title="wikilink">Kurdish Institute of Paris</a>, they were infiltrated and manipulated by <a href="Gladio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gladio</a> &quot;<a href="stay-behind" class="uri" title="wikilink">stay-behind</a>&quot; networks, a <a href="NATO" class="uri" title="wikilink">NATO</a> clandestine structure.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>On February 1, 1979 in Istanbul, under orders from the Grey Wolves, he murdered <a href="Abdi_&lt;U+0130&gt;pek&lt;U+00E7&gt;i" title="wikilink">Abdi &lt;U+0130&gt;pek&lt;U+00E7&gt;i</a>, editor of a major Turkish <a href="newspaper" class="uri" title="wikilink">newspaper</a> <em><a href="Milliyet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Milliyet</a></em>. He was caught due to an informant and was sentenced to life in prison. After serving six months, he escaped with the help of <a href="Abdullah_&lt;U+00C7&gt;atl&lt;U+0131&gt;" title="wikilink">Abdullah &lt;U+00C7&gt;atl&lt;U+0131&gt;</a>, second-in-command of the Grey Wolves and a prominent Gladio operative, and fled to Bulgaria, which was a base of operation for the Turkish mafia. According to <a href="investigative_journalist" title="wikilink">investigative journalist</a> <a href="Lucy_Komisar" title="wikilink">Lucy Komisar</a>, Mehmet Ali A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca had worked with Abdullah &lt;U+00C7&gt;atl&lt;U+0131&gt; in this 1979 assassination, who &quot;then reportedly helped organize A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca's escape from an Istanbul military prison, and some have suggested &lt;U+00C7&gt;atl&lt;U+0131&gt; was even involved in the Pope's assassination attempt&quot;. According to <a href="Reuters" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reuters</a>, A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca had &quot;escaped with suspected help from sympathizers in the security services&quot;.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Lucy Komisar added that at the scene of the Mercedes-Benz crash where &lt;U+00C7&gt;atl&lt;U+0131&gt; died, he was found with a passport under the name of &quot;Mehmet &lt;U+00D6&gt;zbay&quot; &lt;U+2014&gt; an alias also used by Mehmet Ali A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="assassination-attempt-on-the-pope">Assassination attempt on the Pope</h2>

<p>Beginning in August 1980 A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca began criss-crossing the Mediterranean region, changing passports and identities, perhaps to hide his trigger point of origin in Sofia, Bulgaria. He entered <a href="Rome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rome</a> on May 10, 1981, coming by train from <a href="Milan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Milan</a>.</p>
<p>According to A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca's later testimony, he met with three accomplices in Rome, one a fellow Turk and the other two Bulgarians. The operation was commanded by Zilo Vassilev, the Bulgarian <a href="military_attach&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">military attach&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> in Italy. He said that he was assigned this mission by Turkish mafioso Bekir Celenk in Bulgaria. <em><a href="Le_Monde_diplomatique" title="wikilink">Le Monde diplomatique</a></em>, however, has alleged that the assassination attempt was organized by <a href="Abdullah_&lt;U+00C7&gt;atl&lt;U+0131&gt;" title="wikilink">Abdullah &lt;U+00C7&gt;atl&lt;U+0131&gt;</a> &quot;in exchange for the sum of 3 million marks&quot;, paid by Bekir Celenk to the Grey Wolves.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>According to A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca, the plan was for him and the back-up gunman Oral &lt;U+00C7&gt;elik to open fire in <a href="St._Peter&#39;s_Square" title="wikilink">St. Peter's Square</a> and escape to the Bulgarian embassy under the cover of the panic generated by a small explosion. On May 13 they sat in the square, writing postcards and waiting for the Pope to arrive. When the Pope passed them, A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca fired several shots and critically wounded him, but was grabbed by spectators and Vatican security chief <a href="Camillo_Cibin" title="wikilink">Camillo Cibin</a> and prevented from finishing the assassination or escaping. Four bullets hit John Paul II, two of them lodging in his lower intestine, the others hitting his left hand and right arm. Two bystanders were also hit. &lt;U+00C7&gt;elik panicked and fled without setting off his bomb or opening fire.</p>
<h2 id="prison-time-release-and-rearrest">Prison time, release, and rearrest</h2>
<p>A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca was sentenced, in July 1981, to <a href="life_imprisonment" title="wikilink">life imprisonment</a> in Italy for the assassination attempt. Following his shooting, Pope John Paul II asked people to &quot;pray for my brother (A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca), whom I have sincerely forgiven.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Although A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca had been quoted as saying that &quot;to me [the Pope] was the incarnation of all that is capitalism&quot;, and had attempted to murder him, A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca developed a friendship with the pontiff. In 1983, he and A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca met and spoke privately at the prison where A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca was being held. The Pope was also in touch with A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca's family over the years, meeting his mother in 1987 and his brother a decade later.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> After serving almost 20 years of a life sentence in prison in Italy, A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca was pardoned by the then Italian president <a href="Carlo_Azeglio_Ciampi" title="wikilink">Carlo Azeglio Ciampi</a> in June 2000 and deported to Turkey.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Following his extradition to Turkey, he was imprisoned for the 1979 murder of <a href="Abdi_&lt;U+0130&gt;pek&lt;U+00E7&gt;i" title="wikilink">Abdi &lt;U+0130&gt;pek&lt;U+00E7&gt;i</a> and for two bank raids carried out in the 1970s. Journalist Abdi &lt;U+0130&gt;pek&lt;U+00E7&gt;i was killed on February 1, 1979. A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca was arrested on June 25 and incarcerated in the Maltepe Military Prison. He fled to Bulgaria on 25 November and was sentenced to death penalty in his absence. A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca was extradited to Turkey in 2000 by benefitting from the Conditional Amnesty Law. This possibility granted to the ex-convict caused strong reactions. Both cases about A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca were merged and tried before the Kad&lt;U+0131&gt;k&lt;U+00F6&gt;y 1st High Criminal Court. The single trial concerned the usurpation of Cengiz Aydos' taxi in 1979, stealing money from the Fruko soda storage on April 4, 1979 and robbing the Y&lt;U+0131&gt;ld&lt;U+0131&gt;rm jewelry store in K&lt;U+0131&gt;z&lt;U+0131&gt;ltoprak on March 22, 1979.</p>
<p>On June 9, 1997, <a href="Air_Malta_Flight_830" title="wikilink">Air Malta Flight 830</a> was <a href="Aircraft_hijacking" title="wikilink">hijacked</a> by two men. After landing in <a href="Cologne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cologne</a>, the hijackers demanded the release of A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca, who at the time was serving a life sentence in Italy for trying to assassinate Pope John Paul II in 1981. A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca was not released and the hijackers surrendered.</p>
<p>On 18 January 2000, the judges decreed for a dismissal of proceedings due to the statute of limitation regarding the case filed for the jewelry store robbery and for &quot;opposition to the Firearms Act&quot; (law no. 6136). For usurpation and money theft A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca was handed a 36 year prison sentence. A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca's lawyers applied for the release of their client deriving benefit from law no. 4516 related to Parole and Postponement of Penalties in December 2000. Their request was rejected by the Kartal 1st High Criminal Court. The lawyers filed an appeal against this decision which was declined again. A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca was sentenced to 10 years in prison for murder.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In early February 2005, during the Pope's illness, A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca sent a letter to the Pope wishing him well and also warning him that the world would end soon. When the Pope died on April 2, 2005, A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca's brother Adnan gave an interview in which he said that Agca and his entire family were grieving, and that the Pope had been a great friend to them. On April 5, 2005 <a href="CNN" class="uri" title="wikilink">CNN</a> stated that A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca would want to visit the Pope's funeral on April 8, 2005. However, <a href="Turkey" title="wikilink">Turkish</a> authorities rejected his request to leave prison to attend.</p>
<p>A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca was released on <a href="parole" class="uri" title="wikilink">parole</a> on January 12, 2006.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Mustafa Demirba&lt;U+011F&gt;, his lawyer, explained his release as a combination of amnesty and penal reform: an amnesty in 2000 deducted 10 years from his time, the court then deducted his 20 years in the Italian prison based on a new article in the penal code, and he was then eligible to be paroled based on good behaviour. However, a report from the French <a href="Agence_France_Presse" title="wikilink">AFP news agency</a> stated that &quot;The Turkish judicial authorities still haven't explained exactly which legal resources he had access to&quot;, and former minister of Justice <a href="Hikmet_Sami_T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk" title="wikilink">Hikmet Sami T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk</a>, in government at the time of A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca's extradition, claimed that, from a legal viewpoint, his liberation was a &quot;serious mistake&quot; at best, and that he should have not been freed before 2012.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> However, on January 20, 2006, the Turkish Supreme Court ruled that his time served in Italy could not be deducted from his Turkish sentence and he was returned to jail.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>It was during his time in prison that he converted to <a href="Christianity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christianity</a> in 2007. He claimed to be the Messiah at his trial and has made many bizarre statements over the years, although it has never been clear whether he is mentally unstable or merely acting.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="on-pope-benedict-xvi">On Pope Benedict XVI</h2>
<p>After <a href="Pope_Benedict_XVI" title="wikilink">Pope Benedict XVI</a> was <a href="Pope_Benedict_XVI_Islam_controversy" title="wikilink">criticized by the Muslim world</a> following the September 12, 2006 <a href="Regensburg_lecture" title="wikilink">Regensburg lecture</a>, Ali A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca wrote a letter to the Pope from jail warning him to cancel his planned trip to <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a> in November 2006. In the letter, which was published in leading Italian Rome-based daily <em><a href="la_Repubblica" title="wikilink">la Repubblica</a></em>,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> he stated:</p>

<p>Despite A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca's warning, Pope Benedict's visit to Turkey proceeded as scheduled without any incidents.</p>
<h2 id="later-developments-and-release">Later developments and release</h2>
<p>On May 2, 2008 A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca asked to be awarded Polish citizenship as he wished to spend the final years of his life in <a href="Poland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poland</a>, Pope John Paul II's country of origin.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca has stated that upon his release he wants to visit Pope John Paul II's tomb and partner with <a href="Dan_Brown" title="wikilink">Dan Brown</a> on writing a book.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>A&lt;U+011F&gt;ca was released from jail on January 18, 2010. He was transferred to a military hospital in order to assess if, at 52, he was still fit for <a href="compulsory_military_service" title="wikilink">compulsory military service</a>. The military found him unfit for military service for having &quot;<a href="antisocial_personality_disorder" title="wikilink">antisocial personality disorder</a>&quot;. In a statement, he announced: &quot;I will meet you in the next three days. In the name of God Almighty, I proclaim the end of the world in this century. All the world will be destroyed, every human being will die. I am not God, I am not son of God, I am Christ eternal.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
