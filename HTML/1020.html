<p>The codex, although displaying <a href="Mixtec_people" title="wikilink">Mixtec</a> stylistic features, is judged to be Maya (if genuine) based upon the use of bark paper instead of the deerhide preferred for Mixtec codices and because of the presence of Maya day signs and numbering.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The codex is poorly preserved; the surviving page fragments display a number of figures in central Mexican style, combined with Maya numbering and day glyphs. The document is currently held by the <a href="Museo_Nacional_de_Antropolog&lt;U+00ED&gt;a" title="wikilink">Museo Nacional de Antropolog&lt;U+00ED&gt;a</a> in Mexico city and is not on public display.

The results were published in 2007 and were mixed; the document apparently contains genuine pre-Columbian materials but certain aspects, such as seemingly artificially induced wear and tear, are suspect. The researchers concluded that they were unable to prove or disprove the pre-Columbian nature of the codex.</p>
<h2 id="physical-characteristics">Physical characteristics</h2>
<p>The <em>Grolier Codex</em> is a screenfold book fashioned from bark paper, coated with <a href="stucco" class="uri" title="wikilink">stucco</a> on both sides and painted on one side. Eleven pages survive of a twenty-page book. The lower portions of the pages are badly damaged by moisture, eroding and staining bottom of each page. The eleventh page is particularly badly damaged with only the central portion remaining, making it unclear whether this page belongs to the codex or not. The greatest height of any of the surviving page fragments is  and the average page width is .<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Five single sheets of bark paper were found associated with the codex, they had no stucco coating and were brown and water stained. Two of these had adhered to the codex and the other three may have once been with the codex but had separated. One of these sheets had a painted line in the same red <a href="hematite" class="uri" title="wikilink">hematite</a> pigment used in the codex itself. A smaller sheet of bark paper was attached to the lined sheet and this smaller piece was submitted for <a href="radiocarbon_dating" title="wikilink">radiocarbon dating</a>. This testing produced a date for the sheet of AD 1230 &lt;U+00B1&gt; 130.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>Each page of the codex has been painted on one side with a standing figure facing left. Each figure holds a weapon and most grip a rope leading to a restrained captive. Colours used on the codex include hematite red, black, blue-green, a red wash and a brown wash, all upon a strong white background. The left-hand side of each page is marked by a column of day signs; where this column is complete these total thirteen in all. Each day sign is associated with a <a href="Maya_numerals" title="wikilink">bar-and-dot</a> numerical coefficient.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Six pages depict a figure bearing weapons and accompanied by a captive (pages 1&lt;U+2013&gt;4, 6 and 9),<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> two pages (5 and 8) both depict a figure hurling a dart at a temple.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Page 7 of the codex shows a passive warrior standing in front of a tree. Page 11 depicts a <a href="Maya_death_gods" title="wikilink">death god</a> with a javelin, pointing his weapon at a water vessel containing a snail.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Page 10 is a badly damaged fragment with the subject largely obliterated. Based on the surviving portion, Michael Coe thought it depicted a standing figure wearing a waterbird headdress and bearing an <a href="atlatl" class="uri" title="wikilink">atlatl</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The figures represented on each page differ from those on the other Maya codices and are far more similar to the <a href="Mixtec_writing" title="wikilink">Mixtec codices</a> and <a href="Toltec" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toltec</a> art styles of central Mexico. The heads of the death gods painted in the <em>Grolier Codex</em> are almost identical to those represented in the <em><a href="Codex_Laud" title="wikilink">Laud Codex</a></em> and <em><a href="Codex_Fej&lt;U+00E9&gt;rv&lt;U+00E1&gt;ry-Mayer" title="wikilink">Fej&lt;U+00E9&gt;rv&lt;U+00E1&gt;ry-Mayer Codex</a></em>, including the red colouring of the portion of the teeth closest to the gums.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The pages of the <em>Grolier Codex</em> contain seven hieroglyphs representing days; the style of these <a href="glyph" title="wikilink">glyphs</a> differs from that of the other three Maya codices but is most similar to the glyphs of the <em>Dresden Codex</em>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The glyphs are arranged in vertical columns incorporating day signs accompanied by a number; each date corresponds to a manifestation of Venus.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Whereas the Venus almanac in the <em>Dresden Codex</em> documents the planet after <a href="Conjunction_(astronomy)#Superior_and_inferior" title="wikilink">inferior conjunction</a> as the morning star, the <em>Grolier Codex</em> documents all four of the stations of Venus: rising after inferior conjunction as morning star in the east, disappearance before superior conjunction, reappearance as evening star in the west and disappearance before inferior conjunction.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Grolier_Club.jpg" title="fig:The Codex was first displayed at the Grolier Club in New York, hence its name" alt="The Codex was first displayed at the Grolier Club in New York, hence its name" /> The codex is said to have been found enclosed in a wooden box in a dry cave in the highlands of Chiapas near Tortuguero;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> it was said to have been found with a turquoise mask that is now in the collection of <a href="Dumbarton_Oaks" title="wikilink">Dumbarton Oaks</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In 1965 Mexican collector Dr. Josu&lt;U+00E9&gt; S&lt;U+00E1&gt;enz was taken by two men on a light plane to a remote airstrip in the foothills of the <a href="Sierra_Madre_de_Chiapas" title="wikilink">Sierra Madre</a> near <a href="Tortuguero_(Maya_site)" title="wikilink">Tortuguero</a> in <a href="Tabasco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tabasco</a> state;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> the compass of the plane was covered with a cloth but S&lt;U+00E1&gt;enz recognized his approximate location.

<h2 id="authenticity">Authenticity</h2>
<p>English <a href="Mayanist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mayanist</a> <a href="J._Eric_S._Thompson" title="wikilink">J. Eric S. Thompson</a> cast strong doubts upon the authenticity of the <em>Grolier Codex</em> in his 1975 article <em>The Grolier Codex</em>, published in volume 27 of the <em>Contributions of the University of California</em>. Thompson argued that the codex was a modern forgery and that the unusual mix of styles in the document was not due to the mixing of cultures but rather due to the hand of a forger.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Thompson queried the illustration of all four stations of Venus in the codex, noting that other Mesoamerican codices only illustrated the more spectacular appearance of Venus as morning star.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Following Thompson's attack upon the veracity of the codex, a number of scholars published their opinions that the document is genuine over the course of the 1980s and early 1990s, including <a href="John_B._Carlson" title="wikilink">John B.

<p>The radiocarbon dating of an associated sheet of unstuccoed bark paper had been used to support a 13th-century date for the <em>Grolier Codex</em>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Large quantities of pre-Columbian bark paper have been found in dry caves, so a genuine piece of blank pre-Columbian paper may have been used by a forger as a base for painting a falsified codex.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The fact that the codex is painted on one side only while the three uncontested Maya codices are all painted on both sides has been used as an argument against its authenticity,<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> although Michael Coe has argued that parts of non-Maya <a href="Mesoamerican_literature" title="wikilink">Mesoamerican codices</a> had sometimes been left blank for many years before being painted in a style distinct from the opposite side.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Baudez, in his 2002 critique of the <em>Grolier Codex</em>, noted that the fact that the codex is only painted on one side is irrelevant in determining its authenticity, since there are many examples of Mesoamerican codices not being painted on both sides.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Further doubts have been cast upon how S&lt;U+00E1&gt;enz acquired the codex and the iconography of the document itself. Archaeologist Donna Yates considers that Coe's account of S&lt;U+00E1&gt;enz beings contacted by an unnamed person and flown to a remote airstrip by unidentified persons to be &quot;fantastical&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> As of 2012, the authenticity of the document was still disputed.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="iconography">Iconography</h3>
<p><img src="Grolier_Codex,_page_9.jpg" title="fig:The captive on page 9 of the Grolier Codex has a sense of perspective that is alien to Mesoamerican art" alt="The captive on page 9 of the Grolier Codex has a sense of perspective that is alien to Mesoamerican art" /> The numbering systems used in the codex conflict. The Maya bar-and-dot system is used to mark units, but the central Mexican dot system is used to mark multiples of twenty (for example by using 11 dots instead of 2 bars and a dot, as would be the case in the bar-and-dot system where a bar indicates 5 and a dot indicates 1).<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Some bar-and-dot numbers are placed within a <a href="Cartouche_(design)" title="wikilink">cartouche</a> decorated with a knot at the top. The only other instance of such a cartouche being used with numbers is in the Dresden Codex, where the cartouche has a very specific function, indicating a negative date count from the zero year of the great cycle of the <a href="Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar" title="wikilink">Mesoamerican Long Count calendar</a> (roughly equivalent to the function of BC in the <a href="Gregorian_calendar" title="wikilink">Gregorian calendar</a>). In the <em>Grolier Codex</em>, where the numbers mark intervals between stations of Venus, the use of this cartouche appears meaningless.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>In the <em>Grolier Codex</em> captives are shown bound with cords leading to their necks, however the most common convention in Mesoamerican art is the depiction of captives bound by the arms or wrists.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Some of the figures in the codex represent deities (on pages 1&lt;U+2013&gt;2, 4&lt;U+2013&gt;6 and 9) and some represent mortal warriors without supernatural attributes (on pages 3, 7 and 8). Both the deities and the mortals are performing the same actions such as the capture of a prisoner, or conquest symbolised by a spear passing through a temple.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Although the codex depicts the stations of Venus, none of the warlike figures is identified with attributes normally associated with the planet in Maya or central Mexican art. On page 9, a bound captive is depicted from a high point of view with a sense of perspective that French Mesoamericanist and iconographer Claude-Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Baudez considers is alien to Mesoamerican art.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> <a href="God_K" title="wikilink">God K</a> (K'awiil) is depicted twice in the codex but is incorrectly shown with human incisors instead of snake fangs.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<p>The paper used for the <em>Grolier Codex</em> appears to be authentic pre-Columbian bark paper and the contents of the document have not been copied directly from any of the generally accepted Maya codices, although they do resemble pages 46 to 50 of the Dresden Codex. A number of <a href="Nondestructive_testing" title="wikilink">non-destructive techniques</a> have been applied to the codex in an effort to authenticate it,and the results were published in 2008. The analysis revealed that only pre-Columbian materials had been used in its creation; no modern inorganic materials were detected. Some inconsistencies were revealed however; cuts along the page edges seem to have been made with a sharp blade in order to give the appearance of natural wear and tear and the supposed water staining did not permeate the paper. The researchers commented that the staining appeared to be the result of drops of dye or ink being applied to the surface of the codex. In conclusion the researchers were unable to support or refute the pre-Columbian nature of the codex.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Unusually for a document that supposedly was stored in a cave for centuries, the paint of the codex still appears fresh and this is considered .<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="testing">Testing</h4>
<p>The codex was tested in the Instituto de F&lt;U+00ED&gt;sica of the <a href="National_Autonomous_University_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Universidad Nacional Aut&lt;U+00F3&gt;noma de M&lt;U+00E9&gt;xico</a> in Mexico City using a 3 <a href="Electronvolt" title="wikilink">megaelectronvolt</a> <a href="pelletron" class="uri" title="wikilink">pelletron</a> particle accelerator. Testing methods applied to the codex included <a href="ultraviolet" class="uri" title="wikilink">ultraviolet</a> imaging, <a href="Infrared#Art_history" title="wikilink">infrared reflectography</a>, <a href="Optical_microscope" title="wikilink">optical microscopy</a>, <a href="particle-induced_X-ray_emission" title="wikilink">particle-induced X-ray emission</a> and <a href="Rutherford_backscattering_spectrometry" title="wikilink">Rutherford backscattering spectrometry</a> (RBS). The specific aim of this non-destructive testing was to compare the materials used in the codex with those used in other pre-Columbian codices.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>The testing showed that the base layer onto which the codex was painted is composed of <a href="gypsum" class="uri" title="wikilink">gypsum</a>, a material used as a <a href="Gesso" title="wikilink">base layer</a> for paintings since antiquity. The black paint was analysed with RBS and found to be a carbon-based pigment consistent with other pre-Columbian Mexican codices.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The red colour used in the codex is <a href="red_ochre" title="wikilink">red ochre</a>, an iron-based pigment.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> There is not much blue colouration in the <em>Grolier Codex</em> and the presence of the distinctive <a href="Maya_Blue" title="wikilink">Maya Blue</a> pigment could not be confirmed. Analysis revealed the blue pigment used on the codex does not contain <a href="cobalt" class="uri" title="wikilink">cobalt</a> and does contain clay. The investigators concluded that the codex does contain some original pre-Columbian materials but could not confirm that the document is authentic.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
