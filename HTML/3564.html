<p>Beginning November 1, 1909, Dok created a daily cartoon to accompany <em>The Weather</em>,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> which featured a character who came to be known as the <a href="Robert_W._Patten" title="wikilink">Umbrella Man</a>, or &quot;Sport&quot;. In the newspaper on May 3, 1913, the weather comic was called <em>The Umbrella Man</em>, in a front&lt;U+2013&gt;page box naming the paper's features. Later on, as Dok began to do more cartooning, he gave Sport a sidekick, named the Kid.</p>
<h4 id="the-kid">The Kid</h4>
<p><em>The Kid</em> was a talking duck. He was not part of the <em>Dippy Duck</em> or <em>The Waddles</em> cartoon strips, but was the sidekick to the Umbrella Man.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> He became a regular feature on the front page of <em>The Seattle Times</em>. Like the Umbrella Man, the Kid sometimes sported an umbrella hat. The two wandered the streets of Seattle in the comic, dispensing wit and wisdom along with weather forecasts.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>DOK's comic strip, <em>Dok's Dippy Duck</em> started out as a daily comic strip without a name, May 31, 1912.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In the early strip, the unnamed duck stood around on the street corner picking fights with whomever passed by.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Doc's duck became a traveler during World War I and the cartoons show him interacting with both sides of the conflict.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The duck in this cartoon is also known as <em>The Kid</em>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>On May 3, 1913, in a front-page box called &quot;Features of Today's Paper&quot;, Dok's cartoon was called &quot;<em>The Duck</em>. By Dok.&quot;</p>
<p>On February 10, 1915, the strip was named <em>Dok's Dippy Duck</em> with no change in what was happening in the plot; the February 10 strip addressed what had happened in the previous day's strip.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> One change that did happen was to make the comic vertical and larger, with fewer frames; it had only four frames,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> where earlier strips had as many as seven.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>This cartoon has been characterized by a comic historian as one of the pioneers of humanized animal comic strips.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
