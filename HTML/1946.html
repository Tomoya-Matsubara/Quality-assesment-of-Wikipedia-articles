<p><strong>Luke Pryor Blackburn</strong> (June 16, 1816September 14, 1887) was an American physician, philanthropist, and politician from <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a>. He was elected the <a href="List_of_Governors_of_Kentucky" title="wikilink">28th</a> <a href="governor_of_Kentucky" title="wikilink">governor of Kentucky</a>, serving from 1879 to 1883. Until the election of <a href="Ernie_Fletcher" title="wikilink">Ernie Fletcher</a> in 2003, Blackburn was the only physician to serve as governor of Kentucky. After earning a medical degree at <a href="Transylvania_University" title="wikilink">Transylvania University</a>, Blackburn moved to <a href="Natchez,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Natchez, Mississippi</a>, and gained national fame for implementing the first successful <a href="quarantine" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarantine</a> against <a href="yellow_fever" title="wikilink">yellow fever</a> in the <a href="Mississippi_embayment" title="wikilink">Mississippi River valley</a> in 1848. He came to be regarded as an expert on yellow fever and often worked <em><a href="pro_bono" title="wikilink">pro bono</a></em> to combat outbreaks. Among his philanthropic ventures was the construction of a hospital for boatmen working on the <a href="Mississippi_River" title="wikilink">Mississippi River</a> using his personal funds. He later successfully lobbied <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">Congress</a> to construct a series of similar hospitals along the Mississippi.</p>
<p>Although too old to serve in the military, Blackburn supported the Confederate cause during the Civil War. In the early days of the war, he acted as a civilian agent for the governments of Kentucky and Mississippi. By 1863, he was aiding Confederate blockade runners in Canada. In 1864, he traveled to Bermuda to help combat a yellow fever outbreak that threatened Confederate blockade running operations there. Shortly after the war's end, a Confederate double agent accused him of having carried out a plot to start a yellow fever epidemic in the Northern United States that would have hampered the Union war effort. Blackburn was accused of collecting linens and garments used by yellow fever patients and smuggling them into the Northern states to be sold. The evidence against Blackburn was considerable, although much of it was either circumstantial or provided by witnesses of questionable reputation. Although he was acquitted by a Toronto court, public sentiment was decidedly against him throughout much of the United States. Today, historians still disagree as to the strength of the evidence supporting Blackburn's role in the alleged plot. Any plot of this nature was destined to fail, however; in 1900, Walter Reed discovered that yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes, not by contact.</p>
<p>Blackburn remained in Canada to avoid prosecution by U.S. authorities, but he returned to his home country in 1868 to help combat a yellow fever outbreak along the <a href="Gulf_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Gulf</a> Coast of Texas and <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a>. Although the charges against him had not been dropped, he was not arrested or prosecuted. He rehabilitated his public image by rendering aid in yellow fever outbreaks in <a href="Memphis,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, in 1873, <a href="Fernandina,_Florida" title="wikilink">Fernandina, Florida</a>, in 1877, and <a href="Hickman,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Hickman, Kentucky</a>, in 1878. Dubbed the &quot;Hero of Hickman&quot;, Blackburn's ministrations propelled him to the <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic</a> gubernatorial nomination the following year. In the general election, he defeated <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> <a href="Walter_Evans_(American_politician)" title="wikilink">Walter Evans</a> by a wide margin. As governor, Blackburn won passage of several reforms in the areas of state finance and internal improvements, but his signature accomplishments were in the area of penal reform. Troubled by the conditions at the penitentiary in <a href="Frankfort,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Frankfort</a>, Blackburn attempted to ease overcrowding through liberal use of his gubernatorial pardon, earning him the derisive nickname &quot;Lenient Luke&quot;. He also secured approval of the construction of a <a href="Kentucky_State_Penitentiary" title="wikilink">new penitentiary</a> at <a href="Eddyville,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Eddyville</a>, the adoption of a warden system to replace the corrupt private oversight of the old penitentiary, and the implementation of the state's first parole system. Although his record of reform led historians to laud him as &quot;the father of <a href="prison_reform" title="wikilink">prison reform</a> in Kentucky&quot;, his liberal pardon record and expenditure of scarce taxpayer money to improve the living conditions of prisoners was unpopular at the time, and he was booed and shouted down at his own party's nominating convention in 1883. After his term as governor, he returned to his medical practice and died in 1887. The <a href="Blackburn_Correctional_Complex" title="wikilink">Blackburn Correctional Complex</a>, a minimum-security penal facility near <a href="Lexington,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Lexington, Kentucky</a>, was named in his honor in 1972.</p>

To a large degree, his pleas fell upon deaf ears, with the exception of his proposal for the state board of health, which was created in March 1878. Soon after, news came that yellow fever had appeared in the lower Mississippi Valley earlier than usual; by August 1878, it had reached epidemic proportions. Blackburn advocated implementing quarantines to deal with the influx of people fleeing north to escape the disease, but many of the state's doctors did not believe yellow fever could survive as far north as Kentucky. Some towns in the <a href="Jackson_Purchase" title="wikilink">Jackson Purchase</a> region attempted to implement crude quarantines, but the city of Louisville completely ignored Blackburn's advice and welcomed refugees from the South. Blackburn temporarily halted his gubernatorial campaign and traveled to Louisville to help treat those who arrived there already suffering from the disease.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>

Blackburn arrived on September 7 to find that roughly 20 percent of the town's population were ill with yellow fever. He organized cleanup crews to disinfect the town and a squad of Negroes to guard vacated homes. In late September, when it appeared the Hickman epidemic was waning, Blackburn traveled to <a href="Chattanooga,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Chattanooga</a> and <a href="Martin,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Martin, Tennessee</a>, to render aid, but within ten days, he received word that the outbreak in Hickman had resurged and spread to nearby <a href="Fulton,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Fulton, Kentucky</a>.

<p>In late May 1879, the Republican-leaning <em>Cincinnati Gazette</em> reported on Blackburn's alleged plot to infect northern cities with yellow fever during the Civil War, apparently the first time the incident had been reported in Kentucky. The newspaper formed a special department for the sole purpose of investigating the claims against Blackburn and published a daily column in which it related the department's findings. In the wake of the <em>Gazette</em>'s investigation, other Northern newspapers, including the <em><a href="The_Repository" title="wikilink">Canton Repository</a></em>, <em>Cleveland Herald</em>, and <em><a href="Philadelphia_Press" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Press</a></em>, derided Kentuckians for even considering the election of Blackburn (who they nicknamed &quot;Dr. Blackvomit&quot;). The scandal gained more traction nationally than in Kentucky. Blackburn did not respond to the accusations, and Kentucky Republicans barely made mention of it, knowing that the northern press in general and the <em>Cincinnati Gazette</em> in particular were widely distrusted in the state. Kentucky newspaper editor <a href="Henry_Watterson" title="wikilink">Henry Watterson</a> opined that most Kentuckians already knew about Blackburn's Civil War activities and either explicitly approved of them or were apathetic about events that had occurred a decade and a half earlier.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>

<p>In response to recommendations from the governor, the General Assembly enacted cost-saving reforms in the judicial system, including the abolition of criminal, chancery, and common pleas courts, dividing the state instead into 18 circuit court districts.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> The number of jurors required for certain cases was reduced, juror salaries were set at a fixed rate, and penalties were established for soliciting jury duty.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> Reimbursement amounts for transporting and caring for prisoners were capped to prevent inflation of costs by local law enforcement.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> Salaries of state officials were reduced by 20 percent.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> The state <a href="property_tax" title="wikilink">property tax</a> was also increased from 40 to 45 cents per $100 of taxable property, and laws were strengthened to facilitate the collection of delinquent taxes.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a><a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>

<p>Blackburn's primary focus was on reforms to the state's penal system.

<p>The poor conditions at the penitentiary were partially due to the fact that the state leased management of the facility to private contractors, who frequently neglected prisoners' needs to cut costs.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> These contractors often provided benefits such as cheap laundry services and free meals to legislators to secure contracts and encourage them to ignore their abuse of prisoners.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> Blackburn called for the contract system to be replaced with a system of oversight by wardens employed by the state.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>
<p>Before the General Assembly could act on his recommendations, Blackburn began granting <a href="clemency" title="wikilink">pardons</a> to relieve prison overcrowding.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> He particularly favored clemency for the incurably sick so they could go home to die with their families.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> During his term, Blackburn pardoned over one thousand individuals, earning him the nickname &quot;Lenient Luke&quot;.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> The pardons were extremely unpopular with both the public and the Democratic political establishment.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> Several newspapers claimed that Blackburn sold pardons for two dollars apiece, though no evidence exists to support such an accusation.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
