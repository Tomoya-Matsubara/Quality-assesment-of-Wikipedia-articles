Though originally only appearing in <a href="platform_game" title="wikilink">platform games</a>, starting with <em><a href="Donkey_Kong_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Donkey Kong</a></em>, Mario currently appears in varied video game genres such as <a href="Mario_Kart" title="wikilink">racing</a>, <a href="List_of_Mario_games_by_genre#Puzzle_series" title="wikilink">puzzle</a>, <a href="Mario_role-playing_games" title="wikilink">role-playing</a>, <a href="Super_Smash_Bros._(series)" title="wikilink">fighting</a>, and <a href="List_of_Mario_games_by_genre#Sports_series" title="wikilink">sports</a>.</p>
<p>Mario is depicted as a short, pudgy, <a href="Italian_American" title="wikilink">Italian-American</a> <a href="plumber" class="uri" title="wikilink">plumber</a> who lives in the <a href="Mushroom_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Mushroom Kingdom</a>.

<p>As Nintendo's mascot, Mario is arguably the most famous character in video game history,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and his image is commonly associated with video games. <em>Mario</em> games, as a whole, have sold more than 210 million units,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> making the <em>Mario</em> series the best-selling video game series of all time. Outside <a href="platform_game" title="wikilink">platform games</a>, he has appeared in video games of other genres, including the <em><a href="Mario_Kart" title="wikilink">Mario Kart</a></em> racing series, sports games, such as the <em><a href="Mario_Tennis" title="wikilink">Mario Tennis</a></em> and <em><a href="Mario_Golf" title="wikilink">Mario Golf</a></em> series, and <a href="Console_role-playing_game" title="wikilink">role-playing games</a> such as <em><a href="Paper_Mario" title="wikilink">Paper Mario</a></em> and <em>Super Mario RPG</em>. He has also inspired television shows, film, comics, and a line of licensed merchandise.</p>
<h2 id="concept-and-creation">Concept and creation</h2>
<p><img src="Mario_emblem.svg" title="fig:Seen on his hat, Mario&#39;s emblem represents him in the interfaces of many of the games he has appeared in." alt="Seen on his hat, Mario&#39;s emblem represents him in the interfaces of many of the games he has appeared in." width="150" /> Mario was created by <a href="Shigeru_Miyamoto" title="wikilink">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> in his attempts to produce a best-selling video game for <a href="Nintendo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nintendo</a>, after previous titles, such as <em><a href="Sheriff_(arcade_game)" title="wikilink">Sheriff</a></em>, had not achieved the same success as other titles such as <em><a href="Pac-Man" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pac-Man</a></em>. Originally, Miyamoto wanted to create a video game that used the characters <a href="Popeye" class="uri" title="wikilink">Popeye</a>, <a href="Bluto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bluto</a>, and <a href="Olive_Oyl" title="wikilink">Olive Oyl</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> At the time, however, Miyamoto was unable to acquire a license to use the characters (and would not until <a href="Popeye_(video_game)" title="wikilink">1982</a>), and ended up making Jumpman (later known as Mario), <a href="Donkey_Kong_(character)" title="wikilink">Donkey Kong</a>, and <a href="Pauline_(Nintendo)" title="wikilink">Pauline</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In the early stages of the game, Mario was unable to jump, and the focus was to escape a maze. However, Miyamoto added in that ability, saying &quot;If you had a barrel rolling towards you, what would you do?&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Mario's name was originally &quot;Mr. Video&quot;, and he was to be used in every video game Miyamoto developed.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> This idea was inspired by <a href="manga" class="uri" title="wikilink">manga</a> artists such as <a href="Osamu_Tezuka" title="wikilink">Osamu Tezuka</a> and <a href="Fujio_Akatsuka" title="wikilink">Fujio Akatsuka</a>, who feature <a href="Osamu_Tezuka&#39;s_Star_System" title="wikilink">several characters across multiple manga</a>, as well as British director <a href="Alfred_Hitchcock" title="wikilink">Alfred Hitchcock</a>, who appears in most of his own films. During localization of the game for American audiences, Nintendo of America's warehouse landlord <a href="Mario_Segale" title="wikilink">Mario Segale</a> confronted its then-president <a href="Minoru_Arakawa" title="wikilink">Minoru Arakawa</a>, demanding back rent. Following a heated argument in which the Nintendo employees eventually convinced Segale he would be paid, they opted to name the character in the game Mario after him.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Miyamoto had commented that if he had named him Mr. Video, he likely would have &quot;disappeared off the face of the Earth&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> By Miyamoto's own account, Mario's profession was chosen to fit with the game design. Since the game was set on a construction site, Mario was made into a carpenter. When he appeared again in <em><a href="Mario_Bros." title="wikilink">Mario Bros.</a></em>, it was decided he should be a plumber, since a lot of the game is played in underground settings.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Mario's character design, particularly his large nose, draws on western influences; once he became a plumber, Miyamoto decided to &quot;put him in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York</a>&quot; and make him Italian,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> lightheartedly attributing Mario's nationality to his mustache.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Other sources have Mario's profession chosen to be carpenter in an effort to depict the character as an ordinary hard worker, and make it easier for players to identify with the him;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> after a colleague suggested that Mario more resembled a plumber, Miyamoto changed his profession accordingly and developed <em>Mario Bros.</em>,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> featuring the character in the sewers of New York City.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Due to the graphical limitations of arcade hardware at the time, Miyamoto clothed the character in bright red overalls and a blue shirt to contrast against each other and the background. A cap was added to let Miyamoto avoid drawing the character's hairstyle, forehead, and eyebrows, as well as to circumvent the issue of animating his hair as he jumped.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> To make him appear human onscreen despite his small size, Mario was given distinct features, prominently a large nose and a mustache, which avoided the need to draw a mouth and facial expressions on the small onscreen character.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Miyamoto developed Mario with the idea of using him as a &quot;go to&quot; character that could be put in any title as needed, albeit in cameo appearances as at the time he was not expecting Mario to become popular.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> To this end he originally called the character &quot;Mr. Video&quot;, comparing his intent to have Mario appear in later games to the cameos done by <a href="Alfred_Hitchcock" title="wikilink">Alfred Hitchcock</a> within his films.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Over time, Mario's appearance has become more defined; both a red &quot;M&quot; in a white circle on the front of his hat and gold buttons on his overalls have been added. Miyamoto attributed this process to the different development teams and artists for each game as well as advances in technology as time has gone on.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Nintendo has never revealed Mario's full name, stating only that it was not &quot;Mario Mario&quot; despite the implication of the <em>Mario Bros.</em> series' title, its use in the <a href="Super_Mario_Bros._(film)" title="wikilink">film</a>, and information given in the <a href="Prima_Games" title="wikilink">Prima</a> official Guidebook to <em><a href="Mario_and_Luigi:_Superstar_Saga" title="wikilink">Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga</a></em>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>Mario debuted as &quot;Jumpman&quot; in the arcade game <em><a href="Donkey_Kong_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Donkey Kong</a></em> in 1981.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> He is shown as a carpenter that has a pet ape.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The carpenter mistreats the ape, so <a href="Donkey_Kong_(character)" title="wikilink">Donkey Kong</a> escapes and kidnaps Jumpman's girlfriend, originally known as the Lady, but later named <a href="Recurring_characters_in_the_Mario_series#Pauline" title="wikilink">Pauline</a>. The player must take the role of Jumpman and rescue the girl. He was first named &quot;Mario&quot; in the arcade game <em><a href="Donkey_Kong_Junior_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Donkey Kong Junior</a></em> in 1982, the only game in which he has ever been portrayed as an antagonist. In the 1983 arcade game <em><a href="Mario_Bros." title="wikilink">Mario Bros.</a></em> Mario and his younger brother <a href="Luigi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luigi</a> are portrayed as Italian-American plumbers,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> who have to defeat creatures that have been coming from the sewers below <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>.

To reach each castle, Mario battles through three &quot;sub-worlds&quot; by defeating or avoiding King Koopa's henchmen. If Mario successfully fights his way through the castle and defeats the minion, a <a href="Toad_(Nintendo)" title="wikilink">Mushroom Retainer</a> is freed.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Inside the eighth castle, Mario has a final fight with King Koopa and frees Princess Toadstool. Later, in <em><a href="Super_Mario_Bros._2" title="wikilink">Super Mario Bros. 2</a></em>, the player could choose between Mario and his friends <a href="Luigi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luigi</a>, <a href="Toad_(Nintendo)" title="wikilink">Toad</a>, or <a href="Princess_Peach" title="wikilink">Princess Peach</a>. Each character possesses unique abilities, with Mario being the most well-rounded. In <em><a href="Super_Mario_Bros._3" title="wikilink">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> Mario embarks on a quest to save the rulers of seven kingdoms from <a href="Bowser_(character)" title="wikilink">Bowser</a> and his children, the <a href="Koopalings" class="uri" title="wikilink">Koopalings</a> and travel across eight worlds to restore order to the Mushroom World and rescue Princess Peach.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Mario is introduced to new <a href="power-up" title="wikilink">power-ups</a> that augment his abilities.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

Mario then sets out to rescue her from Tatanga, traveling through the four geographical areas of Sarasaland and defeating Tatanga's minions along the way.

The inhabitants are now brainwashed into thinking that Wario is their master and Mario is their enemy. Wario's motive behind this sudden attack was to take control over Mario's castle in order to have a palace of his own. To stop Wario, Mario finds the 6 Golden Coins throughout Mario Land and regains access to his castle. In <em><a href="Super_Mario_World_2:_Yoshi&#39;s_Island" title="wikilink">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</a></em>, a <a href="stork" class="uri" title="wikilink">stork</a> carries Baby Mario and Baby Luigi across the sea, but the evil <a href="Magikoopa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Magikoopa</a> <a href="Kamek" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kamek</a> emerges and steals Baby Luigi, and Baby Mario falls onto an island in the middle of the sea called Yoshi's Island, home to Yoshis.

<h2 id="abilities">Abilities</h2>
<p>During the development of <em><a href="Donkey_Kong_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Donkey Kong</a></em>, Mario was known as <strong>Jumpman</strong>.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Jumping&lt;U+2014&gt;both to access places and as an offensive move&lt;U+2014&gt;is a common gameplay element in <em>Mario</em> games, especially the <em><a href="Super_Mario_Bros." title="wikilink">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> series. By the time <em><a href="Super_Mario_RPG:_Legend_of_the_Seven_Stars" title="wikilink">Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars</a></em> was released, jumping became such a signature act of Mario that the player was often tasked with jumping to prove to NPCs that he was Mario. Mario's most commonly portrayed form of attack is jumping to stomp on the heads of enemies, first used in <em><a href="Super_Mario_Bros." title="wikilink">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> This jump-stomp move may entirely crush smaller enemies on the stage, and usually deals damage to larger ones, sometimes also causing secondary effects.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> This attack often enables Mario to knock the turtle-like <a href="Enemies_in_the_Mario_series#Koopa_Troopa" title="wikilink">Koopa Troopas</a> into or out of their shells, which can be used as weapons.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Subsequent games have elaborated on Mario's jumping-related abilities. <em><a href="Super_Mario_World" title="wikilink">Super Mario World</a></em> added the ability to spin-jump, which allows Mario to break blocks beneath him. Later, the Game Boy version of <em><a href="Donkey_Kong_(Game_Boy)" title="wikilink">Donkey Kong</a></em> allowed Mario to jump higher with consecutive jumps, and perform a back-flip. In <em><a href="Super_Mario_64" title="wikilink">Super Mario 64</a></em>, Mario gains new jumping abilities, such as a sideways somersault, a ground pound, and the &quot;Wall Kick&quot;, which propels him upwards by kicking off walls.</p>

These powers have appeared regularly throughout the series.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Throughout the series' history, there have been several kinds of Mushroom power-ups, including the <a href="1-Up" class="uri" title="wikilink">1-Up</a> Mushroom, which gives Mario an extra life; the Poison Mushroom, which causes Mario to either shrink or die;<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> the Mega Mushroom, which causes Mario to grow very large; and the Mini Mushroom, which causes Mario to shrink.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> A common power-up throughout the series is an item that gives Mario the ability of flight.

The game also has an ice flower, which gives the player the ability to shoot ice balls, but does not help with ice or water environments. <a href="Super_Mario_Galaxy" title="wikilink">Super Mario Galaxy</a> had an ice flower, but this allowed the player to temporarily walk on water and lava without sinking or taking damage, by placing ice platforms wherever the player stood.</p>
