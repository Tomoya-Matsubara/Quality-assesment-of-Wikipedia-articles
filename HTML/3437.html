<p>&quot;<strong>Our Father</strong>&quot; is the <a href="Dexter_(season_3)" title="wikilink">third season</a> <a href="season_premiere" title="wikilink">premiere</a> and twenty-fifth overall episode of the American <a href="television_drama_series" title="wikilink">television drama series</a> <em><a href="Dexter_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Dexter</a></em>, which first aired on September 28, 2008 on <a href="Showtime_(TV_network)" title="wikilink">Showtime</a> in the United States.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The episode was written by <a href="Clyde_Phillips" title="wikilink">Clyde Phillips</a> and directed by <a href="Keith_Gordon" title="wikilink">Keith Gordon</a>. In the episode, which takes place several months after the second season finale, <a href="Dexter_Morgan" title="wikilink">Dexter Morgan</a> (<a href="Michael_C._Hall" title="wikilink">Michael C. Hall</a>) mistakenly kills an innocent man but forms a friendship with the man's brother, well-known assistant district attorney <a href="List_of_Dexter_characters#Miguel_Prado" title="wikilink">Miguel Prado</a> (<a href="Jimmy_Smits" title="wikilink">Jimmy Smits</a>). Dexter's sister <a href="List_of_Dexter_characters#Ofr./Det._Deborah_&quot;Debra&quot;_Morgan" title="wikilink">Debra</a> (<a href="Jennifer_Carpenter" title="wikilink">Jennifer Carpenter</a>), meanwhile, has turned over a new leaf in her life and is determined to become a detective.</p>
<p>To carry the remainder of the third season, <em>Dexter</em>{{'}}s writers introduced Miguel as a new character so that his relationship with Dexter could serve as a &quot;central arc&quot;. In order to allow them to explore Dexter's psychological and emotional reactions, the writers revealed Dexter's girlfriend <a href="List_of_Dexter_characters#Rita_Bennett/Rita_Morgan" title="wikilink">Rita Bennett</a> (<a href="Julie_Benz" title="wikilink">Julie Benz</a>) to be pregnant. They also had Dexter kill an innocent person to develop the ongoing theme of rebellion despite initially rejecting the idea of Dexter killing &quot;somebody who doesn't deserve it&quot;. Filming of the episode began in early June in <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> at <a href="Sunset_Gower_Studios" title="wikilink">Sunset Gower Studios</a>, though a small crew flew to <a href="Miami" class="uri" title="wikilink">Miami</a>, <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a>, where the show is set, to film short pieces of Dexter, which were integrated into &quot;Our Father&quot; and other episodes. The episode brought in 1.22 million viewers, an improvement from second season's <a href="It&#39;s_Alive!_(Dexter)" title="wikilink">premiere</a> and finale, and attracted mixed reviews from critics.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>Several months after the deaths of his colleague <a href="List_of_Dexter_characters#James_Doakes" title="wikilink">Sgt. James Doakes</a> and his <a href="Narcotics_Anonymous" title="wikilink">Narcotics Anonymous</a> sponsor <a href="List_of_Dexter_characters#Lila_West.2F.22Lila_Tournay.22" title="wikilink">Lila Tournay</a>, Dexter's life has returned to normal. He looks up a drug dealer, <a href="List_of_Dexter_characters#Fred_&quot;Freebo&quot;_Bowman" title="wikilink">Fred &quot;Freebo&quot; Bowman</a> (<a href="Mike_Erwin" title="wikilink">Mike Erwin</a>), whom he believes to have killed two female college students. Pretending to want to buy <a href="black_tar_heroin" title="wikilink">heroin</a>, Dexter visits Freebo's house, where he sees Freebo's girlfriend <a href="List_of_Dexter_characters#Teegan_Campbell" title="wikilink">Teegan Campbell</a> (Jelly Howie). He returns to the house at night and finds Freebo fighting with another man (Nick Hermz). When the man attacks Dexter, Dexter stabs and kills him in self-defense. Dexter flees, shocked about breaking his father <a href="List_of_Dexter_characters#Harry_Morgan" title="wikilink">Harry</a>'s &quot;code&quot; and killing an innocent person. He is called to the scene the following day and discovers that the man was <a href="List_of_Dexter_characters#Oscar_Prado" title="wikilink">Oscar Prado</a>, the brother of well-known assistant district attorney Miguel Prado. Miguel seeks an explanation and consolation from Dexter, and invites him to Oscar's wake. Dexter attends, leaving Debra alone on their dead father's birthday. He begins to question Harry's code and whether his loyalty is necessary.</p>
<p>In the police department, <a href="List_of_Dexter_characters#Det./Sgt._Angelo_&quot;Angel&quot;_Batista" title="wikilink">Det. Angel Batista</a> (<a href="David_Zayas" title="wikilink">David Zayas</a>) is promoted to a sergeant. Debra has changed her hairstyle and given up men, alcohol and cigarettes. <a href="List_of_Dexter_characters#Joseph_.22Joey.22_Quinn" title="wikilink">Det. Joey Quinn</a> (<a href="Desmond_Harrington" title="wikilink">Desmond Harrington</a>), recently transferred to the department, is being investigated by Internal Affairs. <a href="List_of_Dexter_characters#Yuki_Amado" title="wikilink">Sgt. Yuki Amado</a> (<a href="Liza_Lapira" title="wikilink">Liza Lapira</a>) asks Debra repeatedly to keep an eye on Quinn, but Debra declines even when she discovers that &quot;snitching&quot; may earn her a detective's shield. She discovers from one of Quinn's <a href="narc_(narcotics)" title="wikilink">informants</a>, <a href="List_of_Dexter_characters#Anton_Briggs" title="wikilink">Anton Briggs</a> (David Ramsey), that Oscar was a drug addict, but after she loudly divulges the information in Miguel's presence, Lt. <a href="Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a_LaGuerta" title="wikilink">Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a LaGuerta</a> (<a href="Lauren_V&lt;U+00E9&gt;lez" title="wikilink">Lauren V&lt;U+00E9&gt;lez</a>) asks that Batista remove her from the case. Batista does so and instead puts her on the case of a &quot;<a href="John_Doe" title="wikilink">Jane Doe</a>&quot;, who Dexter recognizes as Teegan.</p>
<p>Dexter's personal life is going well; his relationship with Rita has become more amorous and he is bonding with her children, <a href="List_of_Dexter_characters#Cody_and_Astor_Bennett" title="wikilink">Astor</a> (<a href="Christina_Robinson_(actress)" title="wikilink">Christina Robinson</a>) and <a href="List_of_Dexter_characters#Cody_and_Astor_Bennett" title="wikilink">Cody</a> (<a href="Preston_Bailey" title="wikilink">Preston Bailey</a>). Rita craves chocolate pudding and, recalling the last instance of this, realizes that she is <a href="pregnant" class="uri" title="wikilink">pregnant</a>.</p>

Smits was not initially interested in joining the cast, but after Phillips explained Miguel's dark side to him, Smits accepted the job offer because it was an opportunity to play a character dissimilar to any he had played before.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He said, &quot;They promised upfront that this was really going to challenge me, that it would be stuff that I haven't done before, and they've really given me a shot.

<p>Production was scheduled to commence in late May,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> but was delayed until early June.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> A small crew flew to <a href="Miami" class="uri" title="wikilink">Miami</a> with Hall and, according to producer Sara Colleton, filmed &quot;a lot of pieces&lt;U+2014&gt;not just Dexter walking in and out of his door or car, but also scenes that we know we'll need and can use&quot;, before returning to the show's permanent <a href="television_set" title="wikilink">sets</a> at <a href="Sunset_Gower_Studios" title="wikilink">Sunset Gower Studios</a> in <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>&quot;Our Father&quot; brought in 1.22 million viewers, a 20 percent improvement on both the second season's premiere and finale, and Showtime's highest-rated drama <a href="season_premiere" title="wikilink">season premiere</a> since 2004 when <a href="Nielsen_Media_Research" title="wikilink">Nielsen Media Research</a> began compiling their <a href="Nielsen_ratings" title="wikilink">ratings</a> for premium networks.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In the United Kingdom, the episode was the ninth most-watched program in its timeslot with 194,000 viewers and an audience share of 1.2 percent, a significant decline from &quot;<a href="It&#39;s_Alive!_(Dexter)" title="wikilink">It's Alive!</a>&quot;, the second season premiere.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;Our Father&quot; received mixed reviews from critics; some thought that it was dull, though others commended Smits' performance. Alan Sepinwall of <em><a href="The_Star-Ledger" title="wikilink">The Star-Ledger</a></em> said that he was &quot;frustrated&quot; by the episode despite not finding any faults with it, writing, &quot;I can't help thinking that I've seen as much of <a href="Dexter_Morgan" title="wikilink">Dexter Morgan</a>'s world as I need to.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Matt Fowler, writing for <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a>, thought that the revelation of Rita's pregnancy was &quot;an interesting development, but not necessarily something that instantly catapults me to the edge of my seat&quot; but that Smits as Miguel could improve &quot;even [a] great [show] like <em>Dexter</em>&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Australian" title="wikilink">The Australian</a></em>{{'}}s Stephen Romei felt that, with the beginning of the third season, &quot;<em>Dexter</em> has gone from an eight to a six&quot; on a scale of one to ten, saying that the show &quot;has lost its edge&quot; with the hypocrisy of Dexter being a supposed sociopath despite holding several relationships.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em> critic Claire Zulkey was &quot;not sure yet whether [the third season's changes are] good&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Ray Ellis of <em><a href="Blogcritics" class="uri" title="wikilink">Blogcritics</a></em> felt that &quot;the series has settled into a state of complacency&quot; and could not &quot;escape the feeling I've seen this before&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> On the other hand, the <em><a href="San_Francisco_Chronicle" title="wikilink">San Francisco Chronicle</a></em>{{'}}s Tim Goodman wrote that &quot;the whiff of normalcy for Dexter&quot; gives viewers &quot;a magnificent tease&quot; and likened the fast-moving plot to &quot;the urgency of brilliance&quot;.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> <a href="TV_Squad" title="wikilink">TV Squad</a> critic Debra McDuffee was &quot;pleasantly surprised by Smits&quot; and said that, thus far, &quot;season three is a good one&quot;.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> <em><a href="TV_Guide" title="wikilink">TV Guide</a></em>{{'}}s Paula Paige, who was &quot;thrilled&quot; to see Smits join the cast, said, &quot;What the <em>Dexter</em> season three opener lacked in explosive excitement, it certainly made up for in Jimmy Smits.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Daniel Fienberg, writing for <a href="Tribune_Media_Services" title="wikilink">Zap2it</a>, said that the combination of Hall and Smits was &quot;as good as TV acting gets&quot; and that, in comparison to the second season's opening, &quot;the show's creative team appears to have done it again&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
