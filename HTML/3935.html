<p>The <strong>Wainwright Building</strong> (also known as the <strong>Wainwright State Office Building</strong>) is a 10-story red-brick landmark office building at 709 Chestnut Street in <a href="Downtown_St._Louis" title="wikilink">downtown</a> <a href="St._Louis,_Missouri" title="wikilink">St. Louis, Missouri</a>. Built between 1890 and 1891<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and designed by <a href="Dankmar_Adler" title="wikilink">Dankmar Adler</a> and <a href="Louis_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Louis Sullivan</a>, it was among the first <a href="skyscraper" title="wikilink">skyscrapers</a> in the world. It was named for local financier <a href="Ellis_Wainwright" title="wikilink">Ellis Wainwright</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>It is described as &quot;a highly influential prototype of the modern office building&quot; by the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Architect <a href="Frank_Lloyd_Wright" title="wikilink">Frank Lloyd Wright</a> called the Wainwright Building &quot;the very first human expression of a tall steel office-building as Architecture.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The building is currently owned by the State of Missouri and houses state offices.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="commission-design-and-construction">Commission, design and construction</h2>
<p>The Wainwright building was commissioned by Ellis Wainwright, a St. Louis brewer. Wainwright needed office space to manage the St Louis Brewers Association.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> It was the second major commission for a tall building won by the <a href="Adler_&amp;_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Adler &amp; Sullivan</a> firm, which had grown to international prominence after the creation of the ten-story <a href="Auditorium_Building" title="wikilink">Auditorium Building</a> in Chicago (designed in 1886 and completed in 1889).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> As designed, the first floor of the Wainwright Building was intended for street-accessible shops, with the second floor filled with easily accessible public offices. The higher floors were for &quot;honeycomb&quot; offices, while the top floor was for water tanks and building machinery.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>Aesthetically, the Wainwright Building exemplifies Sullivan's theories about the tall building, which included a tripartite (three-part) composition (base-shaft-attic) based on the structure of the classical column,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and his desire to emphasize the height of the building. He wrote: &quot;[The skyscraper] must be tall, every inch of it tall. The force and power of altitude must be in it the glory and pride of exaltation must be in it. It must be every inch a proud and soaring thing, rising in sheer exultation that from bottom to top it is a unit without a single dissenting line.&quot; His 1896 article cited his Wainwright Building as an example.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Louis_Sullivan_-_cornice_detail_-_Wainwright_Building,_Seventh_+_Chestnut_Streets,_Saint_Louis,_St._Louis_City_County,_MO.jpg" title="fig:The intricate work along the top of the building" alt="The intricate work along the top of the building" /> Historian <a href="Carl_W._Condit" title="wikilink">Carl W. Condit</a> described the Wainwright as &quot;a building with a strong, vigorously articulated base supporting a screen that constitutes a vivid image of powerful upward movement.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The base contained retail stores that required wide glazed openings; Sullivan's ornament made the supporting <a href="pier_(architecture)" title="wikilink">piers</a> read as pillars. Above it the semi-public nature of offices up a single flight of stairs are expressed as broad windows in the <a href="curtain_wall" title="wikilink">curtain wall</a>. A <a href="cornice" class="uri" title="wikilink">cornice</a> separates the second floor from the grid of identical windows of the screen wall, where each window is &quot;a cell in a honeycomb, nothing more&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Ornament_(art)" title="wikilink">ornamentation</a> for the building, largely confined to the wide frieze below the deep cornice, expresses the formalized yet naturalistic celery-leaf foliage typical of Sullivan and published in his <em>System of Architectural Ornament</em>. It is pierced by unobtrusive <a href="Oeil-de-boeuf" title="wikilink">bull's-eye windows</a> that light the top-story floor, originally containing water tanks and elevator machinery. The building includes embellishments of <a href="glazed_architectural_terra-cotta" title="wikilink">terra cotta</a>,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> a building material that was newly-invented at the time of construction.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Some architectural elements from the building have been removed in renovations and taken to the <a href="Sauget,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Sauget, Illinois</a> storage site of the <a href="St._Louis_Building_Arts_Foundation" title="wikilink">St. Louis Building Arts Foundation</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The Wainwright building was initially rescued from demolition by the <a href="National_Trust_for_Historic_Preservation" title="wikilink">National Trust for Historic Preservation</a> when the Trust took an option on the structure. <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Later, it was acquired by Missouri as part of a state office complex and the St. Louis Landmarks Association, in one of its early victories, is credited with having rescued the Wainwright Building from a construction project.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The neighboring Lincoln Trust building (later known as the Title Guaranty building; designed by <a href="Eames_and_Young" title="wikilink">Eames and Young</a>, built in 1898 at 706 Chestnut St.) was demolished to make way for the <a href="Gateway_Mall_(St._Louis)" title="wikilink">Gateway Mall</a> in 1983. Carolyn Toft, Landmarks Association's executive director, stated that this building &quot;... formed an ensemble with three other late-19th century commercial buildings, including [the Wainwright Building], that could not be equaled anywhere else in the country. Saving the Wainwright was important, but how much more important it would have been to save the entire group.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>After a period of neglect, the building now houses Missouri state offices.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1968, the building was designated as a <a href="National_Historic_Landmark" title="wikilink">National Historic Landmark</a> <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and in 1972 it was named a city landmark. <a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Architect John D. Randall led an extensive letter-writing campaign to the governor and other noted officials; the campaign resulted in the restoration of the building as a state office building instead of its demolition.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Along with the <a href="Guaranty_Building_(Buffalo,_New_York)" title="wikilink">Guaranty Building</a> of <a href="Buffalo,_New_York" title="wikilink">Buffalo, New York</a>, the Wainwright is among only two surviving Sullivan skyscrapers.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
