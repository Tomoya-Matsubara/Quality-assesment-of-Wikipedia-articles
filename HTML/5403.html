<p>In May 1973 Shakur was involved in a shootout on the <a href="New_Jersey_Turnpike" title="wikilink">New Jersey Turnpike</a>, during which <a href="New_Jersey_State_Police" title="wikilink">New Jersey State Trooper</a> Werner Foerster and BLA member Zayd Malik Shakur were killed and Shakur and Trooper James Harper were wounded.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Between 1973 and 1977, Shakur was <a href="Indictment" title="wikilink">indicted</a> in relation to six other alleged criminal incidents&lt;U+2014&gt;charged with <a href="murder" class="uri" title="wikilink">murder</a>, <a href="attempted_murder" title="wikilink">attempted murder</a>, <a href="robbery" title="wikilink">armed robbery</a>, <a href="bank_robbery" title="wikilink">bank robbery</a>, and <a href="kidnapping" class="uri" title="wikilink">kidnapping</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;resulting in three <a href="acquittal" title="wikilink">acquittals</a> and three <a href="motion_(legal)#Motion_to_dismiss" title="wikilink">dismissals</a>.

<p>Shakur was then incarcerated in several prisons, where her treatment drew criticism from some <a href="human_rights" title="wikilink">human rights</a> groups. She escaped from prison in 1979 and has been living in <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a> in <a href="political_asylum" title="wikilink">political asylum</a> since 1984.

<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Shakur was born in <a href="Jamaica,_Queens" title="wikilink">Jamaica, Queens</a>, New York City on July 16, 1947 <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> where she lived for three years with her parents and grandparents, Lula and Frank Hill.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> After her parents divorced in 1950, she spent most of her childhood in <a href="Wilmington,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Wilmington, North Carolina</a>, with her grandmother until her family relocated to Queens when she was a teenager.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> For a time, she ran away from home and lived with strangers until she was taken in by her aunt, Evelyn Williams, later her lawyer.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> She <a href="Dropping_out" title="wikilink">dropped out</a> of high school, but later earned a <a href="General_Educational_Development" title="wikilink">general equivalency diploma</a> (GED) with her aunt's help.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> She attended <a href="Borough_of_Manhattan_Community_College" title="wikilink">Borough of Manhattan Community College</a> and then the <a href="City_College_of_New_York" title="wikilink">City College of New York</a> (CCNY) in the mid-1960s, where she was involved in many political activities, protests, and sit-ins.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Shakur was arrested for the first time in 1967 with 100 other Manhattan Community College students, on charges of <a href="trespass" title="wikilink">trespassing</a>. The students had chained and locked the entrance to a college building to protest a curriculum deficient in <a href="Africana_studies" title="wikilink">Black Studies</a> and a lack of Black faculty.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> She married Louis Chesimard, a fellow student-activist at CCNY, in April 1967, divorcing him in December 1970. Shakur devotes only one paragraph of her autobiography to her marriage, attributing its termination to disagreements related to <a href="gender_roles" title="wikilink">gender roles</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>After graduation from CCNY at 23, Shakur became involved in the Black Panther Party (BPP), eventually becoming a leading member of the <a href="Harlem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harlem</a> branch.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Prior to joining the BPP, Shakur had met several of its members on a 1970 trip to <a href="Oakland,_California" title="wikilink">Oakland, California</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> One of Shakur's main activities with the Panthers was coordinating a school breakfast program. However, she soon left the Party, charging macho behavior of males in these organizations,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> but did not go as far as <a href="Regina_Jennings" title="wikilink">other Panthers</a> who left the organization over <a href="sexual_harassment" title="wikilink">sexual harassment</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Instead, Shakur's main criticism of the Black Panther Party was its alleged lack of focus on <a href="African_diaspora" title="wikilink">black history</a>:</p>
<dl>

<dd>&quot;The basic problem stemmed from the fact that the BPP had no systematic approach to political education. They were reading the <a href="Quotations_from_Chairman_Mao_Zedong" title="wikilink">Red Book</a> but didn't know who <a href="Harriet_Tubman" title="wikilink">Harriet Tubman</a>, <a href="Marcus_Garvey" title="wikilink">Marcus Garvey</a>, and <a href="Nat_Turner" title="wikilink">Nat Turner</a> were. They talked about intercommunalism but still really believed that the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a> was fought to free the slaves. A whole lot of them barely understood any kind of history, Black, African or otherwise. [...] That was the main reason many Party members, in my opinion, underestimated the need to unite with other Black organizations and to struggle around various community issues.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a>

<p>That same year she changed her name to Assata Shakur<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and joined the Black Liberation Army (BLA), &lt;U+201C&gt;a <a href="Stratocracy" title="wikilink">politico-military</a> organization, whose primary objective (was) to fight for the independence and self-determination of Afrikan people in the United States.&lt;U+201D&gt; <a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In 1971, Shakur joined the <a href="Republic_of_New_Afrika" title="wikilink">Republic of New Afrika</a>,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> an organization formed to create an independent Black majority nation composed of <a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a>, <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>, <a href="Alabama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alabama</a>, <a href="Mississippi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mississippi</a>, and <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

According to police, Shakur knocked on the door of a room occupied by an out-of-town guest and asked &quot;Is there a party going on here?&quot; to which the occupant responded in the negative.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Shakur then allegedly displayed a revolver and a struggle ensued, during which she was shot.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> She was booked on charges of attempted robbery, <a href="felony" title="wikilink">felonious</a> <a href="assault" class="uri" title="wikilink">assault</a>, <a href="endangerment" title="wikilink">reckless endangerment</a>, and possession of a deadly weapon, then released on <a href="bail" class="uri" title="wikilink">bail</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Shakur is alleged to have said that she was glad that she had been shot since now that she had experienced what it was like she was no longer afraid to be shot again.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Following an August 23, 1971, bank robbery in Queens, Shakur was sought for questioning, and a photograph of a woman (who was later alleged to be Shakur) with thick rimmed black glasses, a high hairdo pulled tightly over her head, and a steadily pointed gun became ubiquitous in banks and full page print ads paid for by the New York Clearing House Association.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> On December 21, 1971, Shakur was named as one of four suspects by New York City police in a hand grenade attack that destroyed a police car and slightly injured two patrolmen in <a href="Maspeth,_Queens" title="wikilink">Maspeth, Queens</a>; a 13 state alarm was issued three days after the attack when a witness identified Shakur and Andrew Jackson from FBI photographs.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Atlanta law enforcement officials said that Shakur and Jackson had lived together for several months in <a href="Atlanta,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Atlanta, Georgia</a>, in the summer of 1971.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>The state's case rested largely on the testimony of two men who had pleaded guilty to participating in the holdup.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> The prosecution called four witnesses: Avon White and John Rivers (both of whom had already been convicted of the robbery) and the manager and teller of the bank.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> White and Rivers, although convicted, had not yet been sentenced for the robbery and were promised that the charges would be dropped in exchange for their testimony.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> White and Rivers testified that Shakur had guarded one of the doors with a <a href=".357_magnum" title="wikilink">.357 magnum</a> pistol and that Sadiki had served as a lookout and drove the getaway truck during the robbery; neither White nor Rivers was cross-examined due to the defense attorney's refusal to participate in the trial.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> Shakur's aunt and lawyer, Evelyn Williams, was also cited for contempt after walking out of the courtroom after many of her attempted motions were denied.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> The trial was delayed for a few days after Shakur was diagnosed with <a href="pleurisy" class="uri" title="wikilink">pleurisy</a>.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a></p>
<p>During the trial, the defendants were escorted to a &quot;holding pen&quot; outside the courtroom several times after shouting complaints and epithets at Judge Gagliardi.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> While in the holding pen, they listened to the proceedings over loudspeakers.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> Both defendants were repeatedly cited for <a href="contempt_of_court" title="wikilink">contempt of court</a> and eventually barred from the courtroom, where the trial continued in their absence.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> A contemporary <em><a href="New_York_Times" title="wikilink">New York Times</a></em> editorial criticized Williams for failing to maintain courtroom &quot;decorum&quot;, comparing her actions to William Kunstler's recent contempt conviction for his actions during the &quot;<a href="Chicago_Seven" title="wikilink">Chicago Seven</a>&quot; trial.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<p>Sadiki's lawyer, Robert Bloom, attempted to have the trial dismissed and then postponed due to new &quot;revelations&quot; regarding the credibility of White, a former co-defendant working for the prosecution.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> Bloom had been assigned to defend Hilton over the summer, but White was not disclosed as a government witness until right before the trial.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> Judge Gagliardi instructed both the prosecution and the defense not to bring up Shakur or Sadiki's connections to the BLA, saying they were &quot;not relevant&quot;.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> Gagliardi denied requests by the jurors to pose questions to the witnesses&lt;U+2014&gt;either directly or through him&lt;U+2014&gt;and declined to provide the jury with information they requested about how long the defense had been given to prepare, saying it was &quot;none of their concern&quot;.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> This trial resulted in a <a href="hung_jury" title="wikilink">hung jury</a> and then a mistrial when the jury reported to Gagliardi that they were hopelessly deadlocked for the fourth time.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> Although none of the jurors spoke publicly about the deliberations, the jury was reportedly deadlocked at 11 to 1 for conviction.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a><a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>

<p>The retrial was delayed for one day to give the defendants more time to prepare.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> The new jury selection was marked by attempts by Williams to be relieved of her duties due to disagreements with Shakur as well as Hilton's attorney.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> Judge Arnold Bauman denied the application, but directed another lawyer, Howard Jacobs, to defend Shakur while Williams remained the attorney of record.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> Shakur was ejected following an argument with Williams, and Hilton left with her as jury selection continued.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> After the selection of twelve jurors (60 were excused), Williams was allowed to retire from the case, with Shakur officially representing herself, assisted by lawyer Florynce Kennedy.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> In the retrial, White testified that the six alleged robbers had saved their hair clippings to create disguises, and identified a partially obscured head and shoulder in a photo taken from a surveillance camera as Shakur's.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> Kennedy objected to this identification on the grounds that the prosecutor, assistant United States attorney Peter Truebner, had offered to <a href="Stipulated_judgment" title="wikilink">stipulate</a> that Shakur was not depicted in any of the photographs.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Although both White and Rivers testified that Shakur was wearing overalls during the robbery, the person identified as Shakur in the photograph was wearing a jacket.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> The defense attempted to discredit White on the grounds that he had spent eight months in Matteawan Hospital for the Criminally Insane in 1968, and White countered that he had faked insanity (by claiming to be <a href="Allah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Allah</a> in front of three psychiatrists) to get transferred out of prison.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
<p>Shakur personally cross-examined the witnesses, getting White to admit that he had once been in love with her; the same day, one juror (who had been frequently napping during the trial) was replaced with an alternate.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> Like the first trial, the retrial was marked by the defendants leaving and/or being thrown out of the court room for periods of varying lengths.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> Both defendants were acquitted in the retrial; six jurors interviewed after the trial stated that they did not believe the two key prosecution witnesses.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> Shakur was immediately returned to <a href="Morristown,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Morristown, New Jersey</a>, under a heavy guard following the trial.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> Louis Chesimard (Shakur's ex-husband) and Paul Stewart, the other two alleged robbers, had been acquitted in June.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>

<p>Shakur herself was called as a witness on March 15, the first witness called by the defense; she denied shooting either Harper or Foerster, and also denied handling a weapon during the incident.

<li id="fn52">According to Churchill and Vander Wall (2002): &quot;What had emerged in the 1980s was a formal amalgamation of FBI COINTELPRO specialists and New York City red squad detectives known as the Joint Terrorist Task Force (JTTF), consolidating the more <em>ad hoc</em> models of such an apparatus which had materialized in cities like Chicago and Los Angeles during the late '60s&quot; (p. 309); &quot;JTTF: The Joint Terrorist Task Force, created in the late 1970s as an interlock between the FBI and New York City red squads to engage in COINTELPRO-type activities&quot; (p. xiii).<a href="#fnref52" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn53">Williams, 1993, p. 3.<br />
&quot;It was the spring of 1973 and for the last two years the nationwide dragnet for her capture had intensified each time a young African American identified as a member of the BLA was arrested or wounded or killed. The Joint Terrorist Task Force, made up of the FBI and local police agencies across the country, issued daily bulletins predicting her imminent apprehension each time another bank had been robbed or another cop had been killed. Whenever there was a lull in such occurrences, they leaked information, allegedly classified as 'confidential,' to the media, repeating past accusations and flashing her face across television screens and newspapers with heartbeat regularity, lest the public forget.&quot;<a href="#fnref53" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
