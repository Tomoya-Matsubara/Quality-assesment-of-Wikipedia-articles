Kamen</strong> (born <a href="April_5" title="wikilink">April 5</a>, <a href="1951" class="uri" title="wikilink">1951</a>) is an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="entrepreneur" class="uri" title="wikilink">entrepreneur</a> and <a href="inventor" class="uri" title="wikilink">inventor</a>. Born in <a href="Rockville_Centre,_New_York" title="wikilink">Rockville Centre</a>, <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, he attended <a href="Worcester_Polytechnic_Institute" title="wikilink">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a>, but dropped out before graduating. His father is <a href="Jack_Kamen" title="wikilink">Jack Kamen</a>, an illustrator of <em><a href="Weird_Science_(comic)" title="wikilink">Weird Science</a></em> and other <a href="EC_Comics" title="wikilink">EC Comics</a>.</p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<h3 id="inventions">Inventions</h3>
<p>Kamen is probably most well-known to the public from the publicity surrounding the product that eventually became known as the <a href="Segway_HT" title="wikilink">Segway HT</a>, an electric, self-balancing human transporter with a complex, computer-controlled <a href="gyroscope" title="wikilink">gyroscopic</a> stabilization and control system that keeps the device balanced on two horizontally-placed wheels and controlled by moving body weight. The machine's development was the object of much speculation and hype after segments of a book quoting <a href="Steve_Jobs" title="wikilink">Steve Jobs</a> and other notable <a href="information_technology" title="wikilink">IT</a> visionaries espousing its society-revolutionising potential were leaked in January <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>.</p>
<p>Kamen has worked extensively on a project involving <a href="Stirling_engine" title="wikilink">Stirling engine</a> designs, attempting to create a machine that would generate power while serving as a <a href="water_purification" title="wikilink">water purification</a> system. He hopes the project will help improve living standards in developing countries. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Kamen has also invented a <a href="pneumatics" title="wikilink">compressed-air</a>-powered device which would launch a human into the air in order to quickly launch <a href="SWAT" class="uri" title="wikilink">SWAT</a> teams or other emergency workers to the roofs of tall, inaccessible buildings.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>However, Kamen was already a successful and wealthy inventor, after inventing the <a href="AutoSyringe" class="uri" title="wikilink">AutoSyringe</a>, a new type of mobile <a href="dialysis" class="uri" title="wikilink">dialysis</a> system for medical applications, the first <a href="insulin_pump" title="wikilink">insulin pump</a>, and an all-terrain electric <a href="wheelchair" class="uri" title="wikilink">wheelchair</a> known as the <a href="iBOT" class="uri" title="wikilink">iBOT</a> using many of the same gyroscopic balancing technologies that later made their way into the Segway.</p>
<h3 id="awards">Awards</h3>
<p>During his career Kamen has won numerous awards. He was elected to the <a href="National_Academy_of_Engineering" title="wikilink">National Academy of Engineering</a> in 1997 for his biomedical devices and for making engineering more popular among high school students.

In April 2002, Kamen was awarded the <a href="Lemelson-MIT_Prize" title="wikilink">Lemelson-MIT Prize</a> for inventors for his invention of the Segway and of an infusion pump for <a href="diabetes_mellitus" title="wikilink">diabetics</a>. In 2005 he was inducted into the <a href="National_Inventors_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">National Inventors Hall of Fame</a> for his invention of the AutoSyringe. In 2006 Kamen was awarded the Global Humanitarian Action Award by the United Nations. Kamen received an honorary &quot;Doctor of Engineering &quot; degree from <a href="Kettering_University" title="wikilink">Kettering University</a> in 2001, as well as from the <a href="Wentworth_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Wentworth Institute of Technology</a> when he spoke at the college's centennial celebration in 2004, and another honorary doctorate from <a href="Bates_College" title="wikilink">Bates College</a> in 2007.<a href="http://www.bates.edu/x157811.xml">1</a></p>
<h3 id="first">FIRST</h3>
<p>In 1989, Kamen founded the <a href="robotics" class="uri" title="wikilink">robotics</a> organization, <a href="FIRST" class="uri" title="wikilink">FIRST</a> (<strong>F</strong>or <strong>I</strong>nspiration and <strong>R</strong>ecognition of <strong>S</strong>cience and <strong>T</strong>echnology), for <a href="high_school" title="wikilink">high school</a> students. In <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, it held over 30 regional competitions and one international competition. In 2007, 37 competitions were held in places across the world such as Israel, Brazil, Canada, and the U.S.A.. Kamen remains the driving force behind the organization, providing over 1,000 high schools with the tools needed to learn valuable engineering skills. FIRST has gained a great deal of publicity from companies such as <a href="Bausch_and_Lomb" title="wikilink">Bausch and Lomb</a>, <a href="CNN" class="uri" title="wikilink">CNN</a>, <a href="General_Motors" title="wikilink">General Motors</a>, <a href="Google" class="uri" title="wikilink">Google</a>, <a href="Microsoft" class="uri" title="wikilink">Microsoft</a>, <a href="Coca-Cola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Coca-Cola</a>, <a href="Boston_Gears" title="wikilink">Boston Gears</a>, <a href="Motorola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Motorola</a>, <a href="Delphi_(auto_parts)" title="wikilink">Delphi</a>, <a href="Kodak" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kodak</a>, <a href="Johnson_and_Johnson" title="wikilink">Johnson and Johnson</a>, <a href="Xerox" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xerox</a>, and <a href="Harris_Corporation" title="wikilink">Harris</a>,<a href="Underwriter&#39;s_Labratories" title="wikilink">Underwriter's Labratories</a>, <a href="Microchip" class="uri" title="wikilink">Microchip</a>, as well as many Universities and colleges.</p>

<p>Kamen is currently single, claiming he's &quot;married to his inventions.&quot; His primary residence is a <a href="hexagon" title="wikilink">hexagonal</a> <a href="shed_style" title="wikilink">shed style</a> mansion he has dubbed Westwind<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, located in <a href="Bedford,_New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">Bedford</a>, <a href="New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">New Hampshire</a>, just outside of the larger city of <a href="Manchester,_New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">Manchester</a>. The house has at least four different levels and is very eclectically conceived, with such things as hallways resembling mine shafts, <a href="1960s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1960s</a> novelty furniture, spiral staircases and secret passages, an observation tower, a fully-equipped machine shop, and a huge cast-iron steam engine which once belonged to <a href="Henry_Ford" title="wikilink">Henry Ford</a> built into the center atrium of the house (which is actually small in comparison), which Kamen has had converted into a <a href="Stirling_engine" title="wikilink">Stirling engine</a>-powered <a href="kinetic_sculpture" title="wikilink">kinetic sculpture</a>.</p>
<p>Also on the property there is a softball field regularly used by the local police force. Kamen owns two helicopters, which he regularly uses to commute to work, and has a hangar built into the house as well.</p>
<p>During 2007 at the <a href="FIRST" class="uri" title="wikilink">FIRST</a> Robotics competition held in <a href="Atlanta,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Atlanta, Georgia</a>, <a href="YouTube" class="uri" title="wikilink">YouTube</a> (which sponsors FIRST) co-founder <a href="Chad_Hurley" title="wikilink">Chad Hurley</a> announced a competition for the teams to create a video in which they would describe what it takes to start a FIRST robotics team in an imaginative way. The prize for the winning team is a visit and guided tour of Dean Kamen's house and property. The competition is currently on-going and still taking submissions.</p>
<p>His company, <a href="DEKA" class="uri" title="wikilink">DEKA</a>, annually creates intricate mechanical presents for Dean Kamen. Recently, the company created a robotic chess player, which is a mechanical arm attached to a chess board.</p>

" alt="Dean Kamen&#39;s home on North Dumpling Island. A wind turbine, seen in the right side of the picture, is used to generate electricity. " /> Kamen owns the small <a href="North_Dumpling_Island" title="wikilink">North Dumpling Island</a> off the coast of <a href="Connecticut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Connecticut</a>, and has &quot;declared&quot; the island to be an <a href="independent_state" title="wikilink">independent state</a>, along with its own currency in increments of Pi (pioneered by <a href="Donald_Knuth" title="wikilink">Donald Knuth</a>). His home (pictured) is located on the west side of the island. An assembly of pillars resembling <a href="Stonehenge" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stonehenge</a> is located near the house, although its function and significance are currently unknown. Excess electricity is sold to the state of Connecticut. In Spring of 2006, an <a href="amphibious_vehicle" title="wikilink">amphibious vehicle</a>, similar to a <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">WWII</a> <a href="DUKW" class="uri" title="wikilink">DUKW</a>, was observed parked next to one of the buildings on the island.</p>
