A noted <a href="statesman" class="uri" title="wikilink">statesman</a>, <a href="orator" class="uri" title="wikilink">orator</a> and <a href="strategist" class="uri" title="wikilink">strategist</a>, Churchill was also an <a href="Officer_(armed_forces)" title="wikilink">officer</a> in the <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a>. A prolific <a href="author" class="uri" title="wikilink">author</a>, he won the <a href="Nobel_Prize_in_Literature" title="wikilink">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> in 1953 for his own historical writings.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>During his army career Churchill saw combat with the <a href="Malakand_Field_Force" title="wikilink">Malakand Field Force</a> on the <a href="Northwest_Frontier" title="wikilink">Northwest Frontier</a>, at the <a href="Battle_of_Omdurman" title="wikilink">Battle of Omdurman</a> in the <a href="Sudan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sudan</a> and during the <a href="Second_Boer_War" title="wikilink">Second Boer War</a> in <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africa</a>. During this period he also gained fame, and not a small amount of notoriety, as a correspondent. At the forefront of the political scene for almost sixty years, Churchill held numerous political and cabinet positions. Before the <a href="First_World_War" title="wikilink">First World War</a>, he served as <a href="President_of_the_Board_of_Trade" title="wikilink">President of the Board of Trade</a> and <a href="Home_Secretary" title="wikilink">Home Secretary</a> during the <a href="Liberal_Government_1905-1915" title="wikilink">Liberal governments</a>. In the First World War Churchill served in numerous positions, as <a href="First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty" title="wikilink">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>, <a href="Minister_of_Munitions" title="wikilink">Minister of Munitions</a>, <a href="Secretary_of_State_for_War" title="wikilink">Secretary of State for War</a> and <a href="Secretary_of_State_for_Air" title="wikilink">Secretary of State for Air</a>.

During the <a href="Interwar_period" title="wikilink">interwar years</a>, he served as <a href="Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer" title="wikilink">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, Churchill was appointed <a href="First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty" title="wikilink">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>. Following the resignation of <a href="Neville_Chamberlain" title="wikilink">Neville Chamberlain</a> in May 1940, he became <a href="Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a> and led Britain to victory against the <a href="Axis_powers_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">Axis powers</a>. His speeches were a great inspiration to the embattled <a href="Allies_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">Allied forces</a>. After losing <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1945" title="wikilink">the 1945 election</a>, Churchill became the leader of the opposition. In 1951, Churchill again became Prime Minister before finally retiring in 1955. Upon his death, he was granted the honour of a <a href="state_funeral" title="wikilink">state funeral</a> which saw one of the largest assemblies of politicians in the world.</p>

John Churchill's mother was a first cousin several times removed of the explorer Sir <a href="Francis_Drake" title="wikilink">Francis Drake</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Winston's father, <a href="Lord_Randolph_Churchill" title="wikilink">Lord Randolph Churchill</a>, the third son of the <a href="John_Spencer-Churchill,_7th_Duke_of_Marlborough" title="wikilink">7th Duke of Marlborough</a> was a politician. Winston's mother, <a href="Jennie_Churchill" title="wikilink">Lady Randolph Churchill</a> (<em><a href="n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e" class="uri" title="wikilink">n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</a></em> Jennie Jerome), the daughter of American millionaire <a href="Leonard_Jerome" title="wikilink">Leonard Jerome</a>, was of mostly <a href="Colonial_America" title="wikilink">Colonial American</a> (ultimately <a href="English_people" title="wikilink">English</a>) descent. Churchill was born two months premature in a bedroom in <a href="Blenheim_Palace" title="wikilink">Blenheim Palace</a> in <a href="Woodstock,_Oxfordshire" title="wikilink">Woodstock</a>, <a href="Oxfordshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxfordshire</a> on <a href="30_November" title="wikilink">30 November</a> <a href="1874" class="uri" title="wikilink">1874</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He arrived eight months after his parents' hasty marriage.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He had one brother, <a href="John_Strange_Spencer-Churchill" title="wikilink">John Strange Spencer-Churchill</a>.</p>
<p>Churchill had an independent and rebellious nature and generally did poorly in school, for which he was punished. He entered <a href="Harrow_School" title="wikilink">Harrow School</a> on <a href="17_April" title="wikilink">17 April</a> <a href="1888" class="uri" title="wikilink">1888</a>, where his military career began. Within weeks of his arrival, he had joined the <a href="Combined_Cadet_Force" title="wikilink">Harrow Rifle Corps</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Churchill earned high marks in <a href="English_studies" title="wikilink">English</a> and <a href="history" class="uri" title="wikilink">history</a>; he was also the school's <a href="fencing_(sport)" title="wikilink">fencing</a> champion. He was rarely visited by his mother (then known as Lady Randolph), but wrote letters begging her to either come to the school or to allow him to come home. Churchill also had a very distant relationship with his father and Churchill once remarked how they barely talked to each other.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Due to his lack of parental contact Churchill became very close to his nanny, Elizabeth Anne Everest, whom he used to call &quot;Woomany&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="speech-impediment">Speech impediment</h3>

<p>Churchill described himself as having a &quot;speech impediment&quot;, which he consistently worked to overcome. After many years, he finally stated, &quot;My impediment is no hindrance.&quot; Although the Stuttering Foundation of America has claimed that Churchill <a href="stuttering" title="wikilink">stammered</a>, the Churchill Centre has concluded that he <a href="lisp" title="wikilink">lisped</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Churchill's impediment may also have been <a href="cluttering" class="uri" title="wikilink">cluttering</a>,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> which would fit more with his lack of attention to unimportant details and his very secure ego. Weiss suggests that Churchill may have &quot;excelled because of, rather than in spite of his cluttering.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="family-life">Family life</h3>
<p>Churchill met his future wife, <a href="Clementine_Churchill" title="wikilink">Clementine Hozier</a>, in a ball at the Crewe House, home of the <a href="Robert_Crewe-Milnes,_1st_Marquess_of_Crewe" title="wikilink">Earl of Crewe</a> and his wife, <a href="Margaret_Primrose" title="wikilink">Margaret Primrose</a> (daughter of <a href="Archibald_Primrose,_5th_Earl_of_Rosebery" title="wikilink">Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery</a>), in 1904.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In 1908, Hozier and Churchill met again at a dinner party hosted by <a href="Francis_Jeune,_1st_Baron_St_Helier#Baroness_St_Helier" title="wikilink">Lady St Helier</a>. Churchill found himself seated alongside Hozier in the dinner party, and soon later, they began their lifelong courtship.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> On <a href="August_10" title="wikilink">August 10</a> <a href="1908" class="uri" title="wikilink">1908</a>, Churchill proposed to Hozier in a house party in <a href="Blenheim_Palace" title="wikilink">Blenheim</a>, in a small <a href="Blenheim_Palace#The_Park_and_gardens" title="wikilink">Temple of Diana</a>. The engagement was announced publicly in <a href="August_15" title="wikilink">August 15</a>, 5 days after the proposal.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> On <a href="September_12" title="wikilink">September 12</a>, <a href="1908" class="uri" title="wikilink">1908</a>, Hozier and Churchill were married in <a href="Church_of_St._Margaret,_Westminster" title="wikilink">Church of St. Margaret, Westminster</a>. The church was packed; the <a href="Alfred_George_Edwards" title="wikilink">Bishop of St Asaph</a> conducted the service and <a href="James_Edward_Cowell_Welldon" title="wikilink">Bishop Welldon</a>, Churchill's headmaster at <a href="Harrow_School" title="wikilink">Harrow</a>, gave an address prior to the marriage.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>In March 1909, the couple moved to a house in 33 Eccleston Square. By that time, Clementine was deep into pregnancy with their first child. On <a href="July_11" title="wikilink">July 11</a> <a href="1909" class="uri" title="wikilink">1909</a>, in London, their first child was born, <a href="Diana_Churchill" title="wikilink">Diana Churchill</a>.

<h3 id="sandhurst">Sandhurst</h3>
<p>After Churchill left Harrow in 1893, he applied to attend the <a href="Royal_Military_College,_Sandhurst" title="wikilink">Royal Military College, Sandhurst</a>. However it took three attempts before Churchill passed the admittance exam.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Once there, Churchill did well and he graduated eighth out of a class of 150 in December 1894.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> He was immediately commissioned as a <a href="Second_Lieutenant" title="wikilink">Second Lieutenant</a> in the <a href="4th_Queen&#39;s_Own_Hussars" title="wikilink">4th Queen's Own Hussars</a> on <a href="20_February" title="wikilink">20 February</a> <a href="1895" class="uri" title="wikilink">1895</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In 1941, he received the honour of Colonel of the <a href="Queen&#39;s_Royal_Hussars#Privileges_&amp;_Traditions" title="wikilink">Hussars</a>.</p>
<p>Churchill's official biographer Martin Gilbert noted in a 1991 interview about his book, <em>Churchill: A Life</em>,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> that Churchill was accused of <a href="Sodomy" title="wikilink">buggering</a> other students while at Sandhurst. In the book Gilbert states that Churchill immediately filed a libel case against his accuser, who was the father of a young officer snubbed by Churchill and his peers in the Hussars. According to Gilbert the father withdrew the charge and settled out of court with Churchill for a sum of &lt;U+00A3&gt;400.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="war-correspondent">War correspondent</h3>
<p>Churchill's pay as a <a href="second_lieutenant" title="wikilink">second lieutenant</a> in the 4th Hussars was &lt;U+00A3&gt;300. However Churchill believed that he needed at least &lt;U+00A3&gt;500 to support a style of life in keeping with other officers of the regiment. According to biographer Roy Jenkins, this is why Churchill took an interest in war correspondence.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> When Churchill finished training he asked to be posted to areas of action in which, against all etiquette, he earned additional income as a roving war correspondent for the London newspapers.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Bill_Deedes" title="wikilink">Lord Deedes</a> explained to a gathering of the <a href="Royal_Historical_Society" title="wikilink">Royal Historical Society</a> in 2001 why Churchill went to the front line. &quot;He was with <a href="Grenadier_Guards" title="wikilink">Grenadier Guards</a>, who were dry [without alcohol] at battalion headquarters. They very much liked tea and condensed milk, which had no great appeal to Winston, but alcohol was permitted in the front line, in the trenches. So he suggested to the colonel that he really ought to see more of the war and get into the front line. This was highly commended by the colonel, who thought it was a very good thing to do.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1895, Churchill travelled to <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a> to observe the Spanish fight the Cuban guerrillas; he had obtained a commission to write about the conflict from the <em>Daily Graphic</em>. To Churchill's delight, he came under fire for the first time on his twenty-first birthday.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Churchill had fond memories of Cuba as a &quot;...large, rich, beautiful island...&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Churchill soon received word that his nanny, Mrs Everest, was dying; he then returned to England and stayed with her for a week until she died. He wrote in his journal <em>&quot;She was my favourite friend.&quot;</em> In Churchill's <em><a href="My_Early_Life" title="wikilink">My Early Life</a></em> he wrote: &quot;She had been my dearest and most intimate friend during the whole of the twenty years I had lived.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In early October 1896, he was transferred to <a href="Bombay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bombay</a>, <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a>. He was considered one of the best <a href="polo" class="uri" title="wikilink">polo</a> players in his regiment and led his team to many prestigious tournament victories.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>About this time he read Winwood Reade's <em>Martyrdom of Man</em>, a classic of Victorian <a href="atheism" class="uri" title="wikilink">atheism</a>, which completed his loss of faith in Christianity and left him with a sombre vision of a godless universe in which humanity was destined, nevertheless, to progress through the conflict between the more advanced and the more backward races. When he was posted to India and began to read avidly, to make up for lost time, Churchill was profoundly impressed by <a href="Darwinism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Darwinism</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He lost whatever religious faith he may have had through reading <a href="Edward_Gibbon" title="wikilink">Edward Gibbon</a>, he said and took a particular dislike, for some reason, to the Catholic Church, as well as Christian missions.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> He became, in his own words, &quot;a materialist to the tips of my fingers,&quot; and he fervently upheld the worldview that human life is a struggle for existence, with the outcome the survival of the fittest.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> This philosophy of life and history Churchill expressed in his one novel, <em>Savrola</em>. He passed for a time through an aggressively anti-religious phase, but this eventually gave way to a more tolerant belief in the workings of some kind of <a href="Divine_Providence" title="wikilink">divine providence</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

Later, while preparing for a leave in <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, Churchill heard that three brigades of the <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a> were going to <a href="Siege_of_Malakand" title="wikilink">fight</a> against a <a href="Pashtun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pashtun</a> tribe and he asked his superior officer if he could join the fight.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> He fought under the command of General Jeffery, who was the commander of the second brigade operating in <a href="Malakand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malakand</a>, in what is now <a href="Pakistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a>. Jeffery sent fifteen scouts and Churchill to explore the <a href="Mamund" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mamund</a> Valley; while on reconnaissance, they encountered an enemy tribe, dismounted from their horses and opened fire. After an hour of shooting, their reinforcements, the 35th <a href="Sikhs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sikhs</a> arrived, and the fire gradually ceased and the brigade and the Sikhs marched on. Hundreds of tribesmen then ambushed them and opened fire forcing them to retreat. As they were retreating four men were carrying an injured officer but the fierceness of the fight forced them to leave him behind. The man who was left behind was slashed to death in front of Churchill&lt;U+2019&gt;s eyes; afterwards he wrote of his killer, <em>&quot;I forgot everything else at this moment except a desire to kill this man&quot;</em>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> However the Sikhs' numbers were being depleted so the next commanding officer told Churchill to get the rest of the men and boys to safety.</p>
<p>Before he left he asked for a note so he would not be charged with desertion.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> He received the note, quickly signed, and headed up the hill and alerted the other brigade, whereupon they then engaged the army. The fighting in the region dragged on for another two weeks before the dead could be recovered. Churchill wrote in his journal: <em>&quot;Whether it was worth it I cannot tell.&quot;</em><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> An account of the <a href="Siege_of_Malakand" title="wikilink">Siege of Malakand</a> was published in December 1900 as the <em><a href="The_Story_of_the_Malakand_Field_Force" title="wikilink">The Story of the Malakand Field Force</a></em>.

<p>In December 1900, a dinner was given at the Waldorf-Astoria in honor of the young journalist, recently returned from his well-publicized adventures in South Africa. <a href="Mark_Twain" title="wikilink">Mark Twain</a>, who introduced him, had already, it seems, caught on to Churchill. In a brief satirical speech, Twain slyly suggested that, with his English father and American mother, Churchill was the perfect representative of Anglo-American cant. This time however he was elected, but rather than attending the opening of <a href="Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Parliament</a>, he embarked on a speaking tour throughout Britain and the United States, in the process raising &lt;U+00A3&gt;10,000 for himself. (<a href="Members_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Members of Parliament</a> were unpaid in those days and Churchill was not rich by the standards of other MPs at that time.) In both of these elections, his campaign expenses were paid for by his cousin the 9th Duke of Marlborough.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>In Parliament, Churchill became associated with a group of Tory dissidents led by <a href="Hugh_Cecil,_1st_Baron_Quickswood" title="wikilink">Lord Hugh Cecil</a> called the <a href="Hughligans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hughligans</a>, a play on words with &quot;<a href="hooligan" title="wikilink">hooligans</a>&quot;. During his first <a href="parliamentary_session" title="wikilink">parliamentary session</a>, Churchill provoked controversy by opposing what he viewed as the government's extravagant <a href="Military_budget" title="wikilink">military expenditure</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> By 1903, he was drawing away from Lord Hugh's views. He also opposed the <a href="Liberal_Unionist" title="wikilink">Liberal Unionist</a> leader <a href="Joseph_Chamberlain" title="wikilink">Joseph Chamberlain</a>, whose party was in coalition with the Conservatives. Chamberlain proposed extensive tariffs intended to protect Britain's economic dominance. This earned Churchill the detestation of his own supporters&lt;U+2014&gt;indeed, Conservative backbenchers even staged a walkout once while he was speaking.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> His own constituency effectively deselected him, although he continued to sit for Oldham until the next general election.</p>
<p>In 1904, Churchill's dissatisfaction with the Conservatives had grown so strong that, on returning from the <a href="Whitsun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Whitsun</a> recess, he <a href="Crossing_the_floor" title="wikilink">crossed the floor</a> to sit as a member of the <a href="Liberal_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Liberal Party</a>. It was rumoured at the time that his real reason in doing so was that he would receive an official salary.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> As a Liberal, he continued to campaign for <a href="free_trade" title="wikilink">free trade</a>.

As a Liberal, Churchill voted for a law that established labour rights in Britain; the 1906 <a href="Trade_Disputes_Act_1906" title="wikilink">Trade Disputes Act</a> ruled that unions were not liable for damages because of strikes.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> As President of the Board of Trade, he introduced a bill in 1908 setting up the first minimum wages in Britain -- Australia had created such a program in the 1890s -- mandating rates for both time- and piece-work for 200,000 workers in several industries. This &quot;Trade Boards Bill,&quot; Churchill told his wife on April 28, 1909 &quot;passed without a division.&quot;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>From 1903 until 1905, Churchill was also engaged in writing <em><a href="Lord_Randolph_Churchill_(book)" title="wikilink">Lord Randolph Churchill</a></em>, a two-volume biography of his father which was published in 1906 and received much critical acclaim.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> However, filial devotion caused him to soften some of his father's less attractive aspects.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> <a href="Theodore_Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, who had known Lord Randolph, reviewed the book as &quot;a clever tactful and rather cheap and vulgar life of that clever tactful and rather cheap and vulgar egotist&quot;.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Some historians suggest Churchill used the book in part to vindicate his own career and in particular to justify crossing the floor.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="growing-prominence">Growing prominence</h3>
<p>When the Liberals took office, with <a href="Henry_Campbell-Bannerman" title="wikilink">Henry Campbell-Bannerman</a> as Prime Minister, in December 1905, Churchill became <a href="Under-Secretary_of_State" title="wikilink">Under-Secretary of State</a> for the Colonies. Serving under the <a href="Secretary_of_State_for_the_Colonies" title="wikilink">Secretary of State for the Colonies</a>, <a href="Victor_Bruce,_9th_Earl_of_Elgin" title="wikilink">Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin</a>, Churchill dealt with the adoption of constitutions for the defeated <a href="Boer_Republics" title="wikilink">Boer republics</a> of the <a href="Transvaal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transvaal</a> and <a href="Orange_River_Colony" title="wikilink">Orange River Colony</a> and with the issue of 'Chinese slavery' in <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South African</a> mines.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> He also became a prominent spokesman on free trade, declaring</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why should we deny ourselves the good and varied merchandise which the traffic of the world offers, more especially since the more we trade with others, the more they must trade with us; for it is quite clear that we give them something else back for everything they give to us.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Churchill had become one of the most prominent members of the Government outside the Cabinet, and when Campbell-Bannerman was succeeded by <a href="Herbert_Henry_Asquith" title="wikilink">Herbert Henry Asquith</a> in 1908, it came as little surprise that Churchill was promoted to the Cabinet as <a href="President_of_the_Board_of_Trade" title="wikilink">President of the Board of Trade</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Under the law at the time, a newly appointed Cabinet Minister was obliged to seek re-election at a <a href="by-election" class="uri" title="wikilink">by-election</a>. Churchill lost his Manchester seat to the Conservative <a href="William_Joynson-Hicks,_1st_Viscount_Brentford" title="wikilink">William Joynson-Hicks</a> but was soon elected in another by-election at <a href="Dundee_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Dundee constituency</a>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>As President of the Board of Trade he supported <a href="David_Lloyd_George" title="wikilink">David Lloyd George</a>, the newly appointed <a href="Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer" title="wikilink">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, in opposition to the huge expenditure for the construction of Navy <a href="dreadnought" class="uri" title="wikilink">dreadnought</a> warships proposed by then <a href="First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty" title="wikilink">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>, <a href="Reginald_McKenna" title="wikilink">Reginald McKenna</a>. This campaign was ineffective. They were only able to reduce the numbers of new construction to four ships from the six originally proposed.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>Of more significance was his pursuit of radical social reforms known as the <a href="Liberal_reforms" title="wikilink">Liberal reforms</a>. <a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Most notable amongst these was the <a href="People&#39;s_Budget" title="wikilink">People's Budget</a>. The <a href="House_of_Lords" title="wikilink">House of Lords</a> vetoed the act. The Commons countered by threatening to reduce the power of the Lords and made this the main issue of two general elections in January and December of 1910. When the Liberal government won both elections they passed the <a href="Parliament_Act_1911" title="wikilink">Parliament Act 1911</a> which curtailed the powers of the House of Lords.</p>
<p><img src="Sidney_street_churchill.jpg" title="fig:Winston Churchill (highlighted) at Sidney Street, 3 January 1911" alt="Winston Churchill (highlighted) at Sidney Street, 3 January 1911" width="200" /> In 1910, Churchill was promoted to <a href="Home_Secretary" title="wikilink">Home Secretary</a>. His term as Home Secretary was to prove controversial for public opinion, after his responses to the <a href="Siege_of_Sidney_Street" title="wikilink">Siege of Sidney Street</a> and the <a href="Tonypandy_Riot" title="wikilink">dispute at the Cambrian Colliery</a> caused a degree of tension.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> On society, in 1910, he commented to <a href="Henry_Asquith" title="wikilink">Henry Asquith</a> that &quot;The unnatural and increasingly rapid growth of the feeble minded and insane classes, coupled as it is with a steady restriction among all the thrifty, energetic and superior stocks, constitutes a national and race danger which it is impossible to exaggerate...I feel that the source from which the stream of madness is fed should be cut off and sealed up before another year has passed&quot;.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> A famous photograph from the time shows the impetuous Churchill at the scene of the January 1911 <a href="Siege_of_Sidney_Street" title="wikilink">Siege of Sidney Street</a>, peering around a corner to view a gun battle between cornered anarchists and <a href="Scots_Guards" title="wikilink">Scots Guards</a>.

<p>In 1910, a number of coal miners in the Rhondda Valley began what has come to be known as the <a href="Tonypandy_Riot" title="wikilink">Tonypandy Riot</a>.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Initially, the Chief Constable of Glamorgan requested that troops be sent in to help police quell the rioting, and Churchill, when he learned that they had been started, allowed them to go as far as <a href="Swindon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Swindon</a> and <a href="Cardiff" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cardiff</a> and authorized the commanding General to advance further if he should judge it necessary. Churchill, however, blocked the use of troops fearing a repeat of the <a href="Bloody_Sunday_1887" title="wikilink">1887 Bloody Sunday</a> in <a href="Trafalgar_Square" title="wikilink">Trafalgar Square</a>. On 9 November, the <em><a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">Times</a></em> leader criticized this decision, saying that responsibility for the &quot;renewed rioting late last night...will lie with the Home Secretary [Churchill]&quot; for countermanding the Chief Constable's request for troops. In spite of this, the rumour persists that Churchill had ordered troops to attack, and Churchill's reputation in Wales and in Labour circles never recovered.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

He gave impetus to reform efforts, including development of <a href="naval_aviation" title="wikilink">naval aviation</a> (he undertook flying lessons himself)<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a>, the development of tanks, and the switch in fuel for the <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a> from <a href="coal" class="uri" title="wikilink">coal</a> to <a href="oil" class="uri" title="wikilink">oil</a>, a massive engineering task, also depending on securing <a href="Mesopotamia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mesopotamia</a>'s <a href="Mineral_rights" title="wikilink">oil rights</a>, bought in 1907 through the <a href="Burmah_Oil_Company" title="wikilink">Royal Burmah Oil Company</a>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="0242.jpg" title="fig:Winston Churchill, as the British Colonial Secretary, in Ottoman Damascus, 1912." alt="Winston Churchill, as the British Colonial Secretary, in Ottoman Damascus, 1912." /> Churchill was involved with the development of the <a href="tank" class="uri" title="wikilink">tank</a>, which was financed from naval research funds. After witnessing a demonstration in which an armoured tractor successfully demonstrated its ability to cut through a barbed wire entanglement, Churchill and <a href="Lloyd_George" title="wikilink">Lloyd George</a> decided that tanks could prove useful.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Churchill then headed the <a href="Landships_Committee" title="wikilink">Landships Committee</a> which was responsible for creating the first tank corps and, although a decade later development of the battle tank would be seen as a tactical victory, at the time it was seen as misappropriation of funds.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> The tank was deployed too early and in too small numbers, much to Churchill's annoyance.

<p>In December 1916, Asquith resigned as Prime Minister and was replaced by <a href="David_Lloyd_George" title="wikilink">David Lloyd George</a>.

<p>He became <a href="Secretary_of_State_for_the_Colonies" title="wikilink">Secretary of State for the Colonies</a> in 1921 and was a signatory of the <a href="Anglo-Irish_Treaty" title="wikilink">Anglo-Irish Treaty</a> of 1921, which established the <a href="Irish_Free_State" title="wikilink">Irish Free State</a>.

However, he stood for election yet again several months later in the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1924" title="wikilink">General Election of 1924</a>, again as an Independent candidate, this time under the label of &quot;Constitutionalist&quot; although with Conservative backing, and was finally elected to represent <a href="Epping_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Epping</a> - a <a href="statue" class="uri" title="wikilink">statue</a> in his honour in <a href="Woodford_Green" title="wikilink">Woodford Green</a> was erected when Woodford Green was part of the Epping constituency.

<h3 id="chancellor-of-the-exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</h3>
<p>He was appointed <a href="Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer" title="wikilink">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> in 1924 under <a href="Stanley_Baldwin" title="wikilink">Stanley Baldwin</a> and oversaw Britain's disastrous return to the <a href="Gold_Standard" title="wikilink">Gold Standard</a>, which resulted in deflation, unemployment, and the miners' strike that led to the <a href="UK_General_Strike_1926" title="wikilink">General Strike of 1926</a>.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>His decision, announced in the 1924 Budget, came after long consultation with various economists and the board of the Bank of England. He held a dinner at which the economist <a href="John_Maynard_Keynes" title="wikilink">John Maynard Keynes</a>, the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, Sir <a href="Otto_Niemeyer" title="wikilink">Otto Niemeyer</a> and others argued the case. This decision prompted Keynes to write <em>The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill</em>, arguing that the return to the gold standard at the pre-war parity in 1925 (&lt;U+00A3&gt;1=$4.86) would lead to a world <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">depression</a>. Interestingly, the pamphlet did not criticise the decision to return to the gold standard <em>per se</em>. However, the decision was generally popular and seen as 'sound economics' although it was opposed by <a href="Max_Aitken,_1st_Baron_Beaverbrook" title="wikilink">Lord Beaverbrook</a> and the Federation of British Industries.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Churchill_5.jpg" title="fig:Churchill as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1927" alt="Churchill as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1927" /> Churchill later regarded this as the greatest mistake of his life; he stated he was not an economist and that he acted on the advice of the Governor of the <a href="Bank_of_England" title="wikilink">Bank of England</a>, <a href="Montagu_Norman" title="wikilink">Montagu Norman</a>. However in discussions at the time with former Chancellor <a href="McKenna" class="uri" title="wikilink">McKenna</a>, Churchill acknowledged that the return to the gold standard and the resulting 'dear money' policy was economically bad. In those discussions he maintained the policy as fundamentally political - a return to the pre war conditions in which he believed.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> In his speech on the Bill he said &quot;I will tell you what it (the return to the Gold Standard) will shackle us to. It will shackle us to reality.&quot;</p>
<p>It was not only the return to the <a href="Gold_Standard" title="wikilink">Gold Standard</a> that later economists, as well as people at the time, criticised in Churchill's time at the <a href="HM_Treasury" title="wikilink">Treasury</a>. Rather it was his <a href="United_Kingdom_budget" title="wikilink">budget</a> measures which, even given the consensus at the time that the budgets should be balanced were attacked as assisting the generally prosperous rentier banking and salaried classes (to which Churchill and his associates generally belonged) at the expense of manufacturers and exporters which were known then to be suffering from imports and from competition in traditional export markets.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> However his 1925 budget was well received by the public and enhanced Churchill's prestige within the government.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>The return to the pre-war exchange rate and to the Gold Standard depressed industries. The most affected was the <a href="coal" class="uri" title="wikilink">coal</a> industry. Already suffering from declining output as shipping switched to oil, as basic British industries like cotton came under more competition in export markets, the return to the pre war exchange was estimated to add up to 10% in costs to the industry. In July 1925 a Commission of Inquiry reported generally favouring the <a href="miners" class="uri" title="wikilink">miners</a>, rather than the mine owners' position.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Attached to the report was a memorandum from Sir <a href="Josiah_Stamp" title="wikilink">Josiah Stamp</a> stating that the increased difficulties in the coal industry could be entirely explained by the 'immediate and necessary effects of the return to Gold.'<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>Baldwin, with Churchill's support proposed a subsidy to the industry while a Royal Commission prepared a further report. During the <a href="UK_General_Strike_1926" title="wikilink">General Strike of 1926</a>, Churchill was reported to have suggested that <a href="machine_gun" title="wikilink">machine guns</a> be used on the striking miners. Churchill edited the Government's newspaper, the <em><a href="British_Gazette" title="wikilink">British Gazette</a></em>, and, during the dispute, he argued that &quot;either the country will break the <a href="General_strike" title="wikilink">General Strike</a>, or the General Strike will break the country.&quot; Furthermore, he controversially claimed that the <a href="Fascism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fascism</a> of <a href="Benito_Mussolini" title="wikilink">Benito Mussolini</a> had &quot;rendered a service to the whole world,&quot; showing, as it had, &quot;a way to combat subversive forces&quot; &lt;U+2014&gt; that is, he considered the regime to be a bulwark against the perceived threat of <a href="Communist_revolution" title="wikilink">Communist revolution</a>. At one point, Churchill went as far as to call Mussolini the &quot;Roman genius&lt;U+2026&gt; the greatest lawgiver among men.&quot;<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="political-isolation">Political isolation</h3>
<p>The Conservative government was defeated in the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1929" title="wikilink">1929 General Election</a>. Churchill did not seek election to the Conservative Business Committee, the forerunner to the Shadow Cabinet. Over the next two years, Churchill became estranged from the Conservative leadership over the issues of protective tariffs and <a href="Indian_Independence_Movement" title="wikilink">Indian Home Rule</a>, which he bitterly opposed. He further distanced himself from the party as a whole by his friendships with press barons, financiers and people seen as unsound and by his political views. When <a href="Ramsay_MacDonald" title="wikilink">Ramsay MacDonald</a> formed the <a href="National_Government_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">National Government</a> in 1931, Churchill was not invited to join the <a href="Cabinet_(government)" title="wikilink">Cabinet</a>. He was at the low point in his career, in a period known as &quot;the wilderness years&quot;.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>

He spent much of the next few years concentrating on his writing, including <em><a href="Marlborough:_His_Life_and_Times" title="wikilink">Marlborough: His Life and Times</a></em> &lt;U+2014&gt; a biography of his ancestor <a href="John_Churchill,_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough" title="wikilink">John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; and <em><a href="A_History_of_the_English_Speaking_Peoples" title="wikilink">A History of the English Speaking Peoples</a></em> (though the latter was not published until well after World War II).<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Some historians have shown close parallels between Churchill's views of Marlborough as a war leader advocating firm policies surrounded by politicians and a wider public who attacked both him personally and his policies and Churchill's own stand against appeasement<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> .</p>
<p>Though badly hurt when he was struck by a car in New York City on a North American speaking tour, he wrote a profitable article about the experience. He wrote many other articles, collections of speeches and several books- some such as his <em>Great Contemporaries</em> of lasting worth. He supported himself largely by his writing and was one of the best paid writers of his time.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p>Nevertheless he was still in financial difficulties, having lost most of his American investments in the Wall Street Crash. He was criticised for holidaying in the Rivieria and America as the guest of such people as Beaverbrook,<a href="William_Randolph_Hurst" title="wikilink">William Randolph Hurst</a> and for drinking and gambling with people such as <a href="Brendan_Bracken" title="wikilink">Brendan Bracken</a> (widely rumoured to be Churchill's illegitimate son) and, until his early death <a href="F._E._Smith,_1st_Earl_of_Birkenhead" title="wikilink">Lord Birkenhead</a>. <a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a>. These attacks were not new; in 1922 Churchill had brought a successful libel action against <a href="Lord_Alfred_Douglas" title="wikilink">Lord Alfred Douglas</a> who had accused Churchill of giving a deliberately false account of the <a href="Battle_of_Jutland" title="wikilink">Battle of Jutland</a> at the request of Sir <a href="Ernest_Cassel" title="wikilink">Ernest Cassel</a>. During the trial it emerged Cassel whose company remained Churchill's publisher had paid for some of the furnishinngs of Churchill's London residence.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p>But the fact that Churchill was seen to associate with press barons (who in the case of Rothermere and Beaverbrook campaigned against the Conservative leadership and some Conservative policies), financiers (such as Cassel whom <a href="Lord_Salisbury" title="wikilink">Lord Salisbury</a> had refused to recommend for a peerage <a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> and people said to be of dubious character (such as Birkenhead)<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> hurt his career. Historians have referred to a &lt;U+201C&gt;whispering campaign&lt;U+2019&gt; of innuendo based partly on Churchill&lt;U+2019&gt;s associations brought by the Conservative Central Office during this period <a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a>.</p>
<p>His <a href="Ideology" title="wikilink">political views</a>, set forth in his 1930 Romanes Election and published as <em>Parliamentary Government and the Economic Problem</em> (OUP) (republished in 1932 in his collection of essays &quot;Thoughts and Adventures&quot;) (in America under the title Amid These Storms) involved abandoning <a href="universal_suffrage" title="wikilink">universal suffrage</a>, a return to a property franchise, <a href="proportional_representation" title="wikilink">proportional representation</a> for the major cities and an economic 'sub parliament'.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="indian-independence">Indian Independence</h4>

<p>During the first half of the 1930s, outspoken opposition towards the granting of <a href="Dominion" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dominion</a> status to India became one of Churchill's major political focuses. Churchill was one of the founders of the India Defence League, a group dedicated to the preservation of British power in India. In speeches and press articles in this period he forecast widespread British unemployment and civil strife in India should independence be granted to India.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> The Viceroy <a href="Lord_Irwin" title="wikilink">Lord Irwin</a> who had been appointed by the prior Conservative Government engaged in the <a href="Round_Table_Conference" title="wikilink">Round Table Conference</a> in early 1931 and then announced the Government's policy that India should be granted Dominion Status. In this the Government was supported by the Liberal Party and, officially at least, by the Conservative Party. <img src="Gandhi_studio_1931.jpg" title="fig:Though he would later come to respect Mohandas Gandhi (pictured), Churchill opposed him and the Indian Independence movement in the 1930s, arguing that the Round Table Conference &quot;was a frightful prospect&quot;." alt="Though he would later come to respect Mohandas Gandhi (pictured), Churchill opposed him and the Indian Independence movement in the 1930s, arguing that the Round Table Conference &quot;was a frightful prospect&quot;." /></p>
<p>This support as Churchill later wrote &quot;brought about my breaking point with Mr Baldwin&quot;.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Churchill denounced the Round Table Conference. He spoke at public meetings in Manchester and Liverpool in January and February 1931 respectively. At both he forecast widespread unemployment into the millions and other social and economic problems in England if India became self governing.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> Though he would come to respect <a href="Mohandas_Gandhi" title="wikilink">Mohandas Gandhi</a>, especially after Gandhi &quot;stood up for the untouchables&quot;,<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> at a meeting of the West <a href="Essex" class="uri" title="wikilink">Essex</a> Conservative Association specially convened so Churchill could explain his position he said , &quot;It is alarming and also nauseating to see Mr Gandhi, a seditious Middle-Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well-known in the East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal palace...to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor.&quot;<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> He called the Congress leaders &quot;Brahmims who mouth and patter principles of Western Liberalism.&quot;<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>
<p>In Parliament on 26th January 1931 he attacked the Government's policy saying that the Round Table Conference &quot;was a frightful prospect&quot; and that he would support &quot;effective and real organisms of provisional and local government in the provinces.&quot;<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> He returned to the Parliamentary attack on 13th March. Baldwin answered him by quoting Churchill's own speech in winding up the debate for the Lloyd George Coalition government on <a href="Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre" title="wikilink">Amritsar massacre</a> in which Churchill defended the cashiering of General <a href="Reginald_Dyer" title="wikilink">Reginald Dyer</a>. Baldwin continued by challenging Churchill and his other critics to depose him as leader of the Conservative Party.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>There were two incidents which damaged Churchill's reputation greatly within the Conservative Party in the period.</p>
<p>The first was his speech on the eve of the <a href="Westminster_St_George&#39;s_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">St George by-election</a> in April 1931. In a secure Conservative seat, the official Conservative candidate <a href="Duff_Cooper" title="wikilink">Duff Cooper</a> was opposed by an independent Conservative. The independent was supported by <a href="Harold_Harmsworth,_1st_Viscount_Rothermere" title="wikilink">Lord Rothermere</a>, Lord Beaverbrook and their respective newspapers. Both <a href="press_baron" title="wikilink">press barons</a> had tried to urge specific policies on the Conservative Partyâ€”Rothermere opposed Indian home rule, Beaverbrook pressed for <a href="Tariff_Reform" title="wikilink">Tariff Reform</a> under the slogan Empire Free Trade. Churchill's speech at the <a href="Albert_Hall" title="wikilink">Albert Hall</a> had been arranged before the date of the by election had been set.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> But he made no attempt to change the date and his speech was seen as a part of the Press Baron's campaign against Baldwin. This was reinforced by Churchill's personal friendship with both but especially with Beaverbrook who wrote &quot;The primary issue of the by-election will be the leadership of the Conservative Party. If..(the independent candidate wins) Baldwin must go&quot;.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> Baldwin's position was strengthened when Duff Cooper won and when the civil disobedience campaign in India ceased with the <a href="Gandhi-Irwin_Pact" title="wikilink">Gandhi-Irwin Pact</a></p>
<p>The second issue also affected his reputation within the Parliament as a whole and the nation at large. On 16th April 1934 Churchill claimed in Parliament that Sir <a href="Samuel_Hoare" title="wikilink">Samuel Hoare</a> and <a href="Edward_George_Villiers_Stanley,_17th_Earl_of_Derby" title="wikilink">Lord Derby</a> had pressured the Manchester Chamber of Commerce to change evidence it had given to the Joint Select Committee considering the Government of India Bill in June 1933. On 18th April he successfully moved the matter be referred to the House of Commons Privilege Committee. He tried to cross examine witnesses before the Committee, contrary to the Committee's normal procedure. Churchill himself gave evidence and <a href="Austen_Chamberlain" title="wikilink">Austen Chamberlain</a> criticised the manner in which he gave it. Churchill's evidence was meagre and the inquiry reported to the House that there had been no breach. The report was debated on 13th June. Churchill was unable to find a single supporter in the House and the debate ended without a division. <a href="Leo_Amery" title="wikilink">Leo Amery</a> accused him of pressing the matter to bring the government down <em>at all costs he had to be faithful to his chosen motto:'Fiat justicia, ruat caelum</em></p>
<p><em>CHURCHILL translate it</em></p>
<p><em>AMERY I will translate it into the venacular &quot;If I can trip up Sam [Hoare] the government's bust</em>.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Churchill's break with Baldwin was permanent. He never held any office while Baldwin was in Parliament. In 1947 Churchill said &quot;I wish Stanley Baldwin no ill, but it would have been much better had he never lived.&quot; In the index to the <em>Gathering Storm</em>, Churchill's first volume of his History of World War Two, he records Baldwin &quot;admitting to putting party before country&quot; for his alleged admission that he would not have won the 1935 Election if he had pursued a more aggressive policy of rearmament. Churchill selectively quotes a speech in the Commons by Baldwin and gives the false impression that Baldwin is speaking of the general election when he was speaking of a by election in 1933 and omits altogether Baldwin's actual comments about the 1935 election &quot;we got from the country, a mandate for doing a thing [a substantial rearmament programme] that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible&quot;.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> This canard had been first put forward in the first edition of <a href="Guilty_Men" title="wikilink">Guilty Men</a> but in subsequent editions (including those before Churchill wrote the Gathering Storm) had been corrected.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>
<p>Churchill continued his campaign against any further transfer of power to Indians. He continued to predict bloodshed in India and mass unemployment at home. His speeches often quoted nineteenth century politicians and his own policy was to maintain the existing Raj.</p>
<p>Some historians see his basic attitude to India as being set out in his <em>My Early Life</em> which was published in 1930.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a>. Historians also dispute his motives in maintaining his opposition. Some see him as trying to destabilise the National Government. In this they follow Amery (see above) and Lloyd George who believed that with MacDonald ill and Churchill leading the Conservative right wing Baldwin would have to form a new Coalition in which both he and Churchill would have key ministries. <a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Some historians also draw a parallel between his attitudes to India and those towards the Nazis.For example Manfred Weidhorn in the introduction to the American edition of <em>India</em> (a collection of Churchill&lt;U+2019&gt;s speeches on the topic) writes. &quot;... Machiavelli sheds light on Churchill. The Italian notes that virtues and vices are often symbiotic rather than antithetical. Thus people say, 'Hannibal was a great general - too bad he was cruel', when the likelihood is that Hannibal was great in part because he was cruel. So here we have to consider the probability that Churchill was great in 1940 in part because he was too pugnacious, stubborn, deluded, and conservative (in the deepest sense) to be able to adjust to the New Order in Europe - traits he had shown in the matter of India&quot;. <a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="german-rearmament">German Rearmament</h4>
<p>Beginning in 1932 when he opposed those who advocated giving Germany the right to military parity with France, Churchill spoke often of the dangers of Germany's rearmament.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> He later, particularly in <em>The Gathering Storm</em>, tried to portray himself as being for a time, a lone voice calling on Britain to strengthen itself to counter the belligerence of Germany.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> However <a href="George_Ambrose_Lloyd,_1st_Baron_Lloyd" title="wikilink">Lord Lloyd</a> was the first to so agitate.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
<p>Churchill's attitude toward the Fascist dictators was ambiguous. In 1931 he warned against the League of Nations opposing the Japanese in Manchuria &quot;I hope we shall try in England to understand the position of Japan an ancient state...On the one side they have the dark menace of Soviet Russia. On the other the chaos of China four or five provinces of which are being tortured under Communist rule&quot;.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> In contemporary newspaper articles he referred to the Spanish Republican government as a communist front, and Franco's army as the &quot;Anti red movement'.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> He supported the <a href="Hoare-Laval_Pact" title="wikilink">Hoare-Laval Pact</a> and continued up until 1937 to praise Mussolini.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> In his 1937 book &quot;Great Contemporaries&quot;, Churchill wrote: &quot;One may dislike Hitler's system and yet admire his patriotic achievements. If our country were defeated, I hope we should find a champion as admirable (as <a href="Hitler" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hitler</a>) to restore our courage and lead us back to our place among the nations&quot;. Speaking in the House of Commons, in 1937, he said &quot;I will not pretend that, if I had to choose between communism and Nazism, I would choose communism&quot;. In the same work, Churchill expressed a hope that despite Hitler's apparent dictatorial tendencies, he would use his power to rebuild Germany into a worthy member of the world community.</p>
<p>Churchill's first major speech on defence on 7th February 1934 stressed the need to rebuild the Royal Air Force and to create a Ministry of Defence, his second, on 13th July urged a renewed role for the League of Nations. These three topics remained his themes till early 1936. In 1935 he was one of the founding members of &quot;Focus&quot; a group which also included Sir Archibald Sinclair, Lady <a href="Violet_Bonham_Carter,_Baroness_Asquith_of_Yarnbury" title="wikilink">Violet Bonham Carter</a>, <a href="Wickham_Steed" title="wikilink">Wickham Steed</a> and Professor <a href="Gilbert_Murray" title="wikilink">Gilbert Murray</a>. Focus brought together people of differing political backgrounds and occupations who were united in seeking 'the defence of freedom and peace'.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> Focus led to the formation of the much wider Arms and the Covenant Movement in 1936.</p>
<p>Churchill was holidaying in Spain when the <a href="Remilitarization_of_the_Rhineland" title="wikilink">Germans reoccupied the Rhineland</a> in February of that year and returned to a divided England where the Labour opposition was adamant in opposing sanctions and the National Government divided between advocates of economic sanctions and those who said that even these would lead to a humiliating backdown by Britain as France would not support any intervention.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> Churchill's speech on 9th March was measured and praised by <a href="Neville_Chamberlain" title="wikilink">Neville Chamberlain</a> as constructive. But within weeks Churchill was passed over for the post of <a href="Minister_for_Co-ordination_of_Defence" title="wikilink">Minister for Co-ordination of Defence</a> in favour of the Attorney General Sir <a href="Thomas_Inskip" title="wikilink">Thomas Inskip</a>.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a></p>
<p>This surprising appointment- it surprised Inskip as much as anyone - came despite advice to Baldwin to broaden his cabinet. Historians have variously seen it as Baldwin's caution in not wanting to appoint someone as controversial as Churchill, as avoiding giving Germany any sign that the United Kingdom was preparing for war and as avoiding someone who had few allies in the Conservative Party and was opposed as a war monger by many people in England.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> Whatever the reason it was a severe blow to Churchill.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a></p>
<p>In June 1936 he organised a deputation of senior Conservatives who shared his concern to see Baldwin, Chamberlain and Halifax. He had tried to have delegates from the other two parties and later wrote &quot;If the leaders of the Labour and Liberal oppositions had come with us there might have been a political situation so intense as to enforce remedial action.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> As it was the meeting achieved little, Baldwin arguing that the Government was doing all it could given the anti war feeling of the electorate.

<p><img src="King_Edward_VIII._(1936).jpg" title="fig:The response of Churchill in the Abdication Crisis of King Edward VIII (pictured) caused severe damage to Churchill&#39;s political reputation." alt="The response of Churchill in the Abdication Crisis of King Edward VIII (pictured) caused severe damage to Churchill&#39;s political reputation." /> In June 1936 <a href="Walter_Monckton" title="wikilink">Walter Monckton</a> told Churchill that the rumours that King <a href="Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Edward VIII</a> intended to marry Mrs <a href="Wallis_Simpson" title="wikilink">Wallis Simpson</a> were true. Churchill then advised against the marriage and said he regarded Mrs Simpson's existing marriage as a 'safeguard'.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> In November he declined <a href="Lord_Salisbury" title="wikilink">Lord Salisbury</a>'s invitation to be part of a delegation of senior Conservative backbenchers which met with Baldwin to discuss the matter. On 25th November he, <a href="Atlee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Atlee</a> and Sinclair met with Baldwin and were told officially of the King's intention and asked whether they would form an administration if Baldwin and the National Government resigned should the King not take the Ministry's advice. Both Atlee and Sinclair said they would not take office if invited to do so. Churchill's reply was that his attitude was a little different but he would support the government.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>
<p>At the time Churchill was seen as an alternative leader. As Lord Beaverbrook wrote &quot;he has emerged as a leader of a big armaments anti-German movement in politics, hostile to the Government&quot;.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
<p>The Abdication crisis became public, coming to head in the fist fornight of December 1936. At this time Churchill publicly gave his support to the King. The first public meeting of the Arms and the Covenant Movement was on 3rd December. Churchill was a major speaker and later wrote that in replying to the Vote of Thanks he made a declaration 'on the spur of the moment' asking for delay before any decision was made by either the King or his Cabinet.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> Later that night Churchill saw the draft of the King's proposed wireless broadcast and spoke with Beaverbrook and the King's solicitor about it.</p>
<p>On 4th December he met with the King and again urged delay. On 5th December he issued a lengthy statement implying that the Ministry was applying unconstitutional pressure on the King to force him to make a hasty decision.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> On 7th December he tried to address the Commons to plead for delay. He was shouted down. Seemingly staggered by the unanimous hostility of all Members he left.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>
<p>Churchill's reputation in Parliament and England as a whole was badly damaged. Some such as <a href="Alistair_Cooke" title="wikilink">Alistair Cooke</a> saw him as trying to build a King's Party.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> Others like <a href="Harold_Macmillan" title="wikilink">Harold Macmillan</a> were dismayed by the damage Churchill's support for the King had done to the Arms and the Covenant Movement.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> Churchill himself later wrote &quot;I was myself smitten in public opinion that it was the almost universal view that my political life was ended.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
<p>Historians are divided about Churchill's motives in his support for Edward VIII. Some such as <a href="A_J_P_Taylor" title="wikilink">A J P Taylor</a> see it as being an attempt to 'overthrow the government of feeble men'.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> Others such as Rhode James see Churchill's motives as entirely honourable and disinterested, that he felt deeply for the King.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="return-from-exile">Return from Exile</h3>
<p>Churchill later sought to portray himself as an isolated voice. While it is true that he had little following in the House of Commons during much of the 1930s he was given considerable privileges by the Government. The &lt;U+201C&gt;Churchill group&lt;U+201D&gt; in the later half of the decade consisted only of himself, <a href="Duncan_Sandys" title="wikilink">Duncan Sandys</a> and <a href="Brendan_Bracken" title="wikilink">Brendan Bracken</a>. It was isolated from the other main factions within the Conservative Party pressing for faster rearmament and a stronger foreign policy.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<p>In some senses the &lt;U+2018&gt;exile&lt;U+2019&gt; was more apparent then real. Churchill continued to be consulted on many matters by the Government or seen as an alternative leader <a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a>. More importantly however <a href="Lord_Swinton" title="wikilink">Lord Swinton</a> as Secretary of State for Air, and with Baldwin&lt;U+2019&gt;s approval gave Churchill access to official and otherwise secret information. Swinton did so, knowing Churchill would remain a critic of the government but believing that an informed critic was better then one relying on rumour and hearsay.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>
<p>Churchill was a fierce critic of <a href="Neville_Chamberlain" title="wikilink">Neville Chamberlain</a>'s <a href="appeasement" class="uri" title="wikilink">appeasement</a> of Hitler, leading the wing of the Conservative Party that opposed the <a href="Munich_Agreement" title="wikilink">Munich Agreement</a> which Chamberlain famously declared to mean &quot;peace in our time&quot;.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> In a speech to the House of Commons, he bluntly (and prophetically) stated, &quot;You were given the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, and you will have war.&quot;<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="role-as-wartime-prime-minister">Role as wartime Prime Minister</h2>
<h3 id="winston-is-back">&quot;Winston is back&quot;</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> Churchill was appointed <a href="First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty" title="wikilink">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> and a member of the War Cabinet, just as he was in the first part of the <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>. The Navy, according to myth, sent out the signal: &quot;Winston is back.&quot;<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a></p>
<p>In this job, he proved to be one of the highest-profile ministers during the so-called &quot;<a href="Phony_War" title="wikilink">Phony War</a>&quot;, when the only noticeable action was at sea. Churchill advocated the pre-emptive occupation of the neutral Norwegian <a href="Iron_ore" title="wikilink">iron-ore</a> port of <a href="Narvik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Narvik</a> and the iron mines in <a href="Swedish_iron_ore_during_World_War_II" title="wikilink">Kiruna</a>, <a href="Sweden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sweden</a>, early in the War. However, Chamberlain and the rest of the <a href="War_Cabinet" title="wikilink">War Cabinet</a> disagreed, and the operation was delayed until the successful <a href="Norwegian_campaign" title="wikilink">German invasion of Norway</a>.</p>
<h3 id="bitter-beginnings-of-the-war">Bitter beginnings of the war</h3>
<p><img src="Wc0107-04780r.jpg" title="fig:Churchill wears a helmet during an air raid warning in the Battle for Britain in 1940" alt="Churchill wears a helmet during an air raid warning in the Battle for Britain in 1940" /> On <a href="10_May" title="wikilink">10 May</a> <a href="1940" class="uri" title="wikilink">1940</a>, hours before the German invasion of France by a <a href="Blitzkrieg" title="wikilink">lightning advance</a> through the <a href="Low_Countries" title="wikilink">Low Countries</a>, it became clear that, following failure in Norway, the country had no confidence in Chamberlain's prosecution of the war and so Chamberlain resigned. The commonly accepted version of events states that <a href="E._F._L._Wood,_1st_Earl_of_Halifax" title="wikilink">Lord Halifax</a> turned down the post of Prime Minister because he believed he could not govern effectively as a member of the <a href="House_of_Lords" title="wikilink">House of Lords</a> instead of the <a href="British_House_of_Commons" title="wikilink">House of Commons</a>. Although traditionally, the Prime Minister does not advise the King on the former's successor, Chamberlain wanted someone who would command the support of all three major parties in the House of Commons. A meeting between Chamberlain, Halifax, Churchill and <a href="David_Margesson,_1st_Viscount_Margesson" title="wikilink">David Margesson</a>, the government <a href="Chief_Whip" title="wikilink">Chief Whip</a>, led to the recommendation of Churchill, and, as a constitutional monarch, <a href="George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">George VI</a> asked Churchill to be Prime Minister and to form an all-party government. Churchill's first act was to write to Chamberlain to thank him for his support.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a></p>
<p>Churchill's greatest achievement was his refusal to capitulate when defeat seemed imminent, and he remained a strong opponent of any negotiations with <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a> throughout the war. Few others in the Cabinet had this degree of resolve. Although there was an element of British public and political sentiment favouring negotiated peace with a clearly ascendant Germany, among them the <a href="Foreign_Secretary" title="wikilink">Foreign Secretary</a> <a href="E._F._L._Wood,_1st_Earl_of_Halifax" title="wikilink">Lord Halifax</a>, Churchill nonetheless refused to consider an armistice with Hitler's Germany.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> Churchill's skillful use of <a href="rhetoric" class="uri" title="wikilink">rhetoric</a> hardened <a href="public_opinion" title="wikilink">public opinion</a> against a peaceful resolution and prepared the British for a long war.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> Coining the general term for the upcoming battle, Churchill stated in his <a href="This_was_their_finest_hour" title="wikilink">&quot;finest hour&quot;</a> speech to the <a href="British_House_of_Commons" title="wikilink">House of Commons</a> on <a href="18_June" title="wikilink">18 June</a> <a href="1940" class="uri" title="wikilink">1940</a>, &quot;I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin.&quot;<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> By refusing an armstice with Germany, Churchill kept resistance alive in the <a href="British_Empire" title="wikilink">British Empire</a> and created the basis for the later <a href="Allies_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">Allied counter-attacks</a> of 1942-45, with Britain serving as a platform for the supply of <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> and the liberation of <a href="Western_Europe" title="wikilink">Western Europe</a>. <img src="Wc0106-3a18421r.jpg" title="fig:Winston Churchill walks through the ruins of Coventry Cathedral, 1942" alt="Winston Churchill walks through the ruins of Coventry Cathedral, 1942" /></p>
<p>In response to previous criticisms that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of the war, Churchill created and took the additional position of <a href="Minister_of_Defence_(UK)" title="wikilink">Minister of Defence</a>. He immediately put his friend and confidant, the industrialist and newspaper baron <a href="Max_Aitken,_1st_Baron_Beaverbrook" title="wikilink">Lord Beaverbrook</a>, in charge of aircraft production. It was Beaverbrook's business acumen that allowed Britain to quickly gear up aircraft production and engineering that eventually made the difference in the war.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
<p>Churchill's speeches were a great inspiration to the embattled British. His first speech as Prime Minister was the famous &quot;<em>I have nothing to offer but <a href="blood,_toil,_tears,_and_sweat" title="wikilink">blood, toil, tears, and sweat</a></em>&quot;. He followed that closely with two other equally famous ones, given just before the <a href="Battle_of_Britain" title="wikilink">Battle of Britain</a>. One included the immortal words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, <a href="we_shall_fight_on_the_beaches" title="wikilink">we shall fight on the beaches</a>, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other included the equally famous:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves, that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, '<a href="This_was_their_finest_hour" title="wikilink">This was their finest hour</a>'.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="Brooke_-_Churchill_-_Montgomery.jpg" title="fig:Churchill with Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and Field Marshal Alan Brooke, 1944" alt="Churchill with Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and Field Marshal Alan Brooke, 1944" /> At the height of the Battle of Britain, his bracing survey of the situation included the memorable line &quot;<em>Never in the field of human conflict was <a href="so_much_owed_by_so_many_to_so_few" title="wikilink">so much owed by so many to so few</a></em>&quot;, which engendered the enduring nickname &quot;<a href="The_Few" title="wikilink">The Few</a>&quot; for the Allied fighter pilots who won it.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> One of his most memorable war speeches came on <a href="10_November" title="wikilink">10 November</a> <a href="1942" class="uri" title="wikilink">1942</a> at the Lord Mayor's Luncheon at <a href="Mansion_House" title="wikilink">Mansion House</a> in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, in response to the Allied victory at the <a href="Second_Battle_of_El_Alamein" title="wikilink">Second Battle of El Alamein</a>.

</blockquote>
<p>Without having much in the way of sustenance or good news to offer the <a href="Briton" title="wikilink">British people</a>, he took a <a href="political_risk" title="wikilink">political risk</a> in deliberately choosing to emphasise the dangers instead.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Rhetorical power,</em>&quot; wrote Churchill, &quot;<em>is neither wholly bestowed, nor wholly acquired, but cultivated.</em>&quot; Not all were impressed by his oratory. Robert Menzies, who was the Prime Minister of Australia, said during World War II of Churchill: &quot;His real tyrant is the glittering phrase so attractive to his mind that awkward facts have to give way.&quot;<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> Another associate wrote: &quot;He is . . . the slave of the words which his mind forms about ideas. . . .

Roosevelt, and Churchill at the Cairo Conference in 1943" /> His good relationship with <a href="Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> secured vital food, oil and munitions via the <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">North Atlantic</a> shipping routes. It was for this reason that Churchill was relieved when Roosevelt was <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1940" title="wikilink">re-elected in 1940</a>. Upon re-election, Roosevelt immediately set about implementing a new method of providing military hardware and shipping to Britain without the need for monetary payment. Put simply, Roosevelt persuaded Congress that repayment for this immensely costly service would take the form of defending the USA; and so <a href="Lend-lease" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lend-lease</a> was born. Churchill had 12 strategic <a href="List_of_World_War_II_conferences" title="wikilink">conferences</a> with Roosevelt which covered the <a href="Atlantic_Charter" title="wikilink">Atlantic Charter</a>, <a href="Europe_first" title="wikilink">Europe first</a> strategy, the <a href="Declaration_by_the_United_Nations" title="wikilink">Declaration by the United Nations</a> and other war policies. <img src="Churchill-in-quebec-1944-23-0201a.gif" title="fig:Winston Churchill at the Quebec conference" alt="Winston Churchill at the Quebec conference" /> After <a href="Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" title="wikilink">Pearl Harbor was attacked</a>, Churchill's first thought in anticipation of U.S. help was, &quot;We have won the war!&quot;,<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> Then <a href="26_December" title="wikilink">26 December</a> <a href="1941" class="uri" title="wikilink">1941</a> Churchill addressed a joint meeting of the <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">U.S. Congress</a>, asking of Germany and Japan, &quot;What kind of people do they think we are?&quot;.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> Churchill initiated the <a href="Special_Operations_Executive" title="wikilink">Special Operations Executive</a> (SOE) under <a href="Hugh_Dalton" title="wikilink">Hugh Dalton</a>'s <a href="Minister_of_Economic_Warfare" title="wikilink">Ministry of Economic Warfare</a>, which established, conducted and fostered covert, subversive and partisan operations in <a href="occupied_territories" title="wikilink">occupied territories</a> with notable success; and also the <a href="British_Commandos" title="wikilink">Commandos</a> which established the pattern for most of the world's current <a href="Special_Forces" title="wikilink">Special Forces</a>. The Russians referred to him as the &quot;British Bulldog&quot;.</p>
<p>Churchill's health was fragile, as shown by a mild <a href="Myocardial_infarction" title="wikilink">heart attack</a> he suffered in December 1941 at the White House and also in December 1943 when he contracted pneumonia. Despite this, he travelled over  throughout the war to meet other national leaders. For security, he usually travelled using the alias Colonel Warden.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> <img src="Wc0196.jpg" title="fig:Churchill on his visit to America addresses a joint session of the United States Congress, 1943" alt="Churchill on his visit to America addresses a joint session of the United States Congress, 1943" /> Churchill was party to treaties that would redraw post-World War II European and Asian boundaries. These were discussed as early as 1943. Proposals for European boundaries and settlements were officially agreed to by <a href="Harry_S_Truman" title="wikilink">Harry S Truman</a>, Churchill, and <a href="Stalin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stalin</a> at <a href="Potsdam_Conference" title="wikilink">Potsdam</a>.

Soon, British supplies and tanks were flowing to help the Soviet Union.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a></p>
<p>The settlement concerning the borders of Poland, that is, the <a href="Curzon_line" title="wikilink">boundary between Poland and the Soviet Union</a> and <a href="Oder-Neisse_line" title="wikilink">between Germany and Poland</a>, was viewed as a betrayal in Poland during the post-war years, as it was established against the views of the <a href="Polish_government_in_exile" title="wikilink">Polish government in exile</a>. It was Winston Churchill, who tried to motivate <a href="Stanis&lt;U+0142&gt;aw_Miko&lt;U+0142&gt;ajczyk" title="wikilink">Miko&lt;U+0142&gt;ajczyk</a>, who was Prime Minister of the Polish government in exile, to accept Stalin's wishes, but Miko&lt;U+0142&gt;ajczyk refused. Churchill was convinced that the only way to alleviate tensions between the two populations was the transfer of people, to match the national borders. As he expounded in the House of Commons on <a href="15_December" title="wikilink">15 December</a> 1944, &quot;Expulsion is the method which, insofar as we have been able to see, will be the most satisfactory and lasting.

Churchill opposed the effective annexation of Poland by the Soviet Union and wrote bitterly about it in his books, but he was unable to prevent it at the conferences. <img src="ChurchillandInonu.jpg" title="fig:Churchill secretly meets with President Ismet In&lt;U+00F6&gt;n&lt;U+00FC&gt; at the Yenice Station  outside of Adana in south-east Turkey, on January 30, 1943" alt="Churchill secretly meets with President Ismet In&lt;U+00F6&gt;n&lt;U+00FC&gt; at the Yenice Station  outside of Adana in south-east Turkey, on January 30, 1943" /> During October 1944, he and Eden were in <a href="Moscow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moscow</a> to meet with the Russian leadership. At this point, Russian forces were beginning to advance into various eastern European countries. Churchill held the view that until everything was formally and properly worked out at Yalta, there had to be a temporary, war-time, working agreement with regard to who would run what. Churchill suggested that Stalin had an 90 percent interest in <a href="Romania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romania</a>, Britain an 90 percent interest in <a href="Greece" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greece</a>, both <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a> and Britain a 50 percent interest in <a href="Yugoslavia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yugoslavia</a> and <a href="Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungary</a> and in <a href="Bulgaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a>, a 75% Russian interest.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> Stalin agreed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it has also been asserted that Churchills involvement in the bombing of Dresden was based on the strategic and tactical aspects of winning the war. The destruction of Dresden, whilst horrific, was designed to expedite the defeat of <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a>. As the historian <a href="Max_Hastings" title="wikilink">Max Hastings</a> said in an article subtitled, 'the Allied Bombing of Dresden': &quot;I believe it is wrong to describe strategic bombing as a war crime, for this might be held to suggest some moral equivalence with the deeds of the Nazis. Bombing represented a sincere, albeit mistaken, attempt to bring about Germany's military defeat.&quot; Furthermore British historian, <a href="Frederick_Taylor_(historian)" title="wikilink">Frederick Taylor</a> asserts that &quot;All sides bombed each other's cities during the war. Half a million Soviet citizens, for example, died from German bombing during the invasion and occupation of Russia. That's roughly equivalent to the number of German citizens who died from Allied raids. But the Allied bombing campaign was attached to military operations and ceased as soon as military operations ceased.&quot;<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="after-world-war-ii">After World War II</h2>
<p>Although Churchill's role in World War II had generated him much support from the British population, he had many opponents. He also expressed contempt for a number of popular ideas, in particular creating a system of national <a href="Publicly-funded_health_care" title="wikilink">public health care</a> and improving <a href="public_education" title="wikilink">public education</a>. Partly as a result of this Churchill was defeated in <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1945" title="wikilink">the 1945 election</a> by <a href="Clement_Attlee" title="wikilink">Clement Attlee</a> and the <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour Party</a>.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> Some historians think that many British voters believed that the man who had led the nation so well in war was not the best man to lead it in peace. Others see the election result as a reaction not against Churchill personally, but against the Conservative Party's record in the 1930s under Baldwin and Chamberlain. During the opening broadcast of the <a href="Political_campaign" title="wikilink">election campaign</a>, Churchill astonished many of his admirers by warning that a Labour government would introduce into Britain &quot;some form of Gestapo, no doubt humanely administered in the first instance&quot;. Churchill had been genuinely worried during the war by the inroads of state bureaucracy into <a href="Civil_liberties" title="wikilink">civil liberty</a>, and was clearly influenced by <a href="Friedrich_Hayek" title="wikilink">Friedrich Hayek</a>'s anti-totalitarian tract, <em><a href="The_Road_to_Serfdom" title="wikilink">The Road to Serfdom</a></em> (1944).</p>
<p>Winston Churchill was an early supporter of the <a href="pan-Europeanism" class="uri" title="wikilink">pan-Europeanism</a>. In his famous speech at the <a href="University_of_Zurich" title="wikilink">University of Zurich</a> in 1946, Winston Churchill called for a &quot;United States of Europe&quot; and the creation of a &quot;Council of Europe&quot;. He also participated in the <a href="Hague_Congress" title="wikilink">Hague Congress</a> of 1948, which discussed the future structure and role of this Council of Europe. The <a href="Council_of_Europe" title="wikilink">Council of Europe</a> was finally founded as the first European institution through the <a href="Treaty_of_London_(1949)" title="wikilink">Treaty of London</a> of <a href="5_May" title="wikilink">5 May</a> <a href="1949" class="uri" title="wikilink">1949</a> and has its seat in <a href="Strasbourg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Strasbourg</a>.</p>
<p><img src="Wc0256s.jpg" title="fig:Churchill on the campus grounds of Westminster College with President Harry Truman in 1946" alt="Churchill on the campus grounds of Westminster College with President Harry Truman in 1946" /> However, this is often seen as his supporting Britain's membership in a <a href="United_States_of_Europe" title="wikilink">united Europe</a>, which is far from the truth. Rather, he saw Pan <a href="Europeanism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europeanism</a> as a Franco-German project which would foster cooperation amongst European countries and the rest of the world and prevent war on the European continent. This can be seen in Churchill&lt;U+2019&gt;s landmark refusal to join the <a href="European_Coal_and_Steel_Community" title="wikilink">European Coal and Steel Community</a> (ECSC) in 1951 as well as his often quoted speech in which he said of Britain's role with Europe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We have our own dream and our own task. We are with Europe, but not of it. We are linked but not combined. We are interested and associated but not absorbed.</em><a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This stance has, arguably, shaped Britain's feelings toward <a href="European_integration" title="wikilink">European integration</a> and its subsequent general ambivalence towards all things Europe. He saw Britain's place as separate from the continent, much more in-line with the countries of the Commonwealth and the Empire and with the United States, the so-called <a href="Anglosphere" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglosphere</a>. As evidenced in his speech at <a href="Westminster_College,_Missouri" title="wikilink">Westminster College</a> in <a href="Fulton,_Missouri" title="wikilink">Fulton</a>, <a href="Missouri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Missouri</a>, given on <a href="5_March" title="wikilink">5 March</a> <a href="1946" class="uri" title="wikilink">1946</a> where as a guest of <a href="Harry_S._Truman" title="wikilink">Harry S. Truman</a>, he declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Neither the sure prevention of war, nor the continuous rise of world organisation will be gained without what I have called the fraternal association of the English-speaking peoples. This means a special relationship between the British Commonwealth and Empire and the United States.</em><a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was also during this speech that he famously popularised the term &quot;The <a href="Iron_Curtain" title="wikilink">Iron Curtain</a>&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>From <a href="Stettin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stettin</a> in the Baltic to <a href="Trieste" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trieste</a> in the Adriatic, an Iron Curtain has descended across the continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and <a href="Eastern_Europe" title="wikilink">Eastern Europe</a>. <a href="Warsaw,_Poland" title="wikilink">Warsaw</a>, <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a>, <a href="Prague" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prague</a>, <a href="Vienna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vienna</a>, <a href="Budapest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Budapest</a>, <a href="Belgrade" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgrade</a>, <a href="Bucharest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bucharest</a> and <a href="Sofia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sofia</a>, all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere.</em><a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a></p>

<p>Churchill was instrumental in giving France a permanent seat on the <a href="UN_Security_Council" title="wikilink">United Nations Security Council</a> (which provided another European power to counterbalance the Soviet Union's permanent seat).</p>

His third governmentâ€”after the wartime national government and the brief caretaker government of 1945 â€” would last until his resignation in 1955. During this period, he renewed what he called the &quot;<a href="special_relationship" title="wikilink">special relationship</a>&quot; between Britain and the United States, and engaged himself in the formation of the post-war order. On racial questions, Churchill was still a late Victorian. He tried in vain to manoeuvre the cabinet into restricting <a href="West_Indies" title="wikilink">West Indian</a> immigration. &quot;Keep England White&quot; was a good slogan, he told the cabinet in January 1955.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> <a href="Ian_Gilmour" title="wikilink">Ian Gilmour</a> records Churchill saying to him, in 1955, about immigration: &quot;I think it is the most important subject facing this country, but I cannot get any of my ministers to take any notice&quot;.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a></p>
<p>His domestic priorities were, however, overshadowed by a series of foreign policy crises, which were partly the result of the continued decline of British military and imperial prestige and power. Being a strong proponent of Britain as an <a href="Power_in_international_relations" title="wikilink">international power</a>, Churchill would often meet such moments with <a href="direct_action" title="wikilink">direct action</a>. Trying to retain what he could of the Empire, he once stated that, &quot;I will not preside over a dismemberment.&quot;<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> Churchill devoted much of his time in office to international relations and although Churchill did not get on well with President <a href="Eisenhower" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eisenhower</a>, Churchill attempted to maintain the<em>special relationship</em> with the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> and he made four official <a href="transatlantic" class="uri" title="wikilink">transatlantic</a> visits to America during his second term as Prime-Minister.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-mau-mau-rebellion">The Mau Mau Rebellion</h3>

<p>In 1951, grievances against the colonial distribution of land came to a head with the <a href="Kenya_Africa_Union" title="wikilink">Kenya Africa Union</a> demanding greater representation and <a href="land_reform" title="wikilink">land reform</a>. When these demands were rejected, more radical elements came forward, launching the <a href="Mau_Mau_Uprising" title="wikilink">Mau Mau rebellion</a> in 1952. On <a href="17_August" title="wikilink">17 August</a> <a href="1952" class="uri" title="wikilink">1952</a>, a <a href="state_of_emergency" title="wikilink">state of emergency</a> was declared, and British troops were flown to <a href="Kenya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kenya</a> to deal with the rebellion. As both sides increased the ferocity of their attacks, the country moved to full-scale civil war.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1953, the Lari massacre, perpetrated by Mau-Mau insurgents against <a href="Kikuyu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kikuyu</a> loyal to the British, changed the political complexion of the rebellion and gave the public-relations advantage to the British. Churchill's strategy was to use a military response, combined with implementing many of the concessions that Attlee's government had blocked in 1951. He ordered an increased military presence and appointed General Sir <a href="George_Erskine" title="wikilink">George Erskine</a>, who would implement Operation Anvil in 1954 that defeated the rebellion in the city of <a href="Nairobi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nairobi</a>.

As such, Britain's policy of direct confrontation and military victory had a great deal more support than in Iran or in Kenya. At the highpoint of the conflict, over 40,000 British and Commonwealth troops were stationed in Malaya. While the rebellion was slowly being defeated, it was equally clear that <a href="Colonialism" title="wikilink">colonial rule</a> from Britain was no longer plausible.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a><a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="stroke">Stroke</h3>
<p>In June 1953, when he was 78, Churchill suffered a stroke after a meeting with the <a href="Prime_minister_of_Italy" title="wikilink">Italian Prime Minister</a> <a href="Alcide_De_Gasperi" title="wikilink">Alcide De Gasperi</a> at <a href="10_Downing_Street" title="wikilink">10 Downing Street</a>. News of this was kept from the public and from Parliament, who were told that Churchill was suffering from exhaustion. He went to his country home, <a href="Chartwell" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chartwell</a>, to recuperate from the effects of the stroke which had affected his speech and ability to walk.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> He returned to <a href="Politics" title="wikilink">public life</a> in October to make a speech at a Conservative Party conference at <a href="Margate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Margate</a>, having decided that if he couldn't make the speech, he would retire as Prime Ministerâ€”but he was able to deliver it without problems.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a><a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a></p>
<p>Churchill's fondness for <a href="alcoholic_beverage" title="wikilink">alcohol</a> was well-documented.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> While in India and South Africa, he got in the habit of adding small amounts of <a href="whisky" class="uri" title="wikilink">whisky</a> to the <a href="water" class="uri" title="wikilink">water</a> he drank in order to prevent <a href="disease" class="uri" title="wikilink">disease</a>. He was quoted on the subject as saying that &quot;by dint of careful application I learned to like it.&quot; He consumed alcoholic drinks on a near-daily basis for long periods in his life, and frequently imbibed before, after, and during mealtimes. He is not generally however considered by historians to have been an <a href="alcoholism" title="wikilink">alcoholic</a>. The Churchill Centre states that Churchill made a bet with a man with the <a href="Family_name" title="wikilink">last name</a> of Rothermere (possibly one of the <a href="Viscount_Rothermere" title="wikilink">Viscounts Rothermere</a>) in 1936 that Churchill would be able to successfully abstain from drinking <a href="hard_liquor" title="wikilink">hard liquor</a> for a year; Churchill apparently won the bet.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="retirement-and-death">Retirement and death</h2>
<p>Aware that he was slowing down both physically and mentally, Churchill retired as <a href="Prime_Minister" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a> in 1955 and was succeeded by <a href="Anthony_Eden" title="wikilink">Anthony Eden</a>, who had long been his ambitious prot&lt;U+00E9&gt;g&lt;U+00E9&gt; (three years earlier, Eden had married Churchill's niece, Anne <a href="Clarissa_Eden,_Countess_of_Avon" title="wikilink">Clarissa Spencer-Churchill</a>, his second marriage). Upon his resignation, the Queen offered him a <a href="dukedom" class="uri" title="wikilink">dukedom</a> but he declined the offer.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> Over the coming years Churchill spent less time in parliament, occasionally voting in parliamentary divisions, but never again speaking in the House. He continued to serve as an MP for <a href="Woodford_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Woodford</a> until he stood down for the last time at the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1964" title="wikilink">1964 General Elections</a>. His private verdict on the <a href="Suez_Crisis" title="wikilink">Suez</a> fiasco was: &quot;I would never have done it without squaring the Americans, and once I'd started I'd never have dared stop&quot;.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> In 1959, he became <em><a href="Father_of_the_House" title="wikilink">Father of the House</a></em>, the MP with the longest continuous service: he had already gained the distinction of being the only MP to serve under both <a href="Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a> and <a href="Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Queen Elizabeth II</a>.

<p>As Churchill's mental and physical faculties decayed, he began to lose the battle he had fought for so long against the &quot;black dog&quot; of <a href="clinical_depression" title="wikilink">depression</a>. He found some solace in the sunshine and colours of the Mediterranean.

He also took eight cruises aboard the yacht <em>Christina</em> as the guest of <a href="Aristotle_Onassis" title="wikilink">Aristotle Onassis</a>. Once, when the <em>Christina</em> had to pass through the <a href="Dardanelles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dardanelles</a>, Onassis gave instructions that it was to do so during the night, so as not to disturb his guest with unhappy memories.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>

<p>Churchill's final years were melancholy. He never resolved the love&lt;U+2013&gt;hate relationship between himself and his son.

In the fields along the route, and at the stations through which the train passed, thousands stood in silence to pay their last respects. In 1998 his tombstone had to be replaced due to the large number of visitors over the years having eroded it and its surrounding area. A new stone was dedicated in a ceremony attended by members of the Spencer-Churchill family.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a></p>

But finally I remembered that I must die as I have always been; Winston Churchill. <a href="#fnref205" class="footnote-back">â†©</a></li>
