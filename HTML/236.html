The quote from an authenticated source most directly reflecting on the issue is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In ancient times the people of America were, through their northern regions, close to Asia, that is, separated from Asia by a strait. For this reason, it hath been said that crossing had occurred. There are other signs which indicate communication.</p>
<p>As to places whose people were not informed of the appearance of Prophets, such people are excused. In the Qur&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;n it hath been revealed: &lt;U+201C&gt;We will not chastise them if they had not been sent a Messenger&lt;U+201D&gt; (Q. 17:15).</p>

<p>In 1912 `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt; took a journey to the West from Chicago that included a trip to Canada and through the mid-West with stops in a few cities. As he was leaving Canada, on the way back to the States, he traveled through several villages .<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Perhaps most interesting is that the train passed through the town of <a href="Belleville,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Belleville</a> at 1:47pm according to researcher Will C.

<p>`Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or <a href="tablets_(religious)" title="wikilink">tablets</a>, to the followers of the religion in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book <em><a href="Tablets_of_the_Divine_Plan" title="wikilink">Tablets of the Divine Plan</a></em>. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention <a href="Latin_America" title="wikilink">Latin American</a> regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919&lt;U+2014&gt;after the end of the <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">First World War</a> and the <a href="Spanish_flu" title="wikilink">Spanish flu</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>Attach great importance to the indigenous population of America. For these souls may be likened unto the ancient inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula, who, prior to the Mission of Mu&lt;U+1E25&gt;ammad, were like unto savages. When the light of Mu&lt;U+1E25&gt;ammad shone forth in their midst, however, they became so radiant as to illumine the world.

<p>Following the Tablets and about the time of `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'s passing in 1921, a few other Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s began moving to, or at least visiting, Latin or South America.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> First <a href="Martha_Root" title="wikilink">Martha Root</a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> followed by <a href="Leonora_Armstrong" title="wikilink">Leonora Armstrong</a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> were among the first to make this trips before 1928.</p>
<h3 id="cultural-relationships-and-challenges">Cultural relationships and challenges</h3>
<p>The cultural norms in the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith have gone through major transitions.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The first occurred at about the turn of the 20th century when the religion became known beyond its mainly Muslim Middle-Eastern population and spread to Christian North America and Europe. The foundations of this achievement had been laid from the earliest days of the new religion when <a href="Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&#39;u&#39;ll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h</a> in two of his writings from the Baghdad period addressed Christian issues. Then towards the end of the nineteenth century, the famous Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; scholar, <a href="M&lt;U+00ED&gt;rz&lt;U+00E1&gt;_Abu&#39;l-Fadl" title="wikilink">M&lt;U+00ED&gt;rz&lt;U+00E1&gt; Abu'l-Fadl</a>, extended these foundations by writing extensively on Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; approaches to the New and Old Testaments. This was followed by the conversion of numerous Jews, in Iran, and Christians, in Syria and Egypt, to the religion. It was Syrian Christian converts in particular who were largely responsible for taking the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith to Christian North America, from where there was further spread to Europe and Australia. See also <a href="`Abdu&#39;l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&#39;s_journeys_to_the_West" title="wikilink">`Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'s journeys to the West</a>. The second major breakthrough started post-World War II when the religion began to spread rapidly in the villages of the Third World. Some idea of the extent of this comparatively sudden change can be gleaned from the fact that prior to 1954, approximately 94% of the world Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; population consisted of Iranians. By 1989, that figure is about 7% while Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s from the non-Muslim Third World represent some 90% of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>In Latin and South America the religion spread in the 1940s following specific plans of promulgating the religion.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> A stated purpose for the coordinating committees appointed to oversee the process was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American leading guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin leading guidance and North American cooperation.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. However a period of &quot;re-activating&quot; core communities was necessary in 1950, while other communities failed to re-elect their institutions initially<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> though the regional committees continued operation.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Nevertheless regional National Spiritual Assemblies for the region were elected in 1950<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and 1951.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> By 1961 most Latin and South American countries had their own national assembly.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>In Africa there was widespread conversions to the religion following the 1950s.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> It was emphasized that western pioneers be self-effacing and focus their efforts not on the colonial leadership but on the native Africans<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> - and that the pioneers must show by actions the sincerity of their sense of service to the Africans in bringing the religion and then the Africans who understand their new religion are to be given freedom to rise up and spread the religion according to their own sensibilities and the pioneers to disperse or step into the background.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> <a href="Enoch_Olinga" title="wikilink">Enoch Olinga</a> is specifically mentioned as an example of this process unfolding as he arose out of Uganda and repeated the quick growth of the religion. Because of the successive waves of people becoming <a href="Knights_of_Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&#39;u&#39;ll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h" title="wikilink">Knights of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h</a>, Enoch Olinga was entitled &quot;Abd'l-Futuh&quot;, a Persian name meaning &quot;the father of victories&quot; by Shoghi Effendi<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> though he too implemented changes in character by giving up alcoholism<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> and eventually polygamy.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>In India where the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; message had for decades been primarily addressed to Indian Muslims and Parsees (Zoroastrians), a re-interpretation of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; message in accordance with Hindu ideas was necessary to reach the masses of Hindus.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> India became the largest Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; community in the world in 2000 after less than a century of mass teaching<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> though it also entailed systematically reaching a large community of Untouchables or <a href="Harijans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harijans</a>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> See <a href="Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&#39;&lt;U+00ED&gt;_Faith_in_India" title="wikilink">Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith in India</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the spread of Christianity within Indian country in the United States, the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+2018&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith has never been associated with a fortification of colonial occupation, Euro-American assimilation, or forced conversions of Native Americans. Indeed in 1960 <a href="Hand_of_the_Cause" title="wikilink">Hand of the Cause</a> <a href="R&lt;U+00FA&gt;h&lt;U+00ED&gt;yyih_Kh&lt;U+00E1&gt;num" title="wikilink">R&lt;U+00FA&gt;h&lt;U+00ED&gt;yyih Kh&lt;U+00E1&gt;num</a> asked for forgiveness for the injustices her race had done and praised their great past.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> And in 1963 anthropologist <a href="Alice_Beck_Kehoe" title="wikilink">Alice Beck Kehoe</a>, a well known researcher of Native Americans, observed that the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+2018&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith is considered by its members to be a universal faith, not tied to any one particular culture, religious background, language, or even country of origin. However one researcher, based on experience as a scholar and elder of in an Indian tribe, observed in 2007: &quot;Most white Canadians and Americans have no clue with respect to how constantly they reinforce their own cultural assumptions, right or wrong, and pile them upon Indians, never willing or even interested in hearing our own Native view. I agree that the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+2018&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt;s in Canada and the U.S. have made some good headway in the honoring and validating native spiritual prophecies and principles. However, much more transformation along the lines of intercultural interactions within the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+2018&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt; international community needs to take place. In particular, I am referring specifically to most (but not all) of our non-Native Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+2018&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt;s who find it impossible to break through the inner barriers of their own Euro-American culture.&quot;<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>In a context of difficulties in relationships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples there is a pattern on the one hand of indigenous efforts of entrenched violent confrontation for self-determination and on the other of wholesale romanticization of Native culture, religion, and lifestyle. The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; encounter with Aboriginals in British Colombia was observed by another anthropologist that, while not fully transformed, the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith's encounter with Indians was a forceful illustration that something between the extremes was possible between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples. While the goals of equality and unity in diversity had yet to be fully realized within the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt; community, the religion has nevertheless served as a potent source of empowerment for Aboriginal adherents. Adoption of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith has not entailed a stark renunciation of preexisting forms of Aboriginal belief, practice, or identity. Rather, it has served as a firm source of confirmation and connection, reinforcing the validity of Aboriginal culture and fostering pride in Aboriginal heritage. However relatively few of the over nine hundred Aboriginal people who enrolled in the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+2018&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith in British Columbia between 1948 and 1992 ultimately became active adherent and despite such empowering impact, patterns of non-Aboriginal cultural dominance encountered within the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+2018&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt; community simultaneously suggest the pervasiveness of the colonial legacy and the potency of contemporary social context; good intentions proved insufficient to fully transform intercultural interactions.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> But there is progress in appreciation of Indian cultural and spiritual experience coming through Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; publishing channels<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> just as there has been of Islam over a century ago.<ref>For example some books by <a href="Stanwood_Cobb" title="wikilink">Stanwood Cobb</a>:</p>

<p>Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; radio in Ecuador evolved as a way to serve the thousands of converts in the late 1960s and 1970s.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> A native of <a href="Otavalo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Otavalo</a>, Ecuador and chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly of Ecuador investigated using radio as a tool for spreading the religion and serving the newly forming communities. In early 1973, Raul Pavon leased Radio Turismo station and initiated fourteen hours of daily broadcasts. None involved had backgrounding in running a radio station. Initial success was based on playing local and national music genre. In July 1973 the national assembly added the goal of a radio station to its budget and a committee to create programing. Programming was developed and aired in eight cities between 15-minute segments up to hour-long bilingual (Spanish-Quichua) programs of <a href="Prayer_in_the_Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&#39;&lt;U+00ED&gt;_Faith" title="wikilink">Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; prayers</a>, and drawing from <a href="Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&#39;&lt;U+00ED&gt;_literature" title="wikilink">Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; literature</a> as well as information of its world-wide community. In 1975, training workshops were organized for scriptwriters. Other trainings continued in 1976. By 1976 the committee had produced 1286 hours of programming at a cost of approximately $2000 as well as documentation to support sister projects. A low-power <a href="Amplitude_modulation" title="wikilink">AM</a> radio station which was finally granted in 1977. There were challenges of coordination and staffing to overcome. Outside trainers or professional staff were able to come in 1977, 1978, and 1980. A commission was developed, typically including a body composed of an indigenous person, a &quot;white&quot; person, technical experts, senior Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s and a veteran of the station, with a balance of majority of local people while also one member to be literate and capable of dealing with the administration of the commission.</p>

It was not until 1981 that a suitable director was able to take up service by combining the qualities of being a Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;, an experienced radio professional, and an Ecuadoran and able to volunteer. In addition to Quinteros, six other indigenous had systematically begun to serve at the station as full-time staff as well as larger numbers of part-time staff amounting to some 200 persons including indigenous youth in the first four years of the operation of the station. Indigenous staff were able to conduct workshops for other indigenous staff, in Spanish and Quichua, for the first time in 1981. Staff for projects in Bolivia, Chile and Peru participated in successive training and Ecuadoran staff traveled to Peru and Bolivia to assist in those projects. The Commission wrote to the Chilean Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s about the development of their radio station that:</p>

<p>In Panama's remote indigenous villages Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; volunteers run ten primary schools where the government does not provide access to a school. Later a <a href="FUNDESCU" class="uri" title="wikilink">FUNDESCU</a><a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> stipend of $50 per month was made available for 13 teachers and the Ministry of Education added funds for a 14th. As subsistence farmers, the villagers have no money or food to offer. Instead they take turns providing firewood for an outdoor kitchen or build small wood-framed shelters with corrugated zinc panels and a narrow wooden platform for a bed. The teachers and administrators do not seek to convert the students. Some of the villagers are Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s, some are Catholics, some Evangelicals, and some follow the native <a href="Mama_Tata" title="wikilink">Mama Tata</a> religion. In all, about half the students are Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s (about 150). Nevertheless there is a strong moral component to the program including a weekly class on &quot;Virtues and Values.&quot; Over the years, some training for the teachers has been provided but many have not finished the twelfth grade including some women who have faced difficulties getting even that much education.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a><a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a></p>
