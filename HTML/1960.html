<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Prospect was opened in <a href="1957" class="uri" title="wikilink">1957</a> as a freshman campus for the now-defunct Arlington High School. By the next school year, the district had grown enough that Prospect was turned into a full four-year school.<a href="http://www.d214.org/community/info/history.php">1</a></p>
<p>In <a href="August" class="uri" title="wikilink">August</a> <a href="1995" class="uri" title="wikilink">1995</a>, on only the second day of the new school year, the school's field house suffered a fire. The cause of the fire was nothing short of a freak accident. Thick mats used by the track team (mostly the mats for high jump) had been out in the blistering sun on the previous day. The mats, with the heat of the sun still within them, were placed above a loft in the field house. One of the mats rested against a frayed electrical cord. The heat of the mat combined with the frayed wiring started the fire. The scoreboard and school record plaques were melted in the fire, though the most damage came from the water damage from the fire hoses. The field house was closed off for most of the 1995-1996 school year. The field house re-opened with a much-needed lighting improvement, better basketball floor, and new paint.</p>
<p>The most recent additions to the school have been a library in <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a>, a new art wing in <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>, and a new cafeteria in <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a>. As of <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, work is being done to remove <a href="Asbestos" title="wikilink">asbestos</a> from the older parts of the building.</p>
<h2 id="academics">Academics</h2>
<p>In <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, Prospect had an average composite <a href="ACT_(examination)" title="wikilink">ACT</a> score of 23.5, and graduated 93.0% of its senior class. Prospect has made <a href="Adequate_Yearly_Progress" title="wikilink">Adequate Yearly Progress</a> on the <a href="Prairie_State_Achievement_Examination" title="wikilink">Prairie State Achievement Examination</a>, a state test used for the <a href="No_Child_Left_Behind_Act" title="wikilink">No Child Left Behind Act</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
