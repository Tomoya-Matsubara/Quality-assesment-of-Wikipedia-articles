<p>The <strong>iPhone 5</strong> is a <a href="touchscreen" class="uri" title="wikilink">touchscreen</a>-based <a href="smartphone" class="uri" title="wikilink">smartphone</a> developed by <a href="Apple_Inc." title="wikilink">Apple</a>. It is the <a href="List_of_iOS_devices" title="wikilink">sixth generation</a> of the <a href="iPhone" class="uri" title="wikilink">iPhone</a> and succeeds the <a href="iPhone_4S" title="wikilink">iPhone 4S</a>. The phone is a slimmer, lighter model that introduces a higher-resolution, 4-inch screen to the series with <a href="16:9" class="uri" title="wikilink">16:9</a> widescreen <a href="display_aspect_ratio" title="wikilink">aspect ratio</a>. The phone also includes a custom-designed <a href="ARM_architecture" title="wikilink">ARMv7</a> processor called the <a href="Apple_A6" title="wikilink">Apple A6</a>, an update to Apple's mobile operating system known as <a href="iOS_6" title="wikilink">iOS 6</a>, and support for <a href="LTE_(telecommunication)" title="wikilink">LTE</a>.</p>
<p>Apple held an event to formally introduce the phone on September 12, 2012. After Apple began taking pre-orders on September 14, 2012, over two million were received within 24 hours. Initial demand for the iPhone 5 exceeded the supply available at launch on September 21, 2012, and has been described by Apple as &quot;extraordinary&quot;, with pre-orders having sold twenty times faster than its predecessors. After the launch of the device, Samsung filed a lawsuit against Apple, claiming that the iPhone 5 infringes eight of its patents.</p>
<p>While reception to the iPhone 5 has been generally positive, the new <a href="Maps_(application)" title="wikilink">Maps</a> application has been negatively received and was reported to contain many serious errors. Several hardware issues have also received criticism from consumers and reviewers, including an unintended purple hue in photos taken by the iPhone 5, an issue with its coating being prone to chipping, and the presence of light leaks on white variants of the device. Incompatibilities with LTE networks in some regions have been noted.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>


<p>Rumors about the  began shortly after the announcement of the <a href="iPhone_4S" title="wikilink">iPhone 4S</a>, though detailed leaks did not emerge until June 2012.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> On July 30, 2012, reports pinpointed the dates that the iPhone 5 would be unveiled and released on, along with some accurate predictions of its features.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> On September 4, 2012, Apple announced they would be hosting an event at the <a href="Yerba_Buena_Center_for_the_Arts" title="wikilink">Yerba Buena Center for the Arts</a> in <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a> on September 12, 2012. A shadow of the number 5 was featured in the invitations sent to the media, suggesting that the next iPhone would be unveiled at the event.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>At the unveiling, Apple announced the iPhone 5 and also introduced new <a href="iPod_Nano" title="wikilink">iPod Nano</a> and <a href="iPod_Touch" title="wikilink">iPod Touch</a> models. They also stated that pre-orders would be accepted starting September 14, 2012.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Over two million pre-orders were received within 24 hours.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Initial demand for the new phone exceeded the record set by its predecessor, the <a href="iPhone_4S" title="wikilink">iPhone 4S</a>, by selling over 5 million units in the first three days.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> On November 30, 2012, Apple added an unlocked version of the iPhone 5 to their online US store, with the 16 GB model starting at US$649.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="litigation">Litigation</h3>

<p>Following the release of the iPhone 5, <a href="Samsung" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samsung</a> announced that it was filing a lawsuit against Apple for <a href="Patent_infringement" title="wikilink">infringing</a> eight of its <a href="patent" title="wikilink">patents</a>. The case is scheduled to begin in 2014.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In a statement, Samsung said, it had &quot;little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Litigation between the two involving patent infringement has been ongoing and is being fought in several court cases around the world. Apple has won preliminary injunctions against the <a href="Galaxy_Nexus" title="wikilink">Galaxy Nexus</a> smartphone co-developed by Samsung. In August 2012, Apple added the <a href="Samsung_Galaxy_S_III" title="wikilink">Samsung Galaxy S III</a> to a list of models it also claims infringe its patents.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p>The components and labor required to construct the most basic iPhone 5 is estimated to cost US$207, which is US$19 more than the cost of components for the corresponding iPhone 4S model. The LTE module in the iPhone 5 alone costs $34, $10 more than the cellular module in the iPhone 4S. Similarly, screens used in the iPhone 5 costs $44, which is $7 more than the screen of its predecessor. <a href="Mashable" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mashable</a> noted that the profit margin of selling each device is &quot;huge&quot; as the iPhone 5 retails for US$649.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Subsequently after the announcement of the device, a lack of supply of the iPhone 5 was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen; reports emerged, stating that <a href="Sharp_Corporation" title="wikilink">Sharp</a> was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5 and other manufacturers reported that it was difficult to keep up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="quality-control-inspectors-strike">Quality control inspectors strike</h3>
<p><a href="China_Labor_Watch" title="wikilink">China Labor Watch</a> reported that &lt;U+201C&gt;three to four thousand&lt;U+201D&gt; <a href="Foxconn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Foxconn</a> workers who work at iPhone 5 production plant in <a href="Zhengzhou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zhengzhou</a> stopped working on October 5, 2012.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The strikes occurred after Apple implemented a stricter quality standard on their products, which include a 0.02 mm restriction on indentations inflicted during production and imposed demands related to scratches on frames and back cover.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The strikes were also attributed to the employer forcing employees to work on a public holiday. The report stated training was inadequate for quality demands expected and led to employees producing products that did not meet standards. During the strike, conflicts between quality control inspectors and employees resulted in brawls. China Labor Watch also claimed that concerns raised by inspectors were not addressed by factory management.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> <a href="Foxconn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Foxconn</a> spokesman admitted that a problem in the <a href="micromanagement" class="uri" title="wikilink">micromanagement</a> exists, but also said that there were only 300 to 400 workers absent and the conflicts did not influence production processes.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In November 2012, Foxconn chairman, <a href="Terry_Gou" title="wikilink">Terry Gou</a> reported that the delay in production was due to undisclosed difficulties in assembly.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

Input to the device comes from a keyboard displayed on the multi-touch screen or by voice-to text by speaking into the microphone. Entered text is supported by predictive and suggestion software; there is a multi-language spell-checker which recognises many regional accents of different languages.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>iOS 6 features several new and/or updated apps, which includes <a href="Apple_Maps" title="wikilink">Apple Maps</a> and <a href="Passbook_(application)" title="wikilink">Passbook</a>. Apple's built-in Maps app, which replaced the former Maps app powered by Google Maps, has been universally derided and lacks many features present in competing maps apps. It is also known to give inaccurate directions.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> It uses Apple&lt;U+2019&gt;s new vector-based engine that eliminates <a href="lag" class="uri" title="wikilink">lag</a>, making for smoother <a href="Zooming_user_interface" title="wikilink">zooming</a>.

The phone's aluminum body is  thick. Apple at the conference claims it is the thinnest smartphone in the world at 7.6 mm, though that claim has been disputed as the Oppo Finder is thinner and some other smartphones can be considered to be thinner, depending upon where thickness is measured. The Oppo Finder measures 6.65 mm at its thinnest point and 7.1 mm at its thickest point making it overall thinner than the iPhone.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p>42 officially recognized bands exist for LTE, however rollouts are coalescing around the more-popular bands, based on what historically has been made available in specific regions. In Europe, bands available for LTE include, 2.6 GHz (the 3G-expansion band) and 800 MHz (cleared of analogue TV), with 1,800 MHz appearing in a few places including the UK. In Germany, the only carrier network supported is that of <a href="T-Mobile" class="uri" title="wikilink">T-Mobile</a> with its 1,800 MHz band allocated to LTE.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Some countries in Europe, including <a href="Denmark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Denmark</a>, <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a>, <a href="Sweden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sweden</a>, and others&lt;U+2014&gt;will not be able to offer LTE connectivity via the iPhone 5 to their customers on their current LTE networks, as they have already deployed LTE in the 2.6 GHz band, which the iPhone 5 does not support.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>Unlike the iPhone 4S, which was the only &quot;<a href="world_phone" title="wikilink">world phone</a>&quot; produced by Apple, there are three versions of the iPhone 5, which differ by the frequency used. All three work on 2G <a href="GSM" class="uri" title="wikilink">GSM</a>/<a href="GPRS" class="uri" title="wikilink">GPRS</a> and 3G <a href="UMTS" class="uri" title="wikilink">UMTS</a>/<a href="EDGE" class="uri" title="wikilink">EDGE</a> networks on both the 800 and 1900 MHz bands used in the Americas, and the 900 and 1800 MHz bands used elsewhere. The CDMA A1429 model works on <a href="CDMA" class="uri" title="wikilink">CDMA</a> networks, such as that of Sprint and Verizon. Another version supports LTE only on the 1700/2100 MHz <a href="Advanced_Wireless_Services" title="wikilink">AWS</a> band, and the 700 MHz band recovered after the forced <a href="DTV_transition_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">conversion to digital television</a> in the US (channels 52 to 56), currently the only network that supports the band is AT&amp;T.
