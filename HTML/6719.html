Having caught them by surprise they opened fire on the stationary boats and after a short engagement withdrew leaving two of the enemy boats on fire.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> For this action Hichens received a second MID, other members of the flotilla were awarded one DSC, two DSM's and four MID's.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>The flotilla was ordered back to Felixstowe in Autumn 1942.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Their first contact with the enemy was on the night 14/15 September when they engaged a small convoy off the Hook of Holland. They followed a convoy that was escorted by four Flak trawlers almost into harbour before inflicting considerable damage to it.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> For this, Hichens was awarded a second bar to the DSC.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Other members of the flotilla were awarded one DSC, two DSM's and one MID.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>Hichens, now the recipient of two DSOs, three DSCs and two MIDs, was offered promotion to <a href="commander" class="uri" title="wikilink">commander</a> in command of <a href="HMS_Bee" title="wikilink">HMS <em>Bee</em></a> at <a href="Weymouth,_Dorset" title="wikilink">Weymouth, Dorset</a> and a training post ashore. Feeling unsuited for such a role, he declined and remained commander of the 8th MGB flotilla.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="casualties">Casualties</h3>
<p>The flotilla lost its first boat during the night action 2/3 October 1942. Engaging four trawlers MGB 78 went in for a depth charge attack and was lost to enemy fire.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Another boat, MGB 76, was lost during the night of 5/6 October 1942, when the flotilla was ambushed by two German torpedo boats and a number of E boats.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>The winter months of 1942/43 were uneventful, and Hichens started to write his unfinished account of the war. <em>We fought them in Gunboats</em> was published posthumously in 1944.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>The flotilla, accompanied by four MTBs and escorting mine laying <a href="Motor_Launch" title="wikilink">Motor Launches</a> (ML), were next in action over the night of 27/28 February 1943. The mixed flotilla engaged a convoy escorted by two trawlers and a minesweeper, and lost MGB 79 to enemy fire. Hichens closed with the stricken boat, which was on fire, to remove the crew. They managed to rescue seven of the crew before being forced to withdraw under fire. Hichens' own boat, MGB 77, was also set on fire during the rescue.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>On the night of 12/13 April 1943, the flotilla was ordered to escort mine laying MLs off the Dutch coast. Detecting two trawlers they engaged them leaving one on fire, but as they withdrew MGB 77 was hit, killing Hichens outright and wounding three others on the bridge.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Hichens received a <a href="posthumous_recognition" title="wikilink">posthumous</a> MID for these actions.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="victoria-cross-recomendation">Victoria Cross recomendation</h2>
<p>Hichens was recommended for the <a href="Victoria_Cross" title="wikilink">Victoria Cross</a> for his actions during the night of 27/28 February. When informed by his <a href="commanding_officer" title="wikilink">commanding officer</a>, Commander Kerr, of the intention to recommend him, Hichens requested that the recommendation be dropped as he now felt he had endangered two of the boats in the flotilla trying to rescue his friends. Kerr, respecting his views, dropped the recommendation, only for it to be resubmitted six weeks later after his death. The recommendation was endorsed by Commander Kerr, <a href="Admiral" class="uri" title="wikilink">Admiral</a> Lyon (the <a href="Commander-in-chief" class="uri" title="wikilink">Commander-in-chief</a> at <a href="Nore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nore</a>) and <a href="Rear_admiral" title="wikilink">Rear Admiral</a> Rogers (the <a href="Flag_officer" title="wikilink">Flag officer</a> in charge at <a href="Harwich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harwich</a>). The recommendation was rejected by the Admiralty, citing the same reasons Hichens had himself given.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|After having decided that they were not going to award a Victoria Cross, under the British honours system at the time the only other option left to the authorities was a posthumous MID.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a>|group=nb}}</p>
