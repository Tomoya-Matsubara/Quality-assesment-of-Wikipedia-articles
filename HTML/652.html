<p>During the late 1990's prior to amalgamation, a teacher at <a href="Greely_Elementary_School" title="wikilink">Greely Elementary School</a> was killed in a motor-vehicle accident at the intersection of Old Prescott Road and Parkway Road. The <a href="Regional_Municipality_of_Ottawa-Carleton" title="wikilink">Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton</a> did a study of the intersection following an outcry by the community demanding a four way light, but the <a href="Osgoode_Township" title="wikilink">Osgoode Township</a> Council only approved a four-way <a href="stop_sign" title="wikilink">stop sign</a>. A year later, it was replaced with a four way <a href="traffic_light" title="wikilink">traffic light</a> due to the noise of trucks stopping at the stop signs.</p>
