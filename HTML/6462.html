<p><strong><em>Sesame Street</em></strong> is an <a href="Television_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> educational <a href="children&#39;s_television_series" title="wikilink">children's television series</a> for <a href="nursery_school" title="wikilink">preschoolers</a> and is a pioneer of the contemporary educational television standard, combining both <a href="edutainment" title="wikilink">education and entertainment</a>. <em>Sesame Street</em> is well known for its <a href="The_Muppets" title="wikilink">Muppet</a> characters, created by the <a href="puppeteer" class="uri" title="wikilink">puppeteer</a> <a href="Jim_Henson" title="wikilink">Jim Henson</a>. More than 4,134 episodes of the show<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> have been produced in 36 seasons, which makes it one of the <a href="List_of_longest_running_U.S._television_series" title="wikilink">longest-running</a> television shows in <a href="History_of_television" title="wikilink">history</a>.</p>
<p><em>Sesame Street</em> is produced in the United States by non-profit organization <a href="Sesame_Workshop" title="wikilink">Sesame Workshop</a>, formerly known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), founded by <a href="Joan_Ganz_Cooney" title="wikilink">Joan Ganz Cooney</a> and <a href="Ralph_Rogers" title="wikilink">Ralph Rogers</a>. It premiered on <a href="November_10" title="wikilink">November 10th</a>, <a href="1969_in_television" title="wikilink">1969</a>, on the <a href="National_Educational_Television" title="wikilink">National Educational Television</a> network, and later that year it was moved to NET's replacement, the <a href="Public_Broadcasting_Service" title="wikilink">Public Broadcasting Service</a>.</p>
<p>With its positive influence, <em>Sesame Street</em> is the most highly regarded educational show for children in the world.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> No television series has matched its level of international recognition and success. The original series has been televised in 120 <a href="country" title="wikilink">countries</a>,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and more than 20 international versions have been produced, not including <a href="Dubbing_(filmmaking)" title="wikilink">dubbed</a> versions. The series has received 109 <a href="Emmy_Awards" title="wikilink">Emmy Awards</a>, more than any other television series.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> An estimated 75 million Americans have watched the series as children;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> millions more have watched around the world, as have their parents.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Sesame Street uses a combination of <a href="puppet" title="wikilink">puppets</a>, animation, and live actors to teach young children letter and word recognition, mathematics (numbers, addition and subtraction), as well as geometric forms, and classification. Since the show's inception, other instructional goals have been basic life skills, such as how to cross the street safely, proper hygiene, healthy eating habits, and social skills.</p>
<p>The show displays a subtle sense of humour that has appealed to older viewers since it first premiered; this was devised as a means to encourage parents and older siblings to watch the series with younger children, thus becoming involved in the learning process, rather than having <em>Sesame Street</em> act as a babysitter. A number of parodies of popular culture appear, especially ones aimed at the <a href="Public_Broadcasting_Service" title="wikilink">Public Broadcasting Service</a>, the network that broadcasts the show. For example, the recurring segment <a href="Monsterpiece_Theatre" title="wikilink">Monsterpiece Theatre</a> once ran a sketch called &quot;Me Claudius&quot;. Children viewing the show might enjoy watching <a href="Cookie_Monster" title="wikilink">Cookie Monster</a> and <a href="the_Muppets" title="wikilink">the Muppets</a>, while adults watching the same sequence may enjoy the spoof of the <em><a href="Masterpiece_Theatre" title="wikilink">Masterpiece Theatre</a></em> showing of <em><a href="I,_Claudius_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">I, Claudius</a></em> on PBS. <img src="Tv_sesame_street_grover_and_a_boy.jpg" title="fig:Some of the show&#39;s most authentic and memorable moments were unscripted conversations between Muppets, such as Grover (above) or Kermit, and real children." alt="Some of the show&#39;s most authentic and memorable moments were unscripted conversations between Muppets, such as Grover (above) or Kermit, and real children." width="200" /> Several of the character names used on the program are puns or cultural references aimed at a slightly older audience, including Flo Bear (<a href="Gustave_Flaubert" title="wikilink">Flaubert</a>), <a href="Sherlock_Hemlock" title="wikilink">Sherlock Hemlock</a> (a <a href="Sherlock_Holmes" title="wikilink">Sherlock Holmes</a> parody), H. Ross Parrot (based on Reform Party founder <a href="H._Ross_Perot" title="wikilink">H. Ross Perot</a>), Dr. Feel based on <a href="Dr._Phil" title="wikilink">Dr. Phil</a>, Polly Darton (<a href="Dolly_Parton" title="wikilink">Dolly Parton</a>), and a <a href="Jack_Bauer" title="wikilink">Jack Bauer</a> Muppet in a parody of <em><a href="24_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">24</a></em>. Over two hundred notable personalities have made guest appearances on the show, beginning with <a href="Carol_Burnett" title="wikilink">Carol Burnett</a> on the first episode, and ranging from performers like <a href="James_Brown" title="wikilink">James Brown</a> and <a href="Johnny_Cash" title="wikilink">Johnny Cash</a>, to political figures such as <a href="Laura_Bush" title="wikilink">Laura Bush</a> and <a href="Kofi_Annan" title="wikilink">Kofi Annan</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> By making a show that not only educates and entertains kids, but also keeps parents entertained and involved in the educational process, the producers hope to inspire discussion about the concepts on the show.</p>
<p>In 1999, the series became the longest running American children's program, taking the title from <em><a href="Captain_Kangaroo" title="wikilink">Captain Kangaroo</a></em>. The British series <em><a href="Blue_Peter" title="wikilink">Blue Peter</a></em> still retains the worldwide record.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The series has made many published lists, including greatest all-time show compilations by <em><a href="TV_Guide" title="wikilink">TV Guide</a></em> and <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em>. Nielsen Media Research has found that 99% of American preschoolers recognise the series' characters.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Another study** found that 81% of kids under the age of six own a <em>Sesame Street</em> toy or game, and 87% own a book based on the series.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>The series' music has appeared on music charts around the world, including Ernie's &quot;Rubber Duckie&quot; song, which made #16 on the <a href="Billboard_Hot_100" title="wikilink">Billboard Hot 100</a> chart in 1970; the song achieved an even higher position in Germany.

<p>The show's original format called for the humans to be intermixed with the segments of animation, live-action shorts and <a href="The_Muppets" title="wikilink">Muppets</a>. These segments were created to be like commercials — quick, catchy and memorable — and made the learning experience much more like fun. The format became a model for what is known today as <a href="edutainment" class="uri" title="wikilink">edutainment</a>-based programming.</p>
<p>CTW aired the program for test groups to determine if the revolutionary new format was likely to succeed. Results showed that test watchers were entranced when the ad-like segments aired, especially those with the jovial puppets, but were remarkably less interested in the street scenes. Psychologists warned CTW against a mixture of fantasy and reality elements, but producers soon decided to mix the elements. A simple dose of cartoon-like characters lets the humans deliver messages without causing viewers to lose interest.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Sesame Street</em>, along with several other <a href="Sesame_Workshop" title="wikilink">Sesame Workshop</a> – produced shows (such as <em><a href="The_Electric_Company" title="wikilink">The Electric Company</a></em>, which was produced when Sesame Workshop was still CTW) are all taped in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>. Originally they were taped at the <a href="Teletape_Studios" title="wikilink">Teletape Studios</a> at 81st and Broadway in Manhattan, but the bankruptcy of Teletape's parent company, Reeves Entertainment, forced these productions to move to <a href="Kaufman_Astoria_Studios" title="wikilink">Kaufman Astoria Studios</a> in neighboring <a href="Queens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queens</a>.</p>
<p>The brownstone architecture of <em>Sesame Street</em>, a fictional <a href="neighborhood" class="uri" title="wikilink">neighborhood</a> in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, as well as the concept of neighbors from different backgrounds living in the same area and sharing their life experiences, was loosely based on Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn - where several of the founding producers were living at the time.</p>
<h2 id="broadcast-history">Broadcast history</h2>
<p>The show is broadcast worldwide; in addition to the U.S. version, many countries have locally-produced versions adapted to local needs, some with their own characters, and in a variety of different languages. In <a href="Television_in_Canada" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, beginning in 1970, 15-minute shows called <em>Canada's Sesame Street</em> were broadcast, and by 1972 an edited version of the one-hour American program was airing but with specially filmed Canadian segments, which featured the <a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French language</a>. In 1995 the American version was replaced by a half-hour long all-Canadian version of the series entitled <em><a href="Sesame_Park" title="wikilink">Sesame Park</a></em>. Since the original <em>Sesame Street</em> was still accessible to Canadians, and more familiar, the format change didn't find acceptance with audiences and was taken off the air in 2002. Broadcasts in <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a> and <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> began in 1971. In the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>, the show was first broadcast by various <a href="ITV" class="uri" title="wikilink">ITV</a> regions in the early 1970s, after which it moved to <a href="Channel_4" title="wikilink">Channel 4</a>, where it was a lunch-time fixture for many years through to the early 2000s. Later broadcasts of the show featured the hour-long episodes in a format of two half-hour episodes. 120 countries have aired the show, many of which partnered with Sesame Workshop to create local versions.</p>
<p>In recent years <em>Sesame Street</em> has made what area educators consider to be critical advances in its international versions. In the late 1990s versions appeared in <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a> and <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a> as these countries shifted away from communism. There is also a joint <a href="Israel" title="wikilink">Israeli</a>-<a href="Palestinian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Palestinian</a>-<a href="Jordan" title="wikilink">Jordanian</a> project, called <em>Sesame Stories</em>, which was created with the goal of promoting greater cultural understanding.</p>
<p>The show has also spawned the spin-off series <em><a href="Play_with_Me_Sesame" title="wikilink">Play with Me Sesame</a></em>, <a href="ESL" class="uri" title="wikilink">ESL</a> program <em><a href="Sesame_English" title="wikilink">Sesame English</a></em>, the &quot;classics&quot; show <em><a href="Sesame_Street_Unpaved" title="wikilink">Sesame Street Unpaved</a></em>, and the segment-only series <em><a href="Open_Sesame" title="wikilink">Open Sesame</a></em>. <em><a href="Elmo&#39;s_World" title="wikilink">Elmo's World</a></em> and <em><a href="Global_Grover" title="wikilink">Global Grover</a></em>, both of which are segments of <em>Sesame Street</em>, have been distributed as individual series. Jennifer Monier-Williams, Vice President, Worldwide Television Distribution at Sesame Workshop commented &quot;The expansion of the <em>Sesame</em> brand through wonderfully interactive shows like <em>Play With Me Sesame</em> and <em>Elmo's World</em> give children around the globe new ways to experience fun and learning in the way Sesame does it best.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>Occasionally local businesses and organizations fund local telecasts of <em>Sesame Street</em> on PBS stations throughout the U.S. For example, the <a href="W._M._Keck_Foundation" title="wikilink">W.

<p>Within the context of the show, and before the actual underwriting announcements, it is announced that &quot;Sesame Street is brought to you by&quot; the letters and numbers of the day, as though they too were sponsors.</p>
<h3 id="ratings">Ratings</h3>
<p>As a result of its success in revolutionizing the standards of children's television, <em>Sesame Street</em> inadvertently diminished its own audience share. According to PBS Research, the show went from a 2.0 average on <a href="Nielsen_Media_Research" title="wikilink">Nielsen Media Research</a>'s &quot;people meters&quot; in 1995–96 to a 1.3 average in 2000–01. Even with this decrease, <em>Sesame Street</em>'s viewership in an average week came from roughly 5.6 million households with 7.5 million viewers. This placed <em>Sesame</em> at 8th place in the overall kids' charts, as of 2002. The program fares better among mothers age 18–49 who had children under the age of 3, taking second place.</p>
<p>A format change helped the show's ratings, boosting them up 31% in February 2002 among children age 2–5, in comparison to its ratings in 2001. As of 2005, <em>Sesame Street</em> and three other PBS shows are in the top 10 shows for children ages 2 to 5.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> As of season 36 in 2005, there were 8 million viewers daily.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p><em>Sesame Street</em> is known for its <a href="Multiculturalism" title="wikilink">multicultural</a> element and is inclusive in its casting, incorporating roles for disabled people, young people, senior citizens, Hispanic actors, Black actors, and others. While some of the puppets look like people, others are animal or &quot;monster&quot; puppets of different sizes and colors. This encourages children to believe that people come in all different shapes, sizes, and colors, and that no particular physical &quot;type&quot; is any better than another. Jim Henson commented that &quot;The only kids who can identify along racial lines with the Muppets have to be either green or orange.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>In harmony with its multiculturalist perspective, the show pioneered the idea of occasionally inserting very basic Spanish words and phrases to help young children become acquainted with the concept of a foreign language, doing so almost three decades before <a href="Dora_the_Explorer" title="wikilink">Dora the Explorer</a> made her debut on <a href="Nickelodeon_(TV_channel)" title="wikilink">Nickelodeon</a>. Perhaps in response to the popularity of Dora, the recently revamped format gives <a href="Rosita,_la_Monstrua_de_las_Cuevas" title="wikilink">Rosita</a>, the bilingual muppet who &quot;emigrated&quot; in 1993 from the Mexican version of the show, more time in front of viewers, and also introduced the more formalized &quot;Spanish Word of the Day&quot; in every episode.</p>
<p>Each of the puppet characters has been designed to represent a specific stage or element of early childhood, and the scripts are written so that the character reflects the development level of children of that age. This helps the show address not only the learning objectives of various age groups, but also the concerns, fears, and interests of children of different age levels.</p>
<h3 id="the-muppets">The Muppets</h3>
<p><a href="Big_Bird" title="wikilink">Big Bird</a> is an 8-foot 2-inch-tall yellow <a href="canary" class="uri" title="wikilink">canary</a> who lives in a large nest on an abandoned lot which is located behind 123 Sesame Street's garbage heap. Big Bird is often visited by his friend <a href="Aloysius_Snuffleupagus" title="wikilink">Aloysius Snuffleupagus</a>, who is a very large, brown woolly elephant-like creature and is known more popularly by his nickname &quot;Snuffy&quot;. Various other Snuffleupaguses have appeared on the show from time to time, most notably Snuffy's little sister Alice and his unnamed mother. Initially, Snuffy showed up when no one but Big Bird was around, leaving the rest of the neighborhood to think he was imaginary. In the mid-1980s, however, Snuffy was revealed to be &quot;real&quot; and incorporated into the regular cast of the show.</p>

<p>A slate of human regulars pull the zaniness of the Muppets back to reality. They were not always meant to serve this purpose. The show lost test viewers' attention during the Street Scenes, meaning Muppets needed to be added, to hide the fact it was educational.</p>

When Lee died in 1982, the producers opted to help their young viewers deal with the death of someone they loved rather than cast a new actor in the role, and the character's death was discussed in a landmark 1983 episode.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Afterwards, Hooper's apprentice David took over, followed by later owners Gina, Mr. Handford, and Alan.

The art of Keith Haring, filmmaking of William Wegman and his Weimaraner dogs, Big Bird conducting the Boston Pops, or simply Telly Monster playing a triangle." width="200" /> <em>Sesame Street</em> has operated with a rigorous research standard since its foundation, to ensure that programming addresses its viewers' needs. The Education and Research (E&amp;R) department of Sesame Workshop is currently headed by <a href="Rosemarie_Truglio" title="wikilink">Rosemarie T. Truglio</a>, Ph. D. and <a href="Jeanette_Betancourt" title="wikilink">Jeanette Betancourt</a>, Ed. D. Truglio states that the level of interaction between E&amp;R, Content, and Production is &quot;[i]ntimately&lt;U+00B7&gt;hand-in-hand. They are not creating anything without our knowledge, our guidance and our review. We are involved in content development across all media platforms.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> This close-knit organizational structure has been an integral part of Sesame Workshop since it began.</p>
<p>Writers create plots for <em>Sesame Street</em> scenes and segments, and the content is reviewed by the E&amp;R team, which has authority to reject a script and force rewrites if the content is not acceptable. When a script is factually correct, but includes gray areas that may not be comprehensible to children, the writers and E&amp;R work together to tweak everything. &quot;A balance between content and humor&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> is always pursued, according to Truglio.</p>
<p>In a national study of American mothers with children under age six, 64% responded that they strongly believe <em>Sesame Street</em> is a leader and innovator in educational methods.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Since 1998 Sesame Workshop has provided a great deal of content on its website<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and others such as <a href="Random_House" title="wikilink">Random House</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The content is targeted at parents and children ranging in age from birth to school-age, and includes information on dozens of topics, such as appropriate parenting techniques, dealing with children's fears, development of literacy, and maintenance of good health.</p>
<p>Research is funded by government grants, corporate and private donations (including, recently, The Prudential Foundation for the Sesame Beginnings program), and the profits gained from the sale of Sesame Workshop merchandise.</p>
<h3 id="healthy-habits-for-life">Healthy Habits for Life</h3>
<p>In 2005, <em>Sesame Street</em> launched its <a href="Healthy_Habits_for_Life" title="wikilink">Healthy Habits for Life</a> programming, to encourage young viewers to lead more active and nutritious lifestyles. A major catalyst for this was data published by the US <a href="Centers_for_Disease_Control" title="wikilink">Centers for Disease Control</a> regarding <a href="obesity" class="uri" title="wikilink">obesity</a> in children.</p>
<p>Health content has existed on <em>Sesame Street</em> for years, but to a limited extent. In one instance press kits for a project were made available, news wires latched onto the story, and literally hundreds of newspapers reported that <a href="Cookie_Monster" title="wikilink">Cookie Monster</a> was &quot;going on a diet&quot;. In actuality there was no change to Cookie Monster's character. The new season featured a new segment with rapper <a href="Wyclef_Jean" title="wikilink">Wyclef Jean</a> singing the praises of fruits and vegetables, similar to segments in the 1990s which featured Cookie doing nearly the same.</p>
<p>According to people from Sesame Workshop, </p>
<p>The Workshop formed an Advisory Board consisting of experts such as <a href="Woodie_Kessel" title="wikilink">Woodie Kessel</a>, M.D., M.P.H., the Assistant <a href="Surgeon_General_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Surgeon General of the United States</a>.

Their parents can consult references covering everything from how to comb their baby's hair to how to play with their 4-year-old.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The Web site has been recommended by academic journals.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> It receives over 1 million visitors daily.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="feature-films">Feature films</h3>
<p><img src="Tv_sesame_street_dvd_follow_that_bird.jpg" title="fig:Follow that Bird movie poster." alt="Follow that Bird movie poster." width="200" /> Two feature films based on the series have been made.</p>
<p>Co-produced with <a href="Warner_Bros." title="wikilink">Warner Bros.</a>, the 1985 film <em><a href="Sesame_Street_Presents:_Follow_that_Bird" title="wikilink">Sesame Street Presents: Follow that Bird</a></em> revolved around a social worker forcing Big Bird into adoption. Big Bird gets homesick and tired of his adoptive parents, and heads back to New York, when he is kidnapped by evil carnival leaders (played by <a href="Dave_Thomas_(actor)" title="wikilink">Dave Thomas</a> and <a href="Joe_Flaherty" title="wikilink">Joe Flaherty</a>); the residents of Sesame Street launch a cross-country search to find him.</p>
<p>In the second <em>Sesame Street</em> theatrical film, called <em><a href="The_Adventures_of_Elmo_in_Grouchland" title="wikilink">The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland</a></em>, fourteen years after <em>Follow That Bird</em> in 1999, <a href="Elmo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elmo</a> spends time with his favorite blanket. After <a href="Zoe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zoe</a> accidentally tears the blanket, when Elmo refuses to share, the blanket winds up in <a href="Grouchland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grouchland</a>, ruled by the <a href="Queen_of_Trash" title="wikilink">Queen of Trash</a> (<a href="Vanessa_Williams" title="wikilink">Vanessa Williams</a>). Elmo ventures forth, to rescue his blanket from the villainous <a href="Huxley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Huxley</a> (<a href="Mandy_Patinkin" title="wikilink">Mandy Patinkin</a>). Soon, the rest of the <em>Sesame Street</em> gang follow in pursuit.</p>
<p>According to a rumor posted on /FILM, Elmo has suggested to TVguide.com that <em>Elmo's World</em> might later be turned into a movie. <a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>
<p>Some educators criticized the show when it debuted, feeling that it would only worsen children's attention spans. This concern still exists today, although there is no conclusive proof of this being the case, even after more than 35 seasons of televised shows.</p>
<p>In a letter to the <em>Boston Globe</em>, <a href="Boston_University" title="wikilink">Boston University</a> professor of education Frank Garfunkel commented &quot;If what people want is for their children to memorize numbers and letters without regard to their meaning or use &lt;U+2014&gt; without regard to the differences between children, then <em>Sesame Street</em> is truly responsive. To give a child 30 seconds of one thing and then to switch it and give him 30 seconds of another is to nurture irrelevance.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>In the magazine <em><a href="Childhood_Education" title="wikilink">Childhood Education</a></em>, Minnie P. Berson of <a href="State_University_of_New_York_at_Fredonia" title="wikilink">SUNY Fredonia</a> asked &quot;Why debase the art form of teaching with phony pedagogy, vulgar sideshows, bad acting, and layers of smoke and fog to clog the eager minds of small children?&quot;</p>
<p>For an animation on the letter &quot;J&quot;, the writers included &quot;a day in jail.&quot; This drew criticism from <em><a href="San_Francisco_Chronicle" title="wikilink">San Francisco Chronicle</a></em> columnist <a href="Terrence_O&#39;Flaherty" title="wikilink">Terrence O'Flaherty</a>, despite executive producer David Connell's assertion that kids are familiar with the word through shows like <em><a href="Batman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Batman</a></em> and <em><a href="Superman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Superman</a></em>, and that &quot;when you're trying to come up with a lot of words starting with J, you soon run short&quot; of words they are already familiar with.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>The series also met with criticism in its attempts to help the underprivileged. Educator Sister Mary Mel O'Dowd worried that the show might start to replace &quot;personalized experiences&quot;. &quot;If Sesame Street is the only thing ghetto kids have, I don't think it's going to do much good. It never hurts a child to be able to count to 10 or recognize the 26 letters of the alphabet. But without the guidance of a teacher, he'll be like one of our preschoolers who was able to write 'CAUTION' on the blackboard after seeing it on the back of so many buses, and told me 'That says STOP.'&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Though it is widely beloved, like a number of PBS shows (notably <a href="WGBH" class="uri" title="wikilink">WGBH</a>'s <em><a href="Postcards_From_Buster" title="wikilink">Postcards From Buster</a></em>) <em>Sesame Street</em> has long had to contend with those who disagree with its social content. <a href="Gerald_S._Lesser" title="wikilink">Gerald S. Lesser</a> comments in his book <em>Children and Television: Lessons from Sesame Street</em> that the show faced hostility in the southern United States when it first aired because it portrayed people of various races mingling peacefully. At first the <a href="Commission_for_Educational_Television" title="wikilink">Commission for Educational Television</a> in Mississippi refused to air the show. However, the commission had no choice but to allow their local public television stations to air the show when commercial stations in Mississippi said they would air the program themselves. <a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="rumors-and-urban-legends">Rumors and urban legends</h2>
<p>While many rumors have been started about the series, a few have been widely promulgated and perpetuated over the years.</p>
<p>It has widely been suggested that <a href="Bert_and_Ernie" title="wikilink">Bert and Ernie</a> are a <a href="gay" class="uri" title="wikilink">gay</a> couple, as they are apparently adult human males portrayed sharing a bedroom, though with separate beds. A 1980 collection of humorous essays by <a href="Kurt_Andersen" title="wikilink">Kurt Andersen</a>, titled <em>The Real Thing</em>, made light of the growing rumor. &quot;Bert and Ernie conduct themselves in the same loving, discreet way that millions of gay men, women and hand puppets do. They do their jobs well and live a splendidly settled life together in an impeccably decorated cabinet.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The rumor was promulgated repeatedly, so much so that by 1993, Sesame Workshop had a prepared statement to send out to people inquiring on the topic. In a 1994 effort to get the characters banned, Rev. Joseph Chambers stated on his radio show: &quot;Bert and Ernie are two grown men sharing a house and a bedroom. They share clothes, eat and cook together and have blatantly effeminate characteristics. In one show Bert teaches Ernie how to sew. In another they tend plants together. If this isn't meant to represent a homosexual union, I can't imagine what it's supposed to represent.&quot;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Both Steve Whitmire as Ernie and Eric Jacobson as Bert have stated publicly that the characters are not gay.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> The alleged relationship has been parodied on the adult animated series <em><a href="Family_Guy" title="wikilink">Family Guy</a></em> and by <em><a href="Ernest_&amp;_Bertram" title="wikilink">Ernest &amp; Bertram</a></em>. The latter, a 2002 short film that ran at the <a href="Sundance_Film_Festival" title="wikilink">Sundance Film Festival</a>, was the subject of a cease and desist order from the legal department of Sesame Workshop.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The Broadway musical <em><a href="Avenue_Q" title="wikilink">Avenue Q</a></em> includes two characters similar to Bert and Ernie, who explore the issue of homosexuality.</p>
<p>The pair's relationship bears similarity to that of <a href="Laurel_and_Hardy" title="wikilink">Laurel and Hardy</a>, who were also occasionally shown sleeping together; this became such a comedy staple as to be adopted by <a href="Morecambe_and_Wise" title="wikilink">Morecambe and Wise</a> in the 1970s, all of whom were similarly asexual. <em><a href="The_Odd_Couple" title="wikilink">The Odd Couple</a></em> is another, more apposite, contemporary comparison. Some adult viewers are upset by the assertions, as in their view, Ernie and Bert act like children, teenagers at the oldest, and are no more different than brothers or cousins who share a room.</p>
<p>In 1990, puppeteer <a href="Jim_Henson" title="wikilink">Jim Henson</a>'s death spurred rumors that Ernie would be &quot;killed off&quot; the show, much the way the character of Mr. Hooper was after actor <a href="Will_Lee" title="wikilink">Will Lee</a>'s passing some years earlier. Rumor said that he would be either killed by a vehicle, <a href="AIDS" class="uri" title="wikilink">AIDS</a>, or <a href="cancer" class="uri" title="wikilink">cancer</a>. There was no legitimacy to this rumor, but because producers took their time recasting a puppeteer for Ernie, the delay allowed the claims to burgeon. A spokesperson for the series was quoted as saying &quot;Ernie is not dying of AIDS, Ernie is not dying of leukemia. Ernie is a puppet.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="2002_in_television" title="wikilink">2002</a>, Sesame Workshop announced that an character with <a href="HIV" class="uri" title="wikilink">HIV</a> would be introduced to <em><a href="Takalani_Sesame" title="wikilink">Takalani Sesame</a></em>, the <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South African</a> version of the show. Many conservatives and religious groups wrongly presumed that the American version would be getting a &quot;gay Muppet,&quot; presumably because of the early historical connection between homosexuality and HIV in the U.S., but the character with HIV is only present on this international version of the show. The character, <a href="Kami_(Takalani_Sesame)" title="wikilink">Kami</a>, contracted HIV from a blood transfusion as an infant.</p>
