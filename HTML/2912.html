<p><strong>St Mihangel's Church, Llanfihangel yn Nhowyn</strong>, is a former parish church now used as the chapel for <a href="RAF_Valley" title="wikilink">RAF Valley</a> in <a href="Anglesey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglesey</a>, north Wales. The date of the first church on the site is uncertain, but in 1862 the then-existing church was rebuilt. St Mihangel's became the chapel for the nearby Royal Air Force base in 1998, after the <a href="Church_in_Wales" title="wikilink">Church in Wales</a> had <a href="redundant_church" title="wikilink">ceased using it for services</a>. It was extended for this purpose, by dismantling and reassembling another Anglesey church (<a href="St_Enghenedl&#39;s_Church,_Llanynghenedl" title="wikilink">St Enghenedl's</a>) at the west end of the building.</p>
<p>The church is a <a href="listed_building" title="wikilink">Grade II listed building</a>, a national designation given to &quot;buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them&quot;,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> in particular because it is regarded as &quot;a good example of a mid 19th-century church&quot;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The church contains some stained-glass windows commemorating the work carried out at RAF Valley, including the <a href="RAF_Search_and_Rescue" title="wikilink">RAF Search and Rescue</a> units based there.</p>
<h2 id="history-and-location">History and location</h2>
<p>St Mihangel's Church is set within a gated and walled churchyard at the side of the road in the village of <a href="Llanfihangel_yn_Nhowyn" title="wikilink">Llanfihangel yn Nhowyn</a> in <a href="Anglesey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglesey</a>, north Wales. It is dedicated to <a href="St_Michael" title="wikilink">St Michael</a> ().<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The village, which is about  from the port town of <a href="Holyhead" class="uri" title="wikilink">Holyhead</a> in the north-west of the island, takes its name from the church; the Welsh word  originally meant &quot;enclosure&quot; and then &quot;church&quot;, and &quot;&lt;U+2011&gt;fihangel&quot; is a <a href="Colloquial_Welsh_morphology" title="wikilink">modified form</a> of the saint's name.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The date of the first church on this site is unknown; writing in 1833, the antiquarian <a href="Angharad_Llwyd" title="wikilink">Angharad Llwyd</a> described the church then on the site as &quot;an ancient and venerable structure&quot; that formed &quot;a conspicuous and interesting object for many miles round.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> St Mihangel's was largely rebuilt in 1862 by Henry Kennedy, architect of the <a href="Diocese_of_Bangor" title="wikilink">Diocese of Bangor</a>; some of the earlier building, especially the east end, was reused in Kennedy's church.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <a href="St_Enghenedl&#39;s_Church,_Llanynghenedl" title="wikilink">St Enghenedl's Church, Llanynghenedl</a> (a disused Anglesey church) was dismantled and &quot;faithfully reassembled&quot; at the west end of St Mihangel's in 1988,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> to allow the building to serve as the chapel for <a href="RAF_Valley" title="wikilink">RAF Valley</a>, a nearby Royal Air Force base. The orientation of St Enghenedl's was reversed in the process; its former west end was joined to the west end of Kennedy's building, therefore St Enghenedl's east end now faces west. The work was carried out by D of E Property Services Agency.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="architecture-and-fittings">Architecture and fittings</h2>
<p>Writing in 1847, before Kennedy's rebuilding, the clergyman and antiquarian <a href="Harry_Longueville_Jones" title="wikilink">Harry Longueville Jones</a> described the church as small ( long,  wide and  high) and of early <a href="English_Gothic_architecture#Perpendicular_Gothic" title="wikilink">Perpendicular</a> character. He said that the east window had a &quot;peculiar&quot; design, in that there was a shield-shaped section of window above and between the two main sections, perhaps designed to display a coat of arms.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The present building is rectangular, using <a href="rubble_masonry" title="wikilink">rubble masonry</a> dressed with freestone; the roof uses slates and stone <a href="Coping_(architecture)" title="wikilink">copings</a>. The 19th-century part of the church is wider and higher than the 1988 extension. The <a href="bellcote" class="uri" title="wikilink">bellcote</a> is in the middle of the roof, at the join between the two sections. There is an annexe including a vestry at the western end of the north side of the extension. The <a href="nave" class="uri" title="wikilink">nave</a> has three bays and the roof timbers are exposed. The sanctuary is marked off by a step and a rail, and there is a 17th-century gravestone set into the floor in front of the sanctuary. The extension has two bays, and the two parts are divided by an arcade of three round arches.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The church and annexe have separate entrances.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

The north wall has three windows, one with a single light (or section) and two with pairs of lights; there are two windows on the south wall (one with three lights, another with two) as well as a blocked window at the east end of the wall. The church's east window is a pointed arch with a lower section of three trefoil-headed lights and two smaller lights on top. The windows in the extension are set into pointed arches.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Most of the windows contain clear leaded glass, but some have stained glass.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In 2010, a two-panel stained glass window depicting the work of the <a href="RAF_Search_and_Rescue" title="wikilink">RAF Search and Rescue</a> units at RAF Valley was dedicated by the <a href="Royal_Air_Force_Chaplains_Branch" title="wikilink">RAF's Chaplain-in-Chief</a>, <a href="Ray_Pentland" title="wikilink">Ray Pentland</a>. The window, which also commemorates the work of the <a href="Royal_National_Lifeboat_Institute" title="wikilink">Royal National Lifeboat Institute</a> and the <a href="Royal_Air_Force_Mountain_Rescue_Service" title="wikilink">RAF Mountain Rescue Service</a>, was created by Karen Newby &lt;U+2013&gt; wife of a former RAF Valley station commander &lt;U+2013&gt; and Lindsey Abbott.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Karen Newby also designed a window dedicated in 2001 to mark the work of <a href="No._208_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">208 Squadron</a> at RAF Valley.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Another stained glass window was added in 2012 to mark the 100th anniversary of <a href="No._4_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">4 Squadron</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>A 1937 survey by the <a href="Royal_Commission_on_Ancient_and_Historical_Monuments_in_Wales_and_Monmouthshire" title="wikilink">Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire</a> noted a rectangular font made of gritstone, of unknown date, and a memorial to a Sion Evan and his son Evan Jones, who died in 1790 and 1822 respectively.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> A survey of church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 recorded a chalice and <a href="paten" class="uri" title="wikilink">paten</a> made of <a href="Britannia_metal" title="wikilink">Britannia metal</a> (a pewter alloy), and an electro-plated set of communion vessels. It noted that the old silver communion service had been stolen.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>St Mihangel's has national recognition and statutory protection from unauthorised alteration as it has been designated a Grade II <a href="listed_building" title="wikilink">listed building</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating &quot;buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> It was given this status on 5 April 1971, and has been listed because it is regarded as &quot;a good example of a mid 19th-century church, built as part of a programme of reconstruction and restoration of Anglesey churches&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> <a href="Cadw" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cadw</a> (the <a href="Welsh_Government" title="wikilink">Welsh Government</a> body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) also notes &quot;the simplicity of its design, complementing the local late medieval idiom typical of the island.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
