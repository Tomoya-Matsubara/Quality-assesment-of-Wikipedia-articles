<h3 id="chicago-cubs">Chicago Cubs</h3>
<p>On December 7, 2005, the Marlins traded Pierre to the <a href="Chicago_Cubs" title="wikilink">Chicago Cubs</a>, receiving <a href="pitcher" title="wikilink">pitchers</a> <a href="Sergio_Mitre" title="wikilink">Sergio Mitre</a>, <a href="Ricky_Nolasco" title="wikilink">Ricky Nolasco</a>, and <a href="Renyel_Pinto" title="wikilink">Renyel Pinto</a> in exchange. The deal was motivated by the Marlins' need to cut payroll after finding itself unable to secure a new stadium deal in <a href="South_Florida" title="wikilink">South Florida</a>.</p>
<p>In 2006, despite batting only .292, Pierre led the NL with 204 hits, winning his second hit title, and in at-bats (699), games played (162), bunt hits (21), infield hits (30),<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and in lowest strikeout percentage (5.4%).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> He also played perfect defensive baseball, earning a <a href="fielding_percentage" title="wikilink">fielding percentage</a> of 1.000. However, he also led the major leagues in outs made (532), the second-highest out total for a player since .</p>
<h3 id="los-angeles-dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</h3>
<p>On November 22, 2006, Pierre signed a $44 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>
<p><img src="Ethier_Andruw_Pierre.jpg" title="fig:Pierre (right) with Dodgers teammates Andre Ethier and Andruw Jones in 2008." alt="Pierre (right) with Dodgers teammates Andre Ethier and Andruw Jones in 2008." /> In , Pierre led the majors in bunt hits (19). He also led the NL in games played (162) for the 5th straight year, and <a href="Single_(baseball)" title="wikilink">singles</a> (164) for the second straight year, led the league in sacrifice hits (20), and had the lowest strikeout percentage in the NL (5.5%),<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>. He was 2nd in the NL in stolen bases (64), 3rd in at bats (668) and plate appearances (729), 4th in hits (196), and 9th in triples (8).</p>
<p>Going into , the Dodgers signed <a href="Andruw_Jones" title="wikilink">Andruw Jones</a> to a two-year contract to play center field. Because of this, Pierre shifted to <a href="left_fielder" title="wikilink">left field</a>. After a trip to the <a href="Disabled_list" title="wikilink">DL</a> in July, Pierre was moved into a platoon in center field with the struggling Jones. When the Dodgers traded for <a href="Manny_Ramirez" title="wikilink">Manny Ramirez</a>, Pierre moved to the bench and saw limited action, primarily as a pinch runner the rest of the season.</p>
<p>After nearly 2 years without hitting a home run, Pierre hit a ball into the right field seats at <a href="PNC_Park" title="wikilink">PNC Park</a> in <a href="Pittsburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh</a> on September 15, 2008. It was Pierre's first traditional fly ball home run since August 28, 2006, also in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Pierre became a fan favorite early in his career because of his speed, durability, and work ethic. He led the <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> in stolen bases in  and , and stole at least 45 bases each year from 2001 to 2006; because of his great speed and ability for <a href="contact_hitter" title="wikilink">contact hitting</a>, many believe he is one of the best <a href="leadoff_batter" title="wikilink">leadoff</a> hitters in baseball. Critics are quick to point out that, in contrast to a prototypical leadoff hitter, Pierre rarely <a href="Base_on_balls" title="wikilink">walks</a> and must hit for a high average to sustain a high <a href="on-base_percentage" title="wikilink">on-base percentage</a>, which Pierre has not accomplished since . His <a href="slugging_percentage" title="wikilink">slugging percentage</a> is also below average due to his inability to collect <a href="extra-base_hit" title="wikilink">extra-base hits</a>. His most glaring weakness is his lack of <a href="home_run" title="wikilink">home runs</a>, with only 12 for his entire career and with two different seasons of none whatsoever.</p>
