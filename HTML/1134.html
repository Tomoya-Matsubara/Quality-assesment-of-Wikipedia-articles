<p><strong>Thurman Lowell Tucker</strong> (September 26, 1917 May 7, 1993) was an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="center_fielder" title="wikilink">center fielder</a> in <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> who played for nine seasons in the <a href="American_League" title="wikilink">American League</a> with the <a href="Chicago_White_Sox" title="wikilink">Chicago White Sox</a> and <a href="Cleveland_Indians" title="wikilink">Cleveland Indians</a>. In 701 career games, Tucker recorded a <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">batting average</a> of .255 and accumulated 24 <a href="triple_(baseball)" title="wikilink">triples</a>, 9 <a href="home_run" title="wikilink">home runs</a>, and 179 <a href="runs_batted_in" title="wikilink">runs batted in</a> (RBI). He was nicknamed &quot;Joe E.&quot; Tucker because of his resemblance to comedian <a href="Joe_E._Brown" title="wikilink">Joe E. Brown</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Born and raised in Texas, Tucker first played professionally with the <a href="Siloam_Springs_Travelers" title="wikilink">Siloam Springs Travelers</a>. After gradually progressing through minor league baseball, he was signed by the Chicago White Sox before the 1941 season. His major league debut came the following year and he spent two years as the White Sox's starting center fielder until he enlisted in the armed forces during World War II. Upon his return, Tucker played two more seasons for the White Sox. Subsequently, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians, for whom he played four years, and continued to play minor league baseball throughout the 1950s. After his retirement, he became a major league scout and insurance agent.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Thurman Tucker was born on September 26, 1917 and raised in <a href="Gordon,_Texas" title="wikilink">Gordon, Texas</a>. In high school, he was a three-sport athlete, playing baseball (where he was a <a href="second_baseman" title="wikilink">second baseman</a>), <a href="basketball" class="uri" title="wikilink">basketball</a>, and <a href="track_and_field" title="wikilink">track and field</a>. After graduating in 1935, he played semi-professional baseball and enrolled in a baseball school located in <a href="Hot_Springs,_Arkansas" title="wikilink">Hot Springs, Arkansas</a>. In 1936 at age 18, Tucker signed as a professional with the <a href="Fayetteville_Bears" title="wikilink">Fayetteville Bears</a> of the <a href="Arkansas-Missouri_League" title="wikilink">Arkansas-Missouri League</a>, but left the team after only two weeks, without playing a game. Soon after, he was signed by the <a href="Siloam_Springs_Travelers" title="wikilink">Siloam Springs Travelers</a> of the same league, where he began his professional career.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="minor-league-career">Minor league career</h2>
<p>In 1936, his first season with the Travelers, Tucker changed fielding positions and became an outfielder.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In 117 games, he had a .319 <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">batting average</a> and 25 <a href="double_(baseball)" title="wikilink">doubles</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The following year, he was to play for the <a href="El_Dorado_Lions" title="wikilink">El Dorado Lions</a> of the <a href="Cotton_States_League" title="wikilink">Cotton States League</a>, but a back injury caused him to miss nearly the entire season.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> After recovering from the injury, Tucker continued to progress through the minors, spending 1938 with two separate clubs; he played 55 games for the <a href="Abbeville_A&#39;s" title="wikilink">Abbeville A's</a> of the <a href="Evangeline_Baseball_League" title="wikilink">Evangeline Baseball League</a> and 50 games for the <a href="Greenville_Bucks" title="wikilink">Greenville Bucks</a> of the Cotton States League.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He remained in the Cotton States League for 1939, playing for the <a href="Clarksdale_Red_Sox" title="wikilink">Clarksdale Red Sox</a>, at the time a minor league affiliate of the <a href="Boston_Red_Sox" title="wikilink">Boston Red Sox</a>. In 136 games for Clarksdale, Tucker had a .298 batting average and 10 <a href="triple_(baseball)" title="wikilink">triples</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> During his first few years in the minor leagues, one manager asked him to take up <a href="clowning" class="uri" title="wikilink">clowning</a> due to his resemblance to <a href="Joe_E._Brown" title="wikilink">Joe E. Brown</a> and his nickname as a result, Joe E. Tucker objected due to his serious nature and the idea was later dropped.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Tucker's breakthrough minor league year came in 1940, his second with Clarksdale. By the end of June, he was leading the Cotton State League with a batting average of .374.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> After playing in 97 games, finishing with an average of .390, Tucker was promoted and played in 40 games for the <a href="Oklahoma_City_Indians" title="wikilink">Oklahoma City Indians</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> At the end of the season, Chicago White Sox <a href="farm_team" title="wikilink">farm</a> manager Billy Webb was impressed enough to purchase Tucker's contract from Oklahoma City.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> At the beginning of the 1941 season, Tucker failed to win the final outfield spot on the White Sox roster from <a href="Dave_Short" title="wikilink">Dave Short</a>,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and consequently spent 1941 at Oklahoma City, where he was coached by <a href="Rogers_Hornsby" title="wikilink">Rogers Hornsby</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In 141 games for the Indians, Tucker had a batting average of .246 and 12 triples.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>At spring training for the 1942 season, Tucker competed against <a href="Dave_Philley" title="wikilink">Dave Philley</a> for the final outfield spot.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> White Sox management liked Tucker's defensive abilities, leading to them adding Tucker to their 1942 major league roster; Tucker made his major league debut on April 14, 1942.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> After playing two games for the White Sox, Tucker was sent down to the <a href="Fort_Worth_Cats_(Texas_League)" title="wikilink">Fort Worth Cats</a> of the <a href="Texas_League" title="wikilink">Texas League</a>,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> where he spent most of the season and hit .313 in 144 games.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> When the minor league season ended, Tucker returned to the major league squad, and finished the year having played seven games for the White Sox.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="chicago-white-sox">Chicago White Sox</h2>
<p>Of the Chicago White Sox outfielders at the beginning of the 1943 season, only <a href="Wally_Moses" title="wikilink">Wally Moses</a> was assured of a place on the team. During spring training, manager <a href="Jimmy_Dykes" title="wikilink">Jimmy Dykes</a> was impressed by Tucker, who was competing for the starting center fielder position alongside <a href="Moose_Solters" title="wikilink">Moose Solters</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Consequently, after spring training Tucker became the starting center fielder for 1943, and the team's <a href="leadoff_hitter" title="wikilink">leadoff hitter</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Partway through the season, Tucker's performance caught the eye of American League President <a href="Will_Harridge" title="wikilink">Will Harridge</a>, who noted him as someone the public came out to watch in the absence of stars serving in World War II.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Among Tucker's achievements during the year were a <a href="walk-off_home_run" title="wikilink">walk-off home run</a> on July 26 to win a game against the <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a> 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Tucker finished the season with a .235 batting average, six triples, and 79 <a href="base_on_balls" title="wikilink">walks</a> in 135 games. He also stole 29 bases, the third best total in the AL, and was caught stealing 17 times, which was second in the league.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Tucker passed a physical examination for the <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">United States Navy</a> before the 1944 season began. Although expected to be called up to serve in the war that year,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> he was able to play the entire season for the White Sox. Tucker hit very well during the first month of 1944; he had a .403 batting average on May 16, which led the American League.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> His hitting and fielding abilities impressed critics: sportswriter <a href="Fred_Lieb" title="wikilink">Fred Lieb</a> noted him as a breakout performer that year,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> and manager Jimmy Dykes called Tucker the finest defensive outfielder in the American League.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Tucker and <a href="Dixie_Walker" title="wikilink">Dixie Walker</a> led their respective leagues in batting average throughout June; at the end of the month, Tucker had an average of .369 in the American League while Walker had an average of .377 in the National League.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Owing to his achievements, Tucker was added to the 1944 <a href="Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game" title="wikilink">All-Star</a> roster for the only time in his career.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> He was the leadoff hitter in the <a href="1944_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game" title="wikilink">1944 Major League Baseball All-Star Game</a>, but went hitless in four at-bats.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Tucker's form faded after the All-Star Game; in early July, he had a hitless streak of 28 at-bats, causing his batting average to shrink from .375 to .327, resulting in losing his status as league leader.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> When his average fell to .320 after recording one base hit in 35 at-bats, he was removed from the starting lineup for a weekend matchup against the <a href="Detroit_Tigers" title="wikilink">Detroit Tigers</a> in an attempt to halt his decline.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Tucker returned to the starting lineup shortly after being removed, and finished the season with a batting average of .287 and six triples.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> At the end of July that season, both Tucker and <a href="George_Case" title="wikilink">George Case</a> participated in a 75-yard dash as part of the White Sox's annual benefit for the war effort; Tucker lost the race to Case by a yard.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> After the season ended, Tucker formally joined the Navy, and spent the 1945 season serving in the war.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>When the players returned to their teams at the end of the war, Tucker was slated to be the starting center fielder for the 1946 season, working alongside Wally Moses and <a href="Taffy_Wright" title="wikilink">Taffy Wright</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Unlike the previous season, he struggled with the bat at first, and was relegated to his original status on the White Sox roster as a good fielder but a poor hitter.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> At the end of June, Tucker had a batting average of .229, nearly 150 points lower than his average at the same point in 1944.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> His form recovered in the second half of the season and he finished the year with a batting average of .288 and 20 doubles, both career highs.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> As the <a href="1947_Chicago_White_Sox_season" title="wikilink">1947 Chicago White Sox season</a> began, Tucker remained in his center field position after hitting .400 in the last month of the 1946 season, while rookie Dave Philley played in left field and Taffy Wright and <a href="Bob_Kennedy" title="wikilink">Bob Kennedy</a> <a href="platoon_system" title="wikilink">platooned</a> in right field.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> However, he started the year by missing some playing time due to a stomach ailment, and did not play regularly for the White Sox until the middle of May.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> After returning to regular play, Tucker alternated playing time with Philley, and he finished the season with a .236 batting average in 89 games.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>On January 27, 1948, Tucker was traded to the <a href="Cleveland_Indians" title="wikilink">Cleveland Indians</a> for <a href="Ralph_Weigel" title="wikilink">Ralph Weigel</a>; the Indians front office regarded Tucker as &quot;the finest defensive player in baseball.&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> He started off the year as the starting center fielder for the Indians, and in one early matchup against the Detroit Tigers, was the only player not to record a hit in an 8&lt;U+2013&gt;2 victory.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> He missed three weeks of playing time in June after breaking a finger when he was hit by a pitch.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Upon returning to the lineup, Tucker spent most of the second half of the season as a <a href="fourth_outfielder" title="wikilink">fourth outfielder</a>, splitting time with <a href="Allie_Clark" title="wikilink">Allie Clark</a> and playing in the outfield alongside <a href="Larry_Doby" title="wikilink">Larry Doby</a> and <a href="Dale_Mitchell_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Dale Mitchell</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> He finished the season with a .260 batting average and 52 runs in 83 games, and ended the season with a perfect <a href="fielding_percentage" title="wikilink">fielding percentage</a> of 1.000.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Tucker participated in game six of the <a href="1948_World_Series" title="wikilink">1948 World Series</a>, scoring a run in the sixth inning on a <a href="base_on_balls" title="wikilink">walk</a> en route to a 4&lt;U+2013&gt;3 win for the Indians.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>The Indians planned to use Tucker as their fourth outfielder for the 1949 season when he served mostly as backup to Doby.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> He was relegated mostly to <a href="pinch_hitting" title="wikilink">pinch hitting</a> duties, and finished the season with a .244 batting average in 20 games and under 200 at-bats.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Due to his hitting struggles, Indians manager <a href="Lou_Boudreau" title="wikilink">Lou Boudreau</a> tried converting Tucker to a <a href="switch_hitter" title="wikilink">switch hitter</a> to start off the 1950 season.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Tucker was again set to be a backup outfielder in 1950.

<p>Tucker and Allie Clark both attempted to make the Indians roster to begin the 1951 season, as the additions of <a href="Harry_Simpson" title="wikilink">Harry Simpson</a> and <a href="Minnie_Mi&lt;U+00F1&gt;oso" title="wikilink">Minnie Mi&lt;U+00F1&gt;oso</a> made it likely that one or both of them would be traded or released.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Tucker played only one game for the Indians, on April 29 when he recorded a strikeout in his lone at-bat.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> In early May, the Indians sent him to their <a href="Minor_league_baseball#Triple-A" title="wikilink">Triple-A minor league affiliate</a>, the <a href="San_Diego_Padres_(PCL)" title="wikilink">San Diego Padres</a> of the <a href="Pacific_Coast_League" title="wikilink">Pacific Coast League</a>; his last major league game was April 29.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
