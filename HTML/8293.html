<p><strong>Female genital mutilation</strong> (<strong>FGM</strong>), also known as <strong>female genital cutting</strong> and <strong>female circumcision</strong>, is the ritual removal of some or all of the external female genitalia. Typically carried out by a traditional circumciser with a blade or razor, with or without anaesthesia, FGM is concentrated in 27 countries in Africa, as well as in Yemen and Iraqi Kurdistan, and practised to a lesser extent elsewhere in Asia and among diaspora communities around the world.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The age at which it is conducted varies from days after birth to puberty; in half the countries for which national figures are available, most girls are cut before the age of five.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The procedures differ according to the ethnic group. They include removal of the <a href="clitoral_hood" title="wikilink">clitoral hood</a> and <a href="clitoris" class="uri" title="wikilink">clitoris</a>, and in the most severe form (known as <a href="#Type_III" title="wikilink">infibulation</a>) removal of the <a href="Labia_minora" title="wikilink">inner</a> and <a href="Labia_majora" title="wikilink">outer labia</a> and closure of the <a href="vulva" class="uri" title="wikilink">vulva</a>; in this last procedure, a small hole is left for the passage of urine and menstrual blood, and the <a href="vagina" class="uri" title="wikilink">vagina</a> is opened for intercourse and childbirth. Health effects depend on the procedure, but can include recurrent infections, chronic pain, cysts, an inability to get pregnant, complications during childbirth and fatal bleeding.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> There are no known health benefits.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The practice is rooted in gender inequality, attempts to control women's sexuality, and ideas about purity, modesty and aesthetics. It is initiated and usually carried out by women, who see it as a source of honour, and who fear that failing to have their daughters and granddaughters cut will expose the girls to social exclusion.<ref><a href="http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf">UNICEF 2013</a>, p. 15: &quot;There is a social obligation to conform to the practice and a widespread belief that if they [families] do not, they are likely to pay a price that could include social exclusion, criticism, ridicule, stigma or the inability to find their daughters suitable marriage partners.&quot;</p>

This shift in emphasis has helped redefine the issues from a clinical disease model (hence the terminology of eradication prevalent in the literature) to a problem resulting from the use of culture to protect social dominance over women's bodies by the patriarchal hierarchy. Understanding the operative mechanisms of patriarchal dominance must also include understanding how women, particularly older married women, are important keepers of that social hegemony.&quot;  </ref> Over 125 million women and girls have experienced FGM in the 29 countries in which it is concentrated.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Over eight million have been infibulated, a practice found largely in Djibouti, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>FGM has been outlawed or restricted in most of the countries in which it occurs, but the laws are poorly enforced.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> There have been international efforts since the 1970s to persuade practitioners to abandon it, and in 2012 the <a href="United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="wikilink">United Nations General Assembly</a>, recognizing FGM as a human-rights violation, voted unanimously to intensify those efforts.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The opposition is not without its critics, particularly among anthropologists. <a href="Eric_Silverman" title="wikilink">Eric Silverman</a> writes that FGM has become one of anthropology's central moral topics, raising difficult questions about cultural relativism, tolerance and the universality of human rights.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>The procedures are generally performed by a traditional circumciser in the girls' homes, with or without anaesthesia. The circumciser is usually an older woman; in communities where the male <a href="Barber#History" title="wikilink">barber</a> has assumed the role of health worker, he will perform FGM too.<ref><a href="http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf">UNICEF 2013</a>, pp. 42&lt;U+2013&gt;44 and Table 5, p. 181 (for cutters), p. 46 (for home and anaesthesia).</p>

This is true for over 80 percent of the girls who undergo the practice in Benin, Burkina Faso, C&lt;U+00F4&gt;te d'Ivoire, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Tanzania and Yemen. In most countries, medical personnel, including doctors, nurses and certified midwives, are not widely involved in the practice.&quot;</ref> In Egypt, Sudan and Kenya, FGM is carried out by health professionals; surveys in Egypt in 1997&lt;U+2013&gt;2011 indicated that 77 percent of FGM procedures were performed by medical professionals, often physicians.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>The WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA issued a joint statement in April 1997 defining female genital mutilation as &quot;all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs whether for cultural or other non-therapeutic reasons.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The procedures vary considerably according to ethnicity and individual practitioners. English terms do not always correspond with local ones; in a survey in Niger in 1998, women responded with 50 different terms when asked what was done to them.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf">UNICEF 2013</a>, p. 48.</ref> Translation problems are compounded by the women's confusion over which type of FGM they experienced, or even whether they experienced it. A study in Ghana in 2003 found that women had changed their responses during surveys; when asked if they had undergone FGM, four percent said no in 1995 but yes in 2000, and 11 percent switched in the other direction. In Tanzania in 2005, 66 percent reported FGM, but a medical exam found that 73 percent had undergone it.<ref>P.

<p>The WHO has created a more detailed typology that describes how much tissue was removed. The WHO categories are Types I&lt;U+2013&gt;III, and Type IV for symbolic circumcision and miscellaneous procedures.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Type I is subdivided into Ia, the removal of the clitoral hood (rarely, if ever performed alone),<ref><a href="http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596442_eng.pdf">WHO 2008</a>, p. 25: &quot;[There is a] common tendency to describe Type I as removal of the prepuce, whereas this has not been documented as a traditional form of female genital mutilation. However, in some countries, medicalized female genital mutilation can include removal of the prepuce only (Type Ia) (Thabet and Thabet, 2003), but this form appears to be relatively rare (Satti et al, 2006). Almost all known forms of female genital mutilation that remove tissue from the clitoris also cut all or part of the clitoral glans itself.&quot;</p>

In addition to reinfibulation, many women in Sudan undergo a second type of re-suturing called El-Adel, which is performed to recreate the size of the vaginal orifice to be similar to the size created at the time of primary infibulation. Two small cuts are made around the vaginal orifice to expose new tissues to suture, and then sutures are placed to tighten the vaginal orifice and perineum. This procedure, also called re-circumcision, is primarily performed after vaginal delivery, but can also be performed before marriage, after cesarean section, after divorce, and sometimes even in elderly women as a preparation before death.&quot;</p>

<p>The penetration of the bride's infibulation takes anywhere from 3 or 4 days to several months. Some men are unable to penetrate their wives at all (in my study over 15%), and the task is often accomplished by a midwife under conditions of great secrecy, since this reflects negatively on the man's potency. Some who are unable to penetrate their wives manage to get them pregnant in spite of the infibulation, and the woman's vaginal passage is then cut open to allow birth to take place. ... Those men who do manage to penetrate their wives do so often, or perhaps always, with the help of the &quot;little knife.&quot; This creates a tear which they gradually rip more and more until the opening is sufficient to admit the penis.<ref>Hanny Lightfoot-Klein, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3812643">&quot;The Sexual Experience and Marital Adjustment of Genitally Circumcised and Infibulated Females in The Sudan&quot;</a>, <em>The Journal of Sex Research</em>, 26(3), 1989 (pp. 375&lt;U+2013&gt;392), p. 380.</p>

The girl is instructed to pull her genitalia every day, to stretch them further, and to put additional sticks in to hold the stretched parts from time to time.

<h3 id="complications">Complications</h3>
<p>FGM has no known health benefits.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The immediate, short-term and late <a href="complication_(medicine)" title="wikilink">complications</a> depend on several factors, principally the type of FGM performed. Factors include whether the practitioner had medical training, whether unsterilized or surgical single-use instruments were used, whether surgical thread was used instead of agave or acacia thorns, and whether antibiotics were available. In the case of Type III, other factors include how small a hole was left for the passage of urine and menstrual blood, and whether the procedure was performed more than once (for example, to close an opening regarded as too wide or re-open one too small).<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p>Immediate complications include fatal bleeding, <a href="anaemia" class="uri" title="wikilink">anaemia</a>, acute <a href="urinary_retention" title="wikilink">urinary retention</a>, <a href="urinary_infection" title="wikilink">urinary infection</a>, <a href="wound_infection" title="wikilink">wound infection</a>, <a href="septicemia" class="uri" title="wikilink">septicemia</a>, <a href="tetanus" class="uri" title="wikilink">tetanus</a>, and transmission of <a href="hepatitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">hepatitis</a> or <a href="HIV" class="uri" title="wikilink">HIV</a> if instruments are non-sterile or reused.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Because fatalities are rarely reported &lt;U+2013&gt; few records are kept and complications may not be recognized &lt;U+2013&gt; it is not known how many girls and women die.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Short-term complications include <a href="necrotizing_fasciitis" title="wikilink">necrotizing fasciitis</a> (flesh-eating disease), delay in wound healing due to infection, <a href="endometritis" class="uri" title="wikilink">endometritis</a> and hepatitis.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Late complications vary depending on the type of FGM performed. Jasmine Abdulcadir, a Swiss gynaecologist who offers specialist services to women with FGM, writes that a common complication with infibulation is <a href="dysmenorrhea" title="wikilink">painful periods</a>, because the menstrual flow has been obstructed. Blood can collect and stagnate in the vagina and uterus. There may be difficult and <a href="dysuria" title="wikilink">painful urination</a>; urine may collect underneath the scar and cause small stones to form. In an infibulated virgin the opening is 2&lt;U+2013&gt;3 mm; in women who are sexually active or have given birth by vaginal delivery, the hole is larger but the urethra opening may still be obstructed by scar tissue.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> There may be damage to the urethra and bladder, leading to infections and incontinence, <a href="dyspareunia" title="wikilink">pain during sexual intercourse</a> and <a href="infertility" class="uri" title="wikilink">infertility</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Other complications include <a href="epidermoid_cyst" title="wikilink">epidermoid cysts</a> that may become infected, and <a href="neuroma" class="uri" title="wikilink">neuroma</a> formation (growth of nerve tissue) involving nerves that supplied the clitoris.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

Over 80 percent of girls who experience FGM are cut before that age in Nigeria, Mali, Eritrea, Ghana and Mauritania.

<p>In Kenya and Tanzania, women aged 45&lt;U+2013&gt;49 years were three times more likely to have been cut than the 15&lt;U+2013&gt;19 cohort. In Benin, Central African Republic, Iraq, Liberia and Nigeria the figure for the 15&lt;U+2013&gt;19 group had dropped by about half.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Prevalence rates in Chad, Djibouti, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen remained roughly the same.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> If the rate of decline continues, the number of women and girls affected by FGM in the key 29 countries will have increased by 2050 from 125 million to 196 million because of population growth.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>

<p>Women who respond to surveys on FGM are reporting events experienced years ago, so prevalence figures for the 15&lt;U+2013&gt;49 group do not reflect current trends.<ref><a href="http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf">UNICEF 2013</a>, p. 85. Also see p. 113.</p>
<p>For example, UNICEF writes (p. 85), in Mauritania, where the mean age at cutting is one month old, the 15&lt;U+2013&gt;19 cohort are reporting events from 15&lt;U+2013&gt;19 years ago, whereas in Egypt, where the mean age is 10 years, the cutting for the same group occurred 5&lt;U+2013&gt;9 years ago.</ref> UNICEF bases its figures on the 15&lt;U+2013&gt;49 group because it regards girls as at risk until they are 14.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> An additional complication in judging prevalence among the younger group is that, in countries with campaigns against FGM, women might not report that their daughters have been cut.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2011 the DHS and MICS surveys began asking women about the FGM status of all their living daughters.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> The surveys suggested a prevalence for the 0&lt;U+2013&gt;14 age group of 0.3 percent in Benin at the lowest (7 percent for the 15&lt;U+2013&gt;49 group) to 56 percent in Gambia (76 percent for 15&lt;U+2013&gt;49).<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>In a study in Egypt in 2008&lt;U+2013&gt;2010 (FGM was banned there by decree in 2007 and criminalized in 2008), 4,158 women and girls aged 5&lt;U+2013&gt;25, who presented to three departments at <a href="Sohag" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sohag</a> and <a href="Qena" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qena</a> University Hospitals, replied to an oral questionnaire about FGM, along with their parents. According to the researchers, the most common form of FGM in Egypt is Type I. The study found that, between 2000 and 2009, 3,711 of the subjects had undergone FGM, giving a prevalence rate of 89.2 percent. The <a href="Incidence_(epidemiology)" title="wikilink">incidence</a> rate was 9.6 percent in 2000. It began to fall in 2006, and by 2009 had declined to 7.7 percent. After 2007 most of the procedures were conducted by general practitioners; the researchers suggested that the criminalization of FGM had deterred gynaecologists, so general practitioners were doing it instead.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reasons">Reasons</h2>
<h3 id="support-from-women">Support from women</h3>
<p>Dahabo Musa, a Somali woman, described infibulation in a 1988 poem as the &quot;three feminine sorrows&quot;: the procedure itself, the wedding night when the woman is cut open, then childbirth when she is cut again.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Despite the evident suffering, it is women who organize all forms of FGM, including infibulation. Anthropologist Rose Oldfield Hayes wrote in 1975 that educated Sudanese men living in cities who did not want their daughters to be infibulated (preferring clitoridectomy) would find the girls had been sewn up after their grandmothers arranged a visit to relatives.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Gerry Mackie compares FGM to <a href="footbinding" class="uri" title="wikilink">footbinding</a>; like FGM, footbinding was an ethnic marker carried out on young girls, nearly universal where practised, tied to ideas about honour, chastity and appropriate marriage, and supported by women.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>


<p>Practitioners see the procedures as marking not only community boundaries but also gender difference; FGM demasculinizes women and male circumcision defeminizes men.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> <a href="Fuambai_Ahmadu" title="wikilink">Fuambai Ahmadu</a>, an anthropologist and member of the <a href="Kono_people" title="wikilink">Kono people</a> of Sierra Leone, who underwent clitoridectomy as an adult during a <a href="Sande_society" title="wikilink">Sande society</a> initiation, argues that the idea of the clitoris being important to female sexuality is a male-centred assumption. African female symbolism revolves instead around the concept of the womb.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Infibulation draws on that idea of enclosure and fertility. &quot;[G]enital cutting completes the social definition of a child's sex by eliminating external traces of androgyny,&quot; writes <a href="Janice_Boddy" title="wikilink">Janice Boddy</a>. &quot;The female body is then covered, closed, and its productive blood bound within; the male body is unveiled, opened and exposed.&quot;<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>In communities were infibulation is common, there is a preference for women's genitals to be smooth, dry and without odour, and both women and men may find the natural vulva repulsive.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Men also seem to enjoy the effort of penetrating an infibulation.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> There is also a belief, because of the smooth appearance of an infibulated vulva, that infibulation increases hygiene.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Women regularly introduce substances into the vagina to <a href="Dry_sex" title="wikilink">reduce lubrication</a>, including leaves, tree bark, toothpaste and Vicks menthol rub, a practice the WHO includes within Type IV FGM; the added friction during intercourse can cause lacerations and increased risk of infection.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>Common reasons for FGM cited by women in surveys are social acceptance, religion, hygiene, preservation of virginity, marriageability and enhancement of male sexual pleasure.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> In a study in northern Sudan, published in 1983, only 558 (17.4 percent) of 3,210 women opposed FGM, and most preferred excision and infibulation over clitoridectomy.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Attitudes are slowly changing; 48 percent of women in Sudan in 2010 who had heard of FGM said the practice should continue.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> In surveys in 2010&lt;U+2013&gt;2011, over 50 percent of women in Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Gambia and Egypt supported FGM's continuance, while elsewhere in Africa, Iraq and Yemen most said it should end, though in several countries only by a narrow margin.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>

<p>Against the argument that women willingly choose FGM for their daughters, UNICEF calls the practice a &quot;self-enforcing social convention&quot; to which families feel they must conform to avoid uncut daughters facing social exclusion.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Ellen_Gruenbaum" title="wikilink">Ellen Gruenbaum</a> reports that, in the 1970s, cut girls from an Arab ethnic group in Sudan would mock uncut girls from the <a href="Zarma_people" title="wikilink">Zabarma people</a>, shouting at them <em>Ya, Ghalfa!</em> (&quot;Hey, unclean!&quot;). The Zabarma girls would respond with their own taunt, <em>Ya, mutmura!</em> (a <em>mutmara</em> was a storage pit for grain that was continually opened and closed, like an infibulated woman). But the Zabarma girls felt the pressure, asking their mothers, &quot;What's the matter? Don't we have razor blades like the Arabs?&quot;<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
<p>Because of poor access to information, and because circumcisers downplay the causal connection, women may not associate the health consequences with the procedure. Lala Bald&lt;U+00E9&gt;, president of a women's association in Medina Cherif, a village in Senegal, told Mackie in 1998 that when girls fell ill or died, it was attributed to evil spirits. When informed of the causal relationship, Mackie writes, the women broke down and wept. He argues that surveys taken before and after this sharing of information would show very different levels of support for FGM.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>Mackie has worked with UNICEF to develop programmes in which whole villages pledge to leave their daughters uncut and allow their sons to marry uncut girls.<ref><a href="https://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2013/UNICEF-UNFPA%20Joint%20Programme%20AR_final_v14.pdf">UNFPA&lt;U+2013&gt;UNICEF 2012</a>, p. 18.</p>

It is praised in several <em><a href="hadith" class="uri" title="wikilink">hadith</a></em> (sayings attributed to Muhammad) as noble but not required, along with advice that the milder forms are kinder to women.

<p>The examination of <a href="Mummy" title="wikilink">mummies</a> has shown no evidence of FGM. Citing the Australian pathologist <a href="Grafton_Elliot_Smith" title="wikilink">Grafton Elliot Smith</a>, who examined hundreds of mummies in the early 20th century, Knight writes that the genital area may resemble Type III, because during mummification the skin of the outer labia was pulled toward the anus to cover the <a href="pudendal_cleft" title="wikilink">pudendal cleft</a>, possibly to prevent sexual violation. It was similarly not possible to determine whether Types I or II had been performed, because soft tissues had been removed by the embalmers or had deteriorated.<ref><a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3080631">Knight 2001</a>, p. 331, citing G. Elliot Smith, <em>A Contribution to the Study of Mummification in Egypt</em>, 1906, p. 30.</p>
<p>Knight quotes <a href="Marc_Armand_Ruffer" title="wikilink">Marc Armand Ruffer</a>, <em>Studies in the Paleopathology of Egypt</em>, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1921, p. 171: &quot;[T]he bodies are in such a state that it would often be difficult to state with certainty whether such an operation had been done.&quot; Knight adds: &quot;In light of the fact that only rarely have scientific researchers autopsying mummies specifically looked for the presence or absence of FGM, conclusive remarks about the prevalence of the practice must await a detailed study of a large cohort of female mummies.&quot;</ref></p>

<p>The Greek geographer <a href="Strabo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Strabo</a> (c. 64 BCE &lt;U+2013&gt; c. 23 CE) wrote about FGM after visiting Egypt around 25 BCE <em>(right)</em>.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> The philosopher <a href="Philo" title="wikilink">Philo of Alexandria</a> (c. 20 BCE &lt;U+2013&gt; 50 CE) also made reference to it: &quot;the Egyptians by the custom of their country circumcise the marriageable youth and maid in the fourteenth (year) of their age, when the male begins to get seed, and the female to have a menstrual flow.&quot;<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> It is mentioned briefly in a work attributed to the Greek physician <a href="Galen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galen</a> (129 &lt;U+2013&gt; c. 200 CE): &quot;When [the clitoris] sticks out to a great extent in their young women, Egyptians consider it appropriate to cut it out.&quot;<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<p>Another Greek physician, <a href="A&lt;U+00EB&gt;tius_of_Amida" title="wikilink">A&lt;U+00EB&gt;tius of Amida</a> (mid-5th to mid-6th century CE), offered more detail in book 16 of his <em>Sixteen Books on Medicine</em>, citing the physician Philomenes. The procedure was performed in case the clitoris, or <em>nymph&lt;U+00EA&gt;</em>, grew too large or triggered sexual desire when rubbing against clothing. &quot;On this account, it seemed proper to the Egyptians to remove it before it became greatly enlarged,&quot; A&lt;U+00EB&gt;tius wrote, &quot;especially at that time when the girls were about to be married&quot;:</p>
<div style="background-color:none;margin-right:8em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 10px #ccc;padding:1.5em;text-align:justify">
<p>The surgery is performed in this way: Have the girl sit on a chair while a muscled young man standing behind her places his arms below the girl's thighs. Have him separate and steady her legs and whole body. Standing in front and taking hold of the clitoris with a broad-mouthed forceps in his left hand, the surgeon stretches it outward, while with the right hand, he cuts it off at the point next to the pincers of the forceps.</p>
<p>It is proper to let a length remain from that cut off, about the size of the membrane that's between the nostrils, so as to take away the excess material only; as I have said, the part to be removed is at that point just above the pincers of the forceps. Because the clitoris is a skinlike structure and stretches out excessively, do not cut off too much, as a urinary fistula may result from cutting such large growths too deeply.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>

<p>The genital area was then cleaned with a sponge, <a href="frankincense" class="uri" title="wikilink">frankincense</a> powder and wine or cold water, and wrapped in linen bandages dipped in vinegar, until the seventh day when <a href="calamine" class="uri" title="wikilink">calamine</a>, rose petals, date pits or a &quot;genital powder made from baked clay&quot; might be applied.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<p>Whatever the practice's origins, infibulation became linked to slavery. Mackie cites the Portuguese missionary <a href="Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_dos_Santos" title="wikilink">Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o dos Santos</a>, who in 1609 wrote of a group inland from Mogadishu who had a &quot;custome to sew up their Females, especially their slaves being young to make them unable for conception, which makes these slaves sell dearer, both for their chastitie, and for better confidence which their Masters put in them.&quot; The English explorer <a href="William_George_Browne" title="wikilink">William Browne</a> wrote in 1799 that the Egyptians practised excision, and that slaves in that country were infibulated to prevent pregnancy.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> Thus, Mackie argues, a &quot;practice associated with shameful female slavery came to stand for honor.&quot;<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>

<p>Protestant missionaries in <a href="East_Africa_Protectorate" title="wikilink">British East Africa</a> (present-day Kenya), began campaigning against FGM in the early 20th century when Dr. <a href="John_Arthur" title="wikilink">John Arthur</a> joined the Church of Scotland Mission (CSM) in Kikuyu. The practice was known by the <a href="Kikuyu_people" title="wikilink">Kikuyu</a>, the country's main ethnic group, as <em>irua</em> for both girls and boys, and involved excision (Type II) for girls and removal of the foreskin for boys.

<p><a href="Jomo_Kenyatta" title="wikilink">Jomo Kenyatta</a>, general secretary of the Kikuyu Central Association and Kenya's first prime minister from 1963, wrote in 1938 that, for the Kikuyu, the institution of FGM was the &quot;<em>conditio sine qua non</em> of the whole teaching of tribal law, religion and morality.&quot; No proper Kikuyu man or woman would marry or have sexual relations with someone who was not circumcised. A woman's responsibilities toward the tribe began with her initiation; her age and place within tribal history was traced to that day, and the group of girls with whom she was cut was named according to current events, an <a href="oral_tradition" title="wikilink">oral tradition</a> that allowed the Kikuyu to track people and events going back hundreds of years.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1975 the American social scientist Rose Oldfield Hayes became the first female academic to publish a detailed account of FGM, aided by her ability to discuss the issues directly with women in Sudan. Her article in <em>American Ethnologist</em> called it &quot;female genital mutilation,&quot; and brought it to wider academic attention.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> Four years later Austrian-American feminist <a href="Fran_Hosken" title="wikilink">Fran Hosken</a> published <em>The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females</em> (1979), the first to estimate the global number of women cut. She wrote that 110,529,000 women in 20 African countries had experienced FGM.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> The figures were speculative, but in several instances consistent with later surveys; Mackie writes that her work was &quot;more informative than the silence that preceded her efforts.&quot;<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Describing FGM as a &quot;training ground for male violence,&quot; Hosken accused female practitioners of &quot;participating in the destruction of their own kind.&quot;<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> The language caused a rift between Western and African feminists; African women boycotted a session featuring Hosken during the UN's Mid-Decade Conference on Women in Copenhagen in July 1980.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
<p>The Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children, founded after a seminar in Dakar, Senegal, in 1984, called for an end to the practice, as did the UN's <a href="World_Conference_on_Human_Rights" title="wikilink">World Conference on Human Rights</a> in Vienna in June 1993. The conference listed FGM as a form of violence against women, marking it as a human-rights violation, rather than a medical issue.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> Throughout the 1990s and 2000s African governments banned or restricted it.

<p>Egypt finally outlawed FGM in 2008 after at least two partial bans. Two incidents had attracted international attention. In 1994 CNN broadcast images of a child undergoing FGM in a barber's shop in Cairo, and in 2007 a child died during an FGM procedure. The death prompted the Al-Azhar Supreme Council of Islamic Research, the country's highest religious authority, to rule that FGM had no basis in Islamic law, and the government banned it in July 2007 by ministerial decree. Conducting FGM was added as a criminal offence to the country's penal code in June 2008.<ref>For CNN, Salam 1999, p. 322.</p>

The programme helped to create alternative rites of passage in Uganda and Kenya, and in Sudan supported the (pre-existing) <em>Saleema</em> initiative. <em>Saleema</em> means &quot;whole&quot; in Arabic; the initiative promotes the term as a desirable description of an uncut woman.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> The programme noted that anti-FGM law enforcement is weak, and that, even where arrests are made, prosecution may fail because of inadequate collection of evidence.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> It therefore supported the training of 3,011 personnel in eight countries (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Senegal and Uganda) in how to enforce the laws, and sponsored campaigns to raise awareness of them.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>

<p>As a result of immigration FGM spread to Australia, Europe, North America and Scandinavia.<ref><a href="http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/fgm_eng.pdf">UNICEF 2005</a>, p. 4: &quot;Beyond economic factors, migratory patterns have frequently reflected links established in the colonial past. For instance, citizens from Benin, Chad, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Senegal have often chosen France as their destination, while many Kenyan, Nigerian and Ugandan citizens have migrated to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>&quot;In the 1970s, war, civil unrest and drought in a number of African states, including Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia, resulted in an influx of refugees to Western Europe, where some countries, such as Norway and Sweden, had been relatively unaffected by migration up to that point.

<p>Anthropologist <a href="Eric_Silverman" title="wikilink">Eric Silverman</a> wrote in 2004 that FGM had &quot;emerged as one of the central moral topics of contemporary anthropology.&quot; Anthropologists have accused FGM eradicationists of cultural colonialism; in turn, the former have been criticized for their moral relativism and failure to defend the idea of universal human rights.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> According to the opposition's critics, the biological reductionism of the opposition, and the failure to appreciate the practice's cultural context, undermines the practitioners' agency and serves to &quot;other&quot; them &lt;U+2013&gt; in particular by calling African parents mutilators.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> Yet Africans who object to the opposition risk appearing to defend FGM.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> Feminist theorist Obioma Nnaemeka &lt;U+2013&gt; herself strongly opposed to FGM (&quot;If one is circumcised, it is one too many&quot;) &lt;U+2013&gt; argues that the impact of renaming it <em>female genital mutilation</em> cannot be underestimated:</p>

<p>In this name game, although the discussion is about African women, a subtext of barbaric African and Muslim cultures and the West's relevance (even indispensability) in purging the barbarism marks another era where colonialism and missionary zeal determined what &quot;civilization&quot; was, and figured out how and when to force it on people who did not ask for it.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>Ugandan law professor <a href="Sylvia_Tamale" title="wikilink">Sylvia Tamale</a> argues that early Western opposition to FGM stemmed from a Judeo-Christian judgment that African sexual and family practices &lt;U+2013&gt; including <a href="dry_sex" title="wikilink">dry sex</a>, <a href="polygyny" class="uri" title="wikilink">polygyny</a>, <a href="bride_price" title="wikilink">bride price</a> and <a href="levirate_marriage" title="wikilink">levirate marriage</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; were primitive and required correction.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> African feminists &quot;do not condone the negative aspects of the practice,&quot; writes Tamale, but &quot;take strong exception to the imperialist, racist and dehumanising infantilization of African women.&quot;<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a></p>
<p>The debate has highlighted a tension between anthropology and feminism, with the former's focus on tolerance and the latter's on equal rights for all women. Anthropologist Christine Walley writes that a common trope within the anti-FGM literature has been to present African women as victims of <a href="false_consciousness" title="wikilink">false consciousness</a> participating in their own oppression, a position promoted by several feminists in the 1970s and 1980s, including Fran Hosken, <a href="Mary_Daly" title="wikilink">Mary Daly</a> and Hanny Lightfoot-Klein. It prompted the French Association of Anthropologists to issue a statement in 1981, at the height of the early debates, that &quot;a certain feminism resuscitates (today) the moralistic arrogance of yesterday's colonialism.&quot;<ref>Christine J. Walley, &quot;Searching for 'Voices': Feminism, Anthropology, and the Global Over Female Genital Operations&quot; in James and Robertson 2002, pp. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=t_5a39rTNB8C&amp;pg=PA18">18</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=t_5a39rTNB8C&amp;pg=PA34">34</a> (for false consciousness), 43.</p>

<p>As an example of the disrespect arguably shown toward women who have undergone FGM, commentators highlight the appropriation of the women's bodies as exhibits. Historian Chima Korieh cites the publication in 1996 of the <a href="Pulitzer_Prize_for_Feature_Photography" title="wikilink">Pulitzer-prize-winning</a> photographs <em>(<a href="#Pulitzer" title="wikilink">above</a>)</em> of a 16-year-old Kenyan girl undergoing FGM. The photographs were published by 12 American newspapers, but according to Korieh the girl had not given permission for the images to be taken, much less published.<ref>Chima Korieh, {{&quot; '}}Other' Bodies: Western Feminism, Race and Representation in Female Circumcision Discourse,&quot; in Nnaemeka 2005, pp. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&amp;pg=PA121">121&lt;U+2013&gt;122</a>.</p>

<p>Whether FGM is invariably harmful is also disputed.

<p>Carla Obermeyer maintains that FGM may be conducive to women's well-being within their communities in the same way that <a href="rhinoplasty" class="uri" title="wikilink">rhinoplasty</a> and male circumcision may help people elsewhere.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> In Egypt, despite the 2008 ban, women wanting FGM for their daughters discuss the need for <em>amalyet tajmeel</em> (cosmetic surgery) to remove what is viewed as excess genital tissue for a more acceptable appearance.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a></p>
<p>The WHO does not cite procedures such as <a href="labiaplasty" class="uri" title="wikilink">labiaplasty</a> and <a href="clitoral_hood_reduction" title="wikilink">clitoral hood reduction</a> as examples of FGM, but its definition aims to avoid loopholes, so several elective practices do fall within its categories.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> Some of the laws banning FGM would seem to cover cosmetic procedures. Sweden, for example, has banned operations &quot;on the external female genital organs which are designed to mutilate them or produce other permanent changes in them&quot; regardless of consent.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> Gynaecologist Birgitta Ess&lt;U+00E9&gt;n and anthropologist Sara Johnsdotter note that it seems the law distinguishes between Western and African genitals, and deems only African women (such as those seeking reinfibulation after childbirth) unfit to make their own decisions.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a></p>
<p>Arguing against suggested similarities between FGM and dieting or body shaping, philosopher <a href="Martha_Nussbaum" title="wikilink">Martha Nussbaum</a> writes that a key difference is that FGM is mostly conducted on children using physical force. She argues that the distinction between social pressure and physical force is morally and legally salient, comparable to the distinction between seduction and rape. She argues further that the literacy of women in practising countries is generally poorer than in the Western world, and that this reduces their ability to make informed choices.<ref>Nussbaum 1999, pp. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=7zoaKIolT9oC&amp;pg=PA123">123&lt;U+2013&gt;124</a>.</p>

<p>Several commentators maintain that children's rights are violated with the genital alteration of <a href="intersex" class="uri" title="wikilink">intersex</a> children, who are born with anomalies that physicians choose to correct. Legal scholars Nancy Ehrenreich and Mark Barr write that thousands of these procedures take place every year in the United States, and say that they are medically unnecessary, more extensive than FGM, and have more serious physical and mental consequences. They attribute the silence of anti-FGM campaigners about intersex procedures to white privilege and a refusal to acknowledge that &quot;similar unnecessary and harmful genital cutting occurs in their own backyards.&quot;<ref>Nancy Ehrenreich, Mark Barr, <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/crcl/vol40_1/ehrenreich.pdf">&quot;Intersex Surgery, Female Genital Cutting, and the Selective Condemnation of 'Cultural Practices{{' &quot;}}</a>, <em>Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review</em>, 40(1), 2005 (pp. 71&lt;U+2013&gt;140), pp. 74&lt;U+2013&gt;75.</p>

Both customs are nearly universal where practiced; they are persistent and are practiced even by those who oppose them. Both control sexual access to females and ensure female chastity and fidelity. Both are necessary for proper marriage and family honor. Both are believed to be sanctioned by tradition. Both are said to be ethnic markers, and distinct ethnic minorities may lack the practices. Both seem to have a past of contagious diffusion. Both are exaggerated over time and both increase with status. Both are supported and transmitted by women, are performed on girls about six to eight years old, and are generally not initiation rites. Both are believed to promote health and fertility. Both are defined as aesthetically pleasing compared with the natural alternative. Both are said to properly exaggerate the complementarity of the sexes, and both are claimed to make intercourse more pleasurable for the male.&quot;<a href="#fnref94" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
