Knowledge of many non-literate cultures is drawn largely from these sources.</p>
<p>Funerary art can serve many cultural functions. It can play a role in burial rites, serve as an article for use by the dead in the afterlife, and celebrate the life and accomplishments of the dead, whether as part of kinship-centered practices of <a href="ancestor_veneration" title="wikilink">ancestor veneration</a> or as a publicly directed <a href="Dynasty" title="wikilink">dynastic</a> display. It can also function as a reminder of the mortality of humankind, as an expression of cultural values and roles, and help to propitiate the spirits of the dead, maintaining their benevolence and preventing their unwelcome intrusion into the affairs of the living.</p>
<p>The deposit of objects with an apparent aesthetic intention may go back to the <a href="Neanderthal" title="wikilink">Neanderthals</a> over 50,000 years ago,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and is found in almost all subsequent cultures&lt;U+2014&gt;the <a href="Hinduism" title="wikilink">Hindu</a> culture, which has little, is a notable exception.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Many of the best-known artistic creations of past cultures&lt;U+2014&gt;from the <a href="Egyptian_pyramids" title="wikilink">Egyptian pyramids</a> and the <a href="KV62" title="wikilink">Tutankhamun treasure</a> to the <a href="Terracotta_Army" title="wikilink">Terracotta Army</a> surrounding the tomb of the <a href="Qin_Shi_Huang" title="wikilink">Qin Emperor</a>, the <a href="Mausoleum_of_Halicarnassus" title="wikilink">Mausoleum of Halicarnassus</a>, the <a href="Sutton_Hoo" title="wikilink">Sutton Hoo</a> ship burial and the <a href="Taj_Mahal" title="wikilink">Taj Mahal</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;are tombs or objects found in and around them. In most instances, specialized funeral art was produced for the powerful and wealthy, although the burials of ordinary people might include simple monuments and grave goods, usually from their possessions.</p>
<p>An important factor in the development of traditions of funerary art is the division between what was intended to be visible to visitors or the public after completion of the <a href="funeral" class="uri" title="wikilink">funeral</a> ceremonies.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The <a href="Tutankhamun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tutankhamun</a> treasure, for example, though exceptionally lavish, was never intended to be seen again by humans after it was deposited, while the exterior of the Pyramids were a permanent and highly effective demonstration of the power of their creators. A similar division can be seen in grand East Asian tombs. In other cultures nearly all the art connected with the burial, except for limited grave goods, was intended to remain visible to the public, or at least those admitted by the custodians. In these cultures traditions such as the sculpted <a href="sarcophagus" class="uri" title="wikilink">sarcophagus</a> and <a href="tomb_monument" title="wikilink">tomb monuments</a> of the Greek and Roman empires, and later the Christian world, have flourished. The <a href="mausoleum" class="uri" title="wikilink">mausoleum</a> intended for visiting was the grandest type of tomb in the classical world, and later common in <a href="Islam" title="wikilink">Islamic</a> culture.</p>

This effect was often achieved by encapsulating a single corpse in a basic pit, surrounded by an elaborate ditch and drain. Over-ground commemoration is thought to be tied to the concept of collective memory, and these early tombs were likely intended as a form of <a href="ancestor-worship" class="uri" title="wikilink">ancestor-worship</a>, a development available only to communities that had advanced to the stage of settled livestock and formed social roles and relationships and specialized sectors of activity.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="Neolithic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neolithic</a> and <a href="Bronze_Age" title="wikilink">Bronze Age</a> societies, a great variety of tombs are found, with tumulus mounds, megaliths and pottery as recurrent elements.

<p>Egyptian funerary art was inseparably connected to the <a href="Ancient_Egyptian_religion" title="wikilink">religious belief</a> that life continued after death &lt;U+2013&gt; even more, it expressed a belief that &quot;death is a mere phase of life&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Aesthetic objects and images connected with this belief were partially intended to preserve material goods, wealth and status for the journey between this life and the next,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and to &quot;commemorate the life of the tomb owner ... depict performance of the burial rites, and in general present an environment that would be conducive to the tomb owner's rebirth.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In this context, Egyptian <a href="mummy" title="wikilink">mummies</a> encased in one or more layers of decorated coffin, are famous; <a href="canopic_jar" title="wikilink">canopic jars</a> preserved the internal organs. A special category of <a href="Ancient_Egyptian_funerary_texts" title="wikilink">Ancient Egyptian funerary texts</a> clarify the purposes of the burial customs. The early <a href="mastaba" class="uri" title="wikilink">mastaba</a> type of tomb had a sealed underground burial chamber but an offering-chamber on the ground level for visits by the living, a pattern repeated in later types of tomb. An effigy of the deceased might be walled up in a <em><a href="serdab" class="uri" title="wikilink">serdab</a></em> connected to the offering chamber by vents that allowed the smell of <a href="incense" class="uri" title="wikilink">incense</a> to reach the effigy.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The walls of important tomb-chambers and offering chambers were heavily decorated with <a href="relief" title="wikilink">reliefs</a> in stone or sometimes wood, or paintings, depicting religious scenes, portraits of the deceased, and at some periods vivid images of everyday life, depicting the afterlife.

<p><a href="Representation_(arts)" title="wikilink">Representational art</a>, such as individual portraiture of the deceased, is found extremely early on and continues into the Roman period in the <a href="Encaustic_painting" title="wikilink">encaustic</a> <a href="Faiyum_mummy_portraits" title="wikilink">Faiyum funerary portraits</a> applied to coffins.

<p>Objects connected with death, in particular <a href="sarcophagus" title="wikilink">sarcophagi</a> and <a href="cinerary_urn" title="wikilink">cinerary urns</a>, form the basis of much of current knowledge of the ancient <a href="Etruscan_civilization" title="wikilink">Etruscan civilization</a> and <a href="Etruscan_art" title="wikilink">its art</a>, which once competed with the <a href="culture_of_ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">culture of ancient Rome</a>, but was eventually absorbed into it.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The sarcophagi and the lids of the urns often incorporate a reclining image of the deceased.

<p>The motif of the funerary art of the 7th and 6th centuries BCE was typically a feasting scene, sometimes with dancers and musicians, or athletic competitions. Household bowls, cups, and pitchers are sometimes found in the graves, along with food such as eggs, pomegranates, honey, grapes and olives for use in the afterlife.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> From the 5th century, the mood changed to more somber and gruesome scenes of parting, where the deceased are shown leaving their loved ones,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> often surrounded by underworld demons, and psychopomps, such as <a href="Charun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Charun</a> or the winged female <a href="Vanth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vanth</a>.

<p>The burial customs of the <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">ancient Romans</a> were influenced by both of the first significant cultures whose territories they conquered as their state expanded, namely the Greeks of <a href="Magna_Graecia" title="wikilink">Magna Graecia</a> and the Etruscans.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The original Roman custom was <a href="cremation" class="uri" title="wikilink">cremation</a>, after which the burnt remains were kept in a pot, ash-chest or urn, often in a <em><a href="columbarium" class="uri" title="wikilink">columbarium</a></em>; pre-Roman burials around Rome often used hut-urns&lt;U+2014&gt;little pottery houses.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> From about the second century CE, <a href="inhumation" class="uri" title="wikilink">inhumation</a> (burial of unburnt remains) in sarcophagi, often elaborately carved, became more fashionable for those who could afford it.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Greek-style medallion portrait sculptures on a <em>stela</em>, or small mausoleum for the rich, housing either an urn or sarcophagus, were often placed in a location such as a roadside, where it would be very visible to the living and perpetuate the memory of the dead. Often a couple are shown, signifying a longing for reunion in the afterlife rather than a double burial.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>In later periods, life-size sculptures of the deceased reclining as though at a meal or social gathering are found, a common Etruscan style. Family tombs for the grandest late Roman families, like the <a href="Tomb_of_the_Scipios" title="wikilink">Tomb of the Scipios</a>, were large mausoleums with facilities for visits by the living, including kitchens and bedrooms. The <a href="Castel_Sant&#39;Angelo" title="wikilink">Castel Sant'Angelo</a>, built for <a href="Hadrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hadrian</a>, was later converted into a fortress. Compared to the Etruscans, though, there was less emphasis on provision of a lifestyle for the deceased, although paintings of useful objects or pleasant activities, like hunting, are seen.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Ancestor portraits, usually in the form of wax masks, were kept in the home, apparently often in little cupboards,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> although grand patrician families kept theirs on display in the <em><a href="Domus" title="wikilink">atrium</a></em>. They were worn in the funeral processions of members of the family by persons wearing appropriate costume for the figure represented, as described by <a href="Pliny_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Pliny the Elder</a> and <a href="Polybius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Polybius</a>. Pliny also describes the custom of having a bust-portrait of an ancestor painted on a round bronze shield (<em><a href="clipeus" class="uri" title="wikilink">clipeus</a></em>), and having it hung in a temple or other public place. No examples of either type have survived.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>By the late <a href="Roman_Republic" title="wikilink">Republic</a> there was considerable competition among wealthy Romans for the best locations for tombs, which lined all the approach roads to the city up to the walls, and a variety of exotic and unusual designs sought to catch the attention of the passer-by and so perpetuate the memory of the deceased and increase the prestige of their family. Examples include the <a href="Tomb_of_Eurysaces_the_Baker" title="wikilink">Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker</a>, a <a href="freedman" class="uri" title="wikilink">freedman</a>, the <a href="Pyramid_of_Cestius" title="wikilink">Pyramid of Cestius</a>, and the Mausoleum of <a href="Caecilia_Metella_(daughter_of_Metellus_Creticus)" title="wikilink">Caecilia Metella</a>, all built within a few decades of the start of the <a href="Common_Era" title="wikilink">Common Era</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>In Italy, sarcophagi were mostly intended to be set against the wall of the tomb, and only decorated on three sides, in contrast to the free-standing styles of Greece and the Eastern Empire. The relief scenes of Hellenistic art became even more densely crowded in later Roman sarcophagi, as for example in the 2nd century <a href="Portonaccio_sarcophagus" title="wikilink">Portonaccio sarcophagus</a>, and various styles and forms emerged, such as the columnar type with an &quot;architectural background of columns and niches for its figures&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> A well-known Early Christian example is the <a href="Sarcophagus_of_Junius_Bassus" title="wikilink">Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus</a>, used for an important new convert who died in 359. Many sarcophagi from leading centres were exported around the Empire.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The Romans had already developed the expression of religious and philosophical ideas in narrative scenes from <a href="Greek_mythology" title="wikilink">Greek mythology</a>, treated <a href="allegorically" class="uri" title="wikilink">allegorically</a>;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> they later transferred this habit to Christian ideas, using Biblical scenes.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, Washington." alt="&quot;Military Guardian&quot;, Chinese funerary statue. Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, Washington." /> Funerary art varied greatly across Chinese history. Tombs of early rulers rival the ancient Egyptians for complexity and value of grave goods, and have been similarly pillaged over the centuries by <a href="tomb_robber" title="wikilink">tomb robbers</a>. For a long time, literary references to <a href="jade_burial_suit" title="wikilink">jade burial suits</a> were regarded by scholars as fanciful myths, but a number of examples were excavated in the 20th century, and it is now believed that they were relatively common among early rulers. Knowledge of pre-dynastic Chinese culture has been expanded by spectacular discoveries at <a href="Sanxingdui" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sanxingdui</a> and other sites. Very large tumuli could be erected, and later, mausoleums. Several special large shapes of <a href="Shang_dynasty" title="wikilink">Shang dynasty</a> bronze ritual vessels may have been made for burial only; the <a href="Tomb_of_Fu_Hao" title="wikilink">Tomb of Fu Hao</a> (c BCE 1200) is one of the few undisturbed royal tombs of the period to have been excavated&lt;U+2014&gt;most funerary art has appeared on the art market without archaeological context.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>The discovery in 1974 of the <a href="Terracotta_army" title="wikilink">Terracotta army</a> located the tomb of the <a href="First_Qin_Emperor" title="wikilink">First Qin Emperor</a> (died 210 BCE), but the main tumulus, of which literary descriptions survive, has not been excavated. Remains surviving above ground from several imperial tombs of the <a href="Han_dynasty" title="wikilink">Han dynasty</a> show traditions maintained until the end of imperial rule. The tomb itself is an &quot;underground palace&quot; beneath a sealed tumulus surrounded by a wall, with several buildings set at some distance away down avenues for the observation of rites of veneration, and the accomodation of both permanent staff and those visiting to perform rites, as well as gateways, towers and other buildings. This complex is approached by a &quot;spirit road&quot;, sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals, and <a href="Bixi_(tortoise)" title="wikilink"><em>bixi</em></a> or stelae mounted on tortoises. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of &quot;lions&quot; and &quot;<a href="chimera" title="wikilink">chimeras</a>&quot;; in later periods they are much more varied.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> A looted tomb with fine paintings is the <a href="Empress_Dowager_Wenming_tomb" title="wikilink">Empress Dowager Wenming tomb</a> of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th century <a href="Tang_dynasty" title="wikilink">Tang dynasty</a> <a href="Qianling_Mausoleum" title="wikilink">Qianling Mausoleum</a> group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The <a href="complex_of_Goguryeo_Tombs" title="wikilink">complex of Goguryeo Tombs</a>, from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern <a href="Korea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Korea</a>, are especially rich in paintings. Only one of the <a href="Imperial_Tombs_of_the_Ming_and_Qing_Dynasties" title="wikilink">Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties</a> has been excavated, in 1956, with such <a href="Ming_Dynasty_Tombs" title="wikilink">disastrous results</a> for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that the current policy is to leave them undisturbed.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Lei_Cheng_Uk_Han_Tomb_Museum" title="wikilink">Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum</a> in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd century Wu Family tombs of <a href="Jiaxiang_County" title="wikilink">Jiaxiang County</a>, <a href="Shandong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shandong</a> are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones. The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescos of the period. A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> After the introduction of Buddhism, carved &quot;funerary couches&quot; featured similar scenes, now mostly religious.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> During the Han Dynasty, <a href="Science_and_technology_of_the_Han_Dynasty#Ceramic_model_buildings" title="wikilink">miniature ceramic models</a> of buildings were often made to accompany the deceased in the graves; to them is owed much of what is known of ancient Chinese architecture.

<p>Buddhist tombs themselves are typically simple and modest, although they may be set within temples, sometimes large complexes, built for the purpose in the then-prevailing style. According to tradition, the remains of the <a href="Buddha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buddha</a>'s body after <a href="cremation" class="uri" title="wikilink">cremation</a> were entirely divided up into relics (<em><a href="cetiya" class="uri" title="wikilink">cetiya</a></em>), which played an important part in early Buddhism. The <em><a href="stupa" class="uri" title="wikilink">stupa</a></em> developed as a monument enclosing deposits of relics of the Buddha from plain hemispherical mounds in the 3rd century BCE to elaborate structures such as those at <a href="Sanchi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sanchi</a> in India and <a href="Borobudur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Borobudur</a> in <a href="Java" class="uri" title="wikilink">Java</a>.

Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a <a href="crypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">crypt</a> or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the <a href="shrine" title="wikilink">shrines</a> of saints, which became the destinations of <a href="pilgrimage" title="wikilink">pilgrimages</a>.

Elsewhere, death masks were used in similar fashion. <a href="Hatchment" title="wikilink">Hatchments</a> were a special lozenge-shaped painted <a href="coat_of_arms" title="wikilink">coat of arms</a> which was displayed on the house of the deceased for a mourning period, before usually being moved to hang in the church. Like <a href="mourning" title="wikilink">mourning clothes</a>, these fall outside a strict definition of art.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p>For some time after the <a href="Protestant_Reformation" title="wikilink">Protestant Reformation</a>, <a href="English_church_monuments" title="wikilink">English church monuments</a> formed the majority of large-scale artworks added to Protestant churches, especially in sculpture. The English upper classes ceased to commission altarpieces and other religious art for churches, but their tomb monuments continued to grow in size to fill the empty wall spaces; similar trends were seen in <a href="Lutheran" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lutheran</a> countries, but <a href="Calvinism" title="wikilink">Calvinists</a> tended to be more disapproving of figure sculpture.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> Many portraits were painted after death, and sometimes dead family members were included along with the living; a variety of indications might be used to suggest the distinction.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<p>The large <a href="Baroque" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baroque</a> tomb monument continued likely to include a portrait of the deceased, and was more likely to include personified figures of Death, Time, Virtues or other figures than angels. The late medieval <a href="transi" class="uri" title="wikilink">transi</a> tomb vocabulary of images of bodily decay, such as skulls and skeletons, was sometimes re-introduced, but in a less confrontational manner.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> <a href="Neo-Classicism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neo-Classicism</a>, led by <a href="Antonio_Canova" title="wikilink">Antonio Canova</a>, revived the classical <em>stela</em>, either with a portrait or a personification; in this style there was little or no difference between the demands of Catholic and Protestant patrons.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>

<p>By the 19th century, many <a href="Old_World" title="wikilink">Old World</a> churchyards and church walls had completely run out of room for new monuments, and cemeteries on the outskirts of cities, towns or villages became the usual place for burials.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> The rich developed the classical styles of the ancient world for small family tombs, while the rest continued to use gravestones or what were now usually false sarcophagi, placed over a buried coffin. The cemeteries of the large Italian cities are generally accepted to have outdone those of other nations in terms of extravagant statuary, especially the <a href="Monumental_Cemetery_of_Staglieno" title="wikilink">Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno</a> in <a href="Genoa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Genoa</a>, the <a href="Cimitero_Monumentale_di_Milano" title="wikilink">Cimitero Monumentale di Milano</a> and the <a href="Certosa_di_Bologna" title="wikilink">Certosa di Bologna</a>.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> In Italy at least, funerary sculpture remained of equal status to other types during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and was made by the leading artists, often receiving reviews in the press, and being exhibited, perhaps in <a href="maquette" class="uri" title="wikilink">maquette</a> form.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Monuments kept up with contemporary stylistic developments during the 19th century, embracing <a href="Symbolism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Symbolism</a> enthusiatically, but then gradually became detached from the <a href="avant-garde" class="uri" title="wikilink">avant-garde</a> after <a href="Art_Nouveau" title="wikilink">Art Nouveau</a> and a few <a href="Art_Deco" title="wikilink">Art Deco</a> examples.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> Where burials in church crypts or floors took place, memorial <a href="stained_glass" title="wikilink">stained glass</a> windows, mostly on normal religious subjects but with a commemorative panel, are often found. <a href="War_memorial" title="wikilink">War memorials</a>, other than on the site of a battle, were relatively unusual until the 19th century, but became increasingly common during it, and after <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> were erected even in villages of the main combatant nations.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="islam">Islam</h3>
<p>Islamic funerary art is dominated by <a href="architecture" class="uri" title="wikilink">architecture</a>. Grave goods are discouraged to the point that their absence is frequently one recognition criterion of Muslim burials.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> Royalty and important religious figures were typically buried in plain stone sarcophagi, perhaps with a religious inscription. However, funerary architecture often offered a means of &quot;moving beyond the strictures of formal Muslim burial rites&quot; and expressing social dimensions such as status, piety, love for the deceased, and Muslim identity.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> A number of distinct architectural traditions arose for expressing these social elements. The Islamic tradition was slow in starting; the <em><a href="hadith" class="uri" title="wikilink">hadith</a></em> &quot;condemn the building of tombs, and <a href="Muhammed" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muhammed</a> himself set the example of requesting burial in an unmarked grave in one of the chambers of his house&quot; in <a href="Medina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Medina</a>,<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> though by at least the 12th century, buildings of the vast <a href="Al-Masjid_al-Nabawi" title="wikilink">Al-Masjid al-Nabawi</a> complex already marked the site. The earliest identified Muslim monumental tomb, in <a href="Samarra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samarra</a> in Iraq, only dates from 862, and was commissioned by the Byzantine princess whose son was buried there.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> At some point, the tradition incorporated the idea of a garden setting, perhaps following the Islamic concept of <a href="Paradise" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paradise</a>, an association certainly made when the tradition was mature, although the difficulty of reconstructing gardens from archaeology makes the early stages of this process hard to trace. At any rate, gardens surrounding tombs became established in Islamic tradition in many parts of the world, and existing pleasure gardens were sometimes appropriated for this purpose. Versions of the formal Persian <em><a href="charbagh" class="uri" title="wikilink">charbagh</a></em> design were widely used in India, Persia and elsewhere.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>

<p>Another influence may have been the octagonal <a href="Dome_of_the_Rock" title="wikilink">Dome of the Rock</a> in <a href="Jerusalem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jerusalem</a>, not a mausoleum itself, but &quot;the earliest Islamic model for centrally-planned commemorative buildings&quot;, adapting the Byzantine form of the martyrium in a building standing alone, though on a stone platform rather than in a garden.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> In the <a href="Persianate_society" title="wikilink">Persian sphere</a>, a tradition of relatively small mausoleums evolved, often in the shape of short hexagonal or octagonal <a href="dome" title="wikilink">domed</a> towers, usually containing a single chamber, like the <a href="Malek_Tomb" title="wikilink">Malek Tomb</a>. These single-chambered tombs developed into larger buildings in the <a href="Timurid_dynasty" title="wikilink">Timurid</a> and <a href="Mughal_Empire" title="wikilink">Mughal</a> Empires,<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> like the <a href="Gur-e_Amir" title="wikilink">Gur-e Amir</a> tomb of <a href="Timur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Timur</a> at <a href="Samarkand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samarkand</a> and the famous Mughal tombs of India, which culminated in the <a href="Taj_Mahal" title="wikilink">Taj Mahal</a>. The Mughal tombs are mostly set in a large walled <em>charbagh</em> (<em>chahar-bagh</em>) or <a href="Mughal_gardens" title="wikilink">Mughal gardens</a>, often with <a href="Pavilion_(structure)" title="wikilink">pavilions</a> at the corners<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> and a gatehouse. The Taj Mahal is atypically placed at the end of the garden, backing onto the river <a href="Yamuna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yamuna</a>; a central placing is usual.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> They may have <a href="minaret" title="wikilink">minarets</a>, although they do not normally function as <a href="mosque" title="wikilink">mosques</a>. The <a href="Tomb_of_Jahangir" title="wikilink">Tomb of Jahangir</a> lacks any dome,<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> while the <a href="Tomb_of_Akbar_the_Great" title="wikilink">Tomb of Akbar the Great</a> has only small decorative ones. Other Islamic Indian rulers built similar tombs, of which the <a href="Gol_Gumbaz" title="wikilink">Gol Gumbaz</a> is perhaps the most remarkable.</p>
<p>In all this tradition, the contemporary architectural style for mosques was adapted for a building with a smaller main room, and usually no courtyard. Decoration was often tilework, and could include <em><a href="pietre_dure" title="wikilink">parchin kari</a></em> inlays in semi-precious stone, painting, and decorative carving. The sarcophagus might be in a small inner chamber, dimly visible through a grille of metal or stone, or might stand in the main room. Money would be bequeathed to pay for continuous readings of the <a href="Qur&#39;an" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qur'an</a> in the mausoleum, and they were normally open for visitors to pay their respects. The <a href="Mausoleum_of_Khomeini" title="wikilink">Mausoleum of Khomeini</a>, still under construction in a <a href="Tehran" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tehran</a> cemetery, and intended to be the centre of a huge complex, continues these traditions.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>
<p>The tradition evolved differently in the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman</a> world, where smaller single-roomed <em><a href="t&lt;U+00FC&gt;rbe" class="uri" title="wikilink">t&lt;U+00FC&gt;rbe</a></em> typically stand on the grounds of mosque complexes, often built by the deceased. The sarcophagi (often purely symbolic, as the body is below the floor) may be draped in a rich pall, and surmounted by a real cloth or stone <a href="turban" class="uri" title="wikilink">turban</a>, which is also traditional at the top of ordinary <a href="Turkish_people" title="wikilink">Turkish</a> gravestones (usually in stylised form). Two of the most famous are in the <a href="S&lt;U+00FC&gt;leymaniye_Mosque" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+00FC&gt;leymaniye Mosque</a> in <a href="Istanbul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Istanbul</a>; the <a href="Ye&lt;U+015F&gt;il_T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rbe" title="wikilink">Ye&lt;U+015F&gt;il T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rbe</a> (&quot;Green Tomb&quot;) of 1421 is an unusually large example in <a href="Bursa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bursa</a>, and also unusual in having extensive tile work on the exterior, which is usually masonry, whereas the interiors are often decorated with brightly-colored tiles.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<p>Other parts of the Islamic world reflected local techniques and traditions. The 15th century royal <a href="Tomb_of_Askia" title="wikilink">Tomb of Askia</a> in <a href="Mali" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mali</a> used the local technique of mud-building to erect a 17 metre high pyramidal tomb set in a mosque complex.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> At the other end of the Islamic world, <a href="Java" title="wikilink">Javanese</a> royalty are mostly buried in royal graveyards such as those at <a href="Kota_Gede" title="wikilink">Kota Gede</a> and <a href="Imogiri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Imogiri</a>.</p>
<p>In the Arab world, mausoleums of rulers are more likely to be a side-room inside a mosque or form part of a larger complex containing perhaps a hospital, <em><a href="madrasa" class="uri" title="wikilink">madrasa</a></em> or library. Large domes, elaborately decorated inside, are common. The tomb-mosque of Sultan <a href="Qaitbay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qaitbay</a> (died 1496) is a famous example, one of many in <a href="Cairo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cairo</a>, though here the tomb chamber is unusually large compared to the whole.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a></p>

Public monuments to the dead continue to be erected, especially <a href="war_memorials" title="wikilink">war memorials</a>. Some are fairly traditional, while those reflecting more contemporary styles include the <a href="Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial" title="wikilink">Vietnam Veterans Memorial</a>, and several <a href="Holocaust_memorials" title="wikilink">Holocaust memorials</a>, such as <a href="Yad_Vashem" title="wikilink">Yad Vashem</a> in Jerusalem, the <a href="Vel%27_d%27Hiv_Roundup#Memorials_and_monuments_-_Paris" title="wikilink">Vel d'Hiv Memorial</a> in <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a> (1994), the <a href="Memorial_to_the_Murdered_Jews_of_Europe" title="wikilink">Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe</a> in Berlin (2004), and the <a href="Judenplatz_Holocaust_Memorial" title="wikilink">Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial</a> in Vienna (2000). These are in notable contrast to the style of most war memorials to the military of World War II; earlier modernist memorials to the dead of World War I were sometimes removed after a time as inappropriate.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> Some war memorials, especially in countries like Germany, have had a turbulent political history, for example the much-rededicated <a href="Neue_Wache" title="wikilink">Neue Wache</a> in Berlin.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> Several critics detect a crisis in public memorial style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to <a href="genocide" class="uri" title="wikilink">genocide</a>, at least on the Western side of the <a href="Iron_Curtain" title="wikilink">Iron Curtain</a>.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> In the <a href="Communist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Communist</a> East the established style of <a href="Socialist_Realism" title="wikilink">Socialist Realism</a> was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> The generation of abstracted and <a href="Conceptual_art" title="wikilink">conceptual</a> war and <a href="Holocaust" class="uri" title="wikilink">Holocaust</a> memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
<p>Many large mausoleums have been constructed for political leaders, including <a href="Lenin&#39;s_Mausoleum" title="wikilink">Lenin's Mausoleum</a> and those for <a href="An&lt;U+0131&gt;tkabir" title="wikilink">Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk</a>, <a href="Mazar-e-Quaid" title="wikilink">Jinnah</a>, <a href="Kumsusan_Memorial_Palace" title="wikilink">Kim Il-Sung</a>, <a href="Mausoleo_Che_Guevara" title="wikilink">Che Guevara</a> and several <a href="Presidential_memorials_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Presidential memorials in the United States</a>. The Mausoleum of Khomeini is a grand mosque complex, as large as any medieval example, not least because it includes a 20,000 place parking lot.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>
