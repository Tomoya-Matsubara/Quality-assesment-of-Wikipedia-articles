<p><strong>Bob Dylan</strong> (born <strong>Robert Allen Zimmerman</strong>, <a href="May_24" title="wikilink">May 24</a>, <a href="1941" class="uri" title="wikilink">1941</a>) is an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="singer-songwriter" class="uri" title="wikilink">singer-songwriter</a>, <a href="author" class="uri" title="wikilink">author</a>, <a href="musician" class="uri" title="wikilink">musician</a>, <a href="poet" class="uri" title="wikilink">poet</a>, and, of late, <a href="disc_jockey" title="wikilink">disc jockey</a> who has been a major figure in <a href="popular_music" title="wikilink">popular music</a> for five decades. Much of Dylan's most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when he became an informal chronicler and a reluctant <a href="Figurehead_(metaphor)" title="wikilink">figurehead</a> of American unrest. A number of his songs, such as &quot;<a href="Blowin&#39;_in_the_Wind" title="wikilink">Blowin' in the Wind</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="The_Times_They_Are_a-Changin&#39;_(song)" title="wikilink">The Times They Are a-Changin'</a>&quot;,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> became <a href="anthem" title="wikilink">anthems</a> of the <a href="anti-war" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-war</a> and <a href="American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955-1968)" title="wikilink">civil rights movements</a>. His most recent studio album, <em><a href="Modern_Times_(Bob_Dylan_album)" title="wikilink">Modern Times</a></em>, released on <a href="August_29" title="wikilink">August 29</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, entered the U.S. <a href="album_charts" title="wikilink">album charts</a> at #1, making him, at age 65, the oldest living person to top those charts.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It was later named Album of the Year by <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> magazine.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Dylan's early lyrics incorporated <a href="politics" class="uri" title="wikilink">politics</a>, <a href="social_commentary" title="wikilink">social commentary</a>, <a href="philosophy" class="uri" title="wikilink">philosophy</a> and <a href="literature" title="wikilink">literary</a> influences, defying existing <a href="pop_music" title="wikilink">pop music</a> conventions and appealing widely to the <a href="counterculture" class="uri" title="wikilink">counterculture</a> of the time. While expanding and personalizing musical styles, he has shown steadfast devotion to many traditions of American song, from <a href="folk_music" title="wikilink">folk</a> and <a href="American_country_music" title="wikilink">country</a>/<a href="blues" class="uri" title="wikilink">blues</a> to <a href="gospel_music" title="wikilink">gospel</a>, <a href="rock_and_roll" title="wikilink">rock and roll</a> and <a href="rockabilly" class="uri" title="wikilink">rockabilly</a>, to <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a>, <a href="Scotland" title="wikilink">Scottish</a> and <a href="Ireland" title="wikilink">Irish</a> folk music, even <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a> and <a href="swing_(genre)" title="wikilink">swing</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Dylan performs with the <a href="guitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitar</a>, <a href="electronic_keyboard" title="wikilink">keyboard</a> and <a href="harmonica" class="uri" title="wikilink">harmonica</a>. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the &quot;<a href="Never_Ending_Tour" title="wikilink">Never Ending Tour</a>&quot;. He has also performed alongside other major artists, such as <a href="John_Fogerty" title="wikilink">John Fogerty</a>, <a href="The_Band" title="wikilink">The Band</a>, <a href="Tom_Petty" title="wikilink">Tom Petty</a>, <a href="Joan_Baez" title="wikilink">Joan Baez</a>, <a href="George_Harrison" title="wikilink">George Harrison</a>, <a href="The_Grateful_Dead" title="wikilink">The Grateful Dead</a>, <a href="Johnny_Cash" title="wikilink">Johnny Cash</a>, <a href="Willie_Nelson" title="wikilink">Willie Nelson</a>, <a href="Paul_Simon" title="wikilink">Paul Simon</a>, <a href="Eric_Clapton" title="wikilink">Eric Clapton</a>, <a href="Patti_Smith" title="wikilink">Patti Smith</a>, <a href="Emmylou_Harris" title="wikilink">Emmylou Harris</a>, <a href="Bruce_Springsteen" title="wikilink">Bruce Springsteen</a>, <a href="U2" class="uri" title="wikilink">U2</a>, <a href="The_Rolling_Stones" title="wikilink">The Rolling Stones</a>, <a href="Joni_Mitchell" title="wikilink">Joni Mitchell</a>, <a href="Jack_White" title="wikilink">Jack White</a>, <a href="Merle_Haggard" title="wikilink">Merle Haggard</a>, <a href="Jeff_Lynne" title="wikilink">Jeff Lynne</a>, <a href="Neil_Young" title="wikilink">Neil Young</a>, <a href="Van_Morrison" title="wikilink">Van Morrison</a>, <a href="Ringo_Starr" title="wikilink">Ringo Starr</a> and <a href="Stevie_Nicks" title="wikilink">Stevie Nicks</a>. Although his accomplishments as performer and recording artist have been central to his career, his songwriting is generally regarded as his greatest contribution.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Over many years, Dylan has been recognized and honored for his songwriting, performing, and recording. His records have earned <a href="Grammy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grammy</a>, <a href="Golden_Globe" title="wikilink">Golden Globe</a>, and <a href="Academy_Award" title="wikilink">Academy Awards</a>, and he has been inducted into the <a href="Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>, <a href="Nashville_Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame</a> and <a href="Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Songwriters Hall of Fame</a>.

<p><strong>Robert Allen Zimmerman</strong> (Jewish name: Zushe ben Avraham)<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> was born on <a href="May_24" title="wikilink">May 24</a>, <a href="1941" class="uri" title="wikilink">1941</a>, in <a href="Duluth,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Duluth</a>, <a href="Minnesota" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minnesota</a>,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and raised there and in <a href="Hibbing,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Hibbing, Minnesota</a>, on the <a href="Mesabi_Iron_Range" title="wikilink">Mesabi Iron Range</a> west of <a href="Lake_Superior" title="wikilink">Lake Superior</a>. Research by Dylan&lt;U+2019&gt;s biographers has shown that his paternal grandparents, Zigman and Anna Zimmerman, emigrated from <a href="Odessa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Odessa</a> in <a href="Ukraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ukraine</a> to the United States after the <a href="Antisemitism" title="wikilink">antisemitic</a> <a href="pogrom" title="wikilink">pogroms</a> of 1905.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Dylan himself has written (in his 2004 autobiography, <em><a href="Chronicles,_Vol._1" title="wikilink">Chronicles</a></em>) that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was <a href="Kyrgyz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kyrgyz</a> and her family originated from <a href="Istanbul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Istanbul</a>, although she grew up in the <a href="Ka&lt;U+011F&gt;&lt;U+0131&gt;zman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ka&lt;U+011F&gt;&lt;U+0131&gt;zman</a> district of <a href="Kars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kars</a> in Eastern <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a>. He also wrote that his paternal grandfather was from <a href="Trabzon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trabzon</a> on the <a href="Black_Sea" title="wikilink">Black Sea</a> coast of <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> His mother&lt;U+2019&gt;s grandparents, Benjamin and Lybba Edelstein, were <a href="Lithuanian_Jews" title="wikilink">Lithuanian Jews</a> who arrived in America in 1902.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>His parents, Abram Zimmerman and Beatrice &quot;Beatty&quot; Stone, were part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community. Zimmerman lived in Duluth until age seven. When his father was stricken with <a href="polio" class="uri" title="wikilink">polio</a>, the family returned to nearby <a href="Hibbing,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Hibbing</a>, where Zimmerman spent the rest of his childhood.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Abram was recalled by one of Bob's childhood friends as strict and unwelcoming, whereas his mother was remembered as warm and friendly.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Zimmerman spent much of his youth listening to the radio &lt;U+2014&gt; first to the powerful <a href="blues" class="uri" title="wikilink">blues</a> and <a href="American_country_music" title="wikilink">country</a> stations broadcasting from <a href="Shreveport,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Shreveport, Louisiana</a> and, later, to early <a href="rock_and_roll" title="wikilink">rock and roll</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> He formed several bands in high school: the first, The Shadow Blasters, was short-lived; but his next band, The Golden Chords, lasted longer playing <a href="Cover_version" title="wikilink">covers</a> of popular songs. Their performance of <a href="Danny_and_the_Juniors" title="wikilink">Danny and the Juniors</a>' &quot;Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay&quot; at their high school talent show was so loud that the principal cut the microphone off.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In his 1959 school year book, Robert Zimmerman listed as his ambition &quot;To join <a href="Little_Richard" title="wikilink">Little Richard</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The same year, using the name Elston Gunnn,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> he performed two dates with <a href="Bobby_Vee" title="wikilink">Bobby Vee</a>, playing piano and providing handclaps.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Zimmerman enrolled at the <a href="University_of_Minnesota" title="wikilink">University of Minnesota</a> in September 1959, moving to <a href="Minneapolis,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Minneapolis</a>. His early focus on rock and roll gave way to an interest in American folk music, typically performed with an acoustic guitar. He has recalled, &quot;The first thing that turned me onto folk singing was <a href="Odetta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Odetta</a>. I heard a record of hers in a record store. Right then and there, I went out and traded my electric guitar and amplifier for an acoustical guitar, a flat-top Gibson.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In the sleeve notes to his album <em><a href="Biograph" class="uri" title="wikilink">Biograph</a></em>, Dylan explained the attraction folk music exerted: &quot;The thing about rock'n'roll is that for me anyway it wasn't enough...There were great catch-phrases and driving pulse rhythms...but the songs weren't serious or didn't reflect life in a realistic way. I knew that when I got into folk music, it was more of a serious type of thing. The songs are filled with more despair, more sadness, more triumph, more faith in the supernatural, much deeper feelings.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> He soon began to perform at the 10 O'clock Scholar, a coffee house a few blocks from campus, and became actively involved in the local <a href="Dinkytown,_USA" title="wikilink">Dinkytown</a> <a href="folk_music" title="wikilink">folk music</a> circuit, fraternizing with local folk enthusiasts and occasionally &quot;borrowing&quot; many of their albums.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>During his Dinkytown days, Zimmerman began introducing himself as &quot;Bob Dylan&quot;. In his autobiography, <em>Chronicles</em> (2004), he wrote, &quot;What I was going to do as soon as I left home was just call myself Robert Allen.... It sounded like a Scottish king and I liked it.&quot; However, by reading <em>Downbeat</em> magazine, he discovered that there was already a saxophonist called David Allyn. Around the same time, he became acquainted with the poetry of <a href="Dylan_Thomas" title="wikilink">Dylan Thomas</a>. Zimmerman felt he had to choose between Robert Allyn and Robert Dylan. &quot;I couldn't decide &lt;U+2014&gt; the letter D came on stronger&quot;, he explained. He decided on &quot;Bob&quot; because there were several Bobbies in popular music at the time.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="relocation-to-new-york-and-record-deal">Relocation to New York and record deal</h3>
<p>Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his freshman year. He stayed in Minneapolis, working the folk circuit there with temporary journeys to <a href="Denver,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Denver, Colorado</a>; <a href="Madison,_Wisconsin" title="wikilink">Madison, Wisconsin</a>; and <a href="Chicago" title="wikilink">Chicago, Illinois</a>. In January 1961, he moved to <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, to perform there and to visit his ailing musical idol <a href="Woody_Guthrie" title="wikilink">Woody Guthrie</a>, who was then dying in a New Jersey <a href="Greystone_Park_Psychiatric_Hospital" title="wikilink">hospital</a>. Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and was the biggest influence on his early performances. Dylan would later say of Guthrie's work, &quot;You could listen to his songs and actually learn how to live.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In the hospital room, Dylan met Woody's old road-buddy <a href="Ramblin&#39;_Jack_Elliott" title="wikilink">Ramblin' Jack Elliott</a>, who was visiting Guthrie the day after returning from his own trip to Europe. Dylan and Elliott became friends, and much of Guthrie's repertoire was actually channeled through Elliott. Dylan paid tribute to Elliott in <em><a href="Chronicles,_Vol._1" title="wikilink">Chronicles</a></em> (2004).<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>From April to September 1961, he played at various clubs around <a href="Greenwich_Village" title="wikilink">Greenwich Village</a> <a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and on 29th July, 1961 he was broadcast on the WRVR radio programme &quot;Saturday Of Folk Music&quot; playing <a href="Eric_von_Schmidt" title="wikilink">Eric von Schmidt</a>'s &quot;Acne&quot; in duet with Ramblin' Jack Elliott <a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a>, duetting with <a href="Danny_Kalb" title="wikilink">Danny Kalb</a> on &quot;Mean Old Southern Man,&quot; and covering three traditional folk songs (&quot;Handsome Molly,&quot; &quot;<a href="Omie_Wise" title="wikilink">Omie Wise</a>,&quot; and &quot;Poor Lazarus&quot;) <a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a>. Dylan gained some public recognition after a positive review<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> in <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> by critic <a href="Robert_Shelton_(critic)" title="wikilink">Robert Shelton</a> of a show he played at <a href="Gerde&#39;s_Folk_City" title="wikilink">Gerde's Folk City</a> in September. Also in September, Dylan was invited to play harmonica by folk singer <a href="Carolyn_Hester" title="wikilink">Carolyn Hester</a> on her third album, entitled <em>Carolyn Hester</em>. This brought Dylan's talents to the attention of <a href="John_H._Hammond" title="wikilink">John Hammond</a>, who was producing Hester's album<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> for <a href="Columbia_Records" title="wikilink">Columbia Records</a>. Hammond signed Dylan to Columbia that October. The performances on his first Columbia album <em><a href="Bob_Dylan_(album)" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan</a></em> (1962), consisted of familiar folk, blues and <a href="gospel_music" title="wikilink">gospel</a> material combined with two of his own songs. Dylan's first album made little impact, selling only 5,000 copies in its first year, just enough to break even. Within <a href="Columbia_Records" title="wikilink">Columbia Records</a> some referred to the singer as 'Hammond's Folly' and suggested dropping his contract. Hammond defended Dylan vigorously, and <a href="Johnny_Cash" title="wikilink">Johnny Cash</a> was also a powerful ally of Dylan at Columbia.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> While Dylan continued to work for Columbia, he also recorded more than a dozen songs, under the pseudonym Blind Boy Grunt, for <em><a href="Broadside_Magazine" title="wikilink">Broadside Magazine</a></em>, a folk music magazine and record label.</p>
<p>Dylan made two important career moves in August 1962. He went to the <a href="New_York_Supreme_Court" title="wikilink">Supreme Court</a> building in New York and changed his name to Robert Dylan. In the same month, he also signed a management contract with <a href="Albert_Grossman" title="wikilink">Albert Grossman</a>. Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was notable both for his sometimes confrontational personality, and for the fiercely protective loyalty he displayed towards his principal client.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In the documentary <em><a href="No_Direction_Home" title="wikilink">No Direction Home</a></em>, Dylan described Grossman thus: &quot;He was kind of like a <a href="Colonel_Tom_Parker" title="wikilink">Colonel Tom Parker</a> figure...you could smell him coming.&quot;</p>
<p>By the time Dylan's second album, <em><a href="The_Freewheelin&#39;_Bob_Dylan" title="wikilink">The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan</a></em>, was released in May 1963, he had begun making his name as both a singer and a songwriter. Many of the songs on this album were labelled <a href="protest_song" title="wikilink">protest songs</a>, inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by <a href="Pete_Seeger" title="wikilink">Pete Seeger</a>'s passion for topical songs.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> &quot;Oxford Town&quot;, for example, was a sardonic account of <a href="James_Meredith" title="wikilink">James Meredith</a>'s ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the <a href="University_of_Mississippi" title="wikilink">University of Mississippi</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>His most famous song of the time, &quot;<a href="Blowin&#39;_in_the_Wind" title="wikilink">Blowin' in the Wind</a>&quot;, partially derived its melody from the traditional <a href="slave" class="uri" title="wikilink">slave</a> song &quot;No More Auction Block&quot;, while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo. The song was widely recorded and became an international hit for <a href="Peter,_Paul_and_Mary" title="wikilink">Peter, Paul and Mary</a>, setting a precedent for many other artists who would have hits with Dylan's songs. While Dylan's topical songs solidified his early reputation, <em>Freewheelin</em>' also included a mixture of love songs and jokey, surreal talking blues. Humor was a large part of Dylan's persona,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> and the range of material on the album impressed many listeners, including <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a>. <a href="George_Harrison" title="wikilink">George Harrison</a> said, &quot;We just played it, just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude &lt;U+2014&gt; it was incredibly original and wonderful.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> <img src="Joan_Baez_Bob_Dylan.jpg" title="fig:With Joan Baez during the Civil Rights March in Washington, D.C., August 28, 1963" alt="With Joan Baez during the Civil Rights March in Washington, D.C., August 28, 1963" /></p>
<p>The <em>Freewheelin</em>' song &quot;<a href="A_Hard_Rain&#39;s_a-Gonna_Fall" title="wikilink">A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall</a>&quot;, built melodically from a loose adaptation of the folk <a href="ballad" class="uri" title="wikilink">ballad</a> &quot;<a href="Lord_Randall" title="wikilink">Lord Randall</a>&quot;, with its veiled references to <a href="nuclear_warfare" title="wikilink">nuclear</a> <a href="apocalypse" class="uri" title="wikilink">apocalypse</a>, gained even more resonance as the <a href="Cuban_Missile_Crisis" title="wikilink">Cuban missile crisis</a> developed only a few weeks after Dylan began performing it.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Like &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot;, &quot;A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall&quot; marked an important new direction in modern songwriting, blending a <a href="Stream_of_consciousness_writing" title="wikilink">stream-of-consciousness</a>, <a href="imagist" class="uri" title="wikilink">imagist</a> lyrical attack with traditional folk progressions.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>Freewheelin</em> album presented Dylan as a singer accompanying himself on acoustic guitar. But other tracks recorded at these sessions, with a backing band, showed a willingness to experiment with a <a href="rockabilly" class="uri" title="wikilink">rockabilly</a> sound. 'Mixed Up Confusion' was released as a single and then quickly withdrawn. <a href="Cameron_Crowe" title="wikilink">Cameron Crowe</a> described it as &quot;a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards <a href="Elvis_Presley" title="wikilink">Elvis Presley</a> and <a href="Sun_Records" title="wikilink">Sun Records</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Soon after the release of <em>Freewheelin</em>, Dylan emerged as a dominant figure of the so-called &quot;new folk movement&quot; centered in <a href="Greenwich_Village" title="wikilink">Greenwich Village</a>. Dylan's singing voice was untrained and had an unusual edge to it, yet it was suited to the interpretation of traditional songs. Robert Shelton described Dylan's vocal style as &quot;a rusty voice suggesting Guthrie's old performances, etched in gravel like <a href="Dave_Van_Ronk" title="wikilink">Dave Van Ronk</a>'s&quot;<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Many of his most famous early songs first reached the public through other performers' versions that were more immediately palatable. <a href="Joan_Baez" title="wikilink">Joan Baez</a> became Dylan's advocate, as well as his lover. Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to national and international prominence, jumpstarting his performance career by inviting him onstage during her own concerts, and recording several of his early songs.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Others who recorded and had hits with Dylan's songs in the early and mid-1960s included <a href="The_Byrds" title="wikilink">The Byrds</a>, <a href="Sonny_and_Cher" title="wikilink">Sonny and Cher</a>, <a href="The_Hollies" title="wikilink">The Hollies</a>, <a href="Peter,_Paul_and_Mary" title="wikilink">Peter, Paul and Mary</a>, <a href="Manfred_Mann" title="wikilink">Manfred Mann</a>, and <a href="The_Turtles" title="wikilink">The Turtles</a>. Most attempted to impart a pop feel and rhythm to the songs, while Dylan and Baez performed them mostly as sparse folk pieces, keying rhythmically off the vocals.

Dylan had chosen to perform &quot;Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues&quot; but was informed by the 'head of program practices' at <a href="CBS_Television" title="wikilink">CBS Television</a> that this song was potentially libellous to the <a href="John_Birch_Society" title="wikilink">John Birch Society</a>. Rather than comply with TV censorship, Dylan refused to appear.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> His next album, <em><a href="The_Times_They_Are_a-Changin&#39;" title="wikilink">The Times They Are a-Changin'</a></em>, reflected a more sophisticated, politicized and cynical Dylan. This bleak material, addressing such subjects as the murder of civil rights worker <a href="Medgar_Evers" title="wikilink">Medgar Evers</a> and the despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities (&quot;Ballad of Hollis Brown&quot;, &quot;<a href="North_Country_Blues" title="wikilink">North Country Blues</a>&quot;), was accompanied by two love songs, &quot;Boots of Spanish Leather&quot; and &quot;One Too Many Mornings&quot;, and the renunciation of &quot;Restless Farewell&quot;.

Though never explicitly mentioning their respective races, the song leaves no doubt that the killer is white and the victim is black.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>By the end of 1963, Dylan felt both manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements. Accepting the &quot;<a href="Thomas_Paine" title="wikilink">Tom Paine</a> Award&quot; from the <a href="National_Emergency_Civil_Liberties_Committee" title="wikilink">National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee</a> at a ceremony shortly after the assassination of <a href="John_F._Kennedy" title="wikilink">John F.

<p>His next album, <em><a href="Another_Side_of_Bob_Dylan" title="wikilink">Another Side of Bob Dylan</a></em>, recorded on a single June evening in 1964, had a lighter mood than its predecessor. The surreal Dylan reemerged on &quot;I Shall Be Free #10&quot; and &quot;Motorpsycho Nightmare&quot;, accompanied by a sense of humour that has often reappeared over the years. &quot;<a href="Spanish_Harlem_Incident" title="wikilink">Spanish Harlem Incident</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="To_Ramona" title="wikilink">To Ramona</a>&quot; are romantic and passionate love songs, while &quot;<a href="Black_Crow_Blues" title="wikilink">Black Crow Blues</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="I_Don&#39;t_Believe_You_(She_Acts_Like_We_Never_Have_Met)" title="wikilink">I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)</a>&quot; suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate Dylan's music. &quot;It Ain't Me Babe&quot;, on the surface a song about spurned love, has been described as a thinly disguised rejection of the role his reputation had thrust at him. His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the <a href="impressionism" title="wikilink">impressionistic</a> &quot;<a href="Chimes_of_Freedom" title="wikilink">Chimes of Freedom</a>&quot;, which sets elements of social commentary against a denser metaphorical landscape in a style later characterized by <a href="Allen_Ginsberg" title="wikilink">Allen Ginsberg</a> as &quot;chains of flashing images&quot;; and &quot;<a href="My_Back_Pages" title="wikilink">My Back Pages</a>&quot;, which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions as he took a new direction.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>During 1964 and 1965, Dylan&lt;U+2019&gt;s appearance changed rapidly, as he made his move from leading contemporary song-writer of the folk scene to rock&lt;U+2019&gt;n&lt;U+2019&gt;roll star. His scruffy jeans and work shirts were replaced by a <a href="Carnaby_Street" title="wikilink">Carnaby Street</a> wardrobe. A London reporter wrote: &lt;U+201C&gt;Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of Leicester Square. He looks like an undernourished cockatoo.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Dylan also began to play with frequently hapless interviewers in increasingly cruel and surreal ways. Appearing on the <a href="Les_Crane" title="wikilink">Les Crane</a> TV show and asked about a movie he was planning to make, he told Crane it would be a cowboy horror movie. Asked if he played the cowboy, Dylan replied. &lt;U+201C&gt;No, I play my mother.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

<p>His March 1965 album <em><a href="Bringing_It_All_Back_Home" title="wikilink">Bringing It All Back Home</a></em> was yet another stylistic leap.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The album featured his first recordings made with electric instruments. The first single, &quot;<a href="Subterranean_Homesick_Blues" title="wikilink">Subterranean Homesick Blues</a>&quot;, owed much to <a href="Chuck_Berry" title="wikilink">Chuck Berry</a>'s &quot;Too Much Monkey Business&quot; and was provided with an early <a href="music_video" title="wikilink">music video</a> courtesy of <a href="D._A._Pennebaker" title="wikilink">D.

<p>The <a href="B_side" title="wikilink">B side</a> of the album was a different matter. It included four lengthy acoustic songs whose undogmatic political, social, and personal concerns are illuminated with the semi-mystical imagery that became another Dylan trademark. One of these tracks, &quot;<a href="Mr._Tambourine_Man" title="wikilink">Mr. Tambourine Man</a>&quot;, which would become one of his best known songs, had already been a hit for The Byrds; while &quot;Gates of Eden&quot;, &quot;<a href="It&#39;s_All_Over_Now_Baby_Blue" title="wikilink">It's All Over Now Baby Blue</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="It&#39;s_Alright_Ma_(I&#39;m_Only_Bleeding)" title="wikilink">It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)</a>&quot; have been fixtures in Dylan's live performances for most of his career.</p>
<p>That summer Dylan made history by performing his first electric set (since his high school days) with a <a href="pickup_group" title="wikilink">pickup group</a> drawn mostly from the <a href="Paul_Butterfield_Blues_Band" title="wikilink">Paul Butterfield Blues Band</a>, featuring <a href="Mike_Bloomfield" title="wikilink">Mike Bloomfield</a> (guitar), Sam Lay (drums), Jerome Arnold (bass), plus <a href="Al_Kooper" title="wikilink">Al Kooper</a> (organ) and <a href="Barry_Goldberg" title="wikilink">Barry Goldberg</a> (piano), while headlining at the <a href="Newport_Folk_Festival" title="wikilink">Newport Folk Festival</a> (see <em><a href="The_electric_Dylan_controversy" title="wikilink">The electric Dylan controversy</a></em>).<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Dylan had appeared at Newport twice before, in 1963 and 1964, and two wildly divergent accounts of the crowd's response in 1965 emerged. The settled fact is that Dylan, met with a mix of cheering and booing, left the stage after only three songs. As one version of the legend has it, the boos were from the outraged folk fans whom Dylan had alienated by his electric guitar. An alternative account claims audience members were merely upset by poor sound quality and a surprisingly short set. Whatever sparked the crowd's disfavor, Dylan soon reemerged and sang two much better received solo acoustic numbers, &quot;It's All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot; and &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man.&quot; His choice of the former has often been described as a carefully selected death knell for the kind of consciously sociopolitical, purely acoustic music that the cat-callers were demanding of him, with &quot;New Folk&quot; in the role of &quot;Baby Blue&quot;.</p>
<p>Dylan's 1965 Newport performance provoked an outraged response from the folk music establishment.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> <a href="Ewan_MacColl" title="wikilink">Ewan MacColl</a> wrote in <em><a href="Sing_Out!" title="wikilink">Sing Out!</a>,</em> &quot;Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside traditions formulated over time... But what of Bobby Dylan?... Only a non-critical audience, nourished on the watery pap of pop music could have fallen for such tenth-rate drivel.&quot; On <a href="July_29" title="wikilink">July 29</a>, just four days after his controversial performance at Newport, Dylan was back into the studio in New York and recorded &quot;Positively 4th Street.&quot; The song teemed with images of paranoia and revenge. (&quot;I know the reason/That you talk behind my back/I used to be among the crowd/You're in with.&quot;) It was widely interpreted as Dylan's put-down of former friends from the folk community &lt;U+2014&gt; friends he had known in the clubs along West 4th Street.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>Many in the folk revival had embraced the idea that life equaled art, that a certain kind of life defined by suffering and social exclusion in fact replaced art.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Folksong collectors and singers often presented folk music as an innocent characteristic of lives lived without reflection or the false consciousness of capitalism.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> This philosophy, both genteel and paternalistic, was ultimately what Dylan had run afoul of by 1965. But at an Austin press conference in September of that year, on the day of his first performance with <a href="Levon_and_the_Hawks" title="wikilink">Levon and the Hawks</a>, he described his music not as a pop charts-bound break with the past, but as &lt;U+201C&gt;historical-traditional music.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Dylan later told interviewer <a href="Nat_Hentoff" title="wikilink">Nat Hentoff</a>: &lt;U+201C&gt;What folk music is... is based on myths and the Bible and plague and famine and all kinds of things like that which are nothing but mystery and you can see it in all the songs&lt;U+2026&gt;.All these songs about roses growing out of people&lt;U+2019&gt;s brains and lovers who are really geese and swans that turn into angels&lt;U+2026&gt;and seven years of this and eight years of that and it&lt;U+2019&gt;s all really something that nobody can touch.... (the songs) are not going to die.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> It was this mystical, living tradition of songs that served as the palette for <em>Bringing It All Back Home</em>, but in a nod to changing times first openly displayed at Newport, electrically amplified instruments would now become part of the mix.</p>

<p>In July 1965, Dylan released the single &quot;<a href="Like_a_Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Like a Rolling Stone</a>&quot;, which peaked at #2 in the U.S. and at #4 in the UK charts. At over six minutes in length, this song has been widely credited with altering attitudes about what a pop single could convey. <a href="Bruce_Springsteen" title="wikilink">Bruce Springsteen</a> said that on first hearing this single, &lt;U+201C&gt;that snare shot sounded like somebody&lt;U+2019&gt;d kicked open the door to your mind&lt;U+2026&gt; I knew that I was listening to the toughest voice that I had ever heard.&lt;U+201C&gt;<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> In 2004, <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> magazine listed it at number one on its list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Its signature sound &lt;U+2014&gt; with a full, jangling band and an organ riff &lt;U+2014&gt; also characterized his next album, <em><a href="Highway_61_Revisited" title="wikilink">Highway 61 Revisited</a>,</em> titled after the road that led from Dylan's native Minnesota to the musical hotbed of <a href="New_Orleans,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a>. The songs passed stylistically through the birthplace of blues, the <a href="Mississippi_Delta" title="wikilink">Mississippi Delta</a>, and referenced a number of <a href="blues" class="uri" title="wikilink">blues</a> songs, including <a href="Fred_McDowell" title="wikilink">Mississippi Fred McDowell's</a> &quot;61 Highway&quot;. The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, with surreal litanies of the grotesque flavored by <a href="Mike_Bloomfield" title="wikilink">Mike Bloomfield</a>'s blues guitar, a rhythm section, and Dylan's obvious enjoyment of the sessions. The closing song, &quot;<a href="Desolation_Row" title="wikilink">Desolation Row</a>&quot;, is an apocalyptic vision with references to many figures of <a href="Western_culture" title="wikilink">Western culture</a>. <img src="Music_blonde_on_blonde.jpg" title="fig:A mix of folk music, rock and roll and Dylan&#39;s own brand of surrealism, Blonde on Blonde (1966) is often considered one of the finest recordings of American popular music." alt="A mix of folk music, rock and roll and Dylan&#39;s own brand of surrealism, Blonde on Blonde (1966) is often considered one of the finest recordings of American popular music." width="150" /></p>
<p>In support of the record, Dylan was booked for two U.S. concerts and set about assembling a band. <a href="Mike_Bloomfield" title="wikilink">Mike Bloomfield</a> was unwilling to leave the Butterfield Band, so Dylan mixed <a href="Al_Kooper" title="wikilink">Al Kooper</a> and <a href="Harvey_Brooks" title="wikilink">Harvey Brooks</a> from his studio crew with bar-band stalwarts <a href="Robbie_Robertson" title="wikilink">Robbie Robertson</a> and <a href="Levon_Helm" title="wikilink">Levon Helm</a>, best known at the time for backing <a href="Ronnie_Hawkins" title="wikilink">Ronnie Hawkins</a>. In August 1965 at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, the group was heckled by an audience who, Newport notwithstanding, still demanded the acoustic troubadour of previous years. The band's reception on <a href="September_3" title="wikilink">September 3</a> at the <a href="Hollywood_Bowl" title="wikilink">Hollywood Bowl</a> was more uniformly favorable.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>Neither Kooper nor Brooks wanted to tour with Dylan, and he was unable to lure his preferred band, a crew of west coast musicians best known for backing <a href="Johnny_Rivers" title="wikilink">Johnny Rivers</a>, featuring guitarist <a href="James_Burton" title="wikilink">James Burton</a> and drummer <a href="Mickey_Jones" title="wikilink">Mickey Jones</a>, away from their regular commitments. So Dylan then hired Robertson and Helm's full band, <a href="The_Band" title="wikilink">The Hawks</a>, as his tour group, and began a string of studio sessions with them in an effort to record the follow-up to <em>Highway 61 Revisited</em>.</p>
<p>While Dylan and the Hawks met increasingly receptive audiences on tour, their studio efforts floundered. Producer <a href="Bob_Johnston" title="wikilink">Bob Johnston</a> had been trying to persuade Dylan to record in Nashville for some time. In February 1966 Dylan agreed and Johnston surrounded him with a cadre of top-notch session men. At Dylan's insistence, Robertson and Kooper came down from <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> to play on the sessions.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The Nashville sessions produced the album <em><a href="Blonde_on_Blonde" title="wikilink">Blonde on Blonde</a></em> (1966), featuring what Dylan later called &quot;that thin wild mercury sound.&quot; <a href="Al_Kooper" title="wikilink">Al Kooper</a> said the record was a masterpiece because it was &quot;taking two cultures and smashing them together with a huge explosion&quot;: the musical world of Nashville and the world of the &quot;quintessential New York hipster&quot; Bob Dylan.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>For many critics, Dylan's mid-'60s trilogy of albums &lt;U+2014&gt; <em>Bringing It All Back Home</em>, <em>Highway 61 Revisited</em> and <em>Blonde on Blonde</em> &lt;U+2014&gt; represents one of the great cultural achievements of the 20th century. In Mike Marqusee's words: &quot;Between late 1964 and the summer of 1966, Dylan created a body of work that remains unique. Drawing on folk, blues, country, R&amp;B, rock'n'roll, gospel, British beat, symbolist, modernist and <a href="Beat_poetry" title="wikilink">Beat poetry</a>, <a href="surrealism" class="uri" title="wikilink">surrealism</a> and <a href="Dada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dada</a>, advertising jargon and social commentary, <a href="Federico_Fellini" title="wikilink">Fellini</a> and <a href="Mad_magazine" title="wikilink">Mad magazine</a>, he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision. The beauty of these albums retains the power to shock and console.&quot;<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>On November 22, 1965, Bob Dylan married Sara Lownds. Some of Dylan&lt;U+2019&gt;s friends (including <a href="Ramblin&#39;_Jack_Elliott" title="wikilink">Ramblin' Jack Elliott</a>) claim that, in conversation immediately after the event, Dylan denied that he was married.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Journalist <a href="Nora_Ephron" title="wikilink">Nora Ephron</a> first made the news public in the <a href="New_York_Post" title="wikilink">New York Post</a> in February 1966 with the headline &lt;U+201C&gt;Hush! Bob Dylan is wed.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>Dylan undertook a &quot;world tour&quot; of <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a> and Europe in the spring of 1966. Each show was split into two parts. Dylan performed solo during the first half, accompanying himself on <a href="Steel-string_guitar" title="wikilink">acoustic guitar</a> and <a href="harmonica" class="uri" title="wikilink">harmonica</a>. In the second half, backed by <a href="the_Hawks" title="wikilink">the Hawks</a>, he played high voltage electric music. This contrast provoked many fans, who jeered and slowly handclapped.</p>
<p>The tour culminated in a famously raucous confrontation between Dylan and his audience at the Manchester <a href="Free_Trade_Hall" title="wikilink">Free Trade Hall</a> in <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a> (officially released on CD in 1998 as <em><a href="The_Bootleg_Series_Vol._4:_Bob_Dylan_Live_1966,_The_&quot;Royal_Albert_Hall&quot;_Concert" title="wikilink">The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The &quot;Royal Albert Hall&quot; Concert</a></em>). At the climax of the concert, <a href="John_Cordwell" title="wikilink">one fan</a>, angry with Dylan's electric sound, shouted: &quot;<a href="Judas_Iscariot" title="wikilink">Judas</a>!&quot; and Dylan responded, &quot;I don't believe you... You're a liar!&quot; He turned to the band and, just within earshot of the microphone, said &quot;Play it fucking loud!&quot;<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> They then launched into the last song of the night with gusto &lt;U+2014&gt; &quot;Like a Rolling Stone.&quot;</p>

<p>After his European tour, Dylan returned to <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, but the pressures on him continued to increase. <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC Television</a> had paid an advance for a TV show they could screen.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> His publisher, <a href="Macmillan_Publishers" title="wikilink">Macmillan</a>, was demanding a finished manuscript of the poem/novel <em><a href="Tarantula_(book)" title="wikilink">Tarantula</a>.</em> Manager <a href="Albert_Grossman" title="wikilink">Albert Grossman</a> had already scheduled an extensive concert tour for that summer and fall. On <a href="July_29" title="wikilink">July 29</a>, <a href="1966" class="uri" title="wikilink">1966</a>, while Dylan rode his <a href="Triumph_Motorcycles" title="wikilink">Triumph</a> 500 <a href="motorcycle" class="uri" title="wikilink">motorcycle</a> in <a href="Woodstock,_New_York" title="wikilink">Woodstock, New York</a>, its brakes locked, throwing him to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never fully disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> In commenting on the significance of the crash, Dylan made it plain that he had felt exploited at that time: &lt;U+201C&gt;When I had that motorcycle accident ... I woke up and caught my senses, I realized that I was just workin' for all these leeches. And I didn't want to do that. Plus, I had a family and I just wanted to see my kids. &quot;<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>

<p>Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began editing film footage of his 1966 tour for <em><a href="Eat_the_Document" title="wikilink">Eat the Document</a></em>, a rarely exhibited follow-up to <em><a href="Dont_Look_Back" title="wikilink">Dont Look Back</a></em>.

The relaxed atmosphere yielded renditions of many of Dylan's favored old and new songs and some newly written pieces.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> These songs, initially compiled as demos for other artists to record, provided hit singles for <a href="Julie_Driscoll" title="wikilink">Julie Driscoll</a> (&quot;<a href="This_Wheel&#39;s_on_Fire_(song)" title="wikilink">This Wheel's on Fire</a>&quot;), <a href="The_Byrds" title="wikilink">The Byrds</a> (&quot;You Ain't Goin' Nowhere&quot;, &quot;Nothing Was Delivered&quot;), and <a href="Manfred_Mann" title="wikilink">Manfred Mann</a> (&quot;<a href="Quinn_the_Eskimo_(The_Mighty_Quinn)" title="wikilink">Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)</a>&quot;). Columbia belatedly released selections from them in 1975 as <em><a href="The_Basement_Tapes" title="wikilink">The Basement Tapes</a></em>. Over the years, more and more of the songs recorded by Dylan and his band in 1967 appeared on various <a href="bootleg_recording" title="wikilink">bootleg recordings</a>, culminating in a five-CD bootleg set titled <em>The Genuine Basement Tapes</em>, containing 107 songs and alternate takes.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Later in 1967, the Hawks re-named themselves <a href="The_Band" title="wikilink">The Band</a>, and independently recorded the album <em><a href="Music_from_Big_Pink" title="wikilink">Music from Big Pink</a></em>, thus beginning a long and successful recording and performing career of their own.</p>
<p>In 1997, the critic <a href="Greil_Marcus" title="wikilink">Greil Marcus</a> published an influential study of <a href="The_Basement_Tapes" title="wikilink">The Basement Tapes</a>, entitled <a href="Invisible_Republic" title="wikilink">Invisible Republic</a>.

(The book was re-published in 2001 under the title <em>The Old, Weird America</em>.)</p>
<p>In October and November 1967, Dylan returned to <a href="Nashville" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nashville</a>. Back in the recording studio after a 19 months break, he was accompanied only by <a href="Charlie_McCoy" title="wikilink">Charlie McCoy</a> on bass, <a href="Kenny_Buttrey" title="wikilink">Kenny Buttrey</a> on drums, and <a href="Pete_Drake" title="wikilink">Pete Drake</a> on steel guitar.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> At the end of the year, Dylan released <em><a href="John_Wesley_Harding_(album)" title="wikilink">John Wesley Harding</a></em>, his first album since the motorcycle crash. It was a quiet, contemplative record of shorter songs, set in a landscape that drew on both the <a href="American_West" title="wikilink">American West</a> and the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a>. The sparse structure and instrumentation, coupled with lyrics that took the Judeo-Christian tradition seriously, marked a departure not only from Dylan's own work but from the escalating psychedelic fervor of the 1960s musical culture.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> It included &quot;<a href="All_Along_the_Watchtower" title="wikilink">All Along the Watchtower</a>&quot;, with lyrics derived from the <a href="Book_of_Isaiah" title="wikilink">Book of Isaiah</a> (21:5&lt;U+2013&gt;9).

As proof, since 1974 Dylan and his bands have performed arrangements much closer to Hendrix's than to the <em>John Wesley Harding</em> version.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>

<p>Dylan's next release, <em><a href="Nashville_Skyline" title="wikilink">Nashville Skyline</a></em> (1969), was virtually a mainstream country record featuring instrumental backing by <a href="Nashville" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nashville</a> musicians, a mellow-voiced, contented Dylan, a duet with <a href="Johnny_Cash" title="wikilink">Johnny Cash</a>, and the hit single &quot;<a href="Lay_Lady_Lay" title="wikilink">Lay Lady Lay</a>&quot;, which had been originally written for the <em><a href="Midnight_Cowboy" title="wikilink">Midnight Cowboy</a></em> <a href="soundtrack" class="uri" title="wikilink">soundtrack</a>, but was not submitted in time to make the final cut. <a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a>. It was during these sessions that Dylan met <a href="Carl_Perkins" title="wikilink">Carl Perkins</a>, and co-wrote the song &quot;<a href="Champaign,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Champaign, Illinois</a>&quot; with him, which would appear on Perkin's album &quot;On Top&quot; released the following year. <a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> <a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> In May 1969, Dylan appeared on the first episode of <a href="Johnny_Cash" title="wikilink">Johnny Cash</a>'s new television show, duetting with Cash on &quot;<a href="Girl_from_the_North_Country" title="wikilink">Girl from the North Country</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="It_Ain&#39;t_Me_Babe" title="wikilink">It Ain't Me Babe</a>&quot; and &quot;Living the Blues&quot;.

<p>In the early 1970s critics charged Dylan's output was of varied and unpredictable quality. <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine writer and Dylan loyalist <a href="Greil_Marcus" title="wikilink">Greil Marcus</a> notoriously asked &quot;What is this shit?&quot; upon first listening to 1970's <em><a href="Self_Portrait" title="wikilink">Self Portrait</a></em>. In general, <em>Self Portrait</em>, a double LP including few original songs, was poorly received. Later that year, Dylan released <em><a href="New_Morning" title="wikilink">New Morning</a></em>, which some considered a return to form. In the same year Dylan co-wrote &quot;I'd Have You Anytime&quot; with <a href="George_Harrison" title="wikilink">George Harrison</a>, which appeared as the opening track on the ex-Beatle's album <a href="All_Things_Must_Pass" title="wikilink">All Things Must Pass</a> (which also included a cover of Dylan's &quot;If Not For You&quot;). His unannounced appearance at <a href="George_Harrison" title="wikilink">Harrison's</a> 1971 <em><a href="The_Concert_for_Bangladesh" title="wikilink">Concert for Bangladesh</a></em> was widely praised, particularly a snarling version of &quot;A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall&quot;. However, reports of a new album, a television special, and a return to touring came to nothing. Dylan's only other studio activity in 1970 consisted of two songs (&quot;East Virginia Blues&quot; and &quot;Nashville Skyline Rag&quot;) recorded in December with banjo-player <a href="Earl_Scruggs" title="wikilink">Earl Scruggs</a> and his sons <a href="Randy_Scruggs" title="wikilink">Randy</a> and Gary, which would eventually appear on Scruggs' 1971 album <em>Earl Scruggs Performing With His Family And Friends</em><a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Between March 16th and 19th, 1971, Dylan reserved three days at Blue Rock Studios, a small studio in New York's <a href="Greenwich_Village" title="wikilink">Greenwich Village</a>. The sessions resulted in three singles (&quot;<em>Watching The River Flow</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>When I Paint My Masterpiece</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>George Jackson</em>&quot;), but no album. The only long-player released by Dylan in either '71 or '72 was his second greatest hits compilation, &quot;<em><a href="Bob_Dylan&#39;s_Greatest_Hits_Vol._II" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II</a></em>&quot;, which included a number of re-workings of as-then unreleased <a href="Basement_Tapes" title="wikilink">Basement Tapes</a> tracks, such as &quot;<em>I Shall Be Released</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>You Ain't Goin' Nowhere</em>&quot; with <a href="Happy_Traum" title="wikilink">Happy Traum</a> on backup. In November of 1971 Dylan recorded a series of as-yet-unreleased sessions with <a href="Beat_generation" title="wikilink">Beat</a> poet <a href="Allen_Ginsberg" title="wikilink">Allen Ginsberg</a> at the <a href="Record_Plant" title="wikilink">Record Plant</a> in <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, intended for Ginsberg's &quot;Holy Soul Jelly Roll&quot; album. The sessions resulted in tracks such as the Dylan/Ginsberg compositions &quot;Vomit Express&quot;, &quot;September On Jessore Road&quot; and &quot;Jimmy Berman&quot;, as well as a number of Ginsberg originals and <a href="William_Blake" title="wikilink">William Blake</a> poems set to music. Ginsberg sang lead on most songs, with Dylan playing guitar and harmonica and providing backing vocals <a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a>.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> It is unknown at this time if the sessions will ever be released officially, however there are a number of bootlegs in circulation.</p>
<p>In 1972 Dylan signed onto <a href="Sam_Peckinpah" title="wikilink">Sam Peckinpah</a>'s film <em><a href="Pat_Garrett_and_Billy_the_Kid" title="wikilink">Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid</a></em>, providing the songs (see <a href="Pat_Garrett_and_Billy_the_Kid_(album)" title="wikilink">Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (album)</a>) and taking a role as &quot;Alias&quot;, a minor member of Billy's gang. Despite the film's failure at the box office, the song &quot;<a href="Knockin&#39;_on_Heaven&#39;s_Door_(song)" title="wikilink">Knockin' on Heaven's Door</a>&quot; has proven its durability, having been covered by over 150 recording artists.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>

A live double album of the tour, <em><a href="Before_the_Flood" title="wikilink">Before the Flood</a></em> which included Dylan with <a href="The_Band" title="wikilink">The Band</a>, was released on <a href="Asylum_Records" title="wikilink">Asylum Records</a>. Later in the mid 70s <em><a href="Before_the_Flood" title="wikilink">Before the Flood</a></em> was released by Columbia records.</p>
<p>After the tour, Dylan and his wife became publicly estranged. He filled a small red notebook with songs about his marital problems, and quickly recorded a new album entitled <em><a href="Blood_on_the_Tracks" title="wikilink">Blood on the Tracks</a></em> in September 1974.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Word of Dylan's efforts soon leaked out, and expectations were high.

<p>Released in early 1975, <em><a href="Blood_on_the_Tracks" title="wikilink">Blood on the Tracks</a></em> received mixed reviews. In the <em><a href="NME" class="uri" title="wikilink">NME</a></em>, <a href="Nick_Kent" title="wikilink">Nick Kent</a> described &quot;the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practise takes.&quot; In <em>Rolling Stone</em>, reviewer <a href="Jon_Landau" title="wikilink">Jon Landau</a> wrote that &quot;the record has been made with typical shoddiness&quot;. However, over the years critics have come to see it as one of Dylan's greatest achievements, perhaps the only serious rival to his great mid 60s trilogy of albums. In <a href="Salon.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">Salon.com</a>, Bill Wyman wrote: &quot;<em>Blood on the Tracks</em> is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-'60s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years.&quot;<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> The songs have been described as Dylan's most intimate and direct.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a><a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> A year later, Dylan recorded a duet of the song &quot;Buckets of Rain&quot; with <a href="Bette_Midler" title="wikilink">Bette Midler</a> on her <a href="Songs_for_the_New_Depression" title="wikilink">Songs for the New Depression</a> album.<a href="http://www.searchingforagem.com/Misc/Duets.htm">2</a> When Dylan was initially approached to do a duet with Midler, he wanted to record a version of &quot;Friends.&quot; While they rehearsed this song, it was the &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; closer which was eventually released.<a href="http://www.betteontheboards.com/boards/album-03.htm">3</a></p>

<p>The fall 1975 tour with the Revue also provided the backdrop to Dylan's nearly four-hour film <em><a href="Renaldo_and_Clara" title="wikilink">Renaldo and Clara</a></em>, a sprawling and improvised narrative mixed with concert footage and reminiscences.

Later in that year, Dylan allowed a two-hour edit, dominated by the concert performances, to be more widely released.</p>
<p>In November 1976 Dylan appeared at The Band's &quot;farewell&quot; concert, along with other guests including <a href="Joni_Mitchell" title="wikilink">Joni Mitchell</a>, <a href="Muddy_Waters" title="wikilink">Muddy Waters</a>, <a href="Van_Morrison" title="wikilink">Van Morrison</a> and <a href="Neil_Young" title="wikilink">Neil Young</a>. <a href="Martin_Scorsese" title="wikilink">Martin Scorsese</a>'s acclaimed<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> cinematic chronicle of this show, <em><a href="The_Last_Waltz" title="wikilink">The Last Waltz</a>,</em> was released in 1978 and included about half of Dylan's set.

<p>In the fall of 1980 Dylan briefly resumed touring, restoring several of his most popular 1960s songs to his repertoire, for a series of concerts billed as &quot;A Musical Retrospective&quot;. <em><a href="Shot_of_Love" title="wikilink">Shot of Love</a></em>, recorded the next spring, featured Dylan's first secular compositions in more than two years, mixed with explicitly Christian songs.

<p>In the 1980s the quality of Dylan's recorded work varied, from the well-regarded <em><a href="Infidels" class="uri" title="wikilink">Infidels</a></em> in 1983 to the panned <em><a href="Down_in_the_Groove" title="wikilink">Down in the Groove</a></em> in 1988. Critics such as <a href="Michael_Gray_(author)" title="wikilink">Michael Gray</a> condemned Dylan's 1980s albums both for showing an extraordinary carelessness in the studio and for failing to release his best songs.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>Infidels</em> recording sessions produced several notable outtakes, and many have questioned Dylan's judgment in leaving them off the album. Most well-regarded of these were &quot;<a href="Blind_Willie_McTell_(song)" title="wikilink">Blind Willie McTell</a>&quot; (which was both a tribute to the dead blues singer and an extraordinary evocation of African American history reaching back to &quot;the ghosts of slavery ships&quot;<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a>), &quot;Foot of Pride&quot; and &quot;Lord Protect My Child&quot;;<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> these songs were later released on the boxed set <em><a href="The_Bootleg_Series_Volumes_1-3_(Rare_&amp;_Unreleased)_1961-1991" title="wikilink">The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961-1991</a></em>.

In an arrangement set up, in part, by <a href="Debra_Byrd" title="wikilink">Debra Byrd</a> (one of Dylan's back-up singers) and Wayne K.

<p>In July 1986 Dylan released <em><a href="Knocked_Out_Loaded" title="wikilink">Knocked Out Loaded</a></em>, an album which consisted of three cover songs (by Little <a href="Junior_Parker" title="wikilink">Junior Parker</a>, <a href="Kris_Kristofferson" title="wikilink">Kris Kristofferson</a> and the traditional gospel hymn &quot;<a href="Precious_Memories" title="wikilink">Precious Memories</a>&quot;), three collaborations with other songwriters (<a href="Tom_Petty" title="wikilink">Tom Petty</a>, <a href="Sam_Shepard" title="wikilink">Sam Shepard</a> and <a href="Carole_Bayer_Sager" title="wikilink">Carole Bayer Sager</a>), and two solo compositions by Dylan himself.

Since then, some critics have called the eleven minute epic that Dylan co-wrote with Sam Shepard, '<a href="Brownsville_Girl" title="wikilink">Brownsville Girl</a>', a work of genius<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a>, and some websites have even tried to claim that the entire album has been vastly underrated<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In 1986 and 1987, Dylan toured extensively with <a href="Tom_Petty" title="wikilink">Tom Petty</a> and The Heartbreakers, sharing vocals with Petty on several songs each night. The tour was filmed for the documentary <em>Hard to Handle</em><a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a>, directed by <a href="Gillian_Armstrong" title="wikilink">Gillian Armstrong</a>. Dylan also toured with <a href="Grateful_Dead" title="wikilink">The Grateful Dead</a> in 1987, resulting in a live album <a href="Dylan_&amp;_The_Dead" title="wikilink">Dylan &amp; The Dead</a>. This album received some negative reviews.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> After performing with these different musical permutations, Dylan initiated what came to be called The <a href="Never_Ending_Tour" title="wikilink">Never Ending Tour</a> on June 7, 1988, performing with a tight back-up band featuring guitarist <a href="G._E._Smith" title="wikilink">G. E. Smith</a>. Dylan would keep on touring with this small but constantly evolving band for the next 19 years.</p>
<p>In 1987 Dylan starred in <a href="Richard_Marquand" title="wikilink">Richard Marquand</a>'s movie <em><a href="Hearts_of_Fire" title="wikilink">Hearts of Fire</a></em>, in which he played a washed-up-rock-star-turned-chicken farmer called &quot;Billy Parker&quot;, whose teenage lover (<a href="Fiona_(singer)" title="wikilink">Fiona</a>) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation (<a href="Rupert_Everett" title="wikilink">Rupert Everett</a>). Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack - &quot;<em>Night After Night</em>&quot;, and <em>'I Had a Dream About You, Baby</em>&quot; - as well as a cover of <a href="John_Hiatt" title="wikilink">John Hiatt</a>'s &quot;<em>The Usual</em>&quot;. The film was a critical and commercial flop.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
<p>Dylan was inducted into the <a href="Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in January 1988. <a href="Bruce_Springsteen" title="wikilink">Bruce Springsteen</a> made the induction speech, declaring: &quot;Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.&quot;<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> Later that spring, Dylan joined <a href="Roy_Orbison" title="wikilink">Roy Orbison</a>, <a href="Jeff_Lynne" title="wikilink">Jeff Lynne</a>, <a href="Tom_Petty" title="wikilink">Tom Petty</a>, and <a href="George_Harrison" title="wikilink">George Harrison</a> to create a lighthearted, well-selling <a href="Traveling_Wilburys_Vol._1" title="wikilink">album</a> as the <a href="Traveling_Wilburys" title="wikilink">Traveling Wilburys</a>.

<p>Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with the <a href="Daniel_Lanois" title="wikilink">Daniel Lanois</a>-produced <em><a href="Oh_Mercy" title="wikilink">Oh Mercy</a></em> (1989).<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> Lanois's influence is audible throughout <em>Oh Mercy</em>.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a><a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> The track &quot;Most of the Time&quot;, a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film <em><a href="High_Fidelity_(film)" title="wikilink">High Fidelity</a></em>, while &quot;What Was It You Wanted?&quot; has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> The dense religious imagery of 'Ring Them Bells' struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith. Scott Marshall wrote: &quot;When Dylan sings that 'The sun is going down upon the sacred cow', it's safe to assume that the sacred cow here is the biblical metaphor for all false gods. For Dylan, the world will eventually know that there is only one God.&quot;<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> Dylan also made a number of music videos during this period, but only &quot;Political World&quot; found any regular airtime on <a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a>.</p>

The album was dedicated to &quot;Gabby Goo Goo&quot;, and contained several apparently simple songs, including &quot;Under the Red Sky&quot; and &quot;Wiggle Wiggle&quot;. The &quot;Gabby Goo Goo&quot; dedication was later explained as a nickname for Dylan's four-year-old daughter.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> Sidemen on the album included <a href="George_Harrison" title="wikilink">George Harrison</a>, <a href="Slash_(musician)" title="wikilink">Slash</a> from <a href="Guns_N&#39;_Roses" title="wikilink">Guns N' Roses</a>, <a href="David_Crosby" title="wikilink">David Crosby</a>, <a href="Bruce_Hornsby" title="wikilink">Bruce Hornsby</a>, <a href="Stevie_Ray_Vaughan" title="wikilink">Stevie Ray Vaughan</a>, and <a href="Elton_John" title="wikilink">Elton John</a>.

<p>The next few years saw Dylan returning to his roots with two albums covering old folk and blues numbers: <em><a href="Good_as_I_Been_to_You" title="wikilink">Good as I Been to You</a></em> (1992) and <em><a href="World_Gone_Wrong" title="wikilink">World Gone Wrong</a></em> (1993), featuring interpretations and acoustic guitar work. Many critics and fans commented on the quiet beauty of the song &quot;Lone Pilgrim&quot;,<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> penned by a 19th century teacher and sung by Dylan with a haunting reverence. An exception to this rootsy mood came in Dylan's 1991 songwriting collaboration with <a href="Michael_Bolton" title="wikilink">Michael Bolton</a>; the resulting song &quot;Steel Bars&quot;, was released on Bolton's album <em><a href="Time,_Love_&amp;_Tenderness" title="wikilink">Time, Love &amp; Tenderness</a></em>.

<p>Between &quot;<em>Love and Theft</em>&quot; and Dylan's next studio album (to be released five years later) he recorded songs - both originals and covers - for a number of different projects. &quot;<em>I Can't Get You Off of My Mind</em>&quot;, Dylan's contribution to the <a href="Hank_Williams" title="wikilink">Hank Williams</a> tribute album &quot;Timeless&quot; was released in September 2001. 2002 saw the release of Dylan's version of &quot;Train Of Love&quot; on a similar <a href="Johnny_Cash" title="wikilink">Johnny Cash</a> tribute album called &quot;<em><a href="Kindred_Spirits:_A_Tribute_to_the_Songs_of_Johnny_Cash" title="wikilink">Kindred Spirits</a></em>&quot;.

To the dismay of some fans,<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a> Dylan refuses to be a nostalgia act; his reworked arrangements, evolving bands and experimental vocal approaches keep the music unpredictable night after night. Some fans have complained that, as Dylan's vocal range has diminished, he has resorted to a technique they have labelled 'upsinging'. One critic described the technique as Dylan's &quot;dismantling melodies by delivering phrases in a monotone and ending them an octave higher&quot;.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a></p>
<p>For a two and a half year period, between 2003 and 2006, Dylan ceased playing guitar, and stuck to the keyboard during concerts. Various rumors circulated as to why Dylan gave up guitar during this period, none very reliable. According to David Gates, a <a href="Newsweek" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newsweek</a> reporter who interviewed Dylan in 2004, &quot;...basically it has to do with his guitar not giving him quite the fullness of sound he was wanting at the bottom. (Six strings on a guitar, ten fingers on a piano.) He's thought of hiring a keyboard player so he doesn't have to do it himself, but hasn't been able to figure out who. Most keyboard players, he says, like to be soloists, and he wants a very basic sound.&quot;<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> Dylan's touring band has two guitarists along with a multi-instrumentalist who plays steel guitar, mandolin, banjo and fiddle. From 2002 to 2005, Dylan's keyboard had a piano sound. In 2006, this was changed to an organ sound. At the start of his Spring 2007 tour in Europe, Dylan played the first half of the set on electric guitar and switched to keyboard for the second half.<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a> At the beginning of 2008, Dylan's official website announced that the next leg of his &quot;<a href="Never_Ending_Tour" title="wikilink">Never Ending Tour</a>&quot; will consist of concert dates in Dallas, Texas, followed by a tour of Mexico and South America in February and March.<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a></p>

<p>Bob Dylan's large and vocal fan base writes books, essays, '<a href="zine" title="wikilink">zines</a>, etc. at a furious rate. They also maintain a massive Internet presence with daily Dylan news: a site which documents every song he has ever played in concert; one that documents bootlegs that have been released; and one where visitors bet on what songs he will play on upcoming tours;&lt;ref name &quot;Unpredictability&quot;&gt;</ref> along with hundreds of other Dylan-themed sites. Within minutes of the end of concerts, set lists and reviews are posted by his loyal following.<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a></p>
<p>The Dylan Pool, created in 2001 has been featured on CNN, CBC, BBC, and the Associated Press. The Associated Press reported: &quot;The pool reflects both the obsessive interest Dylan still draws 45 years into his career and the way this road warrior has structured his career.&quot;&lt;ref name &quot;Unpredictability&quot; /&gt; It allows interaction between fans while adding a level of competition through the unique online Bob Dylan fantasy game. In the summer of 2007 the Dylan Pool went offline but some fans, having anticipated this eventuality, launched a new website: <a href="http://www.theneverendingpool.com">The neverending pool</a>.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.bobdylanisis.com">ISIS Magazine</a></em> was founded in 1985 and is the longest running publication about Bob Dylan. Edited since its inception by Derek Barker, the magazine, which is published bimonthly, has subscribers in 32 countries.</p>
<h2 id="chronicles-volume-one"><em>Chronicles: Volume One</em></h2>
<p>After a lengthy delay, October 2004 saw the publishing of Dylan's autobiography <em><a href="Chronicles:_Vol._One" title="wikilink">Chronicles: Volume One</a></em>, with which he once again confounded expectations.<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a> Dylan wrote three chapters about the year between his arrival in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> in 1961 and recording his first album. Dylan focused on the brief period before he was a household name, while virtually ignoring the mid-1960s when his fame was at its height. Details about his motorcycle accident are limited to a few words in a single sentence. He also devoted chapters to two lesser-known albums, <em><a href="New_Morning" title="wikilink">New Morning</a></em> (1970) and <em><a href="Oh_Mercy" title="wikilink">Oh Mercy</a></em> (1989), which contained insights into his collaborations with poet <a href="Archibald_MacLeish" title="wikilink">Archibald MacLeish</a> and producer <a href="Daniel_Lanois" title="wikilink">Daniel Lanois</a>. In the <em><a href="New_Morning" title="wikilink">New Morning</a></em> chapter, Dylan expresses distaste for the &quot;spokesman of a generation&quot; label bestowed upon him, and evinces disgust with his more fanatical followers.</p>
<p>Another section features Dylan's account of a guitar-playing style in mathematical detail that he claimed was the key to his renaissance in the 1990s.<a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> Despite the <a href="Opaque_context" title="wikilink">opacity</a> of some passages, there is an overall clarity in voice that is generally missing in Dylan's other prose writings,<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> and a noticeable generosity towards friends and lovers of his early years.<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a> At the end of the book, Dylan describes with great passion the moment when he listened to the <a href="Bertolt_Brecht" title="wikilink">Brecht</a>/<a href="Kurt_Weill" title="wikilink">Weill</a> song &quot;<a href="The_Threepenny_Opera" title="wikilink">Pirate Jenny</a>&quot;, and the moment when he first heard <a href="Robert_Johnson_(musician)" title="wikilink">Robert Johnson</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s recordings. In these passages, Dylan suggested the process which ignited his own song writing.</p>
<p><em>Chronicles: Volume One</em> reached number two on <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em>' Hardcover Non-Fiction best seller list in December 2004 and was nominated for a <a href="National_Book_Award" title="wikilink">National Book Award</a>. Simultaneously, <a href="Amazon.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amazon.com</a> and <a href="Barnes_&amp;_Noble" title="wikilink">Barnes &amp; Noble</a> reported the book as their number two best-seller among all categories.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> <em>Chronicles: Volume One</em> is the first of three planned volumes.</p>
