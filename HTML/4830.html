<p><strong>Radioactive waste</strong> is a <a href="waste" class="uri" title="wikilink">waste</a> product containing <a href="radioactive_decay" title="wikilink">radioactive</a> material. It is usually the product of a nuclear process such as <a href="nuclear_fission" title="wikilink">nuclear fission</a>, though industries not directly connected to the <a href="nuclear_power" title="wikilink">nuclear power industry</a> may also produce radioactive waste.</p>
<p>Radioactivity diminishes over time, so in principle the waste needs to be isolated for a period of time until it no longer poses a hazard. This can mean hours to years for some common medical or industrial radioactive wastes, or thousands of years for <a href="high-level_radioactive_waste" title="wikilink">high-level wastes</a> from nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons reprocessing.</p>
<p>The majority of radioactive waste is &quot;<a href="low-level_waste" title="wikilink">low-level waste</a>&quot;, meaning it has low levels of radioactivity per <a href="mass" class="uri" title="wikilink">mass</a> or <a href="volume" class="uri" title="wikilink">volume</a>.</p>
<p>The main approaches to managing radioactive waste to date have been segregation and storage for short-lived wastes, near-surface disposal for low and some intermediate level wastes, and deep burial or transmutation for the long-lived, high-level wastes.</p>
<p>A summary of the amounts of radioactive wastes and management approaches for most developed countries are presented and reviewed periodically as part of the <a href="IAEA" class="uri" title="wikilink">IAEA</a> Joint Convention on Safety of Spent Fuel Management and the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-nature-and-significance-of-radioactive-waste">The nature and significance of radioactive waste</h2>
<p>Radioactive waste typically comprises a number of <a href="radioisotopes" class="uri" title="wikilink">radioisotopes</a>: unstable configurations of elements that <a href="radioactive_decay" title="wikilink">decay</a>, emitting <a href="ionizing_radiation" title="wikilink">ionizing radiation</a> which can be harmful to humans and the environment. Those isotopes emit different types and levels of radiation, which last for different periods of time.</p>
<h3 id="physics">Physics</h3>


<p>The radioactivity of all nuclear waste diminishes with time. All radioisotopes contained in the waste have a <a href="half-life" class="uri" title="wikilink">half-life</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;the time it takes for any radionuclide to lose half of its radioactivity&lt;U+2014&gt;and eventually all radioactive waste decays into non-radioactive elements. Certain radioactive elements (such as <a href="plutonium-239" class="uri" title="wikilink">plutonium-239</a>) in &lt;U+201C&gt;spent&lt;U+201D&gt; fuel will remain hazardous to humans and other creatures for hundreds of thousands of years. Other radioisotopes remain hazardous for millions of years. Thus, these wastes must be shielded for centuries and isolated from the living environment for millennia.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Some elements, such as <a href="iodine-131" class="uri" title="wikilink">iodine-131</a>, have a short half-life (around 8 days in this case) and thus they will cease to be a problem much more quickly than other, longer-lived, decay products, but their activity is much greater initially. The two tables show some of the major radioisotopes, their half-lives, and their <a href="fission_product_yield" title="wikilink">radiation yield</a> as a proportion of the yield of fission of uranium-235.</p>
<p>The faster a <a href="radioisotope" class="uri" title="wikilink">radioisotope</a> decays, the more radioactive it will be. The energy and the type of the <a href="ionizing_radiation" title="wikilink">ionizing radiation</a> emitted by a pure radioactive substance are important factors in deciding how dangerous it is. The chemical properties of the radioactive <a href="chemical_element" title="wikilink">element</a> will determine how mobile the substance is and how likely it is to spread into the environment and contaminate humans. This is further complicated by the fact that many radioisotopes do not decay immediately to a stable state but rather to a radioactive <a href="decay_product" title="wikilink">decay product</a> leading to <a href="decay_chain" title="wikilink">decay chains</a>.</p>
<h3 id="pharmacokinetics">Pharmacokinetics</h3>

<p>Exposure to high levels of radioactive waste may cause serious harm or <a href="death" class="uri" title="wikilink">death</a>. Treatment of an <a href="adult" class="uri" title="wikilink">adult</a> animal with <a href="radiation" class="uri" title="wikilink">radiation</a> or some other <a href="mutation" class="uri" title="wikilink">mutation</a>-causing effect, such as a cytotoxic anti-<a href="cancer" class="uri" title="wikilink">cancer</a> <a href="drug" class="uri" title="wikilink">drug</a>, may cause cancer in the animal. In humans it has been calculated that a 5 <a href="sievert" class="uri" title="wikilink">sievert</a> dose is usually fatal, and the lifetime risk of dying from radiation induced cancer from a single dose of 0.1 sieverts is 0.8%, increasing by the same amount for each additional 0.1 sievert increment of dosage.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Ionizing radiation causes deletions in chromosomes.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> If a developing organism such as an <a href="unborn_child" title="wikilink">unborn child</a> is irradiated, it is possible a <a href="birth_defect" title="wikilink">birth defect</a> may be induced, but it is unlikely this defect will be in a <a href="gamete" class="uri" title="wikilink">gamete</a> or a gamete forming <a href="cell_(biology)" title="wikilink">cell</a>. The incidence of radiation-induced mutations in humans is undetermined, due to flaws in studies done to date.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Depending on the decay mode and the <a href="pharmacokinetics" class="uri" title="wikilink">pharmacokinetics</a> of an element (how the body processes it and how quickly), the threat due to exposure to a given activity of a <a href="radioisotope" class="uri" title="wikilink">radioisotope</a> will differ. For instance <a href="iodine-131" class="uri" title="wikilink">iodine-131</a> is a short-lived <a href="beta_decay" title="wikilink">beta</a> and <a href="gamma_decay" title="wikilink">gamma</a> emitter, but because it concentrates in the <a href="thyroid" class="uri" title="wikilink">thyroid</a> gland, it is more able to cause injury than <a href="caesium" class="uri" title="wikilink">caesium</a>-137 which, being water soluble, is rapidly excreted in urine. In a similar way, the <a href="alpha_decay" title="wikilink">alpha</a> emitting actinides and <a href="radium" class="uri" title="wikilink">radium</a> are considered very harmful as they tend to have long <a href="Biological_half-life" title="wikilink">biological half-lives</a> and their radiation has a high linear energy transfer value. Because of such differences, the rules determining biological injury differ widely according to the radioisotope, and sometimes also the nature of the chemical compound which contains the radioisotope.</p>
<h2 id="sources-of-waste">Sources of waste</h2>
<p>Radioactive waste comes from a number of sources. The majority of waste originates from the nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear weapons reprocessing. However, other sources include medical and industrial wastes, as well as naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) that can be concentrated as a result of the processing or consumption of coal, oil and gas, and some minerals, as discussed below.</p>
<h3 id="nuclear-fuel-cycle">Nuclear fuel cycle</h3>

<dd><em>This article is about radioactive waste, for contextual information, see <a href="Nuclear_power" title="wikilink">Nuclear power</a>.</em>

</dl>
<h4 id="front-end">Front end</h4>
<p>Waste from the front end of the <a href="nuclear_fuel_cycle" title="wikilink">nuclear fuel cycle</a> is usually alpha emitting waste from the extraction of uranium. It often contains radium and its decay products.</p>
<p><a href="Uranium_dioxide" title="wikilink">Uranium dioxide</a> (UO<sub>2</sub>) concentrate from mining is not very radioactive - only a thousand or so times as radioactive as the <a href="granite" class="uri" title="wikilink">granite</a> used in buildings. It is refined from <a href="yellowcake" class="uri" title="wikilink">yellowcake</a> (U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>), then converted to <a href="uranium_hexafluoride" title="wikilink">uranium hexafluoride</a> gas (UF<sub>6</sub>). As a gas, it undergoes <a href="enriched_uranium" title="wikilink">enrichment</a> to increase the <a href="Uranium-235" title="wikilink">U-235</a> content from 0.7% to about 4.4% (LEU). It is then turned into a hard <a href="ceramic" class="uri" title="wikilink">ceramic</a> oxide (UO<sub>2</sub>) for assembly as reactor fuel elements.</p>
<p>The main by-product of enrichment is <a href="depleted_uranium" title="wikilink">depleted uranium</a> (DU), principally the <a href="U-238" class="uri" title="wikilink">U-238</a> isotope, with a U-235 content of ~0.3%. It is stored, either as UF<sub>6</sub> or as U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. Some is used in applications where its extremely high density makes it valuable, such as the keels of <a href="yachts" class="uri" title="wikilink">yachts</a>, and <a href="anti-tank" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-tank</a> <a href="KE-penetrator" title="wikilink">shells</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> It is also used with plutonium for making <a href="mixed_oxide_fuel" title="wikilink">mixed oxide fuel</a> (MOX) and to dilute, or <a href="enriched_uranium#Downblending" title="wikilink">downblend</a>, highly enriched uranium from weapons stockpiles which is now being redirected to become reactor fuel.</p>
<h4 id="back-end">Back end</h4>

<p>The back end of the nuclear fuel cycle, mostly spent <a href="fuel_rod" title="wikilink">fuel rods</a>, contains <a href="fission_product" title="wikilink">fission products</a> that emit beta and gamma radiation, and <a href="actinide" title="wikilink">actinides</a> that emit <a href="alpha_particle" title="wikilink">alpha particles</a>, such as <a href="uranium-234" class="uri" title="wikilink">uranium-234</a>, <a href="neptunium-237" class="uri" title="wikilink">neptunium-237</a>, <a href="plutonium-238" class="uri" title="wikilink">plutonium-238</a> and <a href="americium-241" class="uri" title="wikilink">americium-241</a>, and even sometimes some neutron emitters such as <a href="californium" class="uri" title="wikilink">californium</a> (Cf). These isotopes are formed in <a href="nuclear_reactor" title="wikilink">nuclear reactors</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish the processing of uranium to make fuel from the <a href="nuclear_reprocessing" title="wikilink">reprocessing</a> of used fuel. Used fuel contains the highly radioactive products of fission (see high level waste below). Many of these are neutron absorbers, called <a href="neutron_poison" title="wikilink">neutron poisons</a> in this context. These eventually build up to a level where they absorb so many neutrons that the chain reaction stops, even with the control rods completely removed. At that point the fuel has to be replaced in the reactor with fresh fuel, even though there is still a substantial quantity of <a href="uranium-235" class="uri" title="wikilink">uranium-235</a> and <a href="plutonium" class="uri" title="wikilink">plutonium</a> present. In the United States, this used fuel is stored, while in countries such as Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Japan and India, the fuel is reprocessed to remove the fission products, and the fuel can then be re-used. This reprocessing involves handling highly radioactive materials, and the fission products removed from the fuel are a concentrated form of high-level waste as are the chemicals used in the process. While these countries reprocess the fuel carrying out single plutonium cycles, India is the only country known to be planning multiple plutonium recycling schemes.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="fuel-composition-and-long-term-radioactivity">Fuel composition and long term radioactivity</h4>

<p><img src="activityuranium233.jpg" title="fig:Activity of U-233 for three fuel types" alt="Activity of U-233 for three fuel types" /> <img src="activitytotal.jpg" title="fig:Total activity for three fuel types" alt="Total activity for three fuel types" /></p>
<p>Long-lived radioactive waste from the back end of the fuel cycle is especially relevant when designing a complete waste management plan for <a href="spent_nuclear_fuel" title="wikilink">spent nuclear fuel</a> (SNF). When looking at long term radioactive decay, the actinides in the SNF have a significant influence due to their characteristically long half-lives. Depending on what a <a href="nuclear_reactor_technology" title="wikilink">nuclear reactor</a> is fueled with, the actinide composition in the SNF will be different.</p>
<p>An example of this effect is the use of <a href="nuclear_fuel" title="wikilink">nuclear fuels</a> with <a href="thorium" class="uri" title="wikilink">thorium</a>. Th-232 is a fertile material that can undergo a neutron capture reaction and two beta minus decays, resulting in the production of fissile <a href="uranium-233" title="wikilink">U-233</a>. The SNF of a cycle with thorium will contain U-233, an isotope with a <a href="half-life" class="uri" title="wikilink">half-life</a> of 159,000 years. Its radioactive decay will strongly influence the long-term <a href="radioactive_decay" title="wikilink">activity</a> curve of the SNF around 1 million years. A comparison of the activity associated to U-233 for three different SNF types can be seen in the figure on the top right.</p>
<p>The burnt fuels are thorium with reactor-grade plutonium (RGPu), thorium with weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu) and <a href="MOX_fuel" title="wikilink">Mixed Oxide fuel</a> (MOX). For RGPu and WGPu, the initial amount of U-233 and its decay around 1 million years can be seen. This has an effect in the total activity curve of the three fuel types. The absence of U-233 and its daughter products in the MOX fuel results in a lower activity in region 3 of the figure on the bottom right, whereas for RGPu and WGPu the curve is maintained higher due to the presence of U-233 that has not fully decayed.</p>
<p>The use of different fuels in nuclear reactors results in different SNF composition, with varying activity curves.</p>
<h4 id="proliferation-concerns">Proliferation concerns</h4>

<p>Since uranium and plutonium are <a href="nuclear_weapons" title="wikilink">nuclear weapons</a> materials, there have been proliferations concerns. Ordinarily (in <a href="spent_nuclear_fuel" title="wikilink">spent nuclear fuel</a>), plutonium is <a href="reactor-grade_plutonium" title="wikilink">reactor-grade plutonium</a>. In addition to <a href="plutonium-239" class="uri" title="wikilink">plutonium-239</a>, which is highly suitable for building nuclear weapons, it contains large amounts of undesirable contaminants: <a href="plutonium-240" class="uri" title="wikilink">plutonium-240</a>, <a href="plutonium-241" class="uri" title="wikilink">plutonium-241</a>, and <a href="plutonium-238" class="uri" title="wikilink">plutonium-238</a>. These isotopes are difficult to separate, and more cost-effective ways of obtaining fissile material exist (e.g. uranium enrichment or dedicated plutonium production reactors).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>High-level waste is full of highly radioactive <a href="fission_products" title="wikilink">fission products</a>, most of which are relatively short-lived. This is a concern since if the waste is stored, perhaps in <a href="deep_geological_repository" title="wikilink">deep geological storage</a>, over many years the fission products decay, decreasing the radioactivity of the waste and making the plutonium easier to access. The undesirable contaminant Pu-240 decays faster than the Pu-239, and thus the quality of the bomb material increases with time (although its quantity decreases during that time as well). Thus, some have argued, as time passes, these deep storage areas have the potential to become &quot;plutonium mines&quot;, from which material for nuclear weapons can be acquired with relatively little difficulty. Critics of the latter idea point out that the half-life of Pu-240 is 6,560 years and Pu-239 is 24,110 years, and thus the relative enrichment of one isotope to the other with time occurs with a half-life of 9,000 years (that is, it takes 9000 years for the <em>fraction</em> of Pu-240 in a sample of mixed plutonium isotopes, to spontaneously decrease by half&lt;U+2014&gt;a typical enrichment needed to turn reactor-grade into weapons-grade Pu). Thus &quot;weapons grade plutonium mines&quot; would be a problem for the very far future (&gt;9,000 years from now), so that there remains a great deal of time for technology to advance to solve it.</p>
<p>Pu-239 decays to <a href="Uranium-235" title="wikilink">U-235</a> which is suitable for weapons and which has a very long half life (roughly 10<sup>9</sup> years). Thus plutonium may decay and leave uranium-235. However, modern reactors are only moderately enriched with U-235 relative to U-238, so the U-238 continues to serve as a <a href="Denaturation_(fissile_materials)" title="wikilink">denaturation</a> agent for any U-235 produced by plutonium decay.</p>
<p>One solution to this problem is to recycle the plutonium and use it as a fuel e.g. in <a href="fast_reactor" title="wikilink">fast reactors</a>. But in the minds of some, the very existence of the <a href="nuclear_fuel_reprocessing_plant" title="wikilink">nuclear fuel reprocessing plant</a> needed to separate the plutonium from the other elements represents a proliferation concern. In <a href="Integral_Fast_Reactor" title="wikilink">pyrometallurgical fast reactors</a>, the separated plutonium and uranium are contaminated by actinides and cannot be used for nuclear weapons.</p>
<h3 id="nuclear-weapons-decommissioning">Nuclear weapons decommissioning</h3>
<p>Waste from nuclear weapons <a href="decommissioning" class="uri" title="wikilink">decommissioning</a> is unlikely to contain much beta or gamma activity other than <a href="tritium" class="uri" title="wikilink">tritium</a> and <a href="americium" class="uri" title="wikilink">americium</a>. It is more likely to contain alpha-emitting actinides such as Pu-239 which is a fissile material used in bombs, plus some material with much higher specific activities, such as Pu-238 or Po.</p>
<p>In the past the neutron trigger for an <a href="nuclear_weapon" title="wikilink">atomic bomb</a> tended to be <a href="beryllium" class="uri" title="wikilink">beryllium</a> and a high activity alpha emitter such as <a href="polonium" class="uri" title="wikilink">polonium</a>; an alternative to polonium is <a href="Pu-238" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pu-238</a>. For reasons of national security, details of the design of modern bombs are normally not released to the open literature.</p>
<p>Some designs might contain a <a href="radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" title="wikilink">radioisotope thermoelectric generator</a> using Pu-238 to provide a long lasting source of electrical power for the electronics in the device.</p>
<p>It is likely that the fissile material of an old bomb which is due for refitting will contain decay products of the plutonium isotopes used in it, these are likely to include <a href="U-236" class="uri" title="wikilink">U-236</a> from Pu-240 impurities, plus some U-235 from decay of the Pu-239; due to the relatively long half-life of these Pu isotopes, these wastes from radioactive decay of bomb core material would be very small, and in any case, far less dangerous (even in terms of simple radioactivity) than the Pu-239 itself.</p>
<p>The beta decay of <a href="Pu-241" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pu-241</a> forms <a href="Am-241" class="uri" title="wikilink">Am-241</a>; the in-growth of americium is likely to be a greater problem than the decay of Pu-239 and Pu-240 as the americium is a gamma emitter (increasing external-exposure to workers) and is an alpha emitter which can cause the generation of <a href="heat" class="uri" title="wikilink">heat</a>. The plutonium could be separated from the americium by several different processes; these would include <a href="Nuclear_reprocessing#Non_aqueous_methods" title="wikilink">pyrochemical</a> processes and aqueous/organic <a href="solvent_extraction" title="wikilink">solvent extraction</a>. A truncated <a href="PUREX" class="uri" title="wikilink">PUREX</a> type extraction process would be one possible method of making the separation.</p>
<h3 id="legacy-waste">Legacy waste</h3>
<p>Due to historic activities typically related to radium industry, uranium mining, and military programs, there are numerous sites that contain or are contaminated with radioactivity. In the United States alone, the <a href="United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="wikilink">Department of Energy</a> states there are &quot;millions of gallons of radioactive waste&quot; as well as &quot;thousands of tons of <a href="spent_nuclear_fuel" title="wikilink">spent nuclear fuel</a> and material&quot; and also &quot;huge quantities of contaminated soil and water.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Despite copious quantities of waste, the DOE has stated a goal of cleaning all presently contaminated sites successfully by 2025.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The <a href="Fernald,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Fernald</a>, <a href="Ohio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ohio</a> site for example had &quot;31 million pounds of uranium product&quot;, &quot;2.5 billion pounds of waste&quot;, &quot;2.75 million cubic yards of contaminated soil and debris&quot;, and a &quot;223 acre portion of the underlying Great Miami Aquifer had uranium levels above drinking standards.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The United States has at least 108 sites designated as areas that are contaminated and unusable, sometimes many thousands of acres.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> DOE wishes to clean or mitigate many or all by 2025, however the task can be difficult and it acknowledges that some may never be completely remediated.

<p>Processing of substances containing &quot;natural&quot; radioactivity is often known as NORM.

The radon decays to form solid radioisotopes which form coatings on the inside of pipework. In an oil processing plant the area of the plant where <a href="propane" class="uri" title="wikilink">propane</a> is processed is often one of the more contaminated areas of the plant as radon has a similar boiling point to propane.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="types-of-radioactive-waste">Types of radioactive waste</h2>
<p><img src="Fort-greely-low-level-waste.jpg" title="fig:Removal of very low-level waste" alt="Removal of very low-level waste" /> Although not significantly radioactive, <em>uranium mill tailings</em> are waste. They are byproduct material from the rough processing of uranium-bearing ore. They are sometimes referred to as 11(e)2 wastes, from the section of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act that defines them. Uranium mill tailings typically also contain chemically hazardous heavy metals such as <a href="lead" class="uri" title="wikilink">lead</a> and <a href="arsenic" class="uri" title="wikilink">arsenic</a>. Vast mounds of uranium mill tailings are left at many old mining sites, especially in <a href="Colorado" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colorado</a>, <a href="New_Mexico" title="wikilink">New Mexico</a>, and <a href="Utah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Utah</a>.</p>
<p><em><a href="Low_level_waste" title="wikilink">Low level waste</a> (LLW)</em> is generated from hospitals and industry, as well as the nuclear fuel cycle. It comprises paper, rags, tools, clothing, filters, etc., which contain small amounts of mostly short-lived radioactivity. Commonly, LLW is designated as such as a precautionary measure if it originated from any region of an 'Active Area', which frequently includes offices with only a remote possibility of being contaminated with radioactive materials. Such LLW typically exhibits no higher radioactivity than one would expect from the same material disposed of in a non-active area, such as a normal office block. Some high activity LLW requires shielding during handling and transport but most LLW is suitable for shallow land burial. To reduce its volume, it is often compacted or incinerated before disposal. Low level waste is divided into four classes, class A, B, C and GTCC, which means &quot;Greater Than Class C&quot;.</p>
<p><em>Intermediate level waste (ILW)</em> contains higher amounts of radioactivity and in some cases requires shielding. ILW includes <a href="resin" title="wikilink">resins</a>, chemical <a href="sludge" class="uri" title="wikilink">sludge</a> and metal reactor <a href="nuclear_fuel" title="wikilink">fuel</a> cladding, as well as contaminated materials from reactor decommissioning. It may be solidified in concrete or bitumen for disposal. As a general rule, short-lived waste (mainly non-fuel materials from reactors) is buried in shallow repositories, while long-lived waste (from fuel and fuel-reprocessing) is deposited in <a href="geological_repository" title="wikilink">deep underground facilities</a>. U.S. regulations do not define this category of waste; the term is used in Europe and elsewhere.</p>

It is highly radioactive and often thermally hot. HLW accounts for over 95% of the total radioactivity produced in the process of nuclear <a href="electricity_generation" title="wikilink">electricity generation</a>. The amount of HLW worldwide is currently increasing by about 12,000 metric tons every year, which is the equivalent to about 100 double-decker buses or a two-story structure with a footprint the size of a basketball court.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> A 1000-MWe nuclear power plant produces about 27 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel (unreprocessed) every year.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p><em><a href="Transuranic_waste" title="wikilink">Transuranic waste</a> (TRUW)</em> as defined by U.S. regulations is, without regard to form or origin, waste that is contaminated with alpha-emitting <a href="transuranic" class="uri" title="wikilink">transuranic</a> radionuclides with half-lives greater than 20 years, and concentrations greater than 100 <a href="curie" title="wikilink">nCi</a>/g (3.7 <a href="becquerel" title="wikilink">MBq</a>/kg), excluding High Level Waste. Elements that have an <a href="atomic_number" title="wikilink">atomic number</a> greater than uranium are called transuranic (&quot;beyond uranium&quot;). Because of their long half-lives, TRUW is disposed more cautiously than either low level or intermediate level waste. In the US it arises mainly from weapons production, and consists of clothing, tools, rags, residues, debris and other items contaminated with small amounts of radioactive elements (mainly plutonium).</p>
<p>Under US law, transuranic waste is further categorized into &quot;contact-handled&quot; (CH) and &quot;remote-handled&quot; (RH) on the basis of radiation dose measured at the surface of the waste container. CH TRUW has a surface dose rate not greater than 200 <a href="R&lt;U+00F6&gt;ntgen_equivalent_man" title="wikilink">mrem</a> per hour (2 <a href="millisievert" title="wikilink">mSv</a>/h), whereas RH TRUW has a surface dose rate of 200 <a href="R&lt;U+00F6&gt;ntgen_equivalent_man" title="wikilink">mrem</a> per hour (2 mSv/h) or greater. CH TRUW does not have the very high radioactivity of high level waste, nor its high heat generation, but RH TRUW can be highly radioactive, with surface dose rates up to 1000000 <a href="R&lt;U+00F6&gt;ntgen_equivalent_man" title="wikilink">mrem</a> per hour (10000 mSv/h).

<p><img src="Nuclear_waste_container_2010_nevada.jpg" title="fig:Modern medium to high level transport container for nuclear waste." alt="Modern medium to high level transport container for nuclear waste." />  Of particular concern in nuclear waste management are two long-lived fission products, Tc-99 (half-life 220,000 years) and I-129 (half-life 17 million years), which dominate spent fuel radioactivity after a few thousand years. The most troublesome transuranic elements in spent fuel are Np-237 (half-life two million years) and Pu-239 (half life 24,000 years).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Nuclear waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from interacting with the <a href="biosphere" class="uri" title="wikilink">biosphere</a>.

<h4 id="vitrification">Vitrification</h4>
<p><img src="Vitrification1.jpg" title="fig:A vitrification experiment for the study of nuclear waste disposal" alt="A vitrification experiment for the study of nuclear waste disposal" /> Long-term storage of radioactive waste requires the stabilization of the waste into a form which will neither react nor degrade for extended periods of time. One way to do this is through <a href="Radioactive_waste#Vitrification" title="wikilink">vitrification</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Currently at <a href="Sellafield" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sellafield</a> the high-level waste (<a href="PUREX" class="uri" title="wikilink">PUREX</a> first cycle <a href="raffinate" class="uri" title="wikilink">raffinate</a>) is mixed with <a href="sugar" class="uri" title="wikilink">sugar</a> and then calcined. <a href="Calcination" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calcination</a> involves passing the waste through a heated, rotating tube. The purposes of calcination are to evaporate the water from the waste, and de-nitrate the fission products to assist the stability of the glass produced.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>The 'calcine' generated is fed continuously into an induction heated furnace with fragmented <a href="glass" class="uri" title="wikilink">glass</a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a>. The resulting glass is a new substance in which the waste products are bonded into the glass matrix when it solidifies. This product, as a melt, is poured into <a href="stainless_steel" title="wikilink">stainless steel</a> cylindrical containers (&quot;cylinders&quot;) in a batch process. When cooled, the fluid solidifies (&quot;vitrifies&quot;) into the glass. Such glass, after being formed, is highly resistant to water. <a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>After filling a cylinder, a seal is <a href="weld" title="wikilink">welded</a> onto the cylinder. The cylinder is then washed. After being inspected for external contamination, the steel cylinder is stored, usually in an underground repository. In this form, the waste products are expected to be immobilized for a long period of time (many thousands of years).<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>The glass inside a cylinder is usually a black glossy substance. All this work (in the United Kingdom) is done using <a href="hot_cell" title="wikilink">hot cell</a> systems. The sugar is added to control the <a href="ruthenium" class="uri" title="wikilink">ruthenium</a> chemistry and to stop the formation of the volatile <a href="ruthenium_tetroxide" title="wikilink">RuO<sub>4</sub></a> containing <a href="Ru-106" title="wikilink">radio ruthenium</a>. In the west, the glass is normally a <a href="borosilicate_glass" title="wikilink">borosilicate glass</a> (similar to <a href="Pyrex" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pyrex</a>), while in the former <a href="Soviet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Soviet</a> bloc it is normal to use a <a href="phosphate_glass" title="wikilink">phosphate glass</a>. The amount of fission products in the glass must be limited because some (<a href="palladium" class="uri" title="wikilink">palladium</a>, the other Pt group metals, and <a href="tellurium" class="uri" title="wikilink">tellurium</a>) tend to form metallic phases which separate from the glass. Bulk vitrification uses electrodes to melt soil and wastes, which are then buried underground.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In Germany a vitrification plant is in use; this is treating the waste from a small demonstration reprocessing plant which has since been closed down.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="ion-exchange">Ion exchange</h4>
<p>It is common for medium active wastes in the nuclear industry to be treated with <a href="ion_exchange" title="wikilink">ion exchange</a> or other means to concentrate the radioactivity into a small volume. The much less radioactive bulk (after treatment) is often then discharged. For instance, it is possible to use a <a href="ferric" class="uri" title="wikilink">ferric</a> <a href="hydroxide" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydroxide</a> <a href="floc" class="uri" title="wikilink">floc</a> to remove radioactive metals from aqueous mixtures <a href="http://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/w/waste-processing.htm">1</a>. After the radioisotopes are absorbed onto the ferric hydroxide, the resulting sludge can be placed in a metal drum before being mixed with cement to form a solid waste form. <a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> In order to get better long-term performance (mechanical stability) from such forms, they may be made from a mixture of <a href="fly_ash" title="wikilink">fly ash</a>, or <a href="blast_furnace" title="wikilink">blast furnace</a> <a href="slag" class="uri" title="wikilink">slag</a>, and <a href="Portland_cement" title="wikilink">Portland cement</a>, instead of normal <a href="concrete" class="uri" title="wikilink">concrete</a> (made with Portland cement, gravel and sand).</p>
<h4 id="synroc">Synroc</h4>
<p>The Australian <a href="Synroc" class="uri" title="wikilink">Synroc</a> (synthetic rock) is a more sophisticated way to immobilize such waste, and this process may eventually come into commercial use for civil wastes (it is currently being developed for US military wastes). Synroc was invented by the late Prof Ted Ringwood (a <a href="geochemist" class="uri" title="wikilink">geochemist</a>) at the <a href="Australian_National_University" title="wikilink">Australian National University</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The Synroc contains <a href="pyrochlore" class="uri" title="wikilink">pyrochlore</a> and cryptomelane type minerals.

<h3 id="long-term-management-of-waste">Long term management of waste</h3>

<p>The time frame in question when dealing with radioactive waste ranges from 10,000 to 1,000,000 years,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Researchers suggest that forecasts of health detriment for such periods should be examined critically.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> <a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Practical studies only consider up to 100 years as far as effective planning<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> and cost evaluations<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> are concerned. Long term behavior of radioactive wastes remains a subject for ongoing research projects.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="geologic-disposal">Geologic disposal</h4>
<p>The process of selecting appropriate <a href="Deep_geological_repository" title="wikilink">deep final repositories</a> for high level waste and spent fuel is now under way in several countries (<a href="Schacht_Asse_II" title="wikilink">Schacht Asse II</a> and the waste Isolation Pilot Plant) with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2010. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore <a href="tunnel_boring_machine" title="wikilink">tunnel boring machines</a> (similar to those used to drill the <a href="Channel_Tunnel" title="wikilink">Channel Tunnel</a> from England to France) to drill a shaft 500&lt;U+2013&gt;1,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. Many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate <a href="stewardship_cessation" title="wikilink">stewardship cessation</a> of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.</p>
<p>Because some radioactive species have half-lives longer than one million years, even very low container leakage and radionuclide migration rates must be taken into account.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Moreover, it may require more than one half-life until some nuclear materials lose enough radioactivity to cease being lethal to living things. A 1983 review of the Swedish radioactive waste disposal program by the National Academy of Sciences found that country&lt;U+2019&gt;s estimate of several hundred thousand years&lt;U+2014&gt;perhaps up to one million years&lt;U+2014&gt;being necessary for waste isolation &lt;U+201C&gt;fully justified.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Storing high level nuclear waste above ground for a century or so is considered appropriate by many scientists. This allows the material to be more easily observed and any problems detected and managed, while decay of radionuclides over this time period significantly reduces the level of radioactivity and associated harmful effects to the container material. It is also considered likely that over the next century newer materials will be developed which will not break down as quickly when exposed to a high neutron flux, thus increasing the longevity of the container once it is permanently buried.</p>
<p>Sea-based options for disposal of radioactive waste<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> include burial beneath a stable <a href="abyssal_plain" title="wikilink">abyssal plain</a>, burial in a <a href="subduction" class="uri" title="wikilink">subduction</a> zone that would slowly carry the waste downward into the <a href="mantle_(geology)" title="wikilink">Earth's mantle</a>, and burial beneath a remote natural or human-made island. While these approaches all have merit and would facilitate an international solution to the problem of disposal of radioactive waste, they would require an amendment of the <a href="United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea" title="wikilink">Law of the Sea</a>.</p>
<p>Article 1 (Definitions), 7., of the 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, (the London Dumping Convention) states:</p>
<dl>

<dd>&lt;U+201C&gt;Sea&lt;U+201D&gt; means all marine waters other than the internal waters of States, as well as the seabed and the subsoil thereof; it does not include sub-seabed repositories accessed only from land.&lt;U+201D&gt;
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The proposed land-based subductive waste disposal method disposes of nuclear waste in a <a href="subduction" class="uri" title="wikilink">subduction</a> zone accessed from land,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> and therefore is not prohibited by international agreement. This method has been described as the most viable means of disposing of radioactive waste,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> and as the state-of-the-art in nuclear waste disposal technology.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Another approach termed Remix &amp; Return<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> would blend high-level waste with <a href="uranium_mining" title="wikilink">uranium mine</a> and mill tailings down to the level of the original radioactivity of the <a href="uraninite" title="wikilink">uranium ore</a>, then replace it in inactive uranium mines. This approach has the merits of providing jobs for miners who would double as disposal staff, and of facilitating a cradle-to-grave cycle for radioactive materials, but would be inappropriate for spent reactor fuel in the absence of reprocessing, due to the presence in it of highly toxic radioactive elements such as plutonium.</p>
<p><a href="Deep_borehole_disposal" title="wikilink">Deep borehole disposal</a> is the concept of disposing of high-level radioactive waste from nuclear reactors in extremely deep boreholes. Deep borehole disposal seeks to place the waste as much as five kilometers beneath the surface of the Earth and relies primarily on the immense natural geological barrier to confine the waste safely and permanently so that it should never pose a threat to the environment.</p>
<h4 id="transmutation">Transmutation</h4>

<p>There have been proposals for reactors that consume nuclear waste and transmute it to other, less-harmful nuclear waste. In particular, the <a href="Integral_Fast_Reactor" title="wikilink">Integral Fast Reactor</a> was a proposed nuclear reactor with a nuclear fuel cycle that produced no transuranic waste and in fact, could consume transuranic waste. It proceeded as far as large-scale tests, but was then canceled by the US Government. Another approach, considered safer but requiring more development, is to dedicate <a href="subcritical_reactor" title="wikilink">subcritical reactors</a> to the <a href="Nuclear_transmutation" title="wikilink">transmutation</a> of the left-over transuranic elements.</p>
<p>An isotope that is found in nuclear waste and that represents a concern in terms of proliferation is Pu-239. The estimated world total of plutonium in the year 2000 was of 1,645 MT, of which 210 MT had been separated by reprocessing. The large stock of plutonium is a result of its production inside uranium-fueled reactors and of the reprocessing of weapons-grade plutonium during the weapons program. An option for getting rid of this plutonium is to use it as a fuel in a traditional Light Water Reactor (LWR). Several fuel types with differing plutonium destruction efficiencies are under study. See <a href="Nuclear_transmutation" title="wikilink">Nuclear transmutation</a>.</p>
<p>Transmutation was banned in the US in April 1977 by President Carter due to the danger of plutonium proliferation,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> but President Reagan rescinded the ban in 1981.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Due to the economic losses and risks, construction of reprocessing plants during this time did not resume. Due to high energy demand, work on the method has continued in the <a href="EU" class="uri" title="wikilink">EU</a>. This has resulted in a practical nuclear research reactor called Myrrha in which transmutation is possible. Additionally, a new research program called ACTINET has been started in the <a href="EU" class="uri" title="wikilink">EU</a> to make transmutation possible on a large, industrial scale. According to President Bush's Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) of 2007, the US is now actively promoting research on transmutation technologies needed to markedly reduce the problem of nuclear waste treatment.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>There have also been theoretical studies involving the use of <a href="fusion_reactor" title="wikilink">fusion reactors</a> as so called &quot;actinide burners&quot; where a fusion reactor <a href="plasma_(physics)" title="wikilink">plasma</a> such as in a <a href="tokamak" class="uri" title="wikilink">tokamak</a>, could be &quot;doped&quot; with a small amount of the &quot;minor&quot; transuranic atoms which would be transmuted (meaning fissioned in the actinide case) to lighter elements upon their successive bombardment by the very high energy neutrons produced by the fusion of <a href="deuterium" class="uri" title="wikilink">deuterium</a> and <a href="tritium" class="uri" title="wikilink">tritium</a> in the reactor. A study at <a href="MIT" class="uri" title="wikilink">MIT</a> found that only 2 or 3 fusion reactors with parameters similar to that of the <a href="International_Thermonuclear_Experimental_Reactor" title="wikilink">International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor</a> (ITER) could transmute the entire annual <a href="minor_actinide" title="wikilink">minor actinide</a> production from all of the <a href="light_water_reactor" title="wikilink">light water reactors</a> presently operating in the <a href="List_of_nuclear_reactors#Power_station_reactors_18" title="wikilink">United States fleet</a> while simultaneously generating approximately 1 <a href="gigawatt" class="uri" title="wikilink">gigawatt</a> of power from each reactor.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="re-use-of-waste">Re-use of waste</h4>

<p>Another option is to find applications for the isotopes in nuclear waste so as to <a href="re-use" class="uri" title="wikilink">re-use</a> them.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Already, <a href="caesium-137" class="uri" title="wikilink">caesium-137</a>, <a href="strontium-90" class="uri" title="wikilink">strontium-90</a> and a few other isotopes are extracted for certain industrial applications such as <a href="food_irradiation" title="wikilink">food irradiation</a> and <a href="radioisotope_thermoelectric_generators" title="wikilink">radioisotope thermoelectric generators</a>. While re-use does not eliminate the need to manage radioisotopes, it reduces the quantity of waste produced.</p>
<p>The Nuclear Assisted Hydrocarbon Production Method,<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Canadian patent application 2,659,302, is a method for the temporary or permanent storage of nuclear waste materials comprising the placing of waste materials into one or more repositories or boreholes constructed into an <a href="unconventional_oil" title="wikilink">unconventional oil</a> formation. The thermal flux of the waste materials fracture the formation, alters the chemical and/or physical properties of hydrocarbon material within the subterranean formation to allow removal of the altered material. A mixture of hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and/or other formation fluids are produced from the formation. The radioactivity of high-level radioactive waste affords proliferation resistance to plutonium placed in the periphery of the repository or the deepest portion of a borehole.</p>
<p>A 1990 proposed type of breeder reactor called a <a href="traveling_wave_reactor" title="wikilink">traveling wave reactor</a> is claimed, if it were to be built, to be able to be fueled by depleted uranium, which is currently considered nuclear waste.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="space-disposal">Space disposal</h4>
<p>Space disposal is an attractive notion because it permanently removes nuclear waste from the environment. It has significant disadvantages, not least of which is the potential for catastrophic failure of a <a href="launch_vehicle" title="wikilink">launch vehicle</a>. The high number of launches that would be required &lt;U+2014&gt; due to the fact that no individual rocket would be able to carry very much of the material relative to the material needed to be disposed of&lt;U+2014&gt;makes the proposal impractical (for both economic and risk-based reasons). To further complicate matters, international agreements on the regulation of such a program would need to be established.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>In the future, alternative, <a href="non-rocket_spacelaunch" title="wikilink">non-rocket spacelaunch</a> technologies may provide a solution. It has been suggested that through the use of a stationary launch system many of the risks of catastrophic launch failure could be avoided. A promising concept is the use of high power lasers to launch &quot;indestructible&quot; containers from the ground into space. Such a system would require no rocket propellant, with the launch vehicle's payload making up a near entirety of the vehicle's mass. Without the use of rocket fuel on board there would be little chance of the vehicle exploding.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>One possibility involves encasing the waste in vitrified form inside a steel shell  thick, which in turn is tiled with shuttle tile to its exterior. If the launch vehicle failed just before reaching orbit, the waste ball would safely re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. The steel shell would deform on impact, but would not rupture due to the density of the shell.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="national-management-plans">National management plans</h3>

<p>Most countries are considerably ahead of the United States in developing plans for high-level radioactive waste disposal. Sweden and Finland are furthest along in committing to a particular disposal technology, while many others reprocess spent fuel or contract with France or Great Britain to do it, taking back the resulting plutonium and high-level waste. &lt;U+201C&gt;An increasing backlog of plutonium from reprocessing is developing in many countries... It is doubtful that reprocessing makes economic sense in the present environment of cheap uranium.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>In many European countries (e.g., Britain, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland) the risk or dose limit for a member of the public exposed to radiation from a future high-level nuclear waste facility is considerably more stringent than that suggested by the International Commission on Radiation Protection or proposed in the United States. European limits are often more stringent than the standard suggested in 1990 by the International Commission on Radiation Protection by a factor of 20, and more stringent by a factor of ten than the standard proposed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for <a href="Yucca_Mountain_nuclear_waste_repository" title="wikilink">Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository</a> for the first 10,000 years after closure. Moreover, the U.S. EPA&lt;U+2019&gt;s proposed standard for greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more permissive than the European limit.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="illegal-dumping">Illegal dumping</h3>

<p>Authorities in Italy are investigating a <a href="&#39;Ndrangheta" class="uri" title="wikilink">'Ndrangheta</a> mafia clan accused of trafficking and illegally dumping nuclear waste. According to a <a href="turncoat" class="uri" title="wikilink">turncoat</a>, a manager of the Italy&lt;U+2019&gt;s state energy research agency <a href="Enea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Enea</a> paid the clan to get rid of 600 drums of toxic and radioactive waste from Italy, Switzerland, France, Germany, and the US, with <a href="Somalia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somalia</a> as the destination, where the waste was buried after buying off local politicians. Former employees of Enea are suspected of paying the criminals to take waste off their hands in the 1980s and 1990s. Shipments to Somalia continued into the 1990s, while the 'Ndrangheta clan also blew up shiploads of waste, including radioactive hospital waste, and sending them to the sea bed off the <a href="Calabria" title="wikilink">Calabrian coast</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> According to the environmental group <a href="Legambiente" class="uri" title="wikilink">Legambiente</a>, former members of the 'Ndrangheta have said that they were paid to sink ships with radioactive material for the last 20 years.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="accidents-involving-radioactive-waste">Accidents involving radioactive waste</h2>

<p>A number of incidents have occurred when radioactive material was disposed of improperly, shielding during transport was defective, or when it was simply abandoned or even stolen from a waste store.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> In the Soviet Union, waste stored in <a href="Lake_Karachay" title="wikilink">Lake Karachay</a> was blown over the area during a <a href="dust_storm" title="wikilink">dust storm</a> after the lake had partly dried out.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> At <a href="Maxey_Flat" title="wikilink">Maxey Flat</a>, a low-level radioactive waste facility located in <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a>, containment trenches covered with dirt, instead of steel or cement, collapsed under heavy rainfall into the trenches and filled with water. The water that invaded the trenches became radioactive and had to be disposed of at the <a href="Maxey_Flat" title="wikilink">Maxey Flat</a> facility itself. In other cases of radioactive waste accidents, lakes or ponds with radioactive waste accidentally overflowed into the rivers during exceptional storms. In Italy, several radioactive waste deposits let material flow into river water, thus contaminating water for domestic use.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> In France, in the summer of 2008 numerous incidents happened;<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> in one, at the Areva plant in <a href="Tricastin_Nuclear_Power_Center" title="wikilink">Tricastin</a>, it was reported that during a draining operation, liquid containing untreated uranium overflowed out of a faulty tank and about 75 kg of the radioactive material seeped into the ground and, from there, into two rivers nearby;<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> in another case, over 100 staff were contaminated with low doses of radiation.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>Scavenging of abandoned radioactive material has been the cause of several other cases of <a href="radiation_exposure" title="wikilink">radiation exposure</a>, mostly in <a href="developing_nation" title="wikilink">developing nations</a>, which may have less regulation of dangerous substances (and sometimes less general education about radioactivity and its hazards) and a market for scavenged goods and scrap metal. The scavengers and those who buy the material are almost always unaware that the material is radioactive and it is selected for its <a href="aesthetics" class="uri" title="wikilink">aesthetics</a> or scrap value.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Irresponsibility on the part of the radioactive material's owners, usually a hospital, university or military, and the absence of regulation concerning radioactive waste, or a lack of enforcement of such regulations, have been significant factors in radiation exposures. For an example of an accident involving radioactive scrap originating from a hospital see the <a href="Goi&lt;U+00E2&gt;nia_accident" title="wikilink">Goi&lt;U+00E2&gt;nia accident</a>.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>Transportation accidents involving spent nuclear fuel from power plants are unlikely to have serious consequences due to the strength of the <a href="spent_nuclear_fuel_shipping_cask" title="wikilink">spent nuclear fuel shipping casks</a>.</p>
