<p><strong>Choe Bu</strong> (1454&lt;U+2013&gt;1504) was a <a href="Korea" title="wikilink">Korean</a> official during the early <a href="Joseon_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Joseon Dynasty</a> (1392&lt;U+2013&gt;1910). He is best known for the account of his shipwrecked travels in <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a> from February to July 1488, during the <a href="Ming_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Ming Dynasty</a> (1368&lt;U+2013&gt;1644). Although he was eventually banished from the Joseon court in 1498 and then ultimately executed in 1504 during two political purges, he was given posthumous honors by the Joseon court in 1506.</p>
<p>Choe's diary accounts of his travels in China became widely printed in the 16th century in both Korea and <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>. Modern historians also utilize his written works, since his travel diary provides a unique outsider's perspective on Chinese culture in the 15th century and valuable information on China's cities and regional differences. The attitudes and opinions expressed in his writing represent in part the standpoints and views of the 15th-century <a href="Confucianism" title="wikilink">Confucian</a> Korean <a href="Intellectual" title="wikilink">literati</a>, who viewed <a href="Culture_of_China" title="wikilink">Chinese culture</a> as compatible with and <a href="Culture_of_Korea" title="wikilink">similar to their own</a>. His description of cities, people, customs, cuisines, and maritime commerce along <a href="Grand_Canal_(China)" title="wikilink">China's Grand Canal</a> provide insight into the daily life of China and how it differed between <a href="northern_and_southern_China" title="wikilink">northern and southern China</a> during the 15th century.</p>

<p>While serving his post in Jeju as the Commissioner of Registers for the island, a family slave from Naju arrived on February 12, 1488 to alert Choe that his father had died.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In keeping with his Confucian values, Choe prepared to leave his post immediately and begin the period of mourning for the loss of his father.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> However, while setting sail for <a href="Korean_Peninsula" title="wikilink">mainland Korea</a> with a crew of 43 Koreans,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Choe's ship was blown far off course during a violent storm that lasted 14 days, his ship aimlessly drifting off towards China until reaching the Chinese coast off of <a href="Taizhou,_Zhejiang" title="wikilink">Taizhou, Zhejiang</a>, near <a href="Ningbo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ningbo</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Before reaching the shores of <a href="Zhejiang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zhejiang</a>, Choe wrote on the fifth day of his travel at sea during the storm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This day a dense fog obscured everything. Things a foot away could not be made out. Towards evening, rain streamed down heavily, abating somewhat with night. The frightening waves were like mountains. They would lift the ship up into the blue sky and then drop it as if down an abyss. They billowed and crashed, the noise splitting heaven from earth. We might all be drowned and left to rot at any moment.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon the urging of his crewmen, Choe changed his clothes in a ritual fashion in preparation for death, although he <a href="Korean_mythology" title="wikilink">prayed to the heavens</a> to spare him and his crew, asking what sins they had committed to deserve this fate.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> On the sixth day, during fairer weather, their ship came upon a group of islands in the <a href="Yellow_Sea" title="wikilink">Yellow Sea</a> where Chinese pirates were moored.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The pirates robbed their ship of spare goods and rations, threw away the Koreans' oars and anchor, and left them to drift aimlessly into the sea.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Although it was still raining heavily, Choe's crew spotted a near-deserted strip of Zhejiang coastline on February 28.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Almost immediately his ship was surrounded by six Chinese boats, the crews of which did not attempt to board Choe's ship until the following day.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Although he could not speak Chinese, Choe was able to communicate with the Chinese by using their <a href="Written_Chinese" title="wikilink">written character system</a> in what was dubbed &quot;brush conversations&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Through writing, he questioned these Chinese sailors on how far the nearest official road and <a href="courier" class="uri" title="wikilink">courier</a> route was.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> When given three different estimates of the distance from there to the <a href="Taizhou,_Zhejiang" title="wikilink">Taizhou</a> prefectural capital, Choe was convinced that his hosts were deceiving him; historian Timothy Brook notes that it was more likely ignorance and inexperience of traveling inland than mere deception on behalf of the Chinese sailors.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Regardless, the Chinese sailors began robbing the Korean ship of its remaining goods, convinced that they were <a href="Wokou" title="wikilink">Japanese pirates</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> When heavy rains inundated the region once more, the Chinese sailors returned to their ships; Choe's party, fearing for their lives should the sailors board their ship again, saw this as an opportune moment and made a dash for the shore under cover of rain.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> After traveling several days overland looking for the nearest courier route, Choe's party was found by Chinese authorities and taken to Taizhou Battalion.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Like in the previous incident with the Chinese sailors and villagers along the shore, the Koreans were almost killed when they were first encountered by Chinese soldiers.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Employing his wit and intellect in these dangerous confrontations of being misconstrued as a coastal pirate, Choe avoided disaster for him and his crew.</p>
<p>The <a href="battalion" class="uri" title="wikilink">battalion</a> commander at Taizhou ordered his officer Zhai Yong to escort Choe Bu's Korean party to the regional command center at <a href="Shaoxing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shaoxing</a> on March 6.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> From there they could be transferred to provincial authorities at <a href="Hangzhou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hangzhou</a> and finally to the empire's capital of <a href="Beijing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beijing</a> where the party could be officially escorted back to Korea.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Choe Bu and his officers were carried in <a href="litter_(vehicle)" title="wikilink">sedan chairs</a>, an accommodation provided by the Taizhou Battalion, although in spots of rough terrain Choe Bu and his officers were forced to walk on foot like the others.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>The battalion troops escorting Choe and his Korean party reached Jiantiao Battalion on March 8; on the next day, they traveled by boat across Sanmen Bay to reach the Yuexi Police Station and Post House.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> On March 10, the party traveled along the postal route to Baiqiao Station, a courier center between Taizhou and Ningbo prefectures.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The courier officials were eager to see the Koreans off; even a party of 43 was a somewhat large group for a courier station to provide sudden accommodations for.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>In a daylong trip, the party reached the next station located 35 km (22 miles) north by the second watch of the night.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Heavy rains and wind made further advance impossible, but despite rain on the next day, Zhai Yong urged Choe and the Koreans to push on regardless, explaining that the regulations for prompt arrival times in China's courier system were very stringent.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The party covered another 35 km (22 miles) on March 11, completely soaked by the rain when they reached the next station.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The station master provided the party with a small fire to keep warm, but a man who thought the Koreans were captured pirates barged in and kicked their fire out in a rage.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Zhai Yong dutifully wrote an account of this assault and passed it on to the county magistrate's office before having the party continue en route to their destination on the following day, March 12.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> They reached the <a href="Beidu_River" title="wikilink">Beidu River</a> on that day, boarding ships that would lead them to the Grand Canal, the central courier and trade artery of China that would carry them all the way to Beijing.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> At this point, water transport was the preferable means of travel for the courier agents; Choe wrote &quot;all envoys, tribute, and commerce come and go by water. If either the water in the locks and rivers is too shallow because of drought to let boats pass or there is a very urgent matter, the overland route is taken.&quot;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> When the party reached <a href="Ningbo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ningbo</a> on that day, Choe Bu remarked on the beautiful scenery; when they reached <a href="Cixi_City" title="wikilink">Cixi City</a>, he noted the city's many markets and cluttering of warships; upon entering Ningbo and reaching the Supreme Piracy-Defense Office, Choe wrote that the gates and crowds there were three times as great than at Cixi.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>After interrogating Choe Bu and Zhai Yong, Zhai was punished with a flogging for the recent fire-kicking incident, which officials of Ningbo cited as evidence of his lack of command.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Yet this wasn't the only offense; Zhai was flogged again when the party reached <a href="Hangzhou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hangzhou</a>, since he failed to meet the deadline in reaching his destination while escorting the Koreans.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The standard punishment was 20 strokes for a day's delay, with an additional stroke for every subsequent three days of delay and a maximum of 60.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Although this was perhaps a damper on their travel affair, Choe was impressed with the sights of Hangzhou, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It truly seems a different world, as people say ... Houses stand in solid rows, and the gowns of the crowds seem like screens. The markets pile up gold and silver; the people amass beautiful clothes and ornaments.

<p>Brook states that Choe correctly observed the fact that Hangzhou was the central trade city where ships from areas throughout southeast China congregated to take goods into the <a href="Jiangnan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jiangnan</a> region, the hotbed of commercial activity in China.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Due to the <a href="hai_jin" title="wikilink">hai jin</a> laws, the Ming government was the only entity allowed to conduct foreign trade; regardless of this prohibition, Choe was informed of the rampant illegal smuggling that passed through Hangzhou, bringing in sandalwood, pepper, and perfumes from <a href="Southeast_Asia" title="wikilink">Southeast Asia</a> and the <a href="Indian_Ocean" title="wikilink">Indian Ocean</a>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Yet this was a risky pursuit, as Choe was made aware that half the ships that engaged in this business did not return.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> On March 23, the Hangzhou prefectural government granted Choe's party a new escort, an official document explaining their presence in China, and lofty provisions of food and other items that were complements of the transport offices in charge of large-scale national transportation needs.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The party stayed in Hangzhou for another two days before departing on March 25.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The reason for the delay was due to courier officials' dutiful following of the handbook <em>Bureaucratic System of the Ming Dynasty</em> (<em>Da Ming guanzhi</em>), which was used to calculate through <a href="geomancy" title="wikilink">geomantic principles</a> which days were auspicious to depart on and which days were not.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> This same Chinese custom was later noted by the <a href="Portugal" title="wikilink">Portuguese</a> <a href="Dominican_Order" title="wikilink">Dominican</a> friar <a href="Gaspar_da_Cruz" title="wikilink">Gaspar da Cruz</a> while visiting <a href="Fujian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fujian</a> in 1575, nearly a century later.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Traveling 50 km (31 miles) on average per day, it would take the party 43 days from March 25 to May 9 to travel from Hangzhou to Beijing; even though the party spent a day's time in <a href="Suzhou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suzhou</a>, they still beat their deadline by two days, since 45 km (28 miles) was the courier system's standard traveling distance per day.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

<p>While traveling from Shandong into <a href="Hebei" title="wikilink">North Zhili</a>, Choe noticed a multitude of boats passing by which held officials from the <a href="Three_Departments_and_Six_Ministries" title="wikilink">Ministries of War, Justice, and Personnel</a>.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> When he questioned his escorts about this, Choe was told that the newly enthroned <a href="Hongzhi_Emperor" title="wikilink">Hongzhi Emperor</a> (r. 1488–1505) had recently impeached a large number of officials from office whom he considered inept and unworthy of their positions.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Brook writes that it was quite a comfortable privilege for disgraced and dismissed officials to be escorted by the courier service, yet even this saving of face was still a firm reminder of their banishment from court.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>

<p>Choe's account was translated <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">into English</a> in 1965 by John Meskill of the <a href="University_of_Arizona" title="wikilink">University of Arizona</a>, for the <a href="Association_for_Asian_Studies" title="wikilink">Association for Asian Studies</a>.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> Choe wrote in the usual tone of a learned Confucian scholar, which provides insight into the values and attitudes of early Joseon Confucian scholars.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a><a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Choe Bu's account is unique among foreign travel accounts in China, since it is from the perspective of a castaway, not a commonplace Korean <a href="Foreign_relations_of_Imperial_China" title="wikilink">ambassador to Ming China</a>.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> Historian Eugene Newton Anderson notes that, while pre-modern Koreans tended to adulate China and associate it with everything that was positive, Choe regarded it with a more objective outsider's perspective.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> When curious Chinese pressed Choe about Korea's rituals of <a href="ancestor_worship" title="wikilink">ancestor worship</a>, Choe responded, &quot;All my countrymen build shrines and sacrifice to their ancestors. They serve the gods and spirits they ought to serve and do not respect unorthodox sacrifices.&quot;<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> Historian Laurel Kendall writes that this was perhaps wishful thinking, but it reveals what a 15th-century Korean Confucian thought the Chinese would consider proper and in accordance with the teaching of <a href="Confucius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Confucius</a>.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> When a certain Chinese scholar Wang Yiyuan sympathized with Choe and his party's plight and served him tea, he asked Choe if the Koreans revered the <a href="Gautama_Buddha" title="wikilink">Buddha</a> as the Chinese did. Choe answered, &quot;my country does not revere the Buddhist law, it honors only the Confucian system. All its families make filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and sincerity their concern.&quot;<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<p>Although Choe did not adulate China to the extent of his peers and viewed it as an outsider, he did express in his writing a close affinity towards the Chinese, noting that Korea and China's cultures were hardly distinguishable from one another in terms of parallel values. For example, Choe wrote of a conversation he had with a Chinese officer who had shown him a great deal of hospitality during his travels, saying to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Certainly that shows your feelings that though my Korea is beyond the sea, its clothing and culture being the same as China's, it cannot be considered a foreign country ... All under Heaven are my brothers; how can we discriminate among people because of distance? That is particularly true of my country, which respectful serves the Celestial Court and pays tribute without fail. The Emperor, for his part, treats us punctiliously and tends us benevolently. The feeling of security he imparts is perfect.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, through the written dialogue in his diary, Choe did express slight differences between the cultures of China and Korea. For example, when the Chinese asked him whether or not the Korean education system offered degrees for specialists who dealt with only one of the Five Classics, Choe wrote that a Korean student who only studied one of the Classics and not all five of them was doomed to failing his exam and never attaining the rank of a full-fledged Confucian scholar.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<p>Choe's comments are valuable to historians seeking to better understand Chinese culture and civilization in the 15th century; for example, historians' seeking for clues about how widespread <a href="literacy" class="uri" title="wikilink">literacy</a> was in China, Choe's comment &quot;even village children, ferrymen, and sailors&quot; were able to read serves as a valuable piece of evidence.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a><a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> Moreover, Choe asserted that they could describe for him the mountains, rivers, old ruins, and other places in their regions, along with the significance of dynastic changes.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> Choe also bothered to list items such as the generous provisions provided by regional commanders, which included in one instance a plate of pork, two ducks, four chickens, two fish, one <a href="Wine_in_China" title="wikilink">beaker of wine</a>, one plate of rice, one plate of <a href="walnut" title="wikilink">walnuts</a>, one plate of vegetables, one plate of <a href="bamboo_shoot" title="wikilink">bamboo shoots</a>, one plate of <a href="Chinese_noodles" title="wikilink">wheat noodles</a>, one plate of <a href="jujube" class="uri" title="wikilink">jujube</a> fruit, and one plate of <a href="bean_curd" title="wikilink">bean curd</a>.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> Although he was offered wine in China, Choe asserts in his diary that he rejected the offer due to the continuing three-year mourning period for his late father.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> In addition to wine, he stated that he also abstained from eating &quot;meat, garlic, oniony plants, or sweet things&quot;.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> This strict adherence to Confucian principles by a Korean pleased his Chinese hosts.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<p>Choe also made observations about China's <a href="topography" class="uri" title="wikilink">topography</a> in each of the towns and villages he visited.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> His documenting of exact locations can aid historians in pinpointing old and lost places and structures. In his description of Suzhou, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In olden times, Suzhou was called Wukuai. It borders the sea in the east, commands three large rivers and five lakes, and has a thousand <em>li</em> of rich fields &lt;U+2026&gt; Le Bridge is inside the wall and separates Wu and Changzhou counties. Market quarters are scattered like stars. Many rivers and lakes flow through [the region], refreshing and purifying it.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
