<p><strong>Rowfant</strong> was a railway station on the <a href="Three_Bridges_to_Tunbridge_Wells_Central_Line" title="wikilink">Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells Central Line</a> in the parish of <a href="Worth,_West_Sussex" title="wikilink">Worth, West Sussex</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The line closed in 1967, a casualty of the <a href="Beeching_Axe" title="wikilink">Beeching Axe</a>. The route of the railway line cut a path through the estate of <a href="Curtis_Miranda_Lampson" title="wikilink">Curtis Miranda Lampson</a>, a wealthy American fur trader and vice-chairman of the <a href="Atlantic_Telegraph_Company" title="wikilink">Atlantic Telegraph Company</a>, who agreed to sell his land cheaply to the <a href="London,_Brighton_and_South_Coast_Railway" title="wikilink">London, Brighton and South Coast Railway</a> (LBSCR) on condition that a station be provided, together with the right to stop trains on request. Apart from Lampson's Rowfant House the only other nearby residence was Worth Hall owned by John Nix, an LBSCR director. At Lampson's request a shelter was provided for his coachmen.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="train-services">Train services</h2>
<p>Rowfant, initially the only intermediate station between <a href="Three_Bridges_railway_station" title="wikilink">Three Bridges</a> and <a href="East_Grinstead_railway_station" title="wikilink">East Grinstead</a>, saw an initial service of six passenger trains per day, with two on Sundays. By 1859 this had increased to nine services with one early morning goods train, and four Sunday services. The opening of another intermediate station in 1860, <a href="Grange_Road_railway_station" title="wikilink">Grange Road</a>, saw passenger trains cut to six on weekdays. An additional siding and <a href="Railroad_switch" title="wikilink">crossover</a> were provided in 1878, the siding serving a nearby <a href="brickworks" class="uri" title="wikilink">brickworks</a>. The station was further enlarged in 1900-1901 when it became a crossing station with a new 500 ft. Up platform and footbridge. In 1906 the introduction of new motor carriages led to an increase in weekday services.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="closure">Closure</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, Rowfant saw very little passenger traffic and jointly held with <a href="Kingscote_railway_station" title="wikilink">Kingscote</a> the record for the least revenue for passenger journeys on the LBSCR.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Although it saw a brief revival in terms of freight traffic when <a href="Gatwick_Airport" title="wikilink">Gatwick Airport</a> opened in the late 1950s and jet fuel was stored in the goods yard, its days were numbered and it closed with the rest of the line in January 1967 under the programme of closures put forward by local resident and <a href="British_Rail" title="wikilink">British Rail</a> Chairman, <a href="Richard_Beeching" title="wikilink">Richard Beeching</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-site-today">The site today</h2>
<p>Today the majority of the station survives, with the station site and goods yard occupied by a company producing road-building materials, <a href="Colas_ltd" title="wikilink">Colas Limited</a>. The station building, stationmaster's house and part of the Down platform survive. The Worth Way, a public footpath following the line of the railway, runs alongside the north face of the station building which is currently disused with its windows and doorways bricked up.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
