<p>The <strong>Ponttor</strong> in <a href="Aachen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aachen</a>, <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a>, (known in the 17th and 18th centuries as the <em>Br&lt;U+00FC&gt;ckenpforte</em> or <em>Br&lt;U+00FC&gt;ckenthor</em>) is one of the two remaining <a href="city_gate" title="wikilink">gates</a> of the original city wall of Aachen (the other being the Marschiertor). The western most of the north-facing gates (the other being the <em>Sandkaultor</em>, which no longer exists), the Ponttor was built in the 14th century and manned by soldiers and militia throughout the <a href="Free_Imperial_City_of_Aachen" title="wikilink">Free Imperial City of Aachen</a> era. Today, the Ponttor is used by German Youth and <a href="scouting" title="wikilink">Scout</a> groups belonging to the German Scount Club (1945) and the <a href="Deutsche_Pfadfinderschaft_Sankt_Georg" title="wikilink">German Scout Association Saint George</a>.</p>

<p>The Ponttor was constructed as a right-angled three-stock tower castle. In the main entrance, there is a <a href="Portcullis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Portcullis</a> as well as a <a href="machicolation" class="uri" title="wikilink">machicolation</a>, through which things could be dropped on invading forces. A bridge passage with <a href="merlon" title="wikilink">crenelations</a> spanned a <a href="moat" class="uri" title="wikilink">moat</a> and was strengthened in the foregate with two reinforced towers (<a href="barbican" title="wikilink">barbicans</a>). The building material was <a href="Devonian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Devonian</a> <a href="sandstone" class="uri" title="wikilink">sandstone</a>, <a href="Pennsylvanian_(geology)" title="wikilink">Pennsylvanian</a> carbonite sandstone and <a href="quartzite" class="uri" title="wikilink">quartzite</a>, with the framing material made of light <a href="bluestone" class="uri" title="wikilink">bluestone</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="explanation-of-the-name">Explanation of the name</h2>
<p>Though it is true that Aachen has many rivers and streams that pass through it, none are in the vicinity of the Ponttor, the name for which is assumed to come from the Latin word &quot;pons&quot;, meaning bridge. However, before the gate was named, the area of the city (as well as the area's main street) already carried this appellation, and thus the city gate is simply named for the area around it. The neighborhood received the name because of a bridge, as during <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Ancient Roman</a> times, a fortification existed on what is today known as the Annuntiaten stream. Beyond this area lay extensive swamps, and to exit the settlement, one would have to cross a bridge. Later settlements that were built in the area beyond the fortification were said to be beyond the bridge, and from this, the area, street, and city gate all got their names.</p>
