Throughout her career, she was compared by the media to Monroe and the other top sex symbol <a href="Mamie_Van_Doren" title="wikilink">Mamie Van Doren</a>. Mansfield had been a <em><a href="Playboy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Playboy</a></em> <a href="Playboy_Playmate" title="wikilink">Playmate of the Month</a> and appeared in the magazine several additional times.</p>

Of her rare on-screen dramatic roles, her performance in <em><a href="The_Wayward_Bus_(film)" title="wikilink">The Wayward Bus</a></em> (1957) is regarded as the best. She also sang for studio recordings including the album <em><a href="Shakespeare,_Tchaikovsky_&amp;_Me" title="wikilink">Shakespeare, Tchaikovsky &amp; Me</a></em> and the singles <em>Suey</em> and <em>As The Clouds Drift By</em> done together with rock legend <a href="Jimi_Hendrix" title="wikilink">Jimi Hendrix</a>.

<p>As the demand for blonde bombshells declined in the 1960s, Mansfield remained a popular celebrity, continuing to attract large crowds outside the U.S. and in lucrative and successful nightclub tours. Her film career continued with lower budget <a href="melodrama" title="wikilink">melodramas</a> and comedies, many filmed in the United Kingdom and Europe, including <em><a href="Heimweh_nach_St._Pauli" title="wikilink">Heimweh nach St. Pauli</a></em> and <em><a href="L&#39;Amore_Primitivo" title="wikilink">L'Amore Primitivo</a></em>.

<p>In her personal life she was successively married to her childhood lover Paul Mansfield (1950&lt;U+2013&gt;1958), actor-bodybuilder <a href="Mickey_Hargitay" title="wikilink">Mickey Hargitay</a> (1958&lt;U+2013&gt;1963) and film director <a href="Matt_Cimber" title="wikilink">Matt Cimber</a> (1964&lt;U+2013&gt;1966).

<p>Jayne Mansfield was the only child of Herbert William and Vera (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Jeffrey) Palmer (1903&lt;U+2013&gt;2003). Her birth name was Vera Jayne Palmer. A natural brunette, she was born in <a href="Bryn_Mawr,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania</a>, but spent her early childhood in <a href="Phillipsburg,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Phillipsburg, New Jersey</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> She was of <a href="German_people" title="wikilink">German</a> and <a href="English_people" title="wikilink">English</a> ancestry.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> When she was three years old, her father, a lawyer who was in practice with future <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a> governor <a href="Robert_B._Meyner" title="wikilink">Robert B. Meyner</a>, died of a <a href="myocardial_infarction" title="wikilink">heart attack</a> while driving a car with his wife and daughter. After his death, her mother worked as a school teacher. In 1939, when Vera Palmer married Sale Engineer Harry Peers, the family moved to <a href="Dallas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dallas</a>, <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a>.</p>
<p>She studied the <a href="University_of_Texas_at_Austin" title="wikilink">University of Texas at Austin</a> and <a href="dramatics" class="uri" title="wikilink">dramatics</a> at the <a href="University_of_Dallas" title="wikilink">University of Dallas</a>, having only attended <a href="Highland_Park_High_School_(University_Park,_Texas)" title="wikilink">Highland Park High School</a> until her junior year.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In Dallas, she became a student of actor <a href="Baruch_Lumet" title="wikilink">Baruch Lumet</a>, father of director <a href="Sidney_Lumet" title="wikilink">Sidney Lumet</a> and founder of the Dallas Institute of the Performing Arts. On October 22, 1953, she first appeared on stage in a production of <a href="Arthur_Miller" title="wikilink">Arthur Miller</a>'s <em><a href="Death_of_a_Salesman" title="wikilink">Death of a Salesman</a></em>. Frequent references have been made to Mansfield's very high <a href="IQ" class="uri" title="wikilink">IQ</a>, which she advertised as 163.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> She spoke five languages and was a classically trained <a href="piano" title="wikilink">pianist</a> and <a href="violin" title="wikilink">violinist</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Vera Jayne, who reportedly had an <a href="Intelligence_quotient" title="wikilink">Intelligence quotient</a> of 163,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> later complained that her public did not care about her brains. &quot;They're more interested in 40-21-35&quot;, she said.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In 1950, she married Paul Mansfield, and the couple moved to <a href="Austin,_Texas" title="wikilink">Austin, Texas</a>.

Between a variety of odd jobs, including a stint as a candy vendor at a movie theatre, she attended UCLA during the summer, and then went back to Texas for fall quarter at <a href="Southern_Methodist_University" title="wikilink">Southern Methodist University</a>.</p>
<p>While attending the University of Texas, she won several beauty contests, with titles that included &quot;Miss Photoflash&quot;, &quot;Miss Magnesium Lamp&quot;, and &quot;Miss Fire Prevention Week&quot;. The only title she ever turned down was &quot;Miss Roquefort Cheese&quot;, because she believed it &quot;just didn't sound right&quot;. While studying at Dallas, she acted in small theater productions of <em><a href="Anything_Goes" title="wikilink">Anything Goes</a></em>, <em><a href="Death_of_a_Salesman" title="wikilink">Death of a Salesman</a></em>, <em>The Salves of Demon Rum</em>, and <em>Ten Nights in a Barroom</em> in 1951.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> While at UCLA, she entered the <a href="Miss_California" title="wikilink">Miss California</a> contest, hiding her marital status, and won in the local round before withdrawing.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Early in her career, the prominence of her breasts was considered problematic, leading her to be cut from her first professional assignment, an advertising campaign for <a href="General_Electric" title="wikilink">General Electric</a>, which depicted several young women in bathing suits relaxing around a pool.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In 1954, she auditioned at both <a href="Paramount_Pictures" title="wikilink">Paramount Pictures</a> and <a href="Warner_Bros." title="wikilink">Warner Bros.</a> for a part in <em><a href="The_Seven_Year_Itch" title="wikilink">The Seven Year Itch</a></em>, failing to impress.

<h2 id="film-career">Film career</h2>
<h3 id="mid-1950s">Mid-1950s</h3>
<p>Mansfield's first movie role was as the supporting role of Candy Price in <em><a href="Female_Jungle" title="wikilink">Female Jungle</a></em> (1955), a low-budget drama filmed in just ten days. Mansfield's part was filmed in a few days and she received $150 for her performance ($ in  dollars). <em>Female Jungle</em> was released in January 1955 by producer Burt Kaiser. That year <a href="Paul_Wendkos" title="wikilink">Paul Wendkos</a> offered her the dramatic role of Gladden in <em><a href="The_Burglar" title="wikilink">The Burglar</a></em> (1957), his film adaptation of <a href="David_Goodis" title="wikilink">David Goodis</a>' novel. The film was done in <a href="film_noir" title="wikilink">film noir</a> style, and Mansfield appeared alongside <a href="Dan_Duryea" title="wikilink">Dan Duryea</a> and <a href="Martha_Vickers" title="wikilink">Martha Vickers</a>. <em>The Burglar</em> was released two years later, when Mansfield's fame was at its peak. She was successful in this straight dramatic role, though most of her subsequent film appearances would be either comedic in nature or capitalize on her sex appeal.</p>
<p>In early 1955, Mansfield was signed by <a href="Warner_Bros." title="wikilink">Warner Bros.</a> to a six month contract after one of its talent scouts discovered her in a production at the <a href="Pasadena_Playhouse" title="wikilink">Pasadena Playhouse</a>. Warner wanted Mansfield as their version of <a href="Marilyn_Monroe" title="wikilink">Marilyn Monroe</a> who was widely popular and lucrative for <a href="20th_Century_Fox" title="wikilink">20th Century Fox</a>. Mansfield was given a <a href="bit_part" title="wikilink">bit part</a> in <em><a href="Pete_Kelly&#39;s_Blues_(movie)" title="wikilink">Pete Kelly's Blues</a></em> (1955), which starred and was directed by <a href="Jack_Webb" title="wikilink">Jack Webb</a>. She made one more movie with Warner Bros., which gave her another small, but important role as Angel O'Hara, opposite <a href="Edward_G._Robinson" title="wikilink">Edward G. Robinson</a>, in <em><a href="Illegal_(1955_film)" title="wikilink">Illegal</a></em> (1955). The film offered another rare serious performance by Mansfield. After leaving Warner Bros., Mansfield made an uncredited <a href="cameo_appearance" title="wikilink">cameo appearance</a> in <em><a href="Hell_on_Frisco_Bay" title="wikilink">Hell on Frisco Bay</a></em> (1955), starring <a href="Alan_Ladd" title="wikilink">Alan Ladd</a>.</p>

<p>In 1955, she enjoyed a successful <a href="Broadway_theatre" title="wikilink">Broadway</a> run acting in <em><a href="Will_Success_Spoil_Rock_Hunter?_(play)" title="wikilink">Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?</a></em>. This wild comedy starred Mansfield as Rita Marlowe, a wild blonde Hollywood actress. The play also starred <a href="Orson_Bean" title="wikilink">Orson Bean</a> and <a href="Walter_Matthau" title="wikilink">Walter Matthau</a>. Returning to Hollywood on May 3, 1956, Mansfield signed a six-year contract with <a href="20th_Century_Fox" title="wikilink">20th Century Fox</a>. Fox wanted Mansfield to replace <a href="Marilyn_Monroe" title="wikilink">Marilyn Monroe</a>, their resident blonde sex symbol, and promoted her as &quot;Marilyn Monroe King Sized&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> She was then given her first starring role as Jerri Jordan in the film production of <a href="Frank_Tashlin" title="wikilink">Frank Tashlin</a>'s <em><a href="The_Girl_Can&#39;t_Help_It" title="wikilink">The Girl Can't Help It</a></em> (1956).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The film, originally titled <em>Do-Re-Mi</em>, featured a high-profile cast of contemporary Rock n Roll and R&amp;B artists including <a href="Gene_Vincent" title="wikilink">Gene Vincent</a>, <a href="Eddie_Cochran" title="wikilink">Eddie Cochran</a>, <a href="Fats_Domino" title="wikilink">Fats Domino</a>, <a href="The_Platters" title="wikilink">The Platters</a> and <a href="Little_Richard" title="wikilink">Little Richard</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Mansfield then played a dramatic role in <em><a href="The_Wayward_Bus_(film)" title="wikilink">The Wayward Bus</a></em> in 1957. In this film, she attempted to move away from her &quot;dumb blonde&quot; image and establish herself as a serious actress. This film was adapted from <a href="John_Steinbeck" title="wikilink">John Steinbeck</a>'s novel, and the cast included <a href="Dan_Dailey" title="wikilink">Dan Dailey</a> and <a href="Joan_Collins" title="wikilink">Joan Collins</a>. The film enjoyed reasonable success at the <a href="box_office" title="wikilink">box office</a>. She won a <a href="Golden_Globe" title="wikilink">Golden Globe</a> in 1957 for New Star Of The Year &lt;U+2013&gt; Actress, beating <a href="Carroll_Baker" title="wikilink">Carroll Baker</a> and <a href="Natalie_Wood" title="wikilink">Natalie Wood</a>, for her performance as a &quot;wistful derelict&quot; in <em>The Wayward Bus</em>. It was &quot;generally conceded to have been her best acting&quot;, according to <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em>, in a fitful career hampered by her flamboyant image, distinctive voice (&quot;a soft-voiced coo punctuated with squeals&quot;), voluptuous figure, and limited acting range.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Mansfield reprised her role of Rita Marlowe in the 1957 movie version of <em><a href="Will_Success_Spoil_Rock_Hunter?" title="wikilink">Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?</a></em>, co-starring <a href="Tony_Randall" title="wikilink">Tony Randall</a> and <a href="Joan_Blondell" title="wikilink">Joan Blondell</a>. <em>The Girl Can't Help It</em> and <em>Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?</em> were popular successes in their day and are considered classics. <em>Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?</em> is known as Mansfield's &quot;signature film&quot;, because she starred in both the play and film version.</p>
<p>Mansfield's fourth starring role in a Hollywood film was in <em><a href="Kiss_Them_for_Me_(film)" title="wikilink">Kiss Them for Me</a></em> (1957) in which she received prominent billing alongside <a href="Cary_Grant" title="wikilink">Cary Grant</a>. However, in the film itself, she is little more than comedy relief while Grant's character shows a preference for a sleek, demure redhead portrayed by fashion model <a href="Suzy_Parker" title="wikilink">Suzy Parker</a>. <em>Kiss Them for Me</em>, one of Mansfield's last starring roles, was a box office disappointment. The movie was described as &quot;vapid&quot; and &quot;ill-advised&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> It also marked one of the last attempts by 20th Century Fox to publicize her.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The continuing publicity around her physical presence failed to sustain her career.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Mansfield was then offered a part opposite <a href="James_Stewart" title="wikilink">James Stewart</a> and <a href="Jack_Lemmon" title="wikilink">Jack Lemmon</a> in <em><a href="Bell,_Book_and_Candle" title="wikilink">Bell, Book and Candle</a></em> (1958), but had to turn it down because of her <a href="pregnancy" class="uri" title="wikilink">pregnancy</a>. Afterward, Mansfield got word that her rival <a href="Kim_Novak" title="wikilink">Kim Novak</a> would replace her in the film.</p>
<p>In 1958, Fox gave Mansfield the lead role as Kate opposite <a href="Kenneth_More" title="wikilink">Kenneth More</a> in the western spoof <em><a href="The_Sheriff_of_Fractured_Jaw" title="wikilink">The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw</a></em>. Despite being filmed in 1958, <em>The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw</em>, was not released in the United States until 1959. <em>The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw</em> required Mansfield to sing three songs; she was not a trained singer, so the studio dubbed Mansfield's voice with singer/actress <a href="Connie_Francis" title="wikilink">Connie Francis</a>. When released in the United States, <em>The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw</em> became her last mainstream film success.</p>

<p>Despite the publicity and her public popularity, good film roles dried up for Mansfield after 1959. She kept busy in a series of low-budget films, mostly made in Europe. Fox tried to cast Mansfield opposite <a href="Paul_Newman" title="wikilink">Paul Newman</a> in his ill-fated first attempt at comedy, <em><a href="Rally_&#39;Round_the_Flag,_Boys!" title="wikilink">Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys!</a></em> (1958), but Mansfield's <em>Wayward Bus</em> co-star <a href="Joan_Collins" title="wikilink">Joan Collins</a> was selected instead.</p>
<p>In 1959, Fox lent her to appear in two independent gangster thrillers in England: <em><a href="The_Challenge_(1960_film)" title="wikilink">The Challenge</a></em>, co-starring <a href="Anthony_Quayle" title="wikilink">Anthony Quayle</a>, and <em><a href="Too_Hot_to_Handle_(1960_film)" title="wikilink">Too Hot to Handle</a></em>, co-starring <a href="Christopher_Lee" title="wikilink">Christopher Lee</a>. Both films were low-budgeted, and their American releases were delayed; <em>Too Hot to Handle</em> was released in the U.S. in 1961 as <em>Playgirl After Dark</em>, while <em>The Challenge</em> would not be seen by American audiences until 1963, under the title <em>It Takes a Thief</em>.</p>
<p>When she returned to Hollywood in mid-1960, 20th Century-Fox cast her in <em><a href="It_Happened_in_Athens" title="wikilink">It Happened in Athens</a></em> (1962). She received first billing above the title, but only appears in a supporting role. <em>It Happened in Athens</em> starred a handsome newcomer, Trax Colton, a &quot;unknown&quot; whom Fox was trying to mold into a big star. This Olympic Games-based film was shot in Greece, in the fall of 1960, but was not released until June 1962. It was a box-office flop, and Mansfield's 20th Century-Fox contract was dropped.</p>
<p>In 1961, Mansfield signed on to play Lisa Lang in, <em><a href="The_George_Raft_Story_(film)" title="wikilink">The George Raft Story</a></em>, starring <a href="Ray_Danton" title="wikilink">Ray Danton</a> as the actor. She accepted the part mainly for the money, and because the film was going to be filmed in Hollywood, rather in Europe. Soon after the release of <em>The George Raft Story</em>, Mansfield returned to European films to find work. Over the next few years, Mansfield mainly appeared in low-budgeted foreign films, such as <em><a href="Panic_Button_(1964_film)" title="wikilink">Panic Button</a></em>, <em><a href="Heimweh_nach_St._Pauli" title="wikilink">Heimweh nach St. Pauli</a></em>, <em><a href="Einer_Frisst_den_anderen" title="wikilink">Einer Frisst den anderen</a></em>, and, <em><a href="L&#39;Amore_Primitivo" title="wikilink">L'Amore Primitivo</a></em>.</p>
<p>In 1963, <a href="Tommy_Noonan" title="wikilink">Tommy Noonan</a> persuaded Mansfield to become the first mainstream American actress to appear nude with a starring role, in the film <em><a href="Promises!_Promises!" title="wikilink">Promises! Promises!</a></em>. Photographs of a naked Mansfield on the set were published in the June 1963 issue of <em><a href="Playboy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Playboy</a></em>, which resulted in obscenity charges being filed against <a href="Hugh_Hefner" title="wikilink">Hugh Hefner</a> in Chicago municipal court.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> <em>Promises! Promises!</em> was banned in <a href="Cleveland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cleveland</a>, but enjoyed box office success elsewhere. As a result of the film's success, Mansfield landed on the Top 10 list of Box Office Attractions for that year.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The autobiographical book, <em>Jayne Mansfield's Wild, Wild World</em>, which she co-authored with her husband at the time, <a href="Mickey_Hargitay" title="wikilink">Mickey Hargitay</a>, was published right after <em>Promises! Promises!</em> and contains 32 pages of black-and-white photographs from the film printed on glossy paper.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1966, Mansfield was cast in <em><a href="Single_Room_Furnished" title="wikilink">Single Room Furnished</a></em>, directed by her then husband <a href="Matt_Cimber" title="wikilink">Matt Cimber</a>. The film required Mansfield to portray three different characters and was Mansfield's first starring dramatic role in several years. It was briefly released in 1966, but was not officially released until 1968, almost a year after her death.</p>
<p>After the filming of, <em>Single Room Furnished</em> wrapped, Mansfield was cast opposite <a href="Mamie_Van_Doren" title="wikilink">Mamie Van Doren</a> and <a href="Ferlin_Husky" title="wikilink">Ferlin Husky</a> in <em><a href="The_Las_Vegas_Hillbillys" title="wikilink">The Las Vegas Hillbillys</a></em>, a low-budget comedy released by <a href="Woolner_Brothers" title="wikilink">Woolner Brothers</a>. Despite her career setbacks, Mansfield remained a highly visible personality through the early 1960s through her publicity antics and stage performances. In early 1967, Mansfield filmed her last film role: playing a <a href="cameo_appearance" title="wikilink">cameo</a> role in <em><a href="A_Guide_for_the_Married_Man" title="wikilink">A Guide for the Married Man</a></em> a comedy starring <a href="Walter_Matthau" title="wikilink">Walter Matthau</a>, <a href="Robert_Morse" title="wikilink">Robert Morse</a>, and <a href="Inger_Stevens" title="wikilink">Inger Stevens</a>. Mansfield received seventh billing<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> as &quot;Girl with Harold&quot;.</p>

Mansfield had the house painted pink, with <a href="cupid" title="wikilink">cupids</a> surrounded by pink fluorescent lights, pink furs in the bathrooms, a pink heart-shaped bathtub, and a fountain spurting pink champagne, and then dubbed it the <em>Pink Palace</em>. Hargitay, a plumber and carpenter before getting into bodybuilding, built a pink heart-shaped swimming pool. Mansfield decorated the Pink Palace by writing to furniture and building suppliers requesting free samples. She received over $150,000 ($ in  dollars) worth of free merchandise while paying only $76,000 ($ in  dollars) for the mansion itself,<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> a large sum nonetheless when the average house cost was under $7,500 ($ in  dollars) at the time.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

Work on Mansfield's film, <em><a href="Single_Room_Furnished" title="wikilink">Single Room Furnished</a></em> (in 1966), was suspended as her marriage to Cimber began to collapse in the wake of Mansfield's alcohol abuse, open infidelities, and her claim to Cimber that she had only ever been happy with her former lover, Nelson Sardelli.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

Photographs of the encounter were published around the world. The most famous image showed Loren's gaze falling upon the cleavage of the American actress who, sitting between Loren and her dinner companion, <a href="Clifton_Webb" title="wikilink">Clifton Webb</a>, had leaned over the table, allowing her breasts to spill over her low neckline and exposing one nipple.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The image was one of several taken in the same minutes as the image visible left. A similar incident, resulting in the full exposure of both breasts, occurred during a film festival in <a href="West_Berlin" title="wikilink">West Berlin</a>, when Mansfield was wearing a low-cut dress and her second husband, <a href="Mickey_Hargitay" title="wikilink">Mickey Hargitay</a>, picked her up so she could bite a bunch of grapes hanging overhead at a party; the movement caused her breasts to erupt out of the dress. The photograph of that episode was a <a href="UPI" class="uri" title="wikilink">UPI</a> sensation, appearing in newspapers and magazines with the word &quot;censored&quot; hiding the actress's exposed bosom.</p>
<p>The world's media were quick to condemn Mansfield's stunts, and one editorial columnist wrote, &quot;We are amused when Miss Mansfield strains to pull in her stomach to fill out her bikini better. But we get angry when career-seeking women, shady ladies, and certain starlets and actresses ... use every opportunity to display their anatomy unasked.&quot;<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> By the late 1950s, Mansfield began to generate a great deal of negative publicity because of her repeated successful attempts to expose her breasts in carefully staged public &quot;<a href="wardrobe_malfunction" title="wikilink">accidents</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Mansfield's most celebrated physical attributes would fluctuate in size as a result of her pregnancies and breast feeding five children. Her smallest measurement was 40D (102 cm) (which she was throughout the 1950s), and largest at 46DD (117 cm), when measured by the press in 1967. According to <em>Playboy</em>, her measurement was 40D-21-36 (102-53-91 cm) and her height was 5'6&quot; (1.68 m). According to her autopsy report, she was 5'8&quot; (1.73 m). Her bosom was so much a part of her public persona that talk-show host <a href="Jack_Paar" title="wikilink">Jack Paar</a> once welcomed the actress to <em><a href="The_Tonight_Show" title="wikilink">The Tonight Show</a></em> by saying, &quot;Here they are, Jayne Mansfield&quot;, a line that was written for Paar by <a href="Dick_Cavett" title="wikilink">Dick Cavett</a> and became the title of her biography by Raymond Strait.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Almost half a century after her death a biographer of <a href="Nikolaus_Pevsner" title="wikilink">Nikolaus Pevsner</a>, the German-born writer on British architecture, noted the improbable coincidence that he and Mansfield had once stayed at the same hotel in <a href="Bolton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bolton</a>, <a href="Lancashire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lancashire</a> and that she had &quot;electrified the dining room with her imposing bosom&quot;.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>

After an evening engagement on June 28, 1967, Mansfield, her lover Sam Brody, and their driver, Ronnie Harrison, along with the actress's children Mikl&lt;U+00F3&gt;s, Zolt&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, and <a href="Mariska_Hargitay" title="wikilink">Mariska</a>, set out in Stevens' <a href="Buick_Electra" title="wikilink">1966 Buick Electra 225</a> for <a href="New_Orleans" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a>, where Mansfield was to appear in an early morning television interview. Before leaving Biloxi, the party made a stop at the home of Rupert and Edna O'Neal, a family that lived nearby. After a late dinner with the O'Neals, during which the last photographs of Mansfield were taken, the party set out for New Orleans. On June 29 at approximately 2:25 a.m., on <a href="U.S._Route_90_in_Louisiana" title="wikilink">U.S. Highway 90</a> east of the <a href="Rigolets_Bridge" title="wikilink">Rigolets Bridge</a>, the car crashed into the rear of a <a href="semi-trailer_truck" title="wikilink">tractor-trailer</a> that had slowed because of a truck spraying <a href="insecticide" title="wikilink">mosquito fogger</a>. The automobile struck the rear of the trailer and went under it. Riding in the front seat, the three adults were killed instantly. The children in the rear survived with minor injuries.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>Rumors that Mansfield was <a href="decapitated" class="uri" title="wikilink">decapitated</a> are untrue, though she did suffer severe head trauma. This <a href="urban_legend" title="wikilink">urban legend</a> was spawned by the appearance in police photographs of a crashed automobile with its top virtually sheared off, and what resembles a blonde-haired head tangled in the car's smashed windshield. It is believed this was either a wig Mansfield was wearing or was her actual hair and scalp.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The death certificate stated the immediate cause of Mansfield's death was a &quot;crushed <a href="human_skull" title="wikilink">skull</a> with <a href="Avulsion_injury" title="wikilink">avulsion</a> of <a href="human_skull" title="wikilink">cranium</a> and brain&quot;.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Following her death, the <a href="National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration" title="wikilink">NHTSA</a> began requiring an <a href="semi-trailer_truck#Underride_guard" title="wikilink">underride guard</a>, a strong bar made of steel tubing, to be installed on all tractor-trailers. This bar is also known as a Mansfield bar, and on occasions as a DOT bar.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>Mansfield's funeral was held on July 3, in <a href="Pen_Argyl,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania</a>. The ceremony was conducted by a <a href="Methodism" title="wikilink">Methodist</a> minister, though Mansfield, who long tried to convert to <a href="Catholicism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Catholicism</a>, had become interested in <a href="Judaism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Judaism</a> at the end of her life through her relationship with Sam Brody.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> She is interred in Fairview Cemetery, southeast of Pen Argyl. Her gravestone was shaped as a heart and reads &quot;We Live to Love You More Each Day&quot;. A memorial <a href="cenotaph" class="uri" title="wikilink">cenotaph</a>, showing an incorrect birth year, was erected in the <a href="Hollywood_Forever_Cemetery" title="wikilink">Hollywood Forever Cemetery</a>, <a href="Hollywood,_California" title="wikilink">Hollywood, California</a>. The cenotaph was placed by The Jayne Mansfield Fan Club and has the incorrect birth year because Mansfield herself tended to provide incorrect information about her age.</p>

<p>Shortly after Mansfield's funeral, Mickey Hargitay sued his former wife's estate for more than $275,000 ($ in  dollars) to support the children, whom he and his third and last wife, Ellen Siano, would raise. Mansfield's youngest child, Tony, was raised by his father, Matt Cimber, whose divorce from the actress was pending when she was killed. In 1968, wrongful-death lawsuits were filed on behalf of Jayne Marie Mansfield and Matt Cimber, the former for $4.8 million ($ in  dollars) and the latter for $2.7 million ($ in  dollars).<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The <em>Pink Palace</em> was sold and its subsequent owners have included <a href="Ringo_Starr" title="wikilink">Ringo Starr</a>, <a href="Cass_Elliot" title="wikilink">Cass Elliot</a>, and <a href="Engelbert_Humperdinck_(singer)" title="wikilink">Engelbert Humperdinck</a>.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> In 2002, Humperdinck sold it to developers, and the house was demolished in November of that year.

<p>In 1980, <em><a href="The_Jayne_Mansfield_Story" title="wikilink">The Jayne Mansfield Story</a></em> aired on <a href="CBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">CBS</a> starring <a href="Loni_Anderson" title="wikilink">Loni Anderson</a> in the title role and <a href="Arnold_Schwarzenegger" title="wikilink">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> as Mickey Hargitay. It was nominated for three <a href="Emmy_Awards" title="wikilink">Emmy Awards</a>. In 1991, British band <a href="Siouxsie_and_the_Banshees" title="wikilink">Siouxsie and the Banshees</a> scored a U.S. top 20 hit-single with &quot;<a href="Kiss_Them_for_Me_(song)" title="wikilink">Kiss Them For Me</a>&quot;, a song which is an ode to Mansfield. Lyrics include the actress' catchword &quot;divoon&quot;, referring to her heart-shaped swimming pool and her love of champagne and parties, and to the grisly automobile accident.</p>
