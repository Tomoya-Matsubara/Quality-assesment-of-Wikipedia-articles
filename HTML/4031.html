<h2 id="life">Life</h2>
<p>He was the second son of the Reverend Walker King, <a href="Archdeacon_of_Rochester" title="wikilink">Archdeacon of Rochester</a> and rector of <a href="Stone,_Kent" title="wikilink">Stone, Kent</a>, and grandson of the Reverend <a href="Walker_King" title="wikilink">Walker King</a>, <a href="Bishop_of_Rochester" title="wikilink">Bishop of Rochester</a>; his nephew was the Reverend <a href="Robert_King_(footballer)" title="wikilink">Robert Stuart King</a>, who played football for England in 1882.</p>
<p>King graduated from <a href="Oriel_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Oriel College</a>, <a href="Oxford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxford</a>, was ordained in 1854, and four years later became chaplain and lecturer at Cuddesdon Theological College (now <a href="Ripon_College_Cuddesdon" title="wikilink">Ripon College Cuddesdon</a>). He was principal at Cuddesdon from 1863 to 1873, when he became <a href="Regius_Professor_of_Pastoral_Theology" title="wikilink">Regius Professor of Pastoral Theology</a> at <a href="Oxford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxford</a> and <a href="Canon_(priest)" title="wikilink">canon</a> of <a href="Christ_Church,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Christ Church</a>. He was the principal founder of the leading catholic theological college in the Church of England, <a href="St_Stephen&#39;s_House,_Oxford" title="wikilink">St Stephen's House, Oxford</a>, now a Permanent Private Hall of the University of Oxford. To the world outside he was known at this time as one of <a href="Edward_Pusey" title="wikilink">Edward Pusey</a>'s most intimate friends and as a leading member of the <a href="English_Church_Union" title="wikilink">English Church Union</a>. But in Oxford, and especially among the younger men, he exercised influence by his charm and sincerity.</p>
<p>In 1885 King was made <a href="Bishop_of_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Bishop of Lincoln</a>. The most eventful episode of his episcopate was his prosecution (1888&lt;U+2013&gt;1890) for <a href="Ritualism" title="wikilink">ritualistic practices</a> before the <a href="Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="Edward_White_Benson" title="wikilink">Edward White Benson</a>, and, on appeal, before the <a href="Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council" title="wikilink">Judicial Committee of the Privy Council</a>. Dr King, who loyally conformed his practices to the archbishop's judgment, devoted himself unsparingly to the work of his diocese; and, irrespective of his High Church views, he won the affection and reverence of all classes by his real saintliness of character. The bishop, who never married, died in Lincoln.</p>
