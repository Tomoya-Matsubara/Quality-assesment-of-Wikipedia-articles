<p><strong>Edwin Taylor Pollock</strong> (October 25, 1870 June 6, 1943) was a career <a href="Officer_(armed_forces)" title="wikilink">officer</a> in the <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">United States Navy</a>, serving in both the <a href="Spanish-American_War" title="wikilink">Spanish-American War</a> and <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>. He was subsequently promoted to the rank of <a href="Captain_(naval)" title="wikilink">captain</a>. Like many naval officers, his name was often abbreviated using initials: <strong> Pollock</strong>.</p>
<p>As a young <a href="Ensign_(rank)" title="wikilink">ensign</a>, Pollock served aboard the  during the Spanish-American War. After the war, he rose through the ranks, served on several ships, and did important research into wireless communication. In 1917, less than a week before the United States entered World War I, he won a race against a fellow officer to officially receive the <a href="United_States_Virgin_Islands" title="wikilink">U.S. Virgin Islands</a> from Denmark, and served as the territory's first acting governor. During the war, he was promoted to captain and a vessel under his command transported 60,000 American soldiers to France, for which he was awarded a <a href="Navy_Cross" title="wikilink">Navy Cross</a>. Afterward, he was made the eighth Naval Governor of <a href="American_Samoa" title="wikilink">American Samoa</a> and then the superintendent of the <a href="United_States_Naval_Observatory" title="wikilink">United States Naval Observatory</a>, before retiring in 1927.</p>

<p><img src="St._Thomas_-_Excerpt.JPG" title="fig:&quot;Beautiful Harbor of St. Thomas, West Indies&quot;, circa 1900" alt="&quot;Beautiful Harbor of St. Thomas, West Indies&quot;, circa 1900" />In the final days before the entrance of the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> into <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, the US military was concerned that <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a> was planning to purchase or seize the <a href="Danish_West_Indies" title="wikilink">Danish West Indies</a> for use as a <a href="submarine" class="uri" title="wikilink">submarine</a> or <a href="zeppelin" class="uri" title="wikilink">zeppelin</a> base.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> At the time, <a href="Charlotte_Amalie,_United_States_Virgin_Islands" title="wikilink">Charlotte Amalie</a> on <a href="Saint_Thomas,_U.S._Virgin_Islands" title="wikilink">Saint Thomas</a> was considered the best port in the <a href="Caribbean" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caribbean</a> outside of <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a>, and <a href="Coral_Bay,_United_States_Virgin_Islands" title="wikilink">Coral Bay</a> on <a href="Saint_John,_U.S._Virgin_Islands" title="wikilink">Saint John</a> was considered the safest harbor in the area.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Although the United States was not yet at war with Germany, the US signed a treaty to purchase the territory from Denmark for 25 million dollars on March 28, 1917. <a href="United_States_President" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="Woodrow_Wilson" title="wikilink">Woodrow Wilson</a> nominated <a href="James_Harrison_Oliver" title="wikilink">James Harrison Oliver</a> to be the first military governor.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The United States announced plans to build a naval base in the territory to aid in the protection of the <a href="Panama_Canal" title="wikilink">Panama Canal</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Oliver was unable to travel immediately to the Islands and the honor of being the first Acting Governor of the <a href="United_States_Virgin_Islands" title="wikilink">United States Virgin Islands</a> was decided in an unusual way. Both Pollock, commanding the , and B. B. Blerer's  were dispatched to the Islands in a race. The commander of the ship that arrived first would officiate at the transfer ceremony and be Acting Governor.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Pollock arrived first and the transfer ceremony took place on March 31, 1917, on Saint Thomas.

<h2 id="world-war-i">World War I</h2>
<p>During the war, Pollock was appointed as Captain on the , a German cruise liner which was seized by the United States government for use as a military transport ship. She was rechristened <em>George Washington</em> in September 1917 and Pollock was given her command on October 1, 1917. That December, she set out with her first load of troops. During the war, Pollock successfully transported 60,000 American soldiers to <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a> in 18 round trips.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In 1918, the <em>George Washington</em> was tasked to deliver <a href="United_States_President" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="Woodrow_Wilson" title="wikilink">Woodrow Wilson</a> to the <a href="Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919" title="wikilink">Paris Peace Conference</a>, though Pollock would not make the trip. He was reassigned on September 29, 1918.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>While on board the <em>George Washington</em>, Pollock and <a href="Chaplain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chaplain</a> Paul F. Bloomhardt edited a daily <a href="newspaper" class="uri" title="wikilink">newspaper</a>. After the war, stories from the paper were assembled and published in 1919 by J. J. Little &amp; Ives co. as <em>Hatchet of the United States Ship &quot;George Washington&quot;</em>. A short review of the work by <em><a href="The_Outlook_(New_York)" title="wikilink">Outlook</a></em> magazine called the book &quot;readable&quot; and &quot;admirably illustrated&quot;. It &quot;abounds in clever bits of fun, queer and notable incidents, and sound and patriotic editorials.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> After the war, he was eventually reassigned to the battleship , to serve in the Pacific fleet.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> On November 10, 1920, Pollock was awarded a <a href="Navy_Cross" title="wikilink">Navy Cross</a> for his services during the war.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="american-samoa">American Samoa</h2>
<p><img src="Aq-map.png" title="fig:Map of American Samoa" alt="Map of American Samoa" />On November 30, 1921, Pollock was transferred from command of the <em>Oklahoma</em> to become the Military Governor of <a href="American_Samoa" title="wikilink">American Samoa</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Events both personal and political led to a previous Governor Terhune's suicide on November 3, 1920, and the appointment of Governor <a href="Waldo_A._Evans" title="wikilink">Waldo A. Evans</a> to conduct a court of inquiry into the situation and to restore order. Pollock succeeded Evans, who had successfully restored the government and productivity of the islands after a period of unrest.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> At this time, American Samoa was administered by a team of twelve officers and a Governor, with a total population of approximately 8,000 people. The islands were primarily important due to the excellent harbor at Pago Pago.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Beginning in 1920, a <a href="Mau_movement" title="wikilink">Mau movement</a>, from the Samoan word for &quot;opposition&quot;, was forming in American Samoa in protest of several Naval government policies which natives (and some non-natives) found heavy-handed. The movement itself may have been inspired by a different and older Mau movement in nearby <a href="Western_Samoa" title="wikilink">Western Samoa</a>, against the German and then New Zealand colonial powers. Some of the initial grievances of the movement included the quality of roads in the territory, a marriage law which largely forbade natives from marrying non-natives, and a justice system which discriminated against locals in part because laws were not often available in Samoan. In addition, the United States Navy also prohibited an assembly of Samoan chiefs, who the movement considered the real government of the territory. Surprisingly, the movement grew to include several prominent officers of Governor <a href="Warren_Jay_Terhune" title="wikilink">Warren Jay Terhune</a>'s staff, including his <a href="executive_officer" title="wikilink">executive officer</a>. It culminated in a proclamation by <a href="Samuel_S._Ripley" title="wikilink">Samuel S. Ripley</a>, an <a href="American_Samoan" title="wikilink">American Samoan</a> from an <em>afakasi</em> or mixed-blood Samoan family, with large communal property in the islands, that he was the leader of a legitimate successor government to pre-1899 Samoa. Evans also met with the high chiefs and secured their assent to continued Naval government. Ripley, who had traveled to Washington to meet with <a href="Secretary_of_the_Navy" title="wikilink">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="Edwin_C._Denby" title="wikilink">Edwin C. Denby</a>, was not permitted by Evans to enter the port at American Samoa and returned to <a href="exile" class="uri" title="wikilink">exile</a> in California, where he became the mayor of Richmond.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>After being appointed as Governor, Pollock's continued the colonization work started by his predecessor. Prior to traveling to the territory, he met with Ripley in <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco, California</a>. Although Ripley maintained that American &quot;occupation&quot; of Samoa was usurpation, he agreed to allow Pollock to govern unfettered and to provide him with copies of his letters. Almost immediately after arriving on the island, Pollock and Secretary of Native Affairs S. D. Hall met with representatives of the Mau, becoming the first governor to do so. Shortly afterwards, some members of the Mau disbanded, though the movement would continue in some form for another thirteen years.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Pollock's remaining time as governor was less eventful. While exploring <a href="Tonga" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tonga</a> in May 1923, he discovered a turtle which had been branded by <a href="Captain_Cook" title="wikilink">Captain Cook</a> on his expedition there in 1773. The turtle was thus known to have lived more than 150 years.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> He was ordered home on July 26, 1923.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>On August 22, 1924, <a href="Mars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mars</a> came within  of Earth. The US Naval Observatory made no formal observations of the planet, but Pollock and the son of astronomer <a href="Asaph_Hall" title="wikilink">Asaph Hall</a> ceremonially re-enacted Hall's 1877 discoveries of the moons <a href="Phobos_(moon)" title="wikilink">Phobos</a> and <a href="Deimos_(moon)" title="wikilink">Deimos</a> with his original  <a href="telescope" class="uri" title="wikilink">telescope</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> They also made observations to calculate the masses of the two moons.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
