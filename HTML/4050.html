<h2 id="minor-leagues">Minor leagues</h2>
<p>Hamilton signed with Tampa Bay receiving a $3.96 million <a href="signing_bonus" title="wikilink">signing bonus</a>, and joined their minor league system.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> His first stop in the minors was the rookie level <a href="Princeton_Devil_Rays" title="wikilink">Princeton Devil Rays</a> of the <a href="Appalachian_League" title="wikilink">Appalachian League</a> where he played 56 games.

After this successful debut in professional baseball, he spent the  season with the <a href="Charleston_RiverDogs" title="wikilink">Charleston RiverDogs</a> in the <a href="South_Atlantic_League" title="wikilink">South Atlantic League</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> At the start of his pro career, Hamilton's parents quit their jobs so they could travel with their son.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Prior to the  season, Hamilton was involved in a car accident. His mother and father were also injured in the accident, and she went home with her husband to recuperate from their injuries. The 2001 season was also when he began experimenting with drugs and made his first attempt at rehab.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Hamilton only played 45 games in the 2001 season, split between Charleston (A-Ball) and the <a href="Orlando_Rays" title="wikilink">Orlando Rays</a>, a AA team in the <a href="Southern_League_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Southern League</a>. Hamilton began the  season with the <a href="Bakersfield_Blaze" title="wikilink">Bakersfield Blaze</a>, <a href="Batting_average" title="wikilink">batting</a> .303 with 9 <a href="home_run" title="wikilink">home runs</a> and 44 <a href="Run_batted_in" title="wikilink">RBI</a> in 56 games before his season came to an end due to lingering toe and neck injuries.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>At the start of the  season, Hamilton showed up late several times during spring training and was reassigned to the team's minor league camp. He left the team and resurfaced several times, but eventually took the rest of the season off for personal reasons. Hamilton was hoping to return to spring training with the <a href="2004_Tampa_Bay_Devil_Rays_season" title="wikilink">Devil Rays</a> in , but he was suspended 30 days and fined for violating the drug policy put in place by MLB. Because of the length of his suspension, and the terms of the drug policy, Hamilton must have failed two or more drug tests after being put into the program. A 'failed' test is a positive result for a drug more severe than <a href="Cannabis_(drug)" title="wikilink">marijuana</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> This suspension was increased several times after repeated violations of the terms of the program.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>From <a href="2004_Major_League_Baseball_season" title="wikilink">2004</a> until , Hamilton did not play baseball at all. He made several attempts at rehab, and started off the  season with hopes of being a star major league outfielder. <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> His return to baseball was helped along by former minor league outfielder and manager <a href="Roy_Silver" title="wikilink">Roy Silver</a>, who owns a baseball academy in Florida. After hearing about Hamilton's desire to return to baseball, Silver offered the use of his facility if Hamilton agreed to work there. After several months there, Hamilton attempted to play with an independent minor league team, but MLB stepped in and disallowed it. Hamilton was allowed to work out with the Devil Rays minor league players starting on June 2, 2006. By the end of the month, he was allowed to participate in minor league games.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> He played 15 games with the <a href="Hudson_Valley_Renegades" title="wikilink">Hudson Valley Renegades</a> at the end of the 2006 season.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In addition to returning to baseball, Hamilton also served as a cautionary tale for his young teammates with the Renegades. Rick Zolzer, the Renegades' director of special events said of Hamilton: &quot;&quot;He pointed (the other players) in the right direction. He said, 'Don't make the mistakes I made.' He was so good with all of the young kids.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="rule-5-draft">Rule 5 Draft</h2>
<p>Left off the Devil Rays' <a href="40-man_roster" title="wikilink">40-man roster</a>, Hamilton was selected third overall <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> in the 2006 <a href="Rule_5_Draft" title="wikilink">Rule 5 Draft</a>.
