<p><strong>&quot;A Song for Simeon&quot;</strong> is a 37-line poem written in 1928 by American-English poet <a href="T.&amp;nbsp;S._Eliot" title="wikilink">T.&amp;nbsp;S. Eliot</a> (1888&lt;U+2013&gt;1965). It is <a href="T._S._Eliot&#39;s_Ariel_poems" title="wikilink">one of five poems</a> that Eliot contributed to the <em><a href="Ariel_poems_(Faber)" title="wikilink">Ariel poems</a></em> series of 38 pamphlets by several authors published by <a href="Faber_and_Faber" title="wikilink">Faber and Gwyer</a>. &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; was the sixteenth in the series and included an illustration by <a href="avant_garde" title="wikilink">avant garde</a> artist <a href="Edward_McKnight_Kauffer" title="wikilink">Edward McKnight Kauffer</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The poems, including &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot;, were later published in both the 1936 and 1963 editions of Eliot's collected poems.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1927, Eliot had converted to <a href="Anglo-Catholicism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Catholicism</a> and his poetry, starting with the <em>Ariel Poems</em> (1927&lt;U+2013&gt;31) and <em><a href="Ash_Wednesday" title="wikilink">Ash Wednesday</a></em> (1930), took on a decidedly religious character.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; is seen by many critics and scholars as a discussion of the conversion experience. In the poem, Eliot retells the story of <a href="Simeon_(Gospel_of_Luke)" title="wikilink">Simeon</a> from the second chapter of the <a href="Gospel_of_Luke" title="wikilink">Gospel of Luke</a>, a just and devout Jew who encounters <a href="Mary,_mother_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">Mary</a>, <a href="Saint_Joseph" title="wikilink">Joseph</a> and the infant Jesus entering the <a href="Temple_of_Jerusalem" title="wikilink">Temple of Jerusalem</a>. Promised by the <a href="Holy_Ghost" title="wikilink">Holy Ghost</a> that he would not die until he had seen the Saviour, Simeon sees in the infant Jesus the <a href="Messiah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Messiah</a> promised by the Lord and asks God to permit him to &quot;depart in peace&quot; ().</p>
<p>The poem's narrative echoes the text of the <em><a href="Nunc_dimittis" title="wikilink">Nunc dimittis</a></em>, a liturgical prayer for <a href="Compline" class="uri" title="wikilink">Compline</a> derived from the Gospel passage. Eliot introduces literary allusions to earlier writers <a href="Lancelot_Andrewes" title="wikilink">Lancelot Andrewes</a>, <a href="Dante_Alighieri" title="wikilink">Dante Alighieri</a> and <a href="St._John_of_the_Cross" title="wikilink">St. John of the Cross</a>. Several critics have debated whether Eliot's depiction of Simeon is a negative portrayal of a Jewish figure and evidence of <a href="anti-Semitism" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-Semitism</a> on Eliot's part.</p>

<p>Critical reviews of Eliot's poems shifted as well, with some critics asserting that Eliot's work suffered with the addition of Christian themes.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> One critic, Morton Zabel said that this &quot;deprived his art of its once incomparable distinction in style and tone&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Other critics thought Eliot's exploration of Christian themes was a positive development in his poetry, including Gordon Symes, who recognised it as &quot;an evaluation of old age, an elucidation of its special grace, and an appreciation of its special function in the progress of the soul&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>&quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; is a 37-line poem written in <a href="free_verse" title="wikilink">free verse</a>. The poem does not have a consistent pattern of <a href="Meter_(poetry)" title="wikilink">meter</a>. The lines range in length from three syllables to fifteen syllables. Eliot uses <a href="end_rhyme" title="wikilink">end rhyme</a> sporadically in 21 lines of the poem, specifically:<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<ul>

<li><em>poor</em> and <em>door</em> (lines 10 and 12)</li>
<li><em>sorrow</em> and <em>to-morrow</em> (lines 20 and 24)</li>
<li><em>derision</em> and <em>vision</em> (lines 27 and 30)</li>
<li><em>stair</em> and <em>prayer</em> (lines 28 and 29)</li>
<li><em>heart</em> and <em>depart</em> (lines 32 and 36)</li>
</ul>
<p>Eliot's use of <em>lamentation</em>, <em>desolation</em> and <em>consolation</em>&lt;U+2014&gt;a repetition of the two-syllable <em>-ation</em> ending&lt;U+2014&gt;is an example of <a href="Syllable#Structure#Rime" title="wikilink">syllable rhyme</a>. Eliot employs <a href="Rhyme#Types_of_rhyme#General_rhymes" title="wikilink">forced rhyme</a> (also called &quot;oblique rhyme&quot;) on <em>peace</em> and <em>ease</em> (lines 8 and 11), and <a href="eye_rhyme" title="wikilink">eye rhyme</a> on <em>home</em> and <em>come</em> (lines 14 and 15).<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="gospel-narrative-and-the-nunc-dimittis">Gospel narrative and the <em>Nunc dimittis</em></h3>
<p>Most scholars and critics addressing the poem focus on the Gospel narrative for a source of interpretation as Eliot's poem quotes several lines verbatim from the passage in Luke, from the <em>Nunc dimittis</em>. Scofield says that the poem is &quot;characterized by deliberately Biblical language, interwoven with actual phrases from the Gospels&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>The subject of Eliot's poem is drawn from the second chapter of the Gospel of Luke (), and the early Christian <a href="canticle" class="uri" title="wikilink">canticle</a> <em><a href="Nunc_dimittis" title="wikilink">Nunc dimittis</a></em> derived from it.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> In Luke's account, Simeon, an aged and devout Jew, stands in the <a href="Temple_of_Jerusalem" title="wikilink">Temple of Jerusalem</a> at the time <a href="Mary,_Mother_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">Mary</a> and <a href="Saint_Joseph" title="wikilink">Joseph</a> bring the infant Jesus to be presented in the temple forty days after his birth in accordance with Jewish law and custom.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Luke states that Simeon is &quot;waiting for the consolation of Israel&quot; after being promised that &quot;he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ&quot;. () Simeon, upon seeing the child, takes him into his arms and prays, prophesizing the redemption of the world by Jesus and of suffering to come.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> This prayer would become known later as the <em>Nunc dimittis</em> from its Latin <a href="incipit" class="uri" title="wikilink">incipit</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Nunc dimittis</em> is the traditional &quot;Gospel Canticle&quot; of Night Prayer that is often called the <em>Song of Simeon</em> or <em>Canticle of Simeon</em>. In the <a href="Roman_Catholic" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a> tradition, it was used during the Office for <a href="Compline" class="uri" title="wikilink">Compline</a>, the last of the <a href="Canonical_hours" title="wikilink">Canonical hours</a>, in the <a href="Liturgy_of_the_Hours" title="wikilink">Liturgy of the Hours</a>.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The Anglican tradition combined liturgy of the Catholic offices of <a href="Vespers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vespers</a> (especially with the <em><a href="Magnificat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Magnificat</a></em> canticle) and Compline (with the <em>Nunc dimittis</em>) into <a href="Evening_Prayer_(Anglican)" title="wikilink">Evening Prayer</a> when compiling the <em><a href="Book_of_Common_Prayer" title="wikilink">Book of Common Prayer</a></em> during the <a href="English_Reformation" title="wikilink">English Reformation</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1886, Eliot's grandfather, <a href="William_Greenleaf_Eliot" title="wikilink">William Greenleaf Eliot</a>, an American educator and Unitarian minister, wrote a poem titled &quot;Nunc dimittis&quot;. Written a few months before his death (and two years before T. S. Eliot's birth,) the elder Eliot's poem used the same gospel text and the poet asks, in his decline, &quot;When may I humbly claim that kind award, / And cares and labors cease?&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; has been seen by Robin Griffith-Jones as a tacit tribute by Eliot to his grandfather, &quot;for the last years of a grandfather whose faith his grandson has at last taken up for himself&quot;.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>Scholars have identified allusions by Eliot to other biblical passages, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Before the stations of the mountain of desolation&quot; in line 19 and the reference to &quot;the fox's home&quot; in line 15 as a reference to <a href="Calvary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calvary</a> (<a href="Golgotha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Golgotha</a>), or to  &quot;the mountain of zion ... is desolate, the foxes walk upon it&quot;.

<li>The stations in line 19, and the time of cords, scourges and lamentation in line 17 refers to Christ's passion and crucifixion, in particular his scourging at the orders of Pontius Pilate and the lamenting of women along the <a href="Via_Dolorosa" title="wikilink">Via Dolorosa</a> described in .<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></li>

<p><img src="Lancelot_Andrewes_by_Simon_de_Passe_1618.jpg" title="fig:Eliot was influenced by an Ash Wednesday sermon (1619) of Anglican divine Lancelot Andrewes (pictured) that emphasised conversion as an act of turning toward God.|alt=&quot;Portrait of Lancelot Andrewes&quot;" alt="Eliot was influenced by an Ash Wednesday sermon (1619) of Anglican divine Lancelot Andrewes (pictured) that emphasised conversion as an act of turning toward God.|alt=&quot;Portrait of Lancelot Andrewes&quot;" /> &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; is not considered by scholars and critics to be one of Eliot's significant poems. It is thus overshadowed by his comparatively better known works of the period&lt;U+2014&gt;&quot;<a href="The_Hollow_Men" title="wikilink">The Hollow Men</a>&quot; (1925), written before his conversion; and &quot;The Journey of the Magi&quot; (1927), &quot;<a href="Ash_Wednesday" title="wikilink">Ash Wednesday</a>&quot; (1930), and the later, more substantial <em><a href="Four_Quartets" title="wikilink">Four Quartets</a></em> (1943), written after his conversion. However, in &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; and these poems, Eliot continues the progression of his themes of alienation in a changing world, and fuses with this the tenets of his newfound faith.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Scofield states that the imagery of &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;including the symbol of a feather, its setting amid Roman hyacinths and the winter sun&lt;U+2014&gt;conveys &quot;a sense of wonder and fragile new life&quot;.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a>. The Reverend Robin Griffith-Jones, an Anglican cleric, draws a connection between Eliot's image of the feather to a statement by <a href="Hildegard_of_Bingen" title="wikilink">Hildegard of Bingen</a> comparing herself &quot;to 'a feather which lacks all weight and strength and flies through the wind'; so she was borne up by God. But Eliot's speaker, still waiting for the wind to blow, imagines only the death wind that will bear him away&quot;.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>According to writer Joseph Maddrey, &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; shares themes with his more famous conversion poem &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot;, the first parts of which Eliot was writing when &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; was written and published. Eliot uses the biblical story of Simeon to illustrate the &quot;contrast between appearance and reality and humbly begs God to teach him the stillness that unifies the two&quot;.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Eliot's Ariel poems and &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; explore this new experience of conversion and the progress of the soul.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Scofield writes that Eliot's depiction of Simeon presents &quot;a figure to whom revelation has been granted but to whom it has come too late for this life&quot;.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> But as he awaits the death for which he asks, Simeon sees the consequences of the turning of faith to this new child and his mission.

According to Gordon, &quot;Eliot's penitent ... 'turning on the winding stair', acts out the two mental turns Andrewes prescribed for a conversion: a turn that looks forward to God and a turn that looks backward to one&lt;U+2019&gt;s sins, sentencing oneself for the past&quot;.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>The image of a winding stair has also been tied to scenes in Dante's journey from <a href="Purgatory" class="uri" title="wikilink">Purgatory</a> to <a href="Paradise" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paradise</a> in the <em><a href="Divine_Comedy" title="wikilink">Divine Comedy</a></em>.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Further, the image is thought associated with stairs as the path of mystical ascent in the writings of sixteenth-century <a href="Spanish_mystics" title="wikilink">Spanish mystic</a> <a href="Saint_John_of_the_Cross" title="wikilink">Saint John of the Cross</a>.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Eliot often alludes to this symbol in several of his poems.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>Eliot's Simeon appears similar to Dante's depiction of <a href="Virgil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virgil</a> in the <em>Divine Comedy</em>, as &quot;the seer who can see only so far; the precursor who cannot enter the world that he makes possible&quot;.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Virgil, in the <em>Divine Comedy</em>, leads Dante through Hell (<em><a href="Inferno_(Dante)" title="wikilink">Inferno</a></em>) and Purgatory (<em><a href="Purgatorio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Purgatorio</a></em>), but cannot guide him into Paradise (<em><a href="Paradiso_(Dante)" title="wikilink">Paradiso</a></em>). In this context, Virgil was a symbol of non-Christian philosophy and humanities could not help Dante any further in his approach to God.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> In Eliot's depiction, Simeon will never know the Christian culture he prophesizes, sensing &quot;the birth-pangs of a world that he will never occupy&quot;.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Anthony_Julius" title="wikilink">Anthony Julius</a>, a British lawyer who is one of Eliot's most trenchant critics on this issue, writes that &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; is &quot;exceptional in a poetry in which elsewhere Jews are dumb. The voice, however is a disciplined one and speaks lines prepared for it ... The song is <em>for</em>, not <em>of</em> Simeon. Eliot gives the Jew lines that locate him, and by implication all Jews, wholly within the Christian drama. Incapable of denying its truth, but equally incapable of living that truth.&quot;<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> He accuses Eliot of animating &quot;the <a href="Literary_topos" title="wikilink">topoi</a> of the Jew acknowledging his obsolescence&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;essentially employing a tired characterisation of a Jewish figure as a voice attesting that Jews have no role in the Christian future.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Julius compares Simeon to <a href="Moses" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moses</a> stating that he is &quot;fated to see the <a href="Promised_Land" title="wikilink">Promised Land</a> but not to enter it...witness to its truth, but denied its redemptive power, the Jew stands solemnly, humbly, outside Christianity's gates&quot;. Further, Julius draws on a quote from Eliot's earlier poem &quot;Gerontion&quot; to say that in this Christian future the Jews &quot;may find a ledge there to squat on&quot;.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>Julius' view is considered extreme by many critics.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Comparatively, Julius tempered his harsh criticism by claiming that Eliot's anti-Semitism does not detract from the poetry and that it offers a creative force showing rare imaginative power to Eliot's art.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Literary critic and professor <a href="Christopher_Ricks" title="wikilink">Christopher Ricks</a> agreed, citing the wit and commentary of Eliot's depictions of Jews; he asserts that Eliot was at his most brilliant in his prejudice.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
