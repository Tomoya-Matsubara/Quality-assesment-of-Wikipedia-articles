<h2 id="early-yearsbackground-information">Early years/background information</h2>
<p>Hornsby grew up listening to all types of music.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He graduated from James Blair High School in <a href="Williamsburg,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Williamsburg, Virginia</a> in 1973, where he played on the basketball team.

<p>In the spring of 1974, Hornsby's older brother Bobby, who attended the <a href="University_of_Virginia" title="wikilink">University of Virginia</a>, formed a band, &quot;Bobby Hi-Test and the Octane Kids&quot; to play fraternity parties, featuring Bruce on <a href="Fender_Rhodes" title="wikilink">Fender Rhodes</a> and vocals.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The band, which is listed in <em>Skeleton Key: A Dictionary for Deadheads</em>, performed covers of <a href="Allman_Brothers_Band" title="wikilink">Allman Brothers Band</a>, <a href="The_Band" title="wikilink">The Band</a>, and predominantly <a href="Grateful_Dead" title="wikilink">Grateful Dead</a> songs.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Although Hornsby's collaboration with Bobby Hornsby would be relatively short-lived, Bobby's son R.S. was a recurring guest-guitarist with Hornsby's band and periodically toured with his uncle.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Following his graduation from the <a href="University_of_Miami" title="wikilink">University of Miami</a>, in 1977, Bruce returned to Williamsburg and played in local clubs and hotel bars. In 1980, he and his younger brother (and songwriting partner) <a href="John_Hornsby" title="wikilink">John Hornsby</a> moved to <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>, where they spent three years writing for <a href="20th_Century_Fox" title="wikilink">20th Century Fox</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Hornsby also spent time in <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> as a <a href="session_musician" title="wikilink">session musician</a> and touring with <a href="Sheena_Easton" title="wikilink">Sheena Easton</a>'s band<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> before moving back to his native southeastern <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Hornsby currently uses a <a href="Steinway_&amp;_Sons" title="wikilink">Steinway &amp; Sons</a> concert grand piano. He bought the piano in <a href="Zurich,_Switzerland" title="wikilink">Zurich, Switzerland</a>, while on a solo show tour in Europe in 1995. With the Range and up until 1995, he used a <a href="Baldwin_Piano" title="wikilink">Baldwin</a> concert grand piano. He currently uses a <a href="Korg_M1" title="wikilink">Korg M1</a> synthesizer. With the Range, Hornsby used an <a href="Oberheim_OB-X" title="wikilink">Oberheim OB-X</a> synthesizer.</p>
<p>Outside the realm of music, Hornsby is a good <a href="basketball" class="uri" title="wikilink">basketball</a> player and an avid fan of the sport.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> As such, he can frequently be seen at college <a href="basketball" class="uri" title="wikilink">basketball</a> games around the state of <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> He is also a friend of <a href="St._Louis_Cardinals" title="wikilink">St. Louis Cardinals</a> manager <a href="Tony_LaRussa" title="wikilink">Tony LaRussa</a>, and attends games in Saint Louis whenever he can. Their friendship led to LaRussa introducing Hornsby to jazz bassist <a href="Christian_McBride" title="wikilink">Christian McBride</a>, which then led to the formation of The Bruce Hornsby Trio (along with drummer <a href="Jack_DeJohnette" title="wikilink">Jack DeJohnette</a>) and their first album, <em><a href="Camp_Meeting" title="wikilink">Camp Meeting</a></em>.</p>
<p>Bruce Hornsby was raised a <a href="Christian_Scientist" title="wikilink">Christian Scientist</a> and its influence can be seen in some of his songs.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Hornsby and his wife Kathy have sons named Russell and Keith who plays basketball for national powerhouse Oak Hill Academy.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> They were named after <a href="Leon_Russell" title="wikilink">Leon Russell</a> and <a href="Keith_Jarrett" title="wikilink">Keith Jarrett</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-range">The Range</h2>
<p>In 1984 he formed <strong>Bruce Hornsby and the Range</strong>, who were signed to <a href="RCA_Records" title="wikilink">RCA Records</a> in 1985. Besides Hornsby, Range members were <a href="David_Mansfield" title="wikilink">David Mansfield</a> (<a href="guitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitar</a>, <a href="mandolin" class="uri" title="wikilink">mandolin</a>, <a href="violin" class="uri" title="wikilink">violin</a>), George Marinelli (guitars and <a href="backing_vocalist" title="wikilink">backing vocals</a>), <a href="Joe_Puerta" title="wikilink">Joe Puerta</a> (<a href="bass_guitar" title="wikilink">bass guitar</a> and backing vocals), and <a href="John_Molo" title="wikilink">John Molo</a> (<a href="drum_kit" title="wikilink">drums</a>).</p>

<p>Hornsby's recording career started with the biggest hit he has had to date, entitled &quot;<a href="The_Way_It_Is_(song)" title="wikilink">The Way It Is</a>&quot;. It topped the American music charts in 1986.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> With a propulsive yet contemplative piano riff and the refrain, <em>That's just the way it is / Some things will never change / That's just the way it is / But don't you believe them</em>, the song was catchy and described aspects of the <a href="American_Civil_Rights_movement" title="wikilink">American Civil Rights movement</a> and institutional racism.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The song also hit a nerve with the American public, reflecting dissatisfaction with perceived economic decline in the early-to-mid 1980s. In years to come, the song would be sampled by at least six <a href="rapping" title="wikilink">rap</a> artists, including <a href="Tupac_Shakur" title="wikilink">Tupac Shakur</a>, <a href="E-40" class="uri" title="wikilink">E-40</a>, and <a href="Mase" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mase</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>With the success of the single worldwide, the album <em><a href="The_Way_It_Is_(Bruce_Hornsby_album)" title="wikilink">The Way It Is</a></em> went <a href="RIAA_certification" title="wikilink">multi-platinum</a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and produced another top five hit with &quot;<a href="Mandolin_Rain" title="wikilink">Mandolin Rain</a>&quot; (co-written, as many of Hornsby's early songs were, with his brother <a href="John_Hornsby" title="wikilink">John Hornsby</a>).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> &quot;<a href="Every_Little_Kiss" title="wikilink">Every Little Kiss</a>&quot; also did respectably well.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Other tracks on the album helped establish what some labeled the &quot;Virginia sound&quot;, a mixture of <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a>, <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a>, and <a href="bluegrass_music" title="wikilink">bluegrass</a> with an observational <a href="Southern_United_States" title="wikilink">Southern</a> feel.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Bruce Hornsby and the Range would go on to win the <a href="Grammy_Award_for_Best_New_Artist" title="wikilink">Grammy Award for Best New Artist</a> in 1987, beating out <a href="Glass_Tiger" title="wikilink">Glass Tiger</a>, <a href="Nu_Shooz" title="wikilink">Nu Shooz</a>, <a href="Simply_Red" title="wikilink">Simply Red</a> and <a href="Timbuk3" class="uri" title="wikilink">Timbuk3</a>.</p>
<p>Hornsby and the Range's sound is somewhat distinctive. For one, Hornsby's consistent use of <a href="syncopation" class="uri" title="wikilink">syncopation</a> in his piano solos was different from other pianists during the 1980s. Hornsby used a brighter piano sound, which was typical for 1980's Pop Music. There is also extensive use of <a href="synthesizer" title="wikilink">synthesizers</a> used as background for Hornsby's solos, most notable on the tracks &quot;The Show Goes On&quot; and &quot;The Road Not Taken&quot;. John Molo's drumbeats were often looped throughout the recorded versions of songs. They are typical double-time beats, which allowed Hornsby and the rest of the band to do more with their solos.</p>

<p>Hornsby and the Range's second album, <em><a href="Scenes_From_The_Southside" title="wikilink">Scenes From The Southside</a></em> (on which Peter Harris replaced Mansfield) was released in 1988. It featured such hits as &quot;Look Out Any Window&quot; and &quot;<a href="The_Valley_Road" title="wikilink">The Valley Road</a>&quot; which many critics noted due to their &quot;more spacious&quot; musical arrangements, allowing for &quot;more expressive&quot; <a href="piano" class="uri" title="wikilink">piano</a> solos from Hornsby.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The song &quot;<a href="Jacob&#39;s_Ladder_(Huey_Lewis_and_the_News_song)" title="wikilink">Jacob's Ladder</a>&quot; was featured as well, having originally been written by Hornsby for musician friend <a href="Huey_Lewis" title="wikilink">Huey Lewis</a>; Lewis' version became a number one hit from his album <em><a href="Fore!" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fore!</a></em>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> <em>Scenes</em> was successful as an album, once again offering slices of &quot;Americana&quot; and &quot;small-town nostalgia,&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> but it would be the group's last album to perform so well in the singles market.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1988, Hornsby first appeared on stage with the <a href="Grateful_Dead" title="wikilink">Grateful Dead</a>, a recurring collaboration that would continue until the band's dissolution.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Hornsby went on to appear on stage frequently as a guest before becoming a regular fixture in the touring lineup for the Dead a few years later. During the late 1980s and early 1990s Hornsby worked extensively as a producer and sideman, notably producing a comeback album for <a href="Leon_Russell" title="wikilink">Leon Russell</a>, an idol of Hornsby's.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In 1989 Hornsby co-wrote and played piano on <a href="Don_Henley" title="wikilink">Don Henley's</a> big hit &quot;<a href="The_End_of_the_Innocence_(song)" title="wikilink">The End of the Innocence</a>,&quot; and in 1991 played piano on <a href="Bonnie_Raitt" title="wikilink">Bonnie Raitt's</a> popular hit &quot;<a href="I_Can&#39;t_Make_You_Love_Me" title="wikilink">I Can't Make You Love Me</a>&quot;. Bruce continues to feature both of these songs in his own concerts. He also [appeared on albums by <a href="Bob_Dylan" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href="Robbie_Robertson" title="wikilink">Robbie Robertson</a>, <a href="Crosby_Stills_and_Nash" title="wikilink">Crosby Stills and Nash</a>, <a href="Stevie_Nicks" title="wikilink">Stevie Nicks</a> and <a href="Squeeze" class="uri" title="wikilink">Squeeze</a> during this time period.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>During this era he slowly began to slip jazz and bluegrass elements into his music, first in live performance settings and later on studio work.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In 1989, he first performed at the <a href="Telluride_Bluegrass_Festival" title="wikilink">Telluride Bluegrass Festival</a>. He also reworked his hit &quot;The Valley Road&quot; with the <a href="Nitty_Gritty_Dirt_Band" title="wikilink">Nitty Gritty Dirt Band</a> for their album <em><a href="Will_the_Circle_Be_Unbroken:_Volume_Two" title="wikilink">Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume Two</a></em>. The song won at the <a href="Grammy_Awards_of_1990" title="wikilink">1990</a> <a href="Grammy_Award" title="wikilink">Grammy Awards</a> for Best Bluegrass Recording.</p>
<p><em><a href="A_Night_on_the_Town_(Bruce_Hornsby_album)" title="wikilink">A Night On The Town</a></em> was released in 1990, on which he teamed up with jazz musicians <a href="Wayne_Shorter" title="wikilink">Wayne Shorter</a> and <a href="Charlie_Haden" title="wikilink">Charlie Haden</a> as well as bluegrass pioneer <a href="Bela_Fleck" title="wikilink">Bela Fleck</a>. A change in style became apparent as the album was much more rock- and <a href="guitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitar</a>-driven, making use of <a href="Jerry_Garcia" title="wikilink">Jerry Garcia</a>'s guitar work on a number of tracks, perhaps most prominently on the single &quot;Across the River&quot;.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In concert, Hornsby and the Range began to stretch out their songs, incorporating more and more &quot;freewheeling musical exchanges.&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Critics received the album quite well, praising it for its production, its political relevance, and Hornsby's gestures toward expanding out of a strictly pop sound by incorporating jazz and bluegrass.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Ultimately, though, the core &quot;rock band&quot; sound of the Range limited Hornsby's aspirations, and after a final three-week tour in 1991, Hornsby disbanded the outfit to enter a new phase of his career.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Drummer <a href="John_Molo" title="wikilink">John Molo</a> continued to perform regularly with Hornsby for another few years, although other members pursued separate musical endeavors. Following Hornsby's and Molo's involvement with <a href="The_Other_Ones" title="wikilink">The Other Ones</a>, Molo left Hornsby to become the primary drummer with <a href="Phil_Lesh" title="wikilink">Phil Lesh</a> and Friends.</p>

<h2 id="the-grateful-dead">The Grateful Dead</h2>
<p>Bruce Hornsby played over a hundred shows with the <a href="Grateful_Dead" title="wikilink">Grateful Dead</a>, beginning in 1988 and continuing until <a href="Jerry_Garcia" title="wikilink">Jerry Garcia</a>'s death in 1995.</p>
<p>Between September 1990 and March 1992, Hornsby played <a href="piano" class="uri" title="wikilink">piano</a> (and frequently <a href="accordion" class="uri" title="wikilink">accordion</a>) at every Grateful Dead gig, following the death of <a href="Brent_Mydland" title="wikilink">Brent Mydland</a>. After that period, <a href="Vince_Welnick" title="wikilink">Vince Welnick</a> became the sole keyboardist, although Hornsby still sat in with the band on occasion.</p>
<p>Hornsby's own music evolved significantly during this time period. Critics have suggested that Dead's vibrant tradition of melding <a href="folk_music" title="wikilink">folk music</a> and the <a href="blues" class="uri" title="wikilink">blues</a> with <a href="psychedelic_rock" title="wikilink">psychedelic rock</a> in &quot;loose-knit expressions&quot; and extended jamming &quot;further pushed [Hornsby] outside the confines of mainstream pop.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Critics have also commented upon the &quot;close musical connection&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> formed between Hornsby and <a href="Jerry_Garcia" title="wikilink">Jerry Garcia</a>, suggesting that Hornsby's particular style of jazz-fueled improvisation added to the band's repertoire,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> and helped to revitalize and refocus Jerry Garcia's guitar solos in the band's sound.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Hornsby's friendship with Garcia would continue, both inside and outside the band, as the two would &quot;challenge&quot; each other to expand their musicianship through several other album and live collaborations.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Above all, Hornsby's musical versatility and ability to slip in and out of extended freeform jams won over longtime Grateful Dead fans.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Hornsby originals &quot;The Valley Road&quot; and &quot;Stander on the Mountain&quot; appeared several times in the Dead's setlists. Hornsby also co-performs the improvisation &quot;Silver Apples of the Moon&quot; for the Grateful Dead's <em><a href="Infrared_Roses" title="wikilink">Infrared Roses</a></em>.</p>
<p>Beginning in the early 1990s, and continuing to the present, Hornsby's own live shows have drawn <a href="Deadhead" title="wikilink">Deadheads</a>; he reflects upon this phenomenon as follows: &quot;I've always liked the group of fans that we've drawn from the Grateful Dead time, because those fans are often adventurous music listeners.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Hornsby has paid tribute to his time with the Dead by performing a number of their songs during his concerts and by various homages on studio and live albums.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1994 the Grateful Dead were inducted into the <a href="Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> at the ninth annual induction dinner. Bruce Hornsby was their presenter.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> To this day, Hornsby continues to work with Dead-related projects, such as <a href="Bob_Weir" title="wikilink">Bob Weir</a>'s <a href="Ratdog" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ratdog</a>, <a href="Mickey_Hart" title="wikilink">Mickey Hart</a>'s solo projects, and in 2005 participated in a tribute concert to Jerry Garcia, &quot;Comes a Time.&quot; He has also sat in with <a href="The_Other_Ones" title="wikilink">The Other Ones</a> and <a href="The_Dead_(band)" title="wikilink">The Dead</a>.</p>
<h2 id="solo">Solo</h2>
<p>Hornsby would go on to release his first solo album, <em><a href="Harbor_Lights_(album)" title="wikilink">Harbor Lights</a></em>, in 1993. This record showcased him in a more jazz-oriented setting and featured an all-star lineup, including <a href="Pat_Metheny" title="wikilink">Pat Metheny</a>, <a href="Branford_Marsalis" title="wikilink">Branford Marsalis</a>, <a href="Jerry_Garcia" title="wikilink">Jerry Garcia</a>, <a href="Phil_Collins" title="wikilink">Phil Collins</a>, and <a href="Bonnie_Raitt" title="wikilink">Bonnie Raitt</a>. Unlike earlier albums, <em><a href="Harbor_Lights_(album)" title="wikilink">Harbor Lights</a></em> allowed more space for Hornsby's and guest-players' &quot;extended instrumental&quot; solos to &quot;flow naturally&quot; out of the songs.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The tone was set by the opening title track, which after 50 seconds of expansive solo piano lurches into an up-tempo jazz number, ending with <a href="Pat_Metheny" title="wikilink">Metheny</a>'s guitar runs. The album closes in a similar fashion with &quot;Pastures of Plenty&quot;, this time with an extended guitar solo from Garcia intertwined with Hornsby's piano. Hornsby also quotes the main musical phrase from the <a href="Grateful_Dead" title="wikilink">Grateful Dead</a>'s &quot;<a href="Dark_Star_(song)" title="wikilink">Dark Star</a>&quot; as the jazz head to his song about tensions surrounding a biracial relationship, &quot;Talk of the Town&quot;.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The mid-tempo &quot;Fields of Gray&quot;, written for Hornsby's recently-born twin boys, received some modest radio airplay. <em><a href="Harbor_Lights_(album)" title="wikilink">Harbor Lights</a></em> was well-received by critics and fans, who praised it for its &quot;cooler, jazzier sound&quot; and its &quot;affinity for sincere portraits of American life, love, and heartache.&quot;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Hornsby would also secure his third Grammy in 1993 for Best Pop Instrumental for &quot;Barcelona Mona&quot; (composed with <a href="Branford_Marsalis" title="wikilink">Branford Marsalis</a> for the <a href="Barcelona_Olympics" title="wikilink">Barcelona Olympics</a>).</p>

<p>In 1995, <em><a href="Hot_House_(album)" title="wikilink">Hot House</a></em> was released with its cover art, featuring an imagined jam session between <a href="bluegrass_music" title="wikilink">bluegrass</a> legend <a href="Bill_Monroe" title="wikilink">Bill Monroe</a> and <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a> legend <a href="Charlie_Parker" title="wikilink">Charlie Parker</a>, serving as an apt metaphor for the rich fusion of musical styles Hornsby was currently developing and expanding. This album would find Hornsby expanding upon the foray into jazz sound from <em><a href="Harbor_Lights_(album)" title="wikilink">Harbor Lights</a></em>, this time reintroducing elements of bluegrass from <em><a href="A_Night_on_the_Town_(Bruce_Hornsby_album)" title="wikilink">A Night On The Town</a></em> and his earlier collaborations.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Much like the socially-conscious lyrics of his earlier work, the underlying messages behind the catchy tunes are often very dark, such as on &quot;Country Doctor&quot;, &quot;Hot House Ball&quot; and &quot;White Wheeled Limousine&quot;, where story-telling lyrics build around spousal <a href="murder" class="uri" title="wikilink">murder</a>, <a href="nuclear_accidents" title="wikilink">nuclear disaster</a>, and wedding-day <a href="adultery" class="uri" title="wikilink">adultery</a>, respectively.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The album featured many of the same guests as on his previous record, such as <a href="Pat_Metheny" title="wikilink">Pat Metheny</a> and <a href="Jimmy_Haslip" title="wikilink">Jimmy Haslip</a>. <a href="B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la_Fleck" title="wikilink">B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la Fleck</a> also collaborates again on banjo. On the last song of the album &quot;Hot House,&quot; is the very last song Jerry Garcia played guitar on for a Bruce Hornsby album called &quot;Cruise Control.&quot; At a concert he performed in Buffalo, NY in August 2008 on the anniversary of Garcia's death, Bruce said that Garcia really wanted to play on the song &quot;Country Doctor&quot;, but due to his ailing health, he gave Garcia an easier tune to play.</p>
<p>As a testament to Hornsby's willingness to allow songs space to grow and evolve, it is worth noting that the song &quot;White Wheeled Limousine&quot; had debuted five years earlier as an encore to Branford Marsalis's opening act for the Grateful Dead's 12/31/90 New Year's Concert, (Marsalis and <a href="Rob_Wasserman" title="wikilink">Rob Wasserman</a> joined Hornsby in the performance).<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The <em>Hot House</em> version of &quot;White Wheeled Limousine&quot; pairs <a href="Pat_Metheny" title="wikilink">Pat Metheny</a>'s guitar with B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la Fleck's banjo for a blisteringly intricate call-and-response alongside Hornsby's piano runs.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> <em>Hot House</em> also makes an homage to Hornsby's years with the Dead via his recasting of the chorus/bridge of the Dead's song &quot;Estimated Prophet&quot; as the newly-lyricized Hornsby tune &quot;Tango King.&quot;<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The album also boasts a more prominent role for <em><a href="Harbor_Lights_(album)" title="wikilink">Harbor Lights</a></em> alum John D'earth on trumpet and introduces Bobby Read on woodwinds and J. V. Collier on bass. Read and Collier continue to perform with Hornsby to date.</p>

<td><p>&quot;To be creative, spontaneous in the moment and make music in the present tense, that's what we're all about live. I write the songs, we make the records and then the records become a departure point, the basic blueprint, the basic arrangement. I'm fairly restless creatively. I was never a very good Top 40 band guy because I never liked to play the same thing every time. Too often songwriters approach their songs like museum pieces. I don't subscribe to that.

<p>During this time period, &quot;even his concerts conveyed a looser, more playful mood, and Hornsby began taking requests from the audience.&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Hornsby's concerts became &quot;departure points&quot; for his album compositions, which would be blended with and reworked into &quot;lengthy spontaneous medleys&quot;.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Both in terms of audience requests and in terms of spontaneous on-stage decisions, Hornsby's performances became opportunities for him to challenge himself by trying to &quot;find a way to seamlessly thread these seemingly disparate elements together.&quot;<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Hornsby next worked with several Grateful Dead reformation projects, including several Furthur Festivals and the ultimate formation of <a href="The_Other_Ones" title="wikilink">The Other Ones</a>, which resulted in the release a live album, <em><a href="The_Strange_Remain" title="wikilink">The Strange Remain</a></em>. Hornsby's <a href="piano" class="uri" title="wikilink">piano</a> and vocals factor heavily into the band's performance of classic Dead tunes &quot;Jack Straw&quot; and &quot;Sugaree&quot; (which features Hornsby on lead vocal, in Jerry Garcia's absence), and Hornsby-originals &quot;White-Wheeled Limousine&quot; and &quot;Rainbow's Cadillac&quot; receive reworkings in the hands of The Other Ones.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p>Three years after <em>Hot House</em>, Hornsby released a <a href="double_album" title="wikilink">double album</a>, <em><a href="Spirit_Trail" title="wikilink">Spirit Trail</a></em>. Featuring a decidedly goofy picture of his uncle on the cover, the collection blends instrumental tracks with the story-telling, <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a>, jazz, and other musical forms Hornsby had delved into over his career. Over the two discs, Hornsby weaves a tapestry of varied textures, from the fervent spirituality then almost <a href="gospel_music" title="wikilink">gospel</a> dirge of &quot;Preacher in the Ring, parts I &amp; II,&quot; to the catchy chord progressions of &quot;Sad Moon.&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Among other homages, the song &quot;Sunflower Cat (Some Dour Cat) (Down With That)&quot; samples and loops the main lick from the Grateful Dead song &quot;China Cat Sunflower.&quot;<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> In some of the songwriter's most poignant lyrics to date, <em>Spirit Trail</em> considers &quot;very Southern&quot; themes with &quot;songs about race, religion, judgment and tolerance&quot; and &quot;struggles with these issues.&quot;<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Exemplary in this regard is the tune &quot;Sneaking Up on Boo Radley,&quot; which references the character from <a href="Harper_Lee" title="wikilink">Harper Lee</a>'s <a href="Pulitzer_Prize" title="wikilink">Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning novel <a href="To_Kill_a_Mockingbird" title="wikilink">To Kill a Mockingbird</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout the sequence of <em><a href="Harbor_Lights_(album)" title="wikilink">Harbor Lights</a></em>, <em>Hot House</em>, and <em>Spirit Trail</em>, Hornsby's piano playing steadily gained further complexity, taking on a more varied array of musical styles and incorporating more and more difficult techniques, as evidenced by his two-hand-independence on <em>Spirit Trail</em>'s &quot;King of the Hill.&quot;<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> During this same span of solo album years, Hornsby made several mini-tours playing solo piano gigs for the first time in his career.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> These shows allowed Hornsby limitless possibilities for seguing songs into other songs, often blurring lines between classical compositions, jazz standards, traditional bluegrass, <a href="folk_music" title="wikilink">folk</a>, and <a href="fiddle" class="uri" title="wikilink">fiddle</a> tunes, Grateful Dead songs, and, of course, reworkings of Hornsby originals.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Hornsby reflected on these periods of intensive solo performances stating that these solo tours helped him &quot;recommit [himself] to the study of piano&quot; and &quot;take [his] playing to a whole new level&quot;, explorations and improvisations that would not be possible in a band setting.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-noise-makers">The Noise Makers</h2>
<p>Hornsby's own touring band line up underwent extensive changes during the period from 1998 to 2000 as well, not the least of which was the apparent end of musical collaboration with long time drummer <a href="John_Molo" title="wikilink">John Molo</a>, who then became former <a href="Grateful_Dead" title="wikilink">Grateful Dead</a> bassist <a href="Phil_Lesh" title="wikilink">Phil Lesh</a>'s regular drummer in his post-Dead band <a href="Phil_Lesh_&amp;_Friends" title="wikilink">Phil Lesh &amp; Friends</a>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> A set of twenty consecutive shows performed by Hornsby and his band at <a href="Yoshi&#39;s_Jazz_Club" title="wikilink">Yoshi's Jazz Club</a> in <a href="Oakland,_CA" title="wikilink">Oakland, CA</a> would mark a particularly innovative period of evolution for his live shows; here Hornsby and his band were &quot;able to explore songs in a completely spontaneous fashion&quot;. From this point to the present Bruce has avoided even planning set lists for his shows, preferring to choose songs on the spot based mainly on audience requests.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> As Hornsby experimented with a different sound, ushering in frequent collaborations with such musicians as <a href="Steve_Kimock" title="wikilink">Steve Kimock</a> on guitar and Bobby Read on heavily effects-driven electronic woodwinds, his current band, dubbed <strong>Bruce Hornsby &amp; the Noise Makers</strong>, took shape. In 2000, Hornsby chronicled this journey with a compilation live album entitled <em><a href="Here_Come_The_Noise_Makers" title="wikilink">Here Come The Noise Makers</a></em>, and did extensive touring with his new band featuring John &quot;J. T.&quot; Thomas (<a href="keyboard_instrument" title="wikilink">keyboards</a>, <a href="organ_(music)" title="wikilink">organ</a>), Bobby Read (<a href="saxophone" title="wikilink">saxophones</a>, <a href="woodwinds" class="uri" title="wikilink">woodwinds</a>, <a href="flute" class="uri" title="wikilink">flute</a>), J.

<p><img src="BruuuceRequests.jpg" title="fig:Hornsby performing a solo piano show June 21, 2005 in North Bethesda, Maryland, audience requests visible across keyboard" alt="Hornsby performing a solo piano show June 21, 2005 in North Bethesda, Maryland, audience requests visible across keyboard" width="350" /><em><a href="Here_Come_The_Noise_Makers" title="wikilink">Here Come The Noise Makers</a></em> not only captures the ambience of one of Hornsby&lt;U+2019&gt;s concerts, but it also reflects the vibrant temperament and true stylistic diversity with which he approaches his craft, treating the live performance like a journey in search of the perfect musical moment.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> With this album, Hornsby is determined to create a hybrid style that encompasses <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a>, <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a>, and <a href="classical_music" title="wikilink">classical music</a> within a <a href="jam_band" title="wikilink">jam band</a> mentality.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The concert musical experience captured on the album embodied the gestures towards complete improvisatory musical spontaneity and towards recasting old songs as unrecognizably new that so much of Hornsby's solo work had been forecasting, this time in a full band setting.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The album covers pieces by many of Hornsby's musical influences, <a href="George_Gershwin" title="wikilink">George Gershwin</a>, <a href="Samuel_Barber" title="wikilink">Samuel Barber</a>, <a href="Bill_Evans" title="wikilink">Bill Evans</a>, <a href="Bud_Powell" title="wikilink">Bud Powell</a>, and <a href="Bob_Dylan" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan</a> among them.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Hornsby directly acknowledges the influence of the Dead by performing their songs &quot;Lady with a Fan&quot; and &quot;Black Muddy River&quot;<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> and by including a version of &quot;The Valley Road&quot; that seems to have &quot;emerged from the Grateful Dead's &quot;Wharf Rat.&quot;<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>His next studio album of new material was not until 2002: <em><a href="Big_Swing_Face" title="wikilink">Big Swing Face</a></em>. This album marked Hornsby's most experimental effort to date; <em>Big Swing Face</em>, the only album on which Hornsby barely plays any <a href="piano" class="uri" title="wikilink">piano</a>, relies heavily on post-electronica beats, drum loops, Pro Tools editing, and dense <a href="synthesizer" class="uri" title="wikilink">synthesizer</a> arrangements.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The album also boasts a &quot;stream-of-consciousness wordplay&quot; of lyrics that are in many ways more eccentric and humorous than previous work.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The <a href="jazz_fusion" title="wikilink">jazz fusion</a> jam on &quot;Cartoons &amp; Candy&quot; and the gesture towards Hornsby's <a href="jam_band" title="wikilink">jam band</a> influence with <a href="Steve_Kimock" title="wikilink">Steve Kimock</a>'s extended <a href="guitar_solo" title="wikilink">guitar solo</a> on &quot;The Chill&quot; highlight some of the album's only familiar territory,<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> and Hornsby cites the opening track, &quot;Sticks and Stones,&quot; as his partial homage to <a href="Radiohead" class="uri" title="wikilink">Radiohead</a>'s &quot;Everything in its Right Place.&quot;<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> <em>Big Swing Face</em> met mixed reviews ranging from &quot;a new and improved Bruce Hornsby&quot;<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> to feeling as if &quot;someone else is singing&quot; to the album being called one of the &quot;strangest records of 2002.&quot;<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Album sales were not helped by poor promotion from RCA, perhaps prompting Hornsby's decision to leave the label.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2004, after 19 successful years on RCA Records, Hornsby returned to a more acoustic, piano-driven sound on his <a href="Columbia_Records" title="wikilink">Columbia Records</a> debut <em><a href="Halcyon_Days_(Bruce_Hornsby_album)" title="wikilink">Halcyon Days</a></em>, which reviewers referred to as &quot;pure Hornsby&quot;.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Guests included <a href="Sting_(musician)" title="wikilink">Sting</a>, <a href="Elton_John" title="wikilink">Elton John</a>, and <a href="Eric_Clapton" title="wikilink">Eric Clapton</a>. The tracks &quot;Gonna Be Some Changes Made,&quot; &quot;Candy Mountain Run,&quot; &quot;Dreamland,&quot; and &quot;Circus On The Moon&quot; would become quick concert staples, each showcasing the diversity of Hornsby's improvisations and the Noise Makers' live sound. Notably, <em>Halcyon Days</em> also includes a suite of solo piano songs—&quot;What The Hell Happened,&quot; &quot;Hooray For Tom,&quot; and &quot;Heir Gordon&quot;—which all have a &quot;<a href="Randy_Newman" title="wikilink">Randy Newman</a> pastiche.&quot;<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Although the album was markedly less-risk-taking than <em><a href="Big_Swing_Face" title="wikilink">Big Swing Face</a></em>, it would be well-received as a &quot;winning balance of [Hornsby's] tuneful and adventurous sides.&quot;<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Throughout tours following the album's release, both with the Noise Makers and in solo performances, Hornsby continued to demonstrate his desire to &quot;grow&quot; as a singer and <a href="performer" class="uri" title="wikilink">performer</a> and to expand the instrumental possibilities of the piano in various genres.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> During this time period, Hornsby also began to offer CD-sets/digital downloads of digitally-mastered soundboard recordings of live concerts via the <em>Bruce Hornsby Live</em> website; selected concerts have been offered from 2002 to the present.</p>
<p>In July 2006, Hornsby released a 4 CD/1 DVD box set titled <em><a href="Intersections_(1985-2005)" title="wikilink">Intersections (1985-2005)</a></em>. The discs are thematically broken into three categories: &lt;U+201C&gt;Top 90 Time,&lt;U+201D&gt; &lt;U+201C&gt;Solo Piano, Tribute Records, Country-Bluegrass, Movie Scores,&lt;U+201D&gt; and &lt;U+201C&gt;By Request (Favorites and Best Songs)&lt;U+201D&gt; (2 CDs). A full third of the music is previously unreleased; many familiar tracks are presented as unreleased live versions rather than the original studio recordings, and the majority of the remaining tracks are from single &lt;U+201C&gt;B&lt;U+201D&gt; sides and aforementioned collaborations and/or tribute albums and movie soundtracks.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Some noteworthy collaborations include a piano-and-<a href="saxophone" class="uri" title="wikilink">saxophone</a> duet with <a href="Ornette_Coleman" title="wikilink">Ornette Coleman</a> and a performance with <a href="Roger_Waters" title="wikilink">Roger Waters</a> of <a href="Pink_Floyd" title="wikilink">Pink Floyd</a>'s &quot;Comfortably Numb.&quot;<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> The set also offers a number of excellent examples of Hornsby's re-inventiveness with his own compositions, particularly in a live setting,<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> for instance three different versions of &lt;U+201C&gt;The Valley Road&lt;U+201D&gt; are included--a live &quot;bluesy funk&quot; version with the Noise Makers, a <a href="Grammy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grammy</a>-winning <a href="bluegrass_music" title="wikilink">bluegrass</a> version with the <a href="Nitty_Gritty_Dirt_Band" title="wikilink">Nitty Gritty Dirt Band</a>, and &quot;a loose and sloppy but totally grooving boogie&quot; take with the Grateful Dead.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Critics have said that Hornsby's particular integrations of different musical genres, and his passion for reinventing his own compositions, create a kind of music many might &quot;never hear&quot; otherwise as it is &quot;a kind of music no one else is making.&quot;<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> All ticketholders on Hornsby's 2006 Solo Piano tour received a free copy of this set. Among <em>Intersections (1985-2005)</em> is the Grammy nominated track &quot;Song H,&quot; a new composition which competed for Best Pop Instrumental at the 2007 <a href="Grammy_Awards" title="wikilink">Grammy Awards</a>. In recent concerts, Hornsby has begun playing classical music. In a 2007 concert in <a href="Saint_Louis,_Missouri" title="wikilink">Saint Louis, Missouri</a>, during Hornsby's improvisational session in &quot;The Way It Is&quot;, he began playing <a href="J.S._Bach" title="wikilink">J.S. Bach</a>'s <a href="Goldberg_Variations" title="wikilink">Goldberg Variations</a> along with the drums. On that same tour in a different city, he played five straight Goldberg Variations over the effected drum intro of &quot;Gonna Be Some Changes Made.&quot;</p>
<p>On September 15, 2009, Bruce Hornsby and the Noisemakers released their fourth album, to mixed reviews. The album is titled <em><a href="Levitate_(Bruce_Hornsby_album)" title="wikilink">Levitate</a></em>. This album is somewhat musically different. Hornsby and the Noisemakers have gone as far as to not include piano solos. The first single, &quot;Levitate&quot;, was released on June 9, 2009.</p>
