<p><a href="Ensign_(Star_Trek)" title="wikilink">Ensign</a> <strong>Harry S. L. Kim</strong> is a <a href="fictional_character" title="wikilink">fictional character</a> who appeared in each of the seven seasons of the American <a href="television_series" title="wikilink">television series</a> <em><a href="Star_Trek:_Voyager" title="wikilink">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>. Portrayed by <a href="Garrett_Wang" title="wikilink">Garrett Wang</a>, he is the Operations Officer aboard the <a href="Starfleet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Starfleet</a> starship <a href="USS_Voyager_(Star_Trek)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Voyager</em></a>. There was some difficulty in casting the part prior to the start of the series in 2005, with a reported lack of young Asian actors to choose from.</p>
<p>The character first appeared in the pilot episode of the series, &quot;<a href="Caretaker_(Star_Trek:_Voyager)" title="wikilink">Caretaker</a>&quot;. The character continued to appear throughout the series in a main cast role, with his final appearance in the finale, &quot;<a href="Endgame_(Star_Trek:_Voyager)" title="wikilink">Endgame</a>&quot;. In that episode, an <a href="alternative_future" title="wikilink">alternative future</a> version of the character is seen as a Starfleet Captain. He is typically shown as being naive, especially in romantic situations, but gifted. The character finds the ship's first possible route home, and in one alternative future, he manages to develop a <a href="transwarp_drive" title="wikilink">transwarp drive</a> which allows him and <a href="Chakotay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chakotay</a> to travel home in a matter of hours but kills the rest of the crew. The producers had considered whether or not to kill off Kim during the third season. Wang subsequently reprised the role of Harry Kim for the fan-made <em><a href="Star_Trek:_Renegades" title="wikilink">Star Trek: Renegades</a></em>.</p>
<p>Reviewers said that Kim represented one of the elements of <a href="multiculturalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">multiculturalism</a> in the crew of <em>Voyager</em>, which also represented a proxy family for Kim. The storylines featuring Kim frequently had the character captured by aliens, something which was described as a typical <em>Voyager</em> storyline by critics. &quot;<a href="Timeless_(Star_Trek:_Voyager)" title="wikilink">Timeless</a>&quot; has been ranked as the best episode to feature Kim, and also the third best of the series, but holodeck episodes featuring Kim have also been listed by <a href="Io9" class="uri" title="wikilink">Io9</a> as some of the worst of their type in the franchise.</p>

<p>The character went through more than one name prior to casting, with it being called Jay Osaka at one point.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The <a href="Bible_(writing)" title="wikilink">series bible</a> for <em><a href="Star_Trek:_Voyager" title="wikilink">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> described Kim as being a sheltered individual who had sought to repay the love of his parents through fulfilling their expectations for him at <a href="Starfleet_Academy" title="wikilink">Starfleet Academy</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="Winrich_Kolbe" title="wikilink">Winrich Kolbe</a>, the director of the <em>Voyager</em> pilot &quot;<a href="Caretaker_(Star_Trek:_Voyager)" title="wikilink">Caretaker</a>&quot; was involved in the casting process and found Kim difficult as there wasn't a great number of young Asian actors to choose from.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He said that the role was a &quot;inexperienced, naive character&quot;, and that the actor cast as Kim would need to fight to stay in the forefront of episodes.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>At the time of the casting, Garrett Wang had only been acting for about a year and a half,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and after he was cast in the role he was described by Kolbe as a &quot;young, up-and-coming actor, but he needs to learn, and that's going to take some time. He's one of the actors who has to really work hard on his craft in order to keep up with the others.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The naivety of the character was emphasized in the media reports, with <em><a href="TV_Guide" title="wikilink">TV Guide</a></em> describing the character prior to the launch of the series as &quot;green-around-the-gills&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <a href="image:Garrett_Wang_at_FedCon_2013.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|right|upright|Garrett Wang was cast as Harry Kim, and appeared in all seven seasons of <em>Voyager</em> in that role.</a> Wang was enthusiastic about his new role, describing Kim's background by saying that &quot;I had a stellar Starfleet Academy career and am basically the rookie on the bridge. I'm an Asian-American. There's the professional competence, but also the inner fear, 'Oh my God, are these <a href="Breeches" title="wikilink">britches</a> too big for me?' His heritage is one of focus, of <a href="Zen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zen</a> and <a href="martial_art" title="wikilink">martial arts</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Of the casting, he said that he said that &quot;My goal now is to do the best job possible playing Harry Kim and to begin repaying my parents for the unaccountable financial support they have given me throughout the years.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The pilot of <em>Voyager</em> was broadcast on January 16, 1995.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Wang had initially gone along with the writing on the show until towards the end of the second season when he asked the production writers if he could have some actions scenes and perhaps a romance. He had realised at the time that he was the only member of the main cast without a <a href="stunt_double" title="wikilink">stunt double</a> as he had never had an action scene that required one. This resulted in the <a href="Brannon_Braga" title="wikilink">Brannon Braga</a> penned &quot;<a href="Non_Sequitur_(Star_Trek:_Voyager)" title="wikilink">Non Sequitur</a>&quot;, to which Wang said to <a href="Rick_Berman" title="wikilink">Rick Berman</a> that there wasn't a need to give him all his requests in a single episode. Following that, he became more involved in suggestions for character direction but the writers avoided given Kim more of a comedic element similar to <a href="The_Doctor_(Star_Trek)" title="wikilink">The Doctor</a> (<a href="Robert_Picardo" title="wikilink">Robert Picardo</a>) and <a href="Neelix" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neelix</a> (<a href="Ethan_Phillips" title="wikilink">Ethan Phillips</a>).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Wang described himself as someone who tells jokes and makes impersonations on sets and was disappointed at not being able to utilise this nature.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The producers at one point had planned to permanently kill off Harry Kim during season three, but after Wang was included in the <em><a href="People_(magazine)" title="wikilink">People</a></em> list of sexiest people alive 1997, the plan was abandoned.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>By season five of <em>Voyager</em>, certain characters were seen by the production staff as being under-utilised, Kim amongst them. This led to episodes placing Kim, Chakotay and Tuvok in central positions, including the episode &quot;<a href="Timeless_(Star_Trek:_Voyager)" title="wikilink">Timeless</a>&quot; for the character of Kim.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Wang was pleased with the episode, and felt that being able to act as the two different versions of Kim showed &quot;a great <a href="dichotomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">dichotomy</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Following the end of the show in 2001,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Wang had felt that the character should have been promoted during the course of the series, but was told by producers that &quot;someone's got to be the ensign&quot;.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>The authors of the book <em>Deep Space and Sacred Time: Star Trek in the American Mythos</em> thought that the episode &quot;Deadlock&quot; which featured the death of Kim was one of several examples in the <em>Star Trek</em> franchise where the death of an major character is reversed by a parallel existence.

<p>Amongst Kim's relationships included the relationship with a character on the ship's <a href="holodeck" class="uri" title="wikilink">holodeck</a> in the episode &quot;Alter Ego&quot;, but after building a rivalry for the character's affections with Tuvok, he becomes disinterested after finding out that the character was being played by a real person.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> This relationship was highlighted as an example of how <em>Star Trek</em> describes the ideal woman as an &quot;objectified embodiment of male desire with no inner self to complicate the so-called relationship that a man may have with her&quot;.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>Juliette Harrisson for the website <a href="Den_of_Geek" title="wikilink">Den of Geek</a> described &quot;Timeless&quot; as the best Harry Kim episode, and was the third best episode of <em>Voyager</em> overall.
