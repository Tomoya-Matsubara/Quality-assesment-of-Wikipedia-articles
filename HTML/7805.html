<p>Schulte was born in 1878 near <a href="St._Louis,_Missouri" title="wikilink">St. Louis, Missouri</a>. He played football at <a href="Smith_Academy" title="wikilink">Smith Academy</a> in St. Louis and then at <a href="Washington_Bears_football" title="wikilink">Washington University in St. Louis</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In 1903, Schulte transferred to the University of Michigan where he played at the <a href="Guard_(American_football)" title="wikilink">guard</a> and <a href="Center_(American_football)" title="wikilink">center</a> positions for <a href="Fielding_Yost" title="wikilink">Fielding Yost</a>'s famous &quot;Point-a-Minute&quot; teams of <a href="1903_Michigan_Wolverines_football_team" title="wikilink">1903</a>, <a href="1904_Michigan_Wolverines_football_team" title="wikilink">1904</a>, and <a href="1905_Michigan_Wolverines_football_team" title="wikilink">1905</a> -- teams the compiled a record of 33–1–1 over the three years Schulte was a starter. In late 1905 and early 1906, charges of professionalism were leveled at the major college football programs, including Michigan, leading to calls for reform or even elimination of the sport from college campuses. In response to the controversy, the faculty at Michigan ruled Schulte and two other football players, <a href="Germany_Schulz" title="wikilink">Germany Schulz</a> and <a href="Walter_Rheinschild" title="wikilink">Walter Rheinschild</a>, academically ineligible. As a result, Schulte missed the 1906 season.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Missouri hardly can afford to let 'Indian' Schulte, the football and track coach, leave the athletic department of the university, Schulte has had splendid success at Missouri. He has turned out well coached football teams and highly successful track teams. He has given Missouri in a coaching way what C. L. Brewer has supplied in the way of careful management and the upbuilding of a fine athletic plant. Schulte, an impulsive, impetuous fellow, is beloved of his boys. He has done much for Missouri athletics. He is entitled to the best Missouri can give him.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From 1919 to 1920, he was the head football coach at Nebraska, where he compiled an 8–6–3 record. He also served as the school's track coach from 1919 to 1938, and was an assistant coach for the football team from 1922 to 1927.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> One newspaper columnist noted that &quot;his work with the big, sturdy plainsmen of the Cornhusker state largely was responsible for the name the school built for itself.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Schulte was credited with building great football lines for Nebraska, evn in his years as an assistant coach; Notre Dame coach <a href="Knute_Rockne" title="wikilink">Knute Rockne</a> frequently mentioned Schulte as &quot;the greatest line coach in the game.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In 20 years as the <a href="Nebraska_Cornhuskers" title="wikilink">Cornhuskers</a>' track coach, Schulte coached his teams to 15 conference titles.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Schulte also served as a coach on the U.S. track team at the <a href="1928_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1928 Summer Olympics</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> At Nebraska, the track athletes coached by Schulte included <a href="Ed_Weir" title="wikilink">Ed Weir</a>, <a href="John_Rhodes" title="wikilink">John &quot;Choppy&quot; Rhodes</a>, <a href="Hugh_Rhea" title="wikilink">Hugh Rhea</a>, <a href="Sam_Francis" title="wikilink">Sam Francis</a> and <a href="Lloyd_Cardwell" title="wikilink">Lloyd Cardwell</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>In later years, Schulte served as an instructor at coaching schools. In 1934, Schulte taught track coaching at a program in which <a href="Fritz_Crisler" title="wikilink">Fritz Crisler</a> also taught football coaching. A newspaper story on the coaching school reflected the popularity of Schulte's classes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Henry 'Indian' Schulte, University of Nebraska, concluded his track and field work yesterday, and was given a rousing send-off by the 200 or more coaches who have been attending his lectures. It was the opinion of numerous coaches yesterday that the Texas Tech coaching school authorities would do well to sign Schulte immediately for another course next year. ... One of the most popular lecturers to appear here, Schulte, who is getting along in years but younger in ideas and thought, has had almost as large a following as any football coach on the staff.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
