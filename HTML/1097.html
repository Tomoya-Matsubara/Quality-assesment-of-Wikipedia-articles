As of 2007, the line consists of three <a href="Cognac_(drink)" title="wikilink">cognac</a>-based liqueurs, two vodka-based liqueurs, and two grades of cognac.</p>
<p>The first beverage in the line, Aliz&lt;U+00E9&gt; Gold Passion, was created in 1984 by Marie-Claude and Jean Paul Lafragette as a blend a blend of French cognac, <a href="Passiflora_edulis" title="wikilink">passion fruit</a> juice, and other exotic fruit juices.</p>
<p>Aliz&lt;U+00E9&gt; Gold Passion, Red Passion and Wild Passion are 16% <a href="Alcohol_by_volume" title="wikilink">alcohol</a> (32 proof). Vodka-containing varieties Aliz&lt;U+00E9&gt; Bleu and Aliz&lt;U+00E9&gt; Rose are 20% alcohol (40 proof). Aliz&lt;U+00E9&gt; VS and VSOP cognacs are 40% alcohol (80 proof).</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Aliz&lt;U+00E9&gt; was created when Marie-Claude Lafragette combined her family's cognac with Jean Paul Lafragette family's exotic jams. In 1984 Jean Paul was introduced to the Kobrand Corporation at the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America convention in New Orleans. A common company known as L &amp; L was created to produce and distribute Aliz&lt;U+00E9&gt;, which means 'a gentle <a href="Trade_wind" title="wikilink">trade wind</a>' in French. In 1986, Aliz&lt;U+00E9&gt; Gold Passion was introduced in the United States.</p>
<p>By the mid-1990s, Aliz&lt;U+00E9&gt; had gained widespread popularity among an urban audience. One brand director described its rise thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The cognac-based fruit-flavor liqueur idea really originated around 1986 with the introduction of Kobrand's Aliz&lt;U+00E9&gt;, which started out selling for about $25 a bottle, and was being targeted directly at 45- to 55-year-old white women. At the time, it seemed to make good sense. It was an easy product to drink, kind of delicious with passion fruit in it, and it had a classy cognac image. But it sat on a shelf for about 8 years and didn't move. The intended target audience just wasn't buying in.<br />
<br />
Then, about 1994, it was decided to liquidate the inventory. The shelf price was dropped to around $16 a bottle. Coincidentally, this was the same time the product began to appear in rap videos. In particular, the internationally-famous rap legend Tupac Shakur, came out with his video hit called &quot;<a href="All_Eyez_on_Me" title="wikilink">Thug Passion</a>&quot;, and rapped about <a href="Hennessy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hennessy</a>, Aliz&lt;U+00E9&gt; and <a href="Mo&lt;U+00EB&gt;t_et_Chandon" title="wikilink">Moet</a>. I'm convinced these three brands are still riding the waves of this notoriety even now. Anyway, four weeks after this hit came out, Shakur was assassinated, and these three brands just took off.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The packaging of Alize has undergone two major changes: a new bottle shape and an updated label with foil imprinting and a larger name in 2002<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, followed by a frosted bottle and silk screened label in 2006.</p>

<p>Throughout the 1990s Aliz&lt;U+00E9&gt; advertising involved promotions like a Culinary Mentorship Challenge, which offered the grand prize of a month-long study program at Le Cordon Bleu, and Operation Redhead, a collaboration with Manic Panic that chose 250 winners the opportunity to become redheads via a special-edition hue of hair dye.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
