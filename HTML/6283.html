<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<h3 id="early-career-1986u20131990">Early career (1986&lt;U+2013&gt;1990)</h3>
<p>Pestilence started in the <a href="Netherlands" class="uri" title="wikilink">Netherlands</a> in the mid 1986 as a <a href="thrash_metal" title="wikilink">thrash metal</a> band. The lineup, consisting of <a href="Patrick_Mameli" title="wikilink">Patrick Mameli</a> (guitar, vocals), Randy Meinhard (guitar), and Marco Foddis (drums), recorded two demos before gaining the attention of <a href="Roadrunner_Records" title="wikilink">Roadrunner Records</a>. After the first demo, <a href="Martin_van_Drunen" title="wikilink">Martin van Drunen</a> (bass, vocals) joined them. These two demos - <em>Dysentery</em> (1987) and <em>The Penance</em> (1987) - are raw, sounding mostly like a cross between <a href="Possessed_(band)" title="wikilink">Possessed</a> and <em>Schizophrenia</em>-era <a href="Sepultura" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sepultura</a>. After signing with Roadrunner, Pestilence released their debut album, <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em>, in 1988, further refining their approach to thrash metal. The new material was tighter and more focused than the demos.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pestilence recruited a new guitar player, Patrick Uterwijk. In 1989, the band released their second album, <em>Consuming Impulse</em>, a turn toward to <a href="death_metal" title="wikilink">death metal</a>. Musically, things became heavier and more haunting. Vocally, Martin van Drunen moved away from cleaner vocals in favour of a more acidic growl. With its release, Pestilence gained international attention, and became highly regarded worldwide by <a href="death_metal" title="wikilink">death metal</a> fans. But before a follow-up album was released, the lineup changed once again; vocalist and bassist Martin van Drunen departed to front <a href="Asphyx" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asphyx</a>.</p>
<h3 id="success-and-breakthrough-1991u20131994">Success and breakthrough (1991&lt;U+2013&gt;1994)</h3>
<p>Pestilence were faced again with the challenge of replacing a member, being without a vocalist and bassist. So while recording their third album <em>Testimony Of The Ancients</em> (1991), they enlisted bassist Tony Choy, who at the time was playing with the technical death metal band <a href="Cynic_(band)" title="wikilink">Cynic</a> and Patrick Mameli took over the vocal duties. With this lineup, they released the album <em>Testimony Of The Ancients</em>. The new material was not as abrasive as the previous albums, but the band's musicianship has obviously grown and the album had the best production job of the band's catalogue.</p>
<p>However, Tony Choy was never a permanent member, and ended up going back to <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a> to eventually play with <a href="Atheist_(band)" title="wikilink">Atheist</a>. In the meantime, Pestilence enlisted the talents of <a href="Jeroen_Paul_Thesseling" title="wikilink">Jeroen Paul Thesseling</a>.</p>
<p>Over the years, the Pestilence members were getting into other forms of music, primarily <a href="jazz_fusion" title="wikilink">jazz fusion</a> which, the band wanted to pair with metal. The band's fourth and final album, <em><a href="Spheres_(Pestilence_album)" title="wikilink">Spheres</a></em> was released in 1993. With every album, Pestilence went through some kind of a change and <em>Spheres</em> was no exception. Pestilence mixed jazz fusion elements into their death metal style, and used guitar synths throughout the album.</p>
<p>Pestilence's popularity had risen with the release of each album, but unfortunately, so did tensions between the members. So after a short period of time, the band unanimously decided to split up, feeling they had reached their creative climax.</p>
<h3 id="post-breakup-1995u20132007">Post-breakup (1995&lt;U+2013&gt;2007)</h3>
<p>In 1994, Roadrunner released one last CD from Pestilence: a best-of titled <em>Mind Reflections</em>, containing tracks from all four albums, plus the rare song &quot;Hatred Within&quot; (originally released on the <em>Teutonic Invasion Part II</em> compilation) and six unreleased live tracks recorded in at the <a href="Dynamo_Open_Air_Festival" title="wikilink">Dynamo Open Air Festival</a> in 1992. In 1998, <a href="Displeased_Records" title="wikilink">Displeased Records</a> re-released the debut album <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em> (which was originally never officially released in <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>), and included both demo recordings from 1986 and 1987.</p>
<p>In 2006, Metal War Productions, working with <a href="Martin_van_Drunen" title="wikilink">Martin van Drunen</a>, released <em>Chronicles of the Scourge</em>, containing two concert recordings and one unreleased bonus track. The two concerts are Live &quot;Kix Festival&quot; - Veghel, Holland (June 24, 1989) and Live Bochum, Germany (November 18, 1988). A bonus &quot;rehearsal disc&quot; was released with the first 1000 copies.</p>
<h3 id="reunion-2008u2013present">Reunion (2008&lt;U+2013&gt;present)</h3>
<p>A long period of inactivity ended in January 2008, when vocalist/guitarist Patrick Mameli told <a href="Blabbermouth.net" class="uri" title="wikilink">Blabbermouth.net</a> that Pestilence were back. The reunion line-up consisted of Mameli on vocals and guitar, <a href="Tony_Choy" title="wikilink">Tony Choy</a> on bass and <a href="Peter_Wildoer" title="wikilink">Peter Wildoer</a> on drums. Speaking to Blabbermouth.net regarding his decision to resurrect the band, Mameli had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's not a reunion, because I will not be playing with any of the old lineup guys, except Tony Choy, of course so... I always stated there WILL NEVER BE a reunion, and there won't be, since I never look back at the past and I refuse now to play with people that are not on the same musical level as I am.</p>
<p>I sang on <em><a href="Testimony_of_the_Ancients" title="wikilink">Testimony</a></em> and <em><a href="Spheres_(Pestilence_album)" title="wikilink">Spheres</a></em> (two albums later from <em><a href="Consuming_Impulse" title="wikilink">Consuming Impulse</a></em>!!), so no need for Martin. This because of the above statement I just made. Furthermore, Martin is doing other things. Good for him.</p>
<p>So now you have two members that were in Pestilence before and one new guy.</p>
<p>The reason why I bring Pestilence back to life is that people/fans keep asking me for this. The time is right now and Mascot is giving me the opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>As you know, I have always been the driving force behind Pestilence, writing all the music and so forth, so that I can state: I will bring back Pestilence to life. More tech and way more brutal than ever before.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2008, Pestilence decided to write and record new music for an early 2009 release working with <a href="Denmark" title="wikilink">Danish</a> producer Jacob Hansen. Titled <em><a href="Resurrection_Macabre" title="wikilink">Resurrection Macabre</a></em>, it is their first original album in sixteen years (since 1993's <em>Spheres</em>). In March 2008 Patrick Uterwijk re-joined the band as second-guitarist, however he didn't play on the new album.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In October 2009, <a href="Jeroen_Paul_Thesseling" title="wikilink">Jeroen Paul Thesseling</a> re-joined Pestilence after fifteen years of separation from the band, replacing <a href="Tony_Choy" title="wikilink">Tony Choy</a>'s bass position, a move that soon led to his departure from <a href="Obscura_(band)" title="wikilink">Obscura</a>.</p>
<p>In March 2010, Pestilence announced their first US summer tour in over 16 years which will begin at Maryland Deathfest at Sonar on May 30.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The reformed Pestilence released another album entitled &quot;Doctrine&quot; in April 2011.</p>
<p>On February 22, 2012, Patrick Mameli has announced that <a href="Jeroen_Paul_Thesseling" title="wikilink">Jeroen Paul Thesseling</a> and Yuma van Eekelen both left Pestilence, to commit more on their main projects, Thesseling's Nufutic, and van Eekelen's Exivious. Thesseling was replaced by <a href="Stephan_Fimmers" title="wikilink">Stephan Fimmers</a> (<a href="Necrophagist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Necrophagist</a>), and van Eekelen was replaced by <a href="Tim_Yeung" title="wikilink">Tim Yeung</a> (<a href="Morbid_Angel" title="wikilink">Morbid Angel</a>, <a href="Divine_Heresy" title="wikilink">Divine Heresy</a>, <a href="All_That_Remains_(band)" title="wikilink">All That Remains</a>, <a href="Hate_Eternal" title="wikilink">Hate Eternal</a>). The new two members will also be included in the recording session of the upcoming Pestilence album, <em>Obsideo</em>.</p>
