<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p><strong>Ghost Whisperer</strong> is a hidden-object game in which the player assumes the role of Melinda Gordon and is tasked with solving the paranormal mysteries taking place. There are two missions or &lt;U+201C&gt;cases,&lt;U+201D&gt; each with a unique storyline. While progressing through each case, the player frequently encounters various obstacles that must be cleared in order to progress further. These obstacles sometimes merely need to be &lt;U+201C&gt;unlocked&lt;U+201D&gt; using items that the player finds on the way, but they may also appear in the form of puzzles. By passing these obstacles, the player comes closer and closer to resolving each case as more story elements become revealed, culminating with the final, surprising resolution to the story. <br />
