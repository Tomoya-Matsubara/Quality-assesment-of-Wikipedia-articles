<p><strong>SMS Boa</strong> was a torpedo boat of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Built as a unit of the <em><a href="Python" class="uri" title="wikilink">Python</a></em> class, she was typical of the seagoing torpedo boats acquired by Austro-Hungary between 1896 and 1914. In 1910 she was renamed <strong>Torpedoboot 15.</strong></p>
<p><em>Boa</em> and her sister ships, <em>Python.</em> <em>Kigyo</em> and <em>Cobra,</em> were the result of competitive tests between two torpedo boats built in 1895-96. <em><a href="Natter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Natter</a></em> was built by the firm of F. Schichau at Elbing, while <em><a href="Viper" class="uri" title="wikilink">Viper</a></em> was built by Yarrow on the Thames at Millbank. Admiralty (<em>Marinesektion)</em> officials were better satisfied with the performance of <em><a href="Viper," class="uri" title="wikilink">Viper,</a></em> and four slightly larger examples were ordered from Yarrow.</p>
<p>A steel-hulled vessel of 132 tons displacement, <em>Boa</em> measured 152 feet six inches in length with a beam of 15 feet and a draft of four feet six inches. Her reciprocating engines of 1,800 horsepower gave a speed of 26 knots. Armament consisted of two 4.7cm quick-firing guns and three 17.7-inch torpedo tubes.</p>
<p>Launched on the Thames on 20 August 1898, <em>Boa</em> was completed on 24 September of that year. She and her sister ships formed a division of seagoing torpedo boats capable of challenging Italian forces in the event of war.</p>
<p>In 1910 a new nomenclature was introduced for all Austro-Hungarian torpedo boats. Existing names were discarded and replaced with numbers in the series <em>Torpedoboot 1</em> to <em>Torpedoboot 49.</em> <em>Boa</em> was renamed <em>Torpedoboot 15,</em> abbreviated <em>Tb 15.</em></p>
<p>During the First World War, <em>Tb 15</em> was employed as a convoy escort and minesweeper. Allocated to Britain as a war reparation in 1920, she was immediately sold and scrapped in Italy.</p>
