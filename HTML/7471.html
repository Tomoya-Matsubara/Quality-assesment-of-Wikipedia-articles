<p><strong>Diamond clarity</strong> is a quality of <a href="diamond" title="wikilink">diamonds</a> relating to the existence and visual appearance of internal characteristics of a diamond called <em>inclusions</em>, and surface defects called <em>blemishes</em>. Clarity is one of the <strong>four Cs</strong> of diamond grading, the others being <a href="carat_(mass)" title="wikilink">carat</a>, <a href="diamond_color" title="wikilink">color</a>, and <a href="diamond_cut" title="wikilink">cut</a>. Inclusions may be crystals of a foreign material or another diamond crystal, or structural imperfections such as tiny cracks that can appear whitish or cloudy. The number, size, color, relative location, orientation, and visibility of inclusions can all affect the relative clarity of a diamond. A clarity grade is assigned based on the overall appearance of the stone under 10x magnification.</p>
<p>Most inclusions present in gem-quality diamonds do not affect the diamonds' performance or structural integrity. However, large clouds can affect a diamond's ability to transmit and scatter light. Large cracks close to or breaking the surface may reduce a diamond's resistance to fracture.</p>
<p>Diamonds with higher clarity grades are more valued, with the exceedingly rare &quot;flawless&quot; graded diamond fetching the highest price. However, minor inclusions or blemishes are sometimes considered to have some value, as they can be used as unique identifying marks analogous to <a href="fingerprint" title="wikilink">fingerprints</a>. In addition, as <a href="synthetic_diamond" title="wikilink">synthetic diamond</a> technology improves and distinguishing between natural and synthetic diamonds becomes more difficult, inclusions or blemishes can be used as proof of natural origin.</p>
<h2 id="inclusions-and-blemishes">Inclusions and blemishes</h2>
<p>There are several types of inclusions and blemishes, which affect a diamond's clarity to varying degrees. Features resulting from <a href="diamond_enhancement" title="wikilink">diamond enhancement</a> procedures, such as <em>laser lines</em>, are also considered inclusions and/or blemishes.</p>

<p>The <a href="Gemological_Institute_of_America" title="wikilink">Gemological Institute of America</a> (GIA) developed a clarity grading system which has been used throughout the industry as well as by other diamond grading agencies including the <a href="American_Gemological_Society" title="wikilink">American Gemological Society</a> (AGS), <a href="European_Gemological_Laboratory" title="wikilink">European Gemological Laboratory</a> (EGL), and the <a href="International_Gemological_Laboratory" title="wikilink">International Gemological Laboratory</a> (IGL) use a sliding grading scale based on descriptive terms of overall clarity. These grading agencies base their clarity grades on the characteristics of inclusions visible to a trained professional when a diamond is viewed from above under 10x <a href="magnification" class="uri" title="wikilink">magnification</a>.</p>

<p>The GIA diamond grading scale is divided into six categories and eleven grades.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The clarity categories and grades are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flawless category (FL) diamonds that no inclusions or blemishes are visible under 10x magnification.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li>Internally Flawless category (IF) diamonds have no inclusions visible under 10x magnification, only small blemishes on the diamond surface<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
<li>Very, Very Slightly Included category (VVS) diamonds have minute inclusions that are difficult for a skilled grader to see under 10x magnification.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The VVS category is divided into two grades; VVS1 denotes a higher clarity grade than VVS2. Pinpoints and needles set the grade at VVS<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></li>
<li>Very Slightly Included category (VS) diamonds have minor inclusions that are difficult to somewhat easy for a trained grader to see when viewed under 10x magnification.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The VS category is divided into two grades; VS1 denotes a higher clarity grade than VS2. Typically the inclusions in VS diamonds are invisible without magnification, however infrequently some VS2 inclusions may still be visible to the eye. An example would be on a large emerald cut diamond which has a small inclusion under the corner of the table. <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
<li>Slightly Included category (SI) diamonds have noticeable inclusions that are easy to very easy for a trained grader to see when viewed under 10x magnification.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The SI category is divided into two grades; SI1 denotes a higher clarity grade than SI2. These may or may not be noticeable to the naked eye.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></li>
<li>Included category (I) diamonds have obvious inclusions that are clearly visible to a trained grader under 10x magnification.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Included diamonds have inclusions that are usually visible without magnification or have inclusions that threaten the durability of the stone. The I category is divided into three grades; I1 denotes a higher clarity grade than I2, which in turn is higher than I3. Inclusions in I1 diamonds often are seen to the unaided eye. I2 inclusions are easily seen, while I3 diamonds have large and extremely easy to see inclusions that typically impact the brilliance of the diamond, as well as having inclusions that are often likely to threaten the structure of the diamond. <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></li>

<p>The <a href="CIBJO" class="uri" title="wikilink">CIBJO</a> or the <em>International Confederation of Jewellery, Silverware, Diamonds and Stones</em> developed the <em>International Clarity Scale</em> for grading diamonds. This clarity scale mirrors the GIA grading scale, except nomenclature varies. The CIBJO system names these clarity grades; Flawless (FL), Loupe Clean, Very, very small inclusions (VVS1 and VVS2), Very small inclusions (VS1 and VS2), Small inclusions (SI1 and SI2), Pique (P1, P2, and P3)</p>
<h3 id="american-gem-society">American Gem Society</h3>
<p>The American Gem Society grades clarity on a number scale between 0 and 10. These numbers grades correlate almost exactly with the GIA system, but with some differences. The flawless and internally flawless (0) grades are grouped together with notation defining whether the stone is free from external blemishes, the VVS through SI grades are numbered 1 through 6, and then there are four grades 7 through 10 for the included category.</p>
<h3 id="european-gemological-laboratory">European Gemological Laboratory</h3>
<p>The <a href="European_Gemological_Laboratory" title="wikilink">European Gemological Laboratory</a> (EGL) introduced the SI3 as a clarity grade. While intended as a range to include borderline SI2 / I1 stones, it is now commonly used to mean I1's which are &quot;eye clean&quot;, that is, which have inclusions which are not obviously visible to the naked eye.</p>
<h2 id="clarity-grading-considerations">Clarity Grading Considerations</h2>
<p>All grades reflect the appearance to an experienced grader when viewed from above at 10x magnification, though higher magnifications and viewing from other angles are used during the grading process. In &quot;colorless&quot; diamonds, dark inclusions will tend to create the greatest drop of clarity grade. In other colors pale inclusions may have greater relief (may stand out more) and may cause a greater drop in grade.</p>
<p>Beyond the clarity grading terms, other considerations include the type, size and location of the &quot;inclusion&quot;. Inclusions near or on the surface may weaken the diamond structurally. Depending on where the inclusion occurs in the cut diamond and how it is to be used, it may be possible to hide the inclusion behind the setting.</p>
<h2 id="rarity-and-value">Rarity and value</h2>
<p>Diamonds become increasingly rare when considering higher clarity gradings . Only about 20 percent of all diamonds mined have a clarity rating high enough for the diamond to be considered appropriate for use as a gemstone; the other 80 percent are relegated to industrial use. Of that top 20 percent, a significant portion contains an inclusion or inclusions that are visible to the naked eye upon close inspection. Those that do not have a visible inclusion are known as &quot;eye-clean&quot; and are preferred by most buyers , although visible inclusions can sometimes be hidden under the setting in a piece of jewelry. The most popular gem diamonds fall within the VS and SI grades with FL, IF, and even VVS stones commanding significant premiums , while I stones are shunned by most buyers . FL and IF stones are sometimes referred to as &quot;museum quality&quot; or &quot;investment grade&quot; to denote their rarity , although the term &quot;investment grade&quot; is misleading as diamonds have historically been <a href="liquidity" title="wikilink">illiquid</a> and questionable stores of value.</p>
<h2 id="clarity-enhancement">Clarity enhancement</h2>

<p>Laser &quot;drilling&quot; involves using a laser to burn a hole to a colored inclusion, followed by acid washing to remove the coloring agent. The clarity grade is the grade after the treatment. The treatment is considered permanent and both the GIA and AGS will issue grades for laser drilled diamonds. Reputable vendors should disclose that laser drilling has been used.</p>
<p>Clarity can also be &quot;enhanced&quot; by filling the fracture much like a car windshield crack can be treated. Such diamonds are sometimes called &quot;<a href="fracture_filled_diamonds" title="wikilink">fracture filled diamonds</a>&quot;. Reputable vendors must disclose this filling and reputable filling companies use filling agents which show a flash of color, commonly orange or pink, when viewed closely. There is a significant price discount for fracture-filled diamonds. The GIA will not grade fracture-filled diamonds, in part because the treatment isn't as permanent as the diamond itself. Reputable companies often provide for repeat treatments if heat causes damage to the filling. The heat required to cause damage is that of a <a href="blowtorch" class="uri" title="wikilink">blowtorch</a> used to work on settings, and it is essential to inform anyone working on a setting if the diamond is fracture-filled, so they can apply cooling agents to the diamond and use greater care while working on it.</p>
