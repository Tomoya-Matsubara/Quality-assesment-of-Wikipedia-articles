<p>The <strong>goblin shark</strong> (<em>Mitsukurina owstoni</em>) is a rare, poorly known <a href="species" class="uri" title="wikilink">species</a> of deep-sea <a href="shark" class="uri" title="wikilink">shark</a>. Sometimes called a &quot;<a href="living_fossil" title="wikilink">living fossil</a>&quot;, it is the only extant representative of the <a href="family_(biology)" title="wikilink">family</a> <strong>Mitsukurinidae</strong>, a lineage some 125 million years old. This species looks unlike any other shark, with a long flattened snout, highly protrusible jaws containing prominent nail-like teeth, and pink coloration. It is usually between three and four meters (10&lt;U+2013&gt;13 ft) long when mature, though can grow considerably larger. Goblin sharks inhabit upper <a href="continental_slope" title="wikilink">continental slopes</a>, <a href="submarine_canyon" title="wikilink">submarine canyons</a>, and <a href="seamount" title="wikilink">seamounts</a> around the world at depths greater than , with adults found deeper than juveniles.</p>
<p>Various anatomical features of the goblin shark, such as its flabby body and small fins, suggest that it is sluggish in nature. This species hunts for <a href="teleost" class="uri" title="wikilink">teleost</a> fishes, <a href="cephalopod" title="wikilink">cephalopods</a>, and <a href="crustacean" title="wikilink">crustaceans</a> both near the <a href="sea_floor" title="wikilink">sea floor</a> and in the middle of the <a href="water_column" title="wikilink">water column</a>. Its long snout is covered with <a href="ampullae_of_Lorenzini" title="wikilink">ampullae of Lorenzini</a> that enable it to sense minute <a href="electric_field" title="wikilink">electric fields</a> produced by nearby prey, which it can snatch up by rapidly extending its jaws. Small numbers of goblin sharks are <a href="bycatch" title="wikilink">unintentionally caught</a> by deepwater <a href="fisheries" class="uri" title="wikilink">fisheries</a>. The <a href="International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="wikilink">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) has assessed it as <a href="Least_Concern" title="wikilink">Least Concern</a>, citing its wide distribution and low incidence of capture.</p>

<p><img src="Mitsu.JPG" title="fig:Differing jaw positions in preserved goblin sharks led to several specimens being erroneously described as distinct species." alt="Differing jaw positions in preserved goblin sharks led to several specimens being erroneously described as distinct species." /> American <a href="ichthyologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">ichthyologist</a> <a href="David_Starr_Jordan" title="wikilink">David Starr Jordan</a> described the goblin shark in an 1898 issue of <em><a href="Proceedings_of_the_California_Academy_of_Sciences" title="wikilink">Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences</a></em>, recognizing the peculiar fish not only as a new species but also a new <a href="genus" class="uri" title="wikilink">genus</a> and family. He based his account on an immature male  long caught in <a href="Sagami_Bay" title="wikilink">Sagami Bay</a> near <a href="Yokohama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yokohama</a>, Japan. The specimen had been acquired by <a href="shipmaster" class="uri" title="wikilink">shipmaster</a> and <a href="naturalist" class="uri" title="wikilink">naturalist</a> <a href="Alan_Owston" title="wikilink">Alan Owston</a>, who had given it to Professor Kachiki Mitsukuri at the <a href="University_of_Tokyo" title="wikilink">University of Tokyo</a>, who in turn had brought it to Jordan. Thus, Jordan named the shark <em>Mitsukurina owstoni</em> in honor of these two men.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The <a href="common_name" title="wikilink">common name</a> &quot;goblin shark&quot; is a translation of its old Japanese name <em>tenguzame</em>, a <em><a href="tengu" class="uri" title="wikilink">tengu</a></em> being a Japanese mythical creature often depicted with a long nose and red face.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Another name for this species is &quot;elfin shark&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Shortly after Jordan's description was published, several scientists noted the similarity between <em>Mitsukurina</em> and the extinct <a href="Mesozoic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mesozoic</a> shark <em><a href="Scapanorhynchus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scapanorhynchus</a></em>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> For a time, the prevailing view was to treat <em>Mitsukurina</em> as a <a href="junior_synonym" title="wikilink">junior synonym</a> of <em>Scapanorhynchus</em>. Eventually, more complete <a href="fossil" title="wikilink">fossils</a> revealed many anatomical differences between <em>Scapanorhynchus</em> and <em>Mitsukurina</em>, leading modern authors to again regard them as distinct genera.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Several goblin shark specimens were described as separate species from 1904 to 1937, none of which are now considered valid. This <a href="taxonomy_(biology)" title="wikilink">taxonomic</a> confusion arose because the specimens' jaws were fixed at varying degrees of protrusion during preservation, giving the appearance of proportional differences in the head.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p><a href="File:Mitsukurina_owstoni.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|upright=1.2|left|Early illustration of a goblin shark; this species is usually depicted in art and photographs with its jaws extended, which in life only happens during feeding.</a> The goblin shark has a distinctively long and flattened snout, resembling a sword blade. The proportional length of the snout decreases with age.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The eyes are small and do not have protective <a href="nictitating_membrane" title="wikilink">nictitating membranes</a>; behind the eyes are <a href="spiracle" title="wikilink">spiracles</a>. The large mouth is <a href="parabola" title="wikilink">parabolic</a> in shape. The jaws are highly protrusible and can be extended almost to the end of the snout, though normally they are held flush against the underside of the head. There are 35&lt;U+2013&gt;53 upper and 31&lt;U+2013&gt;62 lower tooth rows. The teeth in the main part of the jaws are long and narrow, particularly those near the sympysis (jaw midpoint), and are finely grooved lengthwise. The rear teeth near the corners of the jaw are small and have a flattened shape for crushing. There is much among-individual variation in tooth length and width, in whether the teeth have a smaller cusplet on each side of the main <a href="cusp_(dentistry)" title="wikilink">cusp</a>, and in the presence of toothless gaps at the symphysis or between the main and rear teeth. The five pairs of <a href="gill_slit" title="wikilink">gill slits</a> are short, with the <a href="gill_filament" title="wikilink">gill filaments</a> inside partly exposed; the fifth pair is above the origin of the <a href="pectoral_fin" title="wikilink">pectoral fins</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The body is fairly slender and flabby. The two <a href="dorsal_fin" title="wikilink">dorsal fins</a> are similar in size and shape, both being small and rounded. The pectoral fins are also rather small and rounded. The <a href="pelvic_fin" title="wikilink">pelvic</a> and <a href="anal_fin" title="wikilink">anal fins</a> have long bases and are larger than the dorsal fins. The <a href="caudal_peduncle" title="wikilink">caudal peduncle</a> is flattened from side-to-side and lacks keels or notches. The asymmetric <a href="caudal_fin" title="wikilink">caudal fin</a> has a long upper lobe with a shallow ventral notch near the tip, and an indistinct lower lobe.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The soft, semi-translucent skin has a rough texture from a covering of <a href="dermal_denticle" title="wikilink">dermal denticles</a>, each shaped like a short upright spine with lengthwise ridges. In life, this species is pink or tan due to visible <a href="blood_vessel" title="wikilink">blood vessels</a> beneath the skin; the color deepens with age, and young sharks may be almost white. The fins' margins are translucent gray or blue, and the eyes are black with bluish streaks in the <a href="iris_(anatomy)" title="wikilink">iris</a>. After death, the coloration quickly fades to dull gray or brown.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Adult sharks usually measure between three and four meters (10&lt;U+2013&gt;13 ft) long.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> However, the capture of an enormous female estimated at  long in 2000 showed that this species can grow far larger than previously suspected.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The maximum weight on record is  for a  long shark.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="distribution-and-habitat">Distribution and habitat</h2>
<p>The goblin shark has been caught in all three major oceans, indicating a wide global distribution. In the Atlantic Ocean, it has been recorded from the northern <a href="Gulf_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Gulf of Mexico</a>, Suriname, French Guiana, and southern Brazil in the west, and France, Portugal, <a href="Madeira" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madeira</a>, and Senegal in the east.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> It has also been collected from <a href="seamount" title="wikilink">seamounts</a> along the <a href="Mid-Atlantic_Ridge" title="wikilink">Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In the <a href="Indo-Pacific" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indo-Pacific</a> and <a href="Oceania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oceania</a>, it has been found off South Africa, Mozambique, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, and New Zealand. There is a single known eastern Pacific specimen, collected off southern <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> This species is most often found over the upper <a href="continental_slope" title="wikilink">continental slope</a> at depths of .<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> It has been caught as deep as , and a tooth has been found lodged in an undersea cable at a depth of .<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Adults inhabit greater depths than juveniles.

<h2 id="biology-and-ecology">Biology and ecology</h2>
<p>Although observations of living goblin sharks are scant, its anatomy suggests that it leads an inactive and sluggish lifestyle. Its skeleton is reduced and poorly <a href="calcification" title="wikilink">calcified</a>, the muscle blocks along its sides (<a href="myomere" title="wikilink">myomeres</a>) are weakly developed, and its fins are soft and small. Its long caudal fin, held at a low angle, is also typical of a slow-swimming shark. The long snout appears to have a sensory function, as it bears numerous <a href="ampullae_of_Lorenzini" title="wikilink">ampullae of Lorenzini</a> that can <a href="electroreception" title="wikilink">detect</a> the weak <a href="electric_field" title="wikilink">electric fields</a> produced by other animals. Due to the snout's lack of rigidity, it is unlikely to be used for stirring up prey from the bottom as has been proposed.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Vision seems to be less important than other senses, considering the relatively small <a href="optic_tectum" title="wikilink">optic tectum</a> in the shark's brain.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Yet unlike most deep-sea sharks, it can change the size of its <a href="pupil" title="wikilink">pupils</a> and thus probably does use its sight in some situations.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Goblin sharks may fall prey to the <a href="blue_shark" title="wikilink">blue shark</a> (<em>Prionace glauca</em>).<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> <a href="Parasite" title="wikilink">Parasites</a> documented from this species include the <a href="copepod" class="uri" title="wikilink">copepod</a> <em><a href="Echthrogaleus_mitsukurinae" title="wikilink">Echthrogaleus mitsukurinae</a></em>,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> and the <a href="tapeworm" title="wikilink">tapeworms</a> <em><a href="Litobothrium_amsichensis" title="wikilink">Litobothrium amsichensis</a></em> and <em><a href="Marsupiobothrium_gobelinus" title="wikilink">Marsupiobothrium gobelinus</a></em>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="feeding">Feeding</h3>
<p><img src="CoryphaenoidesLeptolepis.jpg" title="fig:Rattails and other deep-living teleosts are the main food of the goblin shark." alt="Rattails and other deep-living teleosts are the main food of the goblin shark." /> The goblin shark feeds mainly on <a href="teleost" class="uri" title="wikilink">teleost</a> fishes such as <a href="rattail" title="wikilink">rattails</a> and <a href="Stomiidae" title="wikilink">dragonfishes</a>. It also consumes <a href="cephalopod" title="wikilink">cephalopods</a> and <a href="crustacean" title="wikilink">crustaceans</a>, including <a href="Decapoda" title="wikilink">decapods</a> and <a href="isopod" title="wikilink">isopods</a>. Garbage has been recorded from the stomachs of some specimens.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Its known prey includes bottom-dwelling species such as the <a href="blackbelly_rosefish" title="wikilink">blackbelly rosefish</a> (<em>Helicolenus dactylopterus</em>), and midwater species such as the <a href="squid" class="uri" title="wikilink">squid</a> <em><a href="Teuthowenia_pellucida" title="wikilink">Teuthowenia pellucida</a></em> and the <a href="ostracod" class="uri" title="wikilink">ostracod</a> <em><a href="Macrocypridina_castanea_rotunda" title="wikilink">Macrocypridina castanea rotunda</a></em>. Thus, the goblin shark appears to forage for food both near the sea floor and far above it.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Since it is not a fast swimmer, the goblin shark may be an <a href="ambush_predator" title="wikilink">ambush predator</a>. Its low-density flesh and large <a href="shark_liver_oil" title="wikilink">oily</a> <a href="liver" class="uri" title="wikilink">liver</a> make it <a href="neutral_buoyancy" title="wikilink">neutrally buoyant</a>, allowing it to drift towards its prey with minimal motions so as to avoid detection.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Once prey comes into range, the shark's specialized jaws can snap forward at incredible speed to capture it. The protrusion of the jaw is assisted by two pairs of elastic <a href="ligament" title="wikilink">ligaments</a> associated with the <a href="mandible" title="wikilink">mandibular</a> joint. The ligaments are pulled taut when the jaws are in their normal retracted position; as the shark bites, the ligaments release their tension and essentially &quot;catapult&quot; the jaws forward.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> At the same time, the well-developed basihyal (analogous to a tongue) on the floor of the mouth shifts down, expanding the oral cavity and sucking in water and prey.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="life-history">Life history</h3>
<p>Little is known about goblin shark reproduction, as a pregnant female has yet to be found and studied. It likely shares the reproductive characteristics of other mackerel sharks, which are <a href="viviparous" class="uri" title="wikilink">viviparous</a> with small litter sizes and <a href="embryo" title="wikilink">embryos</a> that grow during <a href="gestation" class="uri" title="wikilink">gestation</a> by eating undeveloped <a href="ovum" title="wikilink">eggs</a> (<a href="oophagy" class="uri" title="wikilink">oophagy</a>).<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The birth size is probably close to , the length of the smallest known specimen.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Males <a href="mature_sexually" title="wikilink">mature sexually</a> at around  long, while female maturation size is unknown.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> No data are available on growth and aging.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="human-interactions">Human interactions</h2>
<p>Given the depths at which it lives, the goblin shark poses no danger to humans. A few specimens have been collected alive and brought to <a href="public_aquarium" title="wikilink">public aquariums</a>, though they survived only a short time. One was kept at <a href="Tokai_University" title="wikilink">Tokai University</a> and lived for a week, while another was kept at Tokyo Sea Life Park and lived for two days.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Its economic significance is minimal; the meat may be dried and salted, while the jaws fetch high prices from collectors.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> At one time, the Japanese also used it for liver oil and <a href="fertilizer" class="uri" title="wikilink">fertilizer</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> This shark is not targeted by any <a href="fisheries" class="uri" title="wikilink">fisheries</a>, but is occasionally found as <a href="bycatch" class="uri" title="wikilink">bycatch</a> in bottom <a href="gillnet" title="wikilink">gillnets</a> and <a href="trawl" title="wikilink">trawls</a>, hooked on <a href="longline_fishing" title="wikilink">longlines</a>, or entangled in fishing gear. Most captures are isolated incidents; one of the few areas where it is caught regularly is off southern Japan, where around thirty individuals (mostly juveniles) are taken each year. The <a href="black_scabbardfish" title="wikilink">black scabbardfish</a> (<em>Aphanops carbo</em>) fishery off Madeira also takes two or three goblin sharks annually. In April 2003, over a hundred goblin sharks were caught off northwestern Taiwan; the cause of the event was unknown, though observers noted that it was preceded by a major <a href="earthquake" class="uri" title="wikilink">earthquake</a>. The species had never been recorded in the area before, nor has it been found in such numbers since.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The <a href="International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="wikilink">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) has listed the goblin shark under <a href="Least_Concern" title="wikilink">Least Concern</a>. In addition to its wide range, most of its population is thought to reside in unfished environments because few adults are caught. Therefore, it is not believed to be threatened by human activity.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
