<p><strong>Quehanna Wild Area</strong> is a <a href="wildlife_area" title="wikilink">wildlife area</a> within parts of <a href="Cameron_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Cameron</a>, <a href="Clearfield_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Clearfield</a>, and <a href="Elk_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Elk</a> counties in the <a href="U.S._state" title="wikilink">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a>; with a total area of , it covers parts of <a href="Elk_State_Forest" title="wikilink">Elk</a> and <a href="Moshannon_State_Forest" title="wikilink">Moshannon State Forests</a>. Founded in the 1950s as a <a href="nuclear_physics" title="wikilink">nuclear research</a> center, Quehanna has a conflicting legacy of <a href="radioactivity" title="wikilink">radioactive</a> and <a href="toxic_waste" title="wikilink">toxic waste</a> contamination, while also being the largest <a href="List_of_Pennsylvania_state_forest_wild_areas" title="wikilink">state forest wild area</a> in Pennsylvania, with herds of native <a href="elk" class="uri" title="wikilink">elk</a>. The wild area is bisected by Pennsylvania Route 1011, the Quehanna Highway, and is home to <a href="second_growth_forest" title="wikilink">second growth forest</a> with mixed <a href="hardwood_forest" title="wikilink">hardwoods</a> and <a href="evergreen" title="wikilink">evergreens</a>. Quehanna has two state forest natural areas: the  <a href="Wykoff_Run_Natural_Area" title="wikilink">Wykoff Run Natural Area</a>, and the  <a href="Marion_Brooks_Natural_Area" title="wikilink">Marion Brooks Natural Area</a>. The latter has the largest stand of <a href="Betula_papyrifera" title="wikilink">white birch</a> in Pennsylvania and the eastern United States.</p>
<p>The land that became Quehanna Wild Area was home to <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native Americans</a>, including the <a href="Susquehannock" class="uri" title="wikilink">Susquehannock</a> and <a href="Iroquois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iroquois</a>, before it was purchased by the United States in 1784. Settlers soon moved into the region and, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the <a href="logging" class="uri" title="wikilink">logging</a> industry cut the <a href="virgin_forest" title="wikilink">virgin forests</a>; <a href="clearcutting" class="uri" title="wikilink">clearcutting</a> and forest fires transformed the once verdant land into the &quot;Pennsylvania Desert&quot;. Pennsylvania bought this land for its <a href="List_of_Pennsylvania_state_forests" title="wikilink">state forests</a> and in the 1930s the <a href="Civilian_Conservation_Corps" title="wikilink">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> worked to improve them. In 1955 the <a href="Curtiss-Wright" class="uri" title="wikilink">Curtiss-Wright</a> Corporation bought  of state forest for a research and manufacturing facility to focus on developing <a href="Jet_engine#Nuclear-powered_ramjet" title="wikilink">nuclear-powered jet engines</a>. They named their facility Quehanna for the nearby <a href="West_Branch_Susquehanna_River" title="wikilink">West Branch Susquehanna River</a>, itself named for the Susquehannocks.</p>
<p>Curtiss-Wright left in 1960, after which a succession of tenants further contaminated the nuclear reactor facility and its hot cells with radioactive isotopes, including <a href="strontium-90" class="uri" title="wikilink">strontium-90</a> and <a href="cobalt-60" class="uri" title="wikilink">cobalt-60</a>. The manufacture of radiation-treated hardwood flooring continued until 2002. Pennsylvania reacquired the land in 1963 and 1967, and in 1965 established Quehanna as a wild area, albeit one with a nuclear facility and industrial complex. The cleanup of the reactor and hot cells took over eight years and cost $30 million; the facility was demolished and its nuclear license terminated in 2009. Since 1992 the industrial complex has been home to Quehanna Motivational <a href="Boot_camp_(correctional)" title="wikilink">Boot Camp</a>, a minimum-security prison. Quehanna Wild Area has many sites where radioactive and toxic waste was buried, some of which have been cleaned up while others were dug up by <a href="American_Black_Bear" title="wikilink">black bear</a> and <a href="white-tailed_deer" title="wikilink">white-tailed deer</a>.</p>
<p>In 1970 the name was officially changed to Quehanna Wild Area, and later that decade the  <a href="Quehanna_Trail_System" title="wikilink">Quehanna Trail System</a> was built through the wild area and surrounding state forests. Primitive <a href="camping" class="uri" title="wikilink">camping</a> by hikers is allowed, but the area has no permanent residents. The trails are open to <a href="cross-country_skiing" title="wikilink">cross-country skiing</a> in the winter, but closed to vehicles. Quehanna is on the <a href="Allegheny_Plateau" title="wikilink">Allegheny Plateau</a> and was struck by a tornado in 1985. <a href="Defoliation" title="wikilink">Defoliating</a> insects have further damaged the forests. Quehanna Wild Area was named an <a href="Important_Bird_Area" title="wikilink">Important Bird Area</a> by the Pennsylvania <a href="Audubon_Society" title="wikilink">Audubon Society</a>, and is home to many species of birds and animals. <a href="Eco-tourism" title="wikilink">Eco-tourists</a> come to see the birds and elk, and hunters come for the elk, <a href="coyote" class="uri" title="wikilink">coyote</a>, and other game.</p>

<p>The <a href="Iroquoian_languages" title="wikilink">Iroquoian</a>-speaking <a href="Susquehannock" title="wikilink">Susquehannocks</a> were the earliest recorded inhabitants of the <a href="West_Branch_Susquehanna_River" title="wikilink">West Branch Susquehanna River</a> basin, which includes Quehanna Wild Area. They were a <a href="matriarchy" title="wikilink">matriarchal</a> society that lived in <a href="stockade" title="wikilink">stockaded</a> villages of large <a href="long_house" title="wikilink">long houses</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The Susquehannocks' numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the <a href="Iroquois" title="wikilink">Five Nations of the Iroquois</a>, and by 1675 they had died out, moved away, or been <a href="cultural_assimilation" title="wikilink">assimilated</a> into other tribes.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> After this, the Iroquois exercised nominal control of the lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley. They also lived in long houses, primarily in what is now <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, and had a strong <a href="confederation" title="wikilink">confederacy</a> which gave them power beyond their numbers. To fill the void left by the demise of the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged such displaced eastern tribes as the <a href="Shawnee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shawnee</a> and <a href="Lenape" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lenape</a> (or Delaware) to settle in the West Branch watershed.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Seneca_nation" title="wikilink">Seneca</a> tribe of the Iroquois hunted in much of Pennsylvania and the Quehanna area.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The Iroquois and other tribes used the <a href="Great_Shamokin_Path" title="wikilink">Great Shamokin Path</a>, the major native east&lt;U+2013&gt;west path connecting the Susquehanna and <a href="Allegheny_River" title="wikilink">Allegheny River</a> basins, which passed south of what is now the wild area. The native village of Chinklacamoose (or Chingleclamouche) was on this path at the West Branch Susquehanna River, at what is now <a href="Clearfield,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Clearfield</a> to the southwest of Quehanna. The <a href="Sinnemahoning_Path" title="wikilink">Sinnemahoning Path</a> along <a href="Sinnemahoning_Creek" title="wikilink">Sinnemahoning Creek</a> ran north of Quehanna; as the path with the gentlest grade, it may have been the route the first <a href="Paleo-Indians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paleo-Indians</a> took entering this part of Pennsylvania from the west.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="French_and_Indian_War" title="wikilink">French and Indian War</a> (1754&lt;U+2013&gt;1763) and the subsequent colonial expansion encouraged the migration of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin. In October 1784, the United States acquired a large tract of land, including what is now Quehanna Wild Area, from the Iroquois in the <a href="Treaty_of_Fort_Stanwix_(1784)" title="wikilink">Second Treaty of Fort Stanwix</a>; this acquisition is known as the Last Purchase in Pennsylvania.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Although most of the Native Americans left this area of Pennsylvania, the state's Native American heritage can be found in many of its place names. The Susquehannocks were also known as the Susquehanna, from which the <a href="Susquehanna_River" title="wikilink">Susquehanna River</a> and its West Branch obtained their names.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In the 1950s the <a href="Curtiss-Wright" class="uri" title="wikilink">Curtiss-Wright</a> Corporation coined the name &quot;Quehanna&quot; for its nuclear reservation, which it derived from the last three syllables of &quot;Susquehanna&quot;,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> &quot;in honor of the river that drained the entire region&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Part of Quehanna Wild Area lies in the Moshannon State Forest, named for <a href="Moshannon_Creek" title="wikilink">Moshannon Creek</a>, which means &quot;moose stream&quot; or &quot;elk stream&quot; in the <a href="Lenape_language" title="wikilink">Lenape language</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Sinnemahoning Creek's name means &quot;stony <a href="salt_lick" title="wikilink">salt lick</a>&quot; in Lenape.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>Prior to the arrival of <a href="William_Penn" title="wikilink">William Penn</a> and his <a href="Religious_Society_of_Friends" title="wikilink">Quaker</a> colonists in 1682, forests covered up to 90 percent of what is now Pennsylvania: more than  of <a href="eastern_white_pine" title="wikilink">eastern white pine</a>, <a href="Tsuga_canadensis" title="wikilink">eastern hemlock</a>, and a mix of <a href="hardwood" title="wikilink">hardwoods</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Scull's 1770 map of the <a href="Province_of_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Province of Pennsylvania</a> showed the colonists' ignorance of the land north of the West Branch Susquehanna River; Sinnemahoning Creek was missing and the region that includes Quehanna was labeled &quot;Buffaloe Swamp&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> This began to change when the land was purchased from the Iroquois in 1784, and became part of <a href="Northumberland_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Northumberland County</a>.

Chingleclamouche Township was included in <a href="Clearfield_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Clearfield County</a> when it was established in 1804.

<p>The first <a href="European_American" title="wikilink">European American</a> settlers arrived in Chingleclamouche Township in about 1793, and the first sawmill in Clearfield County began operating in 1805. Settlers initially occupied land along the river and creeks, as these provided a means of transportation. Some settlers would harvest timber and float it downstream once a year to make money for items they could not produce themselves, but by 1820 the first full-time lumbering operations began in the region. The white pine was the most sought after tree, yielding <a href="spar" title="wikilink">spars</a> for ships and timber for buildings. Hardwoods were also harvested, and eventually hemlocks were cut for their wood and their bark, which contained <a href="tannin" title="wikilink">tannins</a> used in <a href="tanning" class="uri" title="wikilink">tanning</a> leather.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

This permitted their use to float logs to sawmills and markets. <a href="Log_boom" title="wikilink">Log booms</a> were placed on the West Branch Susquehanna River to catch the floating timber; <a href="Lock_Haven,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Lock Haven</a> built a boom in 1849, and <a href="Williamsport,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Williamsport</a>'s <a href="Susquehanna_Boom" title="wikilink">Susquehanna Boom</a> opened in 1851.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Businesses purchased vast tracts of land and built <a href="splash_dam" title="wikilink">splash dams</a> on the creeks; these dams controlled water in small streams that would otherwise be unable to carry logs and rafts. For example, in 1871 a single splash dam on the <a href="Sinnemahoning_Creek#Bennett_Branch_Sinnemahoning_Creek_and_tributaries" title="wikilink">Bennett Branch of Sinnemahoning Creek</a> could release enough water to produce a wave  high on the <a href="main_stem" title="wikilink">main stem</a> for two hours. <a href="Mosquito_Creek_(Pennsylvania)" title="wikilink">Mosquito Creek</a>, which drains much of the southern part of Quehanna Wild Area, had at least nine splash dams in its watershed.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> This was the predominant lumber transport system in the Quehanna region from 1865 to 1885 and after 1850, five different kinds of lumber rafts could be found on its streams and river.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Much of the timber was too remote to be transported via the streams, and logging <a href="railroad" title="wikilink">railroads</a> were the next development in the Quehanna lumber era. In or around 1880, these railroads allowed the <a href="clearcutting" class="uri" title="wikilink">clearcutting</a> of the remaining forests. The Quehanna plateau was unusual in using <a href="standard_gauge" title="wikilink">standard gauge</a> track for its logging railroads: most such railways were <a href="narrow_gauge" title="wikilink">narrow gauge</a>. The logging railroads used special <a href="geared_steam_locomotive" title="wikilink">geared steam locomotives</a>, such as the <a href="Shay_locomotive" title="wikilink">Shay</a>, <a href="Climax_locomotive" title="wikilink">Climax</a> and <a href="Heisler_locomotive" title="wikilink">Heisler</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Nine companies operated logging railroads in what became Moshannon State Forest; the Goodyear Lumber Company was the largest and cut much of what became Quehanna Wild Area between 1902 and 1912.

<p><img src="Pennsylvania_Desert_3.jpg" title="fig:Clearcutting led to the &quot;Pennsylvania Desert&quot;" alt="Clearcutting led to the &quot;Pennsylvania Desert&quot;" /> There were only two major roads on the Quehanna plateau in the 19th and early 20th centuries, both originally <a href="Toll_road" title="wikilink">turnpikes</a>. The Caledonia Pike ran east&lt;U+2013&gt;west from <a href="Bellefonte,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Bellefonte</a> to <a href="Smethport,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Smethport</a>, and passed south of what became the wild area, while the Driftwood Pike ran from near Karthaus north to <a href="Driftwood,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Driftwood</a> on the Sinnemahoning, and passed through the wild area.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> <a href="Wagon_train" title="wikilink">Wagon trains</a> and railroads brought supplies to the lumber camps in the woods; some <a href="lumberjack" title="wikilink">wood hicks</a> set up small farms on cleared land that also provided food.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> There were at least eight farms in Quehanna, though they were not very productive because of &quot;poorly drained acid soil and a short growing season&quot;.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>The lumber era in Quehanna did not last; the <a href="old-growth_forest" title="wikilink">old-growth</a> and <a href="secondary_forest" title="wikilink">second-growth forests</a> were clearcut by the early 20th century. Fire had always been a hazard; the sparks from logging steam engines started many wildfires, and more wood may have been lost to fires than to logging in some areas. On the clearcut land nothing remained except the discarded, dried-out tree tops, which were very flammable; much of the land burned and was left barren. The soil was depleted of nutrients, fires baked the ground hard, and jungles of blueberries, blackberries, and mountain laurel covered the clearcut land, which became known as the &quot;Pennsylvania Desert&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> </p>

They called for a change in the philosophy of forest management and for the state to purchase land from the lumber companies. In 1895, Rothrock was appointed the first forestry commissioner in what became the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's <a href="Pennsylvania_Department_of_Conservation_and_Natural_Resources" title="wikilink">Department of Conservation and Natural Resources</a> (DCNR). In 1897, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation that authorized the purchase of &quot;unseated lands for forest reservations&quot; and the first of the <a href="List_of_Pennsylvania_state_forests" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania state forest lands</a> were acquired the following year.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

The young men of the CCC planted trees, blazed new trails, built roads and bridges, and fought fires, which continued to be a problem. In 1938 a fast-moving fire in the Elk State Forest, north of Quehanna, killed eight firefighters.

<p>In 1946 the Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association was founded to promote conservation in the region. One of the Association's initial concerns was the acidification of streams, which they originally attributed to <a href="tannic_acid" title="wikilink">tannic acid</a> from the trees used by the beavers to construct their <a href="beaver_dam" title="wikilink">dams</a>. With the assistance of Pennsylvania's Department of Forests and Waters, Game Commission, and <a href="Pennsylvania_Fish_and_Boat_Commission" title="wikilink">Fish and Boat Commission</a>, they dynamited 79 dams.

<p>The state constructed $1.6 million of roads to the area; the Quehanna Highway was built on parts of an old CCC road, which followed an earlier logging railroad grade. Pennsylvania also canceled 212 camp site leases to help ensure security for the installation. Curtiss-Wright built three facilities on its land. The first was a nuclear research center with a <a href="nuclear_reactor" title="wikilink">nuclear reactor</a> and six <a href="Radiation_shield" title="wikilink">shielded</a> <a href="nuclear_radiation" title="wikilink">radiation</a> <a href="Containment_building" title="wikilink">containment</a> chambers for handling radioactive isotopes, referred to as <a href="hot_cell" title="wikilink">hot cells</a>, at the end of Reactor Road. The second was for <a href="jet_engine" title="wikilink">jet engine</a> trials and had two test cells with bunkers just north of Quehanna Highway, about  apart. The northern test cell was at the center of the 16-sided polygon; even if a jet engine broke its moorings, it could not leave the polygonal area. Both of these were on the land which Curtiss-Wright had purchased, which was a regular <a href="octagon" class="uri" title="wikilink">octagon</a> surrounded with a  fence built by forest rangers, supervised from three guard houses on Quehanna Highway and Wykoff Run Road. The third installation was an industrial complex at the southeast edge of the polygon, in Karthaus Township, on the Quehanna Highway. At this site, a Curtiss-Wright division manufactured Curon foam for furniture and household products and used <a href="beryllium_oxide" title="wikilink">beryllium oxide</a> to make high-temperature <a href="ceramic" title="wikilink">ceramics</a> for application in the nuclear industry.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

On July 12, 1963, Pennsylvania Governor <a href="William_Scranton" title="wikilink">William Scranton</a> announced the termination of Curtiss-Wright's lease on ; the state paid the company for the roads it had built, and Curtiss-Wright donated six of the eight buildings in the industrial complex to the state.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> In 1965 the state legislature passed an act declaring the former leased area a <a href="wilderness_area" title="wikilink">wilderness area</a>,<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> and <a href="Maurice_K._Goddard" title="wikilink">Maurice K.

<p>In 1967, Pennsylvania leased the reactor complex to the <a href="The_Apollo_Affair" title="wikilink">Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation</a> (NUMEC), which already had a federal license to work with nuclear materials. NUMEC, which soon became a subsidiary of <a href="ARCO" title="wikilink">Atlantic-Richfield Corporation</a> (ARCO), set up a large irradiator in what had been the reactor pool. The irradiator contained over 1 million curies of <a href="cobalt-60" class="uri" title="wikilink">cobalt-60</a> to produce intense <a href="gamma_ray" title="wikilink">gamma rays</a>, which were used to sterilize medical equipment and irradiate food and wood. In the spring of 1967 the state had concluded that radiation contamination at the Quehanna site &quot;could never be completely cleaned up&quot;, and so was glad to find a tenant with nuclear experience.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a><a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="2-Grinder_Use_Test_Cut.jpg" title="fig:The robot which disassembled the most contaminated parts of the facility in action" alt="The robot which disassembled the most contaminated parts of the facility in action" /> A group of NUMEC employees discovered that irradiating hardwood treated with plastics produced very durable flooring. In 1978 they formed PermaGrain Products, Inc. as a separate company from ARCO, and purchased the rights to the process as well as &quot;the main irradiator, a smaller shielded irradiator and related equipment&quot;.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> PermaGrain sold the flooring for use in <a href="basketball_court" title="wikilink">basketball courts</a> and gymnasiums, and was the longest occupant of the Quehanna facility, operating there from 1978 to December 2002. PermaGrain also let Neutron Products, Inc., a Maryland company, do cobalt-60 work in its hot cells, which required an amendment of their license from the <a href="Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission" title="wikilink">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a> (NRC, the successor to the AEC).<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a><a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a><a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1993, strontium-90 contamination in the reactor facility led the NRC to require PermaGrain to begin decontamination work, and the Pennsylvania DEP commissioned a &quot;site characterization study&quot;.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> In 1998, a firm named NES began the cleanup work; they changed their name to Scientech in 1999 and to <a href="EnergySolutions" class="uri" title="wikilink">EnergySolutions</a> in 2006. The cleanup was originally estimated to take six months; by 2006 it had taken 8 years and cost $30 million. According to the <a href="Pennsylvania_Department_of_Environmental_Protection" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection</a>'s (DEP) Bureau of Radiation Protection: &quot;Inadequate characterization of the site and the presence of ongoing industrial operations resulted in many project delays and increased costs.&quot;<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> The hot cells proved to have more radioactive sources than originally thought. In October 1978 a Scientech worker doing decontamination cut a tube in hot cell number 4, which accidentally released strontium-90 into PermaGrain's work area. As a result, a robot had to be constructed to remove 3,000 curies of cobalt-60 in two of the hot cells, dismantle cell 4, and decontaminate the rest remotely.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>

The DCNR made the policy decision that Quehanna Wild Area would be closed to industrial uses. After looking at multiple sites with Clearfield County development authorities, a new site for PermaGrain Products was purchased, and the company submitted its plans for a new building and license to the NRC in October 2001. In order to approve the move to the new site, the NRC required PermaGrain to provide an inventory of all their cobalt-60 sources, dispose of a damaged source, and dispose of any other sources not mechanically certified. However in late December 2002, PermaGrain filed for bankruptcy under <a href="Chapter_7,_Title_11,_United_States_Code" title="wikilink">Chapter Seven</a>.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> PermaGrain had employed 135 people in 1988 and 80 in 1995.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p>When PermaGrain went bankrupt, about 100,000 curies of cobalt-60 were abandoned at the reactor facility, which was now under the control of Pennsylvania's government. The DEP assumed responsibility for the NRC license and legacy contamination. The <a href="United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="wikilink">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a>, working with the NRC and state, removed the cobalt-60 from the site for disposal at the <a href="Low_level_waste" title="wikilink">low-level radioactive waste</a> facility in <a href="Barnwell,_South_Carolina" title="wikilink">Barnwell, South Carolina</a>, in September 2003. Scientech continued decontamination work and demolished the hot cells; much of this work was done robotically, with financial aid from the <a href="United_States_Department_of_Energy" title="wikilink">United States Department of Energy</a>.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a><a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>The cleanup was thought finished, so a final survey was done in December 2004, and a Final Status Survey Report was filed in February 2005. However, when the NRC and scientists from the <a href="Oak_Ridge_Institute_for_Science_and_Education" title="wikilink">Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education</a> surveyed the facility in May 2005, they found many areas of contamination above the legal limits. According to the NRC's Quehanna Site Status Summary, strontium-90 had contaminated the &quot;buildings as well as ... surface and subsurface soil&quot; but was not in groundwater.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> More cleanup work was done in the summer of 2005, but the site still did not meet NRC regulations.

The new plan called for demolition of the building without completing decontamination, and disposal of the above ground material in a regular <a href="landfill" class="uri" title="wikilink">landfill</a>. This plan was approved by the NRC in October 2006, and a December 2006 survey showed &quot;that the above grade structure met the release limits&quot; of the disposal plan.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a><a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a><a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> The former reactor structure was demolished and on May 13, 2009 the NRC released the state from its license for the site.

Others told about burying hundreds of drums of unknown waste from the reactor facility and digging a trench  and  deep for waste drums north of Wykoff Run Road. The locations of some sites, which included radioactive waste, beryllium oxide, and other toxic compounds, were not recorded.

<p>The <a href="virgin_forest" title="wikilink">virgin forests</a> of what became Quehanna Wild Area were different in composition and quality than those of today. Eastern white pine and eastern hemlock were more common, often found on shady slopes and damp areas on plateaus. <a href="Quercus_prinus" title="wikilink">Chestnut oak</a> and <a href="pitch_pine" title="wikilink">pitch pine</a> favored slopes that were sandy or rocky, and the forest had a mixture of hardwoods, including <a href="Fraxinus" title="wikilink">ash</a>, <a href="beech" class="uri" title="wikilink">beech</a>, <a href="birch" class="uri" title="wikilink">birch</a>, <a href="chestnut" class="uri" title="wikilink">chestnut</a>, <a href="maple" class="uri" title="wikilink">maple</a>, and <a href="yellow_poplar" title="wikilink">yellow poplar</a>.

Centuries of accumulated organic matter in the forest soil caused slow percolation of rainfall into the streams, so they flowed more evenly year-round.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Quehanna_Wild_Area_Warmth.jpg" title="fig:Second-growth trees in Moshannon State Forest" alt="Second-growth trees in Moshannon State Forest" /> The clearcutting and repeated fires changed all of this. New growth was often composed of different plants and trees than had originally been there. Near Beaver Run in Quehanna there are wetlands that were originally hemlock forest. Hemlocks <a href="transpiration" title="wikilink">transpire</a> large amounts of water and once they were gone the soil was too wet to support most trees; the <a href="bracken" class="uri" title="wikilink">bracken</a> and <a href="fern" title="wikilink">ferns</a> that replaced the hemlocks altered the soil qualities to discourage trees as well.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> Within the Quehanna Wild Area  are <a href="wetland" title="wikilink">wetlands</a>.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> Fires and erosion removed nutrients from the soil, and in some areas the soil was so poor in nutrients that only white birch, a <a href="pioneer_species" title="wikilink">pioneer species</a>, would grow there.

<p>Besides forest fires and tornado damage, there have been other threats to Quehanna's forests in the 20th century. Many trees were lost when <a href="chestnut_blight" title="wikilink">chestnut blight</a> wiped out the <a href="American_chestnut" title="wikilink">American chestnut</a> trees by 1925; in the Quehanna area, this species constituted between one-quarter and one-half of the hardwoods.

A similar pest, <a href="Croesia_semipurpurana" title="wikilink">oak leaf tier</a>, stripped  of oaks in Elk State Forest by 1970.

<p>Some animals, previously present in abundance, have disappeared, or the populations declined, through habitat loss. By 1912, after the forests had been clearcut, Quehanna was covered by &quot;vast expanses of brush, created when the root systems of cut-off trees sprouted up through the discarded tops and limbs of the logged forest&quot;.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> Once the forest fires were controlled, this <a href="Shrubland" title="wikilink">brush</a> offered habitat for many game species.

By the early 21st century, many of the trees in Quehanna were 80 to 100 years old, and the maturation of the forests led to the disappearance of species like <a href="bobwhite_quail" title="wikilink">bobwhite quail</a>, <a href="Common_pheasant" title="wikilink">ring-necked pheasant</a>, and <a href="snowshoe_hare" title="wikilink">snowshoe hare</a>, while white-tailed deer, <a href="ruffed_grouse" title="wikilink">ruffed grouse</a>, <a href="black_squirrel" title="wikilink">black squirrel</a>, and <a href="cottontail_rabbit" title="wikilink">cottontail rabbit</a> all became less common than they had been. Efforts by the Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association (MCSA) to reintroduce bobwhite quail, ring-necked pheasant, and snowshoe hare have been unsuccessful.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a><a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a></p>
<p>Other animals became <a href="Local_extinction" title="wikilink">locally extinct</a> through overhunting. The last elk in Pennsylvania was killed in Elk County in 1867. The Pennsylvania Game Commission brought 177 animals from the <a href="Rocky_Mountains" title="wikilink">Rocky Mountains</a> to the state from 1913 to 1926; today the elk herd of over 600 animals can often be seen in Quehanna Wild Area.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> Between 1906 and 1925, Pennsylvania became so concerned about declining numbers of white-tailed deer that it imported nearly 1,200 animals from <a href="Michigan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Michigan</a> to re-establish the species, and made it the official state animal in 1959.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> In the early 21st century, over-grazing by deer threatens plant diversity.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> By the early 1900s, the <a href="Fisher_(animal)" title="wikilink">fisher</a>, a small mammal similar to the <a href="European_polecat" title="wikilink">European polecat</a> or <a href="American_marten" title="wikilink">American marten</a>, was hunted to extinction in Pennsylvania. Between 1994 and 1998, 190 animals were released in five sites in the northern part of the state, including 23 animals along Quehanna's Wykoff Run in 1995.

The main <a href="trailhead" class="uri" title="wikilink">trailhead</a> for most hikers is at <a href="Parker_Dam_State_Park" title="wikilink">Parker Dam State Park</a> to the west of the wild area. From there the trail, which is <a href="Trail_blazing" title="wikilink">blazed</a> in orange, heads east to the southern part of Quehanna Wild Area, skirts Piper and the Boot Camp there, then turns north, crosses Wykoff Run and turns west again. After passing through Marion Brooks Natural Area, the trail leaves the wild area and completes the loop back at Parker Dam. The Quehanna Trail is considered a strenuous hike not just because of its length, but for its  of changes in elevation. Two blue-blazed connector trails add  to the system, and there are many side trails and small trails off the Quehanna Highway. Most trails are open to <a href="cross-country_skiing" title="wikilink">cross-country skiing</a> in the winter. According to the DCNR, the Quehanna Trail &quot;passes through some of the most wild and beautiful country Pennsylvania has to offer&quot;.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a><a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a><a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a><a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a></p>
<p>Susan Stranahan's <em>Susquehanna: River of Dreams</em> reports that before Curtiss-Wright took over the area in 1955, Quehanna was considered &quot;some of the best hunting land in the state&quot;.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a> While no hunting or fishing were initially allowed on the leased land, by July 1959 fishing on Mosquito Creek was allowed again, as was limited hunting to help control the deer. In October 1963 hunting resumed throughout the wild area, four years before the state purchased the land back from Curtiss-Wright.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> As of 2010, the Pennsylvania Game Commission allows hunting of the following species found in Quehanna Wild Area: American crow, beaver, black bear, black squirrel, bobcat, bobwhite quail, cottontail rabbit, <a href="coyote" class="uri" title="wikilink">coyote</a>, elk, house sparrow, <a href="raccoon" class="uri" title="wikilink">raccoon</a>, red fox, ring-necked pheasant, ruffed grouse, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and woodcock.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> The Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association has sponsored an annual coyote hunt each winter hunt since 1992.

Fishing is primarily for trout.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a></p>
<p>The Quehanna Wild Area is also seen, used, and enjoyed by <a href="bird_watcher" title="wikilink">bird watchers</a> attracted by its status as an Important Bird Area.
