<p>The <strong>Eastern Moa</strong>, <em>Emeus crassus</em>, is an <a href="Extinction" title="wikilink">extinct</a> species of <a href="ratite" class="uri" title="wikilink">ratite</a> bird belonging to the <a href="moa" class="uri" title="wikilink">moa</a> family. It is nowadays recognized as the only species of the <a href="genus" class="uri" title="wikilink">genus</a> <em>Emeus</em>.</p>
<p><em>Emeus</em> was of average size, standing 1.5-1.8 m (5 ft) tall. Like other moa, it had vestigial <a href="wing" class="uri" title="wikilink">wing</a> bones, <a href="hair" class="uri" title="wikilink">hair</a>-like <a href="feathers" class="uri" title="wikilink">feathers</a> (beige in this case), a long neck and large, powerful legs with very short, strong tarsi. Its feet were exceptionally wide compared to other moas, making it a very slow creature. Soft parts of its body, such as tracheal rings (cartilage) or remnants of skin were found, as well as single bones and complete skeletongs. As they neared the head, the feathers grew shorter, until they finally turned into coarse hair; the head itself was probably bald.</p>
<p><a href="Human" class="uri" title="wikilink">Human</a> colonists hunted <em>Emeus</em> into extinction with relative ease. Like almost all moa, it was gone by the year <a href="1500" class="uri" title="wikilink">1500</a>.</p>
<p>It has been long suspected that the &quot;species&quot; described as <em>Emeus huttonii</em> and <em>E. crassus</em> were males and females, respectively, of a single species. This has been confirmed by analysis for sex-specific genetic markers of DNA extracted from bone material; the females of <em>E. crassus</em> were 15-25% larger than males (Huynen <em>et al</em>., 2003). This phenomenon &lt;U+2014&gt; reverse size dimorphism &lt;U+2014&gt; is not uncommon amongst ratites, being also very pronounced in <a href="kiwi" title="wikilink">kiwis</a>.</p>
