<p>The OWWR had come under the control of the GWR by this time, and so the GWR constructed a link from Smethwick to <a href="Handsworth,_West_Midlands" title="wikilink">Handsworth</a>, which was opened at the same time, to connect it to the GWR's <a href="Birmingham_Snow_Hill_to_Wolverhampton_Low_Level_Line" title="wikilink">Birmingham Snow Hill to Wolverhampton Low Level Line</a>. The running of the line was also taken over by the GWR.</p>
