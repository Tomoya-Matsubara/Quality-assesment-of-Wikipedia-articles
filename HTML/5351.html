<p><strong>Vancouver</strong> (<a href="International_Phonetic_Alphabet" title="wikilink">pronounced</a>: ) is a city in south-western <a href="British_Columbia" title="wikilink">British Columbia</a>, <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>. The city is named after Captain <a href="George_Vancouver" title="wikilink">George Vancouver</a>, an <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> explorer. The City of Vancouver has a population of 587,891<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, while its metropolitan region, the <a href="Greater_Vancouver_Regional_District" title="wikilink">Greater Vancouver Regional District</a> has a population of 2,180,737 (2006 estimate)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.

<p>Vancouver is located between the <a href="Strait_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">Strait of Georgia</a> and the <a href="Coast_Mountains" title="wikilink">Coast Mountains</a>. <a href="Economy_of_Vancouver" title="wikilink">Its economy</a> has traditionally relied on British Columbia's resource sectors: <a href="forestry" class="uri" title="wikilink">forestry</a>, <a href="mining" class="uri" title="wikilink">mining</a>, <a href="fishing" class="uri" title="wikilink">fishing</a> and <a href="Agriculture_in_Canada" title="wikilink">agriculture</a>. It was first settled in the 1860s as a result of <a href="Immigration_to_Canada" title="wikilink">immigration</a> caused by the <a href="Fraser_Canyon_Gold_Rush" title="wikilink">Fraser Canyon Gold Rush</a>, and developed rapidly from a small <a href="sawmill" title="wikilink">lumber mill</a> town into a metropolitan centre following the arrival of the <a href="Canadian_Pacific_Railway" title="wikilink">transcontinental railway</a> in 1887. The <a href="Port_of_Vancouver" title="wikilink">Port of Vancouver</a> became internationally significant after the completion of the <a href="Panama_Canal" title="wikilink">Panama Canal</a>, which reduced freight rates in the 1920s and made it viable to ship export-bound <a href="Canadian_Prairies" title="wikilink">prairie grain</a> west through Vancouver.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> It has since become the busiest seaport in Canada, and exports more cargo than any other port in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The economy of Vancouver has diversified over time, however.

<p>The explorer and <a href="North_West_Company" title="wikilink">North West Company</a> trader <a href="Simon_Fraser_(explorer)" title="wikilink">Simon Fraser</a> and his crew were the first Europeans known to have set foot on the site of the present-day city. In 1808, they descended the <a href="Fraser_River" title="wikilink">Fraser River</a> perhaps as far as Point Grey, near the <a href="University_of_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">University of British Columbia</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Cariboo_Gold_Rush" title="wikilink">Cariboo Gold Rush</a> of 1861 brought 25,000 men, mainly from <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>, to the mouth of the Fraser River and what would become Vancouver.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The first European settlement was established in 1862 at McLeery's Farm on the Fraser River, just east of the ancient village of <a href="Musqueam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Musqueam</a> in what is now <a href="Marpole" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marpole</a>. A sawmill established at Moodyville (now the <a href="North_Vancouver,_British_Columbia_(city)" title="wikilink">City of North Vancouver</a>) in 1863 began the city's long relationship with <a href="logging" title="wikilink">lumbering</a>, and was quickly followed by mills on the south shore of the inlet owned by Captain Edward Stamp. Stamp, who had begun lumbering in the <a href="Port_Alberni,_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">Port Alberni</a> area, first attempted to run a mill at <a href="Brockton_Point" title="wikilink">Brockton Point</a>, but difficult currents and reefs forced the relocation of the operation to a point near the foot of Gore Street, known as <a href="Hastings_Mill" title="wikilink">Hastings Mill</a>. The mill formed the nucleus around which Vancouver formed. The mill's central role in the city waned after the arrival of the <a href="Canadian_Pacific_Railway" title="wikilink">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> (CPR) in the 1880s, but it nonetheless remained important to the local economy until it closed in the 1920s.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Vancouver is among British Columbia's youngest cities.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The settlement of <a href="Gastown" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gastown</a> grew up quickly around the original makeshift <a href="tavern" class="uri" title="wikilink">tavern</a> established by &lt;U+201C&gt;Gassy&lt;U+201D&gt; <a href="John_Deighton" title="wikilink">Jack Deighton</a> in 1867 on the edge of the Hastings Mill property.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In 1870, the <a href="Colony_of_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">colonial government</a> surveyed the settlement and laid out a townsite, renamed &lt;U+201C&gt;Granville,&lt;U+201D&gt; in honour of the then British <a href="Secretary_of_State_for_the_Colonies" title="wikilink">Secretary of State for the Colonies</a>, <a href="Granville_Leveson-Gower,_2nd_Earl_Granville" title="wikilink">Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville</a>. This site, with its natural harbour, was eventually selected as the terminus for the Canadian Pacific Railway to the disappointment of <a href="Port_Moody,_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">Port Moody</a>, <a href="New_Westminster,_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">New Westminster</a> and <a href="Victoria,_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">Victoria</a>, all of which had vied to be the railhead. The building of the railway was among the preconditions for British Columbia joining <a href="Canadian_Confederation" title="wikilink">Confederation</a> in 1871.</p>
<p>The City of Vancouver was incorporated on <a href="6_April" title="wikilink">6 April</a> <a href="1886" class="uri" title="wikilink">1886</a>, the same year that the first transcontinental train arrived. The name, honouring George Vancouver, was chosen by CPR president <a href="William_Van_Horne" title="wikilink">William Van Horne</a>, who arrived in Port Moody to establish the CPR terminus recommended by <a href="Henry_John_Cambie" title="wikilink">Henry John Cambie</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> A massive &quot;slash burn&quot; (clearing fire) broke out on <a href="13_June" title="wikilink">13 June</a> <a href="1886" class="uri" title="wikilink">1886</a>, razing the entire city. It was quickly rebuilt, and the <a href="Vancouver_Fire_and_Rescue_Services" title="wikilink">Vancouver Fire Department</a> was established that same year.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> From a settlement of 1,000 people in 1881, Vancouver's population grew to over 20,000 by the turn of the century and 100,000 by 1911.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>During the 1898 <a href="Klondike_Gold_Rush" title="wikilink">Klondike Gold Rush</a>, Vancouver merchants sold a great deal of equipment to prospectors.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> One of those merchants, Charles Woodward, had opened the first <a href="Woodward&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Woodward's</a> store at what is now Georgia and Main Streets in 1892 and, along with <a href="Spencer&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spencer's</a> and the <a href="Hudson&#39;s_Bay_Company" title="wikilink">Hudson's Bay Company</a> department stores, formed the dominant core of the city's retail sector for decades.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>The economy of early Vancouver was dominated by large companies such as the CPR, which had the capital needed for the rapid development of the new city. Some manufacturing did develop, but the resource sector was the backbone of Vancouver's economy, initially with logging, and later with exports moved through the <a href="Port_of_Vancouver" title="wikilink">seaport</a>, where commercial traffic constituted the largest economic sector in Vancouver by the 1930s.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> <img src="1898_Van_Pan_Map.jpg" title="fig:Aerial panorama of Vancouver, 1898" alt="Aerial panorama of Vancouver, 1898" width="335" /></p>
<p>The dominance of the economy by big business was accompanied by an often militant <a href="Trades_and_Labour_Congress_of_Canada" title="wikilink">labour movement</a>. The first major sympathy <a href="strike_action" title="wikilink">strike</a> was in 1903 when railway employees struck against the CPR for union recognition. Labour leader Frank Rogers was killed while picketing at the docks by CPR police during that strike, becoming the British Columbia movement's first martyr.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Canada's first general strike occurred following the death of another labour leader, <a href="Albert_Goodwin" title="wikilink">Ginger Goodwin</a>, in 1918, at the <a href="Cumberland,_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">Cumberland</a> coal mines on <a href="Vancouver_Island" title="wikilink">Vancouver Island</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> A lull in industrial tensions through the later 1920s came to an abrupt end with the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a>. Most of the 1930s strikes were led by <a href="Communist_Party_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Communist Party</a> organizers.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> That strike wave peaked in 1935 when unemployed men flooded the city to protest conditions in the relief camps run by the military in remote areas throughout the province. After two tense months of daily and disruptive protesting, the <a href="Relief_Camp_Workers&#39;_Union" title="wikilink">relief camp strikers</a> decided to take their grievances to the federal government and embarked on the <a href="On-to-Ottawa_Trek" title="wikilink">On-to-Ottawa Trek</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Other social movements, such as the <a href="first-wave_feminism" title="wikilink">first-wave feminist</a>, moral reform, and <a href="temperance_movement" title="wikilink">temperance movements</a> were also influential in Vancouver's development. <a href="Mary_Ellen_Smith" title="wikilink">Mary Ellen Smith</a>, a Vancouver <a href="women&#39;s_suffrage" title="wikilink">suffragist</a> and <a href="Prohibition_in_Canada" title="wikilink">prohibitionist</a>, became the first woman elected to a <a href="Legislative_Assemblies_of_Canadian_provinces_and_territories" title="wikilink">provincial legislature</a> in Canada in 1918.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Alcohol prohibition began in the <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">First World War</a> and lasted until 1921, when the provincial government established its control over alcohol sales, which still persists today.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Canada's first <a href="prohibition_(drugs)" title="wikilink">drug law</a> came about following an inquiry conducted by the federal <a href="Minister_of_Labour_(Canada)" title="wikilink">Minister of Labour</a> and future <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="William_Lyon_Mackenzie_King" title="wikilink">William Lyon Mackenzie King</a>. King was sent to investigate damages claims resulting from a riot when the <a href="Asiatic_Exclusion_League" title="wikilink">Asiatic Exclusion League</a> led a rampage through <a href="Chinatown_(Vancouver)" title="wikilink">Chinatown</a> and <a href="Japantown_(Vancouver)" title="wikilink">Japantown</a>. Two of the claimants were <a href="opium" class="uri" title="wikilink">opium</a> manufacturers, and after further investigation, King found that white women were reportedly frequenting <a href="opium_den" title="wikilink">opium dens</a> as well as <a href="Chinese_Canadian" title="wikilink">Chinese</a> men. A federal law banning the manufacture, sale, and importation of opium for non-medicinal purposes was soon passed based on these revelations.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Amalgamation_(politics)" title="wikilink">Amalgamation</a> with Point Grey and South Vancouver gave the city its final contours not long before taking its place as the third largest metropolis in the country. As of <a href="1_January" title="wikilink">1 January</a> <a href="1929" class="uri" title="wikilink">1929</a>, the population of the enlarged Vancouver was 228,193 and it filled the entire peninsula between the <a href="Burrard_Inlet" title="wikilink">Burrard Inlet</a> and the Fraser River.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>


<p>The original vegetation of most of Vancouver and its suburbs was dense <a href="temperate_rain_forest" title="wikilink">temperate rain forest</a>, consisting of <a href="conifer" title="wikilink">conifers</a> with scattered pockets of <a href="maple" class="uri" title="wikilink">maple</a> and <a href="alder" class="uri" title="wikilink">alder</a>, as well as large areas of <a href="swamp" title="wikilink">swampland</a> (even in upland areas, due to poor drainage).<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> <img src="vanc_scenery2006.jpg" title="fig:Stanley Park and a Downtown residential area" alt="Stanley Park and a Downtown residential area" width="250" /></p>
<p>The conifers were a typical coastal British Columbia mix of <a href="Sitka_spruce" title="wikilink">Sitka spruce</a>, <a href="Western_red_cedar" title="wikilink">Western red cedar</a>, <a href="Western_hemlock" title="wikilink">Western hemlock</a>, <a href="Douglas_fir" title="wikilink">Douglas fir</a>, and <a href="yew" class="uri" title="wikilink">yew</a>, and are thought to have been the greatest concentration of the largest of these trees on the entire <a href="British_Columbia_Coast" title="wikilink">British Columbia Coast</a>. Only in <a href="Seattle,_Washington" title="wikilink">Seattle</a>'s <a href="Elliott_Bay" title="wikilink">Elliott Bay</a> did the trees rival those of Burrard Inlet and English Bay in size. The largest trees in Vancouver's old-growth forest were in the <a href="Gastown" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gastown</a> area, where the first logging occurred, and on the south slopes of <a href="False_Creek" title="wikilink">False Creek</a> and <a href="English_Bay_(Vancouver)" title="wikilink">English Bay</a>, especially around <a href="Jericho_Beach" title="wikilink">Jericho Beach</a>. The forest in Stanley Park is mostly <a href="second_growth_forest" title="wikilink">second and third growth</a>, and evidence of old-fashioned logging techniques such as springboard notches can still be seen there.</p>
<p>A diverse collection of <a href="Flora_of_Canada" title="wikilink">plants</a> and <a href="Trees_of_Canada" title="wikilink">trees</a> were imported from other parts of the continent and from points across the <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">Pacific</a>, and can be found growing throughout Vancouver and the <a href="Lower_Mainland" title="wikilink">Lower Mainland</a>. Various species of <a href="Arecaceae" title="wikilink">palm</a> trees have proven hardy in this climate and are a common sight, as are large numbers of other exotic trees such as the <a href="Araucaria_araucana" title="wikilink">monkey puzzle tree</a>, the <a href="Japanese_Maple" title="wikilink">Japanese Maple</a>, and various flowering exotics such as <a href="magnolia" title="wikilink">magnolias</a>, <a href="azalea" title="wikilink">azaleas</a>, and <a href="rhododendron" title="wikilink">rhododendrons</a>. Many rhododendrons have grown to immense sizes, as have other species imported from harsher climates in Eastern Canada or Europe. The native <a href="Douglas_Maple" title="wikilink">Douglas Maple</a> can also attain a tremendous size. Many streets in the city are lined with flowering varieties of <a href="Sakura" title="wikilink">Japanese cherry</a> trees that were donated by <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>, starting in the 1930s.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Certain areas of <a href="West_Vancouver,_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">West Vancouver</a> that have the right soil requirements are home to the <a href="Arbutus_menziesii" title="wikilink">Arbutus menziesii</a> tree. <img src="Strait_of_Georgia.jpg" title="fig:Strait of Georgia" alt="Strait of Georgia" width="300" /></p>
<p>Vancouver has an area of 114 <a href="square_kilometre" title="wikilink">square kilometres</a> (44 <a href="square_mile" title="wikilink">sq mi</a>), including both flat and hilly ground. Vancouver is adjacent to the <a href="Strait_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">Strait of Georgia</a>, a body of water that is shielded from the Pacific Ocean by <a href="Vancouver_Island" title="wikilink">Vancouver Island</a>. It is in the <a href="Pacific_Time_Zone" title="wikilink">Pacific Time Zone</a> (UTC-8) and the Pacific Maritime Ecozone.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The city itself forms part of the <a href="Burrard_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Burrard Peninsula</a>, lying between <a href="Burrard_Inlet" title="wikilink">Burrard Inlet</a> to the north and the <a href="Fraser_River" title="wikilink">Fraser River</a> to the south. Vancouver is not on nearby Vancouver Island. However, both the island and the city (as well as <a href="Vancouver,_Washington" title="wikilink">Vancouver, Washington</a>) are named after <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a> Captain <a href="George_Vancouver" title="wikilink">George Vancouver</a>.</p>
<p>Vancouver is renowned for its scenery and has one of the largest urban parks in North America, <a href="Stanley_Park" title="wikilink">Stanley Park</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The <a href="North_Shore_Mountains" title="wikilink">North Shore Mountains</a> dominate the cityscape, and on a clear day scenic vistas include the snow-capped volcano <a href="Mount_Baker" title="wikilink">Mount Baker</a> in the State of <a href="Washington" class="uri" title="wikilink">Washington</a> to the southeast, Vancouver Island across the Strait of Georgia to the west and southwest, and the <a href="Sunshine_Coast,_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">Sunshine Coast</a> to the northwest.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> <img src="Stanley_Park_1999_Rain.jpg" title="fig:A rainy day at Third Beach and Siwash Rock in Stanley Park" alt="A rainy day at Third Beach and Siwash Rock in Stanley Park" width="250" /></p>

<p><a href="Urban_planning" title="wikilink">City planners</a> in the late 1950s and 1960s deliberately encouraged the development of high-rise residential towers in Vancouver's <a href="West_End,_Vancouver" title="wikilink">West End</a> of downtown, resulting in a compact urban core amenable to public transit, cycling, and pedestrian traffic. Vancouver's population density on the downtown peninsula is 121 people per <a href="hectare" class="uri" title="wikilink">hectare</a> (or 49 people per <a href="acre" class="uri" title="wikilink">acre</a>), according to the <a href="Canada_2001_Census" title="wikilink">2001 census</a>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The city continues to pursue policies intended to increase density as an alternative to <a href="urban_sprawl" title="wikilink">sprawl</a>, such as Mayor <a href="Sam_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Sam Sullivan</a>'s EcoDensity — an initiative to create quality and high density areas in the city, while making property ownership more economical. The plan also calls for the increased construction of community centres, parks, and cultural facilities.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> <img src="Punjabi_Market_Vancouver_street_sign.jpg" title="fig:Punjabi street sign on Main Street" alt="Punjabi street sign on Main Street" width="200" /></p>
<p>Vancouver has been called a &quot;city of neighbourhoods,&quot; each with a distinct character and ethnic mix.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> People of British origin were historically the largest ethnic group in the city, and elements of British society and culture are highly visible in some areas, particularly South Granville and Kerrisdale. The <a href="Chinese_Canadian" title="wikilink">Chinese</a> are by far the largest visible ethnic group in the city, and Vancouver has one of the most diverse <a href="Chinese_language" title="wikilink">Chinese</a>-speaking communities, with several Chinese languages being represented.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> There are also many monocultural neighbourhoods, such as the <a href="Punjabi_Market,_Vancouver" title="wikilink">Punjabi Market</a>, <a href="Little_Italy,_Vancouver" title="wikilink">Little Italy</a> (roughly synonymous with Commercial Drive but also including the Nanaimo and Hastings area), <a href="Greektown,_Vancouver" title="wikilink">Greektown</a>, and <a href="Japantown,_Vancouver" title="wikilink">Japantown</a>. Bilingual street signs can be seen in various neighbourhoods, including Chinatown and the Punjabi Market.</p>
<p>Many immigrants from <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a> made Vancouver their home in anticipation of the <a href="Transfer_of_the_sovereignty_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">transfer of that former colony's sovereignty</a> from the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> to <a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">China</a>. This continued a tradition of immigration from around the world that had already established Vancouver as the second most popular destination for immigrants in Canada (after <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a>).<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Other significant <a href="Asian_Canadian" title="wikilink">Asian</a> ethnic groups in Vancouver are <a href="South_Asia" title="wikilink">South Asians</a> (mostly <a href="Punjabi_people" title="wikilink">Punjabis</a>, usually referred to as <a href="Indo-Canadian" title="wikilink">Indo-Canadians</a>), <a href="Vietnamese_people" title="wikilink">Vietnamese</a>, <a href="Filipino_people" title="wikilink">Filipino</a>, <a href="Korean_people" title="wikilink">Korean</a>, <a href="Cambodian_people" title="wikilink">Cambodian</a>, and <a href="Japanese_people" title="wikilink">Japanese</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to the Hong Kong influx of the 1980s, the largest non-British ethnic group in the city was <a href="Germans" title="wikilink">German</a>, followed by <a href="Ukrainians" title="wikilink">Ukrainian</a>, <a href="Scandinavia" title="wikilink">Scandinavian</a>, <a href="Italian_people" title="wikilink">Italians</a> and the historical Chinese population. Invisible minorities, such as newly-arrived <a href="Eastern_Europe" title="wikilink">Eastern Europeans</a>, are also a feature of the city's ethnic landscape.</p>
<p>There is also a sizable <a href="Aboriginal_peoples_in_Canada" title="wikilink">aboriginal</a> community in Vancouver as well as in the surrounding metropolitan region, with the result that Vancouver constitutes the largest native community in the province.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>While not completely free of racial tension, Vancouver has relatively harmonious race relations.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> One result is a relatively high rate of intermarriage; mixed ethnicity couples are unremarkable in any neighbourhood. Both the annual <a href="Dragon_Boat_Festival" title="wikilink">Dragon Boat Festival</a> and <a href="Chinese_New_Year" title="wikilink">Lunar New Year's Day</a> Parade are well attended by residents of all ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p>Vancouver has a substantial <a href="gay_community" title="wikilink">gay community</a>, and British Columbia was the second Canadian jurisdiction to legalize <a href="same-sex_marriage_in_Canada" title="wikilink">same-sex marriage</a> as a constitutional right, shortly after <a href="Ontario" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ontario</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The downtown area around Davie Street is home to most of the city's gay clubs and bars and is known as <a href="Davie_Village" title="wikilink">Davie Village</a>.

<p>With its location on the <a href="Pacific_Rim" title="wikilink">Pacific Rim</a> and at the western terminus of Canada's <a href="Trans-Canada_Highway" title="wikilink">transcontinental highway</a> and rail routes, Vancouver is one of the nation's largest industrial centres.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> <img src="Vancouver-westend.jpg" title="fig:Sunset beach at English Bay in the West End of downtown" alt="Sunset beach at English Bay in the West End of downtown" width="250" /></p>
<p>The <a href="Port_of_Vancouver" title="wikilink">Port of Vancouver</a>, Canada's largest and most diversified, does more than <a href="Canadian_dollar" title="wikilink">C$</a>43 billion in trade with over 90 countries annually.

In recent years, Vancouver has become an increasingly important centre for <a href="software_development" title="wikilink">software development</a>, <a href="biotechnology" class="uri" title="wikilink">biotechnology</a> and a vibrant <a href="Cinema_of_Canada" title="wikilink">film industry</a>.</p>
<p>The city's scenic location makes it a major tourist destination. Visitors come for the city's gardens, <a href="Stanley_Park" title="wikilink">Stanley Park</a>, Queen Elizabeth Park, and a multitude of mountains, ocean, forest and parklands surrounding the city. The numerous beaches, parks, waterfronts, and mountain backdrop, combined with its cultural and multi-ethnic character, all contribute to its unique appeal and style for tourists. Over a million people annually pass through Vancouver en route to a <a href="cruise_ship" title="wikilink">cruise ship</a> vacation, usually to <a href="Alaska" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alaska</a>.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>The city's popularity comes with a price. Vancouver can be an expensive city, with the highest housing prices in Canada. Several 2006 studies rank Vancouver as having the least affordable housing in Canada, ranking 13th least affordable in the world, up from 15th in 2005.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The city has adopted various strategies to reduce housing costs, including <a href="housing_cooperative" title="wikilink">cooperative housing</a>, legalized <a href="secondary_suite" title="wikilink">secondary suites</a>, increased density and <a href="smart_growth" title="wikilink">smart growth</a>. The city's residents are generally affluent, a perception reinforced by the number of <a href="luxury_vehicle" title="wikilink">luxury vehicles</a> on city streets and cost of real estate. The average two-storey home in Vancouver sells for $803,500, compared to $425,644 in <a href="Calgary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calgary</a>, the next most expensive major city in Canada.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>A major and ongoing downtown <a href="condominium" class="uri" title="wikilink">condominium</a> construction boom began in the late 1990s, financed in large part by a huge flow of capital from <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a> immigrants prior to the 1997 hand-over to China. High-rise residential developments from this period now dominate the <a href="Yaletown" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yaletown</a> and <a href="Coal_Harbour" title="wikilink">Coal Harbour</a> districts of the downtown peninsula, and also cluster around some of the <a href="SkyTrain_(Vancouver)" title="wikilink">SkyTrain</a> stations on the east side of the city.</p>
<p>The city has been selected to co-host the 2010 Winter Olympics, which is influencing economic development. Concern has been expressed that Vancouver's increasing <a href="homelessness" class="uri" title="wikilink">homelessness</a> problem may be exacerbated by the Olympics because owners of single room occupancy hotels, which house many of the city's lowest income residents, have begun converting their properties in order to attract higher income residents and tourists.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Another significant international event, the <a href="1986_World_Exposition" title="wikilink">1986 World Exposition</a>, was held in Vancouver. It was the last <a href="World&#39;s_Fair" title="wikilink">World's Fair</a> held in North America and was considered a success, receiving 20,111,578 visits. Several Vancouver landmarks date from that period, including the SkyTrain public transit system, the <a href="Plaza_of_Nations" title="wikilink">Plaza of Nations</a>, and <a href="Canada_Place" title="wikilink">Canada Place</a>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> </p>
<h2 id="governance">Governance</h2>

<p>The civic government has been dominated by the <a href="centre-right" class="uri" title="wikilink">centre-right</a> <a href="Non-Partisan_Association" title="wikilink">Non-Partisan Association</a> (NPA) since the <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, albeit with some significant <a href="centre-left" class="uri" title="wikilink">centre-left</a> interludes.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> The NPA's <a href="Sam_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Sam Sullivan</a> was elected mayor of Vancouver in November 2005, signaling the party's return to power after a <a href="New_Democratic_Party_of_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">social democratic</a> slate swept the previous election. The NPA fractured over the issue of <a href="narcotic" title="wikilink">drug</a> policy in 2002, facilitating a landslide victory for the <a href="Coalition_of_Progressive_Electors" title="wikilink">Coalition of Progressive Electors</a> on a <a href="harm_reduction" title="wikilink">harm reduction</a> platform. Subsequently, North America's <a href="Insite" title="wikilink">first safe injection site</a> was opened for the significant number of intravenous <a href="heroin" class="uri" title="wikilink">heroin</a> users in the city.</p>
<p>Vancouver is governed by the ten-member <a href="Vancouver_City_Council" title="wikilink">Vancouver City Council</a>, a nine-member School Board, and a seven-member Parks Board, all elected for three-year terms through an <a href="At-Large" title="wikilink">at-large</a> system. Historically, in all levels of government, the more affluent west side of Vancouver has voted along <a href="Conservatism_in_Canada" title="wikilink">conservative</a> or <a href="Liberalism_in_Canada" title="wikilink">liberal</a> lines while the eastern side of the city has voted along <a href="left-wing_politics" title="wikilink">left-wing</a> lines.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> This was reaffirmed with the results of the <a href="British_Columbia_general_election,_2005" title="wikilink">2005 provincial election</a> and the <a href="Canadian_federal_election_results_in_Vancouver_and_the_Northern_Lower_Mainland" title="wikilink">2006 federal election</a>. <img src="Van_City_Hall_2010_Flag.jpg" title="fig:Vancouver City Hall with the 2010 Winter Olympics Flag" alt="Vancouver City Hall with the 2010 Winter Olympics Flag" width="300" /></p>
<p>Though polarized, a political consensus has emerged in Vancouver around a number of issues. Protection of urban parks, a focus on the development of <a href="rapid_transit" title="wikilink">rapid transit</a> as opposed to a freeway system, a harm reduction approach to illegal drug use, and a general concern about community-based development are examples of policies that have come to have broad support across the <a href="political_spectrum" title="wikilink">political spectrum</a> in Vancouver.</p>
<p>In the <a href="Vancouver_municipal_election,_2005" title="wikilink">2005 Municipal Election</a>, the City Council swung back to the right after a term dominated by the leftist <a href="Coalition_of_Progressive_Electors" title="wikilink">Coalition of Progressive Electors</a> (COPE). NPA mayoral candidate <a href="Sam_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Sam Sullivan</a> narrowly defeated <a href="Jim_Green" title="wikilink">Jim Green</a> for the position of mayor and was joined by five of his party's members on Council. The centrist <a href="Vision_Vancouver" title="wikilink">Vision Vancouver</a> (VVN) brought four members to Council, with the final seat going to COPE. The NPA also won six of nine School Board seats and five of seven Parks Board seats, while the remaining Board seats were won by COPE.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Former Mayor <a href="Larry_Campbell" title="wikilink">Larry Campbell</a> chose not to run for re-election, and was subsequently appointed to the <a href="Senate_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Senate of Canada</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="Legislative_Assembly_of_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">Legislative Assembly of British Columbia</a>, Vancouver is represented by ten <a href="Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly" title="wikilink">Members of the Legislative Assembly</a> (MLAs).

<p>In the <a href="Canadian_House_of_Commons" title="wikilink">Canadian House of Commons</a>, Vancouver is represented by five <a href="Member_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Members of Parliament</a>. In the <a href="Canadian_federal_election,_2004" title="wikilink">2004 federal elections</a>, the <a href="Liberal_Party_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Liberal Party of Canada</a> won four seats and the federal <a href="New_Democratic_Party" title="wikilink">New Democratic Party</a> (NDP) one.

As of February 2006, the Liberals hold three seats, and the NDP and the Conservatives hold one each.</p>
<p>The former mayor, Larry Campbell, came to office in 2002 in part because of his willingness to champion alternative interventions for drug issues, such as supervised injection sites. The city has adopted a <em>Four Pillars Drug Strategy</em>, which combines harm reduction (e.g. needle exchanges, supervised injection sites) with treatment, enforcement, and prevention.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The strategy is largely a response to the endemic <a href="HIV" class="uri" title="wikilink">HIV</a> and <a href="hepatitis_C" title="wikilink">hepatitis C</a> among injection drug users in the city's <a href="Downtown_Eastside" title="wikilink">Downtown Eastside</a> neighbourhood. The area is characterized by entrenched poverty, and consequently is home to the &quot;low track&quot; street sex trade and a bustling &quot;open air&quot; street drug market, which gave rise to a significant <a href="AIDS" class="uri" title="wikilink">AIDS</a> epidemic in the 1990s.

<p>A collection of <a href="Edwardian_period" title="wikilink">Edwardian</a> buildings in the city's old downtown core were, in their day, the tallest buildings in the <a href="British_Empire" title="wikilink">British Empire</a>. These were, in succession, the Province Building, the <a href="Dominion_Building" title="wikilink">Dominion Building</a> (1907, both at Cambie and Hastings Streets), and the <a href="Sun_Tower" title="wikilink">Sun Tower</a> (1911) at Beatty and Pender Streets. The Sun Tower's <a href="cupola" class="uri" title="wikilink">cupola</a> was finally exceeded as the Empire's tallest by the elaborate <a href="Art_Deco" title="wikilink">Art Deco</a> <a href="Marine_Building" title="wikilink">Marine Building</a> in the 1920s.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Inspired by <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York</a>'s <a href="Chrysler_Building" title="wikilink">Chrysler Building</a>, the Marine Building is known for its elaborate <a href="ceramic" class="uri" title="wikilink">ceramic</a> tile facings and brass-gilt doors and elevators, which make it a favourite location for movie shoots.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Another notable Edwardian building in the city is the Vancouver Art Gallery building, designed by Francis Mawson Rattenbury, who also designed the provincial Legislature and the original and highly decorative Hotel Vancouver (torn down after WWII as a condition of the completion of the new Hotel Vancouver a block away).<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> <img src="Vancityskyline_cropped.jpg" title="fig:Downtown Vancouver as seen from Spanish Banks" alt="Downtown Vancouver as seen from Spanish Banks" width="440" /></p>

<p>Vancouver's &quot;View Protection Guidelines&quot; were approved in 1989 and amended in 1990, establishing view corridors in the downtown with height limits to protect views of the <a href="North_Shore_Mountains" title="wikilink">North Shore Mountains</a>. These guidelines have succeeded in preserving mountain views, although some find Vancouver's skyline flat and lacking in visual interest. Many agree that there is a need for some taller buildings to reflect Vancouver's contemporary image, but others are concerned about proposals for much higher buildings. Many believe that the natural setting, and in particular, views of the North Shore Mountains, may be hindered as tall buildings grow in number. In response to these concerns, <a href="Vancouver_City_Council" title="wikilink">Council</a> commissioned a &quot;Skyline Study&quot; in 1997.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<p>The Skyline Study concluded that Vancouver's skyline would benefit from the addition of a handful of buildings exceeding current height limits, to add visual interest to Vancouver's skyline. This led to the <em>General Policy on Higher Buildings</em>. The study noted that the opportunities for such buildings were restricted due to a limited number of large development sites in the downtown. There were at least five sites identified where buildings exceeding the 137 metres (450 ft) height limit are possible, and at least two sites in the northwest corner of the central business district where heights up to 122 metres (400 ft) (exceeding the 91 metres (300 ft) limit) might be considered.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> Eight years later, five of the seven identified sites for higher buildings have been developed or are in the development application process.

<p>Vancouver is a major regional centre for the development of <a href="Music_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Canadian music</a>. The city's musical contributions include performers of classical, folk and popular music.</p>
<p>The city played an important role in the development of <a href="punk_rock" title="wikilink">punk rock</a>, perhaps most famously including the band <a href="D.O.A._(band)" title="wikilink">D.O.A.</a>, <a href="Nomeansno" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nomeansno</a>, and the <a href="industrial_music" title="wikilink">industrial</a> group <a href="Skinny_Puppy" title="wikilink">Skinny Puppy</a>.

<p>Nightlife in Vancouver had, for years, been seen as restricted in comparison to other cities, with early closing times for bars and night clubs, and a reluctance by authorities to allow for further development. However, since 2003 Vancouver has experimented with later closing hours and relaxed regulations, and an effort has been made to develop the Downtown core even further as an entertainment district, especially on and around Granville Street.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
