<p>Route 41 was legislated in 1927 to run from Route 47 in <a href="Fairview,_Gloucester_County,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Fairview</a>, Deptford Township to Route 38 in <a href="Moorestown,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Moorestown</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Originally, the route was intended to bypass <a href="Haddonfield,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Haddonfield</a>, however this bypass was never fully completed and Route 41 was signed along a temporary county-maintained alignment that also became County Route 573. The northern part of this bypass was completed and became <a href="New_Jersey_Route_154" title="wikilink">Route 154</a> in 1953. The road has seen many changes including the replacement of the <a href="traffic_circle" title="wikilink">traffic circle</a> with Routes 38 and 73 with an interchange that involved realigning Route 41 around the original circle in 1960 and the replacement of the <a href="Ellisburg_Circle" title="wikilink">Ellisburg Circle</a> at <a href="New_Jersey_Route_70" title="wikilink">Routes 70</a> and 154 with a signalized intersection in the early 1990s.
