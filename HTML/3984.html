<p><img src="Whistler_Selbstportr&lt;U+00E4&gt;t.jpg" title="fig:Self portrait" alt="Self portrait" width="200" /> <strong>James</strong> <strong>Abbott</strong> <strong>McNeill Whistler</strong> (<a href="July_14" title="wikilink">July 14</a>, <a href="1834" class="uri" title="wikilink">1834</a> – <a href="July_17" title="wikilink">July 17</a>, <a href="1903" class="uri" title="wikilink">1903</a>) was an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a>-born, <a href="United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland" title="wikilink">British</a>-based painter and etcher. Averse to sentimentality in painting, he was a leading proponent of the credo &quot;<a href="art_for_art&#39;s_sake" title="wikilink">art for art's sake</a>&quot;. He took to signing his paintings with a stylized butterfly, possessing a long stinger for a tail. The symbol was apt, for Whistler's art was characterized by a subtle delicacy, in contrast to his flamboyant public persona.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Whistler was born in <a href="Lowell,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Lowell, Massachusetts</a> in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>; the house is now preserved as the <a href="Whistler_House_Museum_of_Art" title="wikilink">Whistler House Museum of Art</a>. His father, <a href="George_Washington_Whistler" title="wikilink">George Washington Whistler</a>, was invited to <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a> in <a href="1842" class="uri" title="wikilink">1842</a> to build a railroad, and James learned French in school while there. At the Ruskin trial (see below), Whistler claimed Russia as his birthplace: &quot;I shall be born when and where I want, and I do not choose to be born in Lowell,&quot; he declared. He also attended the <a href="United_States_Military_Academy" title="wikilink">United States Military Academy</a> at West Point for several years. His departure from this academy seems to have been due to a failure in a chemistry exam; as he himself put it later: &quot;If silicon were a gas, I would have been a general one day.&quot; In European society, he later presented himself as an impoverished Southern aristocrat, although to what extent he truly sympathized with the Southern cause during the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a> remains unclear.</p>
<h2 id="career-and-controversy">Career and controversy</h2>
<p><img src="Whistler-painter.jpg" title="fig:Portrait by Mortimer Menpes" alt="Portrait by Mortimer Menpes" width="200" /> Whistler is best known for the nearly monochromatic full-length figure titled <em>Arrangement in Gray and Black: Portrait of the Artist's Mother</em>, but usually referred to as <em><a href="Whistler&#39;s_Mother" title="wikilink">Whistler's Mother</a></em>. The painting was later purchased by the French government. Though American, Whistler lived and worked mainly in Britain and France.</p>
<p>Whistler's painting <a href=":Image:Whistler.white.393pix.jpg" title="wikilink"><em>The White Girl</em></a> (<a href="1862" class="uri" title="wikilink">1862</a>) caused controversy when exhibited in London and, later, at the <em><a href="Salon_des_Refus&lt;U+00E9&gt;s" title="wikilink">Salon des Refus&lt;U+00E9&gt;s</a></em> in Paris. The painting epitomizes his theory that art should essentially be concerned with the beautiful arrangement of colors in harmony, not with the accurate portrayal of the natural world.</p>
<h3 id="the-peacock-room">The <em>Peacock Room</em></h3>
<p>In the 1870s Whistler painted full length portraits of F.R. Leyland and his wife. Leyland subsequently commissioned the artist to decorate his dining room; the result was Whistler's <em>Harmony in Blue and Gold: The Peacock Room</em>, now in the <a href="Freer_Gallery_of_Art" title="wikilink">Freer Gallery of Art</a>. Artist and patron quarrelled so violently over the room and the proper compensation for the work that their relationship was terminated. The entire room was later purchased by industrialist and aesthete <a href="Charles_Lang_Freer" title="wikilink">Charles Lang Freer</a>, and installed in his collection. The published communications between Freer and Whistler reveal how Whister's interest in those collecting his work in his native country (The United States) transitioned over many decades.</p>
<h3 id="worldwide-recognition">Worldwide recognition</h3>
<p>Despite seemingly courting controversy wherever he went, Whistler achieved worldwide recognition during his lifetime. In <a href="1884" class="uri" title="wikilink">1884</a> he was elected an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. In <a href="1892" class="uri" title="wikilink">1892</a> he was made an officer of the <a href="Legion_d&#39;Honneur" title="wikilink">Legion d'Honneur</a> in France and he became a charter member and first president of the <a href="International_Society_of_Sculptors,_Painters,_&amp;_Gravers" title="wikilink">International Society of Sculptors, Painters, &amp; Gravers</a> in <a href="1898" class="uri" title="wikilink">1898</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ruskin-trial">Ruskin trial</h3>
<p>In <a href="1878" class="uri" title="wikilink">1878</a> Whistler sued the critic <a href="John_Ruskin" title="wikilink">John Ruskin</a> for libel after the critic condemned his painting <em><a href=":Image:James_Abbot_McNeill_Whistler_012.jpg" title="wikilink">Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket</a></em>, writing:</p>
<dl>

<dd>For Mr. Whistler's own sake, no less than for the protection of the purchaser, Sir Coutts Lindsay [founder of the <a href="Grosvenor_Gallery" title="wikilink">Grosvenor Gallery</a>] ought not to have admitted works into the gallery in which the ill-educated conceit of the artist so nearly approached the aspect of willful imposture. I have seen, and heard, much of Cockney impudence before now; but never expected to hear a <a href="Wiktionary:coxcomb" title="wikilink">coxcomb</a> ask two hundred <a href="Guinea_(British_coin)" title="wikilink">guineas</a> for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Though suing for one thousand pounds plus costs, Whistler won a mere <a href="History_of_the_farthing" title="wikilink">farthing</a> in nominal <a href="damages" class="uri" title="wikilink">damages</a>. The cost of the case, together with huge debts from building his residence, &quot;The White House&quot; in Tite Street, Chelsea, (designed with <a href="Edward_William_Godwin" title="wikilink">E.W. Godwin</a>, 1877–8) bankrupted him.</p>

<h3 id="other-relationships">Other relationships</h3>
<p>Friendly with various French artists, he illustrated the book <em>Les Chauves-Souris</em> with <a href="Antonio_de_La_Gandara" title="wikilink">Antonio de La Gandara</a>. He also knew the <a href="impressionism" title="wikilink">impressionists</a>, notably <a href="Edouard_Manet" title="wikilink">Edouard Manet</a> and <a href="Edgar_Degas" title="wikilink">Edgar Degas</a>, and was a leading figure in the <a href="Aesthetic_movement" title="wikilink">Aesthetic movement</a>. As a young artist, he maintained a close friendship with <a href="Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti" title="wikilink">Dante Gabriel Rossetti</a>, a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.</p>
<p>Whistler's lover and model for <em>The White Girl</em>, Joanna Hiffernan, also posed for <a href="Gustave_Courbet" title="wikilink">Gustave Courbet</a>. Historians speculate that Courbet's erotic painting of her as <em><a href="L&#39;Origine_du_monde" title="wikilink">L'Origine du monde</a></em> led to the breakup of the friendship between Whistler and Courbet.</p>
<p>He was well-known for his biting wit, especially in exchanges with his friend <a href="Oscar_Wilde" title="wikilink">Oscar Wilde</a>. Both were figures in the <a href="Caf&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Society" title="wikilink">caf&lt;U+00E9&gt; society</a> of <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a> at the turn of the <a href="20th_century" title="wikilink">20th century</a>. Whistler's famous riposte to Wilde's statement, &quot;I wish I'd said that&quot;, &quot;You will Oscar, you will&quot;, is sometimes attributed to Wilde himself, and may be apocryphal.</p>
<h3 id="printmaking">Printmaking</h3>
<p>A supremely gifted engraver, Whistler produced numerous etchings, lithographs, and dry-points. His lithographs, some drawn on stone, others drawn directly on &quot;lithographie&quot; paper, are perhaps half as numerous as his etchings. Some of the lithographs are of figures slightly draped; two or three of the very finest are of <a href="River_Thames" title="wikilink">Thames</a> subjects — including a &quot;nocturne&quot; at Limehouse; while others depict the <a href="Fauburg_St_Germain" title="wikilink">Fauburg St Germain</a> in Paris, and Georgian churches in <a href="Soho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Soho</a> and <a href="Bloomsbury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bloomsbury</a> in London. The etchings include portraits of family, mistresses, and intimate street scenes in London and <a href="Venice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venice</a>.</p>
<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
<p>Whistler's influence was significant, and has been the subject of museum exhibitions and publications. A trip to Venice in 1880 to create a series of etchings not only reinvigorated Whistler's finances, but also re-energized the way in which artists and photographers interpreted the city. His tonalism had a profound effect on many American artists, including <a href="John_Singer_Sargent" title="wikilink">John Singer Sargent</a> and <a href="William_Merritt_Chase" title="wikilink">William Merritt Chase</a>. Famous proteges included <a href="Oscar_Wilde" title="wikilink">Oscar Wilde</a> and <a href="impressionist" class="uri" title="wikilink">impressionist</a> painter <a href="Walter_Sickert" title="wikilink">Walter Sickert</a>; Whistler fell out with both Wilde and Sickert. He successfully sued Sickert in the <a href="1890" title="wikilink">1890s</a> over a minor legal issue in France. When Wilde was publicly acknowledged to be a <a href="homosexual" class="uri" title="wikilink">homosexual</a> in <a href="1895" class="uri" title="wikilink">1895</a>, Whistler openly mocked him. Another significant influence was upon <a href="Arthur_Frank_Mathews" title="wikilink">Arthur Frank Mathews</a>, whom Whistler met in Paris in the late 1890s. Mathews took Whistler's <a href="Tonalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tonalism</a> to San Francisco, spawning a broad use of that technique among turn of the century California artists.</p>
<p><a href="image:Whistler_Portrait_of_his_Mother.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|200px|Detail of <em>Arrangement in Grey and Black, No 1 (Whistler's Mother)</em> (<a href="1871" class="uri" title="wikilink">1871</a>).</a></p>
<p>Once, after he had suffered a heart attack, a Dutch newspaper <a href="List_of_premature_obituaries" title="wikilink">incorrectly reported</a> Whistler dead. He wrote to the newspaper, saying that reading his own obituary induced a &quot;tender glow of health&quot;.</p>
<p>Whistler published two books which detailed his thoughts on life and art: <em>Ten O'Clock Lecture</em> (1885), and <em>The Gentle Art of Making Enemies</em> (1890).</p>
<p>Whistler's belief that art should concentrate on the arrangement of colors led many critics to see his work as a precursor of abstract art.</p>
<p>He is buried at St Nicholas's Church in <a href="Chiswick" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chiswick</a>, <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>.</p>
