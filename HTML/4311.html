<p>The story takes place in the torture chamber of Tolfi castle in <a href="Sicily" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sicily</a>. The hero of the story is Vivenzio who is confined into an iron cell built deep inside solid rock by the revenge-seeking Prince of Tolfi. Vivenzio is portrayed as a noble man, a warrior and hero of <a href="Naples" class="uri" title="wikilink">Naples</a> but one who fell out of favour with the Prince of Tolfi and now he was about to be subjected to the subtle and remorseless punishment of the Prince. Unbeknownst to the victim, the ceiling and walls of the cell, made of smooth black iron, are imperceptibly contracting through mechanical action. At first the noble victim is unaware of the contracting action of the walls. With the passage of time however the prisoner becomes aware through visual cues that something is afoot. He notices that the irregularly spaced windows of the chamber start decreasing in number each passing day. With only two days left Vivenzio notices an inscription on the iron walls of his cell. The message was written by the engineer of the iron cell, Ludovico Sforza. Sforza explained in his message that at the command of the prince of Tolfi he created the mechanical cell in three years' time. When the chamber was completed, Tolfi ordered the incarceration and death of Sforza in the very chamber he had created. Through a deadly countdown the windows continue decreasing in number, from seven at the beginning of the story, until the end when only one window is left and the iron walls and ceiling contract around him enveloping him in a lethal embrace; the bed in his cell having transformed through mechanical spring action into a &quot;funeral couch or <a href="bier" class="uri" title="wikilink">bier</a>&quot;. Ominously a large bell starts tolling loudly and frequently near the end, as his death approaches. The victim's ears are pierced by the sound and the bier gets crushed as the walls reach their final contraction. The flattened bier becomes the iron shroud of Vivenzio's dead body.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p><a href="Edith_Birkhead" title="wikilink">Edith Birkhead</a> mentions that the &quot;Iron Shroud&quot; belongs in a type of horror story which is all the more striking because it is based on natural effects and not on the <a href="supernatural" class="uri" title="wikilink">supernatural</a>. She describes the suspense in the story as &quot;ingeniously maintained&quot; as the windows disappear one by one until the walls and the &quot;ponderous roof&quot;, all finally collapse upon the victim.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In the &quot;Iron Shroud&quot; the hero, Vivenzio, is aware that he will eventually die. The only remaining question is the mode of his death. The uncertainty over the method of the execution and the manner of death creates the narrative tension. As he observes the windows disappearing one by one, he finally realises the method of his death:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes, that is to be my fate! Yon roof will descend!--these walls will hem me round--and, slowly, slowly, crush me in their iron arms! Lord God! look down upon me, and in mercy strike me with instant death! Oh, fiend--oh, devil--is this your revenge?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;iron arms&quot; analogy is apt because in the end the mechanical cell will replace everything Vivenzio knew while incarcerated, including his body. His bed, his bier, his iron shroud and even his skeleton which will eventually turn to dust, will disappear because they will all be crushed. Everything will be replaced in the end by the iron walls of the cell, as if there were an exchange of bodies between Vivenzio and the iron cell. In fact the mind of the victim collapses in fear and enacts his death before it actually happens, thus in itself becoming an instrument of oppression and torture.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

M. S. Tompkins in his 1927 work &quot;Jane Eyre's 'Iron Shroud'&quot; attributes the metaphor used by <a href="Charlotte_Bront&lt;U+00EB&gt;" title="wikilink">Charlotte Bront&lt;U+00EB&gt;</a> in the thirty-fourth chapter of her work <em><a href="Jane_Eyre" title="wikilink">Jane Eyre</a></em>:</p>

<p><a href="John_H._Collins" title="wikilink">John H. Collins</a>, analysing the influence of Mudford's work, comments that &quot;the Shroud story is a first rate piece of writing comparable to the best half-dozen works by Poe&quot; and that &quot;it should not just be dismissed as a mere potboiler which the genius of Poe transformed.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> He goes on to mention that he thinks many readers mistakenly think that the &quot;Iron Shroud&quot; is one of Poe's works thus further strengthening Poe's reputation by attributing to him a story that he actually plagiarised.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Edith_Birkhead" title="wikilink">Edith Birkhead</a> calls the &quot;Iron Shroud&quot; a &quot;skillfully constructed&quot; story and mentions that Mudford has been described by <a href="Walter_Scott" title="wikilink">Sir Walter Scott</a> as an author who &quot;loves to play at cherry-pit with Satan.&quot;; a <a href="Shakespeare" title="wikilink">Shakespearean</a> expression used to indicate familiarity with the Devil.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Alexander Hammond, Associate Professor and Vice Chair of the Department of English at Washington State University, in his essay &quot;Subverting Interpretation: Poe&lt;U+2019&gt;s Geometry in &lt;U+201C&gt;The Pit and the Pendulum&lt;U+201D&gt;&quot; suggests that Mudford's countdown of windows in the &quot;Iron Shroud&quot; may have influenced Poe in using numerical and geometrical clues in the &quot;Pit and the Pendulum&quot; to confuse and frighten his narrator.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Elizabeth_Gaskell" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Gaskell</a>, in <a href="Mary_Barton" title="wikilink">Mary Barton</a> describes an Italian torture chamber where the victim is afforded many luxuries at first but in the end the walls of the cell start closing in and finally they crush him. It is believed that the story has been influenced by the &quot;Iron Shroud&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Stephen Derry mentions that Gaskell uses the concept of the shrinking cell to describe John Barton's state of mind but also added the element of luxury in order to further enhance it:</p>

<p>Derry further mentions that Mrs. Gaskell's readers were familiar with the story of &quot;The Iron Shroud&quot; as was Charlotte Bront&lt;U+00EB&gt;.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
