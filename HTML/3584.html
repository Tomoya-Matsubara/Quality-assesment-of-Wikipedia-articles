Washington Post Staff Writer Alan Cooperman characterized Ellison's articles saying that he &quot;defended Farrakhan against accusations of <a href="anti-semitism" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-semitism</a>,&quot; and that Ellison &quot;called affirmative action a 'sneaky' form of compensation for slavery, suggesting instead that white Americans pay <a href="Reparations_for_slavery" title="wikilink">reparations</a> to blacks.&quot; <a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a><a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a><a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>

In response, Ellison wrote a letter to the <a href="Jewish_Community_Relations_Council" title="wikilink">Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota &amp; the Dakotas</a> asserting he was never a member, and that his connections with the Nation of Islam were limited to an 18-month period to help organize the Minnesota contingent to the <a href="Million_Man_March" title="wikilink">Million Man March</a> in 1995.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a><a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a><a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> In Ellison's letter, he denounced the Nation of Islam and Farrakhan, writing &quot;I wrongly dismissed concerns that they [Farrakhan's remarks] were anti-semitic. They were and are anti-semitic and I should have come to that conclusion earlier than I did.&quot;<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> He explained his previous views, saying that he, &quot;did not adequately scrutinize the positions and statements of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, and Khalid Muhammed.&quot; He also stated that &quot;any kind of discrimination and hate are wrong. This has always been my position&quot;. During the 2006 campaign, many prominent Jewish DFL activists supported Ellison, including fundraisers <a href="Samuel_L._Kaplan" title="wikilink">Samuel and Sylvia Kaplan</a>, and State Representative Phyllis Kahn, who said it was &quot;inconceivable that he could have ever been an anti-Semite.&quot;<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>

<p>His Republican opponent in the race, Alan Fine, criticized Ellison for accepting these contributions, asserting that CAIR was &quot;a group that Democrats say has deep ties to terrorism&quot;.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> In response to Ellison's opponents, CAIR leaders <a href="Parvez_Ahmed" title="wikilink">Parvez Ahmed</a> and Nihad Awad wrote &quot;We are proud of our personal donations to Ellison's campaign&quot; and derided any 'guilt by association' arguments.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="campaign-finance-violations">Campaign finance violations</h3>
<p>In early 2006, the <a href="http://www.cfboard.state.mn.us/">Minnesota State Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board</a> reprimanded Ellison for unreported campaign contributions, discrepancies in cash balances, and misclassified disbursements during his campaigns for the Minnesota House of Representatives. These transgressions occurred in the years 2002&lt;U+2013&gt;2004. In 2005, the board opened an investigation, and Ellison was subpoenaed and fined.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a><a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="reichstag-fire-and-911">Reichstag fire and 9/11</h3>
<p>On July 8, 2007, Ellison discussed the power of the executive branch in the US currently in a speech before the organization <em>Atheists for Human Rights</em>. He stated that <a href="Dick_Cheney" title="wikilink">Dick Cheney</a> asserts it is &quot;beneath his dignity in order for him to answer any questions from the citizens of the United States. That is the very definition of <a href="totalitarianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">totalitarianism</a>, <a href="authoritarianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">authoritarianism</a> and <a href="dictatorship" class="uri" title="wikilink">dictatorship</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> He went on to say, &quot;It's almost like the <a href="Reichstag_fire" title="wikilink">Reichstag fire</a>, kind of reminds me of that. After the Reichstag was burned, they blamed the <a href="Communists" class="uri" title="wikilink">Communists</a> for it and it put the leader of that country <a href="Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Hitler</a> in a position where he could basically have authority to do whatever he wanted. The fact is that I'm not saying <a href="September_11_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11</a> was a U.S. plan, or anything like that because, you know, that's how they put you in the nut-ball box &lt;U+2014&gt; dismiss you.&quot;<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Fox_News" title="wikilink">Fox News</a> picked up the story<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> and their commentator <a href="John_Gibson_(media_host)" title="wikilink">John Gibson</a> categorized Ellison's comments as accusing &quot;<a href="George_W._Bush" title="wikilink">Bush</a> of planning and executing the 9/11 attacks&quot;.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> In Congress, Representatives <a href="Eric_Cantor" title="wikilink">Eric Cantor</a> and <a href="Zach_Wamp" title="wikilink">Zach Wamp</a> wrote House Speaker <a href="Nancy_Pelosi" title="wikilink">Nancy Pelosi</a> demanding she &quot;swiftly and immediately&quot; reprimand Ellison for his remarks.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> The letter said &quot;Even if Ellison asserts that he was not implying that 9/11 was orchestrated by the administration, the comparison he draws between Hitler and the President of United States is disgraceful. These comments inflame hatred and division at a time when we should be promoting our unity and reconciliation.&quot;<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a><a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> The <a href="Anti-Defamation_League" title="wikilink">Anti-Defamation League</a> also stated &quot;Whatever his views may be on the administration's response to 9/11 and the conduct of the <a href="war_on_terrorism" title="wikilink">war on terrorism</a>, likening it to Hitler's rise to power and <a href="Nazism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nazism</a> is odious and demeans the victims of 9/11 and the brave American men and women engaged in the <a href="war_on_terror" title="wikilink">war on terror</a>. Furthermore, it demonstrates a profound lack of understanding about the horrors that Hitler and his Nazi regime perpetrated.&quot;<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>
<p>When later questioned about his comments, Ellison told a reporter that Osama bin Laden, and not the Bush administration, was responsible for the attacks.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> Ellison also said, &quot;In the aftermath of a tragedy, space is opened up for governments to take action that they could not have achieved before that.&quot; He pointed to the <a href="Iraq_War" title="wikilink">Iraq War</a> and provisions granting greater arrest and surveillance powers within the <a href="USA_PATRIOT_Act" title="wikilink">USA PATRIOT Act</a> as examples.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> Ellison said also &quot;In response to a question, I stated that the Bush Administration exploited post-9/11 fears to advance a policy agenda that has undermined our civil liberties. I stand by this statement. ...I want to be clear that the murderous Nazi regime is historically distinct and the horror of the <a href="Holocaust" class="uri" title="wikilink">Holocaust</a> must be acknowledged as a unique event in human history. I did not intend any direct comparison between the totalitarian state of Nazi Germany and the current administration.

<h3 id="sali-remarks">Sali remarks</h3>
<p>Representative <a href="Bill_Sali" title="wikilink">Bill Sali</a>, drew criticism for his comments in an August 8, 2007 interview with the conservative <a href="Christian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christian</a>-based <em>American Family News Network</em>. Sali, an outspoken <a href="Evangelical_Christian" title="wikilink">Evangelical Christian</a>, denounced the <a href="US_Senate" title="wikilink">Senate</a> leadership for allowing a <a href="Hindu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hindu</a> to lead the opening prayer. He held that invoking a non-Christian god in the Senate threatened to endanger America by removing &quot;the protective hand of God.&quot;<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> He then went on to say &quot;We have not only a Hindu prayer being offered in the Senate, we have a Muslim member of the House of Representatives now, Keith Ellison from Minnesota. Those are changes and they are not what was envisioned by the Founding Fathers. The principles that this country was built on, that have made it great over these centuries, were Christian principles derived from Scripture. You know the Lord can make the rain fall on the just and the unjust alike.&quot;</p>
<p>Former Idaho Democratic congressman <a href="Richard_H._Stallings" title="wikilink">Richard Stallings</a>, among others, demanded that Sali either apologize or resign. In response Sali sent Ellison an e-mail saying he &quot;meant no offense.&quot;<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> At the time Ellison was in <a href="Iraq" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iraq</a> with a congressional delegation, his spokesperson said &quot;The congressman just doesn't respond to comments like that.&quot;<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> Sali stressed to reporters that he was not calling for Ellison to be removed, &quot;He got elected the same way I did. People certainly have the right to elect anyone they want.&quot;<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> Sali defended his claim about America's founding principles, saying, &quot;The idea that somehow we can move to <a href="multiculturalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">multiculturalism</a> and still remain the same &lt;U+2014&gt; I think that's a little dangerous, too. From my standpoint, I believe the Founding Fathers were overwhelmingly Christian and the God they were talking about is the God of the Bible.&quot;<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> When asked about his policy discussions with those of other faiths he stated, &quot;I would say, 'These are principles that I think are important,' and if he agrees with those, great. At the end of the game, maybe it does get down to religious beliefs and how they impact how you make public policy.&quot;<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> It has been noted in a <em><a href="New_York_Sun" title="wikilink">New York Sun</a></em> editorial that claims dogging Ellison that the founders of the US did not anticipate Muslim legislators are incorrect.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> The specific subject was brought up in many of the <a href="Timeline_of_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">State conventions to ratify the Constitution</a>, including remarks by William Lancaster in the <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a> Ratifying Convention in 1788.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a><a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a></p>
