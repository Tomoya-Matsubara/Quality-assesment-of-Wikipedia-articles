<p><strong>Kiev</strong> or <strong>Kyiv</strong> ( ; ; (see also <a href="Names_of_European_cities_in_different_languages:_I&lt;U+2013&gt;L#K" title="wikilink">Cities' alternative names</a>)) is the <a href="Capital_city" title="wikilink">capital</a> and the largest city of <a href="Ukraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ukraine</a>, located in the north central part of the country on the <a href="Dnieper_River" title="wikilink">Dnieper River</a>. The population as of the 2001 <a href="census" class="uri" title="wikilink">census</a> was 2,611,300. However, higher numbers have been cited in the press.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Kiev is an important <a href="industry" title="wikilink">industrial</a>, <a href="science" title="wikilink">scientific</a>, <a href="education" title="wikilink">educational</a> and <a href="culture" title="wikilink">cultural</a> centre of <a href="Eastern_Europe" title="wikilink">Eastern Europe</a>. It is home to many <a href="High_tech" title="wikilink">high-tech</a> industries, <a href="higher_education" title="wikilink">higher education</a> institutions and world-famous historical landmarks. The city has an extensive infrastructure and highly developed system of <a href="public_transport" title="wikilink">public transport</a>, including the <a href="Kiev_Metro" title="wikilink">Kiev Metro</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kiev is said to derive from the name of <a href="Kyi,_Schek_and_Khoryv" title="wikilink">Kyi</a>, one of four legendary founders of the city (brothers Kyi, Shchek, Khoryv, and sister Lybid). During <a href="History_of_Kiev" title="wikilink">its history</a>, Kiev, one of the oldest cities in <a href="Eastern_Europe" title="wikilink">Eastern Europe</a>, passed through several stages of great prominence and relative obscurity. The city probably existed as a commercial centre as early as the 5th century. A <a href="Slavs" title="wikilink">Slavic</a> settlement on the great trade route between <a href="Scandinavia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scandinavia</a> and <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a>, Kiev was a tributary of the <a href="Khazars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khazars</a>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> until seized by the <a href="Varangians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Varangians</a> (<a href="Vikings" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vikings</a>) in the mid 9th century. Under <a href="Varangians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Varangians</a> rule, the city became a capital of the <a href="Kievan_Rus&#39;" title="wikilink">Rus'</a>, the first <a href="East_Slavs" title="wikilink">East Slavic</a> state. Completely destroyed during the <a href="Mongol_invasion_of_Rus&#39;" title="wikilink">Mongol invasion</a> in 1240, the city lost most of its influence for the centuries to come. It was a provincial capital of marginal importance in the outskirts of the territories controlled by its powerful neighbours; first the <a href="Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania" title="wikilink">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>, followed by <a href="Crown_of_the_Kingdom_of_Poland" title="wikilink">Poland</a> and <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russia</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The city prospered again during the <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russian Empire</a>'s <a href="Industrial_Revolution" title="wikilink">industrial revolution</a> in the late 19th century. In 1917, after the <a href="Ukrainian_National_Republic" title="wikilink">Ukrainian National Republic</a> declared independence from the Russian Empire, Kiev became its capital. And from 1921 onwards Kiev was an important city of the <a href="Ukrainian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic" title="wikilink">Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic</a>, and, from 1934, its capital. During <a href="Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, the city again suffered significant damage, but quickly recovered in the post-war years, remaining the third largest city of the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>. Following the <a href="Collapse_of_the_Soviet_Union_(1985&lt;U+2013&gt;1991)" title="wikilink">collapse of the Soviet Union</a> and the <a href="History_of_Ukraine" title="wikilink">Ukrainian independence</a> of 1991, Kiev remained the capital of <a href="Ukraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ukraine</a>.</p>

<p>Kiev is one of the oldest cities of <a href="Eastern_Europe" title="wikilink">Eastern Europe</a> and has played a pivotal role in the development of the medieval <a href="East_Slavs" title="wikilink">East Slavic</a> civilization as well as in the modern <a href="Ukraine" title="wikilink">Ukrainian nation</a>.</p>
<p>It is believed that Kiev was founded in 482 CE. The origin of the city is obscured by legends, one of which tells about a founding-family consisting of a Slavic tribe leader Kyi, the eldest, his brothers Schek and Khoriv, and also their sister Lybid, who founded the city (The <a href="Primary_Chronicle" title="wikilink">Primary Chronicle</a>). According to it the name Kyiv/Kiev means to &quot;belong to Kyi&quot;. Some claim to find reference to the city in Ptolemy&lt;U+2019&gt;s work as the Metropolity (the 2nd century).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The non-legendary time of the founding of the city is harder to ascertain. Scattered <a href="Slavic_peoples" title="wikilink">Slavic</a> settlements existed in the area from the 6th century, but it is unclear whether any of them later developed into the city. 8th century fortifications were built upon a <a href="Slav_(village)" title="wikilink">Slavic</a> settlement apparently abandoned some decades before. It is still unclear whether these fortifications were built by the <a href="Slavic_peoples" title="wikilink">Slavs</a> or the <a href="Khazars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khazars</a>. If it was the Slavic peoples then it is also uncertain when Kiev fell under the rule of the <a href="Khazars" title="wikilink">Khazar</a> empire or whether the city was, in fact, founded by the <a href="Khazars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khazars</a>. The <a href="Primary_Chronicle" title="wikilink">Primary Chronicle</a> (a main source of information about the early history of the area) mentions Slavic Kievans telling <a href="Askold_and_Dir" title="wikilink">Askold and Dir</a> that they live without a local ruler and pay a tribute to the <a href="Khazars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khazars</a> in an event attributed to the 9th century. At least during the 8th and 9th centuries Kiev functioned as an outpost of the Khazar empire. A hill-fortress, called Sambat (Old Turkic for &quot;High Place&quot;) was built to defend the area. At some point during the late ninth or early tenth century Kiev fell under the rule of <a href="Varangians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Varangians</a> (see <a href="Askold_and_Dir" title="wikilink">Askold and Dir</a>, and <a href="Oleg_of_Novgorod" title="wikilink">Oleg of Novgorod</a>) and became the nucleus of the Rus' polity. The date given for Oleg's conquest of the town in the Primary Chronicle is 882, but some historians, such as <a href="Omeljan_Pritsak" title="wikilink">Omeljan Pritsak</a> and <a href="Constantine_Zuckerman" title="wikilink">Constantine Zuckerman</a>, dispute this and maintain that Khazar rule continued as late as the 920s (documentary evidence exists to support this assertion &lt;U+2014&gt; see the <a href="Kievian_Letter" title="wikilink">Kievian Letter</a> and <a href="Schechter_Letter" title="wikilink">Schechter Letter</a>.) Other historians suggest that the Magyar tribes ruled the city between 840 and 878, before migrating with some <a href="Khazars" title="wikilink">Khazar</a> tribes to <a href="Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungary</a>.</p>

<p>During the eighth and ninth centuries, Kiev was an outpost of the <a href="Khazars" title="wikilink">Khazar</a> empire. Starting in the late ninth century or early tenth century Kiev was ruled by the <a href="Varangians" title="wikilink">Varangian</a> nobility and became the nucleus of the <a href="Rus_(name)" title="wikilink">Rus'</a> polity, whose 'Golden Age' (eleventh to early twelfth centuries) has from the nineteenth century become referred to as <a href="Kievan_Rus&#39;" title="wikilink">Kievan Rus'</a>. In 968, the nomadic <a href="Pechenegs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pechenegs</a> attacked and then <a href="Siege_of_Kiev_(968)" title="wikilink">besieged the city</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In 1203 Kiev was captured and burned by Prince <a href="Rurik_Rostislavich" title="wikilink">Rurik Rostislavich</a> and his <a href="Kipchaks" title="wikilink">Kipchak</a> allies. In the 1230s the city was besieged and ravaged by different Russian princes several times. In 1240 the <a href="Mongol_invasion_of_Rus&#39;" title="wikilink">Mongol invasion of Rus</a> led by <a href="Batu_Khan" title="wikilink">Batu Khan</a> completely <a href="Siege_of_Kiev_(1240)" title="wikilink">destroyed Kiev</a>,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> an event that had a profound effect on the future of the city and the <a href="Culture_of_ancient_Rus" title="wikilink">East Slavic civilization</a>. At the time of the Mongol destruction, Kiev was reputed as one of the largest cities in the world, with a population exceeding one hundred thousand.</p>

<p>In the early 1320s, a Lithuanian army led by <a href="Gediminas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gediminas</a> defeated a Slavic army led by Stanislav of Kiev at the <a href="Battle_on_the_Irpen&#39;_River" title="wikilink">Battle on the Irpen' River</a>, and conquered the city. The Tatars, who also claimed Kiev, retaliated in 1324&lt;U+2013&gt;1325, so while Kiev was ruled by a Lithuanian prince, it had to pay a tribute to the <a href="Golden_Horde" title="wikilink">Golden Horde</a>. Finally, as a result of the <a href="Battle_of_Blue_Waters" title="wikilink">Battle of Blue Waters</a> in 1362, Kiev and surrounding areas were incorporated into the <a href="Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania" title="wikilink">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a> by <a href="Algirdas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Algirdas</a>, Grand Duke of Lithuania.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In 1569 (<a href="Union_of_Lublin" title="wikilink">Union of Lublin</a>), when the <a href="Polish&lt;U+2013&gt;Lithuanian_Commonwealth" title="wikilink">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> was established, the Lithuanian-controlled lands of the Kiev region, Podolia, Volhynia, and Podlachia, were transferred from Grand Duchy of Lithuania to the <a href="Crown_of_the_Kingdom_of_Poland" title="wikilink">Crown of the Kingdom of Poland</a>, and Kiev became the capital of <a href="Kiev_Voivodeship" title="wikilink">Kiev Voivodeship</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In 1658 (<a href="Treaty_of_Hadiach" title="wikilink">Treaty of Hadiach</a>), Kiev was supposed to become the capital of the <a href="Duchy_of_Rus&#39;" title="wikilink">Duchy of Rus'</a> within <a href="Polish&lt;U+2013&gt;Lithuanian&lt;U+2013&gt;Ruthenian_Commonwealth" title="wikilink">Polish&lt;U+2013&gt;Lithuanian&lt;U+2013&gt;Ruthenian Commonwealth</a>,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> but the treaty was never ratified to this extent.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Kept by the Russian troops since 1654 (<a href="Treaty_of_Pereyaslav" title="wikilink">Treaty of Pereyaslav</a>), it became a part of the <a href="Tsardom_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Tsardom of Russia</a> from 1667 on (<a href="Truce_of_Andrusovo" title="wikilink">Truce of Andrusovo</a>) and enjoyed a degree of autonomy. In the <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russian Empire</a> Kiev was a primary <a href="Christian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christian</a> centre, attracting <a href="pilgrim" title="wikilink">pilgrims</a>, and the cradle of many of the empire's most important religious figures, but until the 19th century the city's commercial importance remained marginal.</p>

<p>In 1834, the Saint Vladimir University was established; it is now called the <a href="Taras_Shevchenko_National_University_of_Kiev" title="wikilink">Taras Shevchenko National University of Kiev</a> after the Ukrainian poet <a href="Taras_Shevchenko" title="wikilink">Taras Shevchenko</a>. Shevchenko was a field researcher and editor for the geography department.</p>
<p>During the 18th and 19th centuries city life was dominated by the <a href="Armed_Forces_of_the_Russian_Federation" title="wikilink">Russian military</a> and ecclesiastical authorities; the <a href="Russian_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Russian Orthodox Church</a> formed a significant part of Kiev's infrastructure and business activity. In the late 1840s, the historian, <a href="Nikolay_Kostomarov" title="wikilink">Mykola Kostomarov</a> <em>()</em>, founded a secret political society, the Brotherhood of <a href="Saints_Cyril_and_Methodius" title="wikilink">Saint Cyril</a> and <a href="Saints_Cyril_and_Methodius" title="wikilink">Methodius</a>, whose members put forward the idea of a federation of free Slavic people with Ukrainians as a distinct and separate group rather than a subordinate part of the Russian nation; the society was quickly suppressed by the authorities.</p>
<p>Following the gradual loss of Ukraine's autonomy, Kiev experienced growing Russification in the 19th century by means of Russian migration, administrative actions and social modernization. At the beginning of the 20th century, the city centre was dominated by the Russian-speaking part of the population, while the <a href="Social_class" title="wikilink">lower classes</a> living on the outskirts retained Ukrainian <a href="folk_culture" title="wikilink">folk culture</a> to a significant extent. However, enthusiasts among ethnic Ukrainian nobles, military and merchants made recurrent attempts to preserve native culture in Kiev (by clandestine book-printing, amateur theatre, folk studies etc.)</p>

<p>During the Russian industrial revolution in the late 19th century, Kiev became an important trade and transportation centre of the <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russian Empire</a>, specialising in sugar and grain export by railway and on the Dnieper river. As of 1900, the city had also become a significant industrial centre, having a population of 250,000. Landmarks of that period include the railway infrastructure, the foundation of numerous educational and cultural facilities as well as notable architectural monuments (mostly merchant-oriented). The <a href="Kiev_tram" title="wikilink">first electric tram line</a> of the Russian Empire was established in Kiev (arguably, the first in the world).</p>
<p>Kiev prospered during the late nineteenth century <a href="Industrial_Revolution" title="wikilink">industrial revolution</a> in the <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russian Empire</a>, when it became the third most important city of the Empire and the major centre of commerce of its southwest. In the <a href="Ukraine_after_the_Russian_Revolution" title="wikilink">turbulent period</a> following the <a href="Russian_Revolution_(1917)" title="wikilink">1917 Russian Revolution</a>, Kiev became the capital of several <a href="Ukrainian_People&#39;s_Republic" title="wikilink">short-lived Ukrainian states</a> and was caught in the middle of several conflicts: <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, the <a href="Russian_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Russian Civil War</a>, and the <a href="Polish&lt;U+2013&gt;Soviet_War" title="wikilink">Polish-Soviet War</a>.

<p>Starting in 1921, the city was a part of the <a href="Ukrainian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic" title="wikilink">Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic</a>, a founding republic of the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>. Kiev was greatly affected by all the major processes that took place in Soviet Ukraine during the <a href="interwar_period" title="wikilink">interwar period</a>: the 1920s <a href="Ukrainization" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ukrainization</a> as well as the migration of the rural <a href="Ukrainian_language" title="wikilink">Ukrainophone</a> population made the <a href="Russophone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russophone</a> city Ukrainian-speaking and propped up the development of the <a href="Ukrainian_culture" title="wikilink">Ukrainian cultural life</a> in the city; the <a href="History_of_the_Soviet_Union_(1927&lt;U+2013&gt;1953)" title="wikilink">Soviet Industrialization</a> that started in the late 1920s turned the city, a former centre of commerce and religion, into a major industrial, technological and scientific centre, the <a href="Holodomor" title="wikilink">1932&lt;U+2013&gt;1933 Great Famine</a> devastated the part of the migrant population not registered for the ration cards, and <a href="Joseph_Stalin" title="wikilink">Joseph Stalin</a>'s <a href="Great_Purge" title="wikilink">Great Purge</a> of 1937&lt;U+2013&gt;1938 almost eliminated the city's <a href="intelligentsia" class="uri" title="wikilink">intelligentsia</a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1934 Kiev became the capital of Soviet Ukraine. The city boomed again during the years of the Soviet industrialization as its population grew rapidly and many industrial giants were created, some of which exist to this day.</p>
<p>In <a href="Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, the city again suffered significant damage, and was occupied by <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi Germany</a> from 19 September 1941 to 6 November 1943. Shortly after the city was occupied, a team of <a href="NKVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">NKVD</a> officers that had remained hidden dynamited most of the buildings on the Khreshchatyk, the main street of the city, most of whose buildings were being used by German military and civil authorities; the buildings burned for days and 25,000 people were left homeless, and in retaliation the Germans rounded up all the local Jews they could find and massacred them at <a href="Babi_Yar" title="wikilink">Babi Yar</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Kiev quickly recovered in the post-war years, becoming once again the third most important city of the Soviet Union. The <a href="Chernobyl_disaster" title="wikilink">catastrophic accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant</a> occurred only  north of the city. However, the prevailing northward winds blew most of the radioactive debris away from the city.</p>
<p>In the wake of the <a href="Collapse_of_the_Soviet_Union_(1985&lt;U+2013&gt;1991)" title="wikilink">collapse of the Soviet Union</a> the <a href="Declaration_of_Independence_of_Ukraine" title="wikilink">Declaration of Independence of Ukraine</a> was proclaimed in the city by the <a href="Verkhovna_Rada" title="wikilink">Ukrainian parliament</a> on August 24, 1991.

Experiencing rapid population growth between the 1970s and the mid-1990s, the city has continued its consistent growth after the turn of the millennium. As a result, Kiev's central districts provide a dotted contrast of new, modern buildings amongst the pale yellows, blues and grays of older apartments. Urban sprawl has gradually reduced, while population densities of suburbs has increased. The most expensive properties are located in the <a href="Pechersk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pechersk</a>, and <a href="Khreshchatyk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khreshchatyk</a> areas.

Music from <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a> and <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a> started appearing on Ukrainian music charts.

<p>Geographically, Kiev belongs to the <a href="Polesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Polesia</a> ecological zone (a part of the European mixed woods). However, the city's unique landscape distinguishes it from the surrounding region.</p>
<p>Kiev is located on both sides of the <a href="Dnieper_River" title="wikilink">Dnieper River</a>, which flows south through the city towards the <a href="Black_Sea" title="wikilink">Black Sea</a>. The older right-bank (<em>western</em>) part of the city is represented by numerous woody hills, ravines and small rivers. It is a part of the larger Dnieper Upland adjoining the western bank of the Dnieper in its mid-flow. Kiev expanded to the Dnieper's lowland left bank (<em>to the east</em>) only in the 20th century. Significant areas of the left-bank Dnieper valley were artificially sand-deposited, and are protected by <a href="dam" title="wikilink">dams</a>.</p>
<p>The Dnieper River forms a branching system of <a href="tributary" title="wikilink">tributaries</a>, isles, and harbors within the city limits. The city is adjoined by the mouth of the <a href="Desna_River" title="wikilink">Desna River</a> and the <a href="Kiev_Reservoir" title="wikilink">Kiev Reservoir</a> in the north, and the <a href="Kaniv_Reservoir" title="wikilink">Kaniv Reservoir</a> in the south. Both the Dnieper and Desna rivers are <a href="navigation" title="wikilink">navigable</a> at Kiev, although regulated by the reservoir shipping locks and limited by winter freeze-over.</p>
<p>In total, there are 448 bodies of open water within boundaries of Kiev, which include Dnieper itself, its reservoirs, and several small rivers, dozens of <a href="lake" title="wikilink">lakes</a> and artificially created <a href="pond" title="wikilink">ponds</a>. They occupy 7949 hectares of territory. Additionally, the city boasts of 16 developed <a href="beach" title="wikilink">beaches</a> (totalling 140 hectares) and 35 near-water recreational areas (covering more than 1000 hectares). Many are used for pleasure and recreation, although some of the bodies of water are not suitable for swimming.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="climate">Climate</h3>
<p>Kiev has a <a href="continental_climate" title="wikilink">humid continental</a> <a href="climate" class="uri" title="wikilink">climate</a> (<a href="K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppen_climate_classification" title="wikilink">Koppen</a> <em>Dfb</em>). The warmest months are June, July, and August, with mean temperatures of . The coldest are December, January, and February, with mean temperatures of . The highest ever temperature recorded in the city was  on 31 July 1936. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city was  on 7 &amp; 9 February 1929. Snow cover usually lies from mid-November to the end of March, with the frost-free period lasting 180 days on average, but surpassing 200 days in recent years.</p>

<h2 id="government">Government</h2>

<p>The <a href="municipality" class="uri" title="wikilink">municipality</a> of the city of Kiev has a special legal status within Ukraine compared to the other <a href="Administrative_divisions_of_Ukraine" title="wikilink">administrative subdivisions of the country</a>. The most significant difference is that the city is subordinated directly to the national-level branches of the <a href="Government_of_Ukraine" title="wikilink">Government of Ukraine</a>, skipping the <a href="oblast" title="wikilink">regional level authorities</a> of <a href="Kiev_Oblast" title="wikilink">Kiev Oblast</a>. Additionally, the Head of City Administration&lt;U+2014&gt;the leading executive position is held by a directly elected, rather than appointed, figure, who is also the Head of City Council&lt;U+2014&gt;the <a href="Mayor_of_Kiev" title="wikilink">Mayor of Kiev</a>, and municipal institutions have a higher level of self governance than elsewhere in Ukraine.</p>

<h3 id="subdivisions">Subdivisions</h3>


<p>The first known formal subdivision of Kiev dates to 1810 when the city was subdivided into 4 parts: <a href="Pechersk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pechersk</a>, Starokyiv, and the first and the second parts of <a href="Podil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Podil</a>. In 1833&lt;U+2013&gt;1834 according to <a href="Russian_tsar" title="wikilink">Tsar</a> <a href="Nicholas_I_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Nicholas I</a>'s decree, Kiev was subdivided into 6 police raions; later being increased to 10. As of 1917, there were 8 Raion Councils (<em>Duma</em>), which were reorganised by <a href="bolshevik" title="wikilink">bolsheviks</a> into 6 Party-Territory Raions.</p>
<p>Over the Soviet time, as city was expanding, the number of raions was gradually increasing. The raions has been also commonly named after Soviet party leaders, and as political situation was changing and some leaders were overturned by the other, so raion names were also changing.</p>
<p>The last raion reform took place in 2001 when the number of raions has been decreased from 14 to 10.</p>
<p>Under <a href="Oleksandr_Omelchenko" title="wikilink">Oleksandr Omelchenko</a> (<a href="Mayor_of_Kiev" title="wikilink">mayor</a> from 1999 to 2006), there were further plans for the merger of some raions and revision of their boundaries, and the total number of raions had been planned to be decreased from 10 to 7. With the election of the new mayor-elect (<a href="Leonid_Chernovetskyi" title="wikilink">Leonid Chernovetsky</a>) in 2006, these plans were conducted.</p>

<h4 id="formal-subdivision">Formal subdivision</h4>
<p>Administratively, the city is divided into &quot;<a href="raion" title="wikilink">raions</a>&quot; (&quot;districts&quot;), which have their own <a href="local_government" title="wikilink">locally elected governments</a> with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs. Presently, there are 10 raions.</p>
<p><img src="Kiev_map_english.png" title="fig:The ten raions (boroughs) of Kiev" alt="The ten raions (boroughs) of Kiev" /> Municipal raions (districts) in the city include:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h4 id="informal-subdivision">Informal subdivision</h4>
<p>The <a href="Dnieper_River" title="wikilink">Dnieper River</a> naturally divides Kiev into the Right Bank and the Left Bank areas. Historically located on the western right bank of the river, the city expanded into the left bank only in the twentieth century. Most of the Kiev's attractions as well as the majority of business and governmental institutions are located at the right bank. The eastern Left Bank is predominantly residential. There are large industrial and green areas in both the Right Bank and the Left Bank.</p>
<p>Kiev is further informally divided into historical or territorial neighbourhoods, each housing from about 5,000 to 100,000 inhabitants.</p>
<h2 id="demographics">Demographics</h2>
<p><img src="Kiew_Zentrum.jpg" title="fig:Kiev skyline at dusk" alt="Kiev skyline at dusk" /> </p>
<p>According to the <a href="Ukrainian_Census_(2001)" title="wikilink">All-Ukrainian Census</a>, the population of Kiev in 2001 was 2,611,300.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The historic changes in population is shown in the side table. According to the census men accounted for 1,219,000 persons, or 46.7%, and women for 1,393,000 persons, or 53.3%. Comparing the results with the previous census (1989) shows the trend of <a href="population_ageing" title="wikilink">population ageing</a> which, while prevalent throughout the country, is partly offset in Kiev by the inflow of working age migrants. According to the census data, more than 130 nationalities and ethnic groups reside within the territory of Kiev. Ukrainians constitute the largest <a href="ethnic_group" title="wikilink">ethnic group</a> in Kiev, and they account for 2,110,800 people, or 82.2% of the population. <a href="Russians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russians</a> comprise 337,300 (13.1%), <a href="Jews" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jews</a> 17,900 (0.7%), <a href="Belarusians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belarusians</a> 16,500 (0.6%), <a href="Poles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poles</a> 6,900 (0.3%), <a href="Armenians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Armenians</a> 4,900 (0.2%), <a href="Azerbaijani_people" title="wikilink">Azerbaijanis</a> 2,600 (0.1%), <a href="Tatars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tatars</a> 2,500 (0.1%), <a href="Georgians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Georgians</a> 2,400 (0.1%), <a href="Moldovans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moldovans</a> 1,900 (0.1%).

<h3 id="sports">Sports</h3>

<p><img src="Kiev_stadium_1980.jpg" title="fig:The Olympic Stadium." alt="The Olympic Stadium." /> Kiev has many professional and amateur football clubs, including the <a href="FC_Dynamo_Kyiv" title="wikilink">Kyiv Dynamo</a>, <a href="FC_Arsenal_Kyiv" title="wikilink">Kyiv Arsenal</a> and <a href="FC_Obolon_Kyiv" title="wikilink">FC Obolon Kyiv</a> which play in the <a href="Ukrainian_Premier_League" title="wikilink">Ukrainian Premier League</a>.

<p>Public transportation in Kiev includes the <a href="rapid_transit" title="wikilink">metro</a> (underground), <a href="bus" title="wikilink">buses</a>, <a href="trolleybus" title="wikilink">trolleybuses</a>, <a href="tram" title="wikilink">trams</a> and <a href="funicular" class="uri" title="wikilink">funicular</a>. The publicly owned and operated <a href="Kiev_Metro" title="wikilink">Kiev Metro</a> system is the fastest, the most convenient and affordable network that covers most, but not all, of the city. The metro is continuously expanding towards the city limits to meet growing demand, while the other kinds of public transport are not that well maintained. In particular, the public <a href="bus" class="uri" title="wikilink">bus</a> service has an unreliable schedule. Public electric trolleybus and tram lines are more reliable, but have aged equipment and are underfunded. The historic <a href="Kiev_Tramway" title="wikilink">tram system</a>, which once was a well maintained and widely used method of transport, is now gradually being phased out in favor of buses and trolleybuses.</p>
<p>One unusual mode of public transportation Kiev has is the <a href="Kiev_Funicular" title="wikilink">funicular</a>, that climbs up the steep right bank of the <a href="Dnieper_River" title="wikilink">Dnieper River</a>. It transports 10,000&lt;U+2013&gt;15,000 passengers daily.</p>
<p><img src="Kiev_funicular._Lower_station_at_night.jpg" title="fig:Kiev Funicular&#39;s lower station" alt="Kiev Funicular&#39;s lower station" /> All public road transport in Kiev is operated by the united <em>Kyivpastrans</em><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> <a href="Municipality" title="wikilink">municipal</a> company. It is heavily subsidized by the city as large groups of passengers (pensioners, etc.) are granted free service on its lines. The Kiev public transport system uses a simple tariff system regardless of distance travelled: tickets for ground transportation must be purchased each time a vehicle boarded. Discount passes are available for grade school and higher education students. Pensioners use public transportation free. Monthly passes, which are sold at the price of 60 rides, are also available in all combinations of public transportation: metro, bus, trolley and tram. Recently, privately owned minibuses, <em><a href="marshrutka" title="wikilink">marshrutkas</a></em>, have appeared on Kiev streets. They provide good coverage of smaller residential streets and have convenient routes. Minibuses take fewer passengers, run faster, stop on demand and are more available, although with an increased frequency of accidents. Ticket price and itinerary of private minibuses are regulated by the city government, and the cost of one ride, while higher than on public buses, is still far lower than in Western Europe.</p>
<p>The <a href="Taxicab" title="wikilink">taxi</a> market in Kiev is expansive but not adequately regulated. In particular, the taxi fare per kilometer is not regulated. There is strong competition between private taxi companies. Many allow scheduling a pick-up by phone. Also, it is quite common for a local with a car (or even people from other parts of Ukraine) to provide taxi service on the <em>ad hoc</em> basis, generally by picking up people looking for a taxi by the roadside. <a href="Traffic_congestion" title="wikilink">Traffic jams</a> and lack of parking space are growing problems for taxi services in Kiev. Current regulations allow for parking on pavements, which pedestrians may find inconvenient.</p>

<p>Suburban transportation is provided by buses and short-range trains (<em><a href="elektrichka" title="wikilink">elektrichkas</a></em>). There are a few bus stations inside the city providing suburban transportation. Private minibuses (<em><a href="marshrutka" title="wikilink">marshrutkas</a></em>) provide faster and more frequent suburban service, currently winning the competition against large buses.</p>
<p><em>Elektrichkas</em> are serviced by the publicly owned <a href="Ukrainian_Railways" title="wikilink">Ukrzaliznytsia</a> company. The suburban train service is fast, and unbeatably safe in terms of traffic accidents. But the trains are not reliable, as they may fail significantly behind schedule, may not be safe in terms of crime, and the <em>elektrichka</em> cars are poorly maintained and are overcrowded in <a href="rush_hour" title="wikilink">rush hours</a>.</p>
<p>There are 5 <em>elektrichka</em> directions from Kiev:</p>

<p><a href="Ukrainian_Railways" title="wikilink">Railways</a> are Kiev&lt;U+2019&gt;s main mode of intercity transportation. The city has a developed railroad infrastructure including a long-distance passenger station, 6 cargo stations, depots, and repairing facilities. However, this system still fails to meet the demand for passenger service. Particularly, the <a href="Kiev_Passenger_Railway_Station" title="wikilink">Kiev Passenger Railway Station</a> is the city's only long-distance passenger terminal (<em>vokzal</em>).</p>

The international passenger terminal at Boryspil is small, yet modern, being expanded in 2006. There is a separate terminal for domestic flights within walking distance. Passengers flying to other countries from Ukraine usually travel through Boryspil, as other airports in Ukraine such as Donetsk, Simferopol, Odessa, provide very limited international connections.

<p><img src="Kiev_fortress_002_SHCH.jpg" title="fig:Kiev fortress" alt="Kiev fortress" /> Having lost their military importance in 20th century, buildings continued to be used as <a href="barracks" class="uri" title="wikilink">barracks</a>, storage and incarceration facilities. However, some of them played independent historical roles. The <em>Kosyi Kaponir</em> (&quot;Skew <a href="Caponier" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caponier</a>&quot;) became a <a href="prison" class="uri" title="wikilink">prison</a> for the political inmates in the 1900s&lt;U+2013&gt;1920s and was later turned into a <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet</a> museum.

The name <em>Zoloti Vorota</em> is also used for a nearby <a href="theatre" class="uri" title="wikilink">theatre</a> and a station of the <a href="Kiev_Metro" title="wikilink">Kiev Metro</a>. This gateway was one of three constructed by <a href="Yaroslav_I_the_Wise" title="wikilink">Yaroslav the Wise</a>, Prince of Kiev, in the mid-11th century. It was reputedly modelled on the <a href="Golden_Gate_(Constantinople)" title="wikilink">Golden Gate</a> of <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a>, from which it took its name. In 1240 it was partially destroyed by <a href="Batu_Khan" title="wikilink">Batu Khan</a>'s <a href="Golden_Horde" title="wikilink">Golden Horde</a>. It remained as a gate to the city (often used for ceremonies) through the 18th century, although it gradually fell into ruins. In 1832 the ruins were excavated and an initial survey for their conservation was undertaken. Further works in the 1970s added an adjacent pavilion, housing a museum of the gate. In the museum one can learn about the history of construction of the Golden gate as well as ancient Kiev. In 1982, the gate was completely reconstructed for the 1500th anniversary of Kiev, although there is no solid evidence as to what the original gates looked like. Some <a href="History_of_art" title="wikilink">art historians</a> called for this reconstruction to be demolished and for the ruins of the original gate to be exposed to public view. In 1989, with the expansion of the <a href="Kiev_Metro" title="wikilink">Kiev Metro</a>, the <a href="Zoloti_Vorota_(Kiev_Metro)" title="wikilink">Zoloti Vorota</a> station was opened nearby to serve the landmark. What makes it unique is that its architectural ensemble is very much based on the internal decorations of <a href="Architecture_of_Kievan_Rus" title="wikilink">ancient Ruthenian churches</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, <em>Kiev</em> is the traditional and most commonly used <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> name for the city,<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> but in 1995 the Ukrainian government adopted <em>Kyiv</em> as the mandatory <a href="romanization" class="uri" title="wikilink">romanization</a> for use in legislative and official acts.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>As a prominent city with a long history, its English name was subject to gradual evolution. The early English spelling was derived from <a href="Old_East_Slavic" title="wikilink">Old East Slavic</a> form <em>Kyjev&lt;U+044A&gt;</em> (<a href="Cyrillic_alphabet" title="wikilink">Cyrillic</a>: &lt;U+041A&gt;&lt;U+044A&gt;&lt;U+0131&gt;&lt;U+0454&gt;&lt;U+0432&gt;&lt;U+044A&gt;<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a>), derived from <a href="Kyi,_Schek_and_Khoryv" title="wikilink">Kyi</a> (&lt;U+041A&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0439&gt;), the <a href="Kyi,_Schek_and_Khoryv" title="wikilink">legendary founder of the city</a>.</p>
<p>Early English sources use various names, including <em>Kiou</em>, <em>Kiow</em>, <em>Kiew</em>, <em>Kiovia</em>. On one of the oldest English maps of the region, <em>Russiae, Moscoviae et Tartariae</em> published by <a href="Abraham_Ortelius" title="wikilink">Ortelius</a> (London, 1570) the name of the city is spelled <em>Kiou</em>. On the 1650 map by Guillaume de Beauplan, the name of the city is <em>Kiiow</em>, and the region was named <em>K&lt;U+00FF&gt;owia</em>. In the book <em>Travels</em>, by Joseph Marshall (London, 1772), the city is referred to as <em>Kiovia</em>.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> While the choice of these spellings have likely been influenced by the <a href="Polish_name" title="wikilink">Polish name</a> of the city () as until mid-seventeenth century the city was controlled by <a href="Crown_of_the_Kingdom_of_Poland" title="wikilink">Poland</a>, the name <em>Kiev</em>  that started to take hold at later times, likely originates on the basis of <a href="Russian_language" title="wikilink">Russian</a> orthography and pronunciation , during a time when Kiev was in the <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russian Empire</a> (since 1708 a centre of a <a href="Governorate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Governorate</a>).</p>
<p>In English, <em>Kiev</em> was used in print as early as in 1804 in the <a href="John_Cary" title="wikilink">John Cary</a>'s &quot;New map of Europe, from the latest authorities&quot; in &quot;Cary's new universal atlas&quot; published in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>. The English travelogue titled <em>New Russia: Journey from Riga to the Crimea by way of Kiev</em>, by Mary Holderness was published in 1823.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> By 1883, the <a href="Oxford_English_Dictionary" title="wikilink">Oxford English Dictionary</a> included <em>Kiev</em> in a quotation. <em>Kiev</em> is also based on the old Ukrainian language spelling of the city name and was used by Ukrainians and their ancestors from the time of <a href="Kievan_Rus&#39;" title="wikilink">Kievan Rus</a> until only about the last century.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> <img src="Kiev_on_1804_map.jpg" title="fig:A fragment from an 1804 John Cary&#39;s &quot;New map of Europe, from the latest authorities&quot; published in &quot;Cary&#39;s new universal atlas&quot;, London, 1808." alt="A fragment from an 1804 John Cary&#39;s &quot;New map of Europe, from the latest authorities&quot; published in &quot;Cary&#39;s new universal atlas&quot;, London, 1808." /></p>
<p><em>Kyiv</em> () is the <a href="Romanization" title="wikilink">romanized</a> version of the name of the city used in modern <a href="Ukrainian_language" title="wikilink">Ukrainian</a>. Starting from the twentieth century it has been used in English-language publications of the <a href="Ukrainian_diaspora" title="wikilink">Ukrainian diaspora</a> and in some academic publications concerning Ukraine. Following the independence in 1991, the Ukrainian government introduced <a href="Romanization_of_Ukrainian" title="wikilink">the national rules for transliteration of geographic names</a> from Ukrainian into English. According to the rules, the Ukrainian &lt;U+041A&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0457&gt;&lt;U+0432&gt; transliterates into <em>Kyiv</em>. This has established the use of the spelling <em>Kyiv</em> in all official documents issued by the governmental authorities since October 1995. The spelling is used by the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a>, all English-speaking foreign <a href="diplomatic_mission" title="wikilink">diplomatic missions</a>,<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> several international organizations,<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> <a href="Encarta" title="wikilink">Encarta encyclopedia</a>, and by some media, notably in <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a> and Ukraine.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> In October 2006, the United States federal government changed its official spelling of the city name to <em>Kyiv</em>, upon the recommendation of the US Board of Geographic Names.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> The British government has also started using Kyiv.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The alternate romanizations <em>Kyyiv</em> (BGN/PCGN transliteration) and <em>Kyjiv</em> (scholarly) are also in use in English-language atlases.
