The battle took place in the <a href="South_Pacific_Area" title="wikilink">South Pacific</a> between <a href="Rennell_Island" title="wikilink">Rennell Island</a> and <a href="Guadalcanal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guadalcanal</a> in the southern <a href="Solomon_Islands" title="wikilink">Solomon Islands</a>.</p>
<p>In the battle, <a href="Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> naval land-based <a href="torpedo" class="uri" title="wikilink">torpedo</a> <a href="bomber" title="wikilink">bombers</a>, seeking to provide protection for the impending evacuation of Japanese forces from Guadalcanal, made several attacks over two days on <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>' <a href="warship" title="wikilink">warships</a> operating as a <a href="task_force" title="wikilink">task force</a> south of Guadalcanal. In addition to approaching Guadalcanal with the objective of engaging any Japanese ships that might come into range, the U.S. task force was protecting an <a href="Allies_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">Allied</a> transport ship convoy that was carrying replacement <a href="troop" title="wikilink">troops</a> to Guadalcanal. As a result of the Japanese air attacks on the task force, one U.S. <a href="heavy_cruiser" title="wikilink">heavy cruiser</a> was sunk, a <a href="destroyer" class="uri" title="wikilink">destroyer</a> was heavily damaged, and the rest of the U.S. task force was forced to retreat from the southern Solomons area. Partly because of their success in turning back the U.S. task force in this battle, the Japanese were successful in evacuating their remaining troops from Guadalcanal by <a href="February_7" title="wikilink">February 7</a>, <a href="1943" class="uri" title="wikilink">1943</a>, leaving Guadalcanal in Allied hands and ending the battle for the island.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>On <a href="August_7" title="wikilink">August 7</a>, <a href="1942" class="uri" title="wikilink">1942</a>, Allied forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, <a href="Tulagi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tulagi</a>, and <a href="Florida_Islands" title="wikilink">Florida Islands</a> in the <a href="Solomon_Islands" title="wikilink">Solomon Islands</a>. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as <a href="Military_base" title="wikilink">bases</a> for threatening the <a href="materiel" title="wikilink">supply</a> routes between the U.S. and <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>, and to secure the islands as starting points for a <a href="Military_campaign" title="wikilink">campaign</a> with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rabaul</a> while also supporting the Allied <a href="New_Guinea_campaign" title="wikilink">New Guinea campaign</a>. The landings initiated the six-month-long <a href="Guadalcanal_campaign" title="wikilink">Guadalcanal campaign</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The last major attempt by the Japanese to drive Allied forces from Guadalcanal and Tulagi was defeated during the decisive <a href="Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal" title="wikilink">Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a> in early November 1942. Thereafter, the Japanese Navy was only able to deliver subsistence supplies and a few replacement troops to Japanese <a href="Japanese_Imperial_Army" title="wikilink">Army</a> forces on Guadalcanal. Because of the threat from Allied aircraft based at <a href="Honaira_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Henderson Field</a> on Guadalcanal, plus nearby U.S. <a href="aircraft_carriers" title="wikilink">aircraft carriers</a>, the Japanese delivered these supplies at night, usually by <a href="destroyer" class="uri" title="wikilink">destroyer</a> or <a href="submarine" class="uri" title="wikilink">submarine</a>, in operations the Allies called the &quot;<a href="Tokyo_Express" title="wikilink">Tokyo Express</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, these supplies and replacements were not enough to sustain Japanese troops on the island, who by <a href="December_7" title="wikilink">December 7</a>, <a href="1942" class="uri" title="wikilink">1942</a>, were losing about 50 men each day from malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground or air attacks.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> On <a href="December_12" title="wikilink">December 12</a>, the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned. Despite opposition from Japanese Army leaders, who still hoped that Guadalcanal could eventually be retaken from the Allies, Japan's <a href="Imperial_General_Headquarters" title="wikilink">Imperial General Headquarters</a>, with approval from the <a href="Emperor_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Emperor</a>, on <a href="December_31" title="wikilink">December 31</a>, <a href="1942" class="uri" title="wikilink">1942</a>, agreed to the evacuation of all Japanese forces from the island and establishment of a new line of defense for the Solomons on <a href="New_Georgia" title="wikilink">New Georgia</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>In front of this array of task forces was the troop convoy (Task Group (TG) 62.8), consisting of four transports and four destroyers.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Ahead of the troop convoy, between <a href="Rennell_Island" title="wikilink">Rennell Island</a> and Guadalcanal, was a close support group called <a href="Task_Force_18" title="wikilink">Task Force 18</a> (TF 18), under Rear Admiral <a href="Robert_C._Giffen" title="wikilink">Robert C.

The cruisers were aligned in two columns, spaced  apart. <em>Wichita</em>, <em>Chicago</em>, and <em>Louisville</em>, in that order, to <a href="starboard" class="uri" title="wikilink">starboard</a> and <em>Montpelier</em>, <em>Cleveland</em>, and <em>Columbia</em> to <a href="port" class="uri" title="wikilink">port</a>. The six destroyers were spread along a semicircle 3 kilometers (2 mi) ahead of the cruiser columns.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Giffen's force was being tracked by Japanese submarines, who reported on Giffen's location and movement to their naval headquarter's units.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Around mid-afternoon, based on the submarine's reports, 32 <a href="Mitsubishi_G4M" title="wikilink">G4M &quot;Betty&quot;</a> <a href="torpedo_bomber" title="wikilink">torpedo bombers</a> stationed at Rabaul and <a href="Kavieng" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kavieng</a> and staging through <a href="Munda_(Solomon_Islands)" title="wikilink">Munda</a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and <a href="Buka_Island" title="wikilink">Buka</a> airfields<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> in the Solomons, took off carrying torpedoes to attack Giffen's force.

<p><img src="RennellBattleMap.jpg" title="fig:300 px|thumb|left|Chart of Japanese air attack (dashed red line) on U.S. Task Force 18 (solid black line) between Rennell Island and Guadalcanal on the evening of January 29." alt="300 px|thumb|left|Chart of Japanese air attack (dashed red line) on U.S. Task Force 18 (solid black line) between Rennell Island and Guadalcanal on the evening of January 29." />At sunset, as TF 18 headed northwest 80 kilometers (50 mi) north of Rennell Island and 160 kilometers (100 mi) south of Guadalcanal, several of Giffen's ships detected unidentified aircraft on <a href="radar" class="uri" title="wikilink">radar</a> 100 kilometers (60 mi) west of their formation. Having previously insisted on absolute radio silence, Giffen gave no orders about what to do about the unidentified contacts, or any orders at all, for that matter.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> With the setting of the sun, TF 18's combat air patrol (<a href="Combat_air_patrol" title="wikilink">CAP</a>) from the two escort carriers returned to their ships for the night, leaving Giffen's ships without air cover.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The radar contacts were, in fact, the approaching 31 Japanese Betty torpedo bombers, who circled around to the south of TF 18 so that they could attack from the east, with the black backdrop of the eastern sky behind them. The Bettys split into two groups, with the first group of 16 bombers commencing their attacks on TF 18 at 19:19. In this attack, all of the first group of Betty's torpedoes missed, and one of the bombers was shot down by <a href="anti-aircraft_warfare" title="wikilink">anti-aircraft</a> fire from Giffen's ships.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Believing the attack was over, Giffen ordered his ships to cease zigzagging and to continue heading towards Guadalcanal on the same course and at the same speed. Meanwhile, other Japanese aircraft began dropping <a href="Flare_(pyrotechnic)" title="wikilink">flares</a> and floatlights to mark the course and speed of TF 18 in order to assist with the impending attack by the second group of Bettys.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>At 19:38, the second group of Bettys attacked, planting two torpedoes in <em>Chicago</em>, causing heavy damage and bringing the cruiser to a dead stop. One other torpedo hit <em>Wichita</em> but did not explode, and two of the Bettys were shot down by anti-aircraft fire. At 20:08, Giffen ordered his ships to reverse direction, to slow to , and to cease firing their anti-aircraft guns, which succeeded in concealing his ships from the Japanese aircraft, who all departed the area by 23:35.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In pitch darkness, <em>Louisville</em> managed to take the crippled <em>Chicago</em> under tow and slowly headed south, away from the battle area, escorted by the rest of TF 18.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

Although they were all chased away by the CAP, they were able to observe and report the position of <em>Chicago</em>. At 12:15, a force of 11 Bettys launched to attack the damaged U.S. cruiser. The U.S. ships knew the Bettys were coming, because of a warning report from an Australian <a href="Coastwatchers" title="wikilink">coastwatcher</a> in the Solomon Islands, with an estimated arrival time of 16:00. However, Halsey ordered the rest of the cruisers to leave <em>Chicago</em> behind and head for port at <a href="Efate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Efate</a>, in the <a href="Vanuatu" title="wikilink">New Hebrides</a>, which they did at 15:00, leaving behind six destroyers to protect <em>Chicago</em> and <em>Navajo</em>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>At 15:40, <em>Enterprise</em> was 69 kilometers (43 mi) away from <em>Chicago</em>, with ten of her <a href="fighter_aircraft" title="wikilink">fighters</a> forming a CAP over the damaged cruiser. At this time, four of the CAP fighters chased and shot-down a scout Betty bomber. At 15:54, radar on <em>Enterprise</em> detected the incoming flight of Bettys, and launched 10 more fighters to attack the Betty formation. The escort carriers, however, had difficulties in getting their aircraft launched, preventing them from joining in the attack on the Betty formation until the engagement was over.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="RennellBattleMap2.jpg" title="fig:300 px|thumb|left|Japanese aerial attack (dotted red line) on Chicago (yellow dot) on the morning of January 30. Black arrows are U.S. carrier fighter aircraft." alt="300 px|thumb|left|Japanese aerial attack (dotted red line) on Chicago (yellow dot) on the morning of January 30. Black arrows are U.S. carrier fighter aircraft." />At first the Bettys appeared to be trying to approach and attack <em>Enterprise</em> but turned towards <em>Chicago</em> after six <em>Enterprise</em> CAP fighters began to engage them. Four other CAP fighters chased the Bettys as they entered the anti-aircraft fire from <em>Chicago</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s escorting destroyers. In all, eight of the attacking Bettys were shot down by the CAP fighters or by anti-aircraft fire, but most of the bombers were able to drop their torpedoes before crashing.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>One torpedo hit the destroyer <a href="USS_La_Vallette_(DD-448)" title="wikilink">USS <em>La Vallette</em></a> in her forward engine room, killing 22 of her crew and causing heavy damage. <em>Chicago</em> was hit by four torpedoes, one forward of the bridge and three others in her engineering spaces. <em>Chicago</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s captain, Ralph O. Davis, ordered the ship to be abandoned, and the cruiser sank, stern first, 20 minutes later. <em>Navajo</em> and the escorting destroyers rescued 1,049 survivors from <em>Chicago</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s crew,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> but 62 of her crew died.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> A final attack force of Japanese Betty torpedo bombers failed to find the remaining U.S. ships. <em>Navajo</em> took <em>La Vallette</em> under tow, and all of the remaining ships of TF 18 were able to make it to port at Espiritu Santo without further incident.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p><img src="RennellJapanesePainting.jpg" title="fig:250 px|thumb|right|Japanese war art depicting the battle showing Betty bombers attacking burning U.S. warships." alt="250 px|thumb|right|Japanese war art depicting the battle showing Betty bombers attacking burning U.S. warships." />The Japanese widely publicized the results of the engagement, claiming to have sunk a &quot;battleship&quot; and &quot;three cruisers.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The U.S., on the other hand, tried to conceal the loss of <em>Chicago</em> from the public for some time, with Admiral <a href="Chester_Nimitz" title="wikilink">Chester Nimitz</a>, commander in chief of Allied Pacific forces, threatening to &quot;shoot&quot; any of his staff who leaked the loss of <em>Chicago</em> to the press. Halsey and Nimitz blamed Giffen for the defeat and stated so in Giffen's official performance report for the period.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The defeat and resulting recriminations do not appear to have affected Giffen's career too adversely; he continued to lead Allied battleship and cruiser task forces in the Pacific until 1944 and was later promoted to <a href="vice_admiral" title="wikilink">vice admiral</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>With Japanese air assets tied up in the battle with TF 18, the Allied transports were able to complete their mission of replacing the remaining Marine forces on Guadalcanal over the last two days in January. During this time, the other Allied task forces, including the two fleet carrier task forces, took station in the <a href="Coral_Sea" title="wikilink">Coral Sea</a>, in anticipation of an expected Japanese offensive in the southern Solomons<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>In reality, however, the Japanese were completing the secret evacuation of their remaining forces from Guadalcanal over three nights between <a href="February_2" title="wikilink">February 2</a> and <a href="February_7" title="wikilink">February 7</a>. With TF 18 forced to retreat, very few Allied naval forces were left in the immediate Guadalcanal area, allowing the Japanese to successfully retrieve all of their ground forces, and the Allies did not realize the evacuation was happening until it was over.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Many of these evacuated ground forces would play an important part in future battles between the Japanese and the Allies in the critical Solomon Islands campaign.</p>
