<p>The <strong>law school of Beirut</strong> (also known as the <strong>law school of Berytus</strong> and the <strong>school of Roman law at Berytus</strong>) was a center for the study of <a href="Roman_law" title="wikilink">Roman law</a> in <a href="classical_antiquity" title="wikilink">classical antiquity</a> located in <a href="Beirut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beirut</a>. It flourished under the patronage of the <a href="Roman_emperor" title="wikilink">Roman emperors</a> and functioned as the <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Roman Empire</a>'s preeminent center of jurisprudence until its destruction in 551 CE.</p>
<p>The law schools of the Roman Empire established organized repositories of imperial constitutions and institutionalized the study and practice of jurisprudence to relieve the busy imperial courts. The archiving of imperial constitutions facilitated the task of <a href="jurist" title="wikilink">jurists</a> in referring to legal precedents. The origins of the law school of Beirut are obscure. The earliest written mention of the school dates to 239 CE, when its reputation had already been established. The school attracted young, affluent Roman citizens, and its professors made major contributions to the <a href="Corpus_Juris_Civilis" title="wikilink">Codex of Justinian</a>. The school achieved such wide recognition throughout the Empire that Beirut was known as the &quot;Mother of Laws&quot;. Beirut was one of the few schools allowed to continue teaching jurisprudence when <a href="List_of_Byzantine_emperors" title="wikilink">Byzantine emperor</a> <a href="Justinian_I" title="wikilink">Justinian I</a> shut down other provincial law schools.</p>
<p>The course of study at Beirut lasted for five years and consisted in the revision and analysis of classical juridic texts and imperial constitutions, in addition to case discussions. Justinian took a personal interest in the teaching process, charging the bishop of Beirut, the governor of <a href="Phoenicia" title="wikilink">Phoenicia Maritima</a> and the teachers with discipline maintenance in the school.</p>
<p>The school's facilities were destroyed in the aftermath of a <a href="551_Beirut_earthquake" title="wikilink">massive earthquake</a> that hit the Phoenician coastline. It was moved to <a href="Sidon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sidon</a> but did not survive the <a href="Muslim_conquest_of_the_Levant" title="wikilink">Arab conquest</a> of 635 CE. Ancient texts attest that the school was located next to the ancient Anastasis church, vestiges of which lie beneath the <a href="Saint_George_Greek_Orthodox_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral</a> in <a href="Beirut_Central_District" title="wikilink">Beirut's historic center</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>As the guarantor of justice, the <a href="Roman_emperor" title="wikilink">Roman emperor</a> was expected to devote substantial amounts of time to judicial matters. He was the <a href="Executive_magistrates_of_the_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">chief magistrate</a> whose major prerogative (<em><a href="Ius" title="wikilink">jus</a></em>) was the ordering of all public affairs, for which he could demand assistance from anyone at any time.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>With legal appeals, petitions from subjects and judicial queries of magistrates and <a href="Roman_governor" title="wikilink">governors</a>, the emperors were careful to consult with the <a href="jurist" title="wikilink">jurists</a> (<em>iuris consulti</em>), who were usually secretaries drafted from the <a href="Roman_equestrian_order" title="wikilink">equestrian order</a>. From the reign of <a href="Augustus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Augustus</a> (27 BCE&lt;U+2013&gt;14 CE), jurists began compiling organized repositories of imperial <a href="edict" title="wikilink">edicts</a> (<em>constitutiones</em>), and juristic scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. Every new judicial decision was founded on archived <a href="Precedent" title="wikilink">legal precedents</a> and earlier deliberations. The edict repositories and the imperially sponsored juristic scholarship gave rise to the earliest law school system of the <a href="Western_world" title="wikilink">Western world</a>, aimed specifically at training professional jurists.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>During the reign of Augustus, <a href="Beirut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beirut</a> was established under the name <em>Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> (and granted the status of <em><a href="Ius_Italicum" title="wikilink">Ius Italicum</a></em>) as a <a href="Colonia_(Roman)" title="wikilink">colony</a> for <a href="Battle_of_Actium" title="wikilink">Battle of Actium</a> veterans from the fifth Macedonian and the third Gallic legions. It was chosen as a regional center instead of the more prominent Phoenician cities of <a href="Tyre,_Lebanon" title="wikilink">Tyre</a> and <a href="Sidon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sidon</a>, which had a history of belligerence against Rome.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

Italian jurist <a href="Scipione_Gentili" title="wikilink">Scipione Gentili</a>, however, attributed the school's foundation to Augustus, while nineteenth-century German theologian <a href="Karl_Hase" title="wikilink">Karl Hase</a> advocated its establishment shortly after the victory at Actium (31 BCE).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Adolf Friedrich Rudorff dated it to the reign of <a href="Hadrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hadrian</a>,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> while Franz Peter Bremer suggested that it opened around 200 CE, based on Thaumaturgus.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Theodor_Mommsen" title="wikilink">Theodor Mommsen</a> linked the establishment of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces. After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into <a href="Ancient_Greek" title="wikilink">Greek</a>, <a href="publishing" title="wikilink">published</a> and archived. This function was first recorded in 196 CE, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the <a href="Codex_Gregorianus" title="wikilink">Gregorian Codex</a>, but the city is thought to have served as a repository since earlier times.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The proximity of the repository to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult archived documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees&lt;U+2014&gt;an advantage that the law schools of <a href="Caesarea_Maritima" title="wikilink">Caesarea Maritima</a> and <a href="Alexandria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a> lacked.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The third-century emperors <a href="Diocletian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diocletian</a> and <a href="Maximian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maximian</a> issued constitutions exempting the students of the law school of Beirut from compulsory service in their hometowns.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In the fourth century, the Greek <a href="rhetoric" title="wikilink">rhetorician</a> <a href="Libanius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Libanius</a> reported that the school attracted young students from affluent families and deplored the school's instructional use of <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a>, which was gradually abandoned in favor of Greek in the course of the century.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> By the fifth century, Beirut had established its leading position and repute among the Empire's law schools; its teachers were highly regarded and played a chief role in the development of juristic learning in the East to the point that they were dubbed &quot;Oecumenical Masters&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> From 425 CE, the law school of <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a> became a rival center of law study and was the only school, along with Beirut's, to be maintained after <a href="Justinian_I" title="wikilink">Justinian I</a> closed those of Alexandria, Caesarea Maritima and <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a> in 529 CE<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> because their teachings contradicted with Christian faith.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>On July 9, 551, the Phoenician coastal cities were devastated by a high magnitude earthquake. In Beirut the earthquake was followed by a <a href="tsunami" class="uri" title="wikilink">tsunami</a> and a fire that obliterated the city. In the aftermath, 30,000 people lost their lives, including many students from abroad. Justinian allocated funds to rebuild Beirut, and the law school was temporarily moved to the southern Phoenician city of Sidon, pending reconstruction; the best teachers, however, moved to Constantinople. Misfortune hit Beirut again in 560 CE when a massive fire ravaged the recovering city. The law school was not reopened, and all prospect for its return was abandoned with the <a href="Muslim_conquest_of_the_Levant" title="wikilink">Arab conquest</a> in 635 CE.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>The study course at the law school of Beirut was restricted to <a href="Roman_law" title="wikilink">Roman law</a>; it did not cover the local laws of the province of Phoenicia.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Ancient texts provide an idea of the curriculum, the teaching method, the course languages and its duration.</p>
<h3 id="preparatory-studies">Preparatory studies</h3>
<p>Potential students were expected to have undergone grammar, rhetoric and encyclopedic sciences studies. Another prerequisite was the mastery of Greek and Latin, given that the classical juridic references and imperial constitutions used in the teaching program were written in Latin. The aspirants could pursue their preparatory studies in public schools or have private tutors.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Meister_von_San_Vitale_in_Ravenna_004.jpg" title="fig:Justinian I, the emperor who instigated the rewriting of Roman law" alt="Justinian I, the emperor who instigated the rewriting of Roman law" /> Little is known about the Beirut law school's curriculum before the fifth century. The <em><a href="Scholia_Sinaitica" title="wikilink">Scholia Sinaitica</a></em> and the <em><a href="Scholia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scholia</a></em> to the <em><a href="Basilika" title="wikilink">Basilica</a></em> provide glimpses of the school's <a href="teaching_method" title="wikilink">teaching method</a>, comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze juridic texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as <a href="Ulpian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ulpian</a>. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Jurisprudence was taught in Latin, even in the law schools of the East, but toward the end of the fourth and the beginning of the fifth century, Latin was supplanted by Greek at Beirut,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> which was the long-established <a href="lingua_franca" title="wikilink">lingua franca</a> of the eastern territories of the Roman Empire.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> A similar shift probably occurred at the school of Constantinople at about the same time.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>Omnem</em> constitution at the beginning of the <a href="Digest_(Roman_law)" title="wikilink">Digest</a> is the only source of information about the existing study system in the fifth century until the Justinian reforms of 533 CE.

Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth year in private study of Paulus' <em><a href="Responsa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Responsa</a></em>; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special nicknames: first year, <em>Dupondii</em>; second, <em>Edictales</em>; third, <em>Papinianistae</em>; fourth, <em>Lytae</em>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="professorial-body">Professorial body</h3>
<p>Ancient texts reveal the names and deeds of some of the most notable law professors at the Beirut school. The scarce sources include historical accounts, juridic works, anthologies, ancient correspondences and funerary inscriptions.</p>
<p><a href="Antioch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antioch</a>-based rhetoric teacher Libanius wrote many letters of correspondence to Domninus the Elder, a fourth-century law school professor. In 360 CE, Libanius invited Domninus to leave Beirut and teach with him at the rhetoric school of Antioch. Domninus apparently declined the offer, since later correspondence to him from Libanius, between 361 and 364 CE, served as recommendations for law school candidates.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>The most brilliant era of Beirut's law school, spanning the century between 400 and 500 CE, was known as the era of the &quot;Ecumenical Masters&quot; (Greek: &lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+1FC6&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt; &lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+1F30&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C5&gt;&lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03AD&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt; &lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03AC&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03BB&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;).

<p>While most of the law school's students are not remembered by history, ancient historians and sources recount the stories of some of those who were deemed notable and achieved fame.</p>
<p>According to <a href="Eusebius" title="wikilink">Eusebius of Caesarea</a>, <a href="Pamphilus_of_Caesarea" title="wikilink">Pamphilus of Caesarea</a> was born into a rich family in Beirut in the latter half of the third century and attended its law school.

He is celebrated as a martyr by both the <a href="Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic Church</a> and the <a href="Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>.

<p>Historically, Roman <em>stationes</em> or <em>auditoria</em>, where teaching was done, stood next to public libraries housed in temples. This arrangement was copied in the Roman colony at Beirut. The first mention of the school's premises dates to 350 CE,<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> but the description does not specify its location. In the fifth century, Zacharias Rhetor reported that the school stood next to the &quot;Temple of God&quot;, the description of which permitted its identification with the Byzantine Anastasis cathedral.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>

The influx of students was abundant and persistent because of the affluence, honor and secured employment offered by the profession.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> A degree in law became highly sought following an edict issued in 460 CE by Emperor <a href="Leo_I_the_Thracian" title="wikilink">Leo I</a>. The edict ordered that candidates for the bar of the Eastern <a href="praetorian_prefect" title="wikilink">praetorian prefecture</a> had to produce certificates of proficiency from the law teachers who instructed them at one of the recognized law schools of the Empire.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>The in-depth studies of the juridic classical works in Beirut, and later in Constantinople, conferred an unprecedented scientific dimension to jurisprudence; this academic movement gave rise to the minds behind Justinian's juridic reforms. As a result of the new understanding of the classical juridic texts, the imperial laws of the late fifth and early sixth centuries were clearer and more coherent than those of the early <a href="Postclassical_Era" title="wikilink">Postclassical Era</a>, according to legal historian George Mousourakis and other scholars.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a><a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>The school garnered accolades throughout its existence and was bestowed with the title <em>Berytus Nutrix Legum</em> (Beirut, Mother of Laws) by Eunapius, Libanius, Zacharias Rhetor and finally by Emperor Justinian.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> His 533 CE <em>Omnem</em> constitution read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These three works which we have composed we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities as well as in the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the third century on, the school tolerated Christian teachings, producing a number of students who would become influential church leaders and bishops, such as Pamphilus of Caesarea, Severus of Antioch and Aphian. Under Cyrillus, the first of the Ecumenical Masters, the Christian faith was consolidated as an integral element of the juristic training.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a><a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>Two professors from the law school of Beirut, Dorotheus and Anatolius, had such a repute for their wisdom and knowledge that they were especially praised by Justinian in the opening of his <em>Tanta</em> constitution. The emperor summoned both professors to assist his minister Tribonian in compiling the Codex of Justinian,<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> the Empire's body of civil laws issued between 529 and 534 CE. The <em>Tanta</em> passage reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... Dorotheus, an illustrious man, of great eloquence and qu&lt;U+00E6&gt;storian rank, whom, when he was engaged in delivering the law to students in the most brilliant city of Berytus,we, moved by his great reputation and renown, summoned to our presence and made to share in the work in question; again, Anatolius, an illustrious person, a magistrate, who, like the last, was invited to this work when acting as an exponent of law at Berytus, a man who came of an ancient stock, as both his father Leontius and his grandfather Eudoxius left behind them an excellent report in respect of legal learning...<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For centuries following its compilation, the work of Justinian's commission was studied and incorporated into the legal systems of different nations and has profoundly impacted the <a href="Byzantine_law" title="wikilink">Byzantine law</a> and the <a href="Western_law" title="wikilink">Western legal tradition</a>.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Peter Stein asserts that the texts of ancient Roman law have constituted &quot;a kind of legal supermarket, in which lawyers of different periods have found what they needed at the time.&quot;<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>

The <em>Ecloga</em> was a shortened and more philanthropic version of the Codex of Justinian, whose dispositions were more in tune with <a href="Christian_values" title="wikilink">Christian values</a>. It was written in Greek, since Latin had fallen into disuse, and its provisions continued to be applied in later centuries in the neighboring Balkan and Asia Minor regions, with surviving translations in <a href="Slavic_languages" title="wikilink">Slavic</a>, <a href="Armenian_language" title="wikilink">Armenian</a> and <a href="Arabic_language" title="wikilink">Arabic</a>.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a><a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a><a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Emperor <a href="Basil_I" title="wikilink">Basil I</a>, who ruled in the ninth century, issued the <em>Prochiron</em> and the <em>Epanagoge</em>, which were legal compilations invalidating parts of the <em>Ecloga</em> and restoring the Justinian laws.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a><a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> The <em>Prochiron</em> served as the basis for the legal writings of the twelfth-century first archbishop of Serbia, <a href="Saint_Sava" title="wikilink">Saint Sava</a>.

<p>The Codex of Justinian also had a great influence on Western law, particularly on the juridic history and tradition of western Europe and its American colonies. In Italy, a single complete copy of the Justinian Digest survived and laid forgotten until its rediscovery in 1070.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> In 1088, <a href="Irnerius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Irnerius</a>, a jurist and teacher of the liberal arts in <a href="Bologna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bologna</a>, was the first to teach the newly recovered Digest and the rest of Justinian's books. He and his successors explained the Roman laws to their students by means of glosses or explanatory notes written on the edges or between the text lines. The Roman legal concepts resulting from the studies of these &quot;<a href="glossator" title="wikilink">glossators</a>&quot; spread to the universities and law courts of Europe.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> The Roman law revival that started in Italy, during the Middle Ages, was taken up by France, the Netherlands and Germany in later centuries.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> The enactment of the German Civil Code in 1900 put an end to the application of extant forms of law derived from the Justinian codes in most European states.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
