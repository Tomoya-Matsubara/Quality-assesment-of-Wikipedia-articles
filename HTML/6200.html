<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>In 1945, after the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, shipping by private shipowners initially picked up again on a moderate scale under the direction of the <em>Arbeitsgemeinschaft Binnenschiffahrt K&lt;U+00F6&gt;rperschaft des &lt;U+00F6&gt;ffentlichen Rechts</em> with its head office in Berlin. On 27 October 1949 the state-owned firm of <em>Deutsche Schiffahrts- und Umschlagsbetriebs-Zentrale</em> (DSU) was established with its main branch in Stralsund. All the freight and passenger transport on the inland waterways of <a href="East_Germany" title="wikilink">East Germany</a> was transferred to this company.</p>
<p>Founded on 1 January 1957, the <a href="Volkseigener_Betrieb" title="wikilink">VEB</a> passenger shipping company in Stralsund, <em>Wei&lt;U+00DF&gt;e Flotte</em>, with its head office in Stralsund took over the overwhelming majority of excursion and scheduled services along the entire Baltic Sea coast. This company initially had just eleven staff and another 17 employees as well as 10 motor vessels, with a total seating of 1,511, in its first year of operations.</p>
<p>Over the years, branches were set up along the Baltic coast, the ships were modernized and the number of staff increased. Amongst the services operated at that time were <a href="excursion" title="wikilink">excursions</a> were to <a href="Gedser" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gedser</a>, <a href="Fehmarn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fehmarn</a> and <a href="M&lt;U+00F8&gt;n" class="uri" title="wikilink">M&lt;U+00F8&gt;n</a>, <a href="round_trip" title="wikilink">round trips</a> around <a href="R&lt;U+00FC&gt;gen" class="uri" title="wikilink">R&lt;U+00FC&gt;gen</a> and <a href="Hiddensee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hiddensee</a>, ocean crossings and harbour cruises. After extensive renovations to the ships of the &quot;White Fleet&quot; in 1958/59 and the addition of a ferry service to <a href="Altef&lt;U+00E4&gt;hr" class="uri" title="wikilink">Altef&lt;U+00E4&gt;hr</a>, e.g. with the <em>Stralsunder</em>, the number of ships at the beginning of 1959 increased to 17 vessels with a total of 2,488 seats. Three years later, the fleet of passenger ships rose to 23 through the acquisition of the <em>Genossenschaftsreederei Hiddensee</em> of <a href="Hiddensee" title="wikilink">Vitte</a>. Now a total of 3,251 seats were available. In 1961 two <a href="hydrofoil" title="wikilink">hydrofoils</a>, the TF 10-1 and TF 10-2 joined the <em>Wei&lt;U+00DF&gt;e Flotte</em> from <a href="Ro&lt;U+00DF&gt;lau_(Elbe)" title="wikilink">Ro&lt;U+00DF&gt;lau</a>, and were assigned to services between <a href="Warnem&lt;U+00FC&gt;nde" class="uri" title="wikilink">Warnem&lt;U+00FC&gt;nde</a> and <a href="Rostock" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rostock</a>-Kabutzenhof. By the end of 1963, the <em>Wei&lt;U+00DF&gt;e Flotte</em> employed 36 passenger ships with 4,740 seats and two freighters were employed on a total of 44 scheduled services.</p>
<p>In 1974, the <em>Wei&lt;U+00DF&gt;e Flotte</em> was further modernized with the purchase of three hydrofoils of the Kometa-M type. The boats, which had been built in the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> at the <a href="shipyard" class="uri" title="wikilink">shipyard</a> of Poti (Grusinische SSR), were selected for fast services on the Stralsund - <a href="Sassnitz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sassnitz</a> - <a href="Szczecin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Szczecin</a> or Rostock - <a href="Wismar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wismar</a> lines. With a speed of 32 <a href="knot_(unit)" title="wikilink">knots</a> (60 km/h), these boats needed only about four hours, for example, for the route from Stralsund via Sassnitz to <a href="Swinoujscie" class="uri" title="wikilink">Swinoujscie</a> and were thus much faster than the <a href="cruise_liner" title="wikilink">cruise liners</a>.</p>
<p>With a fleet of three hydrofoils, 31 passenger ships, seven ferries, two freighters and a ferry unit (<em>F&lt;U+00E4&gt;hrschubeinheit</em>) for heavy goods vehicles, the <em>Wei&lt;U+00DF&gt;e Flotte</em> transported 4.7 million passengers on 85 routes in 1989.</p>
<p>In 1990 the <em>Wei&lt;U+00DF&gt;e Flotte</em> was privatized and taken over by the shipping association of <em>F&lt;U+00F6&gt;rde Reederei Seetouristik</em> from <a href="Flensburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Flensburg</a>. The traditional name of <em>Wei&lt;U+00DF&gt;e Flotte</em> remained unchanged. All the old ships were sold and replaced with new, more modern and more comfortable ships.</p>
<p>The president of the district council of <a href="R&lt;U+00FC&gt;gen" class="uri" title="wikilink">R&lt;U+00FC&gt;gen</a>, Gesine Skrepski, opened a new jetty for the <a href="Wittow_Ferry" title="wikilink">Wittow Ferry</a> in 1994.</p>
<p>In 1995, the <em>Reederei Hiddensee</em>, a subsidiary of the <em>Wei&lt;U+00DF&gt;e Flotte</em>, was founded. The <em>Reederei Hiddensee</em> operates all the regular services from <a href="Zingst" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zingst</a>, <a href="Wiek_(R&lt;U+00FC&gt;gen)" title="wikilink">Wiek</a>, Stralsund and <a href="Schaprode" class="uri" title="wikilink">Schaprode</a> to the island of <a href="Hiddensee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hiddensee</a>. Through the establishment of <em>Reederei Hiddensee</em> the area of operations of the <em>Wei&lt;U+00DF&gt;e Flotte</em> expanded to include ferry services (Glewitz - Stahlbrode, Warnem&lt;U+00FC&gt;nde - Hohe D&lt;U+00FC&gt;ne, Wittow Nord - Wittow-S&lt;U+00FC&gt;d) and excursions on the Baltic Sea.</p>
