<p><strong>KOI-55.01</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (sometimes listed as <strong>KOI-55 b</strong>) is a <a href="terrestrial_planet" title="wikilink">terrestrial planet</a> discovered orbiting the <a href="white_dwarf" title="wikilink">post-red-giant star</a> <a href="KOI-55" class="uri" title="wikilink">KOI-55</a>. It orbits around its host along with another planet, <a href="KOI-55_c" title="wikilink">KOI-55.02</a>, and this planet, like KOI-55.01, has a very close orbit to its host star. The planet completes one orbit around its star in just 5.76 hours, to date the shortest orbital period of any exoplanetary system yet discovered.</p>
<p>According to the main author of the paper in <em><a href="Nature_(journal)" title="wikilink"> Nature</a></em> which announced the discovery of the two planets, Stephane Charpinet, the two planets &quot;probably plunged deep into the star&lt;U+2019&gt;s envelope during the red giant phase, but survived.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, this is not the first sighting of planets orbiting a dead star - numerous <a href="pulsar_planets" title="wikilink">pulsar planets</a> have been observed, but no planet has been found with such a short period around any star, whether or not on the <a href="main_sequence" title="wikilink">main sequence</a>.</p>

<p>The two planets were most likely <a href="gas_giants" title="wikilink">gas giants</a> which spiraled inward toward their host star, which subsequently became a red giant, vaporizing much of the planets except for their rocky cores, which we today observe as terrestrial planets orbiting a white dwarf.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> According to the <a href="Extrasolar_Planets_Encyclopedia" title="wikilink">Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia</a>, the star has been a white dwarf for about .<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
