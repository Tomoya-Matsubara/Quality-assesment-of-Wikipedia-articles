<p>A 2000 <a href="systematic_review" title="wikilink">systematic review</a> found that water fluoridation was <a href="Association_(statistics)" title="wikilink">statistically associated</a> with a decreased proportion of children with cavities (the <a href="median" class="uri" title="wikilink">median</a> of <a href="mean" class="uri" title="wikilink">mean</a> decreases was 14.6%, the <a href="Range_(statistics)" title="wikilink">range</a> &lt;U+2212&gt;5 to 64%), and with a decrease in decayed, <a href="Tooth_loss" title="wikilink">missing</a>, and <a href="Dental_restoration" title="wikilink">filled</a> <a href="primary_teeth" title="wikilink">primary teeth</a> (the median of mean decreases was 2.25 teeth, the range 0.5&lt;U+2013&gt;4.4 teeth),<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> which is roughly equivalent to preventing 40% of cavities.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> The review found that the evidence was of moderate quality: many studies did not attempt to reduce <a href="observer_bias" title="wikilink">observer bias</a>, control for <a href="confounding_factor" title="wikilink">confounding factors</a>, report variance measures, or use appropriate analysis. Although no major differences between natural and artificial fluoridation were apparent, the evidence was inadequate to reach a conclusion about any differences.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Fluoride also prevents cavities in adults of all ages. There are fewer studies in adults however, and the design of water fluoridation studies in adults is inferior to that of studies of self- or clinically applied fluoride. A 2007 <a href="meta-analysis" class="uri" title="wikilink">meta-analysis</a> found that water fluoridation prevented an estimated 27% of cavities in adults (95% <a href="confidence_interval" title="wikilink">confidence interval</a> [CI] 19&lt;U+2013&gt;34%), about the same fraction as prevented by exposure to any delivery method of fluoride (29% average, 95% CI: 16&lt;U+2013&gt;42%).<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> A 2002 systematic review found strong evidence that water fluoridation is effective at reducing overall tooth decay in communities.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>Most countries in Europe have experienced substantial declines in cavities without the use of water fluoridation.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> For example, in Finland and Germany, tooth decay rates remained stable or continued to decline after water fluoridation stopped. Fluoridation may be useful in the U.S. because unlike most European countries, the U.S. does not have school-based dental care, many children do not visit a dentist regularly, and for many U.S. children water fluoridation is the prime source of exposure to fluoride.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> The effectiveness of water fluoridation can vary according to circumstances such as whether preventive dental care is free to all children.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>

<p>Fluoride's adverse effects depend on total fluoride dosage from all sources. At the commonly recommended dosage, the only clear adverse effect is <a href="dental_fluorosis" title="wikilink">dental fluorosis</a>, which can alter the appearance of children's teeth during <a href="tooth_development" title="wikilink">tooth development</a>; this is mostly mild and is unlikely to represent any real effect on aesthetic appearance or on public health.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The critical period of exposure is between ages one and four years, with the risk ending around age eight. Fluorosis can be prevented by monitoring all sources of fluoride, with fluoridated water directly or indirectly responsible for an estimated 40% of risk and other sources, notably toothpaste, responsible for the remaining 60%.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Compared to water naturally fluoridated at 0.4 mg/L, fluoridation to 1 mg/L is estimated to cause additional fluorosis in one of every 6 people (95% CI 4&lt;U+2013&gt;21 people), and to cause additional fluorosis of aesthetic concern in one of every 22 people (95% CI 13.6&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+221E&gt; people). Here, <em>aesthetic concern</em> is a term used in a standardized scale based on what adolescents would find unacceptable, as measured by a 1996 study of British 14-year-olds.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> In many industrialized countries the <a href="prevalence" class="uri" title="wikilink">prevalence</a> of fluorosis is increasing even in unfluoridated communities, mostly because of fluoride from swallowed toothpaste.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> A 2009 systematic review indicated that fluorosis is associated with consumption of <a href="infant_formula" title="wikilink">infant formula</a> or of water added to reconstitute the formula, that the evidence was distorted by <a href="publication_bias" title="wikilink">publication bias</a>, and that the evidence that the formula's fluoride caused the fluorosis was weak.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> In the U.S. the decline in tooth decay was accompanied by increased fluorosis in both fluoridated and unfluoridated communities; accordingly, fluoride has been reduced in various ways worldwide in infant formulas, children's toothpaste, water, and fluoride-supplement schedules.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>Fluoridation has little effect on risk of <a href="bone_fracture" title="wikilink">bone fracture</a> (broken bones); it may result in slightly lower fracture risk than either excessively high levels of fluoridation or no fluoridation.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> There is no clear association between fluoridation and <a href="cancer" class="uri" title="wikilink">cancer</a> or deaths due to cancer, both for cancer in general and also specifically for <a href="bone_cancer" title="wikilink">bone cancer</a> and <a href="osteosarcoma" class="uri" title="wikilink">osteosarcoma</a>.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a><a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Other adverse effects lack sufficient evidence to reach a confident conclusion.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> A Finnish study published in 1997 showed that fear that water is fluoridated may have a psychological effect with a large variety of symptoms, regardless of whether the water is actually fluoridated.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p>Fluoride can occur naturally in water in concentrations well above recommended levels, which can have <a href="Fluoride_poisoning#Chronic_toxicity" title="wikilink">several long-term adverse effects</a>, including severe dental fluorosis, <a href="skeletal_fluorosis" title="wikilink">skeletal fluorosis</a>, and weakened bones.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> The World Health Organization recommends a guideline maximum fluoride value of 1.5 mg/L as a level at which fluorosis should be minimal.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>In rare cases improper implementation of water fluoridation can result in overfluoridation that causes outbreaks of acute <a href="fluoride_poisoning" title="wikilink">fluoride poisoning</a>, with symptoms that include <a href="nausea" class="uri" title="wikilink">nausea</a>, <a href="vomiting" class="uri" title="wikilink">vomiting</a>, and <a href="diarrhea" class="uri" title="wikilink">diarrhea</a>. Three such outbreaks were reported in the U.S. between 1991 and 1998, caused by fluoride concentrations as high as 220 mg/L; in the 1992 Alaska outbreak, 262 people became ill and one person died.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> In 2010, approximately 60 gallons of fluoride were released into the water supply in <a href="Asheboro,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Asheboro, North Carolina</a> in 90 minutes&lt;U+2014&gt;an amount that was intended to be released in a 24-hour period.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>

<p>The effect of water fluoridation on the natural environment has been investigated, and no adverse effects have been established.

Fluoride mouthwash and gel are about as effective as fluoride toothpaste; fluoride varnish prevents about 45% of cavities.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> By comparison, brushing with a nonfluoride toothpaste has little effect on cavities.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
<p>The effectiveness of <a href="salt" class="uri" title="wikilink">salt</a> fluoridation is about the same as that of water fluoridation, if most salt for human consumption is fluoridated. Fluoridated salt reaches the consumer in salt at home, in meals at school and at large kitchens, and in bread. For example, Jamaica has just one salt producer, but a complex public water supply; it started fluoridating all salt in 1987, achieving a notable decline in cavities. Universal salt fluoridation is also practiced in Colombia and the Swiss <a href="Canton_of_Vaud" title="wikilink">Canton of Vaud</a>; in France and Germany fluoridated salt is widely used in households but unfluoridated salt is also available, giving consumers choice about fluoride. Concentrations of fluoride in salt range from 90 to 350 mg/kg, with studies suggesting an optimal concentration of around 250 mg/kg.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Milk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Milk</a> fluoridation is practiced by the Borrow Foundation in some parts of Bulgaria, Chile, Peru, Russia, Macedonia, Thailand and the UK.

For example, milk-powder fluoridation is used in rural Chilean areas where water fluoridation is not technically feasible.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> These programs are aimed at children, and have neither targeted nor been evaluated for adults.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> A 2005 systematic review found insufficient evidence to support the practice, but also concluded that studies suggest that fluoridated milk benefits schoolchildren, especially their permanent teeth.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>

<p>The relationship between fluoride and teeth has been studied since the early 19th century. By 1850, investigators had established that fluoride occurs with varying concentrations in teeth, bone, and drinking water. By 1900, they had speculated that fluoride would protect against tooth decay, proposed supplementing the diet with fluoride, and observed mottled tooth enamel (now called dental fluorosis) without knowing the cause.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a></p>
<p>The history of water fluoridation can be divided into three periods. The first () was research into the cause of a form of mottled tooth enamel called the Colorado brown stain. The second (c. 1933&lt;U+2013&gt;1945) focused on the relationship between fluoride concentrations, fluorosis, and tooth decay, and established that moderate levels of fluoride prevent cavities. The third period, from 1945 on, focused on adding fluoride to community water supplies.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a></p>
<p>The foundation of water fluoridation in the U.S. was the research of the dentist Frederick McKay. McKay spent thirty years investigating the cause of what was then known as the Colorado brown stain, which produced mottled but also cavity-free teeth; with the help of <a href="G.V._Black" title="wikilink">G.V. Black</a> and other researchers, he established that the cause was fluoride.<ref>Colorado brown stain:</p>

<p></ref> The first report of a statistical association between the stain and lack of tooth decay was made by UK dentist Norman Ainsworth in 1925. In 1931, an <a href="Alcoa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alcoa</a> chemist, H.V. Churchill, concerned about a possible link between <a href="aluminum" class="uri" title="wikilink">aluminum</a> and staining, analyzed water from several areas where the staining was common and found that fluoride was the common factor.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a></p>

<p>In the 1930s and early 1940s, <a href="H._Trendley_Dean" title="wikilink">H.

Other studies found no other significant adverse effects even in areas with fluoride levels as high as 8 mg/L.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> To test the hypothesis that adding fluoride would prevent cavities, Dean and his colleagues conducted a <a href="controlled_experiment" title="wikilink">controlled experiment</a> by fluoridating the water in <a href="Grand_Rapids,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Grand Rapids, Michigan</a>, starting January 25, 1945.

<p>Fluoridation became an official policy of the <a href="U.S._Public_Health_Service" title="wikilink">U.S. Public Health Service</a> by 1951, and by 1960 water fluoridation had become widely used in the U.S., reaching about 50 million people.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a> By 2006, 69.2% of the U.S. population on public water systems were receiving fluoridated water, amounting to 61.5% of the total U.S. population; 3.0% of the population on public water systems were receiving naturally occurring fluoride.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> In some other countries the pattern was similar. New Zealand, which led the world in per-capita sugar consumption and had the world's worst teeth, began fluoridation in 1953, and by 1968 fluoridation was used by 65% of the population served by a piped water supply.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> Fluoridation was introduced into Brazil in 1953, was regulated by federal law starting in 1974, and by 2004 was used by 71% of the population.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> In the Republic of Ireland, fluoridation was legislated in 1960, and after a constitutional challenge the two major cities of Dublin and Cork began it in 1964;<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> fluoridation became required for all sizeable public water systems and by 1996 reached 66% of the population.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> In other locations, fluoridation was used and then discontinued: in <a href="Kuopio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kuopio</a>, Finland, fluoridation was used for decades but was discontinued because the school dental service provided significant fluoride programs and the cavity risk was low, and in <a href="Basel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Basel</a>, Switzerland, it was replaced with fluoridated salt.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a></p>
<p>McKay's work had established that fluorosis occurred before <a href="tooth_eruption" title="wikilink">tooth eruption</a>. Dean and his colleagues assumed that fluoride's protection against cavities was also pre-eruptive, and this incorrect assumption was accepted for years. By 2000, however, the topical effects of fluoride (in both water and toothpaste) were well understood, and it had become known that a constant low level of fluoride in the mouth works best to prevent cavities.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a></p>
