<p>The <strong><em>Liber Eliensis</em></strong> (sometimes <strong><em>Historia Eliensis</em></strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> or <strong><em>Book of Ely</em></strong>) is a 12th-century English chronicle and history, written in <a href="medieval_Latin" title="wikilink">Latin</a>. Composed in three books, it was written at <a href="Ely_Abbey" title="wikilink">Ely Abbey</a> on the island of <a href="Ely,_Cambridgeshire" title="wikilink">Ely</a> in the <a href="The_Fens" title="wikilink">fenlands</a> of eastern <a href="Cambridgeshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cambridgeshire</a>. Ely Abbey became the <a href="Ely_Cathedral" title="wikilink">cathedral</a> of a newly formed <a href="Diocese_of_Ely" title="wikilink">bishopric</a> in 1109. Traditionally the author of the anonymous work has been given as Richard or Thomas, two monks at Ely, one of whom, Richard, has been identified with an official of the monastery, but some historians hold that neither Richard nor Thomas was the author.</p>
<p>The <em>Liber</em> covers the period from the founding of the abbey in 673 until the middle of the 12th century, building on a number of earlier historical works. It incorporates documents and stories of <a href="hagiography" title="wikilink">saints' lives</a> and is a typical example of a kind of local history produced during the latter part of the 12th century, similar to a number of books written at other English monasteries. The longest of the contemporary local histories, it describes the devastation caused by the disorders during the reign of King <a href="Stephen,_King_of_England" title="wikilink">Stephen</a> as well an account of the career of <a href="Nigel_of_Ely" title="wikilink">Nigel</a>, the <a href="Bishop_of_Ely" title="wikilink">Bishop of Ely</a> from 1133 to 1169, and his disputes with King Stephen. Other themes are the miracles worked by the monastery's patron saint, <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelthryth" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelthryth</a>, and the gifts of land to Ely.</p>
<p>The two surviving complete manuscripts of the work are complemented by a number of partial manuscripts. A printed version of the Latin text appeared in 1963 and an English translation was published in 2005, although extracts had appeared in print earlier. The <em>Liber Eliensis</em> is an important source of historical information for the region and period it covers, and particularly for the abbey and bishopric of Ely.</p>

<p>The <em>Liber Eliensis</em> was written at Ely Abbey, which became <a href="Ely_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Ely Cathedral</a> when it was converted into a bishopric in 1109.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The historian Elisabeth van Houts believes that it was written in two stages: first under Bishop <a href="Hervey_le_Breton" title="wikilink">Hervey le Breton</a>, in office from 1109 to 1133; and continued under Bishop <a href="Geoffrey_Ridel_(bishop_of_Ely)" title="wikilink">Geoffrey Ridel</a>, who served from 1173 to 1189. For van Houts, the first stage was the translation of an <a href="Old_English" title="wikilink">Old English</a> work into Latin, commissioned by Bishop Hervey. The rest of the work, van Houts argues, was composed in the 1170s.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> However, E. O. Blake, who edited the first Latin printing of the work, concludes that the <em>Liber</em> was probably composed in three parts, based on its contents; the first book of the <em>Liber</em> was begun after 1131, when one of the sources used in the <em>Liber</em> was completed. The second has a preface apologising for the delay in its completion, and could not have been started before 1154, as it records events from that year. The third and final book was completed between 1169, when Bishop Nigel died and whose death is mentioned in the book, and 1174, when a new bishop was appointed. As there is no mention of Nigel's replacement, Blake states that this suggests that book three was finished before the new bishop took office.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Traditionally the work was ascribed to either Thomas or Richard, two monks of Ely mentioned in the text.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The historian <a href="Antonia_Gransden" title="wikilink">Antonia Gransden</a> is inclined to believe that the work is by Richard, who is usually identified with the Richard who was recorded as sub-prior and <a href="prior" class="uri" title="wikilink">prior</a> of Ely, holding the latter office from 1177 until some time between 1189 and 1194.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Blake thinks that Richard was the author, but he considers the evidence to be inconclusive.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Janet Fairweather, a <a href="classicist" class="uri" title="wikilink">classicist</a> and a recent translator of the <em>Liber</em>, suggests that it may have been written by someone other than the traditional candidates.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Whoever the author, the <em>Liber</em> specifically states that it was written at the bidding of some members of the monastic community at Ely.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>Liber</em> is one of a number of monastic histories written during the middle and later 12th century, when a number of monasteries in northern and southern England produced works devoted to recording the histories of their religious houses and local areas. In the south, these included the <em><a href="Historia_Ecclesie_Abbendonensis" title="wikilink">Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis</a></em> of <a href="Abingdon_Abbey" title="wikilink">Abingdon Abbey</a>, the <em><a href="Chronicon_Abbatiae_Rameseiensis" title="wikilink">Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis</a></em> of <a href="Ramsey_Abbey" title="wikilink">Ramsey Abbey</a>, the <em><a href="Chronicon_Angliae_Petriburgense" title="wikilink">Chronicon Angliae Petriburgense</a></em> of <a href="Peterborough_Abbey" title="wikilink">Peterborough Abbey</a>, a history of the <a href="Episcopal_see" title="wikilink">see</a> of <a href="Diocese_of_Bath_and_Wells" title="wikilink">Bath and Wells</a>, and the <em><a href="Chronicon_Monasterii_de_Bello" title="wikilink">Chronicon Monasterii de Bello</a></em> of <a href="Battle_Abbey" title="wikilink">Battle Abbey</a>. The northern histories record the <a href="foundation_stories" title="wikilink">foundation stories</a> of the various <a href="Cistercian_Order" title="wikilink">Cistercian</a> houses in the north, along with other information relating to those houses. Those from the south, including the <em>Liber Eliensis</em>, mainly concern themselves with the various controversies involving their respective religious houses. The northern histories are less concerned with controversy, and overall are more prone to <a href="hagiography" class="uri" title="wikilink">hagiography</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="sources">Sources</h2>
<p>To a large extent the work is composite; that is, it is a compilation borrowing or at least using earlier sources. These include the early medieval writer <a href="Bede" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bede</a>'s <em><a href="Historia_ecclesiastica_gentis_Anglorum" title="wikilink">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</a></em>, a chronicle that was associated with Bede's <em><a href="De_temporum_ratione" title="wikilink">De temporum ratione</a></em>, the <em><a href="Chronicon_ex_chronicis" title="wikilink">Chronicon ex chronicis</a></em>, and <a href="William_of_Poitiers" title="wikilink">William of Poitiers</a>' <em>Gesta Guillelmi II ducis Normannorum</em>.

<p>Works more directly related to Ely were also used. The primary one of these works was Bishop <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold_of_Winchester" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold of Winchester</a>'s <em>Libellus</em>, large parts of which were copied into the <em>Liber Eliensis</em>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Also incorporated into the <em>Liber</em> was an earlier <em>Vita</em>, or saints' life, on &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelthryth, the founder and first abbess of Ely.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> A work on the benefactors of the abbey was also used,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and the material from three surviving <a href="cartulary" title="wikilink">cartularies</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> These documents were translated from their original Old English into Latin by the compiler.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Another source, as related in the <em>Liber</em> itself, was a work about <a href="Hereward" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hereward</a> written by a brother monk known as Richard. Modern historians have identified it with the <em><a href="Gesta_Herwardi" title="wikilink">Gesta Herwardi</a></em> known from a 13th-century manuscript. It is, however, unclear whether the compiler of the <em>Liber</em> used the exact text of the <em>Gesta</em> as it has come down to us, or a different, earlier manuscript.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Some of these sources may originally have been oral works. A number of the stories in the narrative parts of the <em>Liber</em> resemble Scandinavian sagas, including the story about King <a href="Cnut_the_Great" title="wikilink">Cnut</a> visiting the monastery and singing an Anglo-Saxon song to the assembled monks. It is possible that the information on Hereward and Byrhtnoth originally came from orally transmitted tales that were written down.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>The work is traditionally divided into three books. Along with the history in Book I the first section also contains a prologue and a preface. It discusses the founding of the Abbey of Ely and the background of the foundress, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelthryth. The first book also deals with the history of the abbey and its abbesses until the Danish invasions of the 9th century. A description of the destruction of the abbey by the Danes and of King <a href="Edgar_the_Peaceable" title="wikilink">Edgar's</a> (reigned 959&lt;U+2013&gt;975) rule concludes the book.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The second book, Book II, begins with the restoration of the abbey during Edgar's reign, under Bishop &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold. Accounts of the subsequent abbots until the last, Richard, are included in Book II, as well as numerous charters and other documents.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The final book, Book III, contains information on the conversion of the abbey to a bishopric, and on the first few bishops; it concludes with a description of the martyrdom of <a href="Thomas_Becket" title="wikilink">Thomas Becket</a>. Interspersed with the historical narrative are a number of documents and charters relating to the bishops.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The work also depicts the devastations caused by the <a href="The_Anarchy" title="wikilink">disorders</a> during King <a href="Stephen_of_England" title="wikilink">Stephen's</a> (d. 1154) reign. The chronicler states that when the harvest failed this combined with the pillaging of the area to produce a famine. The work describes the area around the abbey for  as being filled with unburied corpses, and that the price of a bushel of grain rose to 200 <a href="penny_(English_coin)" title="wikilink">pence</a>. The long descriptions of <a href="Nigel_of_Ely" title="wikilink">Nigel of Ely's</a> disputes with King Stephen lead to a discussion of the <a href="Battle_of_Lincoln_(1141)" title="wikilink">Battle of Lincoln</a> and other matters not directly related to Ely. The <em>Liber</em> gives a detailed account of Nigel's career, although in general the chronicle's author favours Stephen over his own bishop. The ascension of King <a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry II</a> to the English throne is considered to be an excellent event, and the <em>Liber</em> praises the new king.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>An important part of the work was devoted to the miracles and glorification of Ely's patroness, Saint &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelthryth. The very beginning of the work incorporates an earlier <em>Vita</em>, or <em>Life</em>, of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelthryth, which resembles the <em>Vitae</em> of other saints written by Goscelin in the 11th century; Goscelin is known to have visited Ely.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The work may have helped to increase the number of pilgrims visiting Ely, as well as enabling the monks to better explain the history of earlier donations to the abbey. Many of the gifts to the abbey church are described, such as the altar cloth donated by Queen <a href="Emma_of_Normandy" title="wikilink">Emma</a> (d. 1052), wife of both <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred_the_Unready" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred II</a> (d. 1016) and King Cnut (d. 1035), with a short history of the circumstances of the gift.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The miracle stories frequently say that those who wished cures or miracles similar to those in the <em>Liber</em> would need to come to the monastery, where they could make a donation.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The historian Jennifer Paxton argues that increasing pilgrimage to the monastery was one of the main goals of the compilers of the <em>Liber</em>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Another concern of the chronicle was the acquisition of land by the abbey. The work incorporates three pre-existing inventories of the abbey's possessions, and records each gift to the abbey, giving the grantor and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and possessions of the abbey was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. The <em>Liber</em> was used by the monks to defend their claims to be the real heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of the abbey into a bishopric. The chronicle also records the division of property between the monks and the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of the monks. Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the monks and the episcopate.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The chronicle also records the conflict between the abbey and various <a href="Bishop_of_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Bishops of Lincoln</a>, which had continued until the abbey became a bishopric in 1109.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>A third theme of the work is the stress on the importance and number of distinguished burials that took place at Ely. They would have increased the desire of others to be buried there, which would have benefited the community by the donations that would have flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The <em>Liber</em> stresses the burials of <a href="Athelstan_(bishop)" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan</a>, a <a href="Bishop_of_Elmham" title="wikilink">Bishop of Elmham</a>, that of <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwine_of_Elmham" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwine</a>, another Bishop of Elmham, and <a href="Wulfstan_II" title="wikilink">Wulfstan II</a>, an <a href="Archbishop_of_York" title="wikilink">Archbishop of York</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>The <em>Liber</em> was familiar to the 13th-century chronicler <a href="Matthew_Paris" title="wikilink">Matthew Paris</a>, who used it along with the <em>Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis</em> of Ramsey Abbey in his own historical works. Another 13th-century English writer, <a href="Roger_of_Wendover" title="wikilink">Roger of Wendover</a>, was also aware of the <em>Liber</em>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Some of the information contained in the <em>Liber</em> is important to historians. It is in the <em>Liber</em> that the first statement that &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold translated the <em><a href="Benedictine_Rule" title="wikilink">Benedictine Rule</a></em> into <a href="Old_English" title="wikilink">Old English</a> is made.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The <em>Liber</em> is the longest of the local histories produced in England during the 12th century,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and it contains a description of the royal <a href="Chancery_(medieval_office)" title="wikilink">chancery</a>, which might be the earliest evidence for the existence of that office in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The <em>Liber</em> describes how King <a href="Edgar_the_Peaceful" title="wikilink">Edgar</a> (d. 975) granted the abbey the office of <a href="chancellor" class="uri" title="wikilink">chancellor</a> (head of the chancery), but the authenticity of the passage is unclear.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The existence of a formal chancery office in Anglo-Saxon England before the <a href="Norman_conquest_of_England" title="wikilink">Norman Conquest</a> is a matter of some debate amongst historians.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The historian <a href="Dorothy_Whitelock" title="wikilink">Dorothy Whitelock</a> says of the work that it is &quot;unique among post-Conquest monastic histories&quot;.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> It was written to help buttress the claims of Ely to a <a href="judicial_liberty" title="wikilink">judicial liberty</a>,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> or the exercise of all the royal rights within a <a href="Hundred_(county_subdivision)" title="wikilink">hundred</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> To do this, the <em>Liber</em> collected together earlier sources used to help the abbey evade episcopal control, prior to the abbey becoming a bishopric. These documents may have been forged or had their contents doctored to help the abbey's cause. Because of the tendentious nature of the collection, the work is used by historians with great caution.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Despite the untrustworthy nature of the <em>Liber</em> and the documents preserved therein, it remains a valuable source for the history of the time period it covers, as well as the internal history of the abbey and bishopric.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The historian Antonia Gransden characterises the <em>Liber</em> as &quot;valuable for general history&quot;, but qualifies by saying that &quot;the whole lacks unity and has errors and confusing repetitions&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="manuscripts">Manuscripts</h2>
<p>The work survives in two complete manuscripts (MS), that of <a href="Trinity_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Trinity College, Cambridge</a> MS O.2.1, usually known as the E manuscript; and one in the possession of <a href="Ely_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Ely Cathedral Chapter</a>, usually known as the F manuscript.

<p>As well as the two complete manuscripts, a number of other manuscripts contain parts of the whole work. <a href="Cotton_Library" title="wikilink">British Museum MS Cotton</a> Titus A.i, usually known as the G manuscript, has part of Book II, and dates from the late 12th or early 13th century. British Museum Cotton Domitian xv, known as the B manuscript, dates from the late 13th or early 14th century and includes some other material along with Book I and the same parts of Book II as in manuscript G. Another Cottononian manuscript, British Museum MS Cotton Vespasian A.xix, has parts of Book III, and dates to between 1257 and 1286.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> This manuscript is usually known as the A manuscript.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

A separate Book II, with parts of Book III, was then written and combined with the stand-alone Book I, into either manuscript E or an earlier version of that manuscript. Book II was then revised, combined with parts of G, Book I, and parts of E to make manuscript F.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
