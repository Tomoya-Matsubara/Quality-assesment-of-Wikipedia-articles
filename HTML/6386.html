<p>Duncan started out as a swimmer and only began playing basketball in ninth grade, after <a href="Hurricane_Hugo" title="wikilink">Hurricane Hugo</a> destroyed the only Olympic-sized pool on <a href="St._Croix,_U.S._Virgin_Islands" title="wikilink">Saint Croix</a>. He soon became a standout for <a href="St._Dunstan&#39;s_Episcopal_High_School" title="wikilink">St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School</a>, and had an illustrious college career with the <a href="Wake_Forest_University" title="wikilink">Wake Forest University</a> <a href="Wake_Forest_Demon_Deacons_men&#39;s_basketball" title="wikilink">Demon Deacons</a>, winning the <a href="Naismith_College_Player_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">Naismith College Player of the Year</a>, <a href="USBWA_College_Player_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">USBWA College Player of the Year</a> and <a href="John_Wooden_Award" title="wikilink">John Wooden</a> awards in his final year. Duncan graduated from college before entering the <a href="1997_NBA_Draft" title="wikilink">1997 NBA Draft</a> as the number one pick, and his list of accomplishments, remarkable consistency, and leadership in the Spurs' NBA title runs in <a href="1999_NBA_Finals" title="wikilink">1999</a>, <a href="2003_NBA_Finals" title="wikilink">2003</a>, <a href="2005_NBA_Finals" title="wikilink">2005</a>, and <a href="2007_NBA_Finals" title="wikilink">2007</a> have led basketball experts to consider him to be one of the greatest power forwards in NBA history.</p>
<p>Off the court, Duncan is known for his quiet and unassuming ways, as well as his active philanthropy. He holds an honors degree in psychology and created the Tim Duncan Foundation to raise general health awareness and fund education and youth sports in various parts of the United States.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<h3 id="early-life">Early life</h3>
<p>Duncan is the only son of Ione and William Duncan, a midwife and a mason respectively, joining his two older sisters Cheryl and Tricia in a middle-class family in <a href="Christiansted" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christiansted</a>, a town on <a href="St._Croix,_U.S._Virgin_Islands" title="wikilink">Saint Croix</a>, one of the main islands composing the <a href="United_States_Virgin_Islands" title="wikilink">United States Virgin Islands</a>. In school, Duncan was a bright pupil and dreamt of becoming an Olympic-level swimmer like his sister, <a href="Tricia_Duncan" title="wikilink">Tricia</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> His parents were very supportive and Duncan excelled at swimming, becoming a teenage standout in the 50, 100 and 400 meters <a href="freestyle_swimming" title="wikilink">freestyle</a> and aiming to make the <a href="1992_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1992 Olympic Games</a> as a member of the United States Team.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>When <a href="Hurricane_Hugo" title="wikilink">Hurricane Hugo</a> destroyed the island's only Olympic-sized swimming pool in 1989, forcing Duncan to swim in the ocean, he soon lost enthusiasm because of his fear of sharks.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Duncan was dealt another emotional blow when his mother was diagnosed with <a href="breast_cancer" title="wikilink">breast cancer</a> and died one day before his 14th birthday.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In her last days, she made Duncan and his sisters promise to finish college with a degree, which would later explain Duncan's reluctance to leave college early.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Duncan never swam competitively again, but was inspired by his brother-in-law to turn to basketball.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Duncan initially had difficulties adapting to the game he thought would help relieve his pain and frustration. Nancy Pomroy, the athletic director of the St. Croix Country Day School was quoted: &quot;[Duncan] was so huge. So big and tall, but he was awfully awkward at the time.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> He overcame this to become a standout for the <a href="St._Dunstan&#39;s_Episcopal_High_School" title="wikilink">St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School</a>, averaging 25 points per game as a senior. His play attracted the attention of several universities, despite having only picked up the game in ninth grade.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> <a href="Wake_Forest_University" title="wikilink">Wake Forest University</a> basketball coach <a href="Dave_Odom" title="wikilink">Dave Odom</a> in particular grew interested in Duncan after the 16-year-old allegedly played NBA star <a href="Alonzo_Mourning" title="wikilink">Alonzo Mourning</a> to a draw in a 5-on-5 pick-up game.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Odom was searching for a tall, physical player to play near the basket.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Given the weak level of basketball in the Virgin Islands, Odom was wary about Duncan at first, especially after first meeting him and thinking him to be inattentive; Duncan stared blankly at Odom for most of the conversation.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> However, after the first talk, Odom understood that this was just Duncan's way of paying attention, and discovered that he was not only athletically talented, but also a quick learner.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Eventually, despite offers by the <a href="University_of_Hartford" title="wikilink">University of Hartford</a>, the <a href="University_of_Delaware" title="wikilink">University of Delaware</a> and <a href="Providence_College" title="wikilink">Providence College</a>, Duncan joined Odom's Wake Forest Demon Deacons.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="wake-forest-university">Wake Forest University</h3>

<p>The Wake Forest Demon Deacons had previously reached the <a href="NCAA_Men&#39;s_Division_I_Basketball_Championship" title="wikilink">Sweet 16</a>, but lost main scorer <a href="Rodney_Rogers" title="wikilink">Rodney Rogers</a>, who had entered the <a href="1993_NBA_Draft" title="wikilink">1993 NBA Draft</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Duncan struggled with early transition problems and was even held scoreless in his first college game, but as the year progressed, he and teammate <a href="Randolph_Childress" title="wikilink">Randolph Childress</a> led the Deacons to a 20&lt;U+2013&gt;11 win&lt;U+2013&gt;loss record.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Duncan's style of play was simple but effective, combining an array of <a href="Basketball_court#Low_post_area" title="wikilink">low-post</a> moves, mid-range <a href="Basketball_moves#Bank_shot" title="wikilink">bank shots</a> and tough defense. He was chosen to represent the U.S. in the 1994 <a href="Goodwill_Games" title="wikilink">Goodwill Games</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Meanwhile, Duncan worked towards a degree in psychology and also took classes in anthropology and Chinese literature.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Despite focusing heavily on basketball, Wake Forest psychology department chairperson Deborah Best was quoted: &quot;Tim [...] was one of my more intellectual students. [...] Other than his height, I couldn't tell him from any other student at Wake Forest.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Duncan also established his reputation as a stoic player, to the extent that opposing fans taunted him as &quot;<a href="Mr._Spock" title="wikilink">Mr. Spock</a>&quot;, the prototypical logical, detached character from <em><a href="Star_Trek" title="wikilink">Star Trek</a></em>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In the <a href="1994_in_basketball" title="wikilink">1994&lt;U+2013&gt;95 NCAA season</a>, the sophomore was soon called one of the most eligible NBA prospects, along with his peers <a href="Joe_Smith_(basketball)" title="wikilink">Joe Smith</a>, <a href="Rasheed_Wallace" title="wikilink">Rasheed Wallace</a> and <a href="Jerry_Stackhouse" title="wikilink">Jerry Stackhouse</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> <a href="Los_Angeles_Lakers" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Lakers</a> general manager <a href="Jerry_West" title="wikilink">Jerry West</a> suggested that Duncan might become the top pick in the <a href="1995_NBA_Draft" title="wikilink">1995 NBA Draft</a> if he went early, but Duncan assured everyone he had no intention of <a href="professional_sports" title="wikilink">going pro</a> until he graduated, even though the NBA was planning to add a rookie <a href="salary_cap" title="wikilink">salary cap</a> in 1996. He was giving up a lot of money, but was determined to stay in school.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In that season, he led the Demon Deacons into the <a href="Atlantic_Coast_Conference" title="wikilink">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> (ACC) championship game against a Rasheed Wallace-led <a href="North_Carolina_Tar_Heels" title="wikilink">North Carolina Tar Heels</a>. During that game, Duncan neutralized the threat of Wallace, while Childress sealed the win with a <a href="Jump_shot_(basketball)" title="wikilink">jump shot</a> with four seconds left in <a href="overtime_(sports)" title="wikilink">overtime</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In the <a href="National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association" title="wikilink">NCAA</a> Tournament, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16, and playing against <a href="Oklahoma_State" title="wikilink">Oklahoma State</a>, Duncan scored 12 points to go with 22 rebounds and eight blocks, outplaying <a href="Bryant_Reeves" title="wikilink">Bryant Reeves</a>, but his team lost 71&lt;U+2013&gt;66. Still, Duncan ended the year averaging 16.8 <a href="point_(basketball)" title="wikilink">points</a> and 12.5 <a href="rebound_(basketball)" title="wikilink">rebounds</a> per game, was named Defensive Player of the Year and became the third-best <a href="block_(basketball)" title="wikilink">shot-blocker</a> in NCAA history with 3.98 blocks per game.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He was also voted All-ACC First Team, a feat he would repeat in each of his two remaining years at Wake Forest.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>In the following <a href="1995_in_basketball" title="wikilink">1995&lt;U+2013&gt;96 NCAA season</a>, Wake Forest had to deal with the loss of Childress, who entered the NBA. This provided an opportunity for Duncan to show his leadership qualities, and his inexperienced team lost only four games in the entire ACC season.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The Demon Deacons won the ACC Finals again, but in the Sweet 16, Duncan came down with flu, and his team missed the <a href="Final_Four" title="wikilink">Final Four</a> by one win. He completed another remarkable season with averages of 19.1 points and 12.3 rebounds per game, and was again voted Defensive and ACC Player of the Year.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> At the season's end the Wake Forest star was rumored to enter the NBA Draft early, but in the end, he stayed in college.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>In the <a href="1996_in_basketball" title="wikilink">1996&lt;U+2013&gt;97 NCAA season</a>, Duncan was helped by the addition of future NBA player <a href="Loren_Woods" title="wikilink">Loren Woods</a>, a 7'1&quot; player who eased the pressure on Duncan close to the basket. The Demon Deacons won their first 13 games, but then got into a slump and failed to win a third ACC title.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The NCAA campaign was just as frustrating, as <a href="Stanford_University" title="wikilink">Stanford University</a> led by future NBA <a href="point_guard" title="wikilink">point guard</a> <a href="Brevin_Knight" title="wikilink">Brevin Knight</a> eliminated Duncan's team with a 72&lt;U+2013&gt;66 win. Duncan finished with an individually impressive season though, averaging 20.8 points, 14.7 rebounds and 3.2 <a href="assist_(basketball)" title="wikilink">assists</a> per game while shooting .606 from the <a href="field_goal_percentage" title="wikilink">field</a> and winning the Defensive Player of the Year for an unprecedented third straight season. He earned first-team <a href="All-America" class="uri" title="wikilink">All-America</a> honors for the second time, and was a unanimous pick for both <a href="USBWA_College_Player_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">USWBA</a> and <a href="Naismith_College_Player_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">Naismith College Player of the Year</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Duncan led the 1996&lt;U+2013&gt;97 NCAA Division I in rebounding, was 10th in blocked shots (3.3 bpg) and 28th in scoring (20.8 ppg).<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> He was voted ACC Player of the Year again and won the 1997 <a href="John_Wooden_Award" title="wikilink">John Wooden Award</a> as the NCAA's best overall male player based on the votes of sportscasters and newswriters.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>In contrast to contemporary <a href="prep-to-pro" class="uri" title="wikilink">prep-to-pro</a> players like <a href="Kevin_Garnett" title="wikilink">Kevin Garnett</a>, <a href="Jermaine_O&#39;Neal" title="wikilink">Jermaine O'Neal</a>, <a href="Tracy_McGrady" title="wikilink">Tracy McGrady</a> or <a href="Kobe_Bryant" title="wikilink">Kobe Bryant</a>, Duncan stayed at college for a full four years. During that period, he was a two-time ACC Player of the Year, and an unprecedented three-time <a href="NABC_Defensive_Player_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">NABC Defensive Player of the Year</a>. The center also made the All-ACC Tournament between 1995 and 1997, the All-ACC First Team between 1995 and 1997, and was named <a href="Most_Valuable_Player" title="wikilink">Most Valuable Player</a> of the 1996 ACC Tournament. Further, 1996 was the year where he led the conference in scoring, rebounding, field goal percentage and blocked shots, becoming the first player in conference history to lead all four of those categories.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Overall, Duncan led his team to a 97&lt;U+2013&gt;31 win&lt;U+2013&gt;loss record and finished his college career as the second-leading shot blocker in NCAA history, and remains one of only ten players with more than 2,000 career points and 1,500 career rebounds. He was also the first player in NCAA history to reach 1,500 points, 1,000 rebounds, 400 blocked shots and 200 assists. He left college as the all-time leading shot-blocker in ACC history with 481 blocks&lt;U+2014&gt;second in NCAA annals behind <a href="Colgate_University" title="wikilink">Colgate's</a> <a href="Adonal_Foyle" title="wikilink">Adonal Foyle</a> and third on the ACC career rebounding list with 1,570 rebounds.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> With his college degree in his hands, Duncan finally made himself eligible for the <a href="1997_NBA_Draft" title="wikilink">1997 NBA Draft</a>.</p>

With an experienced <a href="center_(basketball)" title="wikilink">center</a> in Robinson and the number one pick in Duncan, the Spurs featured one of the best <a href="frontcourt" title="wikilink">frontcourts</a> in the league.

<p>Duncan cites his late mother Ione as his main inspiration. Among other things, she taught him and his sisters the nursery rhyme &quot;Good, Better, Best. Never let it rest / Until your Good is Better, and your Better is your Best&quot;, which he adopted as his personal motto.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> On and off the court, he believes that the three most important values are dedication, teamwork and camaraderie.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> The Spurs captain has also stated that he chose #21 for his jersey because that was his brother-in-law's college number, since he was Duncan's main basketball inspiration, and cites Hall-of-Fame <a href="Los_Angeles_Lakers" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Lakers</a> point guard <a href="Magic_Johnson" title="wikilink">Magic Johnson</a> as his childhood idol.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a></p>
