<p><a href="image:Ziziphus_mistol_griseb1.jpg" title="wikilink">200px|right|thumb</a> <strong><em>Ziziphus mistol</em></strong> Griceb or <strong>mistol</strong>, is a spiniferous tree of the family <a href="Rhamnaceae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rhamnaceae</a>, that belongs to genus <a href="Ziziphus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ziziphus</a>, natural (and very abundant) of certain areas of <a href="Gran_Chaco" title="wikilink">Gran Chaco</a>. The word &quot;mistol&quot; derives from colonial era spanish, from the word &quot;mixture&quot; (mezcla) since it was believed that mistol was a hybrid between species of genus <a href="Schinopsis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Schinopsis</a> because of the likely color of its wood to spaniard colonists perception.</p>
<h2 id="morphology">Morphology</h2>
<p>The <em>mistol</em> varies greatly in height, it may reach 10 to 15 meters though most individuals have no more than 4 to 9 meters high. Trunk diameter is also variable, it ranges 20 to 60 centimeters. The branches are pubescent, abundant, with spines near the leaves, and arranged in zig-zag. Its foliage is <a href="semi-deciduous" class="uri" title="wikilink">semi-deciduous</a>. Mistol leaves are oval shaped, alternate, entire, with three prominent basal veins, 2-7 cm long and slighty petiolated. It flowers late in spring, from october to december and fructifies from november to march. The fruit is an edible drupe, redish-hazel coloured, roughly spherical, 1-5 cm long, sweet and sugary, with a distinct bitterness when ripe.</p>
<p>Mistol wood is quite tough, heavy and enduring (hence its early confussion with that of Schinopsis genus). It is often used in hand held tools, carriage wheels and less frequently to produce slow burning coal.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Known for centuries before Spanish colonization of Gran Chaco, the mistol was a regular (or even key) dietary item for several amerindian local tribes (<a href="Comeching&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" title="wikilink">comechingons</a>, <a href="Diaguita" title="wikilink">diaguitas</a>, <a href="Quilmes_(tribe)" title="wikilink">quilmes</a>, etc.). It can be eaten natural when ripe or processed. A known preparation with mistol fruit is <a href="arrope" class="uri" title="wikilink">arrope</a>, an overcooked result of its juice, pulp and cane sugar. Mistol coffee is available in <a href="South_America" title="wikilink">south american</a> diet shops, it's becoming slowly popular due to the fact that it contains almost no <a href="caffeine" class="uri" title="wikilink">caffeine</a> or other xanthine alkaloids.</p>
