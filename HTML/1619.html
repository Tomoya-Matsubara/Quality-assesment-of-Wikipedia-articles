<p><strong>Terrance Stanley &quot;Terry&quot; Fox</strong>,  (July 28, 1958 &lt;U+2013&gt; June 28, 1981) was a Canadian <a href="Humanitarianism" title="wikilink">humanitarian</a>, <a href="sportsperson" title="wikilink">athlete</a>, and <a href="cancer_research" title="wikilink">cancer research</a> activist. He was a distance runner and <a href="basketball" class="uri" title="wikilink">basketball</a> player for his <a href="Port_Coquitlam" title="wikilink">Port Coquitlam</a>, <a href="British_Columbia" title="wikilink">British Columbia</a> high school and <a href="Simon_Fraser_University" title="wikilink">Simon Fraser University</a>. His right leg was amputated in 1977 after he was diagnosed with <a href="osteosarcoma" class="uri" title="wikilink">osteosarcoma</a>, though he continued to run using an artificial leg. He also played <a href="wheelchair_basketball" title="wikilink">wheelchair basketball</a> in Vancouver after losing his leg, winning three national championships.</p>
<p>In 1980, he attempted to run across Canada in the Marathon of Hope to raise cancer awareness. Fox hoped to raise one dollar for each of Canada's 24 million people. His effort began with little fanfare as he left <a href="St_John&#39;s,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="wikilink">St. John's</a>, <a href="Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="wikilink">Newfoundland</a> in April and ran the equivalent of a full marathon every day. Fox had become a national star by the time he reached <a href="Ontario" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ontario</a>; he made numerous appearances with the public, businessmen and politicians in his efforts to raise money for research. He was forced to end his run outside of <a href="Thunder_Bay" title="wikilink">Thunder Bay</a> after 143 days and 5,300 kilometres when his cancer spread to his lungs. His hopes of overcoming the disease and completing his marathon ended when he died nine months later.</p>
<p>Fox was the youngest person ever named a <a href="Order_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Companion of the Order of Canada</a>, the nation's highest civilian award. He won the 1980 <a href="Lou_Marsh_Award" title="wikilink">Lou Marsh Award</a> as the nation's top sportsman and was named Canada's <a href="Canadian_Newsmaker_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">Newsmaker of the Year</a> in both 1980 and 1981. Today, millions of people in over 60 countries participate in the annual <a href="Terry_Fox_Run" title="wikilink">Terry Fox Run</a>, first held in 1981 and now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research; over <a href="Canadian_Dollar" title="wikilink">C$</a>500 million has been raised in his name. Considered a national hero, many buildings, roads and parks have been named in Fox's honour across the country.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-and-cancer">Early life and cancer</h2>
<p>Fox was born July 28, 1958 in <a href="Winnipeg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Winnipeg</a>, <a href="Manitoba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manitoba</a> to Rolly and Betty Fox. Rolly was a switchman for the <a href="Canadian_National_Railway" title="wikilink">Canadian National Railway</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Terry had an elder brother, Fred, a younger brother, Darrel and younger sister, Judith.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> His family moved to <a href="Surrey,_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">Surrey</a>, <a href="British_Columbia" title="wikilink">British Columbia</a> in 1966 then settled in <a href="Port_Coquitlam,_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">Port Coquitlam</a> in 1968.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> His parents were dedicated to their family, and his mother was especially protective of her children; it was through her that Fox developed his stubborn dedication to what ever task he committed to do.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> His father recalled that he was extremely competitive, noting that Terry hated to lose so much that he would continue at any activity until he succeeded.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>He was an enthusiastic athlete, playing <a href="soccer" class="uri" title="wikilink">soccer</a>, <a href="Rugby_football" title="wikilink">rugby</a> and <a href="baseball" class="uri" title="wikilink">baseball</a> as a child.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> His passion was for <a href="basketball" class="uri" title="wikilink">basketball</a> and though he stood only five feet tall and was a poor player at the time, he sought to make his school team in grade eight. His physical education teacher and basketball coach at Mary Hill Junior High School suggested that he consider cross-country running instead. Fox had no desire for the sport, but took it up because he respected and wanted to please his coach.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> He was determined to continue playing basketball however, even if he was the last player on the team. Fox played only one minute in his grade eight season, but dedicated his summers to improving his play. He became a regular player in grade nine, and earned a starting position in grade ten.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In grade 12, he co-won his high school's athlete of the year award with his best friend Doug Alward.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Initially unsure if he wanted to go to university, Fox's mother convinced him to enroll at <a href="Simon_Fraser_University" title="wikilink">Simon Fraser University</a>, and expressing a desire to become a physical education teacher, he studied <a href="kinesiology" class="uri" title="wikilink">kinesiology</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> He tried out for the junior varsity basketball team, earning a spot ahead of more talented players due to his determination.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>On November 12, 1976, as Fox was driving home to Port Coquitlam, he became distracted by nearby bridge construction, and crashed into the back of a pickup truck. While his car was left undrivable, Fox emerged with only a sore right knee. He again felt pain in December but chose to ignore it until the completion of his basketball season.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> By March 1977, the pain had intensified and he finally went to hospital where he was diagnosed with <a href="osteosarcoma" class="uri" title="wikilink">osteosarcoma</a>, a form of cancer that often starts near the knees.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Fox believed his car accident weakened his knee and left it vulnerable to the disease though his doctors argued there was no connection.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He was told that his leg had to be amputated and he would require <a href="chemotherapy" class="uri" title="wikilink">chemotherapy</a> treatments, but that recent medical advances meant he had a 50 percent chance of survival. It would have been just 15 percent two years before. The statement enforced a belief in Fox on the value of cancer research.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>With the help of an artificial leg, Fox was walking three weeks after his amputation.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> He then progressed to playing golf with his father.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Doctors were impressed with Fox's positive outlook, stating it contributed to his rapid recovery.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> He endured sixteen months of chemotherapy and found the time he spent in the British Columbia Cancer Control Agency facility difficult as he watched fellow cancer patients suffer and die from the disease.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Fox ended his treatment with a new purpose. He felt that he owed his survival to medical advances and wished to live his life in a way that would help others find courage.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Rick_Hansen" title="wikilink">Rick Hansen</a>, working with the Canadian Wheelchair Sports Association, invited Fox to try out for his <a href="wheelchair_basketball" title="wikilink">wheelchair basketball</a> team in the summer of 1977.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Although he was undergoing chemotherapy treatments at the time, Fox's energy impressed Hansen.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Less than two months after learning how to play the sport from a wheelchair, Fox played for the national championship in Edmonton.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He won three national championships with the team,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and was named an all-star by the North American Wheelchair Basketball Association.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

A caption on the pedestal reads &quot;somewhere the hurting must stop... Terry Fox 1958&lt;U+2013&gt;1981&quot;" /> The night before his surgery, Fox was given an article about <a href="Dick_Traum" title="wikilink">Dick Traum</a>, the first amputee to complete the <a href="New_York_Marathon" title="wikilink">New York Marathon</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The article inspired him; he embarked on a 14-month training program, telling his family he planned to compete in a marathon himself.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In private, he devised a greater plan. His experiences in hospital upset Fox, who became angry at how little money was dedicated to cancer research in Canada. He intended to run the length of Canada in the hopes of increasing cancer awareness, a plan he had initially only told Alward about.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Fox ran with an unusual gait, as he was required to hop-step on his good leg due to the extra time the springs in his artificial leg required to re-set after each step.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> He found the training painful. The additional pressure he had to place on both his good leg and his stump led to bone bruises, blisters and intense pain. He found that after about 20 minutes of each run he crossed a pain threshold and the run became easier.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>In August 1979, Fox competed in a marathon in <a href="Prince_George,_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">Prince George, British Columbia</a> where he finished in last place, ten minutes behind the nearest competitor. His effort was met with tears and applause from the other participants.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Following the marathon, he revealed his plan to his family.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> He initially hoped to raise $1 million,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> but later sought to raise $1 for each of Canada's 24 million people.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="canadian-cancer-society-letter">Canadian Cancer Society letter</h3>
<p>Fox began by sending a letter to the <a href="Canadian_Cancer_Society" title="wikilink">Canadian Cancer Society</a> on October 15, 1979. He announced his goal and appealed for funding. Fox wrote: </p>
<p>He composed a second letter to various corporations seeking donations for &quot;gas, a vehicle, running shoes, and money respectively.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Fox also sent other letters asking for grants to buy a running leg. He observed here that while he was grateful to be alive following his cancer treatment, &quot;I remember promising myself that, should I live, I would rise up to meet this new challenge [of fundraising for cancer research] face to face and prove myself worthy of life, something too many people take for granted.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The <a href="Ford_Motor_Company" title="wikilink">Ford Motor Company</a> donated a camper van,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> while <a href="Imperial_Oil" title="wikilink">Imperial Oil</a> donated fuel and <a href="Adidas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adidas</a> gave him his running shoes.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Fox turned away every company that requested he endorse their products and refused any donation that carried conditions; he insisted that nobody was to profit from his run.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Although skeptical of his dedication, the Cancer Society agreed to support Fox once he had gained the support of sponsors but requested he get a medical certificate from a heart specialist that stated he was fit to attempt the run. He was diagnosed with <a href="Left_ventricular_hypertrophy" title="wikilink">Left ventricular hypertrophy</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;an enlarged heart&lt;U+2014&gt;a condition commonly associated with athletes. Doctors warned Fox of potential risks he faced as a result though they did not consider his condition a significant concern. They agreed to endorse Fox's run on the promise that he would stop immediately if he began to experience any heart problems.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="trek-across-canada">Trek across Canada</h3>
<p>The Marathon began on April 12, 1980. Fox dipped his right leg in the Atlantic Ocean near <a href="St_John&#39;s,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="wikilink">St. John's</a>, <a href="Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="wikilink">Newfoundland</a>, and filled two large bottles with ocean water. He intended to keep one as a souvenir and pour the other one into the Pacific Ocean upon completing his journey at <a href="Victoria,_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">Victoria, British Columbia</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> He was supported on his run by Alward, who drove the van and cooked meals, and by his brother Darryl.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>Fox was met with gale force winds, heavy rain and a snowstorm in the first days of his run.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> He was initially disappointed with the reception he received, but was heartened upon arriving in <a href="Channel-Port_aux_Basques,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="wikilink">Port aux Basques, Newfoundland</a> where the town's 10,000 residents presented him with a donation of over $10,000.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> He left the <a href="Maritimes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maritimes</a> on June 10 and faced new challenges entering <a href="Quebec" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quebec</a> due to his group's inability to speak French.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> He was left weary by drivers who continually forced him off the road.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Fox arrived in Montreal on June 22, one-third of the way through his 8,000km journey, having collected over $200,000 in donations.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> He spent additional time in Montreal after the Canadian Cancer Society asked him to delay his schedule so as to arrive in Ottawa for <a href="Canada_Day" title="wikilink">Canada Day</a>, a plan Fox agreed to only after being convinced it would aid fundraising efforts.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>Fox crossed into Ontario at the town of <a href="Hawkesbury,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Hawkesbury</a> on the last Saturday in June. He was met by a brass band and thousands of residents who lined the streets to cheer him on while the <a href="Ontario_Provincial_Police" title="wikilink">Ontario Provincial Police</a> gave him an escort throughout the province.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Despite the sweltering heat of summer, he continued to run 26 miles per day.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Upon arriving in <a href="Ottawa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ottawa</a>, Fox met <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Pierre_Trudeau" title="wikilink">Pierre Trudeau</a> and <a href="Governor_General_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Governor General</a> <a href="Edward_Schreyer" title="wikilink">Ed Schreyer</a> and was the guest of honour at numerous sporting events in the city.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> He performed a ceremonial kickoff in front of 16,000 fans who gave him a standing ovation at a <a href="Canadian_Football_League" title="wikilink">Canadian Football League</a> game. His journal reflected his growing excitement at the reception he had received as he began to understand how deeply moved Canadians were by his efforts.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>A crowd of 10,000 people met Fox in <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a> where he was heralded in <a href="Nathan_Phillips_Square" title="wikilink">Nathan Phillips Square</a>. As he ran to the square, he was met on the road by many people who joined him in running, including <a href="National_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">National Hockey League</a> star <a href="Darryl_Sittler" title="wikilink">Darryl Sittler</a> who presented Fox with his 1980 All-Star Game jersey. The Cancer Society estimated it collected $100,000 in donations that day alone.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> As he continued through southern Ontario, he was met by <a href="Hockey_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Hockey Hall of Famer</a> <a href="Bobby_Orr" title="wikilink">Bobby Orr</a> who presented him with a cheque for $25,000. Fox considered meeting Orr the highlight of his journey.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>As his fame grew, the Cancer Society scheduled him to attend an increasing number of functions and give more speeches.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Fox attempted to accommodate any request that he believed would raise money, no matter how far out of his way it took him.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> He bristled, however, at what he felt were media intrusions in his personal life&lt;U+2014&gt;The <em><a href="Toronto_Star" title="wikilink">Toronto Star</a></em> reported at one point that he had gone on a date.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> He was left unsure of who he could trust in the media after negative articles began to emerge, including one by the <em><a href="Globe_and_Mail" title="wikilink">Globe and Mail</a></em> that characterized him as a &quot;tyrannical brother&quot; who verbally abused Darryl and claimed he was running because he held a grudge against a doctor who misdiagnosed his condition, claims he referred to as &quot;trash&quot;.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>The physical demands of running a marathon every day took its toll on Fox's body. Other than at the request of the Cancer Society while in Montreal, he refused to take a day off, even on his 22nd birthday.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> He frequently suffered shin splints and an inflamed knee. He developed cysts on his stump and suffered dizzy spells.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Fox rejected calls for him to seek regular medical checkups,<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> and dismissed suggestions he was risking his future health.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> At one point he suffered a soreness in his ankle that would not go away. Although he feared he had suffered a stress fracture, he ran for three more days before seeking medical attention, and was relieved to learn he only suffered from <a href="tendinitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tendinitis</a> and that it could be treated with painkillers.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>In spite of his immense recuperative ability,<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Fox found that by late August he felt exhausted before he began his day's run.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> On September 1, outside of <a href="Thunder_Bay" title="wikilink">Thunder Bay</a>, he was forced to stop briefly after suffering an intense coughing fit and experiencing pains in his chest. Unsure of what else to do, he resumed running as the crowds along the highway shouted out their encouragement.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> A few miles later, experiencing a shortness of breath and still suffering the pain in his chest, he asked Alward to drive him to the hospital. He feared immediately that he had run his last mile.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The next day he held a tearful press conference announcing that his cancer had returned and spread to his lungs. As a result, he was forced to end his run after 143 days and 5,300 kilometres.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> While others offered to complete the run for him, Fox refused, stating that he wanted to complete his marathon himself.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
