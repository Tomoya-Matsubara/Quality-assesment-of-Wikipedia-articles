Its construction is attributed to the pagan Saxons, probably in the late sixth century.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It runs at least from <a href="Maes_Knoll" title="wikilink">Maes Knoll</a> in historic <a href="Somerset" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somerset</a>, a <a href="hillfort" class="uri" title="wikilink">hillfort</a> at the east end of <a href="Dundry_Hill" title="wikilink">Dundry Hill</a> south of <a href="Bristol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bristol</a>, to the <a href="Savernake_Forest" title="wikilink">Savernake Forest</a> near <a href="Marlborough,_Wiltshire" title="wikilink">Marlborough, Wiltshire</a>. There is also some evidence in charters that it extended west from Maes Knoll to the coast of the <a href="Severn_Estuary" title="wikilink">Severn Estuary</a> but this is uncertain.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It may possibly define a <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Roman</a> boundary.</p>
<h2 id="usage-and-dating">Usage and dating</h2>
<p>Wansdyke consists of two sections of 14 and 19 kilometres (9 and 12 mi) long with some gaps in between. East Wansdyke is an impressive linear earthwork, consisting of a ditch and bank running approximately east-west, between Savernake Forest and Morgan's Hill. West Wansdyke is also a linear earthwork, running from Bath to Maes Knoll south of Bristol, but less impressive than its eastern counterpart. The middle section, 22 kilometres (14 mi) long, is sometimes referred to as 'Mid Wansdyke', but is formed by the remains of the London to Bath Roman road. It used to be thought that these sections were all part of one continuous undertaking, especially during the Middle Ages when the pagan name <em>Wansdyke</em> was applied to all three parts. However, it is not now considered certain that this is so.</p>
<h2 id="east-wansdyke">East Wansdyke</h2>
<p>East Wansdyke in <a href="Wiltshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wiltshire</a>, on the south of the <a href="Marlborough_Downs" title="wikilink">Marlborough Downs</a>, has been less disturbed by later agriculture and building and remains more clearly traceable on the ground than the western part. Here the bank is up to  high with a ditch up to  deep. Wansdyke's origins are unclear, but archaeological data shows that the eastern part was probably built during the 5th or 6th century. That is after the withdrawal of the <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Romans</a> and before the takeover by <a href="Anglo-Saxons" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxons</a>. The ditch is on the north side, so presumably it was used by the <a href="Britons_(historical)" title="wikilink">British</a> as a defence against <a href="Wessex" title="wikilink">West Saxons</a> encroaching from the upper <a href="Thames_valley" title="wikilink">Thames valley</a> westward into what is now the <a href="West_Country" title="wikilink">West Country</a>.</p>
<p>Lieut.-General <a href="Augustus_Pitt_Rivers" title="wikilink">Augusturs Pitt-Rivers</a> carried out excavations at the Wansdyke in Wiltshire in the late 19th century, considering it the remains of a great war in which the southwest was being defended.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Its relationship to the expansion of the West Saxons was considered in 1964 by J.N.L. Myres, who maintained to the end a minority opinion that Wansdyke was constructed by <a href="Sub-Roman_Britain" title="wikilink">some sub-Roman authority</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="west-wansdyke">West Wansdyke</h2>
<p>Although the antiquarians like John Collinson <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> considered West Wansdyke to stretch from south east of Bath to the west of Maes Knoll,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> a review in 1960 considered that there was no evidence of its existence to the west of Maes Knoll <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Keith Gardner refuted this with newly discovered documentary evidence.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In 2007 a series of sections were dug across the earthwork which showed that it had existed where there are no longer visible surface remains.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> It was shown that the earthwork had a consistent design, with stone or timber revetment. There was little dating evidence but it was consistent with either a late Roman or post-Roman date. A paper in &quot;The Last of the Britons&quot; conference in 2007 suggests that the West Wansdyke continues from Maes Knoll to the hill forts above the Avon Gorge and controls the crossings of the river at Saltford and Bristol as well as at Bath <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>As there is little <a href="archaeological" class="uri" title="wikilink">archaeological</a> evidence to date the western Wansdyke, it may have marked a division between <a href="Britons_(historic)" title="wikilink">British</a> <a href="Celts" title="wikilink">Celtic</a> kingdoms or have been a boundary with the Saxons. The evidence for its western extension is earthworks along the north side of <a href="Dundry_Hill" title="wikilink">Dundry Hill</a>, its mention in a charter and a road name.</p>
<p>The area of the western Wansdyke became the border between the <a href="Romano-British" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romano-British</a> Celts and the <a href="Anglo-Saxons" title="wikilink">West Saxons</a> following the <a href="Battle_of_Deorham" title="wikilink">Battle of Deorham</a> in 577 <a href="Anno_Domini" title="wikilink">AD</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> According to the <a href="Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>, the 'Saxon' <a href="Cenwalh_of_Wessex" title="wikilink">Cenwalh</a> achieved a breakthrough against the <a href="Brython" title="wikilink">British</a> Celtic tribes, with victories at <a href="Bradford-on-Avon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bradford-on-Avon</a> (in the <em>Avon Gap</em> in the Wansdyke) in 652 AD,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and further south at the <a href="Battle_of_Peonnum" title="wikilink">Battle of Peonnum</a> (at <a href="Penselwood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Penselwood</a>) in 658 AD,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> followed by an advance west through the <a href="Polden_Hills" title="wikilink">Polden Hills</a> to the <a href="River_Parrett" title="wikilink">River Parrett</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> It is however significant to note that the names of the early Wessex kings appear to have a <a href="British_language" title="wikilink">Brythonic</a> (British) rather than <a href="Germanic_languages" title="wikilink">Germanic</a> (Saxon) etymology.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="nomenclature">Nomenclature</h2>
<p>When the Saxons came upon the dyke, they named it after their god <a href="Woden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Woden</a>, hence it became 'Woden's Dyke' and, eventually, Wansdyke. Its name occurs in charters of the 9th and 10th century AD. It may be compared to both <a href="Offa&#39;s_Dyke" title="wikilink">Offa's Dyke</a> (later, and forming a <a href="Mercian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mercian</a> border with Wales) and <a href="Hadrian&#39;s_Wall" title="wikilink">Hadrian's Wall</a> (earlier and forming a border with Scotland) as one of the largest defensive earthworks in the United Kingdom. <a href="Nennius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nennius</a>, an 8th century <a href="Welsh_people" title="wikilink">Welsh</a> <a href="monk" class="uri" title="wikilink">monk</a> who had access to older <a href="chronicle" title="wikilink">chronicles</a> since lost, describes these defences and their purpose, and links them to the <a href="Arthurian_legend" title="wikilink">legends</a> of <a href="King_Arthur" title="wikilink">King Arthur</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="modern-use-of-name">Modern use of name</h2>
<p>The Western Wansdyke gave its name to the former <a href="Wansdyke_(district)" title="wikilink">Wansdyke district</a> of the county of <a href="Avon_(county)" title="wikilink">Avon</a>, and also to the <a href="Wansdyke_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Wansdyke constituency</a>.
