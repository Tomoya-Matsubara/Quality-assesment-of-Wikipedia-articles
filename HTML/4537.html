<h2 id="history-of-the-bau00f1os">History of the &quot;Ba&lt;U+00F1&gt;os&quot;</h2>
<p>The <a href="Taino" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taino</a>'s who inhabited Puerto Rico before the arrival of <a href="Christopher_Columbus" title="wikilink">Christopher Columbus</a> and the <a href="Spanish_people" title="wikilink">Spanish</a> <a href="conquistador" title="wikilink">conquistadors</a> were the first people to discover the hot spring waters of Coamo. During the mid-16th century the word spread among the Spanish settlers of the healing powers of the spring waters and as a consequence, many of the settlers began to make the regular journeys from San Juan to the mountainous region to enjoy what they believed were the benefits of said waters.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1847, Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt;s G. Luhring built the first structures in &quot;Los Ba&lt;U+00F1&gt;os&quot;. He built a guest house (hostel) made of wood in front of the baths to house the frequent visitors. He later had the main guest house built of stone and wood. Luhring had barriers placed around the baths which provided the visitors with privacy while bathing. Luhring lacked the necessary capital to continue operations and sold his interest in the same to a native Coame&lt;U+00F1&gt;o, Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Usera who in 1857 built an elegant hotel out of brick, rubble masonry and wood which lasted well into the late 20th century.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>When the United States invaded Puerto Rico as a result of the <a href="Spanish-American_War" title="wikilink">Spanish-American War</a>, the town of Coamo was involved in what is known as the <a href="Puerto_Rican_Campaign#Battle_of_Coamo" title="wikilink">Battle of Coamo</a>. 248 Spanish and Puerto Rican troops under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Rafael Martinez-Illesas held the Ba&lt;U+00F1&gt;os de Coamo. General <a href="James_H._Wilson" title="wikilink">James H. Wilson</a> ordered the 3rd and 4th Regular Pennsylvania Artillery to provide artillery support for the frontal assault on the Ba&lt;U+00F1&gt;os, while Troop C covered the right side against flanking. The troops under Lt. Col. Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;nez had already traveled eastward towards the town of <a href="Aibonito" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aibonito</a> and only a handful of soldiers remained behind to delay the American advance. Troop C galloped at top speed north from the Ba&lt;U+00F1&gt;os de Coamo, after finding the resort abandoned by the Spanish. The damages caused by the artillery bombardment during the war are still visible today.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1879, <a href="Braulio_Due&lt;U+00F1&gt;o_Colon" title="wikilink">Braulio Due&lt;U+00F1&gt;o Colon</a>, a Puerto Rican musician and composer, composed the music for the <a href="Zarzuela" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zarzuela</a> ( a Spanish lyric-dramatic genre that alternates between spoken and sung scenes, the latter incorporating operatic and popular song, as well as dance) &quot;Los Ba&lt;U+00F1&gt;os de Coamo&quot; which was originally written by Genaro de Arazamendi.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1970 the <a href="Government_of_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Government of Puerto Rico</a> established &quot;El Programa de Paradores de Puerto Rico&quot; (The Parador Program of Puerto Rico) under the jurisdiction of &quot;La Compa&lt;U+00F1&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt;a de Turismo de Puerto Rico&quot; (The Puerto Rico Turism Company). The Ba&lt;U+00F1&gt;os de Coamo were included in the program and modern structures were built. What remains of the original hotel which Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Usera built in 1857 is the restaurant and some walls which add to the historic ambiance of the modern Parador.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The Parador at the hot springs, is called &quot;El Parador Ba&lt;U+00F1&gt;os de Coamo&quot;. The Parador, unlike a hotel, is small and cozy and has a swimming pool which has an access area to the hot springs. There is a pool which is supplied with the hot srping water with underground piping. There are multiple levels of baths, The top level is the hottest, this spills into a larger bath below which is cooler and then finally into a large pool which is coolest, but still warm. The pools are drained regularly for sanitation and cleaning.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
