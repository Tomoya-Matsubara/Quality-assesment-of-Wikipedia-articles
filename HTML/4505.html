<p>The <strong>Rio Grande Valley Giants</strong> was a <a href="minor_league_baseball" title="wikilink">minor league baseball</a> franchise in the Double-A <a href="Texas_League" title="wikilink">Texas League</a> located in <a href="Harlingen,_Texas" title="wikilink">Harlingen, Texas</a>, USA, from the beginning of the <a href="1960_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1960</a> season through June 10, 1961. As its nickname implies, the team was affiliated with the <a href="San_Francisco_Giants" title="wikilink">San Francisco Giants</a>.</p>
<p>The Texas League underwent a massive face lift in the late 1950s after three of its top franchises &lt;U+2014&gt; <a href="Dallas_Rangers" title="wikilink">Dallas</a>, <a href="Fort_Worth_Cats" title="wikilink">Fort Worth</a> and <a href="Houston_Buffaloes" title="wikilink">Houston</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; moved up to the Triple-A <a href="American_Association_(20th_century)" title="wikilink">American Association</a> for the <a href="1959_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1959</a> season.</p>
<p>The <a href="Corpus_Christi_Giants" title="wikilink">Corpus Christi Giants</a>, which joined the TL in <a href="1958_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1958</a>, finished last in attendance (61,500) in 1959, and transferred to Harlingen over the winter. Harlingen had been represented in numerous lower-level minor leagues, most recently the <a href="Big_State_League_(1947-1957)" title="wikilink">Big State League</a> (1954-55).</p>
<p>In 1960, the Rio Grande Valley club won the regular-season pennant and finished third in attendance (75,000) in the six-team league. But the following season, a poor club on the field resulted in a severe attendance decline, and the Giants moved to <a href="Victoria,_Texas" title="wikilink">Victoria, Texas</a>, in mid-June. Harlingen has since had clubs in the <a href="Gulf_States_League" title="wikilink">Gulf States League</a> and the <a href="Lone_Star_League" title="wikilink">Lone Star League</a> of the 1970s and in independent leagues since 1994.</p>
