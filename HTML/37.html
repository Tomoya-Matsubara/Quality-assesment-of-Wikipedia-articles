<p><strong>Skewball</strong> was the name of a British <a href="racehorse" class="uri" title="wikilink">racehorse</a>, most famous as the subject of a <a href="ballad" class="uri" title="wikilink">ballad</a>. The horse was born in 1741, and originally owned by Francis, 2nd <a href="Earl_of_Godolphin" title="wikilink">Earl of Godolphin</a>, and later sold. His name has been recorded as &quot;Squball&quot;, &quot;Sku-ball&quot;, or &quot;<strong>Stewball</strong>&quot;. He won many races in England, and a famous one in Ireland, which is generally the subject of the song of the same name. Popular legend has Skewball belonging to an Arthur Marvell. Based on the horse's name, Skewball was likely a <a href="skewbald" class="uri" title="wikilink">skewbald</a> horse, though there is speculation that he was a <a href="Bay_(color)" title="wikilink">bay</a>.</p>
<h2 id="songs">Songs</h2>
<p>There are two major different versions of the <a href="Sporting_song" title="wikilink">sporting ballad</a>, generally titled either &quot;Skewball&quot; or &quot;Stewball&quot;; the latter is more popular in America. There are multiple variations within the two major divisions. Versions date at least as far back as the 18th century, appearing on numerous <a href="broadside_(music)" title="wikilink">broadsides</a>. In both songs the title horse is the underdog in the race, up against a favored grey mare (usually called either &quot;Griselda&quot; or &quot;Molly&quot;), and although in most versions of Stewball the winning horse triumphs due to the stumbling of the lead horse, Skewball wins simply by being the faster horse in the end. Probably the most significant lyrical difference in the songs is the conversation Skewball has with his jockey, while Stewball behaves more like a typical horse and does not speak.</p>
<p>American versions were sung and adapted by slaves in the Southern United States, and have Stewball racing in <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>, <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a>, and <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a>. British versions, when the setting is mentioned, often place the race in <a href="Kildare" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kildare</a>, <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>, leading some to believe that the song is actually Irish in origin. The fact that these accounts still imply that the horse's nationality was English, and they celebrate a victory over a horse that is presumably Irish, makes it likely the song is originally English, and its setting in Ireland is due to it being the site of Skewball's most famous race.</p>
<h2 id="recordings">Recordings</h2>
<p>&quot;...comes aprancin' and adancin' my darling Stewball.&quot;</p>
<p>A notable recording is by American folk legend <a href="Woody_Guthrie" title="wikilink">Woody Guthrie</a>, who included an English and an American interpretation (both entitled Stewball) on tape and recorded in Volume 4 of <a href="The_Asch_Recordings" title="wikilink">The Asch Recordings</a> (<a href="1930" class="uri" title="wikilink">1930</a>-<a href="1940" class="uri" title="wikilink">1940</a>). The American interpretation is sung with an African American '<a href="call_and_response_(music)" title="wikilink">call and response</a>' style while the English interpretation has a more traditional folk style. The American interpretation has Stewball as being born in California with the famed race against the grey mare taking place in <a href="Dallas,_Texas" title="wikilink">Dallas, Texas</a>. This version of the song was popularized by Texas singer/songwriter <a href="Robert_Earl_Keen" title="wikilink">Robert Earl Keen</a>, in <a href="The_Live_Album" title="wikilink">The Live Album</a> performance at Dallas's <a href="Sons_of_Hermann_Hall" title="wikilink">Sons of Hermann Hall</a>.</p>
<p>Another notable version of &quot;Stewball&quot; was recorded by <a href="John_Herald" title="wikilink">John Herald</a> and the <a href="Greenbriar_Boys" title="wikilink">Greenbriar Boys</a>, and popularized by <a href="Peter,_Paul_and_Mary" title="wikilink">Peter, Paul and Mary</a>. <a href="The_Weavers" title="wikilink">The Weavers</a> and <a href="Lonnie_Donegan" title="wikilink">Lonnie Donegan</a> recorded it in the 1950s. Other versions include <a href="Joan_Baez" title="wikilink">Joan Baez</a>' on <em><a href="Joan_Baez/5" title="wikilink">Joan Baez/5</a></em> (1964) and <a href="The_Hollies" title="wikilink">The Hollies</a> on <a href="Would_You_Believe" title="wikilink">Would You Believe</a> (1966). The 1971 <a href="John_Lennon" title="wikilink">John Lennon</a> song &quot;<a href="Happy_Xmas_(War_Is_Over)" title="wikilink">Happy Xmas (War Is Over)</a>&quot; has a similar meter and tune <a href="http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/VOLUME01/Baroque_Folk_Lennon.html">1</a>. Popular British versions include recordings by <a href="A._L._Lloyd" title="wikilink">A. L. Lloyd</a>, <a href="Martin_Carthy" title="wikilink">Martin Carthy</a>, and <a href="Steeleye_Span" title="wikilink">Steeleye Span</a> on the album <em><a href="Ten_Man_Mop,_or_Mr._Reservoir_Butler_Rides_Again" title="wikilink">Ten Man Mop, or Mr. Reservoir Butler Rides Again</a></em>. An American version following the British tradition is recorded by <a href="Broadside_Electric" title="wikilink">Broadside Electric</a> on <a href="Black-edged_Visiting_Card" title="wikilink">Black-edged Visiting Card</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, a <a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French</a> cover has been recorded by <a href="Hugues_Aufray" title="wikilink">Hugues Aufray</a>, becoming one of Aufray's biggest hits. However, this version is unlike the English versions. Aufray's version of the song takes the perspective of a man recalling an experience as a ten-year old boy. His father believes that Stewball will win a race, so he puts all his money and assets into this venture. Toward the end of the race, Stewball tragically falls. The veterinarian finishes him off with a single shot. This is the first time that the narrator witnesses his father cry. Aufray's version is very different from other interpretations in that it features Stewball not winning his race and dying due to an injury.</p>
