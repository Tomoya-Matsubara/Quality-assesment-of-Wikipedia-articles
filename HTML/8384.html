<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>
<p>The <a href="Argentine_Culture#Cinema_and_theatre" title="wikilink">theatre in Argentina</a> had developed alongside the nation's emergence as a modern economy in the late 19<small><sup>th</sup></small> and early 20<small><sup>th</sup></small> centuries. Independent and <a href="experimental_theatre" title="wikilink">experimental theatre</a>, however, had long endured in the shadows of commercial productions (for which Buenos Aires' <a href="Corrientes_Avenue" title="wikilink">Corrientes Avenue</a> became particularly well-known). Many of the playwrights prominent in this movement were also politically opinionated, and their plays' left-leaning subtext were frowned upon by powerful figures in the <a href="Argentine_military" title="wikilink">Argentine military</a> and the publishing sector, alike. Increasing repression became a serious threat to artistic freedom in the years shortly before and during the country's <a href="National_Reorganization_Process" title="wikilink">last dictatorship</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

Playwright <a href="Osvaldo_Drag&lt;U+00FA&gt;n" title="wikilink">Osvaldo Drag&lt;U+00FA&gt;n</a> seized the opportunity to organize a new theatre movement, calling on fellow playwrights <a href="Roberto_Cossa" title="wikilink">Roberto Cossa</a> and <a href="Carlos_Gorostiza" title="wikilink">Carlos Gorostiza</a>, as well as renowned theatre actors <a href="Luis_Brandoni" title="wikilink">Luis Brandoni</a>, <a href="Jorge_Rivera_L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez" title="wikilink">Jorge Rivera L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez</a> and <a href="Pepe_Soriano" title="wikilink">Pepe Soriano</a>. They purchased a shuttered sparkplug factory on <a href="Santos_Disc&lt;U+00E9&gt;polo_Way" title="wikilink">Santos Disc&lt;U+00E9&gt;polo Way</a> (a pedestrianized backstreet in the crowded <a href="Balvanera" class="uri" title="wikilink">Balvanera</a> district of Buenos Aires) into the &quot;Picadero Theatre.&quot; Honored by the presence and support of <a href="Nobel_Prize" title="wikilink">Nobel</a> laureate <a href="Adolfo_P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rez_Esquivel" title="wikilink">Adolfo P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rez Esquivel</a> and writer <a href="Ernesto_S&lt;U+00E1&gt;bato" title="wikilink">Ernesto S&lt;U+00E1&gt;bato</a>, the group announced, in a May 12, 1981, press conference, the establishment of the <em>Teatro Abierto Argentino</em> - the &quot;Argentine Open Theatre.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Sensitive both to the repressive climate and to the sharp <a href="Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Alfredo_Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;nez_de_Hoz" title="wikilink">economic crisis</a>, playwright <a href="Carlos_Somigliana" title="wikilink">Carlos Somigliana</a> penned the Open Theatre's mission statement, declaring that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Being the theatre the cultural and social phenomenon that it is, we shall strive to recover the public at large with productions of great quality and modestly-priced tickets.</em><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They premiered their first festival on July 28, 1981, featuring Cossa's <em>Gris de ausencia</em> (<em>Pale of Absence</em>), Drag&lt;U+00FA&gt;n's <em>Mi obelisco y yo</em> (<em>My Obelisk and Me</em>) and Gorostiza's <em>El acompa&lt;U+00F1&gt;amiento</em> (<em>The Entourage</em>) among the evening's repertoire. During an August 6 performance, however, three fire bombs were set off in the theatre, casting doubts on the company's viability (the incident remains one of Argentina's best-known &quot;unsolved mysteries&quot;). Sixteen prominent Buenos Aires theatres offered them their stages, however, and the Open Theatre relocated to the larger <a href="Tabaris_Theatre" title="wikilink">Tabaris Theatre</a>, a Corrientes Avenue landmark known for its <a href="revue" class="uri" title="wikilink">revue</a>. The Open Theatre reopened two days later and its 1981 season ran until September 21, featuring 21 directors, over 150 cast and crew, and bringing together some 25,000 spectators.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Organizer Osvaldo Drag&lt;U+00FA&gt;n delared that <em>&quot;today the open theatre belongs to the entire nation.&quot;</em><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="winning-back-the-streets">Winning back the streets</h3>
<p>The ongoing economic collapse and replacement of President Viola for the hard-line General <a href="Leopoldo_Galtieri" title="wikilink">Leopoldo Galtieri</a> led the company to plan the 1982 season with more precautions. Playwrights were invited to submit works well in advance, and the repertoire was expanded to include works of <a href="experimental_theatre" title="wikilink">experimental theatre</a>. Playwright <a href="Ricardo_Monti" title="wikilink">Ricardo Monti</a> contributed to the effort by publishing the &quot;Open Theatre Magazine,&quot; a quarterly publication. The magazine provided a forum for potential participants as much as it prudently kept authorities abreast of its developments. Other fund-raising efforts included a coffee-table book, <em>Teatro Abierto 1981</em>, which sold 8,000 copies. None of the participants accepted compensation beyond covering their personal expenses related to the event, and any surplus profits were returned to the struggling company's funds.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The Open Theatre's 1982 season, whose slogan was &quot;winning back the streets,&quot; opened in late September with Drag&lt;U+00FA&gt;n's <em>Al violador</em> (<em>To the Rapist</em>), <a href="Eugenio_Griffero" title="wikilink">Eugenio Griffero</a>'s provocative look at gay life in Argentina, <em>Pr&lt;U+00ED&gt;ncipe azul</em> (<em>Blue Prince</em>) and Somigliana's daring criticism of the military, <em>Oficial primero</em> (&quot;Commissioned Officer&quot;), among other works from 30 other directors. Controversy ensued, however, when a number of well-known directors' works were passed over, notably <a href="Pacho_O&#39;Donnell" title="wikilink">Pacho O'Donnell</a>'s, and negative national sentiment at the heels of the disastrous <a href="Falklands_War" title="wikilink">Falklands War</a> helped further dampen interest in the season, which closed in November.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1983 season was produced in the Margarita Xirgu Theatre amid Argentina's imminent <a href="Argentine_general_election,_1983" title="wikilink">return to democracy</a>, and its featured plays were more politically daring than those of the two previous seasons. Drag&lt;U+00FA&gt;n's <em>Hoy se comen al flaco</em> (<em>Today They'll Take the Skinny Guy</em>) headlined the opening night on September 24, and other works included odes to tragedies in <a href="Chile_under_Pinochet" title="wikilink">Chile</a> and <a href="Nicaraguan_Revolution" title="wikilink">Nicaragua</a>. Banned by the dictatorship, <a href="murga" title="wikilink">murgas</a> were included in the season as theatrical works. The <a href="carnival" class="uri" title="wikilink">carnival</a>-like marches often paraded out of the theatre house, itself, and often included banned left-wing themes.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The season concluded with a murga marching against censorship, and the burning of an effigy to censorship (&quot;La Censurona&quot;).<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-theatre-strikes-back">The theatre strikes back</h3>
<p><em>El teatrazo</em> (&quot;The Attack of the Theatre&quot;) as the slogan of the 1984 season was thought of by its organizers as way to &quot;share our opinion in the context of liberty.&quot; The return of democracy, however, also helped deprive the festival of its status as the leading forum for artistic defiance of a repressive regime; indeed, one of the Open Theatre's leading figures, <a href="Carlos_Gorostiza" title="wikilink">Carlos Gorostiza</a>, had been appointed Secretary of Culture by newly-elected President <a href="Ra&lt;U+00FA&gt;l_Alfons&lt;U+00ED&gt;n" title="wikilink">Ra&lt;U+00FA&gt;l Alfons&lt;U+00ED&gt;n</a>. Following the failure of the 1984 season, musch of which was cancelled, the company dedicated its 1985 season to young playwrights. That season featured works from throughout <a href="Latin_American_literature" title="wikilink">Latin America</a> and, opening on September 21, it was more successful than its predecessor; but a sixth season was cancelled, leaving the Open Theatre a place in Argentine history as &quot;a modest popular resistance and, among the cultural ones, the most visible.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
