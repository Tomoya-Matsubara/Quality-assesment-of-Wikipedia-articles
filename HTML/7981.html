<p><strong>James Clark</strong> (January 16, 1779 &lt;U+2013&gt; August 27, 1839) was a 19th century <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> politician who served in all <a href="Separation_of_powers_under_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">three branches</a> of <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a>'s government and in the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">U.S. House of Representatives</a>. His political career began in the <a href="Kentucky_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Kentucky House of Representatives</a> in 1807. In 1810, he was appointed to the <a href="Kentucky_Court_of_Appeals" title="wikilink">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a>, where he served for two years before resigning to pursue a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He served two terms in that body, resigning in 1816.</p>
<p>Clark accepted an appointment to the <a href="circuit_court" title="wikilink">circuit court</a> of <a href="Bourbon_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Bourbon</a> and <a href="Clark_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Clark</a> counties in 1817. It was in this capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred. In 1822, he <a href="Judicial_review_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">struck down</a> a debt relief law in the case of <em>Williams v. Blair</em> on the basis that it impeded the <a href="Contract_Clause" title="wikilink">obligation of contracts</a>. His decision was unpopular with the legislature, who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it. An attempt to <a href="impeachment" title="wikilink">remove him from office</a> fell short of the needed <a href="two-thirds_majority" title="wikilink">two-thirds majority</a>. The following year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark's ruling. In retaliation, the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one more sympathetic to their views. This event and its aftermath became known as the <a href="Old_Court-New_Court_controversy" title="wikilink">Old Court-New Court controversy</a>.</p>
<p>In 1825, Clark was chosen to fill the congressional seat vacated by <a href="Henry_Clay" title="wikilink">Henry Clay</a>'s elevation to <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_State" title="wikilink">Secretary of State</a>. He served until 1831, but did not stand for re-election that year. He became active in organizing the <a href="Whig_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Whig Party</a> in Kentucky, and was rewarded for his efforts by being chosen as the party's nominee for governor in 1836. He won the election and laid out an ambitious <a href="Party_platform" title="wikilink">platform</a> to the legislature, which acted on only part of it. Clark's most significant accomplishment as governor was securing the creation of a state <a href="board_of_education" title="wikilink">board of education</a> and the establishment of public schools in every county in the state. Clark died in office in 1839. His estate, <a href="Governor_Clark_House" title="wikilink">Holly Rood</a>, is listed on the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a>.</p>

<p>In 1825, Clark was elected to fill the U.S. House seat left vacant by the elevation of <a href="Henry_Clay" title="wikilink">Henry Clay</a> to <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_State" title="wikilink">Secretary of State</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> He was twice re-elected, and chaired the Committee on Territories.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He refused re-nomination in 1831.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="governor-of-kentucky">Governor of Kentucky</h3>
<p>Clark helped organize the <a href="Whig_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Whig Party</a> in Kentucky, and as a reward, he was chosen as the party's nominee for governor in 1836.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> He won the canvass, defeating <a href="United_States_Democratic_Party" title="wikilink">Democrat</a> Matthew Flournoy 38,587 to 30,491.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> In his address to the legislature, he outlined an ambitious agenda of reforms, including the establishing a public school system, strengthening the office of state auditor, and combating an increase in crime.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Believing that banks should be held to their responsibilities, he insisted that the state banks not suspend <a href="specie" class="uri" title="wikilink">specie</a> payments.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> He also strongly believed in the rights of slave owners, and encouraged <a href="Ohio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ohio</a>, <a href="Indiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indiana</a>, and <a href="Illinois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Illinois</a> to cooperate in returning escaped slaves.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>The legislature heeded some of Clark's message. They added a second auditor in the office of the state auditor, and gave greater discretion to the state's <a href="sinking_fund" title="wikilink">sinking fund</a> commission.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> They created a state board of education and the office of state superintendent.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> They also created county school commissioners in every county.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> In response to his remarks on slave property, the legislature enacted laws that raised the reward for apprehending a fugitive slave and made it illegal for <a href="stagecoach" class="uri" title="wikilink">stagecoach</a> owners to allow fugitive slaves to use their coaches to escape.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> However, they refused to restrict the publication and spread of <a href="abolitionism" title="wikilink">abolitionist</a> <a href="propaganda" class="uri" title="wikilink">propaganda</a> in the state, as Clark had requested, and they ignored most of his recommendations in other areas.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Clark financed <a href="internal_improvements" title="wikilink">internal improvements</a> in the state through the sale of bonds.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
