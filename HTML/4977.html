<p>James Keenan was born in <a href="Ravenna,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Ravenna</a>, Ohio, on April 17, 1964, the only child of Judith Marie and Michael Loren Keenan. When his parents divorced in 1968, his father, a high school teacher, moved to <a href="Michigan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Michigan</a> and Keenan would only see him about once a year for the next 12 years. His mother remarried, bringing Keenan into an &quot;intolerant and unworldly household&quot;, where his intelligence and creative expression would be stifled.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> When Keenan was 11, his mother suffered a paralyzing <a href="cerebral_aneurysm" title="wikilink">cerebral aneurysm</a>, which would later serve as the inspiration for many of his creative works.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> A few years later, she persuaded Keenan to live with his father in Michigan. Keenan considers this &quot;the best move [he] ever made.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="Bill_Murray" title="wikilink">Bill Murray</a>'s performance in the 1981 comedy film <em><a href="Stripes_(film)" title="wikilink">Stripes</a></em>, Keenan joined the <a href="United_States_Army" title="wikilink">United States Army</a>, with the intention of having the <a href="G.I._Bill" title="wikilink">G.I. Bill</a> fund his dream of attending <a href="art_school" title="wikilink">art school</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> By this point, he had lived in Ohio, Michigan, <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a>, <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, <a href="Oklahoma" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="Kansas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kansas</a>, and <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He initially served in the Army as a <a href="Artillery_observer" title="wikilink">forward observer</a> before studying at the <a href="United_States_Military_Academy_Preparatory_School" title="wikilink">United States Military Academy Preparatory School</a> (West Point Prep School) from 1983 to 1984. In addition to completing a rigorous math and English curriculum, he ran on the cross country team and sang in the <a href="glee_club" title="wikilink">glee club</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> It was during his time in the military that he adopted the <a href="sobriquet" class="uri" title="wikilink">sobriquet</a> &quot;Maynard&quot; on a whim.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He was distinguished in basic and advanced training,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> but declined an appointment to <a href="United_States_Military_Academy" title="wikilink">West Point</a> and instead chose to pursue a music career because of his disillusionment with his colleagues' values<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and because he knew West Point would not tolerate his dissidence.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Upon completing his term of enlistment, he studied art at <a href="Kendall_College_of_Art_and_Design" title="wikilink">Kendall College of Art and Design</a> in <a href="Grand_Rapids,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Grand Rapids, Michigan</a>. In 1988, he relocated to Los Angeles where his love of animals led him to practice interior design for pet stores,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> before he was quickly fired and began working in <a href="set_construction" title="wikilink">set construction</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> During the 1980s, Keenan played <a href="bass_guitar" title="wikilink">bass guitar</a> for TexA.N.S. and sang for Children of the Anachronistic Dynasty, both independent bands.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>After moving to Los Angeles, Keenan met <a href="Adam_Jones" title="wikilink">Adam Jones</a> who had heard him singing on a <a href="Demo_(music)" title="wikilink">demo</a> in college. Impressed with Keenan's vocals, Jones suggested that they form a band. Although reluctant at first,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Keenan agreed and, in 1990, Tool was formed. Fronted by Keenan, the eventual lineup included <a href="guitarist" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitarist</a> Jones; his neighbor, <a href="drummer" class="uri" title="wikilink">drummer</a> <a href="Danny_Carey" title="wikilink">Danny Carey</a>; and <a href="bassist" class="uri" title="wikilink">bassist</a> <a href="Paul_D&#39;Amour" title="wikilink">Paul D'Amour</a>, who would later be replaced by <a href="Justin_Chancellor" title="wikilink">Justin Chancellor</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>Tool signed to <a href="Zoo_Entertainment" title="wikilink">Zoo Entertainment</a> in November 1991 and released the <em><a href="Opiate_(EP)" title="wikilink">Opiate</a></em> EP the following year. To support this release, the band toured with <a href="Fishbone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fishbone</a> and <a href="Rage_Against_the_Machine" title="wikilink">Rage Against the Machine</a>. During a 1993 show at the <a href="Church_of_Scientology" title="wikilink">Church of Scientology</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="Celebrity_Centre" title="wikilink">Celebrity Centre</a> in Los Angeles, Keenan (who would later write the lyrics &quot;Fuck <a href="L._Ron_Hubbard" title="wikilink">L. Ron Hubbard</a> and fuck all his clones&quot; in &quot;<a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;nema" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;nema</a>&quot;) bleated like a sheep for a good portion of the show. &quot;Before our set this guy tries to intimidate me by showing me a gun in his jacket,&quot; Keenan recalled. &quot;I explained to him that if he pissed me off I&lt;U+2019&gt;d start a riot.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Tool released their 1993 debut album, <em><a href="Undertow_(Tool_album)" title="wikilink">Undertow</a></em>, in the United States. It was certified gold after just eight months, and platinum less than a year later.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In 1994, the band released their single &quot;<a href="Prison_Sex_(song)" title="wikilink">Prison Sex</a>&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;a song in which Keenan opted to deliver in a slight grunge-style&lt;U+2014&gt;with a corresponding music video created and directed by Jones. The video was deemed &quot;too graphic and offensive&quot;,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and was withdrawn by <a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a> after a few airings due to &quot;a symbolic dealing with the sensitive subject of child abuse&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>In October 1996, the band released their second studio album, <em><a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;nima" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;nima</a></em>. The album was certified gold in ten weeks, achieved double platinum in ten months,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> and won the <a href="Grammy_Award_for_Best_Metal_Performance" title="wikilink">Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance</a> in 1998.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> After the release of the album, Tool began a prolonged legal battle with their label, <a href="Volcano_Records" title="wikilink">Volcano Records</a> (formerly Zoo Records), over contract violations. Following this legal battle, which resulted in a new three-record deal,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> the members of Tool decided to take some time off. During the hiatus, the band members were outspokenly critical of <a href="peer-to-peer_file_sharing" title="wikilink">peer-to-peer file sharing</a> networks, due to the negative financial impact on artists dependent on success in record sales. During an interview with <em><a href="NY_Rock" title="wikilink">NY Rock</a></em> in 2000, Keenan stated, &quot;I think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed. The ones who get hurt by <a href="MP3" title="wikilink">MP3s</a> are not so much companies or the business, but the artists, people who are trying to write songs.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>Five years after the release of <em>&lt;U+00C6&gt;nima</em>, Tool announced a new album, <em>Systema Enc&lt;U+00E9&gt;phale</em>, with a 12-song tracklist in January 2001.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> A month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled <em><a href="Lateralus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lateralus</a></em> and that the previous announcement had been a ruse.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The album was released in May 2001 to positive reviews. Known for his &quot;dark, intelligent, compelling, and unexpected lyrical twists&quot;,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Keenan was acclaimed for his songwriting on the album, in which he &quot;doesn&lt;U+2019&gt;t cross the line from darkness to ugliness ... as often as he has in the past&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In an interview with <em>NY Rock</em>, Keenan explained, &quot;Everything we release with Tool is inspired by our music. It doesn't matter if it is a video or if its lyrics. The lyrics for &quot;<a href="Schism_(song)" title="wikilink">Schism</a>&quot; are nothing more than my interpretation of the music.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The album became a worldwide success, reaching #1 on the U.S. <a href="Billboard_200" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> 200</a> albums chart in its debut week,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and Tool received their second Grammy Award for the best metal performance of 2001 for &quot;Schism&quot;.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In 2002, Keenan recorded a song called &quot;Fallen&quot; with <a href="30_Seconds_to_Mars" title="wikilink">30 Seconds to Mars</a> that was released on the band's <a href="30_Seconds_to_Mars_(album)" title="wikilink">self-titled debut album</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Fifteen years after the band's formation, Tool had acquired what Dan Epstein of <em><a href="Revolver_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Revolver</a></em> described as a devoted &quot;<a href="Cult_following" title="wikilink">cult</a>&quot; following,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and in May 2006 the band released <em><a href="10,000_Days" title="wikilink">10,000 Days</a></em>, an album in which Keenan sang about more personal issues in contrast to previous attempts to inspire change.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> His mother, who inspired the song &quot;jimmy&quot; on <em>&lt;U+00C6&gt;nima</em>, also served as the inspiration for the two-part song &quot;Wings for Marie&quot; and &quot;10,000 Days (Wings for Marie, Pt 2)&quot;,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> which deals with her 2003 death after 27 years, or around 10,000 days, of suffering.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The album sold 564,000 copies in its opening week in the U.S. and was #1 on the <em>Billboard</em> 200 charts.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> However, <em>10,000 Days</em> was received less favorably by critics than its predecessor <em>Lateralus</em> had been.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Following <em>10,000 Days</em>, Tool has one album remaining to fulfill the obligation of its record contract. Though there is little information available on plans for this album, the band is steadily working towards its fifth studio release.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Tool has worked around Keenan and his side projects since 1999, starting with the creation of <a href="A_Perfect_Circle" title="wikilink">A Perfect Circle</a>, which has led to several years between projects. Regarding the future of Tool, Keenan stated in a 2007 interview with <em>Spin</em>, &quot;We'll make music together until one of us is dead.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>On March 24, 2009, a summer tour was announced on Tool's website,<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and in a March 26 press release Tool was confirmed as a headliner for the second annual <a href="Mile_High_Music_Festival" title="wikilink">Mile High Music Festival</a> in <a href="Commerce_City,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Commerce City</a>, <a href="Colorado" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colorado</a>, with <a href="Widespread_Panic" title="wikilink">Widespread Panic</a> and <a href="The_Fray" title="wikilink">The Fray</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Tool also headlined <a href="List_of_Lollapalooza_lineups_by_year#2009" title="wikilink">Lollapalooza 2009</a> in <a href="Chicago,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Chicago</a>, <a href="Illinois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Illinois</a>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="a-perfect-circle">A Perfect Circle</h3>


<p>During Tool's post-<em>&lt;U+00C6&gt;nima</em> hiatus to deal with their legal issues, Keenan began working with <a href="Billy_Howerdel" title="wikilink">Billy Howerdel</a>, Tool's <a href="Guitar_technician" title="wikilink">guitar tech</a> through the <em>&lt;U+00C6&gt;nima</em> tour, on a different project. The <a href="Supergroup_(music)" title="wikilink">supergroup</a> they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album <em><a href="Mer_de_Noms" title="wikilink">Mer de Noms</a></em> in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled <em><a href="Thirteenth_Step" title="wikilink">Thirteenth Step</a></em>, a reference to <a href="twelve-step_program" title="wikilink">twelve-step programs</a> (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery).<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Both albums were eventually certified platinum. Their subsequent 2004 album, <em><a href="Emotive_(album)" title="wikilink">Emotive</a></em>, was primarily composed of covers, except for the singles &quot;<a href="Counting_Bodies_Like_Sheep_to_the_Rhythm_of_the_War_Drums" title="wikilink">Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums</a>&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;a song inspired by &quot;Pet&quot; that was originally released on <em>Thirteenth Step</em>&lt;U+2014&gt;and &quot;Passive&quot;. Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he &quot;tested the waters&quot; and was subsequently &quot;crucified&quot; for it because of the content.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled <em><a href="Amotion" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amotion</a></em>, which was certified platinum within a month of its release.</p>
<p>Despite its success, the future of A Perfect Circle remains uncertain. It is currently on hiatus, partly due to Keenan's commitments to Tool; Howerdel reported in a May 2006 interview with MTV that the supergroup's work was concluded for the time being.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> After more than two years since the bands last release, Keenan was asked about the status of A Perfect Circle during an interview with <em><a href="Revolver_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Revolver</a></em>. He stated:</p>

<p>When asked, in an interview for <em><a href="Spin_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Spin</a></em> that same month, about the possibility of another A Perfect Circle album, Keenan stated, &quot;Maybe, someday, a song on a soundtrack. But an album? No.&quot;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> A year later, on December 9, 2008, <a href="blabbermouth.net" class="uri" title="wikilink">blabbermouth.net</a> reported that Keenan had announced on The Pulse of Radio that he and Howerdel have been writing new music for A Perfect Circle. Keenan also said that the band has no plans to resume full-scale touring, or even to write and record a new album. Instead, they will focus on &quot;one or two songs at a time&quot;, which will most likely be released via the Internet.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>On August 2, 2010, a seemingly official (but not &quot;verified&quot;) <a href="Twitter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Twitter</a> account for the band was launched with a tweet reading: &quot;It's on.&quot; The tweet also linked to the Twitter accounts of Keenan, Howerdel and Puscifer. The following day the account tweeted, &quot;Go tell Aunt Rosie... The old grey goose is dead not,&quot; linking to more accounts including those of Danny Lohner and Josh Freese.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a>. It is believed that both Freese and James Iha (the latter of whom still refers to himself as a current member of APC) will both be involved. That same day Billy Howerdel tweeted &quot;The APC dust is shaking off!&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="puscifer">Puscifer</h3>

<p>In 2003, Keenan surfaced under the name &quot;Puscifer&quot; for the song &quot;REV 22:20&quot; on the <em><a href="Underworld_(soundtrack)" title="wikilink">Underworld</a></em> film soundtrack. Puscifer was once advertised as a side project with <a href="Danny_Lohner" title="wikilink">Danny Lohner</a>, who had formerly performed live with <a href="Nine_Inch_Nails" title="wikilink">Nine Inch Nails</a>, but has since been formed as a manifestation of Keenan's &quot;creative subconscious&quot;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a>&lt;U+2014&gt;meaning that Keenan is now using the name as a <a href="pseudonym" class="uri" title="wikilink">pseudonym</a> for his solo work. Keenan has stated that it is &quot;a premiere improvisational hardcore band&quot;,<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> and his &quot;catch-all, <a href="Stream_of_consciousness_(psychology)" title="wikilink">stream of consciousness</a>, anything goes, etc.&quot; project.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> When comparing the project to Tool in an interview with <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em>, Keenan described it as his &quot;attempt to make music to inspire people. ... This is definitely not thinking man's music, but groove-oriented music that makes you feel good.&quot;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> In a later interview with <a href="Artistdirect" class="uri" title="wikilink">Artistdirect</a>, Keenan said that he did not want the lyrics to be puzzles.

<p>Puscifer continued to perform with a revolving lineup throughout 2009 at venues around the Southwest. However, in a November 2009 interview, Keenan stated: &quot;Efforts to confine our beloved enigma to the Southwestern United States have been thwarted. We are compelled beyond all reason to bring the noise Eastward and share our special sauce.

<h3 id="writing-and-performance-style">Writing and performance style</h3>
<p>A primary purpose of Keenan's lyrics for Tool involves a desire to connect with the listeners on a personal level; to encourage them to look within themselves for self-identity, understanding and reflection.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Tool does not include lyrics with any releases as Keenan believes most people &quot;don't get it&quot; and it is not a priority of the band that people do.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> However, after each release Keenan has eventually published his typed lyrics online via the semi-official fansite, with the exception of &quot;<a href="Lateralus_(song)" title="wikilink">Lateralus</a>&quot;, which was published on the official Tool website.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Lyrical arrangements are often given special attention, such as in the lyrics to &quot;Lateralus&quot;, wherein the number of syllables per line correspond to an arrangement of the <a href="Fibonacci_number" title="wikilink">Fibonacci numbers</a>,<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> and &quot;Jambi&quot;, in which the metrical foot <a href="iamb" class="uri" title="wikilink">iamb</a> is used.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Keenan's lyrics on <em>&lt;U+00C6&gt;nima</em> and <em>Lateralus</em> focused on philosophy and spirituality&lt;U+2014&gt;specific subjects range from organized <a href="religion" class="uri" title="wikilink">religion</a> in &quot;Opiate&quot;, to <a href="evolution" class="uri" title="wikilink">evolution</a> and <a href="Carl_Jung" title="wikilink">Jungian</a> psychology in &quot;<a href="Forty-Six_&amp;_2" title="wikilink">Forty-Six &amp; 2</a>&quot; and <a href="transcendence_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">transcendence</a> in &quot;Lateralus&quot;.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>In live performances with Tool, Keenan has often been known to be situated on a platform towards the rear of the stage,<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> without a <a href="Stage_lighting_instrument#Spotlights" title="wikilink">spotlight</a>,<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> facing the backdrop rather than the audience.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Breckinridge Haggerty, the band's live video director, says that the dark spaces on stage &quot;are mostly for Maynard&quot;.

He needs a bit of personal space, and he feels more comfortable in the shadows.&quot;<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> An exception, which surprised even hardcore Tool fans, occurred when a fan climbed on stage and attempted to hug Keenan during the band's performance of &quot;Pushit&quot;. After picking the fan up and dropping him to the ground, Keenan wrapped himself around the man's back. He eventually turned the fan to his stomach and sat on his back, where he stayed for &quot;an uncomfortably long period of time.&quot;<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> His appearance with Tool has included the <a href="Mohawk_hairstyle" title="wikilink">Mohawk hairstyle</a>,<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> wigs, <a href="Kabuki" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kabuki</a> masks, <a href="drag_(clothing)" title="wikilink">bras</a>, tights,<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> and his entire body in blue paint.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> This is contrasted with a variety of long haired wigs while performing with or promoting A Perfect Circle.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a><a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> His posture on stage is usually bent.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>Describing Keenan's contribution to Tool and A Perfect Circle, <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> wrote that &quot;both groups rely on Mr. Keenan's ability to dignify emotions like lust, anger and disgust, the honey in his voice adding a touch of profundity&quot;.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Keenan's ability as a vocalist has been lauded by the <em><a href="Seattle_Post-Intelligencer" title="wikilink">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a></em>: after his performance during an <a href="Alice_in_Chains" title="wikilink">Alice in Chains</a> reunion concert in 2005, freelance journalist Travis Hay saw him as &quot;a natural fit at replacing <a href="Layne_Staley" title="wikilink">Layne Staley</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> His unique style of singing has often been considered influential to artists such as <a href="Pete_Loeffler" title="wikilink">Pete Loeffler</a> of <a href="Chevelle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chevelle</a>.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="comedy-and-acting">Comedy and acting</h2>
<p>Keenan became friends with comedian <a href="Bill_Hicks" title="wikilink">Bill Hicks</a> in the early 1990s. Keenan did sketch comedy on <a href="Improvisational_comedy" title="wikilink">improv</a> nights in comedy clubs in Los Angeles during that time.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> The two became acquainted and Hicks later <a href="opening_act" title="wikilink">opened</a> some Tool concerts. Best known is a <a href="Comedy_routine" title="wikilink">routine</a> Hicks did while on tour with Tool during the <a href="Lollapalooza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lollapalooza</a> tour in 1993, when he asked the audience to look for a <a href="contact_lens" title="wikilink">contact lens</a> he had lost. Keenan enjoyed this joke so much that he repeated it on a number of occasions.</p>
<p>Keenan is featured in several segments of <em><a href="Mr._Show" title="wikilink">Mr. Show</a></em>,<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> most notably in the <a href="Ronnie_Dobbs" title="wikilink">Ronnie Dobbs</a> sketch presented in the first season. In one scene, he is seen being arrested with Dobbs. Later in the sketch he is featured wearing a wig as the lead singer of the then-fictitious band &quot;<a href="Puscifer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Puscifer</a>&quot;. When asked about the arrest of Dobbs, Keenan replies &quot;Guilty? Yeah. I'm sure he's guilty but... he <em>knows</em> it. I mean, you're guilty, and you don't know it. So... who's really in jail?&quot; He also appears in episode 2.6, &quot;The Velveteen Touch of a Dandy Fop&quot;, as one of the viewers of <em>Coupon: The Movie</em>, saying &quot;Now is not the time&quot;, waving the cameras off and slapping the microphone out of his face in disgust after walking out of the theater. Later, Keenan would sing on a track for the <em>Mr. Show</em> incarnation <em><a href="Run_Ronnie_Run" title="wikilink">Run Ronnie Run</a></em>,<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> and appear in the &quot;music video sex scene&quot; on its DVD.

When asked in an interview which role was more difficult, Keenan responded, &quot;Oh, Manson. He&lt;U+2019&gt;s a real person. People know what he looks like, how he talked. With Satan there&lt;U+2019&gt;s so much gray area.&quot;<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p>In the mid-90s, responding to requests for Tool to perform in benefit shows, Keenan created &quot;Free <a href="Frances_Bean" title="wikilink">Frances Bean</a>&quot; tee-shirts to represent his own platform. Frances' mother, <a href="Courtney_Love" title="wikilink">Courtney Love</a>, had previously referred to Keenan as a &quot;media whore&quot; to which he responded, &quot;Isn't that great? I have the distinction of being called a media whore by Courtney Love.&quot;<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> He said that after watching &quot;the tornado that is her mother&quot;, he thought &quot;Oh my God, how is Frances Bean gonna survive this insanity?&quot;<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Although it was started as a simple joke, the tee-shirts were soon in high demand and Keenan was giving them away.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
