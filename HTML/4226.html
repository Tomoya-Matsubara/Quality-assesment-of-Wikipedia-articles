<p>The <strong>2013 Atlantic hurricane season</strong> was the first <a href="Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">Atlantic hurricane season</a> since <a href="1994_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">1994</a> to feature no major hurricanes,{{#tag:ref|A major hurricane is a storm that ranks as Category 3 or higher on the <a href="Saffir-Simpson_hurricane_wind_scale" title="wikilink">Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} and the first since <a href="1968_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">1968</a> to feature no storms of at least Category 2 intensity. The season began on June 1 and ended on November 30, dates that conventionally delimit the period during each year when most <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclones</a> form in the Atlantic Ocean. The first storm of the season, <a href="Tropical_Storm_Andrea_(2013)" title="wikilink">Andrea</a>, developed on June 5, while the final cyclone, an unnamed subtropical storm, dissipated on December 7. Throughout the year, only two storms &lt;U+2013&gt; Humberto and <a href="Hurricane_Ingrid_(2013)" title="wikilink">Ingrid</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; reached hurricane intensity; this was the lowest seasonal total since <a href="1982_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">1982</a>.</p>
<p>Although 15 tropical cyclones developed, several were weak or remained at sea resulting in impact from the season being relatively minimal. Tropical Storm Andrea in early June killed four after making <a href="Landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">landfall</a> in <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a> and moving up the <a href="East_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">East Coast of the United States</a>. In early July, Tropical Storm Chantal moved through the Leeward Islands, causing one fatality, but minimal damage overall. Tropical storms Dorian and Erin, and Hurricane Humberto, all brought squally weather but limited impact to the <a href="Cape_Verde" title="wikilink">Cape Verde Islands</a>. Particularly hit was Mexico, where tropical storms <a href="Tropical_Storm_Barry_(2013)" title="wikilink">Barry</a>, Fernand, Tropical Depression Eight, and Hurricane Ingrid all made landfall. Ingrid especially brought severe impacts, with at least 23 deaths and $1.5 billion (2013 <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">USD</a>) in damage.{{#tag:ref|All damage figures are in 2013 <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">USD</a>, unless otherwise noted|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} In early October, Karen brought showers and gusty winds to the central <a href="Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Gulf Coast of the United States</a>.</p>
<p>All major forecasting agencies predicted an above-average season. On April 10, <a href="Colorado_State_University" title="wikilink">Colorado State University</a> (CSU) forecast eighteen named storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. On May 23, the <a href="National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration" title="wikilink">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (NOAA) predicted a range of thirteen to twenty named storms, seven to eleven hurricanes, and three to six major hurricanes. Following less activity than forecast, both agencies reduced their seasonal predictions in early August; CSU predicted eighteen named storms, eight hurricanes, and three major hurricanes, while NOAA called for thirteen to nineteen named storms, six to nine hurricanes, and three to five major hurricanes. Despite the revisions, activity remained far below predictions, at thirteen named storms, two hurricanes, and no major hurricanes.</p>

<p>In advance of, and during, each hurricane season, several <a href="Tropical_cyclone_seasonal_forecasting" title="wikilink">forecasts of hurricane activity</a> are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts. These include forecasters from the United States <a href="National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration" title="wikilink">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (NOAA)'s <a href="National_Hurricane_Center" title="wikilink">National Hurricane</a> and <a href="Climate_Prediction_Center" title="wikilink">Climate Prediction Center</a>'s, Philip J. Klotzbach, <a href="William_M._Gray" title="wikilink">William M. Gray</a> and their associates at <a href="Colorado_State_University" title="wikilink">Colorado State University</a> (CSU), Tropical Storm Risk, and the United Kingdom's <a href="Met_Office" title="wikilink">Met Office</a>. The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. As stated by NOAA and CSU, an average Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contains roughly 12 tropical storms, six hurricanes, three major hurricanes, and an <a href="Accumulated_Cyclone_Energy" title="wikilink">Accumulated Cyclone Energy</a> (ACE) Index of 66-103 units.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> NOAA typically categorizes a season as either above-average, average, of below-average based on the cumulative ACE Index; however, the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season is considered occasionally as well.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="pre-season-forecasts">Pre-season forecasts</h3>
<p>On December 5, 2012, <em>Tropical Storm Risk</em> (TSR), a public <a href="consortium" class="uri" title="wikilink">consortium</a> consisting of experts on insurance, risk management, and seasonal climate forecasting at <a href="University_College_London" title="wikilink">University College London</a>, issued an extended-range forecast predicting an above-average hurricane season. In its report, the organization called for 15.4 (&lt;U+00B1&gt;4.3) named storms, 7.7 (&lt;U+00B1&gt;2.9) hurricanes, 3.4 (&lt;U+00B1&gt;1.6) major hurricanes, and a cumulative Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index of 134, citing the forecast for slower-than-average trade winds and warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures. While no value was placed on the number of expected landfalls during the season, TSR stated that the landfalling ACE index was expected to be above average.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Four months later, on April 5, Tropical Storm Risk issued its updated forecast, continuing to call for an above-average season with 15.2 (&lt;U+00B1&gt;4.1) named storms, 7.5 (&lt;U+00B1&gt;2.8) hurricanes, 3.4 (&lt;U+00B1&gt;1.6) major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 131; the landfalling ACE index was once again forecast to be higher than normal.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, on April 8, Weather Services International (WSI) issued its first forecast for the hurricane season. In its report, the organization forecasted 16 named storms, nine hurricanes, and five major hurricanes, referencing above average sea surface temperatures in the Main Development Region of the Atlantic. The main forecasting uncertainty involved whether or not an El Ni&lt;U+00F1&gt;o would develop prior to the peak of the season.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> On April 10, Colorado State University (CSU) issued its first forecast for the season, calling for a potentially hyperactive season with 18 named storms, nine hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 165. In its report, the agency stated that above-average sea surface temperatures in the MDR, below-average forecast wind shear, and the unlikeliness of an El Ni&lt;U+00F1&gt;o developing prior to the peak of the season would enhance tropical cyclone activity. The probabilities of a major hurricane hitting the Gulf Coast and East Coast were much above-average, while the probability of a major hurricane hitting anywhere along the USA coastline were well above-average as well.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>On May 15, the United Kingdom <a href="Met_Office" title="wikilink">Met Office</a> (UKMO) issued a forecast of a slightly above-average season. It predicted 14 named storms with a 70% chance that the number would be between 10 and 18 and 9 hurricanes with a 70% chance that the number would be between 4 and 14. It also predicted an ACE index of 130 with a 70% chance that the index would be in the range 76 to 184.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> On May 23, 2013, NOAA issued its first seasonal outlook for the year, stating there was a 70% likelihood of 13 to 20 named storms, of which seven to eleven could become hurricanes, including three to six major hurricanes; these ranges are greater than the seasonal average of twelve named storms, six hurricanes and three major hurricanes. The three main factors contributing to a well above-average to hyperactive hurricane season included above-average sea surface temperatures across much of the Atlantic, the absence of an El Ni&lt;U+00F1&gt;o in the Pacific, and the continuity of the active era since <a href="1995_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">1995</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> On May 30, the Florida State University Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies, FSU COAPS, issued its first and only prediction for the season. The organization called for 12 to 17 named storms, of which five to ten would further intensify into hurricanes; no forecast was given for the number of major hurricanes. In addition, an ACE index of 135 units was forecast. The group attributed its high number of predicted storms to the recent uptick in tropical cyclone activity since 1995.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="mid-season-outlooks">Mid-season outlooks</h3>
<p>On June 3, CSU issued its first mid-season prediction for the remainder of the year. In its report, the organization continued to predict well above-average activity, with eighteen named storms, nine hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 165 units. The two main factors included in the report included the lack of an El Ni&lt;U+00F1&gt;o and warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures across much of the Atlantic. CSU stated that there was a 72% chance of at least one major hurricane impacting any stretch of the United States coastline; the chances of a major hurricane hitting the East Coast and Gulf Coast were 48% and 47%, respectively.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The following day, Tropical Storm Risk issued its third forecast for the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season, calling for sixteen named storms, eight hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE of 134 units; this activity was predicted to be roughly 30% above the 1950-2012 long-term mean. TSR gave a 65% probability that the landfalling ACE index would be above-average. Above-average activity was forecast on the basis of slower-than-average trade winds and warm ocean temperatures.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> A month later, however, TSR lowered its numbers due to predicted cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures and above-average sea surface temperatures.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> On August 2, Colorado State University issued another update for the season. Despite lowering its numbers slightly as a result of anomalous cooling in the eastern subtropical tropical Atlantic, the organization stated that there was an above-average probability of a United States and Caribbean major hurricane landfall.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Finally, on August 8, NOAA issued its second and final outlook for the season, predicting 13 to 19 named storms, six to nine hurricanes, and three to five major hurricanes; these numbers were down ever so slightly from its May outlook.

<p>The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 2013.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> It was an above-average season in which 15 tropical cyclones formed. Fourteen of the fifteen depressions attained tropical storm status.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> However, only two of those became hurricanes, the fewest since <a href="1982_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">1982</a>. Thus, this was the most active season to comprise of two or fewer hurricanes. None intensified into major hurricanes, for the first time since <a href="1994_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">1994</a>. By default, 2013 extended the period of no major hurricane landfalls in the United States to eight years, with the last such system being <a href="Hurricane_Wilma" title="wikilink">Hurricane Wilma</a> in <a href="2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">2005</a>. Further, no hurricane exceeded Category 1 intensity, the first such occurrence since <a href="1968_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">1968</a>. Throughout the season, NOAA and the United States Air Force Reserve flew a total of 45 reconnaissance missions over the Atlantic basin, totaling 435 hours; this was the lowest number of flight hours since at least 1966. The season was most likely above-average because of a lack of <a href="El_Ni&lt;U+00F1&gt;o" title="wikilink">El Ni&lt;U+00F1&gt;o</a>, warmer <a href="sea_surface_temperatures" title="wikilink">sea surface temperatures</a>, lower than average sea-level pressures, and near-normal <a href="wind_shear" title="wikilink">wind shear</a>. However, drier air prevented the development of stronger tropical cyclones.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> One hurricane and three tropical storms made landfall during the season and caused 47 deaths and about $1.51 billion in damage.<ref></p>

<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li><p></ref> Additionally, Tropical Storm Chantal also caused losses and fatalities, though it did not strike land.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The last storm of the season dissipated on December 7,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> over a week after the official end of hurricane season on November 30, 2013.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="Tropical_cyclogenesis" title="wikilink">Tropical cyclogenesis</a> began in early June, with the development of Tropical Storm Andrea in the Gulf of Mexico on June 5. Twelve days later, Tropical Storm Barry formed in the northwestward Caribbean Sea. Two named storms originated in the month of July – tropical storms Chantal and Dorian. Similarly, there were two tropical storms in August, Erin and Fernand. In September, four tropical cyclones formed, three of which strengthened into tropical storms and two of those reached hurricane status. The most intense tropical cyclone – Hurricane Humberto – peaked with <a href="maximum_sustained_wind" title="wikilink">maximum sustained winds</a> of 90 mph (150 km/h) on September 11, which is a Category 1 on the <a href="Saffir&lt;U+2013&gt;Simpson_hurricane_wind_scale" title="wikilink">Saffir&lt;U+2013&gt;Simpson hurricane wind scale</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The other hurricane, Ingrid, was the most devastating storm of the season and peaked at a slightly less intensity.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Activity began to slow in October, with the development of only two tropical storms, Karen and Lorenzo. Tropical cyclogenesis then halted for almost a month, until Tropical Storm Melissa formed over the eastern Atlantic Ocean on November 18. This was the only tropical cyclone in the month of November. The final system was an unnamed subtropical storm that developed south of the Azores on December 5. After meandering for two days, it degenerated into a remnant <a href="Low-pressure_area" title="wikilink">low pressure area</a> on December 7.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="accumulated-cyclone-energy-ace">Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE)</h3>
<p>The season's activity was reflected with an Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) rating of 36, which was well below the 1981–2010 average of 92, and the lowest value since 1994. Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration, such as Humberto, will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39 mph (63 km/h). Accordingly, tropical depressions are not included here. After the storm has dissipated, typically after the end of the season, the NHC reexamines the data, and produces a final report on each storm. These revisions can lead to a revised ACE total either upward or downward compared to the operational value.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="tropical-storm-andrea">Tropical Storm Andrea</h3>


<p>An <a href="low-pressure_area" title="wikilink">area of low pressure</a> in the eastern <a href="Gulf_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Gulf of Mexico</a> developed into Tropical Storm Andrea on June 5. Despite strong <a href="wind_shear" title="wikilink">wind shear</a> and an abundance of dry air, the storm strengthened while initially heading north-northeastward, before recurving northeastward later that day. Andrea intensified and peaked as a strong tropical storm with winds at 65 mph (100 km/h) on June 6. A few hours later, the storm weakened slightly and made <a href="Landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">landfall</a> near <a href="Steinhatchee,_Florida" title="wikilink">Steinhatchee, Florida</a> later that day. It began losing tropical characteristics while tracking across Florida and <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>. Andrea transitioned into an <a href="extratropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">extratropical cyclone</a> over <a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a> on June 7, though the remnants continued to move along the East Coast of the United States until being absorbed by another extratropical system offshore <a href="Maine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maine</a> on June 10.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>The precursor to Andrea dropped nearly 12 inches (300 mm) of rainfall on the Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Peninsula. In Cuba, the storm brought flooding, with over 1,000 people fleeing their homes, mainly along the <a href="Cuyaguateje_River" title="wikilink">Cuyaguateje River</a> in <a href="Pinar_del_R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o_Province" title="wikilink">Pinar del R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o Province</a>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Five tornadoes were spawned in the area,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> one of which damaged three homes.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> In Florida, the storm brought heavy rainfall to some areas, causing localized flooding.

<h3 id="tropical-storm-barry">Tropical Storm Barry</h3>


<p>A <a href="tropical_wave" title="wikilink">tropical wave</a> emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on June 8. The system moved westward and an area of low pressure developed over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on June 16. The low then moved across Honduras,<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> where heavy rainfall triggered flooding that damaged 60 homes and affected 300 people.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Thereafter, the low re-emerged into the Caribbean Sea and developed into a tropical depression at 1200 UTC on June 17, while situated 60 mi (95 km) east of <a href="Monkey_River_Town" title="wikilink">Monkey River Town</a>. About 10 hours later, it made landfall near <a href="Big_Creek,_Belize" title="wikilink">Big Creek, Belize</a>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> In that country, an estimated  of rain fell in 24 hours, causing several rivers to over-top their banks. In some areas, <a href="culvert" title="wikilink">culverts</a> were washed away. At least 54 people living along Hope Creek were relocated to shelters.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite decreasing wind speeds as the storm crossed land, the circulation became better-defined. Early on June 19, the depression emerged into the <a href="Bay_of_Campeche" title="wikilink">Bay of Campeche</a> and began strengthening due to warm <a href="sea_surface_temperature" title="wikilink">sea surface temperatures</a>. Around 1200 UTC, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Barry. After about 12 hours, Barry attained its peak intensity with <a href="maximum_sustained_wind" title="wikilink">maximum sustained winds</a> of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a minimum <a href="barometric_pressure" title="wikilink">barometric pressure</a> of . At 1115 UTC on June 20, Barry made landfall near <a href="Veracruz,_Veracruz" title="wikilink">Veracruz, Veracruz</a> at the same intensity. The storm rapidly weakened and degenerated into a remnant low early on June 21.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> In the Mexican state of <a href="Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n</a>, wind gusts up to  and heavy rains downed trees and power lines.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> More than 26,000 residents temporarily lost power after lightning struck a nearby power station, leading to a fire.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Three deaths were reported in Mexico due to drowning.

<h3 id="tropical-storm-chantal">Tropical Storm Chantal</h3>

<p>A large-amplitude tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on July 4. The system moved rapidly westward under the influence of a <a href="subtropical_ridge" title="wikilink">subtropical ridge</a>. Based on <a href="scatterometer" class="uri" title="wikilink">scatterometer</a> passes indicating a closed circulation, Tropical Storm Chantal developed at 1200 UTC on July 7, while located about  east-southeast of <a href="Barbados" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barbados</a>. Chantal continued to move swiftly west-northwestward and was one of the fastest moving tropical cyclones in the deep tropics during the satellite era. While approaching the Lesser Antilles, it became disorganized due to wind shear. However, at 1200 UTC on July 9, Chantal peaked with sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Shortly thereafter, it crossed through the Lesser Antilles and continued weakening in the Caribbean Sea. By late on July 10, Chantal degenerated into a tropical wave while located south of <a href="Hispaniola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hispaniola</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>The storm brought heavy rainfall to the Lesser Antilles. In Dominica, several mudslides were reported. Wind gusts up to  were observed on the island, de-roofing houses and causing power outages.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Strong winds were reported on Martinique, with gusts up to  observed in <a href="Fort-de-France" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fort-de-France</a>. Trees were knocked onto roads and power lines, leaving about 33,000 people without electricity.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Elsewhere, damage reported in the Lesser Antilles was minimal, and there were no casualties.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Although sustained winds in Puerto Rico remained below tropical storm force, a weather station at Las Mareas in <a href="Guayama,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Guayama</a> observed a wind gust of  late on July 9. Winds toppled trees and power lines, blocking several roads. In Hispaniola, heavy rains caused flooding over portions of the island, but the fast-moving nature of the system precluded a more severe flooding event.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> In the Dominican Republic, there was one direct death when a firefighter from the community of Maimon was killed as he was swept away by flood waters when he tried to clear a drain.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Overall, the storm caused one death and less than $10 million in damage.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="tropical-storm-dorian">Tropical Storm Dorian</h3>

<p>Early on July 22, a tropical wave and associated low-pressure area emerged off the western coast of Africa. Based on satellite data,<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> the wave was upgraded to a tropical depression at 1800 UTC on July 23 while located about 175 mi (280 km) south of the Cape Verde Islands, and further to Tropical Storm Dorian by 0600 UTC the following day. Though the storm tracked swiftly west-northwest over warm ocean temperatures and within an environment of low wind shear initially, allowing it to attain peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) by July 25, the entrainment of drier mid-level air and cooler ocean waters caused a weakening trend to ensue.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>Late July 27, a closed low-level circulation ceased to exist and Dorian degenerated into an open trough. The remnants continued west-northwest until August 1, at which time the disturbance curved northward up reaching the western extend of a ridge. Despite continued unfavorable wind shear, a broad area of low pressure formed off the east coast of Florida and became increasingly better defined. The convection gained enough organization for the system to be re-designated as a tropical depression by 1800 UTC on August 2. However, strong northerly winds caused the depression to degenerate into a remnant low about 24 hours later, while situated southeast of <a href="Charleston,_South_Carolina" title="wikilink">Charleston, South Carolina</a>. The low was absorbed into a trough off North Carolina on August 4.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="tropical-storm-erin">Tropical Storm Erin</h3>

<p>A tropical wave accompanied by an elongated area of low pressure and a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms, emerged off the west coast of Africa on August 15. The wave moved west-northwestward due to a <a href="Ridge_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">ridge</a> to its north. The system quickly organized and its circulation became more defined, warranting its classification as a tropical depression early on August 15. Situated about 70 mi (110 km) south of <a href="Praia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Praia</a>, <a href="Cape_Verde" title="wikilink">Cape Verde</a>, tropical storm warnings were issued for the southernmost islands. Deep convection continued to develop over the center and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Erin six hours later. Shortly thereafter, dry air became entrained in the circulation and convection waned.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>Operationally, Erin was briefly downgraded to a tropical depression on August 16; however, post-storm analysis indicated that it retained tropical storm intensity that day. Early on August 17, the ship <em>British Cygnet</em> measured  winds in relation to the cyclone; around this time, it was estimated that Erin attained its peak intensity with sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1006 mbar (hPa; 29.71 inHg). A temporary northwesterly turn occurred around this time as the storm moved into a weakness in the ridge. Later on August 17, increasing wind shear took its toll on Erin and convection was displaced from the center. The following day, Erin degenerated into a remnant low about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and the west coast of Africa. The remnants proceeded westward in the low-level <a href="trade_wind" title="wikilink">trade winds</a> before opening up into a <a href="Trough_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">trough</a> early on August 20, and ultimately dissipating several days later.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="tropical-storm-fernand">Tropical Storm Fernand</h3>

<p>A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on August 10. Three days later, another tropical wave, which spawned Tropical Storm Erin, also emerged into the Atlantic. The waves moved westward and merged into a single area of disturbed weather east of the Lesser Antilles. However, further development did not occur until it crossed the Caribbean Sea and reached the Bay of Campeche on August 25. A tropical depression formed around 1200 UTC that day, while located about  north-northeast of <a href="Coatzacoalcos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Coatzacoalcos</a>, <a href="Veracruz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Veracruz</a>. Six hours later, the depression deepened into Tropical Storm Fernand. Early on August 26, Fernand peaked with sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). At 0445 UTC, the storm made landfall near <a href="Zempoala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zempoala</a>, Veracruz, at the same intensity. Fernand weakened to a tropical depression later on August 26, hours before dissipating.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>Upon the storm developing on August 25, a <a href="tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" title="wikilink">tropical storm warning</a> was posted along the Gulf Coast of Mexico from <a href="Veracruz,_Veracruz" title="wikilink">Veracruz</a> northward to <a href="Tampico,_Tamaulipas" title="wikilink">Tampico</a>, which was canceled north of <a href="Nautla,_Veracruz" title="wikilink">Barra de Nautla, Veracruz</a> early on August 26, and discontinued after Fernand weakened to a tropical depression.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Members of the <a href="Mexican_Navy" title="wikilink">Mexican Navy</a> helped evacuate 4,000 people from their homes in the state of <a href="Veracruz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Veracruz</a>.

<h3 id="tropical-storm-gabrielle">Tropical Storm Gabrielle</h3>

<p>A tropical wave accompanied with a broad area of low pressure exited the west coast of African on August 24. Upon crossing the Lesser Antilles and entering the Caribbean Sea, another tropical wave enhanced deep convection. Late on September 4, a tropical depression developed about 115 mi (185 km) south-southeast of Puerto Rico.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Operationally, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gabrielle early on September 5.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> However, in post-analysis, it was determined that Gabrielle was never a tropical storm in the Caribbean.

<p>The remnants of the depression were monitored for the potential for regeneration.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> By September 9, wind shear began decreasing and the system re-developed into a tropical depression early on September 10. Six hours later, the depression moved northward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Gabrielle. By 1200 UTC on September 10, it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . The storm passed about  east of <a href="Hamilton,_Bermuda" title="wikilink">Hamilton, Bermuda</a> early on September 11. Strong winds on the island downed trees branches caused minor infrastructural damage, and left minor power outages. Thereafter, Gabrielle encountered unfavorable wind shear and weakened to a tropical depression early on September 12. However, it briefly restrengthened to a tropical storm about 12 hours later. The storm again weakened to a tropical depression on September 13, before dissipating several hours later, while located about midway between Bermuda and <a href="Cape_Cod" title="wikilink">Cape Cod</a>, <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a>.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="tropical-depression-eight">Tropical Depression Eight</h3>

<p>A tropical wave crossed the western coast of Africa on August 23. Tracking westward, the wave reached the Caribbean Sea and became increasingly ill-defined while in the central Caribbean. However, an increase in convection was observed on September 1 and the subsequent day as the wave entered the western Caribbean. After moving into the Bay of Campeche, a broad low-pressure area formed in association with the system on September 5. An increase in deep convection on September 6 led to the formation of a tropical depression by 1200 UTC, located approximately 30 mi (50 km) east-northeast of <a href="Tampico" title="wikilink">Tampico, Mexico</a>. Thereafter, the cyclone moved west-southwest under the influence of an anticyclone.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>Around 1800 UTC on September 6, the depression made landfall near Tampico. Once inland, the depression quickly degenerated into a remnant low by 0600 UTC on September 7. It dissipated six hours later.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Heavy rains across <a href="Tamaulipas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tamaulipas</a> and <a href="Veracruz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Veracruz</a> triggered flooding in areas that were affected by Tropical Storm Fernand just two weeks prior.

<h3 id="hurricane-humberto">Hurricane Humberto</h3>

<p>A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on September 7 and spawned a low pressure area by the following day. At 1800 UTC on September 8, a tropical depression developed about 225 mi (360 km) west-southwest of <a href="Dakar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dakar</a>, <a href="Senegal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Senegal</a>. The depression moved steadily westward and intensified into Tropical Storm Humberto early on September 9. Humberto continued to strengthen while passing south of Cape Verde, due to a moist atmosphere, moderate wind shear, and warm ocean temperatures.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> The storm brought periodic squalls to Cape Verde. The southwestern islands experienced wind gusts exceeding 35 mph (55 km/h) which downed several trees. Heavy rains in many areas triggered flooding that washed out roads and damaged homes. Offshore, a freighter with a crew of six went missing amid  swells.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Later on September 10, deepening briefly halted as the storm curved northwest in response to a developing mid-level trough.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>At 1200 UTC on September 11, Humberto reached hurricane status while turning northward. About six hours later, it peaked with sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). By late on September 12, increasing wind shear, cooling sea surface temperatures, and a more stable atmosphere led to a weakening trend of the storm. Around 1200 UTC on the next day, Humberto fell to tropical storm intensity, while curving west-northwestward in the low-level flow south of the Azores surface high pressure. Early on September 14, the storm degenerated into a remnant low. However, deep convection began re-developing later that day. At 0000 UTC on September 15, Humberto regenerated into a tropical storm while located about 1,095 mi (1,760 km) southwest of <a href="Ponta_Delgada" title="wikilink">Ponta Delgada</a>, Azores. The storm decelerated late on September 16 and early on September 17 in response to a mid- to upper-level cyclone. Because the mid- to upper-level cyclone moved above Humberto's low-level circulation, the system transitioned into a subtropical storm on September 17. Humberto then weakened to a subtropical depression early the next day while situated about  south of Ponta Delgada. The subtropical depression continued north-northwestward until degenerating into an open trough and was soon absorbed by a cold front.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="hurricane-ingrid">Hurricane Ingrid</h3>


<p>A tropical wave, which exited the west coast of Africa on August 28, spawned an area of low pressure in the Bay of Campeche early on September 12. Several hours later, a tropical depression developed about 170 mi (280 km) east-southeast of Veracruz, Veracruz. Around midday on September 13, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Ingrid. After initially moving westward toward Veracruz, the storm turned northeastward away from the coast. Favorable conditions allowed it to attain hurricane status on September 14, and the next day Ingrid attained peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). Subsequently, increased wind shear weakened the convection as the storm turned more to the northwest and west. On September 16, Ingrid made landfall just south of <a href="La_Pesca" title="wikilink">La Pesca</a>, Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico as a strong tropical storm. Early on September 17, the storm weakened to a tropical depression, shortly before degenerating into an area of low pressure.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>Along with <a href="Hurricane_Manuel" title="wikilink">Hurricane Manuel</a>, Ingrid was the first storm to strike Mexico within a 24 hour period since 1958.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> The combined impacts of hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel affected two-thirds of Mexico, killing 192 people and causing $75 billion pesos (MXN, $5.7 billion USD) in damage.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Most of the effects were due to Manuel, but Ingrid was directly responsible for at least 23 deaths and $20 billion pesos (MXN, $1.5 billion USD) in damage.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a><a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> The two storms produced  of water, the equivalent of filling every dam in Mexico.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Rainfall from the storm peaked at 20.1 inches (511 mm) in Tuxpan, Veracruz.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> The rains caused widespread flooding, damaging at least 14,000 houses and hundreds of roads and bridges.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> In Tamaulipas, where the storm made landfall, the rainfall damaged crops and flooded rivers.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> The effects of the storm spread into southern Texas, causing high tides and some flooding.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> After the storm, the Mexican government declared several municipalities as states of emergency.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Relief agencies distributed food and aid to the hardest hit areas,<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a><a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> although in Tamaulipas, residents had to rely on assistance from the local <a href="Gulf_Cartel" title="wikilink">Gulf Cartel</a>.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="tropical-storm-jerry">Tropical Storm Jerry</h3>

<p>A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on September 24. Interaction with a mid- to upper-level low pressure forced the wave to split, with the southern portion spawning <a href="2013_Pacific_hurricane_season#Tropical_Storm_Octave" title="wikilink">Tropical Storm Octave</a> in the eastern Pacific Ocean on October 12. Based on scatterometer wind data, the northern portion moved north-northwestward and transitioned into a low pressure area early on September 28. After convection gradually became better organized, a tropical depression developed early on September 29, while located about  east-northeast of the Leeward Islands. The depression moved northeastward and initially struggled to intensify due to the presence of dry mid-level air.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>However, early on September 30, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Jerry while curving eastward. Shortly thereafter, vigorous deep convection developed, allowing the storm to deepen further. At 0000 UTC on October 1, Jerry attained its peak intensity with sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . However, strong wind shear soon weakened Jerry. Later on October 1, a blocking high pressure ridge caused the storm to drift northward, before curved northeastward the following day. After becoming devoid of deep convection late on October 3, Jerry became extratropical while located about  southwest of the central Azores. The remnants persisted for a few days, until being absorbed by a larger extratropical low on October 6.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="tropical-storm-karen">Tropical Storm Karen</h3>

<p>A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on September 16. Minimal tropical cyclogenesis occurred until the wave reached the western Caribbean Sea on September 27. Around then, the wave encountered an upper-level trough, increasing deep convection and spawning a broad trough of low pressure on September 28. Based on surface observations, it is estimated that Tropical Storm Karen developed near the northeastern tip of the Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Peninsula early on October 3. Despite a deteriorating cloud pattern, Karen deepened and peaked with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) later that day. Wind shear and dry air caused the storm to weaken beginning early on October 4. Throughout the day, only sporadic bursts in deep convection occurred as the storm moved northwestward at inconsistent forward speeds around a low- to mid-level ridge. Early on October 6, Karen weakened to a tropical depression. Several hours later, it degenerated into a trough offshore Louisiana.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p>Karen was one of few named storms, such as <a href="Hurricane_Alberto_(1982)" title="wikilink">Hurricane Alberto</a> in <a href="1982_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">1982</a>, during the reconnaissance era to dissipate in the Gulf of Mexico without making landfall.

<h3 id="tropical-storm-lorenzo">Tropical Storm Lorenzo</h3>

<p>A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic on October 11. Four days later, a mid- to upper-level trough increased convection along the northern portion of the wave. Thereafter, the southern portion of the wave continued westward, while the northern portion moved slowly west-northwestward and developed into a surface trough. Eventually, the system transitioned into a broad surface low. Despite southwesterly vertical shear, deep convection began to increase by late on October 20. After becoming better defined, the system developed into a tropical depression at 0600 UTC on October 21 while located about  east-southeast of Bermuda. Six hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Lorenzo.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<p>On October 21, the storm moved north-northeastward around the northwestern periphery of a mid-level ridge. Lorenzo strengthened further and peaked with sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of  at 1200 UTC on October 22. Around that time, satellite imagery indicated increased banding and an <a href="Eye_(cyclone)" title="wikilink">eye</a>-like feature. Thereafter, the cyclone turned eastward in weak westerly low- to mid-level flow. Early on October 23, strong wind shear began impacting Lorenzo, causing the circulation to become exposed of deep convection. At 0000 UTC on the following day, Lorenzo weakened to a tropical depression and degenerated into a remnant low 12 hours later. The low persisted for a few days, until it degenerated into an open trough on October 26.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> The remnants of Lorenzo fueled the <a href="St._Jude_storm" title="wikilink">St. Jude storm</a>, which struck northern Europe with hurricane-force winds from October 27&lt;U+2013&gt;October 28.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="tropical-storm-melissa">Tropical Storm Melissa</h3>

<p>Early on November 17, an extratropical low developed along a stationary front. The extratropical low northward and became co-located with an upper-level low. After the fronts dissipated, the low began producing deep convection to the near and to the west of the center. As a result, Subtropical Storm Melissa developed at 1200 UTC on November 18, while located about  east-southeast of Bermuda. Melissa moved north-northward to northward and strengthened slightly on November 19, but weakened later that day after convection diminished. Early on November 20, convection increased again, and after the storm acquired a warm core, it was reclassified as a tropical storm.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>
<p>After becoming a tropical cyclone on November 20, Melissa accelerated northeastward and slowly strengthened. Later that day, the storm attained its peak intensity with sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . However, a midst colder ocean temperatures, Melissa lost all of its deep convection and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 0000 UTC on November 22, while located about  north-northeast of <a href="Flores_Island_(Azores)" title="wikilink">Flores Island</a>, Azores. The remnants merged with another weather system several hours later.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="unnamed-subtropical-storm">Unnamed Subtropical Storm</h3>

<p>In early December, an upper-level trough stalled to the south of a ridge in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Late on December 3, an extratropical storm formed about 415 mi (260 km) south of the Azores, and with the ridge to the north it executed a cyclonic loop to the south. Amplified by an <a href="cold-core_low" title="wikilink">upper-level low</a> to the west, the storm produced a large area of gale-force winds. Early on December 4 the winds began to decrease. With low wind shear and water temperatures of 72&lt;U+00B0&gt;F (22&lt;U+00B0&gt;C), the system developed an area of convection near the center.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> At around 1800 UTC on December 4, the NHC noted in a tropical weather outlook that further development was possible before encountering unfavorable conditions.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>
<p>Early on December 5, the associated frontal features dissipated and the convection became better organized, while the center was warm-core and co-located with an upper-level low. Thus, it was estimated that the system transitioned into a subtropical storm at that time with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). The NHC operationally treated it as a non-tropical low. After becoming subtropical, the storm turned northward due to an upper-level system. The wind field gradually became smaller while the convection organized into weak rain bands. Separating from the upper-level low aloft, the storm became more tropical in nature, although it was unable to complete the transition. On December 6, the storm turned eastward due to increased upper-level flow, which also increased wind shear. The circulation became exposed from the convection, before all thunderstorms decreased. After turning back to the north, the storm weakened further due to cooler water temperatures, degenerating into a remnant low on December 7. The storm produced sustained winds of 37 mph (59 km/h) on <a href="Santa_Maria_Island" title="wikilink">Santa Maria Island</a> in the Azores, with gusts to 54 mph (87 km/h). Late on December 7, the system degenerated into a trough about 110 mi (180 km) south of the Azores.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> </p>
