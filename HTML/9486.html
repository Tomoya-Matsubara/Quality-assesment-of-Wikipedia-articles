<p>Fincher announced his candidacy for the 8th District before 11-term Democratic incumbent <a href="John_S._Tanner" title="wikilink">John S. Tanner</a> announced his retirement. He won the August primary largely as a result of high voter turnout in rural areas of the district.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In the general election, Fincher faced Democratic State Senator <a href="Roy_Herron" title="wikilink">Roy Herron</a>, Tea Party candidate Donn Janes, who earlier dropped out of the Republican primary, and Independent Mark J. Rawles. Fincher declined to participate in a series of public debates.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Fincher was criticized by Herron and local media for his decision to not disclose his income tax returns, calling the criticism a &quot;witch hunt.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Fincher stated: &quot;There is no reason for me to disclose my tax returns. These attacks are because Herron is losing and he can't handle it. He is avoiding the issues.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>He received endorsements from former Governor <a href="Winfield_Dunn" title="wikilink">Winfield Dunn</a>, <a href="Citizens_United" title="wikilink">Citizens United</a>, <a href="Eagle_Forum" title="wikilink">Eagle Forum</a>, <a href="Family_Research_Council" title="wikilink">Family Research Council</a>, <a href="Concerned_Women_for_America" title="wikilink">Concerned Women for America</a>, and State Senator <a href="Dolores_Gresham" title="wikilink">Dolores Gresham</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Fincher had over $420,000 cash on hand. Herron had over $1.1 million cash on hand.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The 8th had historically been represented by <a href="Yellow_Dog_Democrat" title="wikilink">&quot;Yellow Dog&quot; Democrats</a>. Most state and local elected officials are Democrats, and congressional elections usually saw Democrats skate to reelection. However, it has become increasingly friendly to Republicans at the national level since the turn of the 21st century. In the 2008 presidential election, Republican U.S. Senator <a href="John_McCain" title="wikilink">John McCain</a> carried the district with 56% of the vote.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>On November 2, 2010, Fincher defeated Herron, receiving 98,484 votes to Herron's 64,701. Upon his swearing-in on January 3, 2011, Fincher became the first Republican to represent what is now the 8th District since 1898.</p>

<p>Fincher was re-elected, defeating Democrat Timothy Dixon with 68% of the vote. His seat was made considerably safer with the addition of some heavily Republican suburban territory east of <a href="Memphis,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Memphis</a> which had previously been in the 7th District.</p>
<h3 id="tenure">Tenure</h3>
<p>In 2012, Fincher received the largest election contribution from the NRA; more than any US Senator or Representative.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Fincher is a fiscal and social conservative, who at the same time benefits from government farm subsidies. He is strongly pro-life and pro-gun, and opposes same-sex marriage. On the issues section of his Website, he lists his top priority as restoring &quot;limited government.&quot; He does not consider himself a traditional politician; his slogan in 2010 was &quot;My roots are in Tennessee, not in politics.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<dt>FEC investigation</dt>

</dl>
<p>On October 20, the <a href="Federal_Election_Commission" title="wikilink">Federal Election Commission</a> announced that it was conducting an investigation into a $250,000 loan the Gates Banking and Trust Company, where Fincher's father is a board member,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> made to Fincher that he did not disclose on his FEC filings.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Initially, Fincher's FEC filing indicated that the loan to the campaign committee came from the candidate&lt;U+2019&gt;s personal funds with no reference to a bank loan. On December 6, 2010, the campaign amended the filing.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> On July 21, 2011, the FEC ruled unanimously Fincher had violated federal election law by listing the loan as a personal donation rather than from Gates Banking and Trust Company. To date, no penalty has been invoked for the violation.</p>
<p>In September 2011, Fincher was named one of the &quot;Most Corrupt Members of Congress&quot; for 2011 by <a href="Citizens_for_Responsibility_and_Ethics_in_Washington" title="wikilink">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a>, specifically citing the Gates Banking loan.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
