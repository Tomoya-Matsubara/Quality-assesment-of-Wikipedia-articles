<p>The <strong>Battle of Savo Island</strong>, also known as the <strong>First Battle of Savo Island</strong> and, in Japanese sources, as the , was a <a href="naval_battle" title="wikilink">naval battle</a> of the <a href="Pacific_War" title="wikilink">Pacific Campaign</a> of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, between the <a href="Imperial_Japanese_Navy" title="wikilink">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> and <a href="Allies_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">Allied</a> naval forces. The battle took place on August 8&lt;U+2013&gt;9, <a href="1942" class="uri" title="wikilink">1942</a> and was the first major naval engagement of the <a href="Guadalcanal_campaign" title="wikilink">Guadalcanal campaign</a>.</p>
<p>In response to Allied <a href="amphibious_warfare" title="wikilink">amphibious</a> landings in the eastern <a href="Solomon_Islands" title="wikilink">Solomon Islands</a>, <a href="Vice_Admiral" title="wikilink">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Gunichi_Mikawa" title="wikilink">Gunichi Mikawa</a> brought his task force of seven cruisers and one <a href="destroyer" class="uri" title="wikilink">destroyer</a> down <a href="New_Georgia_Sound" title="wikilink">New Georgia Sound</a> (also known as &quot;the Slot&quot;) from Japanese bases at <a href="New_Britain" title="wikilink">New Britain</a> and <a href="New_Ireland" title="wikilink">New Ireland</a> to attack the Allied amphibious fleet and its screening force. The screen consisted of eight cruisers and fifteen destroyers under British <a href="Rear_Admiral" title="wikilink">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Victor_Alexander_Charles_Crutchley" title="wikilink">Victor Crutchley</a> <a href="Victoria_Cross" title="wikilink">VC</a>, but only five cruisers and seven destroyers were involved in the battle. Mikawa surprised and routed the Allied force, sinking one Australian and three American <a href="cruiser" title="wikilink">cruisers</a>, while suffering only light damage in return. Mikawa's force immediately retired following the battle without attempting to destroy the Allied transport ships supporting the landings.</p>
<p>The remaining Allied warships and the amphibious force withdrew from the Solomon Islands, temporarily conceding control of the seas around Guadalcanal to the Japanese. Allied ground forces had landed on Guadalcanal and nearby islands only two days before. The withdrawal of the fleet left them in a precarious situation, with barely enough supplies, equipment, and food to hold their <a href="beachhead" class="uri" title="wikilink">beachhead</a>. Mikawa's failure to destroy the Allied invasion transports when he had the chance, however, would prove to be a crucial strategic mistake for the Japanese as it allowed the Allies to maintain their foothold on Guadalcanal and eventually emerge victorious from the campaign.</p>

<h3 id="operations-at-guadalcanal">Operations at Guadalcanal</h3>
<p>On August 7, 1942, Allied forces (primarily <a href="United_States_Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">U.S. Marines</a>) landed on Guadalcanal, <a href="Tulagi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tulagi</a>, and <a href="Florida_Island" title="wikilink">Florida Island</a> in the eastern Solomon Islands. The landings were meant to deny their use to the Japanese as <a href="Military_base" title="wikilink">bases</a>. From the eastern Solomons, Japanese forces threatened the <a href="materiel" title="wikilink">supply</a> routes between the U.S. and Australia. The Allies also wanted to use the islands as starting points for a campaign to recapture the Solomons, isolate or capture the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rabaul</a>, and support the Allied <a href="New_Guinea_campaign" title="wikilink">New Guinea campaign</a>. The landings initiated the six-month-long <a href="Guadalcanal_campaign" title="wikilink">Guadalcanal campaign</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The overall commander of Allied naval forces in the Guadalcanal and Tulagi operation was U.S. <a href="Vice_Admiral" title="wikilink">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Frank_Jack_Fletcher" title="wikilink">Frank Jack Fletcher</a>. He also commanded the <a href="aircraft_carrier" title="wikilink">carrier</a> task groups providing air cover. U.S. <a href="Rear_Admiral" title="wikilink">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Richmond_K._Turner" title="wikilink">Richmond K. Turner</a> commanded the amphibious fleet that delivered the 16,000 Allied troops to Guadalcanal and Tulagi.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Also under Turner was British Admiral <a href="Victor_Crutchley" title="wikilink">Victor Crutchley</a>'s screening force of eight cruisers, fifteen destroyers, and five minesweepers. This force was to protect Turner's ships and provide gunfire support for the landings. Crutchley commanded his force of mostly American ships from his <a href="flagship" class="uri" title="wikilink">flagship</a>, the Australian <a href="heavy_cruiser" title="wikilink">heavy cruiser</a> <a href="HMAS_Australia_(1927)" title="wikilink">HMAS <em>Australia</em></a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The Allied landings took the Japanese by surprise. The Allies <a href="Battle_of_Tulagi_and_Gavutu-Tanambogo" title="wikilink">secured Tulagi, nearby islets Gavutu and Tanambogo</a>, and the airfield under construction on Guadalcanal by nightfall on August 8.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> On August 7 and August 8, Japanese aircraft based at Rabaul attacked the Allied amphibious forces several times, setting afire the U.S. transport ship <a href="USS_George_F._Elliott_(AP-13)" title="wikilink"><em>George F. Elliott</em></a> (which sank later) and heavily damaging the destroyer <a href="USS_Jarvis_(DD-393)" title="wikilink"><em>Jarvis</em></a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In these air attacks, the Japanese lost 36 aircraft, while the U.S. lost 19 aircraft, including 14 carrier <a href="fighter_aircraft" title="wikilink">fighter aircraft</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Concerned over the losses to his carrier fighter aircraft strength, anxious about the threat to his carriers from further Japanese air attacks, and worried about his ships' fuel levels, Fletcher announced that he would be withdrawing his carrier task forces on the evening of August 8.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Some historians contend that Fletcher's fuel situation was not at all critical but that Fletcher implied that it was to justify his withdrawal from the battle area.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Fletcher's biographer notes that Fletcher concluded that the landing was a success and that no important targets for close air support were at hand. But concerned over the loss of 21 of his carrier fighters, he assessed that his carriers were threatened by torpedo-bomber strikes and wanting to refuel before Japanese naval forces arrived, withdrew as he had previously forewarned Turner and Vandegrift. Turner, however, believed that Fletcher understood that he was to provide air cover until all the transports were unloaded on August 9.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Even though the unloading was going slower than planned, Turner decided that without carrier air cover, he would have to withdraw his ships from Guadalcanal. He planned to unload as much as possible during the night and depart the next day.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="japanese-response">Japanese response</h3>
<p>Unprepared for the Allied operation at Guadalcanal, the initial Japanese response included airstrikes and an attempted reinforcement. Mikawa, commander of the newly formed Japanese <a href="IJN_8th_Fleet" title="wikilink">Eighth Fleet</a> headquartered at Rabaul, loaded 519 naval troops on two transports and sent them towards Guadalcanal on August 7. However, when the Japanese learned that Allied forces at Guadalcanal were stronger than originally reported, the transports were recalled.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Mikawa also assembled all the available warships in the area to attack the Allied forces at Guadalcanal. At Rabaul were the heavy cruiser <a href="Japanese_cruiser_Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;kai" title="wikilink"><em>Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;kai</em></a> (Mikawa's flagship), the light cruisers <a href="Japanese_cruiser_Tenry&lt;U+016B&gt;" title="wikilink"><em>Tenry&lt;U+016B&gt;</em></a> and <a href="Japanese_cruiser_Yubari" title="wikilink"><em>Yubari</em></a> and the <a href="destroyer" class="uri" title="wikilink">destroyer</a> <a href="Japanese_destroyer_Yunagi_(1924)" title="wikilink"><em>Yunagi</em></a>. En route from <a href="Kavieng" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kavieng</a> were four heavy cruisers of Cruiser Division 6 under Rear Admiral <a href="Aritomo_Goto" title="wikilink">Aritomo Goto</a>: <a href="Japanese_cruiser_Aoba" title="wikilink"><em>Aoba</em></a>, <a href="Japanese_cruiser_Furutaka" title="wikilink"><em>Furutaka</em></a>, <a href="Japanese_cruiser_Kako" title="wikilink"><em>Kako</em></a>, and <a href="Japanese_cruiser_Kinugasa" title="wikilink"><em>Kinugasa</em></a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The Japanese Navy had trained extensively in night-fighting tactics before the war, a fact of which the Allies were unaware.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Mikawa hoped to engage the Allied naval forces off Guadalcanal and Tulagi on the night of August 8 and August 9, when he could employ his night-battle expertise while avoiding attacks from Allied aircraft, which could not operate effectively at night. Mikawa's warships rendezvoused at sea near <a href="Cape_St._George" title="wikilink">Cape St. George</a> in the evening of August 7 and then headed east-southeast.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>Mikawa decided to take his fleet north of <a href="Buka_Island" title="wikilink">Buka Island</a> and then down the east coast of <a href="Bougainville_Island" title="wikilink">Bougainville</a>. The fleet would pause east of <a href="Kieta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kieta</a> for six hours on the morning of August 8. (This would avoid daytime air attacks during their final approach to Guadalcanal.)<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Then they would proceed along the dangerous channel known as &quot;The Slot&quot;, hoping that no Allied plane would sight him in the fading light. However, the Japanese fleet was sighted in St George Channel, where their column almost ran into <a href="USS_S-38_(SS-143)" title="wikilink">USS <em>S-38</em></a>, lying in ambush. She was too close to fire torpedoes, but her captain, Lieutenant Commander H.G. Munson, radioed: &quot;TWO DESTROYERS AND THREE LARGER SHIPS OF UNKNOWN TYPE HEADING ONE FOUR ZERO TRUE AT HIGH SPEED EIGHT MILES WEST OF CAPE ST. GEORGE&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Once at Bougainville, Mikawa spread his ships out over a wide area to mask the composition of his force and launched four floatplanes from his cruisers to scout for Allied ships in the southern Solomons.</p>
<p>At 10:20 and 11:10, his ships were spotted by Australian <a href="Lockheed_Hudson" title="wikilink">Hudson</a> reconnaissance aircraft based at <a href="Milne_Bay" title="wikilink">Milne Bay</a> in New Guinea.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The first Hudson misidentified them as &quot;three cruisers, three destroyers, and two seaplane tenders&quot;. (Note: Some accounts state that the first Hudson' crew identified the enemy ships correctly but, the composition of enemy forces was changed from the aircraft crews' report by intelligence officers in Milne Bay.) The Hudson's crew tried to report the sighting to the Allied radio station at Fall River, New Guinea. Receiving no acknowledgment, they returned to Milne Bay at 12:42 to ensure that the report was received as soon as possible. The second Hudson also failed to report its sighting by radio, but completed its patrol and landed at Milne Bay at 15:00. It reported sighting &quot;two heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and one unknown type&quot;. For unknown reasons, these reports were not relayed to the Allied fleet off Guadalcanal until 18:45 and 21:30, respectively, on August 8.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Mikawa's floatplanes returned by 12:00 and reported two groups of Allied ships, one off Guadalcanal and the other off Tulagi. He reassembled his warships and began his run towards Guadalcanal, entering the Slot near <a href="Choiseul_Island" title="wikilink">Choiseul</a> by 16:00 on August 8. Mikawa communicated the following battle plan to his warships: &quot;On the rush-in we will go from S. (south) of Savo Island and torpedo the enemy main force in front of Guadalcanal anchorage; after which we will turn toward the Tulagi forward area to shell and torpedo the enemy. We will then withdraw north of Savo Island.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Mikawa's run down the Slot was not detected by Allied forces. Turner had requested that U.S. Admiral <a href="John_S._McCain,_Sr." title="wikilink">John S. McCain, Sr.</a>, commander of Allied air forces for the South Pacific area, conduct extra reconnaissance missions over the Slot in the afternoon of August 8. But, for unexplained reasons, McCain did not order the missions, nor did he tell Turner that they were not carried out. Thus, Turner mistakenly believed that the Slot was under Allied observation throughout the day.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="SavoIslandMap.jpg" title="fig:Chart of the disposition of Allied ships the night of August 8." alt="Chart of the disposition of Allied ships the night of August 8." /> To protect the unloading transports during the night, Crutchley divided the Allied warship forces into three groups. A &quot;southern&quot; group, consisting of the Australian cruisers HMAS <em>Australia</em> and <a href="HMAS_Canberra_(D33)" title="wikilink">HMAS <em>Canberra</em></a>, cruiser <a href="USS_Chicago_(CA-29)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Chicago</em></a>, and destroyers <a href="USS_Patterson_(DD-392)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Patterson</em></a> and <a href="USS_Bagley_(DD-386)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Bagley</em></a>, patrolled between Lunga Point and <a href="Savo_Island" title="wikilink">Savo Island</a> to block the entrance between Savo Island and <a href="Cape_Esperance" title="wikilink">Cape Esperance</a> on Guadalcanal. A &quot;northern&quot; group, consisting of the cruisers <a href="USS_Vincennes_(CA-44)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Vincennes</em></a>, <a href="USS_Astoria_(CA-34)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Astoria</em></a> and <a href="USS_Quincy_(CA-39)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Quincy</em></a>, and destroyers <a href="USS_Helm_(DD-388)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Helm</em></a> and <a href="USS_Wilson_(DD-408)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Wilson</em></a>, conducted a box-shaped patrol between the Tulagi anchorage and Savo Island to defend the passage between Savo and Florida Islands. An &quot;eastern&quot; group consisting of the cruisers <a href="USS_San_Juan_(CL-54)" title="wikilink">USS <em>San Juan</em></a> and <a href="HMAS_Hobart_(1939)" title="wikilink">HMAS <em>Hobart</em></a> and two U.S. destroyers guarded the eastern entrances to the sound between Florida and Guadalcanal Islands.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Crutchley placed two radar-equipped U.S. destroyers to the west of Savo Island to provide early warning for any approaching Japanese ships. The destroyer <a href="USS_Ralph_Talbot_(DD-390)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Ralph Talbot</em></a> patrolled the northern passage and the destroyer <a href="USS_Blue_(DD-387)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Blue</em></a> patrolled the southern passage, with a gap of 12&lt;U+2013&gt;30 kilometres (8&lt;U+2013&gt;20 mi) between their uncoordinated patrol patterns. At this time, the Allies were unaware of all of the limitations of their primitive ship-born <a href="radar" title="wikilink">radars</a>, such as the effectiveness of the radar could be greatly degraded by the presence of nearby landmasses.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Wary of the potential threat from Japanese submarines to the transport ships, Crutchley placed his remaining seven destroyers as close-in protection around the two transport anchorages.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The crews of the Allied ships were fatigued after two days of constant alert and action in supporting the landings. Also, the weather was extremely hot and humid, inducing further fatigue and, in <a href="Samuel_Eliot_Morison" title="wikilink">Samuel Eliot Morison</a>'s words, &quot;inviting weary sailors to slackness.&quot; In response, most of Crutchley's warships went to &quot;Condition II&quot; the night of August 8, which meant that half the crews were on duty while the other half rested, either in their bunks or near their battle stations.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In the evening, Turner called a conference on his command ship off Guadalcanal with Crutchley and Marine commander Major General <a href="Alexander_Vandegrift" title="wikilink">Alexander A. Vandegrift</a> to discuss the departure of Fletcher's carriers and the resulting withdrawal schedule for the transport ships. At 20:55, Crutchley left the southern group in <em>Australia</em> to attend the conference, leaving Captain Howard D. Bode of <em>Chicago</em> in charge of the southern group. Crutchley did not inform the commanders of the other cruiser groups of his absence, contributing further to the dissolution of command arrangements. Bode, awakened from sleep in his cabin, decided not to place his ship in the lead of the southern group of ships, the customary place for the senior ship, and went back to sleep. At the conference, Turner, Crutchley, and Vandegrift discussed the reports of the &quot;seaplane tender&quot; force reported by the Australian Hudson crew earlier that day. They decided it would not be a threat that night, because seaplane tenders did not normally engage in a surface action. Vandegrift said that he would need to inspect the transport unloading situation at Tulagi before recommending a withdrawal time for the transport ships, and he departed at midnight to conduct the inspection. Crutchley elected not to return with <em>Australia</em> to the southern force but instead stationed his ship just outside the Guadalcanal transport anchorage, without informing the other Allied ship commanders of his intentions or location.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> <img src="SavoJapaneseChart1.jpg" title="fig:Chart of the approach and departure of Mikawa&#39;s ships from the battle area" alt="Chart of the approach and departure of Mikawa&#39;s ships from the battle area" /></p>
<p>As Mikawa's force neared the Guadalcanal area, the Japanese ships launched three floatplanes for one final reconnaissance of the Allied ships, and to provide illumination by dropping flares during the upcoming battle. Although several of the Allied ships heard and/or observed one or more of these floatplanes, starting at 23:45 on August 8, none of them interpreted the presence of unknown aircraft in the area as an actionable threat, and no one reported the sightings to Crutchley or Turner.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Mikawa's force approached in a single 3 kilometre (2 mi) column led by <em>Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;kai</em>, with <em>Aoba</em>, <em>Kako</em>, <em>Kinugasa</em>, <em>Furutaka</em>, <em>Tenry&lt;U+016B&gt;</em>, <em>Yubari</em>, and <em>Yunagi</em> following. Sometime between 00:44 and 00:54 on August 9, lookouts in Mikawa's ships spotted <em>Blue</em> about 9 kilometres (5.5 mi) ahead of the Japanese column.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="action-south-of-savo">Action south of Savo</h3>
<p>To avoid <em>Blue</em>, Mikawa changed course to pass north of Savo Island.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He also ordered his ships to slow to , to reduce wakes that might make his ships more visible.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Four minutes later, Mikawa's lookouts spied either <em>Ralph Talbot</em> about 16 kilometres (10 mi) away or a small <a href="schooner" class="uri" title="wikilink">schooner</a> of unknown nationality.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The Japanese ships held their course while pointing more than 50 guns at <em>Blue</em>, ready to open fire at the first indication that <em>Blue</em> had sighted them.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> When <em>Blue</em> was less than 2 kilometres (1 mi) away from Mikawa's force, she suddenly reversed course, having reached the end of her patrol track, and steamed away, apparently oblivious to the long column of large Japanese ships sailing by her.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Seeing that his ships were still undetected, Mikawa turned back to a course south of Savo Island and increased speed, first to , and then to . At 01:25, Mikawa released his ships to operate independently of his flagship, and at 01:31, he ordered, &quot;Every ship attack.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>At about this time, <em>Yunagi</em> detached from the Japanese column and reversed direction, perhaps because she lost sight of the other Japanese ships ahead of her, or perhaps she was ordered to provide a &quot;rear guard&quot; for Mikawa's force. One minute later, Japanese lookouts sighted a warship to <a href="port_(nautical)" title="wikilink">port</a>. This ship was the destroyer <em>Jarvis</em>, heavily damaged the day before and now departing Guadalcanal independently for repairs in Australia. Whether <em>Jarvis</em> sighted the Japanese ships is unknown, since her radios had been destroyed. <em>Furutaka</em> launched torpedoes at <em>Jarvis</em>, which all missed.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The Japanese ships passed as close to 1,100 metres of <em>Jarvis</em>, close enough for officers on <em>Tenry&lt;U+016B&gt;</em> to look down onto the destroyer's decks without seeing any of her crew moving about. If <em>Jarvis</em> was aware of the Japanese ships passing by, she did not respond in any noticeable way.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Two minutes after sighting <em>Jarvis</em>, the Japanese lookouts sighted the Allied destroyers and cruisers of the southern force about 12,500 metres away, silhouetted by the glow from the burning <em>George F. Elliot</em>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Several minutes later, at about 01:38, the Japanese cruisers began launching salvos of torpedoes at the Allied southern force ships.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> At this same time, lookouts on <em>Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;kai</em> spotted the ships of the Allied northern force at a range of 16 kilometres (10 mi).<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> <em>Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;kai</em> turned to face this new threat, and the rest of the Japanese column followed, while still preparing to engage the Allied southern force ships with gunfire.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Patterson</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s crew was alert because the destroyer's captain had taken seriously the earlier daytime sightings of Japanese warships and evening sightings of unknown aircraft, and told his crew to be ready for action. At 01:43, <em>Patterson</em> spotted a ship, probably <em>Kinugasa</em>, 5,000 meters dead ahead and immediately sent a warning by radio and signal lamp: &quot;Warning! Warning! Strange ships entering the harbor!&quot; <em>Patterson</em> increased speed to full, and fired star shells towards the Japanese column. Her captain ordered a torpedo attack, but his order was not heard over the noise from the destroyer's guns.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>At about the same moment that <em>Patterson</em> sighted the Japanese ships and went into action, the Japanese floatplanes overhead, on orders from Mikawa, dropped aerial flares directly over <em>Canberra</em> and <em>Chicago</em>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> <em>Canberra</em> responded immediately, with Captain <a href="Frank_Getting" title="wikilink">Frank Getting</a> ordering an increase in speed, a reversal of an initial turn to port, which kept <em>Canberra</em> between the Japanese and the Allied transports, and for her guns to train out and fire at any targets that could be sighted.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Less than one minute later, as <em>Canberra</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s guns took aim at the Japanese, <em>Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;kai</em> and <em>Furutaka</em> opened fire on her, scoring numerous hits within a few seconds. <em>Aoba</em> and <em>Kako</em> joined in with gunfire, and within the next three minutes <em>Canberra</em> took up to 24 large caliber hits. Early hits killed her gunnery officer, mortally wounded Getting, and destroyed both boiler rooms, knocking out power to the entire ship before <em>Canberra</em> could fire any of her guns or communicate a warning to other Allied ships. The cruiser glided to a stop, on fire, with a 5- to 10-degree list to starboard, and unable to fight the fires or pump out flooded compartments because of lack of power. Since all of the Japanese ships were on the port side of <em>Canberra</em>, the damage to the ship's starboard side occurred either from shells entering low on the port side and exiting below the waterline on the starboard side, or from one or two torpedo hits on the starboard side.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> If torpedoes did hit <em>Canberra</em> on the starboard side, then they may have come from a nearby Allied ship, and at this time the U.S. destroyer <em>Bagley</em> was the only ship on that side of the Australian cruiser and had fired torpedoes moments earlier.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

Bode ordered his five-inch (127 mm) guns to fire star shells towards the Japanese column, but the shells did not function.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> At 01:47, a torpedo, probably from <em>Kako</em>, hit <em>Chicago</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s bow, sending a shock wave throughout the ship that damaged the main battery director. A second torpedo hit but failed to explode, and a shell hit the cruiser's mainmast, killing two crewmen. <em>Chicago</em> steamed west for 40 minutes,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> leaving behind the transports she was assigned to protect. The cruiser fired her secondary batteries at the trailing ships in the Japanese column and may have hit <em>Tenry&lt;U+016B&gt;</em>, causing slight damage. Bode did not try to assert control over any of the other Allied ships in the southern force, of which he was still technically in command. More significantly, Bode made no attempt to warn any of the other Allied ships or personnel in the Guadalcanal area as his ship headed away from the battle area.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>During this time, <em>Patterson</em> engaged in a gun duel with the Japanese column. <em>Patterson</em> received a shell hit aft, causing moderate damage and killing 10 crew members. <em>Patterson</em> continued to pursue and fire at the Japanese ships and may have hit <em>Kinugasa</em>, causing moderate damage.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> <em>Patterson</em> then lost sight of the Japanese column as it headed northeast along the eastern shore of Savo Island.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> <em>Bagley</em>, whose crew sighted the Japanese shortly after <em>Patterson</em> and <em>Canberra</em>, circled completely around to port before firing torpedoes in the general direction of the rapidly disappearing Japanese column; one or two of which may have hit <em>Canberra</em>. <em>Bagley</em> played no further role in the battle.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> <em>Yunagi</em> exchanged non-damaging gunfire with <em>Jarvis</em> before exiting the battle area to the west with the intention of eventually rejoining the Japanese column north and west of Savo Island.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>At 01:44, as Mikawa's ships headed towards the Allied northern force, <em>Tenry&lt;U+016B&gt;</em> and <em>Yubari</em> split from the rest of the Japanese column and took a more westward course. <em>Furutaka</em>, either because of a steering problem,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> or to avoid a possible collision with <em>Canberra</em>, followed <em>Yubari</em> and <em>Tenry&lt;U+016B&gt;</em>. Thus, the Allied northern force was about to be enveloped and attacked from two sides.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="action-north-of-savo">Action north of Savo</h3>
<p><img src="SavoIslandMap2A.jpg" title="fig:Map of the action northeast of Savo." alt="Map of the action northeast of Savo." />When Mikawa's ships attacked the Allied southern force, the captains of all three U.S. northern force cruisers were asleep, with their ships steaming quietly at .<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Although crewmen on all three ships observed flares or gunfire from the battle south of Savo or else received <em>Patterson</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s warning of threatening ships entering the area, it took some time for the crews to go from Condition II to full alert.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> At 01:44, the Japanese cruisers began firing torpedoes at the northern force. At 01:50, they aimed powerful searchlights at the three northern cruisers and opened fire with their guns.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Astoria</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s bridge crew called <a href="general_quarters" title="wikilink">general quarters</a> upon sighting the flares south of Savo, around 01:49. At 01:52, shortly after the Japanese searchlights came on and shells began falling around the ship, <em>Astoria</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s main gun director crews spotted the Japanese cruisers and opened fire. <em>Astoria</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s captain, awakened to find his ship in action, rushed to the bridge and ordered a cease fire, fearful that his ship might be firing on friendly forces. As shells continued to cascade around his ship, the captain ordered firing resumed less than a minute later. <em>Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;kai</em>, however, had found the range, and <em>Astoria</em> was quickly hit by numerous shells and set afire.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Between 02:00 and 02:15, <em>Aoba</em>, <em>Kinugasa</em>, and <em>Kako</em> joined <em>Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;kai</em> in pounding <em>Astoria</em>, destroying the cruiser's engine room and bringing the flaming ship to a halt. At 02:16, one of <em>Astoria</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s remaining operational main gun turrets fired at <em>Kinugasa</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s searchlight, but missed and hit <em>Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;kai</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s forward turret, putting the turret out of action and causing moderate damage to the ship.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Quincy</em> had also seen the aircraft flares over the southern ships, received <em>Patterson</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s warning, and had just sounded general quarters and was coming alert when the searchlights from the Japanese column came on. <em>Quincy</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s captain gave the order to commence firing, but the gun crews were not ready. Within a few minutes, <em>Quincy</em> was caught in a crossfire between <em>Aoba</em>, <em>Furutaka</em>, and <em>Tenry&lt;U+016B&gt;</em>, and was hit heavily and set afire. <em>Quincy</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s captain ordered his cruiser to charge towards the eastern Japanese column, but as she turned to do so <em>Quincy</em> was hit by two torpedoes from <em>Tenry&lt;U+016B&gt;</em>, causing severe damage. <em>Quincy</em> managed to fire a few main gun salvos, one of which hit <em>Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;kai</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s chart room 6 meters (20 ft) from Admiral Mikawa and killed or wounded 36 men, although Mikawa was not injured. At 02:10, incoming shells killed or wounded almost all of <em>Quincy</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s bridge crew, including the captain. At 02:16, the cruiser was hit by a torpedo from <em>Aoba</em>, and the ship's remaining guns were silenced. <em>Quincy</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s assistant gunnery officer, sent to the bridge to ask for instructions, reported on what he found: <em>Quincy</em> sank, bow first, at 02:38.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="SavoIslandYubariSearchlight.jpg" title="fig:Japanese cruiser Yubari shines searchlights towards the northern force of Allied warships during the battle." alt="Japanese cruiser Yubari shines searchlights towards the northern force of Allied warships during the battle." /> Like <em>Quincy</em> and <em>Astoria</em>, <em>Vincennes</em> also sighted the aerial flares to the south, and furthermore, actually sighted gunfire from the southern engagement. At 01:50, when the U.S. cruisers were illuminated by the Japanese searchlights, <em>Vincennes</em> hesitated to open fire, believing that the searchlight's source might be friendly ships. Shortly thereafter, <em>Kako</em> opened fire on <em>Vincennes</em> which responded with her own gunfire at 01:53.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> As <em>Vincennes</em> began to receive damaging shell hits, her commander, U.S. <a href="Frederick_Lois_Riefkohl" title="wikilink">Captain Frederick L. Riefkohl</a>, ordered an increase of speed to , but shortly thereafter, at 01:55, two torpedoes from <em>Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;kai</em> hit, causing heavy damage. <em>Kinugasa</em> now joined <em>Kako</em> in pounding <em>Vincennes</em>. <em>Vincennes</em> scored one hit on <em>Kinugasa</em> causing moderate damage to her steering engines. The rest of the Japanese ships also fired and hit <em>Vincennes</em> up to 74 times, and, at 02:03, another torpedo hit her, this time from <em>Yubari</em>. With all boiler rooms destroyed, <em>Vincennes</em> came to a halt, burning &quot;everywhere&quot; and listing to port. At 02:16, Riefkohl ordered the crew to abandon ship, and <em>Vincennes</em> sank at 02:50.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>During the engagement, the U.S. destroyers <em>Helm</em> and <em>Wilson</em> struggled to see the Japanese ships. Both destroyers briefly fired at Mikawa's cruisers but caused no damage and received no damage to themselves.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>At 02:16, the Japanese columns ceased fire on the northern Allied force as they moved out of range around the north side of Savo Island. <em>Ralph Talbot</em> encountered <em>Furutaka</em>, <em>Tenry&lt;U+016B&gt;</em>, and <em>Yubari</em> as they cleared Savo Island. The Japanese ships fixed the U.S. destroyer with searchlights and hit her several times with gunfire, causing heavy damage, but <em>Ralph Talbot</em> escaped into a nearby rain squall, and the Japanese ships left her behind.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="mikawas-decision">Mikawa's decision</h3>
<p>At 02:16 Mikawa conferred with his staff about whether they should turn to continue the battle with the surviving Allied warships and try to sink the Allied transports in the two anchorages. Several factors influenced his ultimate decision. His ships were scattered and would take some time to regroup.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> His ships would need to reload their torpedo tubes, a labor-intensive task that would take some time. Mikawa also did not know the number and locations of any remaining Allied warships and his ships had expended much of their ammunition.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>More importantly, Mikawa had no air cover and believed that U.S. aircraft carriers were in the area. Mikawa was probably aware that the Japanese Navy had no more heavy cruisers in production, and thus would be unable to replace any that he believed he might lose to air attack the next day if he remained near Guadalcanal.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> He was unaware that the U.S. carriers had withdrawn from the battle area and would not be a threat the next day. Although several of Mikawa's staff urged an attack on the Allied transports, the consensus was to withdraw from the battle area.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Therefore, at 02:20, Mikawa ordered his ships to retire.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>

</figure>
<p>At 04:00 on August 9 <em>Patterson</em> came alongside <em>Canberra</em> to assist the cruiser in fighting her fires. By 05:00, it appeared that the fires were almost under control, but Turner, who at this time intended to withdraw all Allied ships by 06:30, ordered the ship to be scuttled if it was not able to accompany the fleet. After the survivors were removed, the destroyers <a href="USS_Selfridge_(DD-357)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Selfridge</em></a> and <a href="USS_Ellet_(DD-398)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Ellet</em></a> sank <em>Canberra</em> with torpedoes and gunfire.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>Later in the morning of August 9 General Vandegrift advised Admiral Turner that he needed more supplies unloaded from the transports before they withdrew. Therefore, Turner postponed the withdrawal of his ships until mid-afternoon. In the meantime, <em>Astoria</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s crew tried to save their sinking ship. <em>Astoria</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s fires, however, eventually became completely out of control, and the ship sank at 12:15.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>On the morning of August 9, an Australian <a href="Coastwatchers" title="wikilink">coastwatcher</a> on Bougainville radioed a warning of a Japanese airstrike on the way from Rabaul. The Allied transport crews ceased unloading for a time but were puzzled when the airstrike did not materialize. Allied forces did not discover until after the war was over that this Japanese airstrike instead concentrated on <em>Jarvis</em> south of Guadalcanal, sinking her with all hands. The Allied transports and warships all departed the Guadalcanal area by nightfall on August 9.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>In the late evening of August 9, Mikawa on <em>Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;kai</em> released the four cruisers of Cruiser Division 6 to return to their home base at Kavieng. At 08:10 on August 10, <em>Kako</em> was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine <a href="USS_S-44_(SS-155)" title="wikilink">USS <em>S 44</em></a> 110 kilometers (70 mi) from its destination. The other three Japanese cruisers picked up all but 71 of her crew and went on to Kavieng.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>From the time of the battle until several months later, almost all Allied supplies and reinforcements sent to Guadalcanal came by transports in small convoys, mainly during daylight hours, while Allied aircraft from the New Hebrides and <a href="Honiara_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Henderson Field</a> and any available aircraft carriers flew covering missions. During this time, Allied forces on Guadalcanal received barely enough ammunition and provisions to withstand the several Japanese drives to retake the islands.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite their defeat in this battle, the Allies eventually won the battle for Guadalcanal, an important step in the eventual defeat of Japan. In hindsight, if Mikawa had elected to risk his ships to go after the Allied transports on the morning of August 9, he could have ended the Guadalcanal campaign at its inception, and the course of the war in the southern Pacific could have gone much differently. Although the Allied warships at Guadalcanal that night were completely routed, they did accomplish their mission, which was to protect the vital transports from harm. Many of these same transports were used many times to bring crucial supplies and reinforcements to Allied forces on Guadalcanal over succeeding months. Mikawa's decision not to destroy the Allied transport ships when he had the opportunity would prove to be a crucial strategic mistake for the Japanese.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> <img src="SavoJapaneseWarArt.jpg" title="fig:Japanese artwork from during the war depicts the destruction of three U.S. cruisers by Japanese warships at Savo Island" alt="Japanese artwork from during the war depicts the destruction of three U.S. cruisers by Japanese warships at Savo Island" /></p>
<p>A formal <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">United States Navy</a> board of inquiry, known as the Hepburn Investigation, subsequently prepared a report of the battle. The board interviewed most of the major Allied officers involved over several months, beginning in December 1942.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> The report recommended official censure for only one officer: Captain Howard D. Bode. The report stopped short of recommending formal action against other Allied officers, including Admirals Fletcher, Turner, McCain, and Crutchley, and Captain Riefkohl. The careers of Turner, Crutchley, and McCain do not appear to have been affected by the defeat or the mistakes they made in contributing to it. Riefkohl, however, never commanded ships again. Captain Bode, upon learning that the report was going to be especially critical of his actions, shot himself in his quarters at <a href="Balboa,_Panama" title="wikilink">Balboa</a>, <a href="Panama_Canal_Zone" title="wikilink">Panama Canal Zone</a>, on April 19, 1943, and died the next day.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Crutchley was gazetted with the <a href="Legion_of_Merit" title="wikilink">Legion of Merit</a> (Chief Commander) in September 1944. <a href="Admiral_Yamamoto" title="wikilink">Admiral Yamamoto</a> signaled a congratulatory note to Mikawa on his victory, stating, &quot;Appreciate the courageous and hard fighting of every man of your organisation. I expect you to expand your exploits and you will make every effort to support the land forces of the Imperial army which are now engaged in a desperate struggle.&quot; Later on, though, when it became apparent that Mikawa had missed an opportunity to destroy the Allied transports, he was intensely criticised by his comrades.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Admiral Turner later assessed why his forces were so soundly defeated in the battle: </p>
<p>Historian <a href="Richard_B._Frank" title="wikilink">Richard B. Frank</a> adds that, &quot;This lethargy of mind would not be completely shaken off without some more hard blows to (U.S.) Navy pride around Guadalcanal, but after Savo, the United States picked itself up off the deck and prepared for the most savage combat in its history.&quot;<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>Daniel H. Galvin Jr., a survivor of the sinking of the USS Quincy writes that: &lt;U+201C&gt;For nearly 40 years the sailors [of the Quincy] held their grief for the loss of 389 shipmates &lt;U+2013&gt; and an underserved shame for this overwhelming loss.&lt;U+201D&gt; However, because of the Freedom of Information Act, historians were able to discover the truth concerning the &lt;U+201C&gt;The Battle of Savo Island.&lt;U+201D&gt; Galvin writes that what precipitated the defeat was Fletcher leaving the area and not assigning anyone to be in charge. In addition Australian allies who knew of the approaching Japanese warships failed to inform the Americans.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

The misidentification of two of Mikawa's cruisers as seaplane tenders by the first Hudson may have been because of the wide dispersal of the Japanese warships; also, the Hudson's crew sighted a floatplane returning. The first Hudson's report was not received by radio because the Fall River station was shut down at that time for an air raid alert. When the second Hudson tried to radio its sighting of Mikawa's force, Fall River refused to receive the report and rebuked the Hudson's crew for breaking radio silence. Loxton calls the claims by Morison, Dull, Richard Newcomb, and other historians that the first Hudson crew made no attempt to radio their sighting report, routinely and leisurely completed their patrol, and then &quot;had tea&quot; before submitting their report at Milne Bay an &quot;outrageous rumor&quot; and &quot;calumny&quot; that is at odds with what he found in his research.<a href="#fnref18" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
