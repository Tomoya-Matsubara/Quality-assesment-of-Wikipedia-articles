It was commissioned by the BBC to mark the deaths of <a href="Henry_Allingham" title="wikilink">Henry Allingham</a> and <a href="Harry_Patch" title="wikilink">Harry Patch</a>, two of the last three surviving British veterans from the <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">First World War</a>, and was first broadcast on the <a href="BBC_Radio_4" title="wikilink">BBC Radio 4</a> programme <em><a href="Today_programme" title="wikilink">Today</a></em> on 30 July 2009, the date of Allingham's funeral.</p>
<p>The poem, named after the <a href="Last_Post" title="wikilink">Last Post</a> (the bugle call used at British ceremonies remembering those killed in war), makes explicit references to <a href="Wilfred_Owen" title="wikilink">Wilfred Owen</a>'s poem from the First World War <em><a href="Dulce_et_Decorum_Est" title="wikilink">Dulce et Decorum Est</a></em>. It imagines what would happen if time ran backwards and those killed in the war came back to life; their lives would still be full of possibilities and filled with &quot;love, work, children, talent, English beer, good food.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The poem was generally well received, with one commentator saying that it was &quot;simply a damn good poem with rich imagery, cinematic movement and poignant ending.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Another said that it was &quot;moving reversal of history&quot; and a &quot;fine poem&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Duffy herself was quoted as saying that she wanted to honour the tradition of poets who were soldiers.</p>

<p>Duffy said that she felt that she should &quot;honour that great tradition of poets who were also soldiers&quot;, describing the poem as &quot;an attempt at healing and being at one with the world&quot;, and &quot;a tribute and blessing, even an apology, on behalf of poetry and all poets.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> She added that she &quot;had been thinking about Afghanistan and trying to enthuse new war poetry among contemporary poets.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The poem was broadcast one week after Duffy published a selection of poems she had commissioned from poets such as <a href="Sean_O&#39;Brien_(writer)" title="wikilink">Sean O'Brien</a>, <a href="Paul_Muldoon" title="wikilink">Paul Muldoon</a> and <a href="Daljit_Nagra" title="wikilink">Daljit Nagra</a> about the ongoing <a href="War_in_Afghanistan_(2001&lt;U+2013&gt;present)" title="wikilink">war in Afghanistan</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="poem">Poem</h2>
<p><img src="Wilfred-Owen.jpg" title="fig:Wilfred Owen" alt="Wilfred Owen" /> The poem takes its title from the bugle call used at British ceremonies remembering those killed in war, the <a href="Last_Post" title="wikilink">Last Post</a>. It begins with two lines from the poem <em><a href="Dulce_et_Decorum_Est" title="wikilink">Dulce et Decorum Est</a></em> by the First World War poet <a href="Wilfred_Owen" title="wikilink">Wilfred Owen</a>:<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> <poem> <em>In all my dreams, before my helpless sight</em> <em>He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning</em>. </poem> The title of Owen's poem is part of a line from the Roman poet <a href="Horace" class="uri" title="wikilink">Horace</a> – <em></em> (&quot;It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country&quot;). The phrase was inscribed over the chapel door at <a href="Royal_Military_Academy_Sandhurst" title="wikilink">Sandhurst</a>, the British military academy, in 1913.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The phrase is again referenced when Duffy writes &quot;Dulce &lt;U+2014&gt; No &lt;U+2014&gt; Decorum &lt;U+2014&gt; No &lt;U+2014&gt; Pro patria mori.&quot; The writer Will Heaven said that, whilst the poem denies that death in war is &quot;sweet and proper&quot; (<em>dulce et decorum</em>), it does not deny that the soldiers died for their country (<em>pro patria mori</em>).<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The heart of the poem depicts events &quot;if poetry could tell it backwards&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; soldiers who died in the war coming back to life, &quot;lines and lines of British boys rewind / back to their trenches&quot;. The poem imagines &quot;all those thousands dead / are shaking dried mud from their hair / and queuing up for home&quot;. Duffy pictures what would have happened to them if they had not died: <poem> <em>You lean against a wall,</em> <em>your several million lives still possible</em> <em>and crammed with love, work, children, talent, English beer, good food.</em> </poem> before adding, &quot;You see the poet tuck away his pocket-book and smile&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> <a href="Erica_Wagner" title="wikilink">Erica Wagner</a>, the literary editor of <em><a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">The Times</a></em>, said that the poet Duffy refers to in the poem could be Owen, but could also be <a href="John_McCrae" title="wikilink">John McCrae</a>, <a href="Isaac_Rosenberg" title="wikilink">Isaac Rosenberg</a>, or <a href="Charles_Hamilton_Sorley" title="wikilink">Charles Hamilton Sorley</a>, or one of a number of other poets from the war. Wagner also noted that &quot;Harry Patch and Henry Allingham escaped death, but never the effect of that awful war.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reaction">Reaction</h2>
<p>The poem received a generally favourable critical reaction. Wagner called it a &quot;moving reversal of history&quot;, a &quot;fine poem&quot;, and &quot;the latest in a noble line of work [about the First World War] that aspires to a kind of salvation.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Heaven said that it was a &quot;poignant and beautiful tribute&quot; to Allingham.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> It has been called &quot;sombre yet supremely uplifting&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The poem was also noticed in the United States. Jenna Krajeski, a writer for <em><a href="The_New_Yorker" title="wikilink">The New Yorker</a></em>, described it as &quot;another strong at-bat&quot;, and said that the poem highlighted &quot;the power, but also the shortcomings, of poetry&quot; when writing about an &quot;imaginary, impossible event&quot; and also writing about writing about it.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The American poet John Lundberg said that the poem was a &quot;surprising success&quot;, adding that not only was it &quot;accessible&quot; and &quot;a fitting tribute to those who served in World War I,&quot; but also &quot;simply a damn good poem with rich imagery, cinematic movement and poignant ending.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> However, Christopher Howse, a writer for the <em><a href="Daily_Telegraph" title="wikilink">Daily Telegraph</a></em>, took a different view of the poem's merits, saying (under the title &quot;Carol Ann Duffy falls short of Henry Allingham&quot;) that Duffy's verse form was &quot;open, to the point of invisibility&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
