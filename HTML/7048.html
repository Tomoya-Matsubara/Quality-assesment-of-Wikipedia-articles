<h3 id="expenses-scandal">Expenses scandal</h3>

<p>According to one newspaper report, Fallon, Deputy Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, claimed for mortgage repayments on his Westminster flat in their entirety. MPs are only allowed to claim for interest charges.</p>
<p>Between 2002 and 2004, Fallon regularly claimed &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,255 per month in capital repayments and interest, rather than the &lt;U+00A3&gt;700-&lt;U+00A3&gt;800 for the interest-component alone. After his error was noticed by staff at the Commons Fees Office in September 2004, he asked: &quot;Why has no one brought this to my attention before?&quot; He repaid &lt;U+00A3&gt;2,200 of this over-claim, but was allowed to offset the remaining &lt;U+00A3&gt;6,100 against his allowance. After realising they had failed to notice the excessive claims, Commons staff suggested Fallon submit fresh claims which would &quot;reassign&quot; the surplus payments to other costs he had legitimately incurred.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
