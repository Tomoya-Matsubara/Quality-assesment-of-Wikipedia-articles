<p>A brave and skilful observer who has taken part in many combats with enemy aircraft, invariably displaying cool courage and presence of mind. On a recent occasion our patrol of eleven machines, after bombing a railway junction, was attacked by fifteen enemy scouts. One of these, which was engaged by this officer's pilot, crumpled and fell. The formation was then attacked by seven Fokkers from above, one of which was shot down by 2nd Lt. Ralph.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
