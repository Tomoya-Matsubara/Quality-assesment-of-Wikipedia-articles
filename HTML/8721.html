<p><strong>Emery Molyneux</strong> (, <em><a href="Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key" title="wikilink">EM-(&lt;U+0259&gt;-)ree MO-l&lt;U+0259&gt;-noe</a></em>) (died June 1598) was an <a href="Elizabethan_era" title="wikilink">Elizabethan</a> maker of <a href="globe" title="wikilink">globes</a>, mathematical instruments and <a href="Weapon" title="wikilink">ordnance</a>. His terrestrial and celestial globes, first published in 1592, were the first to be made in <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a> and the first to be made by an Englishman.</p>
<p>Known as a <a href="mathematician" class="uri" title="wikilink">mathematician</a> and maker of mathematical instruments such as <a href="compass" title="wikilink">compasses</a> and <a href="hourglass" title="wikilink">hourglasses</a>, Molyneux became acquainted with many prominent men of his age, including the explorers <a href="Thomas_Cavendish" title="wikilink">Thomas Cavendish</a>, <a href="John_Davis_(English_explorer)" title="wikilink">John Davis</a>, <a href="Francis_Drake" title="wikilink">Francis Drake</a> and <a href="Walter_Raleigh" title="wikilink">Walter Raleigh</a>, the writer <a href="Richard_Hakluyt" title="wikilink">Richard Hakluyt</a>, and the mathematicians Robert Hues and Edward Wright. Davis probably introduced Molyneux to his own patron, the London merchant William Sanderson, who largely financed the construction of the globes. When completed, the globes were presented to <a href="Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Elizabeth I</a>. Larger globes were acquired by royalty, noblemen and academic institutions, while smaller ones were purchased as practical navigation aids for sailors and students. The globes were the first to be made in such a way that they were unaffected by the humidity at sea, and they came into general use on ships.</p>
<p>Molyneux emigrated to <a href="Amsterdam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amsterdam</a> with his wife in 1596–1597. He succeeded in interesting the <a href="States-General_of_the_Netherlands" title="wikilink">States-General</a>, the parliament of the <a href="Dutch_Republic" title="wikilink">United Provinces</a>, in a cannon he had invented but died suddenly in June 1598, apparently in poverty. The globe-making industry in England died with him.</p>
<p>Only six Molyneux globes are believed to be still in existence. Three are in England, of which one pair, consisting of a terrestrial and a celestial globe, is owned by <a href="Middle_Temple" title="wikilink">Middle Temple</a> and displayed in its library, while a terrestrial globe is at <a href="Petworth_House" title="wikilink">Petworth House</a> in <a href="Petworth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Petworth</a>, <a href="West_Sussex" title="wikilink">West Sussex</a>.</p>

<p>Through his trade, Molyneux was known to the explorers <a href="Thomas_Cavendish" title="wikilink">Thomas Cavendish</a>, <a href="John_Davis_(English_explorer)" title="wikilink">John Davis</a>, <a href="Francis_Drake" title="wikilink">Francis Drake</a> and <a href="Walter_Raleigh" title="wikilink">Walter Raleigh</a>, the writer <a href="Richard_Hakluyt" title="wikilink">Richard Hakluyt</a>, and the mathematicians Robert Hues and Edward Wright.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The construction of globes by Molyneux appears to have been suggested by Davis to his <a href="Patronage" title="wikilink">patron</a> William Sanderson, a London merchant who has been described as &quot;one of the most munificent and patriotic of merchant-princes of London in the days of Elizabeth I&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Sanderson readily agreed to bear the manufacturing costs,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and financed initial production of the globes with a capital investment of &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,000<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> (almost &lt;U+00A3&gt;160,000 as at 2007).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>In making his terrestrial globes, Molyneux examined ruttiers (instructions for directions at sea)<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and pilots (navigational handbooks).<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> such as the ruttier for Brazil and the West Indies he gave to <a href="Thomas_Harriot" title="wikilink">Thomas Harriot</a> in 1590.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> He also received advice and assistance from navigators and mathematicians.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> It is likely, for instance, that he obtained information for a legend in <a href="Spanish_language" title="wikilink">Spanish</a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> on the terrestrial globe about the <a href="Solomon_Islands" title="wikilink">Solomon Islands</a> from Sir Walter Raleigh, who was informed of it by <a href="Pedro_Sarmiento_de_Gamboa" title="wikilink">Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa</a>.

<p>On the terrestrial globe, tracks of the voyages of Francis Drake and Thomas Cavendish around the world are marked by red and blue lines respectively. These lines were applied when the globe was first made, for they are referred to in a description of Molyneux's globes in <em>Blundeville His Exercises</em> (1594)<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> by Thomas Blundeville, a country gentleman who was an enthusiastic student of astronomy and navigation.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Thomas Cavendish also appears to have helped Molyneux with his globes, or it is possible that Molyneux accompanied him on his 1587 voyage around the world, which returned to England on <a href="9_September" title="wikilink">9 September</a> <a href="1588" class="uri" title="wikilink">1588</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In 1889, Sir <a href="Clements_Markham" title="wikilink">Clements Markham</a>, an English explorer, author and geographer, pointed out that a <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> legend on the terrestrial globe placed off the <a href="Patagonia" title="wikilink">Patagonian</a> coast states: &quot;Thomas Caundish <em>18 Dec. 1587 h&lt;U+00E6&gt;c terra</em> sub nostris oculis <em>primum obtulit sub latitud 47 cujus seu admodum salubris Incol&lt;U+00E6&gt; maturi ex parte proceri sunt gigantes et vasti magnitudinis</em>&quot;.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> However, <a href="Helen_Wallis" title="wikilink">Helen Wallis</a>, former Map Curator of the <a href="British_Library" title="wikilink">British Library</a>, wrote in 1951 that this was unlikely as Molyneux had incorrectly plotted the course of Cavendish's journey in the <a href="Malay_Archipelago" title="wikilink">East Indian Archipelago</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Nonetheless she suggests that, judging from another legend on the globe, he appears to have sailed on at least one if not all of John Davis's voyages.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Mathematician and <a href="Cartography" title="wikilink">cartographer</a> Edward Wright<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> assisted Molyneux in plotting coastlines on the terrestrial globe and translated some of the legends into Latin, and on <a href="10_April" title="wikilink">10 April</a> <a href="1591" class="uri" title="wikilink">1591</a> the <a href="astrologer" class="uri" title="wikilink">astrologer</a> and physician <a href="Simon_Forman" title="wikilink">Simon Forman</a> visited his workshop and taught him how to find <a href="longitude" class="uri" title="wikilink">longitude</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> It appears that after Molyneux had prepared the manuscript <a href="Gore_(segment)" title="wikilink">gores</a> (that is, the flat map segments that would later be attached to the globes) he had them printed by the celebrated <a href="Flanders" title="wikilink">Flemish</a> engraver and cartographer <a href="Jodocus_Hondius" title="wikilink">Jodocus Hondius</a>, who lived in London between 1584 and 1593 to escape religious difficulties in Flanders. This can be discerned from the phrase &quot;<em>Iodocus Hon: / dius Flan. sc. / 1592</em>&quot; on the celestial globe that appears together with Sanderson's <a href="coat_of_arms" title="wikilink">coat of arms</a> and a dedication to the Queen dated 1592. Molyneux's own name is set out on the Middle Temple terrestrial globe in the phrase &quot;<em>Emerius Mulleneux Angl.' / sumptibus Gulielmi— / Sandersoni Londin&lt;U+0113&gt;: / sis descripsit</em>&quot; (&quot;Emery Molyneux of England, at the expense of William Sanderson of London, described this&quot;).<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="celestial-globes">Celestial globes</h4>
<p>Molyneux's celestial globe was virtually a copy of <a href="Gerardus_Mercator" title="wikilink">Gerardus Mercator</a>'s globe of 1551, which itself was based on a globe of 1537 by <a href="Gemma_Frisius" title="wikilink">Gemma Frisius</a> that Mercator had helped to construct.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> To the <a href="constellation" title="wikilink">constellations</a> featured on Mercator's globe, Molyneux added the <a href="Crux" title="wikilink">Southern Cross</a> and <a href="Triangulum_Australe" title="wikilink">Southern Triangle</a>, rather too far to the west of their true positions. His source appears to have been <a href="Andrea_Corsali" title="wikilink">Andrea Corsali</a>'s diagram of the <a href="Antarctica" title="wikilink">Antarctic</a> sky published<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> in 1550.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Molyneux's globes were the first to be constructed in such a way that they were unaffected by humidity at sea. They were made of flour-paste, which was an unusual material for the time. Simon Forman remarked that Molyneux's <a href="Molding_(process)" title="wikilink">moulding</a> or <a href="casting" class="uri" title="wikilink">casting</a> process was &quot;the only way to caste [anything] whatsoever in perfecte forme... and yt is the perfectest and trewest waie of all wayes... and this was the wai that Mullenax did use to cast flowere [flour] in the verie forme&quot;.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>The impending publication of Molyneux's terrestrial globe was announced by Hakluyt at the end of the preface to his 1589 work <em>The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation</em>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Referring to the map that was inserted into the volume – a reproduction of the &quot;<em>Typus Orbis Terrarum</em>&quot; engraved by Franciscus Hogenberg for <a href="Abraham_Ortelius" title="wikilink">Abraham Ortelius</a>' <em><a href="Theatrum_Orbis_Terrarum" title="wikilink">Theatrum Orbis Terrarum</a></em> (1570),<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> he wrote:</p>

<p>Molyneux's progress in manufacturing the globes was reported by Ubaldini in letters to the Duke of Milan. Ubaldini was in attendance when Molyneux presented a pair of <a href="manuscript" class="uri" title="wikilink">manuscript</a> globes to Elizabeth I at <a href="Greenwich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greenwich</a> in July 1591,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> and noted that &quot;he gave her the globe to let her see at a glance how much of the world she could control by means of her naval forces&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> According to Wallis, the printed globes were published after some delay in the late months of 1592 or some time between January and March 1593.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Sanderson arranged entertainments at his home in <a href="Newington_Butts" title="wikilink">Newington Butts</a> to present these globes to the Queen. His son, also named William, recorded that on being given the terrestrial globe she remarked, &quot;The whole earth, a present for a Prince...&quot;. When she was presented the celestial globe at a second entertainment, she said, &quot;Thou hast presented me with the Heavens also: God guide me, to Govern my part of the one, that I may enjoy but a mansion place in this other.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Shortly after, several treatises were published to describe the Molyneux globes and provide guides to their use. Molyneux himself wrote a treatise, now lost, entitled <em>The Globes Celestial and Terrestrial Set Forth in Plano</em> (1592) which was published by Sanderson.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Also in 1592, Thomas Hood, a London-based mathematics lecturer, who had written a 1590 work on the use of celestial globes,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> published <em>The Vse of Both the Globes, Celestiall and Terrestriall</em>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> This was followed by two 1594 works, one of which was Blundeville's book. The other, <em>Tractatus de Globis et Eorum Usu</em> (<em>Treatise on Globes and their Use</em>, 1594),<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> was published by the mathematician Robert Hues;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> the work went into 13 printings and was translated from Latin into Dutch, English and French. In 1599, Edward Wright published <em>Certaine Errors in Navigation</em>,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> in which he wrote, among other things, about the use of the terrestrial and celestial globes that had been developed by Molyneux.</p>
<p>The largest and most prestigious globes were priced at up to &lt;U+00A3&gt;20 each; these were purchased by royalty, noblemen and academic institutions. Globes were purchased by the Warden of <a href="All_Souls_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">All Souls College</a> and <a href="Thomas_Bodley" title="wikilink">Thomas Bodley</a> for their libraries at <a href="Oxford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxford</a>, and William Sanderson presented the <a href="University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">Universities of Oxford</a> and <a href="University_of_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Cambridge</a> each with a pair.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> A Molyneux globe was also the inaugural gift to the <a href="Shrewsbury_School" title="wikilink">Shrewsbury School</a> library by the public preacher Thomas Laughton.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> In addition, smaller globes intended as practical navigation aids for sailors and students costing as low as &lt;U+00A3&gt;2 were made – no examples of these exist today.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> It is known that Sanderson presented a lesser globe to <a href="Robert_Cecil,_1st_Earl_of_Salisbury" title="wikilink">Robert Cecil</a> in 1595, together with Hues' &quot;Latin booke that teacheth the use of my great globes&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Markham, who was the editor of the 1889 reprint of an English edition of Hues' work, noted: &quot;The appearance of the globes naturally created a great sensation, and much interest was taken in appliances which were equally useful to the student and to the practical navigator.&quot;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> For navigators, the globe supplied methods of finding the place of the sun, <a href="latitude" class="uri" title="wikilink">latitude</a>, course and distance, amplitudes and <a href="azimuth" title="wikilink">azimuths</a>, time and <a href="declination" class="uri" title="wikilink">declination</a>, by inspection.

<p>In the 1590s, Molyneux sought Elizabeth I's patronage for the production of a <a href="cannon" class="uri" title="wikilink">cannon</a>, which he described as his &quot;new invention, of <a href="Lead_shot" title="wikilink">shot</a> and <a href="artillery" class="uri" title="wikilink">artillery</a>, to be used principally in <a href="naval_warfare" title="wikilink">naval warfare</a>: protection of ports and harbours, a new shot to discharge a thousand <a href="musket" class="uri" title="wikilink">musket</a> shot; with wildfire not to be quenched&quot;.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> In 1595 the merchant Robert Parkes purchased coal, <a href="Saltpeter" title="wikilink">saltpetre</a>, <a href="Pitch_(resin)" title="wikilink">pitch</a>, oils and waxes for him, possibly for the cannon. In March 1593 Molyneux was issued with a <a href="Royal_Warrant" title="wikilink">royal warrant</a> and the matter was considered by the <a href="Her_Majesty&#39;s_Most_Honourable_Privy_Council" title="wikilink">Privy Council</a> on <a href="4_November" title="wikilink">4 November</a> <a href="1596" class="uri" title="wikilink">1596</a>, when the <a href="Admiralty" title="wikilink">Lord Admiral</a> was urged &quot;to speak to Molyneux, Bussy and the two Engelberts about their offensive engines&quot;<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> as part of measures to defend England's south coast.

<p>Why Molyneux left England for Holland is unclear. The <em><a href="Dictionary_of_National_Biography" title="wikilink">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a></em> suggests it was to be able to personally distribute his globes to European princes, for Amsterdam was then quickly establishing itself as the centre of globe- and map-making.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> However, this could not have been his intention if he had sold the globes' plates to Hondius. It is possible that he had decided to concentrate on manufacturing ordnance. On <a href="26_January" title="wikilink">26 January</a> <a href="1598" class="uri" title="wikilink">1598</a>, the <a href="States-General_of_the_Netherlands" title="wikilink">States-General</a>, the parliament of the <a href="Dutch_Republic" title="wikilink">United Provinces</a>, showed interest in Molyneux's cannon and granted him a 12-year privilege on an invention. On <a href="6_June" title="wikilink">6 June</a> he lodged a second application, but died in Amsterdam almost immediately. His wife was granted <a href="Administrator_of_an_estate" title="wikilink">administration</a> of his <a href="Estate_(law)" title="wikilink">estate</a> in England later that month. It seems that Molyneux died in poverty, as Anne was granted a Dutch compassionate <a href="pension" class="uri" title="wikilink">pension</a> of 50 <a href="Dutch_guilder" title="wikilink">florins</a> on <a href="9_April" title="wikilink">9 April</a> <a href="1599" class="uri" title="wikilink">1599</a>.

<h3 id="cartography">Cartography</h3>
<p>In the third volume of the greatly-expanded version of his book <em>The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation</em> (1600),<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Hakluyt published what is known today as the Wright–Molyneux Map. Created by Edward Wright and based on Molyneux's terrestrial globe, it was the first map to use Wright's improvements on <a href="Mercator_projection" title="wikilink">Mercator's projection</a>.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>Having, it is believed, purchased the plates of Molyneux's globes, Jodocus Hondius was granted a ten-year privilege on <a href="1_April" title="wikilink">1 April</a> <a href="1597" class="uri" title="wikilink">1597</a> to make and publish a terrestrial globe, and in that year produced in Amsterdam a Dutch translation of Hues' <em>Tractatus de Globis</em>.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Despite a legal challenge by rival globe-maker Jacob van Langeren, Hondius obtained another privilege for ten years from <a href="31_October" title="wikilink">31 October</a> <a href="1598" class="uri" title="wikilink">1598</a>.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> He duly published globes in 1600 and 1601, and his sons Henricus and Jodocus published a pair in 1613. Hondius's world map of 1608 on the Mercator projection relied on Molyneux's globe as it bears a number of legends, names and outlines which must have been copied directly from the globe.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>In his globes of 1612, van Langeren incorporated the improvements to Molyneux's globe that Hondius the Elder had made, and it is believed that the Hondius globes spurred <a href="Willem_Blaeu" title="wikilink">Willem Blaeu</a> to start constructing his large globes in 1616, which were published in 1622. Molyneux's globes therefore had an indirect influence on Dutch globe-making.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="culture">Culture</h3>
<p>The appearance of Molyneux's globes had a significant influence on the culture of his time. In <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">Shakespeare</a>'s <em><a href="The_Comedy_of_Errors" title="wikilink">The Comedy of Errors</a></em>, written between 1592 and 1594, one of the <a href="protagonist" title="wikilink">protagonists</a>, Dromio of Syracuse, compares a kitchen maid to a terrestrial globe: &quot;No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out countries in her.&quot;<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The jest gained its point from the globes' publication, and Shakespeare may have personally seen them.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> <a href="Elizabethan_era" title="wikilink">Elizabethan</a> <a href="dramatist" class="uri" title="wikilink">dramatist</a> <a href="Thomas_Dekker" title="wikilink">Thomas Dekker</a> wrote in one of his plays published in <em>The Gull's Horn-book</em> (1609):<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>

<p>It has been suggested that the <a href="Lord_Chamberlain&#39;s_Men" title="wikilink">Lord Chamberlain's Men</a>, the <a href="playing_company" title="wikilink">playing company</a> that Shakespeare worked for as an actor and playwright for most of his career, named their playing space built in 1599 the <a href="Globe_Theatre" title="wikilink">Globe Theatre</a> as a response to growing enthusiasm for terrestrial and celestial globes that had been stimulated by those manufactured by Molyneux.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>In <em><a href="Twelfth_Night" title="wikilink">Twelfth Night</a></em> (1600–1601), Shakespeare alluded to the Wright–Molyneux Map by having Maria say teasingly of Malvolio: &quot;He does smile his face into more lynes, than is in the new Mappe, with the augmentation of the Indies.&quot;<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-globes-today">The globes today</h2>
<p>It appears that only six Molyneux globes are in existence today, two terrestrial globes and four celestial globes. Three celestial globes are in Germany, one each in <a href="Zerbst" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zerbst</a>, <a href="Nuremberg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nuremberg</a> (at the <a href="Germanisches_Nationalmuseum" title="wikilink">Germanisches Nationalmuseum</a> (German National Museum)) and <a href="Kassel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kassel</a> (<a href="Hessisches_Landesmuseum" title="wikilink">Hessisches Landesmuseum</a> (<a href="Hesse" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hesse</a> Museum), Kassel). The Hessisches Landesmuseum originally had a 1592 terrestrial globe, but this is believed to have been destroyed during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. Three globes remain in England: one pair, consisting of a terrestrial and a celestial globe, is presently owned by <a href="Middle_Temple" title="wikilink">Middle Temple</a> in London and is displayed in its library, while a terrestrial globe is at <a href="Petworth_House" title="wikilink">Petworth House</a> in <a href="Petworth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Petworth</a>, <a href="West_Sussex" title="wikilink">West Sussex</a>.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>

<p>A terrestrial globe<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> was discovered in <a href="Baron_Leconfield" title="wikilink">Lord Leconfield</a>'s library at <a href="Petworth_House" title="wikilink">Petworth House</a> in <a href="Petworth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Petworth</a>, <a href="West_Sussex" title="wikilink">West Sussex</a>, in July 1949. According to the tradition of the Wyndham family, who are descended from <a href="Henry_Percy,_9th_Earl_of_Northumberland" title="wikilink">Henry Percy, the 9th Earl of Northumberland</a>, the globe belonged to Sir Walter Raleigh who gave it to Northumberland when they were imprisoned together in the <a href="Tower_of_London" title="wikilink">Tower of London</a>. Northumberland, known as the &quot;Wizard Earl&quot; for his interest in scientific and <a href="Alchemy" title="wikilink">alchemical</a> experiments and his library,<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> was suspected of being involved in the <a href="Gunpowder_Plot" title="wikilink">Gunpowder Plot</a> of 1605 as his relative <a href="Thomas_Percy_(plotter)" title="wikilink">Thomas Percy</a> was one of the conspirators. Raleigh was imprisoned in the Tower for treason due to his alleged involvement in the <a href="Main_Plot" title="wikilink">Main Plot</a> against <a href="James_I_of_England" title="wikilink">James I</a>. Although the theory is supported by <a href="circumstantial_evidence" title="wikilink">circumstantial evidence</a>, a number of entries in Northumberland's accounts relating to the mending of globes, one dating back to 1596, suggest that the Molyneux globe belonged to him from the beginning and was not Raleigh's.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> It is, however, almost certain that the globe spent many years in the Tower before being transferred to Petworth House where Northumberland was confined upon his release in 1621.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>The Petworth House globe, presently in the North Gallery, is valuable for being the only Molyneux terrestrial globe existing in its original 1592 state. One of Molyneux's &quot;great globes&quot;, measuring  in diameter, it was reported in 1952 to have been in poor condition despite restoration by the <a href="British_Museum" title="wikilink">British Museum</a> the previous year.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The <a href="northern_hemisphere" title="wikilink">northern hemisphere</a> was darkened by dirt and badly rubbed in places to the extent that it was hard to read. Some parts of it, and large sections of the <a href="southern_hemisphere" title="wikilink">southern hemisphere</a>, are missing altogether.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The restoration work revealed that the globe is weighted with sand and made from layers of small pieces of paper overlaid with a coat of <a href="plaster" class="uri" title="wikilink">plaster</a> about  thick. On top of this is another layer of paper over which the gores are pasted. The globe retains its wooden horizon circle and brass <a href="Meridian_(geography)" title="wikilink">meridian</a> ring, but its hour circle and index are missing.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Further restoration took place between 1995 and 1997.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="middle-temple-globes">Middle Temple globes</h3>
<p>The earliest reference to the Molyneux terrestrial and celestial globes<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> being in the possession of the Middle Temple is a bill in the accounts for <a href="11_April" title="wikilink">11 April</a> <a href="1717" class="uri" title="wikilink">1717</a> for &quot;repairing the globes in the library&quot;.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Markham's view was that Robert Ashley (1565–1641), a <a href="Barristers_in_England_and_Wales" title="wikilink">barrister</a> of the Middle Temple who was also an ardent <a href="geographer" class="uri" title="wikilink">geographer</a>, was likely to have owned the globes and left them to the <a href="Inns_of_Court" title="wikilink">Inn</a> together with his books in his will. Ashley's books formed the nucleus of the Inn's original library, and included copies of the second edition of Hues' <em>Tractatus de Globis</em> and other works on <a href="cosmography" class="uri" title="wikilink">cosmography</a>.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> On the other hand, Wallis has said that Markham's view is not supported by any available evidence and the globes are not specifically mentioned in the will. She feels that they were probably acquired on their publication in 1603.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>

<p>The celestial globe is dated 1592 but the terrestrial globe bears the year 1603, the only example of its kind.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Wallis has surmised that the globes were made by Hondius in Amsterdam in 1603 after receiving an order from England, perhaps from the Middle Temple itself. The celestial globe was made from the original 1592 printing plates, while the terrestrial globe was produced using revised plates that were redated to 1603.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> The Petworth House terrestrial globe of 1592 differs from the Middle Temple one in that the latter incorporated Raleigh's discoveries in <a href="Guyanas" title="wikilink">Guiana</a><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> and provided new place-names in <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a> and <a href="Peru" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peru</a>, and on the continent of <a href="Africa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Africa</a>. An island marked &quot;<a href="Korea" title="wikilink">Corea</a>&quot; off the coast of <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a> was also added. The most extensive revision was that to the <a href="Northeast_Passage" title="wikilink">Northeast Passage</a>, which was amended to take into account discoveries made on <a href="Willem_Barentsz" title="wikilink">Willem Barentsz</a>'s third voyage to <a href="Novaya_Zemlya" title="wikilink">Novaya Zemlya</a> in 1596. It appears that the revisions to the original plates of Molyneux's globe were completed by 1597, as no discoveries after that year are included.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> It is possible that Molyneux helped Hondius to update the plates in 1596 or 1597. For instance, if Hondius had obtained a copy of Raleigh's map of Guiana, Molyneux was most likely his source.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Unlike the Petworth House globe, the Middle Temple globes are heavily <a href="varnish" title="wikilink">varnished</a>. The varnish could have been first applied as early as 1818 when the globes were repaired by J. and W. Newton, and they were certainly varnished by Messrs. Holland Hannen &amp; Cubitts, Ltd. during maintenance work performed in 1930.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>At the start of World War II, the globes were sent to <a href="Beaconsfield" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beaconsfield</a> and stored with part of the <a href="Wallace_Collection" title="wikilink">Wallace Collection</a> at Hall Barn in the care of <a href="Baron_Burnham" title="wikilink">Lady Burnham</a>. They were brought back to London in 1945, and were at one stage placed in the <a href="King&#39;s_Library" title="wikilink">King's Library</a> on loan to the British Museum.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a><a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> The globes were installed in the position where they now stand in Middle Temple Library when the current library building opened in 1958.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> In 2003, the globes were loaned to the <a href="National_Maritime_Museum" title="wikilink">National Maritime Museum</a> for an exhibition commemorating the life of Elizabeth I.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2004, Middle Temple proposed the sale of the Molyneux globes, valued at over &lt;U+00A3&gt;1 million, to create a scholarship fund for the education and training of needy would-be barristers. Its members eventually decided by a large majority against such a move. There was also a general feeling that the globes should be made more accessible to those wishing to see them.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>The Middle Temple's Molyneux globes are the subject of a book-length project, <em>The Molyneux Globes: Mathematical Practice and Theory</em>, by Dr. Lesley B. Cormack, Professor and Chair of the Department of History and Classics of the Faculty of Arts, <a href="University_of_Alberta" title="wikilink">University of Alberta</a>.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> The project examines the community of mathematicians, <a href="Natural_philosophy" title="wikilink">natural philosophers</a>, instrument-makers, and gentlemen-virtuosi that developed around the creation of the Molyneux globes, particularly the histories of four men who wrote treatises about the globes and the larger mathematical community.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="hessisches-landesmuseum-globe">Hessisches Landesmuseum globe</h3>
<p>The Molyneux globes at the Hessisches Landesmuseum, Kassel, were inherited from the collection of <a href="William_IV,_Landgrave_of_Hesse-Kassel" title="wikilink">William IV</a> (William the Wise), the <a href="Landgrave" class="uri" title="wikilink">Landgrave</a> of <a href="Hesse-Kassel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hesse-Kassel</a>, who was a pioneer of <a href="Astronomy" title="wikilink">astronomical</a> research. As William died in 1592 it has been surmised that his son and successor, <a href="Maurice,_Landgrave_of_Hesse-Kassel" title="wikilink">Maurice</a>, purchased the globes for the collection. The globes were first mentioned in the index of the Mathematische Kammer (Mathematics Chamber) of the F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstliches Kunsthaus (Princely Art Gallery) in Kassel in the reign of Landgrave Frederick III in 1765.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Only a celestial globe survives today; it is believed that the terrestrial globe was destroyed during World War II.</p>
