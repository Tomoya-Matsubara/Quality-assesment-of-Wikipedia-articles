Many variations of the recipe exist. They generally include liberal quantities of <a href="boiled" class="uri" title="wikilink">boiled</a> <a href="potato" title="wikilink">potatoes</a>, butter and <a href="salt" class="uri" title="wikilink">salt</a>.</p>
<p>Potato scones are traditionally made as circles of about 90 mm in radius and then cut into quarters. They may also be baked in small rounds.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> They are generally unleavened and are thinner, 7 mm or so, than what is usually considered a scone; they resemble a soft <a href="oatcake" class="uri" title="wikilink">oatcake</a>. They are often served as part of the <a href="full_Scottish_breakfast" title="wikilink">full Scottish breakfast</a> with fried eggs, bacon and <a href="sliced_sausage" title="wikilink">sliced sausage</a>. Alternatively, they are often enjoyed in a <a href="Bread_roll" title="wikilink">roll</a>, usually accompanied with either sliced sausage, <a href="bacon" class="uri" title="wikilink">bacon</a>, or <a href="fried_egg" title="wikilink">fried egg</a>.</p>
<p>A typical potato scone is made with <a href="mashed_potato" title="wikilink">mashed potato</a> (potato and butter&lt;U+2014&gt;no milk is used&lt;U+2014&gt;with salt to taste) and plain flour is added to make it into a dough which is then rolled out and put on a <a href="griddle" class="uri" title="wikilink">griddle</a> to cook.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> They are traditionally served hot, and cold potato scones are often reheated by toasting or frying. Potato scones contain a small proportion of flour to a large proportion of potatoes: one traditional recipe calls for two ounces of flour and half an ounce of butter to a pound of potatoes <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
