<p>On the outbreak of the Second World War, additional units were placed under Brownell's purview at RAAF Base Pearce and he was consequently promoted to temporary group captain in December 1939.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> With the introduction of <a href="Lockheed_Hudson" title="wikilink">Lockheed Hudson</a> aircraft to the Royal Australian Air Force in February 1940, several units were re-equipped, including <a href="No._14_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 14 Squadron</a> at RAAF Base Pearce. The Hudsons replaced the squadron's <a href="Avro_Anson" title="wikilink">Avro Ansons</a>, which were to be ferried back to the eastern coast of Australia in order to be used as training aircraft.

<p>During August 1940, Brownell was ordered to Singapore in order to establish and command an RAAF station on the island, as well as administer the RAAF squadrons located in <a href="Malaysia" title="wikilink">Malaya</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Embarking aboard the SS <em>Strathallan</em> in mid-August, Brownell and his staff formed the RAAF station within two weeks of arrival at <a href="Sembawang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sembawang</a>.

<p>Promoted to acting air commodore, Brownell returned to Australia during August 1941 and was appointed Air Officer Commanding No. 1 Training Group in Melbourne. With this position, Brownell was in command of approximately thirty establishments located in southern Australia. On 1 January 1943, he was posted as Air Officer Commanding Western Area. Based at RAAF Base Pearce, Brownell's responsibilities involved coordinating training and directing long-range bombing operations.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Following intelligence reports that a Japanese force was en-route to raid Western Australia, the <a href="Australian_Government" title="wikilink">Australian Government</a> ordered a build-up to defences in the area. In response to this, Brownell organised air defences around <a href="Perth,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Perth</a> and the <a href="Exmouth_Gulf" title="wikilink">Exmouth Gulf</a> during March 1944. With the use of Army transports, he also reinforced <a href="Cunderdin,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Cunderdin</a> with supplies and bombs for the use of the heavy bombers in the area. The attack from the Japanese, however, did not occur.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> For his service as Air Officer Commanding Western Area, Brownell was appointed a <a href="Commander_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the 1945 New Years Honours.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Relinquishing command of Western Area in July 1945, Brownell was appointed commander of the recently formed <a href="No._11_Group_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 11 Group</a>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> No. 11 Group was established as a static organisation that was to take administrative control of all RAAF units based on <a href="Morotai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Morotai</a>.

In addition to this, the unit held the three main responsibilities of local air defence and sea lane protection, support of adjacent formations and offensive operations against Japanese targets within range, as well as line-of-communication duties. The unit, however, was formed too late in the war to assume all of its responsibilities before the Second World War drew to an end.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Brownell was present at the Japanese surrenders in <a href="Manila" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manila</a>, <a href="Tokyo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tokyo</a>, and on Morotai.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> He was selected by the Australian government to attend the ceremony aboard the <a href="USS_Missouri_(BB-63)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Missouri</em></a> on 2 September 1945, but was replaced by the <a href="Chief_of_Air_Force_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, <a href="Air_Vice_Marshal" title="wikilink">Air Vice Marshal</a> <a href="George_Jones_(RAAF_officer)" title="wikilink">George Jones</a>, when Jones became available to make the trip to Japan.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="later-life">Later life</h2>
<p>Returning to Western Australia after the war,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Brownell attended an investiture ceremony at <a href="Government_House,_Perth" title="wikilink">Government House, Perth</a> on 3 January 1947, where he was presented with his Commander of the Order of the British Empire by the Lieutenant-<a href="Governor_of_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Governor of Western Australia</a>.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> On 24 March that year, Brownell retired from the Royal Australian Air Force on medical grounds.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> He had in any case been slated for early retirement, along with a number of other senior officers and veterans of the First World War, to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>Following his retirement from the Air Force, Brownell was made a partner of S. G. Brearley &amp; Co., a stockbroking firm located in Perth. In 1951, he was made chairman of the associated sporting committee of the National Fitness Council of Western Australia; he served in this role until 1967. Aged 79, Brownell died at <a href="Subiaco,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Subiaco, Western Australia</a>, on 12 April 1974 and was accorded a funeral with full Air Force honours. Brownell's autobiography, <em>From Khaki to Blue</em>, was posthumously published in 1978.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
