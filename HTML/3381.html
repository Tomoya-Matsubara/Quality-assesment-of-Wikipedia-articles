<p>The <strong>John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum</strong> is the <a href="presidential_library" title="wikilink">presidential library</a> and <a href="museum" class="uri" title="wikilink">museum</a> of the 35th <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President of the United States</a>, <a href="John_F._Kennedy" title="wikilink">John F.

It was designed by the architect <a href="I._M._Pei" title="wikilink">I. M. Pei</a>. The building is the official repository for original papers and correspondence of the Kennedy Administration, as well as special bodies of published and unpublished materials, such as books and papers by and about <a href="Ernest_Hemingway" title="wikilink">Ernest Hemingway</a>. The library and museum were dedicated in 1979 by President <a href="Jimmy_Carter" title="wikilink">Jimmy Carter</a> and members of the <a href="Kennedy_family" title="wikilink">Kennedy family</a>.

<p>During weekend visit to <a href="Boston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boston</a> on October 19, 1963, President Kennedy, along with <a href="John_Carl_Warnecke" title="wikilink">John Carl Warnecke</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; the architect who would design the President&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="John_F._Kennedy_Eternal_Flame" title="wikilink">tomb in Arlington</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> &lt;U+2014&gt; viewed several locations offered by <a href="Harvard" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harvard</a> as a site for the library and museum. At the time there were only four other <a href="Presidential_Library" title="wikilink">Presidential Libraries</a>; The <a href="Hoover_Presidential_Library" title="wikilink">Hoover Presidential Library</a>, the <a href="Franklin_D._Roosevelt_Presidential_Library" title="wikilink">Franklin D. Roosevelt Library</a>, the <a href="Truman_Library" title="wikilink">Truman Library</a>, and the <a href="Dwight_D._Eisenhower_Library" title="wikilink">Dwight D. Eisenhower Library</a>. They were all scattered around the country in small towns from New York to Iowa. He hadn&lt;U+2019&gt;t decided on any design concept yet, but he felt that the existing Presidential Libraries were placed too far &lt;U+201C&gt;away from scholarly resources.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Kennedy chose a plot of land next to the <a href="Harvard_Graduate_School_of_Business_Administration" title="wikilink">Graduate School of Business Administration</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The building would face the <a href="Charles_River" title="wikilink">Charles River</a> which was a few feet away, and on the other side of which, the dormitories that included <a href="Winthrop_House" title="wikilink">Winthrop House</a> where Kennedy spent his upperclassman days.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Kennedy was <a href="JFK_assassination" title="wikilink">assassinated</a> a month later, on <a href="November_22" title="wikilink">November 22</a>, <a href="1963" class="uri" title="wikilink">1963</a>.</p>
<p>Being that Kennedy encouraged his <a href="Kennedy_Administration" title="wikilink">Administration</a> to save affects of both personal and official nature, the complex would not just be a collection of the President&lt;U+2019&gt;s papers, but &lt;U+201C&gt;a complete record of a Presidential era.&lt;U+201D&gt; And so, the building would have the word museum appended to its name: <strong>John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum</strong>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="initial-progress">Initial progress</h3>
<p>Progress on the building began shortly after his death. On January 13, 1964, the then <a href="Attorney_General" title="wikilink">Attorney General</a> <a href="Robert_F._Kennedy" title="wikilink">Robert F. Kennedy</a> announced that a taped oral-history project was to be undertaken for inclusion in the library. The project would feature his Administration staff, friends, <a href="Kennedy_family" title="wikilink">family</a> and politicians from home and abroad. The Attorney General also announced that <a href="Eugene_R._Black,_Sr." title="wikilink">Eugene R. Black, Sr.</a> agreed to serve as chairman of the board of trustees and that $1 million of Black&lt;U+2019&gt;s $10 million goal had been given to the trust by the <a href="Joseph_P._Kennedy_Jr._Foundation" title="wikilink">Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The death of the President was still fresh in the hearts and minds of the American public and by March of that year $4.3 million had been pledged, including 18,727 unsolicited donations from the public.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Large donations came from the Hispanic world with <a href="Venezuela" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venezuela</a> pledging $100,000 and <a href="Governor_of_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Governor of Puerto Rico</a>, <a href="Luis_Mu&lt;U+00F1&gt;oz_Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;n" title="wikilink">Luis Mu&lt;U+00F1&gt;oz Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;n</a> offering the same. The oral-history project also began recording, starting with <a href="Jacqueline_Kennedy" title="wikilink">Mrs. Kennedy</a> and Robert Kennedy. Originally projected to consist of interviews with 150 people, 178 had agreed to participate and the total number of expected participants doubled to 300, with just one person declining to take part, a <a href="Secret_Service" title="wikilink">Secret Service</a> agent.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Also by this time fourteen <a href="architects" class="uri" title="wikilink">architects</a> were named to serve on a design advisory committee:<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Over the following months pledges continued to funnel in for the building still being conceptualized by the various architects. Some notable donations include $900,000 handed over to the <a href="Postmaster_General" title="wikilink">Postmaster General</a>, <a href="John_A._Gronouski" title="wikilink">John A. Gronouski</a> on July 9, 1964. It was the sum of a campaign encompassing 102 Federal agencies. Gronouski said many of the Federal employee contributions were in the form of a $5 withholding each payday for a period of three years.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The next day the Indian Ambassador to the United States, <a href="Braj_Kumar_Nehru" title="wikilink">Braj Kumar Nehru</a> presented Mr. Black with a check for $100,000 during a ceremony at the River Club. Mr. Nehru said that the <a href="Indian_people" title="wikilink">Indian people</a> were hit by a &lt;U+201C&gt;sad blow&lt;U+201D&gt; when the President died, and that they held him &lt;U+201C&gt;in the highest regard, esteem and affection.&lt;U+201D&gt; He desired for Indian students abroad in the US to utilize the library, at the time, still planned for construction at Harvard along the banks of the Charles River.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

Pei was unanimously chosen by a subcommittee as the architect of the library.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Even though Pei was relatively unknown amongst the list of candidates, Mrs. Kennedy, who viewed him as filled with promise and imagination and after spending several months inspecting the many architects&lt;U+2019&gt; offices and creations, selected him to create the vision she held for the project.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Pei did not have a design yet, but the idea as described by Robert Kennedy was to &lt;U+201C&gt;stimulate interest in politics.&lt;U+201D&gt; Meanwhile, the suggestion that Harvard may not be a suitable site for the library had begun cropping up. When asked if Pei may have had to start from scratch, he said this was the case. With an &lt;U+201C&gt;encouraging grin&lt;U+201D&gt; Robert Kennedy simply wished Mr. Pei &lt;U+201C&gt;Good luck.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Not long before Pei was selected, the $10 million goal set by Mr. Black had been reached.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> By 1965, fundraising was suspended when the contributions reached $20 million.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>In January 1966, when <a href="Governor_of_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Massachusetts Governor</a> <a href="John_A._Volpe" title="wikilink">John A.

Kennedy Library and Museum, the <a href="John_F._Kennedy_School_of_Government" title="wikilink">John F. Kennedy School of Government</a>, and an <a href="Institute_of_Politics" title="wikilink">Institute of Politics</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> However the project faced many delays. The MTA would not agree to remove the heavy machinery from the land until 1970. By that time construction costs had risen to over $20 million.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Only now could Pei prepare a six-month study of the site&lt;U+2019&gt;s soil, and he said the &lt;U+201C&gt;money we had six years ago, today will barely pay for 60 percent of the original plans.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Robert Kennedy, by then a New York Senator, had been serving as president of the John F. Kennedy Library Corporation until he was <a href="RFK_assassination" title="wikilink">shot and killed</a> in 1968. Weeks before, <a href="William_Manchester" title="wikilink">William Manchester</a> and <a href="Harper_&amp;_Row" title="wikilink">Harper &amp; Row</a> donated $750,000 to the library.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The first in a series of installments expected to total $5 million, came from the profits of the book <em><a href="The_Death_of_a_President" title="wikilink">The Death of a President</a></em> which caused a bitter feud between the Kennedy&lt;U+2019&gt;s and Manchester. Mrs. Kennedy remarked &lt;U+201C&gt;I think it is so beautiful what Mr. Manchester did. I am glad that Senator Kennedy knew about it before he died.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The youngest of the <a href="Kennedy_family#Third_generation" title="wikilink">Kennedy brothers</a>, <a href="Ted_Kennedy" title="wikilink">Senator Edward Kennedy</a>, would step down as vice president of the corporation to fill the newly vacant position.</p>
<p>By 1971, construction had still not begun; researchers and scholars were forced to work out of the Federal Records Center which was temporarily housing some of the 15 million documents and manuscripts. Pei said there was finally &lt;U+201C&gt;a clear way ahead,&lt;U+201D&gt; however, he was asked to save on construction expenses by using inexpensive materials.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> This would translate into Pei working with concrete instead of his preferred stone.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>On May 22, 1971, President Kennedy&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="Vice_President" title="wikilink">Vice President</a> and successor, <a href="Lyndon_B._Johnson" title="wikilink">Lyndon B.

On the campus of the <a href="University_of_Texas_at_Austin" title="wikilink">University of Texas at Austin</a>, and next to the <a href="LBJ_School_of_Public_Affairs" title="wikilink">LBJ School of Public Affairs</a>, he would beat the Kennedy team to building the first Presidential Library that also served as a place of scholarly research. He would not live to see work begin on his predecessors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Cambridge community was in fierce opposition of having library being built in Cambridge at all. Although originally welcomed in 1965, the library was now seen as a great attractor of over a million annual tourists who would change the neighborhood with &lt;U+201C&gt;hordes of tourists, automobiles, fast-food franchises and souvenir shops,&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> as well as cause a negative environmental impact.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> One neighborhood group would file a Federal suit demanding that the <a href="General_Services_Administration" title="wikilink">General Services Administration</a> study, which found that the great number of visitors would have &lt;U+201C&gt;no adverse effect on the area,&lt;U+201D&gt; be reexamined.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Stephen E. Smith, a Kennedy in-law who heads the John F. Kennedy Library Corporation decided that &lt;U+201C&gt;we want the Kennedy Library to be a happy place. It would not be in keeping with the nature of this memorial for it to open in an atmosphere of discord and controversy.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> And in February, 1975 the plans for having the library where President Kennedy would have wanted it, were dropped.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

A commuter campus of the <a href="University_of_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">University of Massachusetts</a>, described as a group of &lt;U+201C&gt;massive, blocky structures&lt;U+2026&gt;in sharp contrast to the mellow and urbane atmosphere of the library&lt;U+2019&gt;s original site near Harvard Square.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The site was originally a <a href="garbage_dump" title="wikilink">garbage dump</a>, Pei recalls finding old refrigerators and appliances under the soil.

<p>June 12, 1977 marked the official <a href="groundbreaking_ceremony" title="wikilink">groundbreaking</a> for the library with construction following in August.

<p>The official dedication was held on October 20, 1979.

<p>The audiovisual archives contain over 400,000 still photographs taken from 1863&lt;U+2013&gt;1984, over 7.5 million feet (2.29&lt;U+00D7&gt;<a href="one_million" title="wikilink">10<sup>6</sup></a> m) of film shot between 1910&lt;U+2013&gt;83, and 11,000 reels of audio recordings from 1910&lt;U+2013&gt;85.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="oral-history-project">Oral-history project</h3>
<p>Begun in 1964, the oral-history project was a unique undertaking to document and preserve interviews with those associated with Kennedy. Initially expected to have about 150 participants<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a>, today it contains over 1,100 interviews and continues to this day.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> It is modelled after a program by the <a href="Columbia_University_Oral_History_Research_Office" title="wikilink">Columbia University Oral History Research Office</a>, the worlds oldest, which began in 1948.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> At its conception, while serving as Attorney General, Robert Kennedy speculated that some of the interviews, such as ones relating to the Cuban missile crisis might have to be sealed for a while, due to containing &quot;highly classified material.&quot; He said that although the emphasis would be on releasing everything as soon as possible, some items might remain closed for 10 to 25 years.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>Because the interviewees are allowed to review their transcripts before the interviews are released for use by scholars, the audio may differ from the written record; so that the interviewing may disambiguate any misunderstanding in their speech and make it clear in a written form.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="artifacts">Artifacts</h3>
<p>The library keeps a wide range of artifacts, many of which can be found in their respective exhibits. One of the more peculiar items is the original coconut on which the rescue message was inscribed by Kennedy to rescue the crew of the <a href="PT-109" class="uri" title="wikilink">PT-109</a> and delivered by natives of <a href="Biuku_Gasa_and_Eroni_Kumana" title="wikilink">Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana</a> of the <a href="Solomon_Islands" title="wikilink">Solomon Islands</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
