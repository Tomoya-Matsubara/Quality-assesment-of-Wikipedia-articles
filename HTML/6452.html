<p>&quot;SexyBack&quot; was written and produced by Justin Timberlake, <a href="Timbaland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Timbaland</a>, and <a href="Danja" title="wikilink">Nate &quot;Danja&quot; Hills</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In December 2005, Timberlake began working on his second album, <em><a href="FutureSex/LoveSounds" class="uri" title="wikilink">FutureSex/LoveSounds</a></em>, the follow-up to his 2002 album <em><a href="Justified" class="uri" title="wikilink">Justified</a></em>. Within three weeks, &quot;SexyBack&quot; was one of several songs that were recorded.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In September 2006, Timberlake told <em><a href="The_Malay_Mail" title="wikilink">The Weekend Mail</a></em> that &quot;SexyBack&quot; was the &quot;second or third song&quot; he did with Timbaland in a list of 10 songs they recorded for the album. &quot;It was just an experiment gone right from the sort of synthesizer influence to the distorted vocals&quot;, said Timberlake. &quot;It's one of the songs that the more you listen to it its just hook after hook after hook. Its just one of those 'flow off the top of your head' tracks, in terms of melody. We wanted to keep it lose and not too rehearsed, it's one of those very experimental records though.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Timberlake revealed to <a href="MTV_News" title="wikilink">MTV News</a> that he went &quot;left&quot;, regarding going more rock, not in how he developed the song, but in the way he sang the song. &quot;I wanted to sing the song like a rock and roll singer, not an R&amp;B singer. That's the approach.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In another interview, Timberlake said that he modeled himself on musicians <a href="David_Bowie" title="wikilink">David Bowie</a> and <a href="Prince_(musician)" title="wikilink">Prince</a>, and described the song as Bowie and <a href="David_Byrne" title="wikilink">David Byrne</a> covering <a href="James_Brown" title="wikilink">James Brown</a>'s 1970 song &quot;<a href="Get_Up_(I_Feel_Like_Being_a)_Sex_Machine" title="wikilink">Sex Machine</a>&quot; and concluded with, &quot;That's all of my influences for that song.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Timberlake himself said that the song &quot;doesn't qualify as rock or straight funk&quot; and that he was happy with the description &quot;club funk&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In another interview he said he was &quot;keen for a new musical direction&quot; following the release of his first album, <em>Justified</em>. &quot;I listened to the radio for a few months and thought, 'All this sounds like shit, what do I want to hear?'. That's really all I did. Everything's  got so repetitive, everything sounds the same. I had to create something unique otherwise there's no point putting it out.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

'I'm bringing sexy back, yeah! I'm bringing. . .' It's a very physical song, meant to provoke ... sexual dance.

<p>Timberlake decided to work with director Michael Haussman, following his work on <a href="Madonna_(entertainer)" title="wikilink">Madonna</a>'s 1994 music video for &quot;<a href="Take_a_Bow_(Madonna_song)" title="wikilink">Take a Bow</a>&quot;. &quot;It's one of my favorite videos Madonna's ever done,&quot; Timberlake said. &quot;Even today, I still remember the visuals, the images, how he captured her. A lot of times, Madonna seems like she's the person in control, and in that video, she seemed vulnerable. It was a cool thing to see.&quot;<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> The video was first shown on <a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a>'s <em><a href="Making_the_Video" title="wikilink">Making the Video</a></em> on July 25, 2006.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>The video starts off with a cable car looking over a large city (Barcelona, from the West looking East) and switches to a luxurious-looking hotel in Pla&lt;U+00E7&gt;a de Catalunya with Elena Anaya taking off her sweater. It then cuts to Timberlake in a different room; then to a club scene and Timberlake in front of a white background. The video alternates between those four viewpoints, with Timberlake and Anaya seeming to be spies in the hotel room and strangers in the club. At a certain point, Timberlake goes over to Anaya's room by jumping over to her balcony. Then when Anaya goes to check it out, Timberlake traps her and they have sex. In the club, it ends with Timberlake cornering Anaya in a bathroom stall. In the hotel room scene, Timberlake leaves by the same way he entered and moments later jumps back to the balcony before an explosion ensues. It ends with the figure of Anaya sitting in a chair beside a small television in which a kiss is frozen on the screen.</p>
