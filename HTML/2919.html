<p>In an attempt to repeat the success of his previous year's Christmas hit, &quot;<a href="In_Dulci_Jubilo_/_On_Horseback" title="wikilink">In Dulci Jubilo</a>&quot;, Mike recorded another traditional folk melody dating from 1701 (first known publication),<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> again using <a href="Leslie_Penning" title="wikilink">Leslie Penning</a> on <a href="recorder" title="wikilink">recorders</a>. The single was just as successful as its predecessor, charting at number 3 in the <a href="UK_Singles_Chart" title="wikilink">UK</a>,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and became his first non-album single to be issued in the USA. It also charted at number 19 in <a href="Irish_Singles_Chart" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>. Mike Oldfield plays acoustic guitar, accordion, mandolin, <a href="ARP_String_Synthesizer" title="wikilink">ARP string synthesiser</a>, tambourine, kettle drum and <a href="bodhran" class="uri" title="wikilink">bodhran</a> (Irish drum), and both Oldfield and Penning are credited with &quot;<a href="step_dance" title="wikilink">feet</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>This song, plus two others chosen as the B-side in different countries, had been released the month before as three of four new songs on the compilation album <em><a href="Boxed_(Mike_Oldfield_album)" title="wikilink">Boxed</a></em>. They were mixed and encoded for SQ <a href="quadraphonic" class="uri" title="wikilink">quadraphonic</a> sound, the only format this album was issued in, and all issues of these songs in vinyl and tape formats have the encoding, even if they only say &quot;stereo&quot; on the label, as do all single releases.</p>
<p>&quot;Argiers&quot; is another traditional folk song, performed by Leslie Penning on recorders and Mike Oldfield on acoustic guitar and <a href="ARP_String_Synthesizer" title="wikilink">ARP string synthesiser</a>. An unusual feature of this arrangement is that it is in a minor key, having been converted from its original major key via <a href="transposition_(music)" title="wikilink">diatonic transposition</a>. &quot;Portsmouth&quot; and &quot;Argiers&quot; were both recorded in January 1976 at Througham, <a href="Gloucestershire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gloucestershire</a>, Mike's new home studio, shortly after he moved from his previous home in <a href="Hergest_Ridge" title="wikilink">Hergest Ridge</a>, which was the location of his previous home studio, the Beacon.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;Speak (Tho' You Only Say Farewell)&quot; is an old show tune performed by <a href="David_Bedford" title="wikilink">David Bedford</a> on piano and vocals, and Mike Oldfield on vocals. It is similar in style to Bedford's earlier work in the <a href="Coxhill-Bedford_Duo" title="wikilink">Coxhill-Bedford Duo</a> with <a href="Lol_Coxhill" title="wikilink">Lol Coxhill</a>, and was recorded at the Beacon in November 1974.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The song is featured on the <a href="Mercury_Records" title="wikilink">Mercury Records</a> reissue of <em><a href="Ommadawn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ommadawn</a></em>, released on 7 June 2010.</p>

<p>A music video was made for this song, and can be found on the DVD, <em><a href="Elements_-_The_Best_of_Mike_Oldfield_(video)" title="wikilink">Elements - The Best of Mike Oldfield</a></em>. Shot in Mike's Througham studio, it shows four female folk dancers who dance around the studio, while Mike is seen playing various instruments. As in the video for Mike's previous single, &quot;In Dulci Jubilo&quot;, the video emphasizes that Mike plays all the instruments, even though this is not strictly true.</p>
