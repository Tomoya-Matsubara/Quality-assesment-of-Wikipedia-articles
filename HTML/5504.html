The <a href="kingdom_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">kingdom of Georgia</a> flourished during the 10th to 12th centuries, and fell to the <a href="Mongol_invasions_of_Georgia_and_Armenia" title="wikilink">Mongol invasions of Georgia and Armenia</a> by 1243, and after a brief reunion under <a href="George_V_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">George V of Georgia</a> to the <a href="Timur&#39;s_invasions_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">Timurid Empire</a>. By 1490, Georgia was fragmented into a number of petty kingdoms and principalities, which throughout the Early Modern period struggled to maintain their autonomy against <a href="Safavid_dynasty" title="wikilink">Safavid</a> and <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman</a> domination until Georgia was finally <a href="Georgia_within_the_Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">annexed by the Russian Empire</a> in 1801. After a brief bid for independence with the <a href="Democratic_Republic_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">Democratic Republic of Georgia</a> of 1918&lt;U+2013&gt;1921, Georgia was part of the <a href="Transcaucasian_Socialist_Federative_Soviet_Republic" title="wikilink">Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic</a> from 1922 to 1936, and then formed the <a href="Georgian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic" title="wikilink">Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> until the dissolution of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The current <a href="Republic_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">Republic of Georgia</a> has been independent since 1991. The first president <a href="Zviad_Gamsakhurdia" title="wikilink">Zviad Gamsakhurdia</a> stoked Georgian nationalism and vowed to assert Tbilisi's authority over <a href="Abkhazia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Abkhazia</a> and <a href="South_Ossetia" title="wikilink">South Ossetia</a>. Gamsakhurdia was deposed in a bloody coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat within the year and the country became embroiled in a bitter <a href="Georgian_Civil_War" title="wikilink">civil war</a>, which lasted until 1995. Supported by Russia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia achieved <em>de facto</em> independence from Georgia. The <a href="Rose_Revolution" title="wikilink">Rose Revolution</a> forced <a href="Eduard_Shevardnadze" title="wikilink">Eduard Shevardnadze</a> to resign in 2003. The new government under <a href="Mikheil_Saakashvili" title="wikilink">Mikheil Saakashvili</a> prevented the secession of a third breakaway republic in the <a href="Ajaria_Crisis" title="wikilink">Ajaria Crisis</a> of 2004, but the conflict with Abkhazia and South Ossetia led to the <a href="2008_South_Ossetia_war" title="wikilink">2008 Russo-Georgian War</a> and <a href="2008&lt;U+2013&gt;2010_Georgia&lt;U+2013&gt;Russia_crisis" title="wikilink">tensions with Russia</a> remain unresolved.</p>

At the same period, the ethnic unity of Proto-Kartvelians broke up into several branches, among them Svans, <a href="Zan_language" title="wikilink">Zans</a>/Chans and East-Kartvelians. That finally led to the formation of modern <a href="Kartvelian_languages" title="wikilink">Kartvelian languages</a>: Georgian (originating from East Kartvelian vernaculars), Svan, <a href="Megrelian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Megrelian</a> and <a href="Laz_language" title="wikilink">Laz</a> (the latter two originating from Zan dialects).

As a result of cultural and geographic delimitation, two core areas of future Georgian culture and statehood formed in western and eastern Georgia by the end of the 8th century BC.

<p>According to the scholar of the Caucasian studies <a href="Cyril_Toumanoff" title="wikilink">Cyril Toumanoff</a>:</p>

<p>The <a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">ancient Greeks</a> knew of Colchis, and it featured in the Greek legend of <a href="Jason" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jason</a> and the <a href="Argonauts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Argonauts</a>, who travelled there in search of the <a href="Golden_Fleece" title="wikilink">Golden Fleece</a>. Starting around 2000 BC, northwestern Colchis was inhabited by the <a href="Svan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Svan</a> and <a href="Zan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zan</a> peoples of the Kartvelian tribes. Another important ethnic element of ancient Colchis were Greeks who between 1000 and 550 BC established many trading colonies in the coastal area, among them <a href="Naessus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Naessus</a>, <a href="Pitiys" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pitiys</a>, <a href="Dioscurias" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dioscurias</a>, <a href="Guenos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guenos</a>, <a href="Phasis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phasis</a> (modern Poti), <a href="Apsaros" class="uri" title="wikilink">Apsaros</a>, and <a href="Rhizos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rhizos</a> (modern Rize in Turkey). In the eastern part of Georgia there was a struggle for the leadership among the various Georgian confederations during the 6th&lt;U+2013&gt;4th centuries BC, which was finally won by the Kartlian tribes from the region of Mtskheta. According to the Georgian tradition, the Kingdom of Kartli (known as <a href="Caucasian_Iberia" title="wikilink">Iberia</a> in the Greek-Roman literature) was founded around 300 BC by <a href="Pharnavaz_I_of_Iberia" title="wikilink">Parnavaz I</a>, the first ruler of the <a href="Parnavazian" title="wikilink">Parnavazid dynasty</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Between 653 and 333 BC, both Colchis and Iberia survived successive invasions by the <a href="Median_Empire" title="wikilink">Median Empire</a>, and later the <a href="Persian_Empire" title="wikilink">Persian Empire</a>. At the end of the 3rd century BC southern <a href="Caucasian_Iberia" title="wikilink">Iberia</a> witnessed the invading armies of <a href="Alexander_the_Great" title="wikilink">Alexander the Great</a>, who established a vast Greco-Macedonian empire to the south of the Caucasus. Neither Iberia nor Colchis was incorporated into the empire of Alexander or any of the successor Hellenistic states of the Middle East. However, the culture of ancient Greece still had a considerable influence on the region, and Greek was widely spoken in the cities of Colchis. In Iberia Greek influence was less noticeable and <a href="Aramaic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aramaic</a> was widely spoken.</p>
<p>Between the early 2nd century BC and the late 2nd century AD both Colchis and Iberia, together with the neighboring countries, became an arena of long and devastating conflicts between major and local powers such as <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Rome</a>, <a href="Armenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Armenia</a> and the short-lived Kingdom of <a href="Pontus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pontus</a>. In 189 BC, the rapidly growing <a href="Kingdom_of_Armenia_(antiquity)" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Armenia</a> took over more than half of Iberia, conquering the southern and southeastern provinces of <a href="Gogarene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gogarene</a>, <a href="Tao-Klarjeti" title="wikilink">Taokhia</a> and <a href="Genyokhia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Genyokhia</a>, as well as some other territories. Between 120 and 63 BC, Armenia's ally <a href="Mithridates_VI_of_Pontus" title="wikilink">Mithridate VI Eupator</a> of Pontus conquered all of Colchis and incorporated it into his kingdom, embracing almost all of Asia Minor as well as the eastern and northern Black Sea coastal areas.</p>

<p>This close association with Armenia brought upon the country <a href="Pompey&#39;s_Georgian_campaign" title="wikilink">an invasion</a> (65 BC) by the Roman general <a href="Pompey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pompey</a>, who was then at war with <a href="Mithradates_VI_of_Pontus" title="wikilink">Mithradates VI of Pontus</a>, and Armenia; but Rome did not establish her power permanently over Iberia. Nineteen years later, the Romans again marched (36 BC) on Iberia forcing King <a href="Pharnavaz_II_of_Iberia" title="wikilink">Pharnavaz II</a> to join their campaign against <a href="Caucasian_Albania" title="wikilink">Albania</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> <img src="Ashotkurapalatgeorgia.jpg" title="fig:Ashot Kurapalates, first Bagrationi King of Georgia, 829 AD" alt="Ashot Kurapalates, first Bagrationi King of Georgia, 829 AD" width="200" /> During this time Armenia and Pontus were actively expanding at the expense of Rome, taking over its Eastern Mediterranean possessions. However, the success of the anti-Roman alliance did not last long. As a result of the brilliant Roman campaigns of Pompey and <a href="Lucullus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lucullus</a> from the west, and the <a href="Parthia" title="wikilink">Parthian</a> invasion from the south, Armenia lost a significant part of its conquests by 65 BC, devolving into a Roman-Parthian dependency. At the same time, the <a href="Kingdom_of_Pontus" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Pontus</a> was completely destroyed by the Romans and all its territory including Colchis were incorporated into the <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Roman Empire</a> as her provinces.</p>
<p>The former Kingdom of Colchis became the Roman province of <a href="Egrisi" title="wikilink">Lazicum</a> ruled by Roman <a href="Legatus" title="wikilink">legati</a>. The following 600 years of Georgian history were marked by struggle between Rome and Persia (Iran) including <a href="Parthia" title="wikilink">Parthians</a> and <a href="Sassanids" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sassanids</a> who were fighting long wars against each other for the domination in the Middle East including Syria, Mesopotamia, Armenia, <a href="Caucasian_Albania" title="wikilink">Albania</a>, and Iberia.</p>
<p>While the Georgian kingdom of Colchis was administered as a Roman province, <a href="Caucasian_Iberia" title="wikilink">Caucasian Iberia</a> freely accepted the Roman Imperial protection. A stone inscription discovered at <a href="Mtskheta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mtskheta</a> speaks of the 1st-century ruler Mihdrat I (AD 58&lt;U+2013&gt;106) as &quot;the friend of the Caesars&quot; and the king &quot;of the Roman-loving Iberians.&quot; Emperor <a href="Vespasian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vespasian</a> fortified the ancient Mtskheta site of Arzami for the Iberian kings in 75 AD.</p>
<p>In the 2nd century AD, Iberia strengthened her position in the area, especially during the reign of King <a href="Pharsman_II" title="wikilink">Pharsman II</a> who achieved full independence from Rome and reconquered some of the previously lost territories from declining Armenia. In the early 3rd century, Rome had to give up Albania and most of Armenia to <a href="Sassanid_Empire" title="wikilink">Sassanid Persia</a>. The province of Lazicum was given a degree of autonomy that by the end of the century developed into full independence with the formation of a new Kingdom of Lazica-Egrisi on the territories of smaller principalities of the Zans, Svans, Apsyls, and Sanyghs. This new Western Georgian state survived more than 250 years until 562 when it was absorbed by the <a href="Byzantine_Empire" title="wikilink">Byzantine Empire</a>.</p>
<p>In the 3rd century <a href="Common_Era" title="wikilink">AD</a>, the <a href="Lazi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lazi</a> tribe came to dominate most of Colchis, establishing the kingdom of <a href="Lazica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lazica</a>, locally known as Egrisi. Colchis was a scene of the protracted rivalry between the <a href="Eastern_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Eastern Roman</a>/<a href="Byzantine_empire" title="wikilink">Byzantine</a> and <a href="Sassanid_dynasty" title="wikilink">Sassanid</a> empires, culminating in the <a href="Lazic_War" title="wikilink">Lazic War</a> from 542 to 562.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

At the end of the 5th century though, Prince <a href="Vakhtang_I_Gorgasali" title="wikilink">Vakhtang I Gorgasali</a> orchestrated an anti-Persian uprising and restored Iberian statehood, proclaiming himself the King. After this, the armies of Vakhtang launched several campaigns against both Persia and the <a href="Byzantine_Empire" title="wikilink">Byzantine Empire</a>. However, his struggle for the independence and unity of the Georgian state did not have lasting success. After Vakhtang's death in 502, and the short reign of his son <a href="Dachi_of_Iberia" title="wikilink">Dachi</a> (502&lt;U+2013&gt;514), Iberia was reincorporated into Persia as a province once again. However this time the Iberian nobility were granted the privilege of electing the governors, who in Georgian were called <em>erismtavari</em>. By the late 7th century, the Byzantine-Persian rivalry for the Middle East had given way to Arab conquest of the region and <a href="Marwan_ibn_Muhammad&#39;s_invasion_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">subsequent invasions</a> to ensure <a href="Arab_rule_in_Georgia" title="wikilink">Arab hegemony</a> in the Caucasus.</p>

In 1001 Bagrat added Tao-Klarjeti (Curopalatinate of Iberia) to his domain as a result of David's death. In 1008&lt;U+2013&gt;1010, Bagrat annexed <a href="Kakheti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kakheti</a> and Ereti, thus becoming the first king of a united Georgia in both the east and west.</p>
<p>The second half of the 11th century was marked by the strategically significant invasion of the <a href="Seljuq_dynasty" title="wikilink">Seljuq Turks</a>, who by the end of the 1040s had succeeded in building a vast nomadic empire including most of Central Asia and Persia. In 1071, the Seljuq army destroyed the united Byzantine-Armenian and Georgian forces in the <a href="Battle_of_Manzikert" title="wikilink">Battle of Manzikert</a>. By 1081, all of Armenia, <a href="Anatolia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anatolia</a>, <a href="Mesopotamia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mesopotamia</a>, <a href="Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syria</a>, and most of Georgia had been conquered and devastated by the Seljuqs in the <a href="Great_Turkish_Invasion" title="wikilink">Great Turkish Invasion</a>. In Georgia, only the mountainous areas of <a href="Abkhazia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Abkhazia</a>, <a href="Svaneti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Svaneti</a>, <a href="Racha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Racha</a>, and <a href="Khevi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khevi</a>–<a href="Khevsureti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khevsureti</a> remained out of Seljuq control and served as a relatively safe havens for numerous refugees. The rest of the country was dominated by the conquerors who destroyed the cities and fortresses, looted the villages, and massacred both the aristocracy and the farming population. In fact, by the end of the 1080s, Georgians were outnumbered in the region by the invaders.</p>

<p><img src="King_David_Aghmashenebeli.jpg" title="fig:King David the Builder, Shio-Mghvime monastery" alt="King David the Builder, Shio-Mghvime monastery" width="200" /> The struggle against the <a href="Seljuq_dynasty" title="wikilink">Seljuq</a> invaders in Georgia was led by the young <a href="David_IV_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">King David IV</a> of the Bagrationi royal family, who inherited the throne in 1089 at the age of 16 after the abdication of his father George II Bagrationi. Soon after coming to power, David created the regular army and peasant militia in order to be able to resist Seljuq colonization of his country. The First Crusade (1096&lt;U+2013&gt;1099) and the Crusaders' offensive against the Seljuq Turks in Anatolia and Syria favored David's successful campaigns in Georgia. By the end of 1099 David had stopped paying tribute to the Seljuqs and had liberated most of the Georgian lands, with the exception of <a href="Tbilisi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tbilisi</a> and <a href="Hereti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hereti</a>. In 1103 he reorganized the <a href="Georgian_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Georgian Orthodox Church</a> and closely linked it with the state by appointing as <a href="Catholicos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Catholicos</a> (Archbishop) a Crown Chancellor (Mtsihnobart Ukhutsesi) of Georgia. In 1103&lt;U+2013&gt;1105 the Georgian army took over Hereti and made successful raids into still Seljuq-controlled <a href="Shirvan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shirvan</a>. Between 1110 and 1118 David took Lori, Samshvilde, Rustavi and other fortresses of lower Kartli and Tashiri, thus turning Tbilisi into an isolated Seljuq enclave. <img src="KingDavidtheBuilderFlag.svg" title="fig:Flag of Georgia during the reign of David the Builder" alt="Flag of Georgia during the reign of David the Builder" width="150" /> In 1118&lt;U+2013&gt;1119, having considerable amounts of free, unsettled land as a result of the withdrawal of Turkish nomads, and desperately needing qualified manpower for the army, King David invited some 40,000 <a href="Kipchak_people" title="wikilink">Kipchak</a> warriors from <a href="North_Caucasus" title="wikilink">North Caucasus</a> to settle in Georgia with their families. In 1120 the ruler of Alania recognized himself as King David's vassal and afterwards sent thousands of Alans (allegedly modern day Ossetians) to cross the main Caucasus range into Georgia, where they settled in Kartli. The Georgian Royal army also welcomed mercenaries from Germany, Italy, and Scandinavia (all those westerners were defined in Georgia as &quot;the Franks&quot;) as well as from Kievan Rus. <img src="Queentamar_giorgi.jpg" title="fig:Queen Tamar and her father King George III (restored fresco from the Betania monastery)" alt="Queen Tamar and her father King George III (restored fresco from the Betania monastery)" width="300" /> In 1121, the Seljuq Sultan Mahmud declared <a href="Jihad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jihad</a> on Georgia and sent a strong army under one of his famous generals <a href="Ilghazi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ilghazi</a> to fight the Georgians. Although significantly outnumbered by the Turks, the Georgians managed to defeat the invaders at the <a href="Battle_of_Didgori" title="wikilink">Battle of Didgori</a>, and in 1122 they took over Tbilisi, making it Georgia's capital. Three years later the Georgians conquered Shirvan. As a result, the mostly Christian-populated <a href="Ghishi-Kabala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ghishi-Kabala</a> area in western Shirvan (a relic of the once prosperous Albanian Kingdom) was annexed by Georgia while the rest of already Islamicized Shirvan became Georgia's client-state. In the same year a large portion of Armenia was liberated by David's troops and fell into Georgian hands as well. Thus in 1124 David also became the King of Armenians, incorporating Northern Armenia into the lands of the Georgian Crown. In 1125 King David died, leaving Georgia with the status of a strong regional power. In Georgia, King David is called Agmashenebeli (English: the builder).</p>
<p>David Agmashenebeli's successors (Kings Demeter I, David V and George III) continued the policy of Georgia's expansion by subordinating most of the mountain clans and tribes of North Caucasia and further securing Georgian positions in Shirvan. However, the most glorious sovereign of Georgia of that period was definitely Queen Tamar (David's great-granddaughter).</p>
<h3 id="queen-tamar-the-great-and-the-golden-age-1184u20131213">Queen Tamar the Great and the Golden Age 1184&lt;U+2013&gt;1213</h3>
<p><img src="Queen_Tamara_of_Georgia.jpg" title="fig:Queen Tamar of Georgia, titled as &quot;Mepe&quot; (King)." alt="Queen Tamar of Georgia, titled as &quot;Mepe&quot; (King)." /> The reign of <a href="Tamar_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">Queen Tamar</a> represented the peak of Georgia's might in the whole history of the nation. In 1194&lt;U+2013&gt;1204, Tamar's armies crushed new Turkish invasions from the south-east and south and launched several successful campaigns into Turkish-controlled Southern Armenia. As a result, most of Southern Armenia, including the cities of <a href="Erzurum" title="wikilink">Karin</a>, <a href="Erzinjan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Erzinjan</a>, <a href="Ahlat" title="wikilink">Khelat</a>, <a href="Mu&lt;U+015F&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mu&lt;U+015F&gt;</a> and <a href="Van,_Turkey" title="wikilink">Van</a>, came under Georgian control. Although it was not included in the lands of the Georgian Crown, and was left under the nominal rule of local Turkish Emirs and Sultans, Southern Armenia became a protectorate of the Kingdom of Georgia. <img src="Geor_tamro_aandersen.GIF" title="fig:Kingdom of Georgia at peak of its military dominance, 1184&lt;U+2013&gt;1225" alt="Kingdom of Georgia at peak of its military dominance, 1184&lt;U+2013&gt;1225" width="250" /> The temporary fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1204 to the Crusaders left Georgia and Bulgarian Empire as the strongest Christian states in the whole East Mediterranean area. The same year Queen Tamar sent her troops to take over the former Byzantine Lazona and Paryadria with the cities of Atina, <a href="Rize" title="wikilink">Riza</a>, <a href="Trebizond" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trebizond</a>, <a href="Kerasunt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kerasunt</a>, <a href="Samsun" title="wikilink">Amysos</a>, <a href="Cotyora" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cotyora</a>, <a href="Heraclea_Pontica" title="wikilink">Heraclea</a> and <a href="Sinop,_Turkey" title="wikilink">Sinopa</a>. In 1205, the occupied territory was transformed into the <a href="Empire_of_Trebizond" title="wikilink">Empire of Trebizond</a>, which was dependent on Georgia. Tamar's relative Prince <a href="Alexios_I_of_Trebizond" title="wikilink">Alexios Komnenos</a> was crowned as its Emperor. In 1210 Georgian armies invaded northern Persia (modern day Iranian Azerbaijan) and took the cities of <a href="Marand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marand</a>, <a href="Tabriz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tabriz</a>, <a href="Ardabil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ardabil</a>, <a href="Zanjan_(city)" title="wikilink">Zanjan</a> and <a href="Qazvin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qazvin</a>, placing part of the conquered territory under a Georgian protectorate. This was the maximum territorial extent of Georgia throughout her history. Queen Tamar was addressed as &quot;The Queen of Abkhazians, Kartvels, Rans, Kakhs and Armenians, Shirvan-Shakhine and Shakh-in-Shakhine, The Sovereign of the East and West&quot;. Georgian historians often refer to her as &quot;Queen Tamar the Great&quot;.</p>
<p>The period between the early 12th and the early 13th centuries, and especially the era of Tamar the Great, can truly be considered as the golden age of Georgia. Besides the political and military achievements, it was marked by the development of Georgian culture, including architecture, literature, philosophy and sciences.</p>
<h3 id="mongol-invasion-and-decline-of-the-georgian-kingdom">Mongol invasion and decline of the Georgian Kingdom</h3>

<p><img src="KingLuarsab.jpg" title="fig:King Martyr Luarsab II of Kartli." alt="King Martyr Luarsab II of Kartli." width="200" /> In the 1220s, the South Caucasus and <a href="Asia_Minor" title="wikilink">Asia Minor</a> faced the invasion of the <a href="Mongols" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mongols</a>. In spite of fierce resistance by Georgian-Armenian forces and their allies, the whole area including most of Georgia, all Armenian lands and Central Anatolia eventually fell to the Mongols.</p>
<p>In 1243, Queen <a href="Rusudan_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">Rusudan of Georgia</a> signed a peace treaty with the Mongols in accordance with which Georgia lost her client-states, ceded western Shirvan, <a href="Nakhichevan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nakhichevan</a> and some other territories and agreed to pay tribute to the Mongols as well as to let them occupy and de-facto rule more than half of the remaining territory. Although Mongol-occupied Tbilisi remained an official capital of the kingdom, the Queen refused to return there and stayed in <a href="Kutaisi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kutaisi</a> until her death in 1245. In addition to all the above hardships, even the part of the kingdom that remained free of the Mongols started disintegrating: The Crown started losing control over the warlords of <a href="Samtskhe-Javakheti" title="wikilink">Samtskhe</a> (southern provinces of Georgia) who established their own relations with the Mongols and by the year 1266 practically seceded from Georgia.</p>
<p>The period between 1259 and 1330 was marked by the struggle of the Georgians against the Mongol <a href="Ilkhanate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ilkhanate</a> for full independence. The first anti-Mongol uprising started in 1259 under the leadership of <a href="David_VI_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">King David Narin</a> who in fact waged his war for almost thirty years. The Anti-Mongol strife went on under the Kings Demeter II (1270&lt;U+2013&gt;1289) and David VIII (1293&lt;U+2013&gt;1311). Finally, it was <a href="George_V_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">King George the Brilliant</a> (1314&lt;U+2013&gt;1346) who managed to play on the decline of the Ilkhanate, stopped paying tribute to the Mongols, restored the pre-1220 state borders of Georgia, and returned the <a href="Empire_of_Trebizond" title="wikilink">Empire of Trebizond</a> into Georgia's sphere of influence.</p>
<p>In 1386&lt;U+2013&gt;1403, the Kingdom of Georgia faced eight Turco-Mongolic invasions under the leadership of <a href="Tamerlane" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tamerlane</a>. Except in <a href="Abkhazia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Abkhazia</a> and <a href="Svaneti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Svaneti</a>, the invasions devastated Georgia's economy, population, and urban centers.</p>

<p><img src="Caucasus_1460_map_de_alt.svg" title="fig:Georgian Kingdom just before fragmentation, 1460" alt="Georgian Kingdom just before fragmentation, 1460" width="300" /> In 15th century the whole area changed dramatically in all possible aspects: linguistic, cultural, political, etc. During that period the Kingdom of Georgia turned into an isolated, fractured Christian enclave, a relic of the faded East Roman epoch surrounded by Muslim, predominantly Turco-Iranian-Arabic world.</p>
<p>By the middle of the 15th century, most of Georgia's old neighbor-states disappeared from the map within less than a hundred years. The <a href="fall_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">fall of Constantinople</a> to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 sealed the Black Sea and cut the remnants of Christian states of the area from Europe and the rest of the Christian world. Georgia remained connected to the West through contact with the <a href="Republic_of_Genoa" title="wikilink">Genoese</a> colonies of the <a href="Crimea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crimea</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of these changes, the Georgian Kingdom suffered economic and political decline and in the 1460s the kingdom fractured into several kingdoms and principalities:<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p>By the late 15th century the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a> was encroaching on the Georgian states from the west and in 1501 a new Muslim power, <a href="Safavid_dynasty" title="wikilink">Safavid Persia</a>, arose to the east. For the next few centuries, Georgia would become a battleground between these two great rival powers and the Georgian states would struggle to maintain their independence. In 1555, the Ottomans and the Safavids signed the Peace of Amasya, defining spheres of influence in Georgia, assigning Imereti in the west to the Turks and Kartli-Kakheti in the east to the Persians. The treaty however, was not in force for long as the Ottomans gained the upper hand and <a href="Lala_Mustafa_Pasha&#39;s_Caucasian_campaign" title="wikilink">launched campaigns</a> threatening to end the Persian domination in the region. They were repelled soon enough but not without some permanent losses on the Safavid side. As the Georgian rulers were against both Ottoman and Safavid control of their Kingdoms, they were forced to maneuver their way through and attempting to bring these two powers into conflict. In the end, Georgian rulers were forced to submit to the one conqueror or the other, considering Geographic proximity, but never fully surrendering to either. After the Ottoman failure to gain permanent foothold in the eastern Caucasus, Iranians immediately sought to strengthen their position and finally subject the rebellious Kingdoms of the Eastern Georgia.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> <a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> <a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The campaigns of the most powerful Safavid ruler, <a href="Shah_Abbas_I" title="wikilink">Shah Abbas</a>, to bring eastern Georgia under his sway were particularly devastating. Tens of thousands of Georgians were killed or deported to Persia and the shah had the queen mother, <a href="Ketevan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ketevan</a>, tortured to death.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> By the 17th century, both eastern and western Georgia had sunk into poverty as the result of the constant warfare. The economy was so bad that barter replaced the use of money and the populations of the cities declined markedly. The French traveller <a href="Jean_Chardin" title="wikilink">Jean Chardin</a>, who visited the region of <a href="Mingrelia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mingrelia</a> in 1671, noted the wretchedness of the peasants, the arrogance of the nobles and the ignorance of the clergy.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The rulers were split between acknowledging Ottoman or Persian overlordship (which often entailed nominal conversion to Islam) or making a bid for independence.

<p><img src="Solomon_I_of_Imereti.gif" title="fig:King Solomon I of Imereti." alt="King Solomon I of Imereti." width="180" /> In the early 18th century, Kartli saw a partial recovery under <a href="Vakhtang_VI" title="wikilink">Vakhtang VI</a>, who instituted a new law code and tried to improve the economy. His reign saw the establishment of the first Georgian-language printing press in 1709.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Erekle_II" title="wikilink">Erekle II</a>, king of <a href="Kartli-Kakheti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kartli-Kakheti</a> from 1762 to 1798, turned towards Russia for protection against Ottoman and Persian attacks. The Russian empress <a href="Catherine_the_Great" title="wikilink">Catherine the Great</a> was keen to have the Georgians as allies in her wars against the Turks, but sent only meagre forces to help them.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> In 1769–1772, a handful of Russian troops under General Totleben &quot;battled&quot; against Turkish invaders in Imereti and Kartl-Kakheti. The Russian troops retreated before a clash against the Turks. In 1783 Erekle signed the <a href="Treaty_of_Georgievsk" title="wikilink">Treaty of Georgievsk</a> with Russia, according to which Kartli-Kakheti was to receive Russian protection. But when another Russo-Turkish War broke out in 1787, the Russians withdrew their troops from the region for use elsewhere, leaving Erekle's kingdom unprotected. In 1795, the Persian shah, <a href="Agha_Mohammed_Khan" title="wikilink">Agha Mohammed Khan</a>, invaded the country and burnt the capital, Tbilisi, to the ground.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Eraclio_II_re_di_Georgia_ii.jpg" title="fig:King Erekle II of Kartli and Kakheti." alt="King Erekle II of Kartli and Kakheti." width="170" /> In spite of Russia's failure to honour the terms of the Treaty of Georgievsk, Georgian rulers felt they had nobody else to turn to. After Erekle's death, a civil war broke out over the succession to the throne of Kartli-Kakheti and one of the rival candidates called on Russia to intervene and decide matters. On January 8, 1801, Tsar <a href="Paul_I_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Paul I of Russia</a> signed a decree on the incorporation of Georgia (Kingdom of <a href="Kartli-Kakheti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kartli-Kakheti</a>) within the Russian Empire,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> which was confirmed by Tsar <a href="Alexander_I_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Alexander I</a> on September 12, 1801.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The Georgian envoy in Saint Petersburg, <a href="Garsevan_Chavchavadze" title="wikilink">Garsevan Chavchavadze</a>, reacted with a note of protest that was presented to the Russian vice-chancellor <a href="Alexander_Kurakin" title="wikilink">Alexander Kurakin</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> In May 1801 Russian General Carl Heinrich Knorring dethroned the Georgian heir to the throne David <a href="Batonishvili" class="uri" title="wikilink">Batonishvili</a> and deployed a government headed by General Ivan Petrovich Lasarev.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>A part of the Georgian nobility did not accept the decree until April 1802 when General Knorring compassed the nobility in Tbilisi's Sioni Cathedral and forced them to take an oath on the imperial crown of Russia.

<p>In the summer of 1805 Russian troops on the river Askerani and near Zagam defeated the Persian army, saving Tbilisi from its attack. In 1810, the kingdom of <a href="Imereti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Imereti</a> (Western Georgia) was annexed by the <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russian Empire</a> after the suppression of King <a href="Solomon_II_of_Imereti" title="wikilink">Solomon II</a>'s resistance.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> From 1803 to 1878, as a result of numerous Russian wars against Turkey and Persia, several formerly Georgian territories were annexed to the Russian Empire.

<h2 id="russian-rule">Russian rule</h2>

<p><img src="19th_century_Georgian_(Europe)_nobility.png" title="fig:19th century Georgian Noble Family." alt="19th century Georgian Noble Family." /> Russian and Georgian society had much in common: the main religion was Orthodox Christianity and in both countries a land-owning aristocracy ruled over a population of serfs. The Russian authorities aimed to integrate Georgia into the rest of their empire, but at first Russian rule proved high-handed, arbitrary and insensitive to local law and customs, leading to a conspiracy by Georgian nobles in 1832 and a revolt by <a href="1841_rebellion_in_Guria" title="wikilink">peasants and nobles in Guria</a> in 1841.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Things changed with the appointment of <a href="Mikhail_Vorontsov" title="wikilink">Mikhail Vorontsov</a> as <a href="Viceroyalty_of_the_Caucasus" title="wikilink">Viceroy of the Caucasus</a> in 1845. Count Vorontsov's new policies successfully won over the Georgian nobility, who became increasingly eager to abandon Islamic influences that had been forced upon Georgia in the preceding centuries and pursued, after the example of Russian nobility, a long-sought process of Europeanisation. Life for Georgian serfs was very different, however, since the rural economy remained seriously depressed. Georgian serfs lived in dire poverty, subject to the frequent threat of starvation. Few of them lived in the towns, where what little trade and industry there was, was in the hands of Armenians, whose ancestors had migrated to Georgia in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Serfdom was abolished in Russian lands in 1861. The tsar also wanted to emancipate the serfs of Georgia, but without losing the loyalty of the nobility whose revenues depended on peasant labour. This called for delicate negotiations before serfdom was gradually phased out in the Georgian provinces from 1864 onwards.</p>
<h3 id="the-growth-of-the-georgian-national-movement">The growth of the Georgian national movement</h3>

The poverty of the serfs had not been alleviated while the nobles had lost some of their privileges. The nobles in particular also felt threatened by the growing power of the urban, Armenian middle class in Georgia, who prospered as <a href="capitalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">capitalism</a> came to the region. Georgian dissatisfaction with <a href="Tsarist_autocracy" title="wikilink">Tsarist autocracy</a> and Armenian economic domination <a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> led to the development of a national liberation movement in the second half of the 19th century.</p>
<p>A large-scale peasant revolt occurred in 1905, which led to political reforms that eased the tensions for a period. During this time, the Marxist <a href="Russian_Social_Democratic_Labour_Party" title="wikilink">Social Democratic Party</a> became the dominant political movement in Georgia, being elected to all the Georgian seats in the Russian <a href="State_Duma" title="wikilink">State Duma</a> established after 1905. Josef Vissarionovich Djugashvili (more famously known as <a href="Joseph_Stalin" title="wikilink">Joseph Stalin</a>), a Georgian <a href="Bolshevik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bolshevik</a>, became a leader of the revolutionary (and anti-<a href="Menshevik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Menshevik</a>) movement in Georgia. He went on to control the Soviet Union. <img src="AkakiTsereteli.jpg" title="fig:Prince Akaki Tsereteli, prominent Georgian poet and national liberation movement figure." alt="Prince Akaki Tsereteli, prominent Georgian poet and national liberation movement figure." width="200" /> Many Georgians were upset by the loss of independence of the Georgian Orthodox Church. The Russian clergy took control of Georgian churches and monasteries, prohibiting use of the Georgian liturgy and desecrating medieval Georgian frescos on various churches all across Georgia.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>Between the years of 1855 to 1907, the Georgian patriotic movement was launched under the leadership of Prince <a href="Ilia_Chavchavadze" title="wikilink">Ilia Chavchavadze</a>, world-renowned poet, novelist and orator. Chavchavadze financed new Georgian schools and supported the Georgian national theatre. In 1877 he launched the newspaper <em><a href="Iveria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iveria</a></em>, which played an important part in reviving Georgian national consciousness. His struggle for national awakening was welcomed by the leading Georgian intellectuals of that time such as <a href="Giorgi_Tsereteli" title="wikilink">Giorgi Tsereteli</a>, <a href="Ivane_Machabeli" title="wikilink">Ivane Machabeli</a>, <a href="Akaki_Tsereteli" title="wikilink">Akaki Tsereteli</a>, <a href="Niko_Nikoladze" title="wikilink">Niko Nikoladze</a>, <a href="Alexander_Kazbegi" title="wikilink">Alexander Kazbegi</a> and <a href="Iakob_Gogebashvili" title="wikilink">Iakob Gogebashvili</a>.</p>
<p>The Georgian intelligentsia's support for Prince Chavchavadze and Georgian independence is shown in this declaration:</p>

<p>The last decades of the 19th century witnessed a Georgian literary revival in which writers emerged of a stature unequalled since the Golden Age of <a href="Shota_Rustaveli" title="wikilink">Rustaveli</a> seven hundred years before. Ilia Chavchavadze himself excelled alike in lyric and ballad poetry, in the novel, the short story and the essay. Apart from Chavchavadze, the most universal literary genius of the age was <a href="Akaki_Tsereteli" title="wikilink">Akaki Tsereteli</a>, known as &quot;the immortal nightingale of the Georgian people.&quot; Along with Niko Nikoladze and Iakob Gogebashvili, these literary figures contributed significantly to the national cultural revival and were therefore known as the founding fathers of modern Georgia.</p>

The Soviet Government forced Georgia to cede several areas to Turkey (the province of <a href="Tao-Klarjeti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tao-Klarjeti</a> and part of <a href="Batumi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Batumi</a> province), <a href="Azerbaijan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azerbaijan</a> (the province of <a href="Hereti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hereti</a>/<a href="Saingilo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saingilo</a>), <a href="Armenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Armenia</a> (the <a href="Lori_Province" title="wikilink">Lore</a> region) and Russia (northeastern corner of <a href="Khevi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khevi</a>, eastern Georgia). Soviet rule was harsh: about 50,000 people were executed and killed in 1921–1924, more than 150,000 were purged under Stalin and his secret police chief, the Georgian <a href="Lavrenty_Beria" title="wikilink">Lavrenty Beria</a> in 1935–1938, 1942 and 1945–1951. In 1936, the TFSSR was dissolved and Georgia became the <a href="Georgian_SSR" title="wikilink">Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic</a>.</p>
<p>Reaching the <a href="Caucasus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caucasus</a> oilfields was one of the main objectives of <a href="Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Adolf Hitler</a>'s <a href="Operation_Barbarossa" title="wikilink">invasion of the USSR</a> in June 1941, but the armies of the <a href="Axis_powers" title="wikilink">Axis powers</a> did not get as far as Georgia. The country contributed almost 700,000 fighters (350,000 were killed) to the Red Army, and was a vital source of textiles and munitions. However, a number of Georgians fought on the side of the German armed forces, forming the <a href="Georgian_Legion_(1941&lt;U+2013&gt;1945)" title="wikilink">Georgian Legion</a>.</p>
<p>During this period Stalin ordered the deportation of the <a href="Chechen_people" title="wikilink">Chechen</a>, <a href="Ingush_people" title="wikilink">Ingush</a>, <a href="Karachay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Karachay</a> and the <a href="Balkarian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Balkarian</a> peoples from the Northern <a href="Caucasus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caucasus</a>; they were <a href="Population_transfer_in_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">transported</a> to <a href="Siberia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Siberia</a> and <a href="Central_Asia" title="wikilink">Central Asia</a> for alleged collaboration with the <a href="Nazism" title="wikilink">Nazis</a>. He abolished their respective autonomous republics. The <a href="Georgian_SSR" title="wikilink">Georgian SSR</a> was briefly granted some of their territory until 1957.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>Stalin's successful appeal for patriotic unity eclipsed Georgian nationalism during the war and diffused it in the years following. On March 9, 1956, <a href="March_9_Massacre_in_Tbilisi,_1956" title="wikilink">about a hundred Georgian students were killed</a> when they demonstrated against <a href="Nikita_Khrushchev" title="wikilink">Nikita Khrushchev</a>'s policy of de-Stalinization.</p>
<p>The decentralisation program introduced by Khrushchev in the mid-1950s was soon exploited by Georgian <a href="Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Communist Party</a> officials to build their own regional power base. A thriving pseudo-capitalist shadow economy emerged alongside the official state-owned economy. While the official growth rate of the economy of the Georgia was among the lowest in the USSR, such indicators as savings level, rates of car and house ownership were the highest in the Union,<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> making Georgia one of the most economically successful Soviet republics. Corruption was at a high level. Among all the union republics, Georgia had the highest number of residents with high or special secondary education.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Although corruption was hardly unknown in the Soviet Union, it became so widespread and blatant in Georgia that it came to be an embarrassment to the authorities in Moscow. <a href="Eduard_Shevardnadze" title="wikilink">Eduard Shevardnadze</a>, the country's interior minister between 1964 and 1972, gained a reputation as a fighter of corruption and engineered the removal of <a href="Vasil_Mzhavanadze" title="wikilink">Vasil Mzhavanadze</a>, the corrupt First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party. Shevardnadze ascended to the post of First Secretary with the blessings of Moscow. He was an effective and able ruler of Georgia from 1972 to 1985, improving the official economy and dismissing hundreds of corrupt officials. <img src="April9victims.jpg" title="fig:Photos of the April 9, 1989 Massacre victims (mostly young women) on billboard in Tbilisi" alt="Photos of the April 9, 1989 Massacre victims (mostly young women) on billboard in Tbilisi" width="250" /> Soviet power and Georgian nationalism clashed in 1978 when Moscow ordered revision of the constitutional status of the Georgian language as Georgia's official state language. Bowing to pressure from <a href="1978_Tbilisi_Demonstrations" title="wikilink">mass street demonstrations</a> on April 14, 1978, Moscow approved Shevardnadze's reinstatement of the constitutional guarantee the same year. April 14 was established as a Day of the Georgian Language.</p>
<p>Shevardnadze's appointment as Soviet Foreign Minister in 1985 brought his replacement in Georgia by <a href="Jumber_Patiashvili" title="wikilink">Jumber Patiashvili</a>, a conservative and generally ineffective Communist who coped poorly with the challenges of <a href="perestroika" class="uri" title="wikilink">perestroika</a>. Towards the end of the late 1980s, increasingly violent clashes occurred between the Communist authorities, the resurgent Georgian nationalist movement and nationalist movements in Georgia's minority-populated regions (notably <a href="South_Ossetian_Autonomous_Oblast" title="wikilink">South Ossetia</a>). On April 9, 1989, Soviet troops were used to break up a peaceful demonstration at the government building in Tbilisi. Twenty Georgians were killed and hundreds wounded and poisoned. The event radicalised Georgian politics, prompting many&lt;U+2014&gt;even some Georgian communists&lt;U+2014&gt;to conclude that independence was preferable to continued Soviet rule.</p>

<p>Opposition pressure on the communist government was manifested in popular demonstrations and strikes, which ultimately resulted in an open, multiparty and democratic parliamentary election being held on 28 October 1990 in which the Round Table/Free Georgia bloc captured 54 percent of the proportional vote to gain 155 seats out of the 250 up for election, while the communists gained 64 seats and 30 percent of the proportional vote.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The leading dissident <a href="Zviad_Gamsakhurdia" title="wikilink">Zviad Gamsakhurdia</a> became the head of the <a href="Supreme_Council_of_the_Republic_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia</a>. On March 31, 1991, Gamsakhurdia wasted no time in organising a <a href="Georgian_independence_referendum,_1991" title="wikilink">referendum on independence</a>, which was approved by 98.9% of the votes. Formal independence from the Soviet Union was declared on April 9, 1991, although it took some time before it was widely recognised by outside powers such as the United States and European countries. Gamsakhurdia's government strongly opposed any vestiges of Russian dominance, such as the remaining Soviet military bases in the republic, and (after the <a href="dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">dissolution of the Soviet Union</a>) his government declined to join the <a href="Commonwealth_of_Independent_States" title="wikilink">Commonwealth of Independent States</a> (CIS).</p>
<p>Gamsakhurdia was elected president on May 26, 1991, with 86% of the vote. He was subsequently widely criticised for what was perceived to be an erratic and authoritarian style of government, with nationalists and reformists joining forces in an uneasy anti-Gamsakhurdia coalition. A tense situation was worsened by the large amount of ex-Soviet weaponry available to the quarreling parties and by the growing power of paramilitary groups. The situation came to a head on December 22, 1991, when armed opposition groups launched a violent military <a href="coup_d&#39;&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat" title="wikilink">coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat</a>, besieging Gamsakhurdia and his supporters in government buildings in central Tbilisi.

In August 1992, a separatist dispute in the Georgian autonomous republic of <a href="Abkhazia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Abkhazia</a> escalated when government forces and paramilitaries were sent into the area to quell separatist activities. The Abkhaz fought back with help from paramilitaries from Russia's North Caucasus regions and alleged covert support from Russian military stationed in a base in <a href="Gudauta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gudauta</a>, Abkhazia and in September 1993 the government forces suffered a catastrophic defeat, which led to them being driven out and the entire Georgian population of the region being expelled. Around 14,000 people died and another 300,000 were forced to flee.</p>
<p>Ethnic violence also flared in <a href="South_Ossetia" title="wikilink">South Ossetia</a> but was eventually quelled, although at the cost of several hundred casualties and 100,000 refugees fleeing into Russian-controlled North Ossetia. In south-western Georgia, the autonomous republic of <a href="Ajaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ajaria</a> came under the control of <a href="Aslan_Abashidze" title="wikilink">Aslan Abashidze</a>, who managed to rule his republic from 1991 to 2004 as a personal fiefdom in which the Tbilisi government had little influence.</p>
<p>On September 24, 1993, in the wake of the Abkhaz disaster, <a href="Zviad_Gamsakhurdia" title="wikilink">Zviad Gamsakhurdia</a> returned from exile to organise an uprising against the government. His supporters were able to capitalise on the disarray of the government forces and quickly overran much of western Georgia. This alarmed Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and units of the Russian Army were sent into Georgia to assist the government. Gamsakhurdia's rebellion quickly collapsed and he died on December 31, 1993, apparently after being cornered by his enemies. In a highly controversial agreement, Shevardnadze's government agreed that it would join the <a href="Commonwealth_of_Independent_States" title="wikilink">CIS</a> as part of the price for military and political support.</p>
<p>Shevardnadze narrowly survived a bomb attack in August 1995 that he blamed on his erstwhile paramilitary allies. He took the opportunity to imprison the paramilitary leader <a href="Jaba_Ioseliani" title="wikilink">Jaba Ioseliani</a> and ban his <a href="Mkhedrioni" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mkhedrioni</a> militia in what was proclaimed as a strike against &quot;mafia forces&quot;. However, his government&lt;U+2014&gt;and his own family&lt;U+2014&gt;became increasingly associated with pervasive corruption that hampered Georgia's economic growth. He won presidential elections in November 1995 and April 2000 with large majorities, but there were persistent allegations of vote-rigging.</p>

Further friction was caused by Shevardnadze's close relationship with the United States, which saw him as a counterbalance to Russian influence in the strategic Transcaucasus region. Georgia became a major recipient of <a href="United_States_of_America" title="wikilink">US</a> foreign and military aid, signed a strategic partnership with <a href="NATO" class="uri" title="wikilink">NATO</a> and declared an ambition to join both NATO and the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">EU</a>.

<p>These results were annulled by the Georgia Supreme Court after the <a href="Rose_Revolution" title="wikilink">Rose Revolution</a> on November 25, 2003, following allegations of widespread <a href="electoral_fraud" title="wikilink">electoral fraud</a> and large public protests, which led to the resignation of Shevardnadze.</p>

<p>The new president faced many problems on coming to office. More than 230,000 <a href="internally_displaced_person" title="wikilink">internally displaced persons</a> put an enormous strain on the economy.

<p>The <a href="Rose_Revolution" title="wikilink">Rose Revolution</a> raised many expectations, both domestically and abroad. The new government was expected to bring democracy, ending a period of widespread corruption and government inefficiency; and to complete <a href="state-building" class="uri" title="wikilink">state-building</a> by re-asserting sovereignty over the whole Georgian territory. Both aims were very ambitious; the new ruling elite initiated a process of concentration of power in the hands of the executive, in order to use the revolutionary mandate to change the country. In fact, the Saakashvili government initially achieved impressive results in strengthening the capacity of the state and toppling corruption; but such achievements could only result from the use of unilateral executive powers, failing to achieve consent and initiating a trade-off between democracy-building and state-building.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>After the Rose Revolution, relations between the Georgian government and semi-separatist Ajarian leader <a href="Aslan_Abashidze" title="wikilink">Aslan Abashidze</a> deteriorated rapidly, with Abashidze rejecting Saakashvili's demands for the writ of the Tbilisi government to run in <a href="Ajaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ajaria</a>. Both sides mobilised forces in apparent preparations for a military confrontation. Saakashvili's ultimatums and massive street demonstrations forced Abashidze to resign and flee Georgia (<a href="2004_Adjara_crisis" title="wikilink">2004 Adjara crisis</a>).</p>
<p>Relations with Russia remained problematic due to Russia's continuing political, economic and military support to separatist governments in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russian troops still remained garrisoned at two military bases and as peacekeepers in these regions. Saakashvili's public pledge to resolve the matter provoked criticism from the separatist regions and Russia. In August 2004, several clashes occurred in South Ossetia.</p>
<p>Integration into <a href="NATO" class="uri" title="wikilink">NATO</a> and the <a href="EU" class="uri" title="wikilink">EU</a> remains the main goal of Georgia's foreign policy. On October 29, 2004, the <a href="North_Atlantic_Council" title="wikilink">North Atlantic Council</a> (NAC) of NATO approved the <a href="Individual_Partnership_Action_Plan" title="wikilink">Individual Partnership Action Plan</a> of Georgia (IPAP). Georgia is the first among NATO's partner countries to manage this task successfully.</p>
<p>Georgia continues to support the coalition forces in <a href="Iraq" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iraq</a>. On November 8, 2004, 300 extra Georgian troops were sent to Iraq. The Georgian government committed to send a total of 850 troops to Iraq to serve in the protection forces of the <a href="UN" class="uri" title="wikilink">UN</a> Mission. Along with increasing Georgian troops in Iraq, the US will train additional 4 thousand Georgian soldiers within frames of the Georgia <a href="Train-and-Equip_Program" title="wikilink">Train-and-Equip Program</a> (GTEP).</p>
<p>In February 2005 Prime Minister <a href="Zurab_Zhvania" title="wikilink">Zurab Zhvania</a> died, and <a href="Zurab_Nogaideli" title="wikilink">Zurab Nogaideli</a> was appointed as the new Prime Minister. Saakashvili remained under significant pressure to deliver on his promised reforms. Organisations such as <a href="Amnesty_International" title="wikilink">Amnesty International</a> have pushed serious concerns over human rights.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Discontent over unemployment, pensions and corruption, and the continuing dispute over Abkhazia, have greatly diminished Saakashvili's popularity in the country.</p>
<p>In 2006 Georgia's relationship with Russia was at nadir due to the <a href="2006_Georgian-Russian_espionage_controversy" title="wikilink">Georgian-Russian espionage controversy</a> and related events. In 2007, a political crisis led to serious <a href="2007_Georgian_demonstrations" title="wikilink">anti-government protests</a>, and Russia allegedly led a series of airspace violations against Georgia.</p>
<p>Since the weakening of the democratic credentials of the Saakashvili cabinet after the police crackdown of the <a href="2007_Georgian_demonstrations" title="wikilink">2007 protests</a>, the government has put the stress on his successful economic reforms. <a href="Kakha_Bendukidze" title="wikilink">Kakha Bendukidze</a> was pivotal in the <a href="Libertarianism" title="wikilink">libertarian</a> reforms launched under Saakashvili, including one of the least restrictive labour codes, the lowest flat income tax rates (12%) and some of the lowest customs rates worldwide, along with the drastic reduction of necessary licenses and permits for business.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The objective of the Georgian elite switched to the aim of &quot;a functioning democracy with the highest possible level of economic liberties&quot;, as expressed by the prime minister <a href="Lado_Gurgenidze" title="wikilink">Lado Gurgenidze</a>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>In August 2008 Russia and Georgia engaged in the <a href="2008_South_Ossetia_war" title="wikilink">2008 South Ossetia war</a>.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Its aftermath, leading to the <a href="2008&lt;U+2013&gt;2010_Georgia&lt;U+2013&gt;Russia_crisis" title="wikilink">2008&lt;U+2013&gt;2010 Georgia&lt;U+2013&gt;Russia crisis</a>, is still tense.</p>
