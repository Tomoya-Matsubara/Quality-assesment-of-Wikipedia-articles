<p>The <a href="1931_World_Series" title="wikilink">1931 World Series</a> was a rematch of the previous year's participants, pitting the Cardinals against the <a href="1931_Philadelphia_Athletics_season" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Athletics</a>.

He scored the first <a href="Run_(baseball)" title="wikilink">run</a> of the game in the second <a href="Inning_(baseball)" title="wikilink">inning</a> by stretching a <a href="Single_(baseball)" title="wikilink">single</a> into a double when the ball was bobbled in the outfield, stealing third base, then scoring on a <a href="sacrifice_fly" title="wikilink">sacrifice fly</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Martin added another run in the seventh inning when he hit a single, stole second base, took third base on a <a href="fielder&#39;s_choice" title="wikilink">fielder's choice</a>, then scored on a <a href="Squeeze_play_(baseball)" title="wikilink">squeeze bunt</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Those would be the only runs of the game as Hallahan pitched a three-hit <a href="shutout" class="uri" title="wikilink">shutout</a> to even the series at one win apiece.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The series then moved to <a href="Shibe_Park" title="wikilink">Shibe Park</a> in Philadelphia for Game 3 where, Martin had two hits, including a double and scored twice in a 5-2 Cardinals' victory over Grove.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In Game 4, he produced the only two hits by the Cardinals as they lost to Earnshaw 3 to 0.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Martin almost single-handedly provided the offense for the Cardinals in Game 5, driving home four runs with 2 singles, a home run and a sacrifice fly as, the Cardinals triumphed 5 to 1.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Although Martin was held hitless in the final two games of the series, he made an impressive catch to squelch an Athletics two-run rally in the ninth inning of Game 7 to end the game and clinch the world championship for the Cardinals.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> He set a <a href="World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a> record with 12 <a href="Hit_(baseball)" title="wikilink">hits</a> including 4 doubles, 1 home run, 5 stolen bases and 5 runs batted in.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Without him, the Cardinals batted for just a .205 team batting average.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Martin's .500 series batting average may have made the difference in the series outcome.

<p>He experienced an injury-plagued season in <a href="1932_St._Louis_Cardinals_season" title="wikilink">1932</a>, missing several weeks when he dislocated his shoulder in April and missed a month and a half when he broke a finger in July while sliding into <a href="home_plate" title="wikilink">home plate</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> In August, Cardinals manager <a href="Gabby_Street" title="wikilink">Gabby Street</a> converted Martin into a third baseman in an attempt to fill the gap left by injured <a href="Sparky_Adams" title="wikilink">Sparky Adams</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Martin wasn't a naturally gifted third baseman, often fielding balls after having stopped them with his chest.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> He ended the season with a .238 batting average with 4 home runs and 34 runs batted in as the Cardinals fell to seventh place in the National League.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Martin rebounded from his injuries in <a href="1933_St._Louis_Cardinals_season" title="wikilink">1933</a>, and was leading the league in hitting with a .363 batting average in the middle of June, earning him a starting role as the third baseman for the National League team in the inaugural <a href="Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball All-Star Game</a> held on July 6, <a href="1933_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game" title="wikilink">1933</a>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Now hitting as the Cardinals' <a href="leadoff_hitter" title="wikilink">leadoff hitter</a>, he finished the season ranked sixth in the league with a career-high .316 average and, led the league with 122 runs scored and 26 stolen bases.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Martin ranked tenth in the league with a .456 <a href="slugging_percentage" title="wikilink">slugging percentage</a> and, had a career-high .387 <a href="on_base_percentage" title="wikilink">on base percentage</a> along with 36 doubles, 12 <a href="Triple_(baseball)" title="wikilink">triples</a> and 8 home runs as the Cardinals improved to a fifth place finish.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> He came in fifth place in the voting results for the  National League <a href="Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" title="wikilink">Most Valuable Player Award</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Martin's batting average dropped to .289 in <a href="1934_St._Louis_Cardinals_season" title="wikilink">1934</a> but, he once again led the league in stolen bases as, the Cardinals rallied from seven games behind the <a href="1934_New_York_Giants_(MLB)_season" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a> in early September to win the National League pennant on the last day of the season.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> He made an appearance as a <a href="relief_pitcher" title="wikilink">relief pitcher</a> on August 19, allowing one hit in two innings pitched.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> In a memorable <a href="1934_World_Series" title="wikilink">1934 World Series</a> against the <a href="1934_Detroit_Tigers_season" title="wikilink">Detroit Tigers</a>, the Cardinals were down 3 games to 2, before rebounding to win the final two games.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The series was highlighted by several, rough plays on the base paths that culminated in Game 7 when, Joe Medwick made a rough slide into Tigers' third baseman <a href="Marvin_Owen" title="wikilink">Marvin Owen</a>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The following inning, outraged Detroit fans pelted Medwick with debris when he assumed his defensive position in the outfield.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The disturbance wasn't quelled until the umpires appealed to Baseball Commissioner <a href="Kenesaw_Mountain_Landis" title="wikilink">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a>, who had Medwick removed from the game.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Martin ended the series with 11 hits for a .355 average, stole 2 bases and scored 8 runs in the series.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> He experienced difficulties in the field, committing 3 <a href="Error_(baseball)" title="wikilink">errors</a> in Game 4 and, setting a World Series record with 4 errors overall.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>While in a St. Louis hospital in December 1934, for a minor operation on his left arm, Martin insisted that he be entertained by a <a href="Western_music_(North_America)" title="wikilink">cowboy</a> musical group that he had hired. He created such a disturbance among the other patients that the hospital staff moved him to an isolated wing.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Although Martin had a good year offensively in <a href="1935_St._Louis_Cardinals_season" title="wikilink">1935</a>, he continued to struggle defensively at third base. In the midst of a tight <a href="pennant_race" title="wikilink">pennant race</a> in July, he committed three costly errors in a loss to the New York Giants and, ended the year with 30 errors.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> He was hitting for a .333 average by mid-season to earn the starting third baseman's position in the <a href="1935_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game" title="wikilink">1935 All-Star Game</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> For the season, he hit for a .299 average with 9 home runs and 54 runs batted in.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

<p>Although he continued to hit well, by <a href="1937_St._Louis_Cardinals_season" title="wikilink">1937</a>, Martin was relegated to a part-time role as, his spirited, headlong style of play took its toll on his body.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> At the beginning of the <a href="1939_St._Louis_Cardinals_season" title="wikilink">1939</a> season, he was named as the Cardinals' team captain, taking the job from Leo Durocher who had been traded to the Brooklyn Dodgers.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> He experienced a resurgence, leading the team with a .340 batting average in June before a sprained wrist put him out of action for two weeks.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> He ended the season with a .306 batting average in 88 games, helping the Cardinals to finish second in the National League.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Martin hit for a respectable .316 average in <a href="1940_St._Louis_Cardinals_season" title="wikilink">1940</a> before the Cardinals named him as the <a href="player-manager" class="uri" title="wikilink">player-manager</a> of the <a href="Sacramento_Solons" title="wikilink">Sacramento Solons</a> of the <a href="Pacific_Coast_League" title="wikilink">Pacific Coast League</a> in October.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
