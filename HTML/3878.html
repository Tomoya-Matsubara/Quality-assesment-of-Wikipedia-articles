<p><strong>De Benneville &quot;Bert&quot; Bell</strong> (February 25, 1895 &lt;U+2013&gt; October 11, 1959) was the <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a> (NFL) commissioner from 1945 until his death in 1959. As commissioner, he introduced competitive parity into the NFL to ameliorate the league's commercial viability and enhance its popularity, and he assisted in making the NFL the most financially sound sport's enterprise, and the dominant sports attraction, in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> (US). He was posthumously enshrined into the charter class of the <a href="Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a>.</p>
<p>Bell played football at the <a href="University_of_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">University of Pennsylvania</a>, and as <a href="quarterback" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarterback</a> for the <a href="Penn_Quakers_football" title="wikilink">Quakers</a>, he led his team to an appearance in the <a href="1917_Rose_Bowl" title="wikilink">1917 Rose Bowl</a>. He was drafted into the US <a href="United_States_Army" title="wikilink">Army</a> during <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> before ending his collegiate days at Penn and becoming an assistant football coach with the Quakers in the 1920s. During the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a>, he was an assistant coach for the <a href="Temple_Owls_football" title="wikilink">Temple Owls</a> and a co-founder and co-owner of the <a href="Philadelphia_Eagles" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Eagles</a>.</p>
<p>With the Eagles, Bell convinced the other NFL owners to establish the <a href="National_Football_League_Draft" title="wikilink">National Football League Draft</a> in order to afford the weakest teams the first opportunity to sign the best available players. He subsequently became the sole proprietor of the Eagles, but the franchise suffered financially. Eventually, he sold the Eagles and bought a stake in the <a href="Pittsburgh_Steelers" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>. During <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, Bell auspiciously argued against the league suspending operations until the war's conclusion.</p>
<p>After the war, he was elected NFL commissioner and sold his ownership in the Steelers. As commissioner, he implemented a proactive anti-gambling agenda, negotiated a merger with the <a href="All-America_Football_Conference" title="wikilink">All-America Football Conference</a> (AAFC), and unilaterally crafted the entire league schedule with an emphasis on augmenting the dramatic effect of late season matches. During the <a href="Golden_Age_of_Television" title="wikilink">Golden Age of Television</a>, he tailored the game's rules to strengthen its appeal to mass media, and enforced a blackout policy of locally televised home contests to safeguard ticket receipts. Amidst criticism from franchise owners and under pressure from <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">Congress</a>, he unilaterally recognized the <a href="National_Football_League_Players_Association" title="wikilink">NFLPA</a> and facilitated in the composing of the first pension plan for the players. His life would abide to oversee the <a href="1958_NFL_Championship_Game" title="wikilink">&quot;Greatest Game Ever Played&quot;</a> and to envision what the league would become in the future.</p>

<p>Bell was &quot;a man of buoyant joviality, with a rough and ready wit, laughter and genuine humility and honesty, clearly innocent of pretense and [pretension].&quot;<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a> Though his career spanned the <a href="Black_players_in_American_professional_football" title="wikilink">desegregation and reintegration of the NFL</a>, as an owner, he never had an African American on any of his teams, but Bert Jr. believed the mere discussion of whether his father was prejudiced was absurd.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> Bell's handling of the merger with the AAFC was acclaimed as a personal triumph.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> Although he did not have the wherewithal to prevent the wholesale betting on games,<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> he was proactive in ensuring games were not tampered with by gamblers,<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> and he created the foundation of the contemporary NFL anti-gambling policy.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a></p>
<p>Bell was criticized as being too strict with his refusal to let sold-out games to be televised locally.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> Nevertheless, his balancing of television broadcasts against protecting game attendance made the NFL the &quot;healthiest professional sport in America&quot;,<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> and he was the &quot;leading protagonist in pro football's evolution into America's major sport.&quot;<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> He had understood that the league needed a cooperative television contract with revenue-sharing, but he failed to overcome the obstacles to achieve it.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a> He was portrayed by sportswriters as ensuring the owners treated the players fairly,<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> and his decision to recognize the NFLPA in the face of adversity from owners was a &quot;master stroke&quot; in thwarting Congressional intervention.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> After he initiated terms for a pension plan with the players in 1959, little progress was made with the NFLPA,<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a><a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a> however, the first players' pension plan-the Bert Bell National Football League Retirement Plan, was approved in 1962.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a></p>
<p>Bell's implementation of the draft did not show immediate results,<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a> but it was &quot;the single greatest contributor to the [league]'s prosperity&quot; in its first eighty-four years.<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a> His original version of the draft was later ruled unconstitutional,<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a> but his anchoring of the success of the league to competitive balance has been &quot;hailed by contemporaries and sports historians&quot;.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> Bell had often said, &quot;[o]n any given Sunday, any team in the NFL can beat any other team.&quot;<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a></p>
