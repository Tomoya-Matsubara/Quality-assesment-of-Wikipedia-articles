Jacqueline had a younger sister, <a href="Lee_Radziwill" title="wikilink">Caroline Lee</a> (known as Lee), born in 1933. Her parents divorced in 1940 and her mother married <a href="Standard_Oil" title="wikilink">Standard Oil</a> heir <a href="Hugh_D._Auchincloss,_Jr." title="wikilink">Hugh D. Auchincloss, Jr.</a> in 1942. Through Janet's second marriage, Jacqueline gained a half sister and a half brother, <a href="Janet_Auchincloss_Rutherfurd" title="wikilink">Janet</a> and James Auchincloss.</p>
<p><img src="Jacqueline_Bouvier_by_David_Berne,_1935.jpg" title="fig:Jacqueline Bouvier in 1935." alt="Jacqueline Bouvier in 1935." /> Her mother's family, the Lees, were mostly of <a href="Irish_American" title="wikilink">Irish</a> descent, and her father, John Vernou Bouvier III, was descended from <a href="French_American" title="wikilink">French</a> and <a href="English_American" title="wikilink">English</a> people. Michel Bouvier, Jacqueline's great-great-grandfather, was born in France and was a contemporary of <a href="Joseph_Bonaparte" title="wikilink">Joseph Bonaparte</a> and <a href="Stephen_Girard" title="wikilink">Stephen Girard</a>.

Jacqueline's grandfather, John Vernou Bouvier Jr., fashioned a more noble ancestry for his family in his vanity family history book <em>Our Forebears</em>.

<p>Kennedy is remembered for reorganizing entertainment for White House Social events, seeking to restore several White House interiors, her taste in clothing worn during Kennedy's Presidency, her popularity among foreign dignitaries, and leading the country in mourning after her husband's assassination in 1963.</p>

<p>The restoration of the <a href="White_House" title="wikilink">White House</a> was Jacqueline Kennedy's first major project. She was dismayed during her pre-inauguration tour of the White House to find little of historic significance in the house. The rooms were furnished with undistinguished pieces that she felt lacked a sense of history. Her first efforts, begun her first day in residence (with the help of society decorator <a href="Sister_Parish" title="wikilink">Sister Parish</a>), were to make the family quarters attractive and suitable for family life and included the addition of a kitchen on the family floor and rooms for her children. Upon almost immediately exhausting the funds appropriated for this effort, she established a fine arts committee to oversee and fund the restoration process; she also asked early American furniture expert <a href="Henry_Francis_du_Pont" title="wikilink">Henry du Pont</a> to consult.</p>
<p>Her skillful management of this project was hardly noted at the time, except in terms of gossipy shock at repeated repainting of a room, or the high cost of the antique Zuber wallpaper panels installed in the family dining room ($12,000 in donated funds), but later accounts have noted that she managed the conflicting agendas of Parish, du Pont, and Boudin with seamless success;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> she initiated publication of the first White House guidebook, whose sales further funded the restoration; she initiated a Congressional bill establishing that White House furnishings would be the property of the <a href="Smithsonian_Institution" title="wikilink">Smithsonian Institution</a>, rather than available to departing ex-presidents to claim as their own; and she wrote personal requests to those who owned pieces of historical interest that might be, and later were, donated to the White House.</p>
<p>On February 14, 1962, Jacqueline Kennedy took American television viewers on a tour of the <a href="White_House" title="wikilink">White House</a> with <a href="Charles_Collingwood_(journalist)" title="wikilink">Charles Collingwood</a> of <a href="CBS_News" title="wikilink">CBS</a>. In the tour she said, &quot;I just feel that everything in the White House should be the best&lt;U+2014&gt;the entertainment that's given here. If it's an American company you can help, I like to do that. If not&lt;U+2014&gt;just as long as it's the best.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Working with Rachel Lambert Mellon, she oversaw redesign and replanting of the <a href="White_House_Rose_Garden" title="wikilink">White House Rose Garden</a> and the East Garden, which was renamed the <a href="Jacqueline_Kennedy_Garden" title="wikilink">Jacqueline Kennedy Garden</a> after her husband's assassination. Her efforts on behalf of restoration and preservation at the White House left a lasting legacy in the form of the <a href="White_House_Historical_Association" title="wikilink">White House Historical Association</a>, the <a href="Committee_for_the_Preservation_of_the_White_House" title="wikilink">Committee for the Preservation of the White House</a> which was based upon her White House Furnishings Committee, a permanent <a href="Curator_of_the_White_House" title="wikilink">Curator of the White House</a>, the <a href="White_House_Endowment_Trust" title="wikilink">White House Endowment Trust</a>, and the <a href="White_House_Acquisition_Trust" title="wikilink">White House Acquisition Trust</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Broadcasting of the White House restoration greatly helped the Kennedy administration.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The United States sought international support during the Cold War, which it achieved by affecting public opinion. The First Lady's celebrity and high profile status made viewing the tour of the White house very desirable. The tour was taped and distributed to 106 countries since there was a great demand from the elite as well as people in power to see the film. In 1962 at the 14th Annual <a href="Emmy_Awards" title="wikilink">Emmy Awards</a> (NBC, May 22), <a href="Bob_Newhart" title="wikilink">Bob Newhart</a> emceed from the <a href="Hollywood_Palladium" title="wikilink">Hollywood Palladium</a>; <a href="Johnny_Carson" title="wikilink">Johnny Carson</a> from the New York Astor Hotel; and NBC newsman <a href="David_Brinkley" title="wikilink">David Brinkley</a> hosted at the Sheraton Park Hotel in Washington D.C. and took the spotlight as a special <a href="Academy_of_Television_Arts_&amp;_Sciences" title="wikilink">Academy of Television Arts and Sciences</a> Trustees Award was given to Jacqueline Kennedy for her CBS-TV tour of the White House.

The actual Emmy statuette is on display in the <a href="Kennedy_Library" title="wikilink">Kennedy Library</a> located in <a href="Boston,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Boston, Massachusetts</a>. Focus and admiration for Jacqueline Kennedy took negative attention away from her husband. By attracting worldwide public attention, the First Lady gained allies for the White House and international support for the Kennedy administration and its Cold War policies.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>Early in 1963, Kennedy became pregnant again and curtailed her official duties. She spent most of the summer at the Kennedys' rented home on Squaw Island, near the Kennedy family's <a href="Cape_Cod" title="wikilink">Cape Cod</a> compound at <a href="Hyannis_Port" title="wikilink">Hyannis Port</a>, where she went into premature labor on August 7, 1963.

<p>On November 21, 1963, the First Couple left the White House for a political trip to Texas, stopping in <a href="San_Antonio" title="wikilink">San Antonio</a>, <a href="Houston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Houston</a>, and <a href="Fort_Worth" title="wikilink">Fort Worth</a> that day. After a breakfast on November 22, the Kennedys flew from <a href="Carswell_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Carswell Air Force Base</a> to Dallas's <a href="Dallas_Love_Field" title="wikilink">Love Field</a> on <a href="VC-137C_SAM_26000" title="wikilink">Air Force One</a>, accompanied by Texas Governor <a href="John_Connally" title="wikilink">John Connally</a> and his wife <a href="Nellie_Connally" title="wikilink">Nellie</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> A  <a href="motorcade" class="uri" title="wikilink">motorcade</a> was to take them to the Trade Mart where the President was scheduled to speak at a lunch. The First Lady was seated next to her husband in the limousine, with the Governor and his wife seated in front of them. Vice President Johnson and his wife followed in another car in the motorcade.</p>
<p>After the motorcade turned the corner onto Elm Street in <a href="Dealey_Plaza" title="wikilink">Dealey Plaza</a>, the First Lady heard what she thought to be a motorcycle <a href="Back-fire" title="wikilink">backfiring</a>, and did not realize that it was a gunshot until she heard <a href="John_Connally" title="wikilink">Governor Connally</a> scream. Within 8.4 seconds, two more shots had rung out, and she leaned toward her husband. The final shot struck the President in the head.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Shocked, she climbed out of the back seat and crawled over the trunk of the car. Her Secret Service agent, <a href="Clint_Hill" title="wikilink">Clint Hill</a>, later told the <a href="Warren_Commission" title="wikilink">Warren Commission</a> that he thought she had been reaching across the trunk for a piece of the President's skull that had been blown off.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Hill ran to the car and leapt onto it, directing her back to her seat. The car rushed to Dallas's <a href="Parkland_Hospital" title="wikilink">Parkland Hospital</a>, and on arrival there, the president's body was rushed into a trauma room. The First Lady, for the moment, remained in a room for relatives and friends of patients just outside.</p>
<p>A few minutes into her husband's treatment, accompanied by the President's doctor, Admiral George Burkley, she left her folding chair outside Trauma Room One and attempted to enter the operating room. Nurse Doris Nelson stopped her and attempted to bar the door to prevent her from entering. She persisted, and the President's doctor suggested that she take a sedative, which she refused. &quot;I want to be there when he dies,&quot; she told Burkley. He eventually persuaded Nelson to grant her access to Trauma Room One, saying &quot;It's her right, it's her prerogative&quot;.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Later, when the casket arrived, the widow removed her wedding ring and slipped it onto the President's finger. She told aide <a href="Ken_O&#39;Donnell" title="wikilink">Ken O'Donnell</a>, &quot;Now I have nothing left.&quot;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p>After the president's death, she refused to remove her blood-stained clothing, and regretted having washed the blood off her face and hands. She continued to wear the blood-stained pink suit as she went on board Air Force One and stood next to Johnson when he took the oath of office as President. She told <a href="Lady_Bird_Johnson" title="wikilink">Lady Bird Johnson</a>, &quot;I want them to see what they have done to Jack.&quot;<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Kennedy took an active role in planning the details of the <a href="State_funeral_of_John_F._Kennedy" title="wikilink">state funeral</a> for her husband, which was based on Abraham Lincoln's. The funeral service was held at <a href="Cathedral_of_St._Matthew_the_Apostle" title="wikilink">St. Matthew's Cathedral</a>, Washington D.C., and the burial at <a href="Arlington_National_Cemetery" title="wikilink">Arlington National Cemetery</a>; the widow led the procession there on foot and would light the eternal flame at the grave site, a flame that had been created at her request. <a href="Jeanne_Campbell" title="wikilink">Lady Jeanne Campbell</a> reported back to <em><a href="The_London_Evening_Standard" title="wikilink">The London Evening Standard</a></em>: &quot;Jacqueline Kennedy has given the American people... one thing they have always lacked: Majesty.&quot;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the assassination and the media coverage which had focused intensely on her during and after the burial, Kennedy stepped back from official public view. She did, however, make a brief appearance in Washington to honor the <a href="United_States_Secret_Service" title="wikilink">Secret Service</a> agent, <a href="Clint_Hill" title="wikilink">Clint Hill</a>, who had climbed aboard the limousine in Dallas to try to shield her and the President. </p>
<h2 id="life-following-the-assassination">Life following the assassination</h2>
<p><img src="Jacqueline_Lee_Bouvier_Kennedy.gif" title="fig:Jackie Kennedy&#39;s Official White House Portrait" alt="Jackie Kennedy&#39;s Official White House Portrait" /> A week after the assassination, Jacqueline was interviewed in <a href="Hyannisport" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hyannisport</a> on November 29 by <a href="Theodore_H._White" title="wikilink">Theodore H. White</a> of <em><a href="Life_magazine" title="wikilink">Life</a></em> magazine. In that session, she compared the Kennedy years in the White House to <a href="King_Arthur" title="wikilink">King Arthur</a>'s mythical <a href="Camelot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Camelot</a>, commenting that the President often played the title song of <a href="Lerner_and_Loewe" title="wikilink">Lerner and Loewe</a>'s musical recording before retiring to bed. She also quoted <a href="Guinevere" title="wikilink">Queen Guinevere</a> from the musical, trying to express how the loss felt.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>Her steadiness and courage after her husband's assassination and funeral won her admiration around the world.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Following his death, Kennedy and her children remained in their quarters in the White House for two weeks, preparing to vacate. They spent the winter of 1964 in <a href="Averell_Harriman" title="wikilink">Averell Harriman</a>'s home in the <a href="Georgetown,_Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Georgetown section of Washington, D.C.</a>, before purchasing her own home on another block of the same street. Later in 1964, in the hope of having more privacy for her children,<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Kennedy decided to acquire an apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York City and sold her new Georgetown house; she also sold the country home in Atoka, Virginia, where she and President Kennedy had intended to retire.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> She spent a year in mourning,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> making few public appearances; during this time, Caroline told one of her teachers that her mother cried frequently.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>Kennedy perpetuated her husband's memory by attending selected memorial dedications. These included the 1967 christening of the <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">Navy</a> <a href="aircraft_carrier" title="wikilink">aircraft carrier</a>  (decommissioned in 2007), in Newport News, Virginia, and a memorial in <a href="Hyannisport" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hyannisport</a>, Massachusetts. They also included the dedication of the United Kingdom's official memorial to President Kennedy at <a href="Runnymede" class="uri" title="wikilink">Runnymede</a>, England, and the dedication of a park near <a href="New_Ross" title="wikilink">New Ross</a>, <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>. She oversaw plans for the establishment of the <a href="John_F._Kennedy_Library" title="wikilink">John F. Kennedy Library</a>, which is the repository for official papers of the Kennedy Administration. Original plans to have the library situated in <a href="Cambridge,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>, near <a href="Harvard_University" title="wikilink">Harvard University</a>, proved problematic for various reasons, so it is situated in Boston. The finished library, designed by <a href="I.M._Pei" title="wikilink">I.M. Pei</a>, includes a museum and was dedicated in Boston in 1979 by President <a href="Jimmy_Carter" title="wikilink">Jimmy Carter</a>.</p>
<p>In November 1967, during the midst of the <a href="Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">Vietnam War</a>, <a href="Life_Magazine" title="wikilink">Life Magazine</a> recognized Jacqueline as &quot;America's unofficial roving ambassador&quot; during her visit to Cambodia when she met with Chief of State <a href="Norodom_Sihanouk" title="wikilink">Norodom Sihanouk</a>. During the visit, Kennedy joined Sihanouk on a visit to <a href="Angkor_Wat" title="wikilink">Angkor Wat</a>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> At that point, diplomatic relations between the US and Cambodia had been broken since May 1965.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="onassis-marriage">Onassis marriage</h2>

<p>During her widowhood, Jacqueline was romantically linked by the press to a few men, notably <a href="David_Ormsby-Gore" title="wikilink">David Ormsby-Gore</a> and <a href="Roswell_Gilpatric" title="wikilink">Roswell Gilpatric</a>. But in June 1968 when her brother-in-law <a href="Robert_F._Kennedy" title="wikilink">Robert F. Kennedy</a> was assassinated, she came to fear for her life and that of her children, saying &quot;If they're killing Kennedys, then my children are targets...I want to get out of this country.&quot;<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> On October 20, 1968 she married <a href="Aristotle_Onassis" title="wikilink">Aristotle Onassis</a>, a wealthy, Greek shipping magnate, who was able to provide the privacy and security she needed for herself and her children.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>The wedding took place on <a href="Skorpios" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skorpios</a>, Onassis's private island in the <a href="Ionian_Sea" title="wikilink">Ionian Sea</a>, Greece. After her marriage to Onassis, Jacqueline lost her Secret Service protection and her <a href="Franking#Franking_Privilege" title="wikilink">Franking Privilege</a>, both of which are entitlements to a widow of the President of the United States. As a result of the marriage, the media gave her the nickname &quot;Jackie O.&quot; which has remained a popular shorthand reference to her. She became the target of <a href="paparazzi" class="uri" title="wikilink">paparazzi</a> who were following her.</p>
<p>Then tragedy struck again, as Aristotle Onassis's only son <a href="Alexander_Onassis" title="wikilink">Alexander</a> died in a plane crash in January 1973. Onassis's health began deteriorating rapidly and he died in Paris, on March 15, 1975. Jacqueline's financial legacy was severely limited under Greek law, which dictated how much a non-Greek surviving spouse could inherit. After two years of legal battle, she eventually accepted from <a href="Christina_Onassis" title="wikilink">Christina Onassis</a>, Onassis's daughter and sole heir, a settlement of $26,000,000, waiving all other claims to the Onassis estate.</p>
<h2 id="later-years">Later years</h2>

<p>Onassis's death in 1975 made her, then nearly 46, a widow for the second time. Now that her children were older, she decided to find work that would be fulfilling to her. Since she had always enjoyed writing and literature, in 1975 Jacqueline accepted a job offer as an editor at <a href="Viking_Press" title="wikilink">Viking Press</a>. But, in 1978, the President of Viking Press, <a href="Thomas_H._Guinzburg" title="wikilink">Thomas H. Guinzburg</a>, authorized the purchase of the Jeffrey Archer novel <em><a href="Shall_We_Tell_the_President?" title="wikilink">Shall We Tell the President?</a></em>, which was set in a fictional future presidency of <a href="Edward_M._Kennedy" title="wikilink">Edward M. Kennedy</a> and described an assassination plot against him. Although Guinzburg cleared the book purchase and publication with Onassis, upon the publication of a negative <em>New York Times</em> review which asserted that Onassis held some responsibility for its publication, she abruptly resigned from Viking Press the next day.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> She then moved to <a href="Doubleday_(publisher)" title="wikilink">Doubleday</a> as an associate editor under an old friend, <a href="John_Turner_Sargent,_Sr." title="wikilink">John Sargent</a>, living in New York City, <a href="Martha&#39;s_Vineyard" title="wikilink">Martha's Vineyard</a> and the <a href="Kennedy_Compound" title="wikilink">Kennedy Compound</a> in <a href="Hyannis,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Hyannis, Massachusetts</a>. From the mid 1970s until her death, her companion was <a href="Maurice_Tempelsman" title="wikilink">Maurice Tempelsman</a>, a Belgian-born industrialist and <a href="diamond" class="uri" title="wikilink">diamond</a> merchant who was long separated from his wife.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>She also continued to be the subject of much press attention, most notoriously involving the photographer <a href="Ron_Galella" title="wikilink">Ron Galella</a>. He followed her around and photographed her as she went about her day-to-day activities, obtaining candid, iconic photos of her.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> She ultimately obtained a restraining order against him and the situation brought attention to <a href="paparazzi" class="uri" title="wikilink">paparazzi</a>-style photography.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> In 1995, John F. Kennedy Jr. allowed Galella to photograph him at public events.</p>
<p>Among the many books she edited was <a href="Larry_Gonick" title="wikilink">Larry Gonick</a>'s <em><a href="The_Cartoon_History_of_the_Universe" title="wikilink">The Cartoon History of the Universe</a></em>. He expressed his gratitude in the acknowledgments in Volume 2. Onassis's continuing charisma is indicated by the delight the Canadian author <a href="Robertson_Davies" title="wikilink">Robertson Davies</a> took in discovering that at a commencement exercise at an American university at which he was being honored, she was on hand, circulating among the honorees.</p>
<p><img src="Reagans_with_Jackie_Kennedy.jpg" title="fig:Former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in 1986 during a visit from the President and First Lady, Ronald and Nancy Reagan.

Nancy Reagan was the first First Lady since Kennedy to be regarded as generally glamorous, and thus the two were sometimes compared" /> Jacqueline Onassis also appreciated the contributions of African-American writers to the American literary canon. She encouraged <a href="Dorothy_West" title="wikilink">Dorothy West</a>, her neighbor on <a href="Martha&#39;s_Vineyard" title="wikilink">Martha's Vineyard</a> and the last surviving member of the <a href="Harlem_Renaissance" title="wikilink">Harlem Renaissance</a>, to complete <em>The Wedding</em>, a multi-generational story about race, class, wealth, and power in the United States. The novel received great literary acclaim when it was published by Doubleday in 1995; in 1998 <a href="Oprah_Winfrey" title="wikilink">Oprah Winfrey</a> introduced the story via a television film of the same name starring <a href="Halle_Berry" title="wikilink">Halle Berry</a>. <a href="Dorothy_West" title="wikilink">Dorothy West</a> acknowledged Jacqueline Onassis's kind encouragement in the foreword.</p>
<p>She also worked to preserve and protect America&lt;U+2019&gt;s cultural heritage. The notable results of her hard work include <a href="President&#39;s_Park" title="wikilink">Lafayette Square</a> in Washington, D.C, and <a href="Grand_Central_Terminal" title="wikilink">Grand Central Terminal</a>, New York's beloved historic railroad station.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> While she was First Lady, she helped to stop the destruction of historic homes in Lafayette Square, because she felt that these buildings were an important part of the nation&lt;U+2019&gt;s capital and played an essential role in its history.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Later, in New York City, she led a historic preservation campaign to save from demolition and renovate Grand Central Terminal.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> A plaque inside the terminal acknowledges her prominent role in its preservation.

<h2 id="death">Death</h2>
<p>In 1993, Onassis was diagnosed with <a href="non-Hodgkin&#39;s_lymphoma" title="wikilink">non-Hodgkin's lymphoma</a>, a form of <a href="cancer" class="uri" title="wikilink">cancer</a>. Her diagnosis was announced to the public in February. The family and doctors were initially optimistic, and she stopped smoking at the insistence of her daughter. Onassis continued her work with Doubleday, but curtailed her schedule. By April, the cancer had spread, and she made her last trip home from <a href="New_York_Hospital-Cornell_Medical_Center" title="wikilink">New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center</a> on May 18, 1994. A large crowd of well-wishers, tourists, and reporters gathered on the street outside her apartment. Onassis died in her sleep at 10:15 p.m. on Thursday, May 19, two and a half months before her 65th birthday. In announcing her death, Jacqueline's son, John Kennedy Jr. stated, &quot;My mother died surrounded by her friends and her family and her books, and the people and the things that she loved. She did it in her own way, and on her own terms, and we all feel lucky for that.&quot;<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>

<p>During her husband's presidency, Jacqueline Kennedy became a symbol of fashion for women all over the world. She retained French-born American fashion designer and Kennedy family friend <a href="Oleg_Cassini" title="wikilink">Oleg Cassini</a> in the fall of 1960 to create an original wardrobe for her as First Lady. From 1961 to late 1963, Cassini dressed her in many of her most iconic ensembles, including her Inauguration Day fawn coat and Inaugural gala gown as well as many outfits for her visits to Europe, India and Pakistan.

<p>In the years after the White House, her style changed dramatically. Gone were the modest &quot;campaign wife&quot; clothes. Wide-leg pantsuits, large lapel jackets, silk Hermes head scarves and large, round, dark sunglasses were her new look. She often chose to wear brighter colors and patterns and even began wearing jeans in public.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> She also experimented with different styles, often wearing a large amount of jewelry by <a href="Jean_Schlumberger_(Jewelry_designer)" title="wikilink">Jean Schlumberger (Jewelry designer)</a> and <a href="Van_Cleef_&amp;_Arpels" title="wikilink">Van Cleef &amp; Arpels</a>, hoop earrings with her hair pulled back, and gypsy skirts.</p>
