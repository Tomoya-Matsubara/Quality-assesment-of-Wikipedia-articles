<p>The <strong>Cretan War</strong> () or <strong>War of Candia</strong> (), as the <strong>Sixth <a href="Ottoman&lt;U+2013&gt;Venetian_Wars" title="wikilink">Ottoman&lt;U+2013&gt;Venetian War</a></strong> is better known, was a conflict between the <a href="Republic_of_Venice" title="wikilink">Republic of Venice</a> and her allies (chief among them the <a href="Knights_Hospitaller" title="wikilink">Knights of Malta</a>, the <a href="Papal_States" title="wikilink">Papal States</a> and <a href="Kingdom_of_France" title="wikilink">France</a>) against the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a> and the <a href="Barbary_States" title="wikilink">Barbary States</a>, fought over the island of <a href="Crete" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crete</a>, Venice's largest and richest <a href="Stato_da_M&lt;U+00E0&gt;r" title="wikilink">overseas possession</a>. The war lasted from 1645 to 1669 and was fought in Crete and in numerous naval engagements and raids around the <a href="Aegean_Sea" title="wikilink">Aegean Sea</a>, with <a href="Dalmatia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dalmatia</a> providing a secondary theater of operations.</p>
<p>Although most of Crete was conquered by the Ottomans in the first few years of the war, the fortress of Candia (modern <a href="Heraklion" class="uri" title="wikilink">Heraklion</a>), the capital of Crete, resisted successfully. Its <a href="Siege_of_Candia" title="wikilink">prolonged siege</a>, &quot;<a href="Trojan_War" title="wikilink">Troy's</a> rival&quot; as <a href="Lord_Byron" title="wikilink">Lord Byron</a> called it,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> forced both sides to focus their attention on the supply of their respective forces on the island. For the Venetians in particular, their only hope for victory over the larger Ottoman army in Crete lay in successfully starving it of supplies and reinforcements. Hence the war turned into a series of naval encounters between the two navies and their allies. Venice in particular was aided by various Western European nations, who, exhorted by the <a href="Pope" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pope</a> and in a revival of <a href="Crusades" title="wikilink">crusading spirit</a>, sent men, ships and supplies &quot;to defend Christendom&quot;. Throughout the war, Venice maintained overall naval superiority, winning most naval engagements, but the efforts to blockade the <a href="Dardanelles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dardanelles</a> were only partially successful, and the Republic never had enough ships to fully cut off the flow of supplies and reinforcements to Crete. The Ottomans themselves were hampered in their efforts by domestic turmoil, as well as the diversion of their forces north towards <a href="Transylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transylvania</a> and the <a href="Habsburg_Monarchy" title="wikilink">Habsburg Monarchy</a>.</p>
<p>The prolonged conflict exhausted the economy of the Republic, which relied on the lucrative trade with the Ottoman Empire. By the 1660s, despite increased aid from other Christian nations, war-weariness had set in. The Ottomans on the other hand, having managed to sustain their forces on Crete and reinvigorated under the capable leadership of the <a href="K&lt;U+00F6&gt;pr&lt;U+00FC&gt;l&lt;U+00FC&gt;_era" title="wikilink">K&lt;U+00F6&gt;pr&lt;U+00FC&gt;l&lt;U+00FC&gt; family</a>, sent a final great expedition in 1666 under the direct supervision of the <a href="Grand_Vizier" title="wikilink">Grand Vizier</a>. This began the final and bloodiest stage of the Siege of Candia, which lasted for more than two years. It ended with the negotiated surrender of the fortress, sealing the fate of the island and ending the war in an Ottoman victory. In the final peace treaty, Venice retained a few isolated island fortresses off Crete, and made some territorial gains in Dalmatia. The Venetian desire for a <em>revanche</em> would lead, barely 15 years later, to a renewed <a href="Morean_War" title="wikilink">war</a>, from which Venice would emerge victorious. Crete however was lost to the <em><a href="Republic_of_Venice" title="wikilink">Serenissima</a></em>; it would remain under Ottoman control until united with <a href="Greece" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greece</a> in 1912.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>After the loss of <a href="Cyprus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cyprus</a> to the Ottomans in the fifth <a href="Ottoman&lt;U+2013&gt;Venetian_War_(1570&lt;U+2013&gt;1573)" title="wikilink">Ottoman&lt;U+2013&gt;Venetian War (1570&lt;U+2013&gt;1573)</a>, the island of Crete was the last major overseas possession of Venice.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Its important strategic position made it an obvious target for future Ottoman expansion,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> while its size and fertile ground, together with the bad state of its fortresses, made it a more tempting prize than Malta.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> On the Venetian side, the <em>Serenissima</em>, with its weak military and great dependence on uninterrupted trade, was anxious not to provoke the Ottomans. Hence Venice scrupulously observed the terms of its treaty with the Ottomans, securing over sixty years of peaceful relations.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In the early 17th century moreover, Venetian power had declined considerably. Its economy, which had once prospered because of its control over the Eastern spice trade, had suffered as a result of the opening of the new <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic</a> trade routes, and from the loss of the important German market because of the <a href="Thirty_Years&#39;_War" title="wikilink">Thirty Years' War</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In addition, the Republic had become embroiled in a series of wars in northern Italy like the <a href="War_of_the_Mantuan_Succession" title="wikilink">Mantuan War</a>, and was further weakened by an <a href="Italian_Plague_of_1629&lt;U+2013&gt;1631" title="wikilink">outbreak of the plague</a> in 1629&lt;U+2013&gt;1631.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The potential for conflict between the Ottomans and Venice was still present, as evidenced in 1638, when a Venetian fleet <a href="Action_of_7_August_1638" title="wikilink">attacked and destroyed</a> a fleet of Barbary pirates that had sought protection in the Ottoman port of <a href="Vlor&lt;U+00EB&gt;" title="wikilink">Valona</a>, bombarding the city in the process.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Sultan <a href="Murad_IV" title="wikilink">Murad IV</a> was enraged: he threatened to execute all Venetians in the Empire, and put an embargo on Venetian trade.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Eventually, and given that the Ottomans were still engaged in a <a href="Ottoman&lt;U+2013&gt;Safavid_War_(1623&lt;U+2013&gt;1639)" title="wikilink">war</a> with the <a href="Safavid_dynasty" title="wikilink">Persians</a>, the situation was defused with the Republic paying the Ottomans an indemnity of 250,000 sequins.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>A similar episode however in 1644 had an entirely different outcome: on <a href="28_September" title="wikilink">28 September</a>, the Knights of Malta <a href="Action_of_28_September_1644" title="wikilink">attacked an Ottoman convoy</a> on its way from <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a> to <a href="Alexandria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a>, aboard which were a number of <a href="hajj" title="wikilink">pilgrims</a> bound for <a href="Mecca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mecca</a>, including the exiled <em><a href="Kizlar_Agha" title="wikilink">K&lt;U+0131&gt;zlar A&lt;U+011F&gt;a</a></em> (Chief Black Eunuch) S&lt;U+00FC&gt;nb&lt;U+00FC&gt;l A&lt;U+011F&gt;a, the <em><a href="kadi" class="uri" title="wikilink">kadi</a></em> of Cairo and the nurse of the future Sultan <a href="Mehmed_IV" title="wikilink">Mehmed IV</a>. During the fight, S&lt;U+00FC&gt;nb&lt;U+00FC&gt;l A&lt;U+011F&gt;a and most of the important pilgrims were slain, while 350 men and 30 women were taken to be sold as slaves.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The Knights loaded their loot on a ship, which docked at a small harbor on the southern coast of Crete for a few days, and disembarked a number of sailors and slaves.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The Ottomans were enraged at the incident, and the Porte accused the Venetians of deliberate collusion with the Knights, which the Venetians vehemently denied. With the hawkish party being then dominant in the Ottoman court,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> the incident was seen as a perfect pretext for war with a weakened Venice.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Despite a long period of negotiations, which lasted until well into 1645, and against the objections of the Grand Vizier <a href="Sultanzade_Semiz_Mehmed_Pasha" title="wikilink">Sultanzade Mehmed Pasha</a>,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> war was decided upon. An expedition was quickly assembled with over 50,000 troops and (reputedly) 416 vessels, under <a href="Kapudan_Pasha" title="wikilink">Kapudan Pasha</a> Silahdar Yusuf Pasha, the Sultan's son-in-law. The Ottoman armada sailed from the Dardanelles on 30 April, heading towards the harbor of <a href="Navarino" class="uri" title="wikilink">Navarino</a> in the <a href="Peloponnese" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peloponnese</a>, where it remained for three weeks.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The fleet's target was not announced, but the Ottomans, in order to allay Venetian fears, implied it would be Malta.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>The Venetians were indeed fooled by the Ottoman subterfuge and were taken by surprise at the arrival of the Ottoman fleet at Crete on 23 June 1645.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Despite the efforts of the recently appointed <em><a href="provveditore" class="uri" title="wikilink">provveditore</a> generale</em>, Andrea Corner, the Venetian defenses were still in a bad state.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The island's fortifications were substantial, but they had been long neglected, and much effort was put into repairing them.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Anxious about Ottoman preparations, the Republic reinforced Crete in late 1644 with 2,500 troops and provisions, and began arming its fleet, while assistance was promised in the event of war by the Pope and <a href="Tuscany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tuscany</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> However, the local Greek population was not well-disposed towards the Venetians, something that would prove to be of critical importance, not only were the Ottomans thus able to quickly establish control over the countryside, but in later years, when the Ottomans in the island were practically cut off from seaborne supplies, only the local produce, provided by the Greek population, sustained them.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The Ottomans first landed 15 miles west of Canea (<a href="Chania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chania</a>), where the local militia fled before them.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> They then attacked the small island fortress of St. Todero, the commander of which, the <a href="Istria" title="wikilink">Istrian</a> Blasio Zulian, blew himself, the fortress and its garrison up rather than let it fall to the Ottomans. The Ottoman army next advanced to the city of Canea itself, which fell on <a href="22_August" title="wikilink">22 August</a>, after a siege that lasted for 56 days.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> At the same time, however, the Venetians were strengthened, as the promised help started to arrive in the form of galleys from the Papal States, Tuscany, Malta and Naples. In September, the Ottoman fleet was in disarray, but the allied Christian fleet, under the cautious command of <a href="Niccol&lt;U+00F2&gt;_Ludovisi" title="wikilink">Niccol&lt;U+00F2&gt; Ludovisi</a>, the Pope's nephew, failed to exploit the opportunity for a decisive strike.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> When the Christian forces finally moved to retake Canea on 1 October, with a fleet of about 90 ships, the stout Turkish defense and the Allies' lack of cooperation doomed the attack. Soon thereafter, the Venetian allies returned to their bases.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>In November, Silahdar Yusuf Pasha left behind a strong garrison and returned to Constantinople for the winter. There however, he fell foul of the Sultan and was executed.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Nevertheless, Ottoman preparations continued with a view to renewing and expanding the war, while the Venetians were frantically trying to raise money and men, and attempting to induce other European powers to join them against the Ottomans. However, as most of Europe was locked into the fierce antagonisms of the <a href="Thirty_Years&#39;_War" title="wikilink">Thirty Years' War</a>, their pleas fell mostly on deaf ears.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The Venetians were hard pressed by the financial demands of the war: aside from taxes placed on the Italian mainland possessions (the <em><a href="Domini_di_Terraferma" title="wikilink">Terraferma</a></em>), they resorted to the sale of nobility titles and state offices to fill their war coffer.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> To lead the effort against the Ottomans, the Senate initially appointed the 80 year-old <a href="Doge_of_Venice" title="wikilink">doge</a> <a href="Francesco_Erizzo" title="wikilink">Francesco Erizzo</a>, but after his death in early 1646, he was replaced by Giovanni Cappello (73 years old) as Captain General of the Sea.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Cappello's performance in 1646 was distinctly lackluster: he failed to interdict the arrival of Ottoman reinforcements under Kara Musa Pasha in June (see <a href="#The_naval_war" title="wikilink">below</a>),<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and an attack on the Turkish fleet at Chania Bay in August failed, as did his attempt to break the Ottoman blockade of Rettimo (<a href="Rethymno" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rethymno</a>). As a result, the city fell on 20 October, while the citadel held out until 13 November.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> During the winter of 1646/1647, both sides suffered from an outbreak of <a href="plague" class="uri" title="wikilink">plague</a>, and throughout the spring of 1647, operations did not make much headway. In mid-June however, a small Ottoman force routed a larger body of Venetian mercenaries. This Ottoman success paved the way for Deli H&lt;U+00FC&gt;seyin Pasha, the local commander, to conquer the eastern half of the island, with the exception of the fortress of <a href="Siteia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Siteia</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The Venetians and the local population suffered some grievous losses: it is estimated that by 1648, almost 40% of the Cretan population had perished of disease or warfare,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> and in 1677, the island's pre-war population of ca. 260,000 had dropped to an estimated 80,000.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> By the beginning of 1648, all of Crete, with the exception of Candia and a few strongholds like the island of <a href="Grambusa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grambusa</a>, was in Ottoman hands.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-siege-of-candia-begins">The Siege of Candia begins</h3>

<p>The siege began in May 1648. The Turks spent three months investing the city, which included cutting off the water supply. Eventually, it would last until 1669, the second longest siege in history after the siege of <a href="Ceuta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ceuta</a> by the <a href="Moors" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moors</a> under <a href="Moulay_Ismail" title="wikilink">Moulay Ismail</a> (1694&lt;U+2013&gt;1727).<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The Ottoman besiegers were adversely affected by the bad supply situation caused by the activity of the Christian fleets in the Aegean, who intercepted Ottoman convoys carrying supplies and reinforcements to the island.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In addition, the overall Ottoman war effort was severely hampered by increased domestic instability caused by Sultan <a href="Ibrahim_I" title="wikilink">Ibrahim</a>'s erratic policies and his summary execution of leading state officials. It ultimately led to his deposition in favor of his son <a href="Mehmed_IV" title="wikilink">Mehmed IV</a>, ushering in a further period of confusion within the Ottoman government.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>The lack of supplies had forced the Ottoman commander H&lt;U+00FC&gt;seyin Pasha to lift the siege in early 1649, but it was renewed for a short period of two months after the arrival of the Ottoman fleet in June.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The Ottomans assailed the fortifications, exploding over 70 <a href="Mining_(military)" title="wikilink">mines</a>, but the defenders held firm. The Turks lost over 1,000 men, and the subsequent withdrawal of 1,500 <a href="Janissaries" class="uri" title="wikilink">Janissaries</a> and the lack of any further reinforcements over the course of 1650 left H&lt;U+00FC&gt;seyin Pasha with little option but to continue maintaining as tight a blockade as possible.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The Ottomans strengthened their positions with the construction of three forts in the Canea area, and the arrival of reinforcements in late 1650 allowed them to keep up their tight blockade.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Despite the Venetian blockade of the Dardanelles and the political turmoil at the Ottoman court, the Ottoman forces were kept well supplied enough to sustain themselves, although too weak to engage in offensive actions against Candia itself. In 1653, the Ottomans took the island fortress of Selino in Suda Bay, and San Todero, captured a few years previously, was refortified.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The Venetian naval successes over the next few years further reduced the offensive ability of the Ottoman army in Crete, but the blockade of Candia continued, and the Ottomans retained possession of their other conquests on the island, until the arrival of a new Ottoman expeditionary force in 1666.</p>

<p>The first Venetian operation was an attempt to blockade the <a href="Dardanelles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dardanelles</a> in 1646. In an effort to interdict the supplies headed to the Ottoman forces in Crete, a force of 23 Venetian ships under Tommaso Morosini scoured the Aegean for Ottoman shipping, and attempted to capture the strategically important island of <a href="Tenedos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tenedos</a> at the entrance of the Dardanelles. The Kapudan Pasha <a href="Kara_Musa_Pasha" title="wikilink">Kara Musa</a> led a fleet of 80 warships against the Venetians, but his fleet was driven back into the Dardanelles on <a href="Action_of_26_May_1646" title="wikilink">26 May</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> However, the blockading fleet was unable to stop the next exit of the Ottoman fleet on 4 June, when the lack of wind enabled the Ottoman galleys to evade the Venetian sailing ships. The Ottomans were thus able to land new troops and supplies on Crete unopposed.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The efforts of the Venetian fleet to counter the Ottoman land operations in Crete likewise failed, through a combination of timidity on behalf of their commanders, the delays in payment for the crews, and the effects of a widespread plague.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>On 27 January 1647, the Venetians lost Tommaso Morosini, when his ship was forced to face the entire Ottoman fleet of 45 galleys. In the ensuing fight, Morosini was killed, but managed to cause significant casualties to the Ottomans, including Kara Musa Pasha himself. The ship itself was rescued by the timely arrival of the Venetian fleet under the new Captain General, Giovanni Battista Grimani. This stand-off, where a single ship had caused such damage and casualties to the entire Ottoman fleet, was a major blow to Ottoman morale.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Despite some successes like a raid in <a href="&lt;U+00C7&gt;e&lt;U+015F&gt;me" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C7&gt;e&lt;U+015F&gt;me</a>, the remainder of the year was a failure for the Venetians, as several attempts to blockade Turkish harbors failed to stem the flow of supplies and reinforcements to Crete.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

Kara Murad succeeded in evading the Venetians for the remainder of the year, with both fleets sailing back and forth in the Aegean, before returning to the Dardanelles in September due to agitation among the fleet's Janissaries.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The final months of 1654 were marked by a significant change in the Venetian leadership: Mocenigo died at Candia, and was succeeded as acting Captain General of the Sea by <a href="Francesco_Morosini" title="wikilink">Francesco Morosini</a>, who had distinguished himself in the previous battles.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>

Reinforced by Papal and Maltese ships, Mocenigo sailed to the Dardanelles, awaiting the renewed sally of the Ottoman fleet, which came on 17 July.

Morosini also resumed his tactic of attacking Ottoman strongholds: a siege of the island of Santa Maura (<a href="Lefkada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lefkada</a>) in August 1658 failed, but in 1659, the Venetians, aided by the <a href="Maniots" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maniots</a>, sacked <a href="Kalamata" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kalamata</a> in the Peloponnese, followed by Torone in the <a href="Chalcidice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chalcidice</a>, <a href="Karystos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Karystos</a> in <a href="Euboea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Euboea</a>, and <a href="&lt;U+00C7&gt;e&lt;U+015F&gt;me" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C7&gt;e&lt;U+015F&gt;me</a>.

<p>In the meantime, war-weariness had set in among the Venetians, who suffered from the disruption in trade.

<p>This support did indeed soon materialize, when individuals or whole companies of men from across Western Europe volunteered for the Republic's army, while Christian rulers also felt obliged to provide men, supplies and ships.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> The first French contingent of 4,200 men under Prince Almerigo d'Este arrived in April 1660, along with further contingents of German mercenaries, troops from Savoy, and Maltese, Tuscan and French ships.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Despite this increase in strength, Morosini's operations in 1660 were a failure: an assault on Canea in August succeeded in taking the outlying fortifications but failed to retake the city itself; similarly, an attack against the Ottoman siege lines at Candia in September achieved some success, but did not break the Ottoman siege.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Following the death of Prince d'Este at <a href="Naxos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Naxos</a> shortly after, the French contingent returned home, followed soon after by a disheartened Morosini, who was succeeded by his kinsman Giorgio.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> In 1661, Giorgio Morosini scored a few minor successes: he broke an Ottoman blockade of Tinos, and, pursuing the Ottoman fleet, defeated it off <a href="Action_of_27_August_1661" title="wikilink">Milos</a>. The next few years however were relatively idle.

On 5 September 1669, the city was surrendered to the Ottomans, while the survivors of the garrison, the citizens and their treasures were evacuated.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a><a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> On his own initiative, Morosini concluded a permanent peace agreement with the Ottomans, which, under the circumstances, was relatively generous: Venice would retain the Aegean islands of <a href="Tinos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tinos</a> and Kythera and the isolated island fortresses of <a href="Spinalonga" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spinalonga</a>, <a href="Grambusa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grambusa</a> and <a href="Souda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Souda</a> off the Cretan coast, as well as the gains made in Dalmatia.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a><a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-war-in-dalmatia">The war in Dalmatia</h3>
<p>The <a href="Dalmatia" title="wikilink">Dalmatian</a> front was a separate theater of operations, which was involved in the early phase of the war. The conditions there were almost reverse to those in Crete: for the Ottomans, it was too far away and relatively insignificant, while the Venetians operated near their own bases of supply and had undisputed control of the sea, being thus able to easily reinforce their coastal strongholds.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> In addition, and again unlike Crete, the Venetians enjoyed the support of much of the local population, particularly the <em><a href="Morlachs" title="wikilink">Morlacchi</a></em>.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> The Ottomans launched a large-scale attack in 1646, and made some significant gains, including the capture of the islands of <a href="Veglia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Veglia</a>, <a href="Pag_(island)" title="wikilink">Pag</a> and <a href="Cres" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cres</a>,<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> and most importantly, the supposedly impregnable fortress of Novigrad, which surrendered after only two days of bombardment on 4 July.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> The Turks were now in a position to threaten the two main Venetian strongholds in Dalmatia, <a href="Zara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zara</a> and <a href="Split" class="uri" title="wikilink">Split</a>.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> In the next year however, the tide turned, as the Venetian commander Leonardo Foscolo seized several forts, retook Novigrad, temporarily captured the fortress of <a href="Knin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Knin</a> and took <a href="Clissa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Clissa</a>,<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a><a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> while a month-long siege of the fortress of <a href="&lt;U+0160&gt;ibenik" title="wikilink">Sebenico</a> by the Ottomans in August and September failed.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> During the next few years, military operations stalled because of an outbreak of famine and plague amongst the Venetians at Zara, while both sides focused their resources in the Aegean area.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> As other fronts took priority for the Ottomans, no further operations occurred in the Dalmatian theater.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> Peace in 1669 found the <a href="Republic_of_Venice" title="wikilink">Most Serene Republic</a> with significant gains in Dalmatia, its territory tripled, and its control of the Adriatic thus secured.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>

<p>The surrender of Candia ended the four and a half centuries of <a href="History_of_Crete#Venetian_and_Ottoman_Crete" title="wikilink">Venetian rule</a> in Crete, and brought the Ottoman Empire to its temporary territorial zenith.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> At the same time however, the cost and casualties incurred during this prolonged war contributed greatly to the decline of the Ottoman state during the latter 17th century.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> On the other hand, Venice had lost its greatest and most prosperous colony, its pre-eminent trading position in the Mediterranean had diminished,<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> and its treasury was exhausted, having spent some 4,253,000 ducats on the defense of Candia alone.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> To all this, the Dalmatian gains were insufficient compensation. Upon his return to Venice in 1670, Morosini was tried on charges of insubordination and treason, but was acquitted. Fifteen years later, he would lead the Venetian forces in the <a href="Morean_War" title="wikilink">Morean War</a>, where the Republic attempted, for the last time, to reverse its losses and reestablish itself as one of the major powers of the Eastern Mediterranean.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a><a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> During the course of that war, in 1692, a Venetian fleet attempted to retake Candia, but failed.
