<p><strong>Kimball Bent</strong> (24 August 1837 &lt;U+2013&gt; 22 May 1916), also known as &quot;Kimble Bent&quot;, was a soldier and adventurer, who deserted from the British Army during the <a href="New_Zealand_Wars" title="wikilink">New Zealand Wars</a> and lived for the reminder of his life among the Maori people of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Bent was born in <a href="Eastport,_Maine" title="wikilink">Eastport, Maine</a> USA. He ran away to sea at 17 and spent three years travelling the Atlantic seaboard as a sailor/ gunner in the US Navy. He returned to Eastport but was restless and sailed to <a href="Liverpool,_England" title="wikilink">Liverpool, England</a>. Penniless and seeking adventure on 18 October 1859 he enlisted in the <a href="57th_(West_Middlesex)_Regiment_of_Foot" title="wikilink">57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot</a> in the <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a>. He served in <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a> and his unit was posted to <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> in 1861. His record was dubious, and he was repeatedly disciplined for various military infractions including disobedience and drunkenness. This discipline included a prison sentence in <a href="Wellington" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wellington</a>, and receiving lashes in front of his company. Bent accordingly decided to desert in June 1865 while serving in <a href="Taranaki_Region" title="wikilink">Taranaki</a>.</p>
<p>Bent was found by a local <a href="M&lt;U+0101&gt;ori_people" title="wikilink">M&lt;U+0101&gt;ori</a> chief of the <a href="Ng&lt;U+0101&gt;ti_Ruanui" title="wikilink">Ng&lt;U+0101&gt;ti Ruanui</a> <a href="iwi" class="uri" title="wikilink">iwi</a> in South Taranaki and eventually became accepted as a part of the local tribe. He fell in with <a href="Titokowaru" class="uri" title="wikilink">Titokowaru</a>'s followers in 1867 and fought with them against the colonists in what has become known as <a href="Titokowaru&#39;s_War" title="wikilink">Titokowaru's War</a> until their eventual defeat in 1869.</p>
<p>Bent then went into hiding first in the backblocks of Taranaki and later in Wairau, Blenheim. He spent his remaining years working in several trades including as a builder, fisherman, horticulturist, tattooist, traditional healer using Maori medicine and even a confectioner. He remained a wanted deserter with a reward on his head for many years, but eventually the authorities stopped looking for him. In 1903 he was rediscovered, and a book was written about his life by <a href="James_Cowan_(New_Zealand_writer)" title="wikilink">James Cowan</a>. Entitled <em>The adventures of Kimble Bent: a story of wild life in the New Zealand bush,</em>, it was something of sensation at the time.</p>
<p>He died in Wairau Hospital on 22 May 1916.</p>
<p>More recently, his tale has been fictionalised by New Zealand author <a href="Maurice_Shadbolt" title="wikilink">Maurice Shadbolt</a> in his 1990 historical novel <em><a href="Monday&#39;s_Warriors" title="wikilink">Monday's Warriors</a></em> and in the 2011 graphic novel, <em>Kimble Bent Malcontent: The Wild Adventures of a Runaway Soldier in Old-Time New Zealand</em> by Chris Grosz.</p>
