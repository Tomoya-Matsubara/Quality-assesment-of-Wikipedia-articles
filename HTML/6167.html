<p>&quot;Donnie Fatso&quot; was written by Chris Cluess and directed by Ralph Sosa. Critics were polarized with the episode, with criticism stemming from its main plot and cultural references.

<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>Homer and Marge wake on <a href="New_Year&#39;s_Day" title="wikilink">New Year's Day</a> with hangovers after the family's <a href="New_Year&#39;s_Eve" title="wikilink">New Year's Eve</a> celebration. Homer takes out the garbage but <a href="Chief_Wiggum" title="wikilink">Chief Wiggum</a> and his cops arrive and inform Homer that the town has approved new <a href="dumb_law" title="wikilink">dumb laws</a> and Homer racks up a series of spurious <a href="Fine_(penalty)" title="wikilink">fines</a>. With fines of $1000, <a href="Moe_Szyslak" title="wikilink">Moe</a> suggests Homer <a href="bribe" class="uri" title="wikilink">bribe</a> an official, but Wiggum catches him in the act and arrests him. After being sentenced to ten years in jail, Wiggum takes pity on Homer and suggests he talk with an FBI investigator who offers to reduce his jail time if Homer agrees to go <a href="undercover" class="uri" title="wikilink">undercover</a> as an informant to investigate <a href="Fat_Tony" title="wikilink">Fat Tony</a>. Meanwhile, Marge becomes upset by Homer's &quot;disappearance&quot;.</p>
<p>After freeing Homer from jail, Fat Tony lets Homer spend time with his gang. Impressed with Homer's attitude, Fat Tony decides to test him. His first order was to <a href="Arson" title="wikilink">burn</a> down Moe's Tavern (a revenge for the latter's rudeness towards Tony when he mistakes Tony's telephone call <a href="Bart_Simpson" title="wikilink">for a prank</a>), but fortunately, Homer does not need to lift a finger as Moe already has done this in order to avoid sanitary inspection (&quot;<em>it's that or put in a ladies room!</em>&quot;). Homer is accepted into the mafia family and forges a special bond with Fat Tony. However, internal conflict sets in as the mafia was attempting to import Belgian guns. Fat Tony later finds out that Homer is an informant for the government and, emotionally unable to endure the betrayal, dies of heart attack.</p>
<p>Marge is pleased that Homer has his sentence scrapped and is able to come back home. Unable to bear the guilt from being associated with the death of Fat Tony, Homer decides to apologise to him at his grave, only to have Fat Tony's cousin Fit Tony kidnap him to settle a score. However, after Homer explains that he does not care about death, they have a conversation and come to the conclusion that the real culprits for killing Fat Tony were the government agents who spied on them. Fit Tony then assumes the family's management, but the stress of his new position makes him eat much more than the normal and he ends up becoming the new Fat Tony (another meta referential joke about the Simpsons' <a href="status_quo" title="wikilink">status quo</a>).</p>

In July 2010, it was announced that <a href="Jon_Hamm" title="wikilink">Jon Hamm</a> would make a guest appearance in the episode as an agent for the <a href="FBI" class="uri" title="wikilink">FBI</a>. In his interview with <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em>, showrunner <a href="Al_Jean" title="wikilink">Al Jean</a> was pleased with Hamm's performance, opining: &quot;You gave him one note and he immediately did twelve great things with it. He was really funny. And handsome. He had it all.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Hamm stated that appearing on the show was &quot;an incredible experience&quot;. In his interview with <em><a href="Access_Hollywood" title="wikilink">Access Hollywood</a></em>, he continued, &quot;I got to work on <em>The Simpsons</em>, which I watched for 20 years and the show is still fresh and still funny and the characters still resonate. It&lt;U+2019&gt;s one of the best shows on television. It was an honor to be asked to be a part of it.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="Joe_Mantegna" title="wikilink">Joe Mantegna</a> returned as <a href="Fat_Tony" title="wikilink">Fat Tony</a>, and voiced Fat Tony's cousin Fit Tony.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;Donnie Fatso&quot; features several references to music, film, media, and other pop culture phenomenon. The episode's plot and title are parodical to that of the film <em><a href="Donnie_Brasco_(film)" title="wikilink">Donnie Brasco</a></em>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> At the end of the episode, Homer's monologue serves as a homage to monologue of Henry Hill in <em><a href="Goodfellas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Goodfellas</a></em>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Similarly, the parodying monologue is set to <a href="Sid_Vicious" title="wikilink">Sid Vicious</a>' version of &quot;<a href="My_Way_(song)" title="wikilink">My Way</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Near the end of the episode, Fit Tony narrowly avoids a <a href="car_bomb" title="wikilink">car bomb</a>, a scene similar to that in <em><a href="Casino_(film)" title="wikilink">Casino</a></em>. The final scene between Fat Tony and Homer is reminiscent to that of the television show <em><a href="Wiseguy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wiseguy</a></em>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>The episode attained mixed receptions from television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of <em><a href="The_A.V._Club" title="wikilink">The A.V. Club</a></em> gave the episode a 'C' grade, scoring lower than &quot;<a href="Road_to_the_North_Pole" title="wikilink">Road to the North Pole</a>&quot; of <em>Family Guy</em> and &quot;<a href="For_Whom_the_Sleigh_Bell_Tolls" title="wikilink">For Whom the Sleigh Bell Tolls</a>&quot; of <em>American Dad</em>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> VanDerWerff felt that the episode was &quot;fairly lazy&quot;, and commented that the main plot was &quot;too much of a mob movie pastiche.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Similarly, Ciara Moyner of <em>Daemon's TV</em> expressed that various parts of the episode were entertaining, but concluded that it was &quot;ultimately forgettable&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Eric Hochberger of <em>TV Fanatic</em> criticized the humor of the episode, opining that &quot;for an episode with such an overdone story, we could have forgiven things if it were at least funnier.&quot; He continued: &quot;Unfortunately, there just weren't enough jokes to make the episode worth it.&quot; In conclusion of his review, Hochberger gave &quot;Donnie Fatso&quot; a 2.5 out of 5 stars.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Critics were also polarized with the conclusion of Fat Tony, and the addition of Fit Tony. Moyner was apathetic towards the writers' decision to kill off Fat Tony, opining: &quot;It's hard to feel sad about a character who overstayed his welcome by appearing for more than five minutes on screen.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> writer Darren Franich named Fat Tony's death the ninth Best TV Character Death of 2010, writing, &quot;give the writers some credit for doing something different: In the middle of an otherwise straightforward mob-themed episode, they actually went ahead and killed off Fat Tony, a character who was first introduced almost twenty years ago.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
