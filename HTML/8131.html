<p><strong>Imad Fayez Mughniyah</strong> (7 December 1962 &lt;U+2013&gt; 12 February 2008), also <a href="transliterate" title="wikilink">transliterated</a> <strong>Mughniyya</strong>, <strong>Mughniyeh</strong>, <strong>Mogniyah</strong> (), <a href="Pseudonym" title="wikilink">alias</a> <strong>al-Hajj Radwan</strong> (<big>&lt;U+0627&gt;&lt;U+0644&gt;&lt;U+062D&gt;&lt;U+0627&gt;&lt;U+062C&gt; &lt;U+0631&gt;&lt;U+0636&gt;&lt;U+0648&gt;&lt;U+0627&gt;&lt;U+0646&gt;</big>), was a senior member of <a href="Lebanon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lebanon</a>'s <a href="Hezbollah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hezbollah</a> organisation. He was alternatively described as the head of its security section, a senior intelligence official and as one of the founders of the organisation. Mugniyah has been associated with the <a href="1983_Beirut_barracks_bombing" title="wikilink">Beirut barracks bombing</a> and <a href="1983_United_States_embassy_bombing" title="wikilink">US embassy bombings</a>, both of which took place in 1983 and killed over 350, as well as the kidnapping of dozens of foreigners in Lebanon in the 1980s. He was indicted in <a href="Argentina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Argentina</a> for his alleged role in the 1992 <a href="Israeli_embassy_attack_in_Buenos_Aires" title="wikilink">Israeli embassy attack in Buenos Aires</a>. The highest-profile attacks for which it is claimed he is responsible took place in the early 1980s, shortly after the founding of Hezbollah. He is thought to have killed more <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> citizens than any other militant before the <a href="2001_US_attacks" title="wikilink">2001 US attacks</a>, and the bombings and kidnappings he is alleged to have organized are credited with all but eliminating the <a href="US_military" title="wikilink">US military</a> presence in Lebanon in the 1980s.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Information about him is limited. He is reported by the US <a href="FBI" class="uri" title="wikilink">FBI</a> to have used the alias of <em>Hajj</em>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and to have been called <em>Abu Dokhan</em>, Arabic for &quot;smoke-bearer&quot; or &quot;father of smoke&quot;—according to US fiction writer Richard Couch because of his skill at disappearing when being pursued. Mughniyah was included in the European Union's list of wanted terrorists.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and had a US$5 million bounty on the <a href="FBI_Most_Wanted_Terrorists" title="wikilink">FBI Most Wanted Terrorists</a> list.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Imad Mughniyah was killed on 12 February 2008 by a <a href="car_bomb" title="wikilink">car bomb</a>, planted inside the driver's <a href="headrest" class="uri" title="wikilink">headrest</a>,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> around 11:00 pm local time in the <a href="Kfar_Suseh" title="wikilink">Kfar Suseh</a> neighborhood of <a href="Damascus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Damascus</a>, <a href="Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syria</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> As Mughniyah passed the car on foot, the bomb was detonated.

<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Mughniyah was born in Tayr Dibba to a family of poor farmers who harvested olives and lemons in the orchards of Lebanon's southern Shi'a heartland.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> <a href="CIA" class="uri" title="wikilink">CIA</a> South Group records state that Mughniyah lived in Ayn Al-Dilbah, a slum in South <a href="Beirut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beirut</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Mughniyeh is described as having been a popular boy and a &quot;natural entertainer&quot; who cracked jokes at family weddings and &quot;worked the crowd with a confidence unusual for a youth his age.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Mughniyah became active in the Palestinian Fatah movement at an early age. He was discovered by fellow Lebanese Ali Abu Hassan Deeb (who would later become a leader in Hizbullah) and quickly rose through the ranks of the movement.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In the mid-1970s, Mugniyah organized the &quot;Student Brigade,&quot; a unit of 100 young men which became part of <a href="Yasser_Arafat" title="wikilink">Yasser Arafat</a>'s elite <a href="Force_17" title="wikilink">Force 17</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Mughniyah temporarily left Fatah in 1981 due to differences of opinion on the regime of <a href="Saddam_Hussein" title="wikilink">Saddam Hussein</a>. Mughniyah was a Shiite and deeply religious and was upset by the murder of the Iraqi Grand Ayatullah <a href="Muhammad_Baqir_as-Sadr" title="wikilink">Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr</a> in 1980 as well as a previous attempt by the Iraqi intelligence on the life of Lebanese Ayatullah <a href="Muhammad_Hussein_Fadlallah" title="wikilink">Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Fatah was formally in alliance the <a href="Lebanese_National_Movement" title="wikilink">Lebanese National Movement</a>, which included the Lebanese pro-Iraqi branch of the <a href="Ba&#39;ath_Party" title="wikilink">Ba&lt;U+2019&gt;th party</a>. Mughniyah and some of his Lebanese Shiite comrades were forced to leave Fatah after engaging in armed confrontations with Ba&lt;U+2019&gt;th party activists. They had previously organized a body guard unit for Ayatullah Fadlallah and other Shiite clerics in Lebanon. Mughniyah accompanied Ayatullah Fadlallah on a <a href="Hajj" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hajj</a> pilgrimage in 1980 and thus earned his Hajj title.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Mughniyeh was a student in the engineering department at the <a href="American_University_of_Beirut" title="wikilink">American University of Beirut</a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> in 1981 when the United States gave the &quot;green light&quot; for Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon in pursuit of the <a href="Palestine_Liberation_Organization" title="wikilink">Palestine Liberation Organization</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>When Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 Mughniyah was in Iran but hurried back to Beirut where he rejoined Fatah and participated in the defence of West Beirut and was wounded in the fighting. After the withdrawal of PLO forces from Beirut in September 1982 Mughniyah acquired an important position in the nascent resistance to the Israeli occupation due to his knowledge of arms cashes left behind by the Palestinians. He remained a Fatah member during this period but also worked with other factions, such as the leftist Lebanese National Movement and Islamic resistance groups. Mughniyah remained a member of Fatah until 1984 when he joined the newly created <a href="Islamic_Resistance" title="wikilink">Islamic Resistance</a> of the Hezbullah. He remained however close to Fatah leader <a href="Khalil_al-Wazir" title="wikilink">Khalil al-Wazir</a> (Abu Jihad) until the latter&lt;U+2019&gt;s death in 1988. He also remained deeply committed to the Palestine cause throughout his life and apparently founded a secret &quot;Committee for Elimination of Israel&quot; (&lt;U+0644&gt;&lt;U+062C&gt;&lt;U+0646&gt;&lt;U+0629&gt; &lt;U+0644&gt;&lt;U+0625&gt;&lt;U+0632&gt;&lt;U+0627&gt;&lt;U+0644&gt;&lt;U+0629&gt; &lt;U+0625&gt;&lt;U+0633&gt;&lt;U+0631&gt;&lt;U+0627&gt;&lt;U+0626&gt;&lt;U+064A&gt;&lt;U+0644&gt;) inside the Hizbullah in 2000. In later years, and especially after the Oslo accords, Mughniyah and the Hizbullah sided with the more militant Palestinian factions such as <a href="Hamas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hamas</a> and the <a href="Islamic_Jihad_Movement_in_Palestine" title="wikilink">Islamic Jihad</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Mughniyah worked as the bodyguard for Sayyed Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, a spiritual mentor to many in Lebanon's Shi'a community whose political consciousness was on the rise. Fadlallah held no formal political role, &quot;opposed violence and sectarian division, and defied growing Iranian influence in Lebanon.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="personal-life">Personal life</h3>
<p>In 1983, Mughniyah married to his cousin Saada Badr Al Din who is the sister of <a href="Mustafa_Badr_Al_Din" title="wikilink">Mustafa Badr Al Din</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Mughniyah had two children from this marriage: Fatima Mugniyah (born August 1984) and Mustafa Mugniyah (born January 1987).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In September 1991, Mugniyah&lt;U+2019&gt;s wife and children were sent to Tehran for security reasons.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="allegations">Allegations</h2>
<p>Mughniyah was accused of terrorist attacks in the 1980s and 1990s, primarily against <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> and <a href="Israel" title="wikilink">Israeli</a> targets. These allegations include the 18 April 1983 <a href="April_1983_US_Embassy_bombing" title="wikilink">bombing of the United States embassy</a> in <a href="Beirut,_Lebanon" title="wikilink">Beirut, Lebanon</a>, which killed 63 people including 17 Americans. Agreement is not universal on Mughniyah's involvement as <a href="Caspar_Weinberger" title="wikilink">Caspar Weinberger</a>, the Secretary of Defense at the time, told <a href="Public_Broadcasting_Service" title="wikilink">PBS</a> in 2001, &quot;We still do not have the actual knowledge of who did the bombing of the Marine barracks at the Beirut Airport, and we certainly didn't then.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Mughniyah was fingered as the mastermind of the 23 October 1983 simultaneous <a href="truck_bomb" title="wikilink">truck bombings</a> against French paratroopers and the <a href="1983_Beirut_barracks_bombing" title="wikilink">U.S. Marine barracks</a>, attacks which killed 58 French soldiers and 241 Marines.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> On 20 September 1984, he is alleged to have attacked the US embassy annex building. The United States indicted him (and his collaborator, Hassan Izz al-Din) for the 14 June 1985 <a href="Aircraft_hijacking" title="wikilink">hijacking</a> of <a href="TWA_Flight_847" title="wikilink">TWA Flight 847</a>, which resulted in the death of <a href="U.S._Navy" title="wikilink">U.S. Navy</a> diver <a href="Robert_Stethem" title="wikilink">Robert Stethem</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Reportedly, Mughniyah and his men beat Stethem for hours, before killing him and dumping his body onto the tarmac.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Mughniyah was also linked to numerous <a href="Lebanon_hostage_crisis" title="wikilink">kidnappings of Westerners</a> in Beirut through the 1980s, most notably that of <a href="Terry_A._Anderson" title="wikilink">Terry Anderson</a>, <a href="Terry_Waite" title="wikilink">Terry Waite</a>, and <a href="William_Francis_Buckley" title="wikilink">William Francis Buckley</a>, who was the CIA station chief in Beirut. Some of these individuals were later killed, such as Buckley, who was hideously tortured and eventually murdered.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The remainder were released at various times with the last one, Terry Anderson, released in 1991. It is also believed that he took advantage of his status as a student in the <a href="American_University_of_Beirut" title="wikilink">American University of Beirut</a> (AUB) to enable him to assassinate Malcolm Kerr, president of the AUB, on campus in 1984. His stay at AUB as an engineering student was financed by a political organisation. Mugniyah has also been tied to the <a href="Khobar_Towers_bombing" title="wikilink">Khobar Towers bombing</a> in 1996, which killed 19 Americans and one Saudi citizen.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>On 30 September 1985, Mughniyah allegedly organized the kidnapping of four diplomats from the Soviet Embassy in Beirut, one of whom he soon personally killed. The result of this kidnapping was Soviet pressure on Syria to stop its operations in Northern Lebanon in exchange for release of the remaining three hostages.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> On 8 March 1985, the CIA carried out a <a href="1985_Beirut_car_bombing" title="wikilink">reprisal operation</a> funded by the Saudis, for the Marine barracks bombing of 1983, in which they attempted to kill Fadlallah by car-bombing. The cleric escaped harm, but the huge explosion wounded 200 and killed 62 in the poor Shi'a neighbourhood where he lived. Among the dead were Imad Mughniya's brother and some of Fadlallah's bodyguards and close friends.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> <a href="Roger_Morris_(American_writer)" title="wikilink">Roger Morris</a> claims that this was a &quot;turning point&quot; in Mughniyeh's life and that it was after this event that he &quot;joined the terrorist arm of the increasingly militant political impulse among Lebanon's Shi'ah from which Hezbollah soon emerged, and as the resistance movement's chief of security and intelligence, he joined one of history's more vicious chain reactions.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In 1993, Mughniyah was introduced to <a href="Osama_Bin_Laden" title="wikilink">Osama Bin Laden</a> by <a href="Al_Qaeda" title="wikilink">Al Qaeda</a> operative Ali Muhammad in <a href="Somali" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somali</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Mughniyah was formally charged by <a href="Argentina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Argentina</a> due to his involvement in the 17 March 1992 <a href="Israeli_Embassy_Attack_in_Buenos_Aires" title="wikilink">bombings of the Israeli embassy</a> in <a href="Buenos_Aires" title="wikilink">Buenos Aires</a>, which killed 29 and the <a href="AMIA_Bombing" title="wikilink">AMIA cultural building</a> in July 1994, killing 86 people.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> He has also been accused of orchestrating the 2000 capture of three Israeli soldiers in the northern part of Israel and the kidnapping of Israeli businessman <a href="Elchanan_Tenenbaum" title="wikilink">Elchanan Tenenbaum</a>, and of killing eight soldiers and abducting two in the <a href="2006_Lebanon_War" title="wikilink">2006 Lebanon War</a>.</p>
<p>While the long international hunt for Mughniyah produced many allegations, they were denied or dismissed by Hezbollah. In a July 2003 interview, Hezbollah leader Sheikh <a href="Hassan_Nasrallah" title="wikilink">Hassan Nasrallah</a> told <em><a href="Time_Magazine" title="wikilink">Time Magazine</a></em> that the US accusations against Mughniyah were &quot;just accusations,&quot; and he questioned whether they could provide evidence to condemn Mughniyah. Nasrallah also stated that, &quot;Hajj Imad is among the best freedom fighters in the Lebanese arena. He had a very important role during the occupation [of southern Lebanon by Israel]. But as for his relationship with Hezbollah, we maintain the tradition of not discussing names.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>According to <a href="Robert_Baer" title="wikilink">Robert Baer</a>, &quot;Mughniyah is probably the most intelligent, most capable operative we&lt;U+2019&gt;ve ever run across, including the KGB or anybody else. He enters by one door, exits by another, changes his cars daily, never makes appointments on a telephone, never is predictable. He only uses people that are related to him that he can trust. He doesn&lt;U+2019&gt;t just recruit people.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> He was described as &quot;tall, slender, well-dressed and handsome ... penetrating eyes,&quot; speaking some English but better French.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="organizational-affiliation">Organizational affiliation</h2>
<p>Mugniyah has been allegedly linked to <a href="Palestinian_people" title="wikilink">Palestinian</a> operations such as the <a href="Karine_A" title="wikilink">Karine A</a> incident in 2002, where the <a href="Palestinian_Authority" title="wikilink">Palestinian Authority</a> was accused of importing fifty tons of weapons. He was a member of <em><a href="Force_17" title="wikilink">Force 17</a></em>, an armed branch of the <a href="Fatah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fatah</a> movement charged with providing security for <a href="Yasser_Arafat" title="wikilink">Yasser Arafat</a> and other prominent <a href="PLO" class="uri" title="wikilink">PLO</a> officials.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>In mid-February 1997, the pro-Israeli <a href="South_Lebanese_Army" title="wikilink">South Lebanese Army</a> radio station reported that Iran's intelligence service had dispatched Mughniyah to Lebanon to directly supervise the reorganisation of Hezbollah's security apparatus concerned with Palestinian affairs in Lebanon and to work as a security liaison between Hezbollah and Iranian intelligence. Mughniyah also reportedly controlled Hezbollah's security apparatus, the Special Operations Command, which handles intelligence and conducts overseas terrorist acts. Allegedly, although he used Hezbollah as a cover, he reported to the Iranians.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> According to Jeffery Goldberg, writing in the <em>New Yorker</em>, &quot;It is believed that Mugniyah takes orders from the office of Iran&lt;U+2019&gt;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, but that he reports to a man named Ghassem Soleimani, the chief of a branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps called Al Quds, or the Jerusalem Force&lt;U+2014&gt;the arm of the Iranian government responsible for sponsoring terror attacks on Israeli targets.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>The European Union lists him as &quot;Senior Intelligence Officer of Hezbollah&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="arrest-warrants-and-attempted-assassination">Arrest warrants and attempted assassination</h2>
<p>Various law enforcement agencies attempted to capture Mughniyah. The United States tried to secure his capture in <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a> in 1986, but were thwarted by French refusal to detain him.</p>
<p>The United States tried to capture him several times afterward, beginning with a 1995 operation that was put in place after it was realized Mughniyah was flying a <a href="Middle_East_Airlines" title="wikilink">Middle East Airlines</a> <a href="charter_flight" title="wikilink">charter flight</a> <a href="A-310_Airbus" title="wikilink">A-310 Airbus</a> from <a href="Khartoum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khartoum</a> to <a href="Beirut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beirut</a> after a meeting with several militant leaders, and was scheduled to make a stop-over in Saudi Arabia. But Saudi airport officials refused to allow the plane to make its stop-over, thwarting American bids to arrest Mughniyah.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>The next year, U.S. military personnel planned to seize him off a ship in <a href="Doha,_Qatar" title="wikilink">Doha, Qatar</a>, but the operation was called off. This plan, dubbed Operation RETURN OX, was carried out by ships and sailors of Amphibious Squadron Three (<a href="USS_&#39;&#39;Tarawa&#39;&#39;" title="wikilink">USS ''Tarawa''</a>, <a href="USS_&#39;&#39;Duluth&#39;&#39;" title="wikilink">USS ''Duluth''</a>, <a href="USS_&#39;&#39;Rushmore&#39;&#39;" title="wikilink">USS ''Rushmore''</a>), Marines of the <a href="13th_Marine_Expeditionary_Unit" title="wikilink">13th Marine Expeditionary Unit</a>, and Navy SEALs assigned to the <a href="U.S._Fifth_Fleet" title="wikilink">U.S. Fifth Fleet</a>. The operation was underway, but was canceled at the last minute when it could not be verified that Mughniyah was actually on board the Pakistani ship.</p>
<p>On 10 October 2001, Mughniyah appeared on the initial list of the FBI's top 22 <a href="FBI_Most_Wanted_Terrorists" title="wikilink">Most Wanted Terrorists</a>, which was released to the public by President Bush, with a reward of up to $5 million offered for information leading to his arrest.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> This reward remained outstanding as of 2006.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>The Israeli government made several alleged attempts to assassinate Mughniyah. His brother Fuad Mugniyah was killed in a <a href="1994_Beirut_car_bombing" title="wikilink">1994 Beirut car bombing</a> and another brother, Jihad, was killed in a car-bombing assassination attempt on the life of Hezbollah founder <a href="Sheikh_Fadlallah" title="wikilink">Sheikh Fadlallah</a> in 1985, this one rumored to be the work of the CIA via the South Lebanese Army. Jeffrey Goldberg in <em>The New Yorker</em> magazine<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> suggested that Mugniyah attended a meeting between Iranian President <a href="Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad" title="wikilink">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> and Syrian President <a href="Bashar_al-Assad" title="wikilink">Bashar al-Assad</a>. He was there representing Hezbollah in Lebanon. Mugniyah had been informed that he was at the top of a US military and CIA assassination list. For this reason, he was said to avoid certain areas of Beirut for fear of being killed by CIA operators.</p>

His assassination took Hezbollah completely by surprise, particularly Sheikh <a href="Hassan_Nasrallah" title="wikilink">Hassan Nasrallah</a>, the organization&lt;U+2019&gt;s leader.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Israel officially denied being behind the killing.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The U.S. Director of National Intelligence <a href="John_Michael_McConnell" title="wikilink">Mike McConnell</a> suggested that was also possible that internal Hezbollah factions or Syria may be to blame for the killing.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>Without naming a source, the German newspaper <em><a href="Die_Welt" title="wikilink">Die Welt</a></em> said<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> a story had been circulated amongst German diplomatic staff that it was possible that associates of late <a href="Assef_Shawkat" title="wikilink">Assef Shawkat</a> had assassinated Mughniyah<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> in revenge for having tipped the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, about coup plot against him, which the Syrian government had foiled a couple of days before Mugniyah's assassination. Releasing the story in advance of going to print, <em>Die Welt</em> said the Syrian embassy in Berlin had rejected the coup story as utterly untrue.</p>
<p>The Kuwaiti newspaper <em>Al-Rai</em> reported that Hezbollah sources said they would retaliate for Mughniyah's death by assassinating Israeli leaders.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reaction">Reaction</h2>
<p>At Mugniyah's funeral, Hassan Nasrallah appeared via video link and in the lengthy eulogy he delivered for his fallen comrade, he declared: &quot;You crossed the borders. Zionists, if you want an open war, let it be an open war anywhere.&quot;<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Lebanese senior cleric <a href="Mohammad_Hussein_Fadlallah" title="wikilink">Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah</a> said that &quot;the resistance has lost one of its pillars.&quot;<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Iran condemned the killing as: &quot;yet another brazen example of organised state terrorism by the Zionist regime&quot;.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>The assassination of Mughniyah was condemned in some parts of the world. Then Italian Foreign Minister <a href="Massimo_D&#39;Alema" title="wikilink">Massimo D'Alema</a> termed the assassination &quot;terror&quot; in an interview,<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> while Gideon Levy of the Israeli newspaper <em>Ha'aretz</em> claimed the assassination actually undermined Israel's security.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> In Kuwait, there was a rally mourning his death. A member of Kuwait's parliament asserted &quot;Mugniyah is a martyr hero who shook the grounds beneath the Zionist enemy (Israel) and America,&quot;<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Jordan's largest political party condemned the assassination as a cowardly crime.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Iran's Supreme Leader <a href="Ali_Khamanei" title="wikilink">Ali Khamanei</a> said &quot;The bloodthirsty Zionists must know that the pure blood of martyrs like Imad Mugniyah will grow hundreds like him and will increase resistance against corruption and atrocities twofold.&quot; When polled shortly afterwards, over 61 percent of Lebanese believed Hezbollah's retaliation for Imad Mugniyah's killing by Israel would be justified.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>The Bush administration welcomed news of his death. A spokesman of the U.S. State Department said: &quot;The world is a better place without this man in it. He was a coldblooded killer, a mass murderer and a terrorist responsible for countless innocent lives lost. One way or another he was brought to justice.&quot;<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Danny Yatom, former head of the Israeli Mossad said: &quot;He was one of the most dangerous terrorists ever on Earth.&quot; <a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
