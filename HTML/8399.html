<p>In October 1914, Mackay suffered a riding accident and was taken to <a href="Royal_Prince_Alfred_Hospital" title="wikilink">Royal Prince Alfred Hospital</a> with a punctured lung and a number of broken ribs.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The injury forced him to miss the scheduled embarkation of his battalion.

<h3 id="gallipoli">Gallipoli</h3>
<p>On 6 August 1915, Mackay was involved in the <a href="Battle_of_Lone_Pine" title="wikilink">Battle of Lone Pine</a>. When the attack began, Mackay went over the top at the head of a number of men. He ignored the first Turkish trench, taking a direct line to his objective. Firing from the hip, he shot and killed a number of Turks in the trenches below. Mackay positioned himself at the junction of two trenches, shooting down more enemy troops. When no others appeared, he came to the belief that the trenches were in Australian hands and ran across the junction into a wide bay. The first man who attempted to follow was shot dead, as were the next two after him. The rest decided not to follow. Mackay took up a position on a fire step, a raised part of the trench floor which allows men to fire over the top. Three Turkish soldiers appeared in the trench. Mackay attempted to fire but his magazine was empty. He lunged at the Turks, grazing one and making all three run. Mackay then instructed his party to fortify the position with sandbags. As the barricade was built up, it became possible for the rest of the party to join Mackay.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The post became the north eastern corner of the new Australian position at Lone Pine. It was in an exposed position and came under hand grenade attack from Turkish troops. Mackay was slightly injured in one such attack. When Lieutenant <a href="Jack_Massie" title="wikilink">Jack Massie</a> was sent to relieve Mackay during the night, Mackay refused to leave the post.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> By the next day Mackay realised that the position could not be held. He personally kept the enemy at bay with his rifle while new barricades were constructed. When he was satisfied with the security of the new position he reported to the battalion commander, who sent him to have his wounds dressed.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Mackay's injuries were severe enough for him to be evacuated to <a href="Malta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malta</a> and then <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, and he did not rejoin his battalion until February 1916, in <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> For his actions at Gallipoli, Mackay was <a href="Mentioned_in_Despatches" title="wikilink">Mentioned in Despatches</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>The troops nicknamed him &quot;Mr Chips&quot;, after the title character of the best selling 1934 novel <em><a href="Goodbye,_Mr._Chips" title="wikilink">Goodbye, Mr. Chips</a></em> and the subsequent <a href="Goodbye,_Mr._Chips_(1939_film)" title="wikilink">1939 film</a>, a reference to his peacetime profession, but also to the impression he gave of being cool, reserved and strict. Some of his staff had reservations about him. <a href="Colonel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colonel</a> <a href="George_Alan_Vasey" title="wikilink">George Alan Vasey</a>, his Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General, asserted that Mackay lacked the ruthlessness to remove Militia officers who were not performing well.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Vasey fumed about &quot;that bloody schoolteacher who wants to dot every 'i' and cross every 't'.&quot;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> His Commander, Royal Australian Artillery, <a href="Brigadier" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brigadier</a> <a href="Edmund_Herring" title="wikilink">Edmund Herring</a> considered Mackay &quot;a most competent and able commander in North Africa and Greece, but a bit old ...

<h3 id="libya">Libya</h3>
<p>His appointment to command the 6th Division meant that Mackay led its—and the Australian Army's—first battles of the war. Doubts about Mackay's ability soon disappeared with the commitment of the division to <a href="Operation_Compass" title="wikilink">Operation Compass</a>. During the <a href="Battle_of_Bardia" title="wikilink">Battle of Bardia</a>, in <a href="Libya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Libya</a> in January 1941, the 6th Division captured the fortified town along with 36,000 Italian prisoners.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> For this success, Mackay was made a <a href="Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> In a war of rapid movement over long distances, Mackay demonstrated careful planning and recognised the need to reinforce success.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> He also impressed others with the way he cared for soldiers' lives. &quot;Not only do I want Tobruk quickly&quot;, he told his brigadiers before the battle, &quot;but I also want it cheaply.&quot;<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The victory at Bardia was followed by successes at <a href="Tobruk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tobruk</a>, <a href="Derna,_Libya" title="wikilink">Derna</a> and <a href="Benghazi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Benghazi</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

While in Greece, Mackay led a hastily-assembled Australian-British-New Zealand-Greek formation known as Mackay Force, defending the <a href="Klidi_Pass" title="wikilink">Klidi Pass</a> at the <a href="Battle_of_Vevi_(World_War_II)" title="wikilink">Battle of Vevi</a>. The Allies were eventually forced to retreat in a fierce assault by the <em><a href="1st_SS_Division_Leibstandarte_SS_Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler</a></em> brigade. Mackay was therefore the only Australian general to face the <em><a href="Waffen_SS" title="wikilink">Waffen SS</a></em> in battle.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>As in Libya, Mackay shared the hardships of living in the field with his men, and impressed them by his coolness during air raids. They watched him sit in the open during attacks; on one such occasion on 19 April 1941, Mackay waited out a two-and-a-half-hour raid when his car was hit and his driver wounded.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> One staff officer &quot;noticed Mackay moving in front of his tent quite unconcerned about the movement of enemy planes. He neither looked at the planes nor at the men dashing about, but they saw him, and those moving towards shelter stopped, and many of those who had gained shelter returned to their duties. Personal example is the only paying proposition in such circumstances.&quot;<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> For his actions in Greece, he was Mentioned in Despatches a sixth time,<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> and awarded the <a href="Greek_War_Cross" title="wikilink">Greek War Cross</a> (First Class).<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>Casualties in Greece included Mackay's son-in-law, Captain W. H. Travers, who was captured in the <a href="Battle_of_Crete" title="wikilink">Battle of Crete</a>.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Mackay resolved to reform the battalions that had been destroyed in Greece, and to rebuild his shattered division.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> He developed a training program in which he attempted to apply the lessons of the campaign in Greece.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>

Brigadier <a href="Sydney_Rowell" title="wikilink">Sydney Rowell</a> recommended to Blamey that all generals over the age of 50 be retired. In July 1941, Ernest Turnbull, representing the motion picture industry, approached <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Robert_Menzies" title="wikilink">Robert Menzies</a> and several members of his Cabinet about the possibility of Mackay becoming Chief Commonwealth Film Censor. However, Menzies had a different post in mind. On 24 July 1941 the <a href="War_Cabinet" title="wikilink">War Cabinet</a> decided to appoint a <a href="General_Officer_Commanding" title="wikilink">GOC</a> Home Forces. In a cable to Blamey, Menzies stipulated that the War Cabinet wanted a high-ranking officer like Mackay with active service in the current war. Blamey replied that he considered &quot;Mackay most suitable for the appointment.&quot;<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>On 14 August 1941, Mackay handed over command of the 6th Division to Major General <a href="Edmund_Herring" title="wikilink">Edmund Herring</a>. Mackay departed <a href="Cairo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cairo</a> for Australia by <a href="flying_boat" title="wikilink">flying boat</a> on 22 August. En route, he stopped in <a href="Singapore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Singapore</a> to confer with Major General Bennett, and had dinner at the <a href="Raffles_Hotel" title="wikilink">Raffles Hotel</a> with his son, Lieutenant Iven Mackay, an officer with the <a href="2/18th_Battalion_(Australia)" title="wikilink">2/18th Infantry Battalion</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>Mackay assumed command of Home Forces on 1 September 1941, with the rank of lieutenant general. His task was to prepare the militia to repel a <a href="Planned_invasion_of_Australia_during_World_War_II" title="wikilink">Japanese invasion</a>.</p>

<p>With the <a href="Fall_of_Singapore" title="wikilink">Fall of Singapore</a> in February 1942, Mackay's son Iven became a <a href="prisoner_of_war" title="wikilink">prisoner of war</a> of the <a href="Empire_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese</a>.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Mackay submitted a plan in which he outlined a strategy whereby the army would concentrate on the defence of the most vital areas of eastern and southern Australia.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> This proposal later gave rise to the controversial but mythical &quot;<a href="Brisbane_Line" title="wikilink">Brisbane Line</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>Regular officers took the opportunity to give Mackay a number of petty snubs. Army Headquarters continually addressed him as &quot;major general&quot;, although his promotion to lieutenant general had been gazetted, and his pay was only &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,564 compared with Sturdee's &lt;U+00A3&gt;2,269.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> His AIF serial number was taken away from him and he was sent a new recruit's papers to fill in. The Military Board even attempted to bring him before a medical board to decide his fitness for further service. Only the intervention of the <a href="Minister_for_Defence_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Minister for the Army</a>, <a href="Frank_Forde" title="wikilink">Frank Forde</a>, averted this.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> During a sweeping reorganisation of the army by Blamey, Mackay became commander of the <a href="Second_Army_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Second Army</a> on 6 April 1942.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

Blamey proposed Mackay as a second choice but preferred Herring as he was much younger, and this was important in the taxing New Guinea climate.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> However, when Blamey relinquished command of <a href="New_Guinea_Force" title="wikilink">New Guinea Force</a> on 30 January 1943, he handed over temporary command to Mackay to enable Herring to go on leave. The period was a quiet one, with no major operations being carried out, and Mackay handed back to Herring and returned to command of the Second Army at <a href="Parramatta,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Parramatta, New South Wales</a> in May 1943.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>On 28 August 1944, Mackay once again assumed command of New Guinea Force.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> This time, important operations were being undertaken in the <a href="Battle_of_Finschhafen" title="wikilink">Battle of Finschhafen</a> and Mackay's period of command was marred by disagreements with <a href="General_(United_States)" title="wikilink">General</a> <a href="Douglas_MacArthur" title="wikilink">Douglas MacArthur</a>'s staff over the reinforcement of Finschhafen.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Junior commanders felt that Mackay should have been more forceful, and should have enlisted the help of his superior, Blamey, at an earlier stage.

<p>In November 1943, it was announced that <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a> <a href="John_Curtin" title="wikilink">John Curtin</a>, with Blamey's approval, had appointed Mackay as <a href="High_Commissioner" title="wikilink">High Commissioner</a> to <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a>.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Sir Iven and Lady Mackay sailed from <a href="Perth,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Perth, Western Australia</a> on SS <em>Tanda</em> on 14 February 1944.

<p>Mackay was approached to consider nomination as a <a href="Liberal_Party_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Liberal Party of Australia</a> candidate for the <a href="Australian_Senate" title="wikilink">Australian Senate</a>, but declined.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Instead, he accepted a directorship of Australian Cotton Textile Industries. From 1950 to 1952, he chaired the New South Wales recruiting committee which was set up by the Federal government to increase enlistment in the armed forces. The University of Sydney appointed Mackay an honorary <a href="Esquire_Bedell" title="wikilink">Esquire Bedell</a> in 1950 and awarded him an <a href="honorary_degree" title="wikilink">honorary degree</a> of <a href="Doctor_of_Laws" title="wikilink">Doctor of Laws</a> in 1952. When Blamey died in 1951, Mackay rushed to Melbourne to be one of his <a href="pallbearer" title="wikilink">pallbearers</a>. Mackay visited Greece in 1952 for the unveiling of a memorial to <a href="Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="wikilink">British Commonwealth</a> servicemen who died in the 1941 campaign. In 1961, he returned for the dedication of the Commonwealth War Cemetery at <a href="Faliro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Faliro</a>.
