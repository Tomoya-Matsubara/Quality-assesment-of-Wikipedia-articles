<h3 id="college-athletic-career">College athletic career</h3>
<p>Nutt was the last player recruited by legendary Arkansas head coach <a href="Frank_Broyles" title="wikilink">Frank Broyles</a> before his retirement in <a href="1976" class="uri" title="wikilink">1976</a>. Nutt was recruited as a drop-back style <a href="quarterback" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarterback</a> and started four games as a true freshman after starting quarterback <a href="Ron_Calcagni" title="wikilink">Ron Calcagni</a> was sidelined with an injury. Nutt also played that year for the <a href="Southwest_Conference" title="wikilink">Southwest Conference</a> champion Arkansas <a href="basketball" class="uri" title="wikilink">basketball</a> team under coach <a href="Eddie_Sutton" title="wikilink">Eddie Sutton</a> which went 26-2 and bulled its way to a 16-0 conference mark.</p>
<p>With the retirement of Frank Broyles, Arkansas hired <a href="Lou_Holtz" title="wikilink">Lou Holtz</a> as the head football coach. Holtz established an <a href="option_offense" title="wikilink">option offense</a> which did not make use of Nutt's passing style and relegated him to the bench as a backup.</p>
<p>Disappointed by his lack of playing time, Nutt transferred to <a href="Oklahoma_State_University_-_Stillwater" title="wikilink">Oklahoma State University</a> and played two years as the starting quarterback. During his time at Oklahoma State he also played for the basketball team. Nutt graduated from Oklahoma State in <a href="1981" class="uri" title="wikilink">1981</a> with a degree in <a href="physical_education" title="wikilink">physical education</a>.</p>
<h3 id="assistant-coaching-career">Assistant coaching career</h3>
<p>After graduation Nutt became a graduate assistant for Oklahoma State under head coach <a href="Jimmy_Johnson_(football_coach)" title="wikilink">Jimmy Johnson</a>. In <a href="1983" class="uri" title="wikilink">1983</a> Nutt returned to Arkansas and became an assistant coach under his former coach Lou Holtz. In the spring of <a href="1984" class="uri" title="wikilink">1984</a> Nutt was hired by <a href="Arkansas_State_University" title="wikilink">Arkansas State University</a> as a full-time assistant coach but chose to return to Oklahoma State that summer as a receiver's coach before ever reporting for the Arkansas State job.</p>
<p>Nutt spent six seasons as an assistant coach for receivers and quarterbacks at Oklahoma State and was promoted to <a href="offensive_coordinator" title="wikilink">offensive coordinator</a> in <a href="1989" class="uri" title="wikilink">1989</a>. During his years at Oklahoma State he coached legendary running backs <a href="Barry_Sanders" title="wikilink">Barry Sanders</a> and <a href="Thurman_Thomas" title="wikilink">Thurman Thomas</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="1990" class="uri" title="wikilink">1990</a> Nutt returned to the University of Arkansas as an assistant under head coach <a href="Jack_Crowe" title="wikilink">Jack Crowe</a> and established a reputation as an excellent recruiter. Nutt remained with the Razorbacks for three seasons and established relationships with Arkansas high school football coaches that would serve him in good stead in later years.</p>
<h3 id="career-at-murray-state">Career at Murray State</h3>
<p>In <a href="1993" class="uri" title="wikilink">1993</a> Nutt received his first head coaching position at <a href="NCAA_Division_I-AA" title="wikilink">NCAA Division I-AA</a> <a href="Murray_State_University" title="wikilink">Murray State University</a>. He struggled during his first two seasons on the field with 4-7 and 5-6 records respectively but had success rebuilding the team personnel.</p>
<p>In <a href="1995" class="uri" title="wikilink">1995</a> his efforts paid off with an 11-1 record and an <a href="Ohio_Valley_Conference" title="wikilink">Ohio Valley Conference</a> championship after reeling off an 8-0 conference mark. Nutt received Ohio Valley Conference Coach of the Year honors and was recognized with the <a href="Eddie_Robinson_National_Division_I-AA_Coach_of_the_Year_Award" title="wikilink">Eddie Robinson National Division I-AA Coach of the Year Award</a>.</p>
<p>Nutt repeated his success for the <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a> season by establishing an 11-2 record and completing another undefeated run through his Ohio Valley Conference schedule. Murray State won its first round Division I-AA playoff appearance, earning Nutt the OVC Coach of the Year honors and regional Coach of the Year honors.</p>
<h3 id="career-at-boise-state">Career at Boise State</h3>
<p>Nutt made the step up to <a href="NCAA_Division_I-A" title="wikilink">NCAA Division I-A</a> the next year when <a href="Boise_State_University" title="wikilink">Boise State</a> hired him to take over their program, which was the lowest ranked of 112 Division-IA schools and had posted a poor 2-10 record the year before. Boise State had just made the jump to Division I-A football and was looking for a recruiter and motivator to jump start their program.</p>
<p>Nutt's team earned a respectable 5-6 record in <a href="1997" class="uri" title="wikilink">1997</a> playing at the Division I-A level with its Division I-AA players. Nutt's team beat rival <a href="University_of_Idaho" title="wikilink">Idaho</a> and almost pulled off an upset against <a href="Big_Ten_Conference" title="wikilink">Big Ten Conference</a> program <a href="University_of_Wisconsin-Madison" title="wikilink">Wisconsin</a>.</p>
<h3 id="career-as-arkansas-head-coach">Career as Arkansas head coach</h3>
<p>Nutt became the head coach of the Razorbacks on <a href="10_December" title="wikilink">10 December</a> <a href="1997" class="uri" title="wikilink">1997</a>, succeeding head coach <a href="Danny_Ford" title="wikilink">Danny Ford</a>. The Razorback team had suffered through a long low period under a succession for head coaches in the previous years, having only received two bowl bids in the eight seasons prior to Nutt's arrival.</p>
<p>Nutt's predecessor, Danny Ford, had limited success on the field during his tenure, struggling through back-to-back 4-7 seasons in his last two years, however Ford did succeed in recruiting a solid squad which Nutt inherited for his first season.</p>
<p>Nutt's Razorbacks were picked to finish last in the <a href="Southeastern_Conference" title="wikilink">Southeastern Conference</a> Western Division in <a href="1998" class="uri" title="wikilink">1998</a> but ended up with a 9-3 record and a share of the division title. The Razorbacks almost defeated the soon-to-be National Champion <a href="University_of_Tennessee" title="wikilink">University of Tennessee</a> on its home field during the season. For their efforts the Razorbacks received their first-ever invitation to the <a href="Capital_One_Bowl" title="wikilink">Citrus Bowl</a> and ended the season ranked 16th after losing to the <a href="University_of_Michigan" title="wikilink">University of Michigan</a>. Nutt was selected as the Football News' National Coach of the Year.</p>
<p>In <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a> Nutt's Razorbacks were picked to win the SEC Western Division but suffered a series of setbacks during the season but recovered to defeat nationally ranked Tennessee and <a href="Mississippi_State_University" title="wikilink">Mississippi State University</a> to earn a <a href="Cotton_Bowl_(game)" title="wikilink">Cotton Bowl</a> bid versus arch-rival <a href="University_of_Texas_at_Austin" title="wikilink">Texas</a>. The Razorbacks defeated Texas 27-6, becoming the first team to ever hold Texas to negative rushing yards in a game. The Cotton Bowl victory propelled them into the Top 20 rankings to end the season.</p>
<p>For the <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a> season the Razorbacks lost the core of his team and suffered a string of injuries to his remaining starters including season-ending injuries to all of the starting running backs. The Razorbacks struggled through the season as a question mark until the final two games when he defeated ranked Mississippi State and <a href="Louisiana_State_University" title="wikilink">LSU</a> teams to pull out another winning record and another bowl appearance.</p>
<p>In the <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a> season the Razorbacks started off poorly with three straight losses in SEC play. They then came back to win six of the last seven including highly ranked <a href="University_of_South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a> and <a href="Auburn_University" title="wikilink">Auburn</a> teams. Based on this performance the Razorbacks were selected to return to the Cotton Bowl to face the defending National Champion <a href="University_of_Oklahoma" title="wikilink">Oklahoma Sooners</a>. The Razorbacks lost to Oklahoma in a low-scoring affair.</p>
<p>In <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a> Nutt's Razorbacks stumbled midway through the season but pulled together five straight wins, including a last second miracle play against LSU, to pull out a share of a Western Division Title that was up for grabs due to the ineligibility of division-leading <a href="University_of_Alabama" title="wikilink">Alabama</a>. Arkansas made a poor showing against <a href="University_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">Georgia</a> in the <a href="SEC_Championship_Game" title="wikilink">SEC Championship Game</a> and ended the season with a disappointing loss to <a href="Minnesota_Golden_Gophers" title="wikilink">Minnesota</a> in the <a href="Music_City_Bowl" title="wikilink">Music City Bowl</a>.</p>
<p><img src="HoustonNuttTV.jpg" title="fig:Coach Nutt during a September 13, 2003 upset of then No. 6 University of Texas at Austin Longhorns at Texas Memorial Stadium in Austin. Final score was 38-28." alt="Coach Nutt during a September 13, 2003 upset of then No. 6 University of Texas at Austin Longhorns at Texas Memorial Stadium in Austin. Final score was 38-28." /> In <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a> Nutt's team stampeded to a 4-0 record including an overpowering performance against #5 Texas on their home field. The early season success raised fans expectations sky-high and put Nutt under intense pressure when the Razorbacks lost their next three games putting them out of contention for the National Championship or even the SEC Western Division crown. The Razorbacks won 4 of their last 5 games and defeated <a href="University_of_Missouri_-_Columbia" title="wikilink">Missouri</a> in the <a href="Independence_Bowl" title="wikilink">Independence Bowl</a>. After the 2003 season, <a href="University_of_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Nebraska</a> was widely seen as courting coach Nutt to be their head coach, after the firing of <a href="Frank_Solich" title="wikilink">Frank Solich</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a> and <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a> campaigns were widely expected to be rebuilding years, due to very young teams (a &quot;young team&quot; is one that relies heavily on <a href="underclassman" class="uri" title="wikilink">underclassman</a>, such as <a href="freshman" class="uri" title="wikilink">freshman</a> and <a href="sophomore" title="wikilink">sophomores</a>). The 2004 season ended with a 5 win - 6 loss record, and the team ended the year without a bowl invitation for the first time under Coach Nutt (since 1998, 6 straight bowls). After the 2004 season, it was highly rumored (LSU denies any flirtation) that <a href="Louisiana_State_University" title="wikilink">LSU</a> offered coach Nutt a head coaching job after <a href="Nick_Saban" title="wikilink">Nick Saban</a> left the Tigers for the <a href="NFL" class="uri" title="wikilink">NFL</a> team the <a href="Miami_Dolphins" title="wikilink">Miami Dolphins</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a> season was also a rebuilding year as expected. Tough losses to the <a href="University_of_Southern_California" title="wikilink">USC</a> Trojans (score: 70-17) as well as to <a href="Vanderbilt_University" title="wikilink">Vanderbilt</a> and <a href="University_of_South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a> showed that the season had been predicted accurately. The team was ineligible for a bowl for the second season in a row (and the second season overall under coach Nutt). This led to <a href="University_of_Arkansas" title="wikilink">Arkansas</a> <a href="Arkansas_Razorbacks" title="wikilink">Razorback</a> fans calling for coaching changes. After meeting with <a href="Frank_Broyles" title="wikilink">Frank Broyles</a> (athletic director) after the conclusion of the season, coaching changes were made by Nutt in the offseason, the most notable of which was the addition of <a href="Gus_Malzahn" title="wikilink">Gus Malzahn</a> (previously head coach at Springdale High School in <a href="Springdale,_Arkansas" title="wikilink">Springdale, Arkansas</a>) as <a href="offensive_coordinator" title="wikilink">offensive coordinator</a>. Also notable in the offseason were the signing of several highly recruited in-state players, including Springdale High School <a href="quarterback" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarterback</a> <a href="Mitch_Mustain" title="wikilink">Mitch Mustain</a> and <a href="wide_receiver" title="wikilink">wide receiver</a> Damian Williams.</p>
<p>The <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> season began with the Razorbacks being humbled 50-14 at a home game in Fayetteville by <a href="University_of_Southern_California" title="wikilink">USC</a>. Following the loss to the Trojans, Nutt announced that Mustain would replace Robert Johnson as the Hogs' starting quarterback. Mustain led Arkansas to 8 straight wins before losing the starting job to Casey Dick, who had been slotted to start at the beginning of the season but could not due to a back injury. Dick led the Razorbacks to two more victories for a total of 10 straight wins, including wins over 2nd ranked Auburn and 13th ranked Tennessee. The Razorbacks moved to No. 7 in the BCS poll. However, the Hogs lost their last regular season game to the 8th ranked LSU Tigers 31-26. Despite the loss, the Hogs were still Western Division Champions of the SEC, and played the 11-1, 4th ranked Florida Gators for the SEC Championship. Florida won that one as well, 38-28. The Razorbacks lost to the 5th ranked Wisconsin Badgers on New Years' Day, 2007 in Orlando in the Capital One Bowl. A highlight of the season so far was the second place finish of do-everything tailback Darren McFadden in the Heisman Trophy voting. McFadden set a school season record for rushing, and also had receiving, return and passing touchdowns to his credit during the season. At the conclusion of his sophomore season, he had amassed more rushing yards in two seasons than any SEC back in history excluding Georgia's Herschel Walker.</p>
<h2 id="overall-coaching-positives-and-negatives">Overall coaching positives and negatives</h2>
<p><a href="As_of_2005" title="wikilink">As of 2005</a> the Razorbacks had the best home record in the SEC during Nutt's tenure. They were only one of three SEC schools to play in three New Year's Day bowls in the last five years.</p>
<p>Nutt's teams have been noted for a series of overtime games including the two longest overtime games in NCAA history. His teams have also made several record-setting comebacks which are unusual for teams that rely primarily on the running game.</p>
<p>Off the field, Nutt's players have been named to the <a href="SEC_Academic_Honor_Roll" title="wikilink">SEC Academic Honor Roll</a> 83 times and he has established a reputation as a responsible coach academically.</p>
<p>Some criticism has come for an <a href="Southeastern_Conference" title="wikilink">SEC</a> win record of below 50% and because he calls his own offensive plays during a game instead of relying on an <a href="offensive_coordinator" title="wikilink">offensive coordinator</a> (this changed during the 2005 post season when he hired Gus Malzahn as offensive coordinator).</p>
