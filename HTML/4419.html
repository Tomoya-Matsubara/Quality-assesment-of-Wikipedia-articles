<p>The <strong>River Dart</strong> is a <a href="river" class="uri" title="wikilink">river</a> in <a href="Devon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Devon</a>, <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a> which <a href="source_(river)" title="wikilink">rises</a> high on <a href="Dartmoor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dartmoor</a>, and releases to the sea at <a href="Dartmouth,_Devon" title="wikilink">Dartmouth</a>. Its valley and surrounding area is a place of great natural beauty.</p>
<h2 id="watercourse">Watercourse</h2>
<p>The river's name is presumed to be <a href="Brythonic_languages" title="wikilink">Brythonic</a> <a href="Celtic_languages" title="wikilink">Celtic</a> meaning 'river where oak trees grow'<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> due to the banks of the lower Dart being covered in ancient woods of native <a href="oak" class="uri" title="wikilink">oak</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Bray notes in 1832 that the name was occasionally spelled 'Darant'.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The river begins as two separate branches (the <a href="East_Dart" title="wikilink">East Dart</a> and <a href="West_Dart" title="wikilink">West Dart</a>), which join at <a href="Dartmeet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dartmeet</a>. The paths along these rivers offer very attractive walking, and there are several small <a href="waterfall" title="wikilink">waterfalls</a>. The rivers are crossed by a number of <a href="clapper_bridge" title="wikilink">clapper bridges</a>, notably at the <a href="hamlet_(place)" title="wikilink">hamlet</a> of <a href="Postbridge,_Devon" title="wikilink">Postbridge</a>.</p>
<p>After leaving the moor, the Dart flows southwards past <a href="Buckfast_Abbey" title="wikilink">Buckfast Abbey</a> and through the towns of <a href="Buckfastleigh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buckfastleigh</a>, <a href="Dartington" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dartington</a> and <a href="Totnes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Totnes</a>. At Totnes, where there is a seventeenth century <a href="weir" class="uri" title="wikilink">weir</a> (rebuilt in the 1960s), it becomes <a href="tide" title="wikilink">tidal</a>, and there are no bridges below the town.</p>

<p>A passenger ferry operates across the river from the village of <a href="Dittisham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dittisham</a> to a point adjacent to the <a href="Greenway_Estate" title="wikilink">Greenway Estate</a>. Formerly the home of the late crime writer <a href="Agatha_Christie" title="wikilink">Agatha Christie</a>, this has stunning views across the river, and the house and gardens are now owned by the <a href="National_Trust_for_Places_of_Historic_Interest_or_Natural_Beauty" title="wikilink">National Trust</a> and are open to the public.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The Dart <a href="estuary" class="uri" title="wikilink">estuary</a> is a large <a href="ria" class="uri" title="wikilink">ria</a> and is popular for <a href="sailing" class="uri" title="wikilink">sailing</a>. The village of <a href="Kingswear" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kingswear</a> and town of <a href="Dartmouth,_England" title="wikilink">Dartmouth</a> are on the east and west sides of the estuary, and are linked by two vehicle <a href="ferries" class="uri" title="wikilink">ferries</a> and a passenger ferry. The deep water port of Dartmouth is a sheltered haven.</p>
<p>The entrance to the river from the sea is a rocky entrance with cliffs either side. On the East side <a href="Kingswear_Castle" title="wikilink">Kingswear Castle</a> sits very close to the water's edge, and on the west side <a href="Dartmouth_Castle" title="wikilink">Dartmouth Castle</a> is built on a rocky <a href="promontory" class="uri" title="wikilink">promontory</a> at sea level. The castles once operated a <a href="boom_(navigational_barrier)" title="wikilink">defensive chain</a> across the estuary, which was raised at dusk to destroy enemy ships attempting to attack the harbour. The remains of the operating mechanisms for the chain are still visible in Dartmouth castle.</p>
<h2 id="crossings">Crossings</h2>
<p><img src="The_River_Dart_at_Totnes.jpg" title="fig:The River Dart facing upstream at Totnes, with Totnes Bridge in the background." alt="The River Dart facing upstream at Totnes, with Totnes Bridge in the background." /> The flooded ria that forms the lower reaches of the Dart, with its deep water and steeply sloping valley sides, is a considerable barrier to crossing traffic. There are no bridges below <a href="Totnes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Totnes</a>.</p>
<p>At the mouth of the river, it separates the communities of <a href="Dartmouth,_Devon" title="wikilink">Dartmouth</a> and <a href="Kingswear" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kingswear</a>. There have been proposals to bridge the river here, but these have come to nothing. Instead the two places are linked by, in order going upstream, the <a href="Dartmouth_Lower_Ferry" title="wikilink">Lower Ferry</a>, <a href="Dartmouth_Passenger_Ferry" title="wikilink">Passenger Ferry</a> and <a href="Dartmouth_Higher_Ferry" title="wikilink">Higher Ferry</a>. The Lower and Higher ferries both carry vehicles, the Higher one linking the <a href="A379_road" title="wikilink">A379 road</a>.</p>
<p>Some  upstream of Dartmouth, the <a href="Greenway_Ferry" title="wikilink">Greenway Ferry</a> carries pedestrians across the river from the village of <a href="Dittisham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dittisham</a> to Greenway Quay.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>A further  upstream is Totnes, where the river is spanned by two road bridges, a railway bridge and a footbridge over. Totnes Bridge is the nearest bridge to the sea and is a road bridge built in 1826-28 by Charles Fowler. Some  upstream is Brutus Bridge, constructed in 1982 as part of a road traffic-relief scheme and carrying the concurrent <a href="A385_road" title="wikilink">A385</a> and <a href="A381_road" title="wikilink">A381 roads</a>. A further  upstream, the railway bridge carries the <a href="National_Rail" title="wikilink">National Rail</a> <a href="Exeter_to_Plymouth_line" title="wikilink">Exeter to Plymouth line</a> over the river. Immediately upstream of the railway bridge is a footbridge, built in 1993 to provide access to the <a href="Totnes_(Littlehempston)_railway_station" title="wikilink">Totnes (Littlehempston)</a> terminus of the <a href="South_Devon_Railway_Trust" title="wikilink">South Devon Railway</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>The lower section of the River Dart forms Dartmouth Harbour, a deep water natural harbour with a long history of maritime usage. In modern times, the port's commercial activity has declined, but it is still a busy port for local <a href="fishing_vessel" title="wikilink">fishing vessels</a> and a wide variety of <a href="yacht" title="wikilink">yachts</a> and other private boats. Several local companies specialise in shipbuilding and repairs to small tonnage craft.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Dartmouth,_Devon" title="wikilink">Dartmouth</a> is also the home of the <a href="Britannia_Royal_Naval_College" title="wikilink">Britannia Royal Naval College</a> and as a result is routinely visited by sizeable <a href="naval_ship" title="wikilink">naval ships</a>. Smaller naval tenders are often seen carrying out training exercises in the harbour and river. Large <a href="cruise_ship" title="wikilink">cruise ships</a> are occasional visitors, with the largest visitor to date being the <a href="Royal_Princess" title="wikilink">MV <em>Royal Princess</em></a> (30,277 <a href="Gross_Register_Tonnage" title="wikilink">GRT</a>).<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Upstream, the Dart is navigable to seagoing vessels as far as the weir in <a href="Totnes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Totnes</a>. The river almost dries out for  below Totnes at <a href="spring_tide" title="wikilink">spring tide</a> low water, but vessels drawing up to  can proceed to Totnes from one and a half hours after low water. Above the weir, the river is navigable only to small craft such as <a href="kayak" title="wikilink">kayaks</a> and <a href="canoe" title="wikilink">canoes</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Several companies operate trips on the river, including <a href="Dart_Pleasure_Craft_Limited" title="wikilink">Dart Pleasure Craft Limited</a>, who also trade as <em>River Link</em> and operate the <a href="Dartmouth_Passenger_Ferry" title="wikilink">Passenger Ferry</a> between Dartmouth and <a href="Kingswear" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kingswear</a>. These include cruises from Dartmouth to Totnes, which can be combined with journeys on the <a href="Paignton_and_Dartmouth_Steam_Railway" title="wikilink">Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway</a> and an <a href="open_top_bus" title="wikilink">open top bus</a> between Totnes and <a href="Paignton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paignton</a> to create a circular trip.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The harbour and port are popular leisure boating locations, and several <a href="marina" title="wikilink">marinas</a> and <a href="boat_yard" title="wikilink">boat yards</a> are located on the river. The <a href="Port_of_Dartmouth_Royal_Regatta" title="wikilink">Port of Dartmouth Royal Regatta</a> takes place annually over three days at the end of August.</p>
<h2 id="canoeing-and-kayaking">Canoeing and kayaking</h2>
<p><img src="NewbridgeRiverDart.jpg" title="fig:Kayakers playing on a wave under Newbridge" alt="Kayakers playing on a wave under Newbridge" /> The upper reaches of <a href="Dartmoor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dartmoor</a>, especially those on the Dart, are a focal point for <a href="whitewater_kayaking" title="wikilink">whitewater kayakers</a> and <a href="canoeists" class="uri" title="wikilink">canoeists</a>. The best known sections of the river are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="Upper_Dart" title="wikilink">Upper Dart</a></em> from <a href="Dartmeet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dartmeet</a> to <a href="Newbridge,_River_Dart" title="wikilink">Newbridge</a> (<a href="International_Scale_of_River_Difficulty" title="wikilink">Grade</a> 3/4 (higher in high water), advanced run).<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></li>
<li><em><a href="The_Loop,_River_Dart" title="wikilink">The Loop</a></em> from Newbridge to <a href="Holne_Bridge" title="wikilink">Holne Bridge</a> (Grade 2/3, beginner/intermediate run).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></li>
<li><em><a href="The_Lower,_River_Dart" title="wikilink">The Lower</a></em> from Holne Bridge to <a href="Buckfastleigh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buckfastleigh</a> (Grade 2, beginner section).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sections of the East and West Dart above Dartmeet, as well as the <a href="River_Webburn" title="wikilink">Webburn</a> are also paddled when conditions permit. This is somewhat controversial, as riparian landowners and those responsible for local fisheries maintain that the East and West Dart should not be paddled.</p>
<p>The lower reaches of the Dart, including the estuary are suitable for flat water touring.</p>
<h2 id="angling">Angling</h2>
<p>Angling is very popular in the Dart Valley. The <a href="West_Dart" title="wikilink">West Dart</a> is notable ground for <a href="salmon" class="uri" title="wikilink">salmon</a> spawning <a href="redds" class="uri" title="wikilink">redds</a>.</p>
<h2 id="literature-and-folklore">Literature and folklore</h2>
<p><img src="River_Dart_Weir_at_Totnes.jpg" title="fig:The weir at Totnes" alt="The weir at Totnes" width="220" /> The River Dart is the source of much <a href="folklore" class="uri" title="wikilink">folklore</a> on Dartmoor, where it is traditionally respected and feared - the waters have a tendency to rise without notice following heavy rainfall on the moors above, adding to the dangers of its rapids and powerful currents. This gave rise to the couplet:</p>
<dl>

<dd>&quot;River of Dart, Oh River of Dart!
</dd>
<dd>Every year thou claimest a heart.&quot;
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The 1951 non-fiction book <em>The River Dart</em> by <a href="Ruth_Manning-Sanders" title="wikilink">Ruth Manning-Sanders</a> centres on the river and its history.</p>
<p>The English poet <a href="Alice_Oswald" title="wikilink">Alice Oswald</a> wrote the 48-page poem <em>Dart</em> (2002), which was awarded the <a href="T._S._Eliot_Prize" title="wikilink">T. S. Eliot Prize</a> for 2002. The poem's voice is that of the River Dart, which Oswald adapted from three years of recorded conversations and research with people who inhabit the communities along the river.</p>
<p>The Weaver Twins from <a href="Stoke_Gabriel" title="wikilink">Stoke Gabriel</a> wrote a song entitled, &quot;<a href="http://www.radiocarolinetv.co.uk/#/weaver-twins/4533492985">Dart</a>&quot;. The music video was filmed along the river and has been featured on <a href="Radio_Caroline" title="wikilink">Radio Caroline</a> television.</p>
