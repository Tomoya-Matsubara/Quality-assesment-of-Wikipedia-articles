<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Leach is a 1983 graduate of <a href="Brigham_Young_University" title="wikilink">Brigham Young University</a>, with a B.S. in American Studies. He is atypical among <a href="NCAA" class="uri" title="wikilink">NCAA</a> <a href="Division_I" title="wikilink">Division I</a> head football coaches, as he did not play football at the college level. Leach is one of only five such coaches, with <a href="Mark_Mangino" title="wikilink">Mark Mangino</a> of the <a href="University_of_Kansas" title="wikilink">University of Kansas</a>, <a href="Paul_Johnson_(American_football_coach)" title="wikilink">Paul Johnson</a> of the <a href="United_States_Naval_Academy" title="wikilink">United States Naval Academy</a>, <a href="Dennis_Franchione" title="wikilink">Dennis Franchione</a> of <a href="Texas_A&amp;M_University" title="wikilink">Texas A&amp;M University</a>, and <a href="Charlie_Weis" title="wikilink">Charlie Weis</a> of the <a href="University_of_Notre_Dame" title="wikilink">University of Notre Dame</a>.

<h2 id="coaching-career">Coaching career</h2>
<p>Leach is known for building some very potent offenses, directing very prolific passing-oriented teams that have broken school and NCAA records at <a href="Valdosta_State_University" title="wikilink">Valdosta State University</a>, <a href="University_of_Kentucky" title="wikilink">University of Kentucky</a>, and <a href="University_of_Oklahoma" title="wikilink">University of Oklahoma</a>, where he was offensive coordinator, and <a href="Texas_Tech" title="wikilink">Texas Tech</a>, where he became head coach in 2000. The Leach-coached Red Raiders' best finish came in 2002 and 2005, having 9-win seasons. In 2002, Tech swept its in-state conference rivals <a href="Baylor_University" title="wikilink">Baylor</a>, <a href="University_of_Texas" title="wikilink">Texas</a>, and <a href="Texas_A&amp;M_University" title="wikilink">Texas A&amp;M</a> first time since 1997 and defeated <a href="Clemson_University" title="wikilink">Clemson</a> by 55-15 in the Tangerine Bowl. It was the Red Raiders' first postseason win since 1995 when they beated the <a href="United_States_Air_Force_Academy" title="wikilink">Air Force</a> Falcons in the Copper Bowl. In 2005, the Raiders opened their season 6-0, the best start since 1998, and defeated <a href="University_of_Oklahoma" title="wikilink">Oklahoma</a> first time under Leach's tenure.</p>
<p>Under Leach, the <a href="Texas_Tech_Red_Raiders" title="wikilink">Red Raiders</a> have built a strong passing offense. It has led the NCAA in passing yardage for four years in a row. Leach might be more known for plugging new <a href="quarterback" title="wikilink">quarterbacks</a> into his spread/pass-oriented offense and having them reel off NCAA records. At Kentucky he tutored prospect <a href="Tim_Couch" title="wikilink">Tim Couch</a> into a No.1 <a href="NFL_Draft" title="wikilink">NFL Draft</a> Pick. At Oklahoma, <a href="Josh_Heupel" title="wikilink">Josh Heupel</a> became an NFL draft pick following a year under Leach's tutelege. At Tech, he inserted <a href="Kliff_Kingsburry" title="wikilink">Kliff Kingsburry</a> for three years, who broke the NCAA records for completions in a career. Following Kingsburry, <a href="BJ_Symons" title="wikilink">BJ Symons</a> stepped in producing the most passing yards in a season in NCAA history. <a href="Sonny_Cumbie" title="wikilink">Sonny Cumbie</a> jumped up leading the Red Raiders to an upset of nationally ranked California in the <a href="Holiday_Bowl" title="wikilink">Holiday Bowl</a>. <a href="Cody_Hodges" title="wikilink">Cody Hodges</a> got called to duty, leading the NCAA in passing. Sophomore quarterback <a href="Graham_Harrell" title="wikilink">Graham Harrell</a>, the first non-senior starting QB since <a href="Kliff_Kingsburry" title="wikilink">Kliff Kingsburry</a>, struggled early in the 2006 season. However, he showed steady improvement beginning with the game against <a href="Iowa_State_University" title="wikilink">Iowa State</a> and ended the season with a record-setting victory over the <a href="Minnesota_Golden_Gophers" title="wikilink">Minnesota Golden Gophers</a>.</p>
<p>Under Mike Leach, Texas Tech has been known for its high-scoring offense and come-from-behind victories. A 70-35 win over heavily favored <a href="Texas_Christian_University" title="wikilink">Texas Christian University</a> in 2004 began with TCU leading 21-0 with 8 minutes remaining in the second quarter. Before Tech's scoring drives started, a TCU defensive back was caught mouthing into a TV camera, &quot;They aren't going to score.&quot; Later in the season, Texas Tech beat <a href="University_of_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Nebraska</a>, 70-10, forcing the Cornhuskers to give up more points in a single game than they had before in their 114-year history. In 2005, the Red Raiders were losing to <a href="Kansas_State_University" title="wikilink">Kansas State</a>, 13-10, late in the second quarter but won the game 59-20. Also in 2005, Tech had a halftime lead of 14-10 over <a href="Texas_A&amp;M_University" title="wikilink">Texas A&amp;M</a>. By the end of the game, they increased the margin to 56-17. It was the Aggies' worst loss to the Red Raiders in the 64-year-old series.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/magazine/04coach.html?ei=5090&amp;en=c9f46201dc95f91d&amp;ex=1291352400&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all" class="uri" title="wikilink">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/magazine/04coach.html?ei=5090&amp;en=c9f46201dc95f91d&amp;ex=1291352400&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all</a> The 2006 season ended with the Insight Bowl where Tech overcame a 31-point deficit in the third quarter to defeat the <a href="Minnesota_Golden_Gophers" title="wikilink">Minnesota Golden Gophers</a> 44-41 in overtime. The victory made history as the largest comeback in Division I-A bowl history.</p>
<p>During the 2005 game against Texas A&amp;M, <a href="Fox_Sports_Net" title="wikilink">Fox Sports Net</a> featured a segment that focused on Leach's odd affinity for <a href="pirate" title="wikilink">pirates</a>.</p>
<p>Mike Leach was chosen to coach the South team during the 2007 inaugural <a href="North-South_All-Star_Classic" title="wikilink">Inta Juice North-South All-Star Classic</a> game.</p>
<p>Leach is 56-34 with the Red Raiders including 6-8 against the <a href="Texas_Longhorns" title="wikilink">Texas Longhorns</a> and the <a href="Texas_A&amp;M_Aggies" title="wikilink">Texas A&amp;M Aggies</a>, Tech's arch-rivals. He is the all-time winningest coach in postseason play in the Tech football history with 4-3 record.</p>
