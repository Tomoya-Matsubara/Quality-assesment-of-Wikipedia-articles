<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>The plot of the book is that you, your parents and your annoying older brother, Pete, go to Lonestar National Park (Snakebite Canyon). While camping in the desert you find a shop and can buy one of two valuable items: a pair of magic snake eyes that will allow you to transform into different animals or a map to an old (and deadly) gold mine. The Visitors Center shop at Snakebite Canyon looks <em>sooo</em> boring, and the shopkeeper has to be crazy. That's just what YOU think.</p>
<p>If you buy the eyes, the animal transformation part of the novel offers a lot of entertaining possibilities, like a bear, a fish or a falcon. But the original owner wants them back. And he's one angry old <a href="Crotalus_scutulatus" title="wikilink">rattlesnake</a>! There is also a way that the reader can leave this storyline and try the other one: become a bat and then take a ride on an old dusty ore car. Endings in this storyline vary from being in a zoo, death, scaring some tourists, returning to normal (but with fangs), being bagged as a rattlesnake into a sack, becoming a bear and sent to be watched by scientists or being sent to Alaska, where you remain a bear forever. But you will need to be careful because in one of the branches, you might swallow a snake eye and in that one's ending, you would need to over-eat! Strangely, it is only in this ending that this effect is a problem.</p>
<p>If you buy the map, the Lost Gold Mine features a fun little riddle that actually requires a few moments of thought to solve. &quot;Beware the panther though!&quot; the Watchers of the Mine (who are made of eyeballs) would say, if you came across them and they gave you a key. The alternative way in is up a windy path. Choose the panels wisely when you get there. A key is in one of them. You could strike it rich. Or you could get attacked by a giant kid-eating spider! Endings in this storyline vary from guarding the Lost Mine, striking it rich, being caught by the Watchers, a trap eating you, death, to being stuck in the rocks all day. Now, don't start getting difficult. We <em>know</em> the Mine can't be lost if it's on a map. It's not the Mine that's lost, just all the people who've ever entered it...</p>
