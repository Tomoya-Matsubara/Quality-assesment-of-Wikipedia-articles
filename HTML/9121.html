<p>The <strong>Ulster Defence Union</strong> was a <a href="Irish_Unionism" title="wikilink">Unionist</a> organization formed in 1893 to oppose the <a href="Irish_Home_Rule_Movement" title="wikilink">Irish Home Rule movement</a>, following a rally at the <a href="Ulster_Hall" title="wikilink">Ulster Hall</a>, <a href="Belfast" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belfast</a>. Its principal aim was to resist the <a href="Irish_Government_Bill_1893" title="wikilink">Second Home Rule Bill</a> of 1893.</p>
<p>The UDU was launched by the publication of a manifesto on 17 March 1893, the signatories of which included <a href="Edward_James_Saunderson" title="wikilink">Colonel Edward Saunderson, MP</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Shortly after its creation, it adopted the motto <em>Quis Separabit?</em> (Who shall Separate?)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The structure of the new Union was set out in a &quot;Plan of Organisation&quot; which was signed by <a href="Sir_Daniel_Dixon,_1st_Baronet" title="wikilink">Daniel Dixon</a>, <a href="Lord_Mayor_of_Belfast" title="wikilink">Lord Mayor of Belfast</a> and President of the Provisional Committee.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>On 1 September 1893, the Second Home Rule Bill was passed by the House of Commons by 347 votes to 304, but when it came to the <a href="House_of_Lords" title="wikilink">House of Lords</a> it was heavily defeated, by 419 votes to only 41. By October 1893, the UDU had a Central Assembly described as comprising six hundred gentlemen, which first met on 24 October 1893, from among whom an executive committee of forty was elected.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> This committee also included, <em><a href="ex_officio" title="wikilink">ex officio</a></em>, the Ulster Unionist members of both <a href="Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">houses of parliament</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In October, 1893, at an Ulster Defence Union meeting in Belfast, Saunderson said, celebrating the scale of opposition in the Lords </p>
<p>Eventually, in 1905, the organization took part in the formation of the <a href="Ulster_Unionist_Council" title="wikilink">Ulster Unionist Council</a>, which was a precursor of the <a href="Ulster_Unionist_Party" title="wikilink">Ulster Unionist Party</a>.</p>
