He also won the <a href="Maxwell_Award" title="wikilink">Maxwell Award</a> and was the first ever football player to win the <a href="James_E._Sullivan_Award" title="wikilink">James E.

He played football for the <a href="United_States_Military_Academy" title="wikilink">United States Military Academy at West Point</a> <a href="Army_Black_Knights_football" title="wikilink">Army Black Knights football</a> team. Because his father was a doctor, Felix Blanchard was nicknamed &quot;Little Doc&quot; as a boy.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> After football, he served in the <a href="United_States_Air_Force" title="wikilink">United States Air Force</a> from 1947 until 1971 when he retired with the rank of <a href="Colonel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colonel</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-years">Early years</h2>
<p>Blanchard was born on December 11, 1924 in <a href="Bishopville,_South_Carolina" title="wikilink">Bishopville, South Carolina</a>. His father was a doctor and had played college football at <a href="Tulane_University" title="wikilink">Tulane University</a> and <a href="Wake_Forest_University" title="wikilink">Wake Forest University</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Blanchard, nicknamed &quot;Little Doc&quot; due to his father's occupation, attended high school at <a href="Saint_Stanislaus_College" title="wikilink">Saint Stanislaus College</a> in <a href="Bay_St._Louis,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Bay St. Louis, Mississippi</a>. He led the school's football team, the Rockachaws, to an undefeated season during his senior year in 1941. Blanchard was recruited to play college football by Army, <a href="Fordham_University" title="wikilink">Fordham University</a> and the <a href="University_of_Notre_Dame" title="wikilink">University of Notre Dame</a>, among others.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Blanchard said in 1985 that he had been contacted about going to West Point when he was in high school.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He said, &quot;At that point in time, I really wasn&lt;U+2019&gt;t interested. Academically, I never was too hot, so I never had any idea I would pass the entrance examination and go to West Point.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Instead, Blanchard chose to play for the <a href="University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill" title="wikilink">University of North Carolina</a> <a href="North_Carolina_Tar_Heels_football" title="wikilink">Tar Heels</a>, partly because the team was coached by his mother's cousin, <a href="Jim_Tatum" title="wikilink">Jim Tatum</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> While at North Carolina, he played on the freshman team because in 1942, NCAA rules still prevented freshmen from playing for the varsity.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>After completing his <a href="freshman" class="uri" title="wikilink">freshman</a> season at North Carolina in 1942<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>, he tried to enlist in the <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">United States Navy</a>'s <a href="V-12_Navy_College_Training_Program" title="wikilink">V-12 program</a>, which allowed students to complete their education in return for a service commitment.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> He was rejected because he was considered overweight and had poor vision.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> He then enlisted in the <a href="United_States_Army" title="wikilink">United States Army</a> until securing an appointment to West Point.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He was stationed in New Mexico with a chemical-warfare unit until his father secured him an appointment to West Point, and he enrolled in July 1944.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="west-point-years">West Point years</h2>
<p>During his three years of playing football at West Point (he sat out the 1943 season<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>), his team under coach <a href="Earl_Blaik" title="wikilink">Earl &quot;Red&quot; Blaik</a> compiled an undefeated 27&lt;U+2013&gt;0&lt;U+2013&gt;1 record - the tie being <a href="1946_Army_vs._Notre_Dame_football_game" title="wikilink">a famous 0&lt;U+2013&gt;0 game</a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> against <a href="Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football" title="wikilink">Notre Dame</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In 1944, after a famous season-ending win over <a href="Navy_Midshipmen_football" title="wikilink">Navy</a>, General <a href="Douglas_MacArthur" title="wikilink">Douglas MacArthur</a> even took time out from his war duties to send this <a href="Telegraphy" title="wikilink">telegram</a>:<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>Notre Dame coach <a href="Ed_McKeever" title="wikilink">Ed McKeever</a> was amazed by Blanchard. After his 1944 team lost to Army by a score of 59&lt;U+2013&gt;0, McKeever said, &quot;I've just seen <a href="Superman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Superman</a> in the flesh. He wears number 35 and goes by the name of Blanchard.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>An all-around athlete, Blanchard served as the <a href="placekicker" class="uri" title="wikilink">placekicker</a> and <a href="punter_(football_position)" title="wikilink">punter</a> in addition to his primary roles as an <a href="fullback_(American_football)" title="wikilink">offensive fullback</a> and a <a href="linebacker" class="uri" title="wikilink">linebacker</a> on defense. In the first capacity, he teamed with soon to be fellow Heisman winner <a href="Glenn_Davis_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Glenn Davis</a> (Davis won the Heisman the following year, 1946) to form one of the most lethal <a href="rush_(American_football)" title="wikilink">rushing</a> combinations in <a href="History_of_American_football" title="wikilink">football history</a>. Blanchard, in his three seasons at West Point, scored 38 <a href="touchdown" title="wikilink">touchdowns</a>, gained 1,908 yards and earned the nickname &quot;Mr. Inside.&quot; Teammate Davis earned the nickname &quot;Mr. Outside&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and in November 1945, they both shared the cover of <a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Time</a> magazine.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1945, he became the first college junior to ever win the Heisman Trophy and the first ever football player to win the James E. Sullivan Award.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In 1984 at the awards ceremony marking the 50th Heisman Trophy presentation, Blanchard took the occasion to recall, in comparison to the big glitzy shows for the ceremony today, how he learned of his Heisman selection in 1945. He said, &quot;I got a telegram. It said, 'You&lt;U+2019&gt;ve been selected to win the Heisman Trophy. Please wire collect.'&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1946, Blanchard missed the first two games of the season due to an injury to his knee.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1947, Blanchard played himself in the movie <em><a href="The_Spirit_of_West_Point" title="wikilink">The Spirit of West Point</a></em>. His West Point team-mate Glenn Davis also played himself in the film. Other cast members include <a href="Robert_Shayne" title="wikilink">Robert Shayne</a> as Coach Colonel Earl &quot;Red&quot; Blaik, <a href="Anne_Nagel" title="wikilink">Anne Nagel</a> as Mrs. Blaik, <a href="George_O&#39;Hanlon" title="wikilink">George O'Hanlon</a> as Joe Wilson, Michael Browne as Roger &quot;Mileaway&quot; McCarty, Tanis Chandler as Mildred, Mary Newton as Mrs. Mary Blanchard and William Forrest as Doc Blanchard's father, Dr. Felix Blanchard. Also appearing as themselves are 1940 Heisman Trophy winner <a href="Tom_Harmon" title="wikilink">Tom Harmon</a> and sportscasters <a href="Bill_Stern" title="wikilink">Bill Stern</a> and <a href="Harry_Wismer" title="wikilink">Harry Wismer</a>. The screenplay was written by Tom Reed based on a story by Mary Howard.

<p>In addition to football, Blanchard was also a member of the Army <a href="track_and_field" title="wikilink">track and field</a> team. In a track meet in 1945, weighing in at 210 pounds and standing 6 feet 2 inches tall, he ran the <a href="100_yard_dash" title="wikilink">100 yard dash</a> in 10 seconds. He also won championships in the <a href="shot_put" title="wikilink">shot put</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

Some Congressmen said the players were seeking special privileges, and the War Department turned down the request.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Blanchard then chose to embark upon a career in the <a href="United_States_Air_Force" title="wikilink">United States Air Force</a> and became a <a href="Fighter_aircraft" title="wikilink">fighter</a> pilot. In 1959, while flying back to his base near London, an oil line in his plane broke and a fire broke out. He could have parachuted to safety, but the plane might have crashed into a village. He instead stayed with the plane and made a perfect landing. The event garnered him an Air Force commendation for bravery.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
