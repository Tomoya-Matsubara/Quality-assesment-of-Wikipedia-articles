<p><strong>John MacBride</strong> (c. 1735 – 17 February 1800) was an officer of the <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a> and a politician who saw service during the <a href="Seven_Years&#39;_War" title="wikilink">Seven Years' War</a>, the <a href="American_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">American War of Independence</a> and the <a href="French_Revolutionary_Wars" title="wikilink">French Revolutionary Wars</a>, eventually rising to the rank of <a href="Admiral_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Admiral of the Blue</a>.</p>
<p>MacBride entered the navy after serving on merchant vessels and distinguished himself in a number of actions during the Seven Years' War, including cutting out a <a href="privateer" class="uri" title="wikilink">privateer</a>, which secured him the rank of <a href="post-captain" class="uri" title="wikilink">post-captain</a> by the end of the conflict. He was instrumental in establishing and securing a British settlement on the <a href="Falkland_Islands" title="wikilink">Falkland Islands</a> in the years of peace which followed, and also performed service to the <a href="British_Royal_Family" title="wikilink">Royal Family</a> by transporting the <a href="George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">King's</a> sister, <a href="Caroline_Matilda_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Caroline Matilda</a>. Still in active service by the outbreak of war with the American colonies, MacBride took command of a <a href="ship_of_the_line" title="wikilink">ship of the line</a> and saw action in engagements under <a href="Augustus_Keppel,_1st_Viscount_Keppel" title="wikilink">Keppel</a> and <a href="George_Brydges_Rodney,_1st_Baron_Rodney" title="wikilink">Rodney</a>. He was also active against privateers, capturing the <em>Comte d'Artois</em> in a heated battle off the Irish coast. Further service followed with <a href="Sir_Hyde_Parker,_5th_Baronet" title="wikilink">Parker's</a> fleet against the Dutch and with <a href="Samuel_Barrington" title="wikilink">Barrington</a> in the <a href="English_Channel" title="wikilink">Channel</a>.</p>
<p>MacBride ended the war serving ashore in Ireland, and in 1784 embarked on a political career, becoming <a href="Member_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">MP</a> for <a href="Plymouth_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Plymouth</a>. Promoted to flag rank with the outbreak of war with <a href="Revolutionary_France" title="wikilink">Revolutionary France</a>, he commanded squadrons off the enemy coasts, and transported troops to support land operations on the continent. His last active service was in 1795, though he was promoted to Admiral of the Blue shortly before his death in 1800.</p>

<p>MacBride arrived with <em>Jason</em>,  and the storeship , in January 1766, with orders to secure a settlement and to inform any existing inhabitants that the islands were a British possession.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The British consolidated <a href="Port_Egmont" title="wikilink">Port Egmont</a>, made several cruises in the surrounding waters, and in December came across the French settlement.
