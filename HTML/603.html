It was divided into the periods of Western Han (202 BCE – 9 CE) and Eastern Han (25–220 CE), and briefly interrupted by the <a href="Xin_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Xin Dynasty</a> (9–23 CE) of <a href="Wang_Mang" title="wikilink">Wang Mang</a>. The capital of Western Han was <a href="Chang&#39;an" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chang'an</a>, and the capital of Eastern Han was <a href="Luoyang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luoyang</a>. The <a href="Emperor_of_China" title="wikilink">emperor</a> headed the government, <a href="Promulgation" title="wikilink">promulgating</a> all written laws, serving as <a href="commander-in-chief" class="uri" title="wikilink">commander-in-chief</a> of the armed forces, and presiding as the chief executive official. He appointed all government officials who earned a salary of 600 <a href="bushel" title="wikilink">bushels</a> of grain or more (though these salaries were largely paid in <a href="Ancient_Chinese_coinage" title="wikilink">coin cash</a>) with the help of advisors who reviewed each nominee. Near the beginning of the dynasty, <a href="Kings_of_the_Han_Dynasty" title="wikilink">semi-autonomous regional kings</a> rivaled the emperor's authority. This autonomy was greatly diminished when the imperial court enacted reforms following the threats to central control like the <a href="Rebellion_of_the_Seven_States" title="wikilink">Rebellion of the Seven States</a>. The <a href="empress_dowager" title="wikilink">empress dowager</a> could either be the emperor's actual or symbolic mother, and was in practice more powerful than the emperor, as she could override his decisions. The emperor's executive powers could also be practiced by any official upon whom he bestowed the Staff of Authority. These powers included the right to execute criminals without the imperial court's permission.</p>
<p>The highest officials in the central bureaucracy, who provided advisory, censorial, executive, and judicial roles in governing the empire, consisted of <a href="Cabinet_(government)" title="wikilink">cabinet</a> members known as <a href="Three_Excellencies" title="wikilink">the Excellencies</a>, heads of large specialized ministries known as the <a href="Nine_Ministers" title="wikilink">Nine Ministers</a>, and various metropolitan officials of the capital region.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Distinguished salary-ranks were granted to officials in the bureaucracy, nobles of the imperial family, concubines of the harem, and military officers of the armed forces.</p>
<p>Local government divisions, in descending order by size, were the <a href="Zhou_(country_subdivision)" title="wikilink">province</a>, <a href="commandery" class="uri" title="wikilink">commandery</a>, <a href="County_(China)" title="wikilink">county</a>, and <a href="District_(China)" title="wikilink">district</a>. Local <a href="fief" title="wikilink">fiefs</a> of <a href="Chinese_nobility" title="wikilink">the nobility</a> included the kingdom, which was modeled largely upon the regular commandery, as well as the <a href="marquess" title="wikilink">marquessate</a>, modelled largely upon the regular county. Although the central government's monopolies on salt, iron, and liquor eventually failed and were relinquished back to private production, the government successfully nationalized the issuing of coin currency through its imperial <a href="Mint_(coin)" title="wikilink">mint</a>, which lasted from 113 BCE until the <a href="End_of_the_Han_Dynasty" title="wikilink">end of the dynasty</a>. The <a href="conscription" class="uri" title="wikilink">conscription</a> system for commoners as non-professional soldiers was reduced in size in favor of a <a href="volunteer_army" title="wikilink">volunteer army</a> and a substitution tax by Eastern Han. A small professional <a href="standing_army" title="wikilink">standing army</a> existed throughout Western and Eastern Han. During times of crisis, large <a href="militia" title="wikilink">militias</a> were raised and certain officer titles were revived for temporary use.</p>

For a time, the rulers of the Warring States claimed nominal allegiance to an overlord king of the <a href="Zhou_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Zhou Dynasty</a> (c. 1050 – 256 BCE), yet the Zhou kings' political power and prestige was less than that of later Chinese emperors.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The imperial system fell apart after the fall of Qin in 206 BCE. However, following <a href="Chu-Han_contention" title="wikilink">Han's victory over Chu</a>, the King of Han reestablished the imperial system and is known posthumously as <a href="Emperor_Gaozu_of_Han" title="wikilink">Emperor Gaozu</a> (r. 202–195 BCE).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The Han system of imperial government borrowed many of its core features from the model set forth by the Qin Dynasty. For example, Gaozu's Chancellor <a href="Xiao_He" title="wikilink">Xiao He</a> (d. 193 BCE) integrated much of the statutes of the Qin law code into the newly-compiled Han law code.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Yet Gaozu's establishment of central control over only a third of the empire&lt;U+2014&gt;the other two-thirds of territory ruled by semi-autonomous kingdoms&lt;U+2014&gt;strayed from Qin's imperial model which gave the emperor direct control over all of China.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> However, a series of reforms would eventually strip away any vestiges of the kingdoms' independence. Han emperors would thereafter enjoy full and direct control over China as the first Qin emperor had.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The Han court's gradual move towards reestablishing central control can also be seen in its monetary policy. While the Qin regime installed a nationwide standard <a href="Ancient_Chinese_coinage" title="wikilink">currency</a>,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> the early Western Han regime oscillated between abolishing and legalizing private mints, commandery-level mints, and kingdom-level mints issuing various coins.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In 113 BCE the Han court finally established a central-government monopoly over issuing a standard, nationwide currency.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="roles-rights-and-responsibilities">Roles, rights, and responsibilities</h4>
<p><a href="Emperor_of_China" title="wikilink">The emperor</a>, who enjoyed a paramount social status, was the head of the government administration. His rule was virtually <a href="Absolutism" title="wikilink">absolute</a>, although civil officials, representing the competing interests of different state organs, scrutinized his decisions.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Although the Grand Commandant had a nominal role as commander-in-chief, the emperor served as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The emperor had the sole right to appoint central government officials whose salary-rank was 600-<em>shi</em> or higher.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The emperor also appointed the leading officials at the provincial, commandery, and county levels of government.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Appointees to office were usually recommended men from the commanderies, family relatives of high officials, or student graduates of the <a href="Taixue" title="wikilink">Imperial University</a>. This institution was established in 124 BCE, and provided a <a href="Confucianism" title="wikilink">Confucian</a>-based education for those entering <a href="civil_service" title="wikilink">civil service</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> </p>
<p>The emperor had the exclusive right to modify the <a href="Code_(law)" title="wikilink">law code</a> and issue new laws in the form of imperial edicts (<em>zhao</em> &lt;U+8A54&gt;) and decrees (<em>ling</em> &lt;U+4EE4&gt;).<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> However, he often accepted the decisions and reforms suggested by his chief judicial minister, the Commandant of Justice.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The emperor also acted as the supreme judge. Any lawsuits which a county administration, then commandery administration, and then Minister of Justice could not resolve were deferred to the emperor.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The emperor's role as supreme judge could be temporarily duplicated by any official he designated in times of emergency or in distant borderlands where central government had little influence. This entailed a symbolic conferral of power, which was embodied in the Staff of Authority (<em>Jiezhang</em> &lt;U+7BC0&gt;&lt;U+6756&gt;).<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Roughly 2 m (6 ft) in height and decorated with ribbons, the Staff of Authority was often granted to an official with a specific errand, such as acting on behalf of the emperor as ambassador to a foreign country, appointing civilians to office, or immediately promoting a deserving military officer on the field of battle.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Moreover, it granted its bearer the authority to sentence criminals and political rebels with execution without notifying the court first.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>During the Qin Dynasty, the first Qin emperor's legitimacy to rule was ultimately decided by his ability to conquer others. However, by the time of <a href="Wang_Mang" title="wikilink">Wang Mang</a>'s (r. 9–23 CE) reign, the <a href="Mandate_of_Heaven" title="wikilink">Mandate of Heaven</a> was considered the only legitimate source of imperial authority.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> This concept was given greater prominence after the state officially sponsored the worship of <a href="Tian" title="wikilink">Heaven</a> over that of the <a href="Three_Sovereigns_and_Five_Emperors" title="wikilink">Five Powers</a> in 31 BCE.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Moreover, the philosophy of the scholar <a href="Dong_Zhongshu" title="wikilink">Dong Zhongshu</a> (179–104 BCE), which held that a dynasty's rule on earth was bound to greater <a href="Cosmology" title="wikilink">cosmological</a> cycles in the universe, was officially sponsored by the Han court from <a href="Emperor_Wu_of_Han" title="wikilink">Emperor Wu's</a> (r. 141–87 BCE) reign onward. The emperor was expected to behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, lest he incur the wrath of Heaven and bring an end to his reign.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He became the highest priest in the land. By performing certain religious rites and rituals, the emperor acted as a sacred link between Heaven and Earth.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="court-conferences">Court conferences</h4>
<p>Although the emperor held supreme power, he more often sought the advice of his cabinet and other ministers before making decisions and when revoking them.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> He often assembled leading officials for debates or discussions on policy, known as court conferences (<em>tingyi</em> &lt;U+5EF7&gt;&lt;U+8B70&gt;). Various issues were debated at these gatherings, such as installment of new emperors, enfeoffment of nobles, the establishment of new ancestral temples, reforms to the state religion, the monetary or tax systems, management of government monopolies on salt and iron (when they existed during Western Han), the introduction of new laws or the repeal of old ones, complex lawsuits, or whether or not to declare war on a foreign country or accept peaceful negotiation.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Although the emperor could reject the decisions reached by his court conference, he did so at the risk of alienating his leading ministers. More often than not, he was forced to accept the <a href="Consensus_decision-making" title="wikilink">majority consensus</a> of his ministers, whose individual opinions were equally tallied regardless of their standing or salary-rank.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="empress-dowager">Empress dowager</h3>
<p>When the emperor died without officially appointing a successor, his widow, the <a href="empress_dowager" title="wikilink">empress dowager</a>, had the sole right to appoint one of the late emperor's surviving sons or relatives to the position.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Most often the successor chosen in this fashion was a minor, thus the empress dowager served as regent over the government. A high-status male relative, usually a father or brother, would assume control of the Imperial Secretariat.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Even when an emperor reached his majority and became an active ruler, he often sought the advice and acceptance of the empress dowager on policy decisions; she also had the right to override his decisions.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The empress dowager was protected by the Minister of the Guards, yet if her faction&lt;U+2014&gt;the <a href="consort_clan" title="wikilink">consort clan</a>&lt;U+2014&gt; was removed from power, he was then responsible for keeping her under <a href="house_arrest" title="wikilink">house arrest</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>The post of Grand Tutor (<em>Taifu</em> &lt;U+592A&gt;&lt;U+5085&gt;), although given the highest civil status below the emperor, was not regularly occupied. The role was considered an honorary rather than substantive office.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In Western Han, a Grand Tutor was supposedly appointed at the beginning of each emperor's reign, and was not replaced until that emperor's death.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> However, only four Grand Tutors were appointed between 202 BCE – 6 CE.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> In contrast, during Eastern Han, a new Grand Tutor was appointed when every emperor except <a href="Emperor_Huan_of_Han" title="wikilink">Emperor Huan of Han</a> (r. 146–168 CE) had a Grand Tutor installed at the beginning of their reigns.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The Grand Tutor's salary-rank was unspecified in literary sources, although it was likely higher than the 10,000-<em>shi</em> rank.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The Grand Tutor was nominally in charge of providing a young emperor with moral guidance, but it is doubtful that this role was ever taken seriously or formally conducted.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The post often served to deliberately block someone from obtaining a more important post, such as one of the Excellencies, while Grand Tutors were usually elder statesmen chosen for their age rather than merits (so they would die off quickly after being appointed).<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="title-variations">Title variations</h4>
<p>The Excellencies (<em>gong</em>, literally translated as &quot;<a href="Chinese_nobility" title="wikilink">dukes</a>&quot;) were the foremost officials in central government who formed <a href="Cabinet_(government)" title="wikilink">the cabinet</a> during both Western and Eastern Han.

The Great Commandant's post was irregularly filled, and it was retitled to Grand Marshal (<em>Da sima</em> &lt;U+5927&gt;&lt;U+53F8&gt;&lt;U+99AC&gt;) in 119 BCE.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> In 8 BCE, the post of Imperial Counselor was abolished in favor of a Grand Excellency of Works (<em>da sikong</em> &lt;U+5927&gt;&lt;U+53F8&gt;&lt;U+7A7A&gt;), and by 1 BCE the Chancellor's post was abolished and replaced by the Grand Excellency Over the Masses (<em>da situ</em> &lt;U+5927&gt;&lt;U+53F8&gt;&lt;U+5F92&gt;).<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> On June 8, 51 CE the prefix &quot;Grand&quot; (&lt;U+5927&gt;) was removed from the titles of the Excellency over the Masses and Excellency of Works, while the Grand Marshal was reinstated with the original title of Grand Commandant, and would remain so for the rest of Eastern Han.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The exact salary figures for the Excellencies before 8 BCE are unknown, although from that year forward they were given a 10,000-<em>shi</em> salary-rank, in addition to periodic gifts which further boosted their incomes.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p>Whenever the emperor was absent from a court conference but sought its advice, he relied on the chancellor to direct it and inform him of the resulting majority opinion.

<p>The Grand Commandant (also known as the Commander-in-Chief) was the head commander of the military in Western Han, yet his office was irregularly filled (from 205–202 BCE, from 196–195 BCE, from 189–177 BCE, from 154–150 BCE, and in 140 BCE).<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> After 119 BCE, the generals <a href="Huo_Qubing" title="wikilink">Huo Qubing</a> (d. 117 BCE) and <a href="Wei_Qing" title="wikilink">Wei Qing</a> (d. 106 BCE) simultaneously held the title until their deaths, but when the post was revived in 87 BCE it became politicized when conferred as a <a href="regent" class="uri" title="wikilink">regent</a>'s title for <a href="Huo_Guang" title="wikilink">Huo Guang</a> (d. 68 BCE).<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The regent was thus considered one of the Three Excellencies, although he was not technically part of the cabinet.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> <img src="Nswag,_dinastia_han,_cavallo_e_cavaliere.JPG" title="fig:A Han painted pottery mounted cavalryman in armor and uniform" alt="A Han painted pottery mounted cavalryman in armor and uniform" /></p>
<p>The Grand Commandant's office witnessed significant changes during the Eastern Han.
