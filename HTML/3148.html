<p><strong>Comet Hyakutake</strong> (<a href="Japanese_language" title="wikilink">Japanese</a>: &lt;U+767E&gt;&lt;U+6B66&gt;&lt;U+5F57&gt;&lt;U+661F&gt; <em>Hyakutake suisei</em>, <a href="International_Phonetic_Alphabet" title="wikilink">IPA</a> ; <a href="Astronomical_naming_conventions#Comets" title="wikilink">formally designated</a> <strong>C/1996 B2</strong>) is a <a href="comet" class="uri" title="wikilink">comet</a> that was discovered in January 1996, which passed very close to <a href="Earth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Earth</a> in March of that year. It was dubbed <strong>The <a href="Great_Comet" title="wikilink">Great Comet</a> of 1996</strong>; its passage near the Earth was one of the closest cometary approaches of the previous 200 years. Hyakutake appeared very bright in the night sky and was widely seen around the world. The comet temporarily upstaged the much anticipated <a href="Comet_Hale-Bopp" title="wikilink">Comet Hale-Bopp</a>, which was approaching the inner <a href="solar_system" title="wikilink">solar system</a> at the time.</p>
<p>Scientific observations of the comet led to several discoveries. Most surprising to cometary scientists was the first discovery of <a href="X-ray" class="uri" title="wikilink">X-ray</a> emission from a comet, believed to have been caused by ionised <a href="solar_wind" title="wikilink">solar wind</a> particles interacting with neutral <a href="atom" title="wikilink">atoms</a> in the <a href="coma_(cometary)" title="wikilink">coma</a> of the comet. The <a href="Ulysses_probe" title="wikilink">Ulysses spacecraft</a> unexpectedly crossed the comet's tail at a distance of more than <a href="1_E11_m" title="wikilink">500 million</a> <a href="kilometre" title="wikilink">km</a> from the <a href="comet_nucleus" title="wikilink">nucleus</a>, showing that Hyakutake had the longest tail known for a comet.</p>
<p>Hyakutake is a <a href="Comet#Orbital_characteristics" title="wikilink">long-period comet</a>. Before its most recent passage through the <a href="solar_system" title="wikilink">solar system</a>, its orbital period was about 15,000 <a href="year" title="wikilink">years</a>, but the <a href="gravity" title="wikilink">gravitational</a> influence of the <a href="giant_planet" title="wikilink">giant planets</a> has increased this period to 72,000 years.</p>
<h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2>
<p>The comet was discovered on <a href="January_30" title="wikilink">January 30</a> <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a> by <a href="Yuji_Hyakutake" title="wikilink">Yuji Hyakutake</a>, an <a href="amateur" class="uri" title="wikilink">amateur</a> <a href="astronomer" class="uri" title="wikilink">astronomer</a> from southern <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He had been searching for comets for years and had moved to <a href="Kagoshima" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kagoshima</a> partly for the dark skies in nearby rural areas. He was using a powerful set of <a href="binoculars" class="uri" title="wikilink">binoculars</a> with six-<a href="inch" class="uri" title="wikilink">inch</a> <a href="objective_lens" title="wikilink">objective lenses</a> to scan the skies on the night of the discovery.</p>
<p>This comet was actually the second Comet Hyakutake; Hyakutake had discovered comet C/1995 Y1 several weeks earlier.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> While re-observing his first comet (which never became visible to the <a href="naked_eye" title="wikilink">naked eye</a>) and the surrounding patch of sky, Hyakutake was surprised to find another comet in almost the same position as the first had been. Hardly believing a second discovery so soon after the first, Hyakutake reported his observation to the <a href="National_Astronomical_Observatory_of_Japan" title="wikilink">National Astronomical Observatory of Japan</a> the following morning.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Later that day, the discovery was confirmed by independent observations.</p>
<p>At the time of its discovery, the comet was shining at <a href="apparent_magnitude" title="wikilink">magnitude</a> 11.0 and had a coma approximately 2.5 <a href="arcminute" title="wikilink">arcminutes</a> across. It was approximately 2 <a href="astronomical_unit" title="wikilink">astronomical units</a> (AU) from the <a href="Sun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sun</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Later, a pre-discovery image of the comet was found on a photograph taken on <a href="January_1" title="wikilink">January 1</a>, when the comet was about 2.4 AU from the Sun and had a magnitude of 13.3.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="orbit">Orbit</h2>
<p>When the first calculations of the comet's <a href="orbit" class="uri" title="wikilink">orbit</a> were made, scientists realised that the comet was going to pass just 0.1 AU from the Earth on <a href="25_March" title="wikilink">25 March</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Only three comets in the previous <a href="century" class="uri" title="wikilink">century</a> had passed closer. <a href="Comet_Hale-Bopp" title="wikilink">Comet Hale-Bopp</a> was already being discussed as a possible &quot;<a href="great_comet" title="wikilink">great comet</a>&quot;; the astronomical community eventually realised that Hyakutake might also become spectacular because of its close approach.</p>
<p>Moreover, the comet's orbit showed that it had last returned to the inner <a href="solar_system" title="wikilink">solar system</a> approximately 17,000 years earlier. Because the comet likely had passed close to the Sun several times before,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> the approach in 1996 would not be a maiden arrival from the <a href="Oort_cloud" title="wikilink">Oort cloud</a>, a place where comets with orbital periods of millions of years came from. Comets entering the inner solar system for the first time may brighten rapidly before fading as they near the Sun, as a layer of highly volatile material evaporates. This was the case with <a href="Comet_Kohoutek" title="wikilink">Comet Kohoutek</a> in 1973; it was initially touted as potentially spectacular, but only appeared moderately bright. Older comets show a more consistent brightening pattern. Thus, all indications pointed that Comet Hyakutake would be bright.</p>
<p>Besides approaching close to the Earth, the comet would also be visible throughout the night to <a href="northern_hemisphere" title="wikilink">northern hemisphere</a> observers at its closest approach because of its path, passing very close to the <a href="pole_star" title="wikilink">pole star</a>. This would be an unusual occurence, because most comets are close to the Sun in the sky when the comets are at their brightest, leading to the comets appearing in a sky not completely dark.</p>

<p>Hyakutake became visible to the naked eye in early March. By mid-March, the comet was still fairly unremarkable, shining at 4th <a href="Apparent_magnitude" title="wikilink">magnitude</a> with a tail about 5 <a href="degree_(angle)" title="wikilink">degrees</a> long. As it neared its closest approach to Earth, it rapidly became brighter, and its tail grew in length. By <a href="March_24" title="wikilink">March 24</a>, the comet was one of the brightest objects in the night sky, and its tail stretched 35 degrees. The comet had a notably bluish-green colour.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The closest approach occurred on <a href="25_March" title="wikilink">25 March</a>. Hyakutake was moving so rapidly across the night sky that its movement could be detected against the <a href="star" title="wikilink">stars</a> in just a few <a href="minute" title="wikilink">minutes</a>; it covered the <a href="diameter" class="uri" title="wikilink">diameter</a> of a <a href="full_moon" title="wikilink">full moon</a> (half a degree) every 30 minutes. Observers estimated its magnitude as around 0, and tail lengths of up to 80 degrees were reported.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Its coma, now close to the <a href="zenith" class="uri" title="wikilink">zenith</a> for observers at mid-northern <a href="latitude" title="wikilink">latitudes</a>, appeared approximately 1.5 to 2 degrees across, roughly four times the diameter of the full moon.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Even to the naked eye, the comet's head appeared distinctly green, due to strong emissions from <a href="diatomic_carbon" title="wikilink">diatomic carbon</a> (C<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>Because Hyakutake was at its brightest for only a few days, it did not have time to permeate the public imagination in the way that <a href="Comet_Hale-Bopp" title="wikilink">Comet Hale-Bopp</a> did the following year. Many European observers in particular did not see the comet at its peak because of unfavourable weather conditions.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>After its close approach to the Earth, the comet faded to about 2nd magnitude. It reached <a href="perihelion" class="uri" title="wikilink">perihelion</a> on <a href="May_1" title="wikilink">May 1</a> <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a>, brightening again and exhibiting a dust tail in addition to the gas tail well seen as it passed the Earth. By this time, however, it was close to the Sun and was not seen as easily. It was observed passing perihelion by the <a href="Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory" title="wikilink">SOHO</a> Sun-observing <a href="satellite" class="uri" title="wikilink">satellite</a>, which also recorded a large <a href="coronal_mass_ejection" title="wikilink">coronal mass ejection</a> being formed at the same time. Its distance from the Sun at perihelion was 0.23 AU, well inside the orbit of <a href="Mercury_(planet)" title="wikilink">Mercury</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>After its perihelion passage, Hyakutake faded rapidly and was lost to naked-eye visibility by the end of May. Its orbital path carried it rapidly into the southern skies; following perihelion, it became much less monitored. The last known ground-based observation of the comet took place on <a href="October_24" title="wikilink">October 24</a>, <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a>, when it was shining at magnitude 16.8 and no longer had an observable coma.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Hyakutake had passed through the inner solar system approximately 17,000 years ago; gravitational interactions with the <a href="gas_giants" title="wikilink">gas giants</a> during its 1996 passage stretched its orbit greatly, and it will not return to the inner <a href="Solar_System" title="wikilink">Solar System</a> again for approximately 72,000 years.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> However, there are conflicting orbital data suggesting a revolutionary period closer to 114,000 years.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="scientific-results">Scientific results</h2>
<h3 id="spacecraft-passes-through-the-tail">Spacecraft passes through the tail</h3>
<p>The <a href="Ulysses_(spacecraft)" title="wikilink">Ulysses spacecraft</a> made an unexpected pass through the tail of the comet on <a href="May_1" title="wikilink">May 1</a> <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Evidence of the encounter was not noticed until 1998. Astronomers analysing old data found that Ulysses' instruments had detected a large drop in the number of <a href="proton" title="wikilink">protons</a> passing, as well as a change in the direction and strength of the local <a href="magnetic_field" title="wikilink">magnetic field</a>. This implied that the spacecraft had crossed the 'wake' of an object, most likely a comet; the object responsible was not immediately identified.</p>
<p>In 2000, two teams independently analyzed the same event. The magnetometer team realized that the changes in the direction of the magnetic field mentioned above agreed with the &quot;draping&quot; pattern expected in a comet's ion, or plasma tail. The magnetometer team looked for likely suspects. No known comets were located near the satellite, but looking further afield, they found that Hyakutake, <a href="1_E11_m" title="wikilink">500 million km</a> away, had crossed Ulysses' orbital plane on <a href="April_23" title="wikilink">April 23</a>, <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a>. The <a href="solar_wind" title="wikilink">solar wind</a> had a velocity at the time of about 750 km/s, at which speed it would have taken eight days for the tail to be carried out to where the spacecraft was situated at 3.73 AU, approximately 45 degrees out of the <a href="ecliptic" class="uri" title="wikilink">ecliptic</a> plane. The orientation of the ion tail inferred from the magnetic field measurements agreed with the source lying in Comet Hyakutake's orbital plane.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The other team, working on data from the spacecraft's ion composition spectrometer, discovered a sudden large spike in detected levels of <a href="ion" title="wikilink">ionised</a> particles at the same time. The relative abundance of chemical elements detected indicated that the object responsible was definitely a comet.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Based on the Ulysses encounter, the comet's tail is known to have been at least 570 million km (360 million <a href="mile" title="wikilink">miles</a>; 3.8 AU) long. This is almost twice as long as the previous longest-known cometary tail, that of the <a href="Great_Comet_of_1843" title="wikilink">Great Comet of 1843</a>, which was 2.2 AU long.</p>
<h3 id="composition">Composition</h3>
<p>Terrestrial observers found <a href="ethane" class="uri" title="wikilink">ethane</a> and <a href="methane" class="uri" title="wikilink">methane</a> in the comet, the first time either of these gases had been detected in a comet. Chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal, which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar space, away from the Sun, which would have evaporated these volatile molecules. Hyakutake's ices must have formed at temperatures of 20 <a href="Kelvin" title="wikilink">K</a> or less, indicating that it probably formed in a denser than average interstellar cloud.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>The amount of <a href="deuterium" class="uri" title="wikilink">deuterium</a> in the comet's <a href="water" class="uri" title="wikilink">water</a> ices was determined through <a href="astronomical_spectroscopy" title="wikilink">spectroscopic</a> observations.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> It was found that the ratio of deuterium to <a href="hydrogen" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a> (known as the D/H ratio) was about 3×10<sup>−4</sup>, which compares to a value in Earth's <a href="ocean" title="wikilink">oceans</a> of about 1.5×10<sup>−4</sup>. It has been proposed that cometary collisions with Earth might have supplied a large proportion of the water in the oceans, but the high D/H ratio measured in Hyakutake and other comets such as Hale-Bopp and <a href="Halley&#39;s_Comet" title="wikilink">Halley's Comet</a> have caused problems for this theory.</p>
<h3 id="x-ray-emission">X-ray emission</h3>

</figure>
<p>One of the great surprises of Hyakutake's passage through the inner solar system was the discovery that it was emitting <a href="X-rays" class="uri" title="wikilink">X-rays</a>, with observations made using the <a href="ROSAT" class="uri" title="wikilink">ROSAT</a> satellite revealing very strong X-ray emission.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> This was the first time a comet had been seen to do so, but astronomers soon found that almost every comet they looked at was emitting X-rays. The emission from Hyakutake was brightest in a crescent shape surrounding the nucleus with the ends of the crescent pointing away from the Sun.</p>
<p>The cause of the X-ray emission is thought to be a combination of several mechanisms. Reflection of solar X-rays is seen in other solar system objects such as the <a href="Moon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moon</a>, but is not able to explain the whole flux from Hyakutake, as the diffuse coma would be an inefficient X-ray reflector. Interactions between energetic solar wind particles and cometary material is also likely to contribute significantly to this effect.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Observations of <a href="Comet_LINEAR" title="wikilink">Comet LINEAR</a> with the <a href="Chandra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chandra</a> satellite in 2000 determined that X-rays observed from that comet were produced predominantly by collisions between <a href="nitrogen" class="uri" title="wikilink">nitrogen</a> and <a href="oxygen" class="uri" title="wikilink">oxygen</a> ions in the solar wind and neutral hydrogen in the comet's coma.</p>

</figure>
<p>Radar results from the <a href="Arecibo_Observatory" title="wikilink">Arecibo Observatory</a> indicated that the nucleus of the comet was about 2 km across, and surrounded by a flurry of <a href="pebble" class="uri" title="wikilink">pebble</a>-sized particles ejected at a few <a href="metre" title="wikilink">metres</a> per <a href="second" class="uri" title="wikilink">second</a>. This size measurement corresponded well with indirect estimates using <a href="infrared" class="uri" title="wikilink">infrared</a> emission and <a href="radio" class="uri" title="wikilink">radio</a> observations.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The small size of the nucleus (<a href="Halley&#39;s_Comet" title="wikilink">Halley's Comet</a> is about 15 km across, while Comet Hale-Bopp was about 40 km across) implies that Hyakutake must have been very active to become as bright as it did. Most comets undergo outgassing from a small proportion of their surface, but most or all of Hyakutake's surface seemed to have been active. The dust production rate was estimated to be about 2×10<sup>3</sup> kg/s at the beginning of March, rising to 3×10<sup>4</sup> kg/s as the comet approached perihelion. During the same period, dust ejection velocities increased from 50 m/s to 500 m/s.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Observations of material being ejected from the nucleus allowed astronomers to establish its rotation period. As the comet passed the earth, a large puff or blob of material was observed being ejected in the sunward direction every 6.23 <a href="hour" title="wikilink">hours</a>. A second smaller ejection with the same period confirmed this as the rotation period of the nucleus.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
