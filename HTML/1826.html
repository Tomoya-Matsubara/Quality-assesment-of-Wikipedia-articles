<p>In the modern <a href="Chinese_language" title="wikilink">Chinese languages</a>, <strong>classifiers</strong> or <strong>measure words</strong> () are used along with numerals to define the quantity of a given object or objects, or with &quot;this&quot;/&quot;that&quot; to identify specific objects. They are a form of <a href="bound_morpheme" title="wikilink">bound morpheme</a>: a morpheme that is always used in conjunction with a <a href="content_word" title="wikilink">content word</a> and does not have any meaning on its own.</p>
<p>In Chinese, a simple numeral cannot quantify a <a href="noun" class="uri" title="wikilink">noun</a> by itself; instead, the language relies on <a href="classifier_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">classifiers</a> (commonly referred to as <a href="measure_word" title="wikilink">measure words</a>).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> When a noun is preceded by a number, a <a href="demonstrative" class="uri" title="wikilink">demonstrative</a> such as <em>this</em> or <em>that</em>, or a <a href="quantifier_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">quantifier</a> such as <em>every</em>, a classifier or measure word must appear directly before the noun.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Thus, while an English speaker may say &quot;one person&quot; or &quot;this person&quot;, a Chinese speaker must say  (<em>y&lt;U+00ED&gt; ge r&lt;U+00E9&gt;n</em>, one-<u>CL</u> person) or  (<em>zh&lt;U+00E8&gt; ge r&lt;U+00E9&gt;n</em>, this-<u>CL</u> person). On the other hand, when a noun is not counted or introduced with a demonstrative, a classifier is not necessary;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> for example, there is a classifier in  (<em>s&lt;U+0101&gt;n li&lt;U+00E0&gt;ng ch&lt;U+0113&gt;</em>, three-<u>CL</u> car, &quot;three cars&quot;) but not in  (<em>w&lt;U+01D2&gt;-de ch&lt;U+0113&gt;</em>, me-possessive car, &quot;my car&quot;). Although classifiers are mandatory after numbers or demonstratives, the use of a number+classifier phrase as opposed to a bare noun is not mandatory, and may be guided more by stylistic or <a href="Pragmatics_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">pragmatic</a> concerns on the part of a speaker.</p>
<p>Different nouns often require different classifiers, based on inherent properties of that noun: for example, many flat objects such as tables, papers, beds, and benches use the classifier  () <em>zh&lt;U+0101&gt;ng</em>, whereas long and thin things use classifiers such as  <em>ti&lt;U+00E1&gt;o</em>,  <em>g&lt;U+0113&gt;n</em>, or  <em>zh&lt;U+012B&gt;</em>. There is, however, a &quot;general classifier&quot;  (), pronounced <em>g&lt;U+00E8&gt;</em> in Mandarin, that may often be used in place of other classifiers; in informal and spoken language, native speakers tend to use this classifier far more than any other, even though they know which classifier is &quot;correct&quot; when asked. In addition to these classifiers, Chinese also has &quot;massifiers&quot;, or words that are not specific to any one objectâ€”for example, the massifier  (<em>h&lt;U+00E9&gt;</em>, &quot;box&quot;) may be used with anything that fits into boxes, such as cigarettes or books, even though those nouns also have their own special classifiers.</p>
<p>Chinese has a large number of such words; estimates of the number of classifiers (including massifiers as well as true classifiers) in <a href="Mandarin_language" title="wikilink">Mandarin</a> alone range from &quot;several dozen&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> or about 50,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> to over 900.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Regular dictionaries tend to include about 120 to 150,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> although it is likely that only a small portion of those (as few as 22) account for the majority of everyday, informal use.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The number of classifiers and the complexity of the classifier system is evident in the fact that there exist numerous specialized &quot;classifier dictionaries&quot;.<ref group=note>Including the following:</p>

<h2 id="types">Types</h2>
<p>There exist both <em>nominal classifiers</em>, used for counting and classifying objects, and <em>verbal classifiers</em>, used for counting and classifying actions. Nominal classifiers, the most common,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> are further subdivided into <em>classifiers</em> and <em>massifiers</em>, described below. In everyday speech, people often use the term &quot;measure word&quot; to cover all Chinese classifiers and massifiers,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and the Chinese term &lt;U+91CF&gt;&lt;U+8BCD&gt;&lt;U+3000&gt;(<em>li&lt;U+00E0&gt;ngc&lt;U+00ED&gt;</em>) itself, which is used like &quot;measure word&quot; in everyday speech, translates as &quot;measuring word&quot;,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> but in actuality the various types of classifiers exhibit numerous differences in meaning, kinds of words they attach to, and other <a href="Syntax" title="wikilink">syntactic</a> behavior.</p>
<h3 id="nominal-classifiers-vs.-massifiers">Nominal: classifiers vs. massifiers</h3>

<p>Linguists generally draw a distinction between &quot;classifiers&quot; proper and &quot;massifiers&quot;. True <strong>classifiers</strong><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> are used for naming or counting instances of a single <a href="count_noun" title="wikilink">count noun</a>,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and have no direct translation in English; for example,  (<em>y&lt;U+00EC&gt; b&lt;U+011B&gt;n sh&lt;U+016B&gt;</em>, one-<u>CL</u> book) can only be translated in English as &quot;one book&quot; or &quot;a book&quot;. Furthermore, these types of classifiers cannot be used with <a href="mass_noun" title="wikilink">mass nouns</a>: just as an English speaker cannot say *&quot;five muds&quot;, a Chinese speaker cannot say * (<em>w&lt;U+01D4&gt; ge n&lt;U+00EC&gt;</em>, five-<u>CL</u> mud). For those kinds of nouns, one must use measure words rather than classifiers.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>True measure words, or &quot;<strong>massifiers</strong>&quot;,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> do not pick out inherent properties of an individual noun like classifiers do; rather, they lump nouns into countable units. Thus, massifiers can generally be used with multiple types of nouns; for example, while the massifier  (<em>h&lt;U+00E9&gt;</em>, &quot;box&quot;) can be used to count boxes of cigarettes ( <em>y&lt;U+00EC&gt; h&lt;U+00E9&gt; y&lt;U+0101&gt;n</em>, &quot;one box of cigarettes&quot;) or of books ( <em>y&lt;U+00EC&gt; h&lt;U+00E9&gt; sh&lt;U+016B&gt;</em>, &quot;one box of books&quot;), each of these nouns must use a different classifier when being counted by itself ( <em>y&lt;U+00EC&gt; g&lt;U+0113&gt;n y&lt;U+0101&gt;n</em> &quot;one cigarette&quot;; vs.  <em>y&lt;U+00EC&gt; b&lt;U+011B&gt;n sh&lt;U+016B&gt;</em> &quot;one book&quot;). While classifiers have no direct English translation, massifiers often do: phrases with classifiers such as  (<em>y&lt;U+00ED&gt; ge r&lt;U+00E9&gt;n</em>, one-<u>CL</u> person) can only be translated as &quot;one person&quot; or &quot;a person&quot;, whereas ones with massifiers such as  (<em>y&lt;U+00EC&gt; q&lt;U+00FA&gt;n r&lt;U+00E9&gt;n</em>, one-crowd-person) can be translated as &quot;a crowd of people&quot;.</p>
<p>Under the heading of &quot;massifiers&quot;, various authors have proposed further subdivisions based on the manner in which a massifier organizes something into units. One of those subdivisions is <em>measurement units</em> (also called &quot;standard measures&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>), which all languages must have in order to measure things&lt;U+2014&gt;for instance, kilometers.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> These classifiers, which generally correspond to measures of length, weight, time, area, volume, etc., can also stand alone without any noun; thus, for example,  <em>b&lt;U+00E0&gt;ng</em> (&quot;pound&quot;) may appear as both  (<em>s&lt;U+0101&gt;n b&lt;U+00E0&gt;ng r&lt;U+00F2&gt;u</em>, &quot;three <u>pounds</u> of meat&quot;) and just  (<em>s&lt;U+0101&gt;n b&lt;U+00E0&gt;ng</em>, &quot;three <u>pounds</u>&quot;); since these classifiers already denote units of measurement, they are not preceded by classifiers of their own even if they are used as nouns (i.e., &quot;three pounds&quot; is never said as * <em>s&lt;U+0101&gt;n ge b&lt;U+00E0&gt;ng</em>).<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Some other proposed subtypes of massifiers include &quot;collective&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> massifiers, such as  (<em>y&lt;U+00EC&gt; q&lt;U+00FA&gt;n r&lt;U+00E9&gt;n</em>, &quot;a <u>group/crowd</u> of people&quot;), which group things less precisely; and &quot;container&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> massifiers, which group things not according to standard measures but by containers they come in, as in  (<em>y&lt;U+00EC&gt; w&lt;U+01CE&gt;n t&lt;U+0101&gt;ng</em>, &quot;a <u>bowl</u> of soup&quot;) or  (<em>y&lt;U+00EC&gt; b&lt;U+0101&gt;o t&lt;U+00E1&gt;ng</em>, &quot;a <u>bag</u> of sugar&quot;).</p>
<p>The difference between true classifiers and measure words has been described as one of categorizing versus quantifying: in other words, massifiers <em>create</em> a unit by which to measure something (i.e., boxes, groups, chunks, pieces, etc.), whereas classifiers simply <em>name</em> an existing item.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In addition to these <a href="Semantics" title="wikilink">semantic</a> differences, there are well-attested differences in the grammatical behaviors of classifiers and massifiers;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> for example, massifiers may be modified by a small set of <a href="adjective" title="wikilink">adjectives</a> (as in  <em>y&lt;U+00ED&gt; d&lt;U+00E0&gt; q&lt;U+00FA&gt;n r&lt;U+00E9&gt;n</em>, &quot;a big crowd of people&quot;), whereas classifiers usually may not (for example, * <em>y&lt;U+00ED&gt; d&lt;U+00E0&gt; ge r&lt;U+00E9&gt;n</em>, intended to mean &quot;a big person&quot;, is never said).<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Another difference is that classifiers may often be replaced by a &quot;general&quot; classifier  (), <em>g&lt;U+00E8&gt;</em> with no change in meaning, whereas massifiers may not.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The syntacticians Lisa Cheng and Rint Sybesma go so far as to propose that classifiers and massifiers have different underlying syntactic structures, with classifiers forming &quot;classifier phrases&quot;,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and massifiers being a sort of <a href="relative_clause" title="wikilink">relative clause</a> that only <em>looks</em> like a classifier phrase.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The distinction between classifiers and massifiers is often fuzzy, however, and some researchers have suggested that classifiers and massifiers may not be so fundamentally different. These researchers posit that classifiers and massifiers are just two extremes on a continuumâ€”that is to say, that actual words may not be one hundred percent classifier or massifier but may fall somewhere in between.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="verbal">Verbal</h3>
<p>The above examples all refer to classifiers and measure words used for counting nouns. There is also a set of measure words that refer to instances of an event or action, as in  (<em>w&lt;U+01D2&gt; q&lt;U+00F9&gt;-guo <strong>li&lt;U+01CE&gt;ng c&lt;U+00EC&gt;</strong> B&lt;U+011B&gt;ij&lt;U+012B&gt;ng</em>, I go-PAST <strong>two-<u>CL</u></strong> Beijing, &quot;I've been to Beijing two <u>times</u>&quot;).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Many of these so-called verbal classifiers<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> are derived from nouns that are related to the activity being counted; for example, the classifier  () <em>p&lt;U+00E1&gt;n</em> for games of chess comes from  () <em>p&lt;U+00E1&gt;nzi</em>, the word for a tray (on which chess is played), and the general classifier for events  () <em>ch&lt;U+01CE&gt;ng</em> also means &quot;arena&quot; or &quot;field&quot;.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="relation-to-nouns">Relation to nouns</h2>
<p>The Chinese languages each have a very large number of nominal classifiers, and different classifiers often correspond to different particular nouns. For example, books take the classifier  <em>b&lt;U+011B&gt;n</em>, flat things take  () <em>zh&lt;U+0101&gt;ng</em>, animals take  () <em>zh&lt;U+012B&gt;</em>, machines take  <em>t&lt;U+00E1&gt;i</em>, large buildings or geographical features take  <em>zu&lt;U+00F2&gt;</em>, etc. Within these divisions are even further subdivisions&lt;U+2014&gt;while most animals take  <em>zh&lt;U+012B&gt;</em>, domestic animals take  <em>t&lt;U+00F3&gt;u</em>, long and flexible animals take  <em>ti&lt;U+00E1&gt;o</em>, and horses take  <em>p&lt;U+012B&gt;</em>. Likewise, while long things that are flexible often take  <em>ti&lt;U+00E1&gt;o</em>, long things that are rigid take  <em>g&lt;U+0113&gt;n</em>, unless they are also round, in which case in some dialects they take  <em>zh&lt;U+012B&gt;</em>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Classifiers also vary in just how specific they are; some (such as  <em>du&lt;U+01D2&gt;</em> for flowers) only are used with more or less one item, whereas others (such as  <em>ti&lt;U+00E1&gt;o</em> for long and flexible things, one-dimensional things, or abstract items like news reports<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a>) are much less restricted.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The specific factors that govern which classifiers are paired with which nouns have been a subject of debate among linguists.</p>
<h3 id="categories-vs.-prototypes">Categories vs. prototypes</h3>
<p>While massifiers do not necessarily bear any semantic relationship to the noun with which they are used (i.e., <em>box</em> and <em>book</em> are not related in meaning, but one can still say &quot;a box of books&quot;), classifiers do.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The precise nature of that relationship, however, is not certain, since there is so much variability in how objects may be organized and categorized by classifiers. Accounts of the semantic relationship may be grouped loosely into <em>categorical</em> theories, which propose that classifiers are matched to objects solely on the basis of inherent features of those objects (such as length or size); and <em>prototypical</em> theories, which propose that people learn to match a classifier to a specific &quot;prototypical&quot; object and to other objects that are like that prototype.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The categorical, &quot;<a href="Categories_(Aristotle)" title="wikilink">classical</a>&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> theory of classifiers was that each classifier represents a category with a set of &quot;conditions&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;for example, the classifier  <em>ti&lt;U+00E1&gt;o</em> would represent a category defined as all objects that meet the conditions of being long, thin, and one-dimensional&lt;U+2014&gt;and nouns using that classifier must fit all the conditions with which the category is associated. Some common semantic categories into which classifiers have been claimed to group nouns include categories of shape (long, flat, or round), size (large or small), consistency (soft or hard), <a href="animacy" class="uri" title="wikilink">animacy</a> (human, animal, or object),<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> and function (tools, vehicles, machines, etc.).<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>On the other hand, proponents of <a href="prototype_theory" title="wikilink">prototype theory</a> propose that classifiers may not have innate definitions, but are associated with a noun that is &quot;prototypical&quot; of that category, and nouns that have a &quot;family resemblance&quot; with the prototype noun will want to use the same classifier.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> For example, <em>horse</em> in Chinese uses the classifier  <em>p&lt;U+012B&gt;</em>, as in  (<em>s&lt;U+0101&gt;n p&lt;U+012B&gt; m&lt;U+01CE&gt;</em>, &quot;three horses&quot;)&lt;U+2014&gt;in modern Chinese the word  has no meaning. Nevertheless, nouns denoting animals that look like horses will often also use this same classifier, and native speakers have been found to be more likely to use the classifier  the closer an animal looks to a horse.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Furthermore, words that do not meet the &quot;criteria&quot; of a semantic category may still use that category because of their <a href="association_(psychology)" title="wikilink">association</a> with a prototype. For example, the classifier  () <em>k&lt;U+00E8&gt;</em> is used for small round items, as in  (<em>y&lt;U+00ED&gt; k&lt;U+00E8&gt; z&lt;U+01D0&gt;d&lt;U+00E0&gt;n</em>, &quot;one bullet&quot;); when words like  (<em>yu&lt;U+00E1&gt;nz&lt;U+01D0&gt;d&lt;U+00E0&gt;n</em>, &quot;atomic bomb&quot;) were later introduced into the language they also used this classifier, even though they are not small and round&lt;U+2014&gt;therefore, their classifier must have been assigned because of the words' association with the word for bullet, which acted as a &quot;prototype&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> This is an example of &quot;generalization&quot; from prototypes: linguist Mary Erbaugh has proposed that when people learning classifiers, they go through a set of stages, first learning a classifier-noun pair only (such as  <em>ti&lt;U+00E1&gt;o y&lt;U+00FA&gt;</em>, <u>CL</u>-fish), then using that classifier with multiple nouns that are similar to the prototype (such as other types of fish), then finally using that set of nouns to generalize a semantic feature associated with the classifier (such as longness and flexibility) so that the classifier can then be used with new words that the person encounters.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Some classifier-noun pairings are entirely <a href="arbitrariness" title="wikilink">arbitrary</a>, or at least appear to modern speakers to have no semantic motivation.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> For instance, the classifier  <em>b&lt;U+00F9&gt;</em> may be used for movies and novels, but also for cars.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Some of this arbitrariness may be due to what linguist James Tai refers to as &quot;fossilization&quot;, whereby a classifier loses its meaning through historical changes but remains paired with some nouns&lt;U+2014&gt;for example, the classifier  <em>p&lt;U+012B&gt;</em> used for horses is meaningless today, but in <a href="Classical_Chinese" title="wikilink">Classical Chinese</a> may have had something to do with a &quot;team of two horses&quot;,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> a pair of horse skeletons,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a>, or the pairing between man and horse.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Arbitrariness may also arise when a classifier is <a href="Loanword" title="wikilink">borrowed</a>, along with its noun, from a dialect in which it has a clear meaning to one in which it doesn't.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> In both these cases, the use of the classifier is remembered more by association with certain &quot;prototypical&quot; nouns (such as <em>horse</em>) rather than by understanding of semantic categories, and thus arbitrariness has been used as an argument in favor of the prototype theory of classifiers.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="neutralization">Neutralization</h3>
<p>In addition to all the numerous &quot;specific&quot; classifiers,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Chinese also has a &quot;general&quot; classifier  (), pronounced <em>g&lt;U+00E8&gt;</em> in Mandarin.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> This classifier is used for people, some abstract concepts, and other words that do not have special classifiers (such as &lt;U+6C49&gt;&lt;U+5821&gt;&lt;U+628A&gt; <em>h&lt;U+00E0&gt;nb&lt;U+0101&gt;ob&lt;U+0101&gt;o</em> &quot;hamburger&quot;),<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> and may also be used as a replacement for a specific classifier such as  () <em>zh&lt;U+0101&gt;ng</em> or  <em>ti&lt;U+00E1&gt;o</em>, especially in informal speech. It has been noted as early as the 1940s that the use of  is increasing and there is a general &quot;trend&quot; towards replacing other classifiers with it,<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> and numerous empirical studies have reported that both adults and children tend to use  when they don't know the appropriate classifier for a word, or even when they do but are speaking quickly or informally.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The replacement of a specific classifier with the general  is known as classifier <em>neutralization</em>,<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> and occurs especially often among children<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> and <a href="Aphasia" title="wikilink">aphasics</a> (individuals with damage to language-relevant areas of the brain),<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> but normal speakers also frequently neutralize frequently. It has been reported that most speakers know the appropriate classifiers for the words they are using and believe, when asked, that those classifiers are obligatory, but in actual speech often use  without even realizing it.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> In other words, when asked what the appropriate classifier is for a given word, speakers will answer correctly, but in regular speech they are very likely to use the general classifier, which Erbaugh claims is &quot;hundreds of times more frequent&quot; in everyday use.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>Nevertheless,  has not completely replaced other classifiers, and there are still many situations in which it would be inappropriate to substitute it for the specific classifier required.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> There may be specific patterns to which classifier-noun pairs may be &quot;neutralized&quot; to use the general classifier, and which may not&lt;U+2014&gt;for example, words that are most prototypical for their categories, such as <em>paper</em> for the category of nouns taking the &quot;flat/square&quot; classifier  () <em>zh&lt;U+0101&gt;ng</em>, may be less likely to be said with a general classifier.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="variation-in-usage">Variation in usage</h3>
<p>There is not a one-to-one pairing between classifiers and nouns. Across dialects and speakers there is massive variability in what classifiers are used for the same words, and speakers often do not agree which classifier is best.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> For example, for cars some people use  <em>b&lt;U+00F9&gt;</em>, others use  <em>t&lt;U+00E1&gt;i</em>, and still others use  () <em>li&lt;U+00E0&gt;ng</em>, or in Cantonese  . Even within dialects or within the same speaker, the same noun may take multiple different measure words depending on the style in which the person is speaking, or on different nuances the person wants to convey; for example, the word for person,  <em>r&lt;U+00E9&gt;n</em>, uses the measure word  <em>g&lt;U+00E8&gt;</em> normally, but uses the measure  <em>k&lt;U+01D2&gt;u</em> when counting number of people in a household, and  <em>w&lt;U+00E8&gt;i</em> when being particularly polite or honorific, and  <em>m&lt;U+00ED&gt;ng</em> in formal, written contexts.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Some classifiers may also be used with nouns that they are not normally related to, for metaphorical effect, as in  (<em>y&lt;U+00ED&gt; du&lt;U+00EC&gt; f&lt;U+00E1&gt;nn&lt;U+01CE&gt;o</em>, &quot;a <u>pile</u> of worries/troubles&quot;).<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Finally, a single word may have multiple classifiers that convey different outright meanings&lt;U+2014&gt;in fact, the choice of a classifier can even change the lexical meaning of a noun. For example,  <em>y&lt;U+00ED&gt; zu&lt;U+00F2&gt; l&lt;U+00F3&gt;u</em> means &quot;one building&quot;, whereas  <em>y&lt;U+00ED&gt; c&lt;U+00E9&gt;ng l&lt;U+00F3&gt;u</em> means &quot;one floor (of a building)&quot;.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="OracleShell.JPG" title="fig:Oracle bone inscriptions, such as this one from the Sh&lt;U+0101&gt;ng Dynasty, provide some of the earliest examples of the number phrases that may have eventually spawned Chinese classifiers and massifiers." alt="Oracle bone inscriptions, such as this one from the Sh&lt;U+0101&gt;ng Dynasty, provide some of the earliest examples of the number phrases that may have eventually spawned Chinese classifiers and massifiers." /> <a href="Historical_linguistics" title="wikilink">Historical linguists</a> have found that number-plus-noun phrases in <a href="Old_Chinese" title="wikilink">Old Chinese</a> and <a href="Middle_Chinese" title="wikilink">Middle Chinese</a> went through several different phases before classifiers appeared in them. The earliest forms may have been <em>NumberÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; Noun</em>, like English (i.e., &quot;five horses&quot;), and the less common <em>NounÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; Number</em> (&quot;horses five&quot;), both of which are attested in the <a href="oracle_bone_script" title="wikilink">oracle bone scripts</a> of Pre-Archaic (circa 14th century BCE to 11th century BCE) Chinese.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The first constructions resembling classifier constructions were <em>NounÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; NumberÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; Noun</em> constructions that were also extant in Pre-Archaic Chinese, but less common than the <em>NumberÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; Noun</em> construction; in these constructions, sometimes the first and second nouns were identical (<em>N1Â &lt;U+2014&gt; NumÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; N1</em>, as in &quot;horses five horses&quot;) and other times the second noun was different, but semantically related (<em>N1Â &lt;U+2014&gt; NumÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; N2</em>). According to some researchers, the <em>N2</em> in these constructions can be considered an early form of classifier and have even been called &quot;echo classifiers&quot;; this speculation is not universally agreed on, though.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Although classifiers had not appeared yet, <em>massifiers</em> were common in this time, with constructions such as &quot;wineÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; sixÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; <u><em>you</em></u>&quot; (the word <em>you</em> represented a wine container) meaning &quot;six <em>you</em> of wine&quot;;<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> this suggests that massifiers began to be used several centuries before classifiers, although the word order was not the same as it is today.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>It is from this type of structure that classifiers may have arisen, originally replacing the second noun (in structures where there was a noun rather than a massifier) to yield <em>NounÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; NumberÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; Classifier</em>. In other words, constructions like &quot;horses five horses&quot; may have been replaced by ones like &quot;horses five <u>CL</u>&quot;), possibly for stylistic issues such as avoiding repetition).<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Another reason for the appearance of classifiers may have been to avoid confusion or ambiguity that could have arisen from counting items using only massifiers&lt;U+2014&gt;i.e., to clarify when one is referring to a single item and when one is referring to a measure of items.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>What is certain is that at some point in history the order of words in this construction shifted, putting the noun at the end rather than beginning, like in the present day construction <em>NumberÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; ClassifierÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; Noun</em>.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> According to historical linguist Alain Peyraube, the earliest occurrences of this construction (albeit with massifiers, rather than classifiers, in the front of the phrase) appear in the late portion of <a href="Old_Chinese" title="wikilink">Old Chinese</a> (5th century BCE to 3rc century BCE), where the <em>NumberÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; Massifier</em> portion of the <em>NounÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; NumberÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; Massifier</em> construction is occasionally shifted in front of the noun. He speculates that this may have occurred because it was gradually reanalyzed as a <a href="modifier_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">modifier</a> (like an adjective) for the head noun, as opposed to a simple repetition like it originally was; since Chinese generally places modifiers before modified, like English does, then this reanalysis may have been what prompted the shift. By the early part of the <a href="Common_Era" title="wikilink">Common Era</a>, the nouns appearing after numbers were beginning to lose their meaning and become true classifiers, and linguist Liu Shiru estimates proposes the classifier system underwent significant development during the <a href="Southern_and_Northern_Dynasties" title="wikilink">Weijin Nanbei Chao</a> period from the 3rd to 6th century,<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> although the use of classifiers did not become frequent until at least the 7th century, during the <a href="Tang_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Tang Dynasty</a>.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> They began to be grammatically mandatory sometime around the 11th century.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>Classifier systems in many nearby languages and language groups (such as <a href="Vietnamese_language" title="wikilink">Vietnamese</a> and the <a href="Tai_languages" title="wikilink">Tai languages</a>) are very similar to the Chinese classifier system in both grammatical structure and the parameters along which some objects are grouped together. Thus, there has been some debate over which language family first developed classifiers and which ones then borrowed them&lt;U+2014&gt;or whether classifier systems were native to all these languages and developed more through repeated <a href="language_contact" title="wikilink">language contact</a> throughout history.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> This is still an open question, however.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="classifiers-themselves">Classifiers themselves</h3>

<p>Most modern classifiers are derived from words that originally were free-standing nouns in older varieties of Chinese, and have since been <a href="Grammaticalization" title="wikilink">grammaticalized</a> to become <a href="bound_morphemes" title="wikilink">bound morphemes</a>.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> In other words, classifiers tend to come from words that once had specific meaning but lost it (a process known as <a href="semantic_bleaching" title="wikilink">semantic bleaching</a>).<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Many, however, still have related forms that work as nouns all by themselves, such as the classifier  <em>d&lt;U+00E0&gt;i</em> for long, ribbon-like objects: the modern word  <em>d&lt;U+00E0&gt;izi</em> means &quot;ribbon&quot;.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Massifiers, on the other hand, are more transparent in meaning than classifiers; while the latter have some historical <a href="Etymology" title="wikilink">etymological</a> meaning, the former are still full-fledged nouns.  <em>b&lt;U+0113&gt;i</em>, for example, is not just a classifier (for cups of things, as in  <em>y&lt;U+00EC&gt; b&lt;U+0113&gt;i ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;</em> &quot;a cup of tea&quot;), but is also the word for a cup.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>It may not have always been the case that every noun required a classifier; in many historical varieties of Chinese, use of classifiers was not mandatory, and classifiers are rare in writings that have survived.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Some nouns acquired classifiers earlier than others; some of the first documented uses of classifiers were for inventorying items, both in mercantile business and in storytelling.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Thus, the first nouns to have classifiers paired with them may have been nouns that represent &quot;culturally valued&quot; items such as horses (important in ancient warfare), scrolls, and intellectuals.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> The special status of such items is still apparent today: many of the classifiers that can only be paired with one or two nouns, such as  <em>p&lt;U+01D0&gt;</em> for horses and  <em>sh&lt;U+01D2&gt;u</em> for songs or poems, are the classifiers for just these &quot;valued&quot; items. Such classifiers make up as much as one-third of the commonly used classifiers today.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>Much research on classifier systems in general, and Chinese classifiers in particular, has raised the question of why classifiers (as opposed to massifiers) exist at all. Massifiers are present in all languages since they are the only way to &quot;count&quot; mass nouns that are not naturally divided into units (for example, English speakers &quot;three <u>splotches</u> of mud&quot; because <em>mud</em> is a mass noun and *&quot;three muds&quot; is ungrammatical); classifiers, on the other hand, are not inherently &quot;necessary&quot; and thus only exist in a small set of languages.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Furthermore, classifiers are used with an &quot;unexpectedly low frequency&quot;;<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> in many discourse settings, speakers are reported to avoid classifiers by just using a bare noun (without a number or demonstrative) or using the general classifier  <em>g&lt;U+00E8&gt;</em>.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Researchers such as <a href="Joseph_Greenberg" title="wikilink">Joseph Greenberg</a> have suggested that specific classifiers are semantically &quot;redundant&quot;, since they repeat information that is already present within the noun.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Classifiers can, however, be used stylistically,<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> and can also be used to clarify or limit a speaker's intended meaning when using a vague or ambiguous noun&lt;U+2014&gt;for example, the noun  <em>k&lt;U+00E8&gt;</em> &quot;class&quot; can refer to courses in a semester or specific class periods during a day, depending on whether the classifier  <em>m&lt;U+00E9&gt;n</em> or <em>ji&lt;U+00E9&gt;</em> is used.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>Many authors have assumed that classifiers serve more of a cognitive purpose than a practical one&lt;U+2014&gt;i.e., they provide a linguistic way for speakers to organize or categorize objects in the world.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> On the other hand, some investigations of when classifiers are used and when they are not has suggested that classifiers may serve more of a <a href="discourse" title="wikilink">discursive</a> and <a href="pragmatics_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">pragmatic</a> function&lt;U+2014&gt;in other words, a communicative function when people interact, rather than an abstract function within the mind.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Specifically, it has been proposed that classifiers might be used to mark new or unfamiliar objects within a discourse,<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> to introduce major characters or items (as opposed to minor characters or items) in a story or conversation,<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> or to <a href="focus_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">foreground</a> important information and objects by making them bigger and more <a href="salience_(semiotics)" title="wikilink">salient</a>.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> In this way, classifiers might not serve a real grammatical or cognitive function, but may help in communication by making important information more noticeable and drawing attention to it.</p>

A classifier may be placed <em>after</em> a noun, rather than before, to convey a plural sense: i.e.,  (<em>y&lt;U+00ED&gt; b&lt;U+011B&gt;n sh&lt;U+016B&gt;</em>, one-<u>CL</u> book) means &quot;one book&quot;, but  (<em>sh&lt;U+016B&gt;-b&lt;U+011B&gt;n</em>, book-<u>CL</u>) means &quot;the books&quot; (for example, &quot;all the books in the library&quot; or &quot;all the books on the shelf&quot;).<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Similar, many classifiers may be <a href="Reduplication" title="wikilink">reduplicated</a> to mean &quot;every&quot;, as in  (<em>g&lt;U+00E8&gt;-ge r&lt;U+00E9&gt;n</em>, <u>CL</u>-<u>CL</u> person, &quot;every person&quot;).<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Furthermore, a classifier may be used along with the word &quot;one&quot;, after a noun, to mean approximately &quot;all of&quot;, &quot;the entire&quot;, or &quot;a ___ful of&quot;,<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> as in  (<em>ti&lt;U+0101&gt;nk&lt;U+014D&gt;ng y&lt;U+00ED&gt; pi&lt;U+00E0&gt;n y&lt;U+00FA&gt;n</em>, sky one-<u>CL</u> cloud), which means &quot;the sky was full of clouds&quot;, where  <em>pi&lt;U+00E0&gt;n</em> &quot;slice&quot; is the classifier used for the sky.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn40">The theory described in  and  is also referred to within those works as a &quot;prototype&quot; theory, but differs somewhat from the version of prototype theory described here; rather than claiming that individual prototypes are the <em>source</em> for classifier meanings, these authors that classifiers still are based on categories with features, but that the categories have many features, and &quot;prototypes&quot; are words that have all the features of that category whereas other words in the category only have some features. In other words, &quot;there are core and marginal members of a category.... a member of a category does not necessarily possess all the properties of that category&quot; . For instance, the classifier  <em>k&lt;U+00E8&gt;</em> is used for the category of trees, which may have features such as &quot;has a trunk&quot;, &quot;has leaves&quot;, &quot;has branches&quot;, &quot;is deciduous&quot;; maple trees would be prototypes of the category, since they have all these features, whereas palm trees only have a trunk and leaves and thus are not prototypical .<a href="#fnref40" class="footnote-back">â†©</a></li>
