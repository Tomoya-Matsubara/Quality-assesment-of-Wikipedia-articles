<p><strong>Edward Teller</strong> (; January 15, 1908 &lt;U+2013&gt; September 9, 2003) was a <a href="Hungarian_American" title="wikilink">Hungarian-born American</a> <a href="theoretical_physicist" title="wikilink">theoretical physicist</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> known colloquially as &quot;the father of the <a href="hydrogen_bomb" title="wikilink">hydrogen bomb</a>&quot;, even though he claimed he did not care for the title.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Teller made numerous contributions to <a href="nuclear_physics" title="wikilink">nuclear</a> and <a href="molecular_physics" title="wikilink">molecular physics</a>, <a href="spectroscopy" class="uri" title="wikilink">spectroscopy</a> (the <a href="Jahn&lt;U+2013&gt;Teller_effect" title="wikilink">Jahn&lt;U+2013&gt;Teller</a> and <a href="Renner&lt;U+2013&gt;Teller_effect" title="wikilink">Renner&lt;U+2013&gt;Teller</a> effects), and <a href="surface" class="uri" title="wikilink">surface</a> physics. His extension of Fermi's theory of <a href="beta_decay" title="wikilink">beta decay</a> (in the form of the so-called <a href="Gamow-Teller_Transition" title="wikilink">Gamow&lt;U+2013&gt;Teller transitions</a>) provided an important stepping stone in the applications of this theory. The Jahn&lt;U+2013&gt;Teller effect and the <a href="BET_theory" title="wikilink">BET theory</a> have retained their original formulation and are still mainstays in physics and chemistry.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Teller also made contributions to <a href="Thomas&lt;U+2013&gt;Fermi_model" title="wikilink">Thomas&lt;U+2013&gt;Fermi theory</a>, the precursor of <a href="density_functional_theory" title="wikilink">density functional theory</a>, a standard modern tool in the quantum mechanical treatment of complex molecules. In 1953, along with <a href="Nicholas_Metropolis" title="wikilink">Nicholas Metropolis</a> and <a href="Marshall_Rosenbluth" title="wikilink">Marshall Rosenbluth</a>, Teller co-authored a paper<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> which is a standard starting point for the applications of the <a href="Monte_Carlo_method" title="wikilink">Monte Carlo method</a> to <a href="statistical_mechanics" title="wikilink">statistical mechanics</a>.</p>
<p>Teller emigrated to the United States in the 1930s, and was an early member of the <a href="Manhattan_Project" title="wikilink">Manhattan Project</a> charged with developing the first atomic bombs. During this time he made a serious push to develop the first <a href="nuclear_fusion" title="wikilink">fusion</a>-based weapons as well, but these were deferred until after <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. After his controversial testimony in the <a href="security_clearance" title="wikilink">security clearance</a> hearing of his former <a href="Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Los Alamos</a> colleague <a href="J._Robert_Oppenheimer" title="wikilink">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>, Teller was ostracized by much of the scientific community. He continued to find support from the U.S. government and military research establishment, particularly for his advocacy for <a href="nuclear_power" title="wikilink">nuclear energy</a> development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous <a href="nuclear_testing" title="wikilink">nuclear testing</a> program. He was a co-founder of <a href="Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> (LLNL), and was both its director and associate director for many years.</p>
<p>In his later years he became especially known for his advocacy of controversial technological solutions to both military and civilian problems, including a plan to excavate an artificial harbor in Alaska using <a href="thermonuclear" class="uri" title="wikilink">thermonuclear</a> explosive in what was called <a href="Project_Chariot" title="wikilink">Project Chariot</a>. He was a vigorous advocate of <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Reagan</a>'s <a href="Strategic_Defense_Initiative" title="wikilink">Strategic Defense Initiative</a>. Throughout his life, Teller was known both for his scientific ability and his difficult interpersonal relations and volatile personality, and is considered one of the inspirations for the character <a href="Dr._Strangelove#Peter_Sellers&#39;_multiple_roles" title="wikilink">Dr. Strangelove</a> in the <a href="Dr._Strangelove" title="wikilink">1964 movie of the same name</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-and-education">Early life and education</h2>
<p>Teller was born in <a href="Budapest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Budapest</a>, Hungary (then <a href="Austria-Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria-Hungary</a>), into a Jewish family, in the year 1908. His parents were Ilona (Deutsch), a pianist, and Max Teller, an attorney.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> When he was very young, his grandfather told his mother not to be too unhappy that he was apparently an <a href="idiot" class="uri" title="wikilink">idiot</a>, because he hadn't spoken by the age of three. A doctor suggested he might be mentally retarded. Teller had no interest in speaking because his father spoke Hungarian and very poor German, and his mother spoke German and very poor Hungarian. As a result, he decided that they didn't know what they were talking about. Despite being raised in a Jewish family, he later on became an agnostic.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He became very interested in numbers, and would calculate in his head large numbers, such as the number of seconds in a year.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>He left Hungary in 1926 (partly due to the <em><a href="numerus_clausus" title="wikilink">numerus clausus</a></em> rule under <a href="Mikl&lt;U+00F3&gt;s_Horthy" title="wikilink">Horthy</a>'s regime). The <a href="Hungary_between_the_World_Wars" title="wikilink">political climate and revolutions in Hungary</a> during his youth instilled a lingering animosity for both Communism and Fascism in Teller.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> When he was a young student, his right foot was severed in a streetcar accident in <a href="Munich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Munich</a>, requiring him to wear a <a href="prosthetic" class="uri" title="wikilink">prosthetic</a> foot and leaving him with a lifelong limp. Teller graduated in <a href="chemical_engineering" title="wikilink">chemical engineering</a> at the <a href="University_of_Karlsruhe" title="wikilink">University of Karlsruhe</a> and received his Ph.D. in <a href="physics" class="uri" title="wikilink">physics</a> under <a href="Werner_Heisenberg" title="wikilink">Werner Heisenberg</a> at the <a href="University_of_Leipzig" title="wikilink">University of Leipzig</a>. Teller's Ph.D. <a href="dissertation" class="uri" title="wikilink">dissertation</a> dealt with one of the first accurate <a href="quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum mechanical</a> treatments of the <a href="hydrogen_molecular_ion" title="wikilink">hydrogen molecular ion</a>. In 1930 he befriended Russian physicists <a href="George_Gamow" title="wikilink">George Gamow</a> and <a href="Lev_Landau" title="wikilink">Lev Landau</a>. Teller's lifelong friendship with a <a href="Czechs" title="wikilink">Czech</a> physicist, <a href="George_Placzek" title="wikilink">George Placzek</a>, was very important for Teller's scientific and philosophical development. It was Placzek who arranged a summer stay in <a href="Rome,_Italy" title="wikilink">Rome</a> with <a href="Enrico_Fermi" title="wikilink">Enrico Fermi</a> for young Teller, thus orienting his scientific career in nuclear physics.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Teller spent two years at the <a href="University_of_G&lt;U+00F6&gt;ttingen" title="wikilink">University of G&lt;U+00F6&gt;ttingen</a>, and left in 1933 through the aid of the <a href="International_Rescue_Committee" title="wikilink">International Rescue Committee</a>. He went briefly to England, and moved for a year to <a href="Copenhagen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Copenhagen</a>, where he worked under <a href="Niels_Bohr" title="wikilink">Niels Bohr</a>. In February 1934, he married Augusta Maria &quot;Mici&quot; (pronounced &quot;Mitzi&quot;) Harkanyi, the sister of a longtime friend.</p>
<p>In 1935, thanks to George Gamow's incentive, Teller was invited to the United States to become a Professor of Physics at <a href="George_Washington_University" title="wikilink">George Washington University</a> (GWU), where he worked with Gamow until 1941. Prior to the discovery of <a href="Nuclear_fission" title="wikilink">fission</a> in 1939, Teller was engaged as a theoretical physicist, working in the fields of quantum, <a href="molecular_physics" title="wikilink">molecular</a>, and <a href="nuclear_physics" title="wikilink">nuclear physics</a>. In 1941, after becoming a <a href="naturalized" class="uri" title="wikilink">naturalized</a> citizen of the United States, his interest turned to the use of nuclear energy, both <a href="Nuclear_fusion" title="wikilink">fusion</a> and fission.</p>
<p><img src="Edward_Teller_(boy).jpg" title="fig:Teller in his youth" alt="Teller in his youth" width="150" /> At GWU, Teller predicted the <a href="Jahn&lt;U+2013&gt;Teller_effect" title="wikilink">Jahn&lt;U+2013&gt;Teller effect</a> (1937), which distorts molecules in certain situations; this affects the <a href="chemical_reaction" title="wikilink">chemical reactions</a> of metals, and in particular the coloration of certain metallic dyes. Teller and <a href="Hermann_Arthur_Jahn" title="wikilink">Hermann Arthur Jahn</a> analyzed it as a piece of purely mathematical physics. In collaboration with Brunauer and Emmet, Teller also made an important contribution to <a href="Surface_science" title="wikilink">surface physics and chemistry</a>: the so-called <a href="BET_theory" title="wikilink">Brunauer&lt;U+2013&gt;Emmett&lt;U+2013&gt;Teller (BET) isotherm</a>.<ref>Journal of the American Chemical Society,</p>
<p><code>60 (2) , pp. 309&lt;U+2013&gt;319 (1938).</code></ref></p>
<p>When <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> began, Teller wanted to contribute to the war effort. On the advice of the well-known <a href="Caltech" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caltech</a> <a href="aerodynamicist" class="uri" title="wikilink">aerodynamicist</a> and fellow Hungarian <a href="&lt;U+00E9&gt;migr&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00E9&gt;migr&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> <a href="Theodore_von_K&lt;U+00E1&gt;rm&lt;U+00E1&gt;n" title="wikilink">Theodore von K&lt;U+00E1&gt;rm&lt;U+00E1&gt;n</a>, Teller collaborated with his friend <a href="Hans_Bethe" title="wikilink">Hans Bethe</a> in developing a theory of shock-wave propagation. In later years, their explanation of the behavior of the gas behind such a wave proved valuable to scientists who were studying <a href="missile" class="uri" title="wikilink">missile</a> re-entry.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="manhattan-project">Manhattan Project</h2>

<p>In 1942, Teller was invited to be part of <a href="Robert_Oppenheimer" title="wikilink">Robert Oppenheimer</a>'s summer planning seminar at the <a href="University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="wikilink">University of California, Berkeley</a> for the origins of the <a href="Manhattan_Project" title="wikilink">Manhattan Project</a>, the <a href="Allies_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">Allied</a> effort to develop the first <a href="nuclear_weapon" title="wikilink">nuclear weapons</a>. A few weeks earlier, Teller had been meeting with his friend and colleague <a href="Enrico_Fermi" title="wikilink">Enrico Fermi</a> about the prospects of <a href="Nuclear_warfare" title="wikilink">atomic warfare</a>, and Fermi had nonchalantly suggested that perhaps a weapon based on <a href="nuclear_fission" title="wikilink">nuclear fission</a> could be used to set off an even larger <a href="nuclear_fusion" title="wikilink">nuclear fusion</a> reaction. Even though he initially explained to Fermi why he thought the idea would not work, Teller was fascinated by the possibility and was quickly bored with the idea of &quot;just&quot; an atomic bomb (even though this was not yet anywhere near completion). At the Berkeley session, Teller diverted discussion from the fission weapon to the possibility of a fusion weapon&lt;U+2014&gt;what he called the &quot;Super&quot; (an early version of what was later to be known as a hydrogen bomb).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>On December 6, 1941, the United States had begun development of the atomic bomb, under the supervision of <a href="Arthur_Compton" title="wikilink">Arthur Compton</a>, chairman of the <a href="University_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">University of Chicago</a> physics department, who coordinated <a href="uranium" class="uri" title="wikilink">uranium</a> research with <a href="Columbia_University" title="wikilink">Columbia University</a>, <a href="Princeton_University" title="wikilink">Princeton University</a>, University of Chicago, and <a href="University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="wikilink">University of California, Berkeley</a>. Eventually Compton transferred the Columbia and Princeton scientists to the <a href="Metallurgical_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Metallurgical Laboratory</a> at Chicago, and Enrico Fermi moved in at the end of April 1942 and the construction of <a href="Chicago_Pile_1" title="wikilink">Chicago Pile 1</a> began. Teller was left behind at first, but then called to Chicago two months later. In early 1943, the <a href="Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Los Alamos laboratory</a> was built to design an <a href="atomic_bomb" title="wikilink">atomic bomb</a> under the supervision of Oppenheimer in <a href="Los_Alamos,_New_Mexico" title="wikilink">Los Alamos, New Mexico</a>. Teller moved there in April 1943.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Edward_Teller_ID_badge.png" title="fig:Teller&#39;s ID badge photo from Los Alamos" alt="Teller&#39;s ID badge photo from Los Alamos" width="150" /> Teller became part of the Theoretical Physics division at the then-secret <a href="Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Los Alamos laboratory</a> during the war, and continued to push his ideas for a fusion weapon even though it had been put on a low priority during the war (as the creation of a fission weapon was proving to be difficult enough by itself). Because of his interest in the H-bomb, and his frustration at having been passed over for director of the theoretical division (the job was instead given to <a href="Hans_Bethe" title="wikilink">Hans Bethe</a>), Teller refused to engage in the calculations for the <a href="Nuclear_weapon_design#Implosion_type_weapon" title="wikilink">implosion mechanism</a> of the fission bomb. This caused tensions with other researchers, as additional scientists had to be employed to do that work&lt;U+2014&gt;including <a href="Klaus_Fuchs" title="wikilink">Klaus Fuchs</a>, who was later revealed to be a <a href="espionage" title="wikilink">Soviet spy</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Apparently, Teller managed to also irk his neighbors by playing the piano late in the night.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> However, Teller made valuable contributions to bomb research, especially in the elucidation of the implosion mechanism. He also was one of the few scientists to actually watch (with eye protection) the first test detonation in July 1945, rather than follow orders to lie on the ground with backs turned. He later said that the atomic flash &quot;was as if I had pulled open the curtain in a dark room and broad daylight streamed in.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1946, Teller participated in a conference in which the properties of thermonuclear fuels such as <a href="deuterium" class="uri" title="wikilink">deuterium</a> and the possible design of a hydrogen bomb were discussed. It was concluded that Teller's assessment of a hydrogen bomb had been too favourable, and that both the quantity of deuterium needed, as well as the radiation losses during <a href="deuterium_burning" title="wikilink">deuterium burning</a>, would shed doubt on its workability. Addition of expensive <a href="tritium" class="uri" title="wikilink">tritium</a> to the thermonuclear mixture would likely lower its ignition temperature, but even so, nobody knew at that time how much tritium would be needed, and whether even tritium addition would encourage heat propagation. At the end of the conference, in spite of opposition by some members such as <a href="Robert_Serber" title="wikilink">Robert Serber</a>, Teller submitted an unduly optimistic report in which he said that a hydrogen bomb was feasible, and that further work should be encouraged on its development. Fuchs had also participated in this conference, and transmitted this information to Moscow. The model of Teller's &quot;classical Super&quot; was so uncertain that Oppenheimer would later say that he wished the Russians were building their own hydrogen bomb based on that design, so that it would almost certainly retard their progress on it.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1946, Teller left Los Alamos to return to the University of Chicago as a professor and close associate of Enrico Fermi and <a href="Maria_Goeppert-Mayer" title="wikilink">Maria Mayer</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> He was now known as the father of the hydrogen bomb.</p>

</figure>
<p>Following the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>'s first test detonation of an <a href="atomic_bomb" title="wikilink">atomic bomb</a> in 1949, President <a href="Harry_Truman" title="wikilink">Truman</a> announced a crash development program for a <a href="hydrogen_bomb" title="wikilink">hydrogen bomb</a>. Teller returned to Los Alamos in 1950 to work on the project. He insisted on involving more theorists, such as <a href="Klaus_Fuchs" title="wikilink">Klaus Fuchs</a>; it was Fuchs who later claimed to invent compression by means of radiation implosion back in 1946.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> However many of Teller's prominent colleagues, like Bethe and Oppenheimer, were sure that the project of the H-bomb was technically infeasible and politically undesirable. None of the available designs were yet workable. However Soviet scientists who had worked on their own hydrogen bomb have claimed that they developed it independently.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1950, calculations by the Polish mathematician <a href="Stanislaw_Ulam" title="wikilink">Stanislaw Ulam</a> and his collaborator Cornelius Everett, along with confirmations by Fermi, had shown that not only was Teller's earlier estimate of the quantity of <a href="tritium" class="uri" title="wikilink">tritium</a> needed for the H-bomb a low one, but that even with higher amounts of tritium, the energy loss in the fusion process would be too great to enable the fusion reaction to propagate. However, in 1951, in the joint report by Ulam and Teller of March 1951, &quot;Hydrodynamic Lenses and Radiation Mirrors&quot;, an innovative idea emerged, and it was developed into the first workable design for a megaton-range H-bomb. The exact contribution provided respectively from Ulam and Teller to what became known as the <a href="Teller&lt;U+2013&gt;Ulam_design" title="wikilink">Teller&lt;U+2013&gt;Ulam design</a> is not definitively known in the public domain, and the exact contributions of each and how the final idea was arrived upon has been a point of dispute in both public and classified discussions since the early 1950s.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In an interview with <em><a href="Scientific_American" title="wikilink">Scientific American</a></em> from 1999, Teller told the reporter:</p>
<dl>

<dd><em>&quot;I contributed; Ulam did not. I'm sorry I had to answer it in this abrupt way. Ulam was rightly dissatisfied with an old approach. He came to me with a part of an idea which I already had worked out and had difficulty getting people to listen to. He was willing to sign a paper. When it then came to defending that paper and really putting work into it, he refused. He said, 'I don't believe in it.'</em>&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The issue is controversial. Bethe considered Teller's contribution to the invention of the H-bomb a true innovation as early as 1952,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and referred to his work as a &quot;stroke of genius&quot; in 1954.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In both cases, however, Bethe emphasized Teller's role as a way of stressing that the development of the H-bomb could not have been hastened by additional support or funding, and Teller greatly disagreed with Bethe's assessment. Other scientists (antagonistic to Teller, such as <a href="J._Carson_Mark" title="wikilink">J. Carson Mark</a>) have claimed that Teller would have never gotten any closer without the assistance of Ulam and others.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Ulam himself claimed that Teller only produced a &quot;more generalized&quot; version of Ulam's original design.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>The breakthrough&lt;U+2014&gt;the details of which are still classified&lt;U+2014&gt;was apparently the separation of the fission and fusion components of the weapons, and to use the <a href="radiation" class="uri" title="wikilink">radiation</a> produced by the fission bomb to first compress the fusion fuel before igniting it. Ulam's idea seems to have been to use mechanical shock from the primary to encourage fusion in the secondary, while Teller quickly realized that radiation from the primary would do the job much earlier and more efficiently. Some members of the laboratory (J. Carson Mark in particular) later expressed that the idea to use the radiation would have eventually occurred to anyone working on the physical processes involved, and that the obvious reason why Teller thought of radiation right away was because he was already working on the &quot;<a href="Operation_Greenhouse" title="wikilink">Greenhouse</a>&quot; tests for the spring of 1951, in which the effect of the energy from a fission bomb on a mixture of deuterium and tritium was going to be investigated.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Whatever the actual components of the so-called Teller&lt;U+2013&gt;Ulam design and the respective contributions of those who worked on it, after it was proposed it was immediately seen by the scientists working on the project as the answer which had been so long sought. Those who previously had doubted whether a fission-fusion bomb would be feasible at all were converted into believing that it was only a matter of time before both the USA and the USSR had developed <a href="TNT_equivalent" title="wikilink">multi-megaton</a> weapons. Even Oppenheimer, who was originally opposed to the project, called the idea &quot;technically sweet.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>Though he had helped to come up with the design and had been a long-time proponent of the concept, Teller was not chosen to head the development project (his reputation of a thorny personality likely played a role in this). In 1952 he left Los Alamos and joined the newly established <a href="Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Livermore</a> branch of the <a href="Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">University of California Radiation Laboratory</a>, which had been created largely through his urging. After the detonation of &quot;<a href="Ivy_Mike" title="wikilink">Ivy Mike</a>&quot;, the first thermonuclear weapon to utilize the Teller&lt;U+2013&gt;Ulam configuration, on November 1, 1952, Teller became known in the press as the &quot;father of the hydrogen bomb.&quot; Teller himself refrained from attending the test&lt;U+2014&gt;he claimed not to feel welcome at the <a href="Pacific_Proving_Grounds" title="wikilink">Pacific Proving Grounds</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;and instead saw its results on a <a href="seismograph" class="uri" title="wikilink">seismograph</a> in the basement of a hall in Berkeley.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>There was an opinion that by analyzing the fallout from this test, the Soviets (led in their H-bomb work by <a href="Andrei_Sakharov" title="wikilink">Andrei Sakharov</a>) could have deciphered the new American design. However, this was later denied by the Soviet bomb researchers.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Because of official secrecy, little information about the bomb's development was released by the government, and press reports often attributed the entire weapon's design and development to Teller and his new Livermore Laboratory (when it was actually developed by Los Alamos).<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Many of Teller's colleagues were irritated that he seemed to enjoy taking full credit for something he had only a part in, and in response, with encouragement from Enrico Fermi, Teller authored an article titled &quot;The Work of Many People,&quot; which appeared in <em>Science</em> magazine in February 1955, emphasizing that he was not alone in the weapon's development. He would later write in his memoirs that he had told a &quot;white lie&quot; in the 1955 article in order to &quot;soothe ruffled feelings&quot;, and claimed full credit for the invention.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Teller was known for getting engrossed in projects which were theoretically interesting but practically unfeasible (the classic &quot;Super&quot; was one such project.)<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> About his work on the hydrogen bomb, Bethe said:</p>
<dl>

<dd><em>&quot;Nobody will blame Teller because the calculations of 1946 were wrong, especially because adequate computing machines were not available at Los Alamos. But he was blamed at Los Alamos for leading the laboratory, and indeed the whole country, into an adventurous programme on the basis of calculations, which he himself must have known to have been very incomplete.&quot;</em><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>During the Manhattan Project, Teller also advocated the development of a bomb using <a href="uranium" class="uri" title="wikilink">uranium</a> hydride, which many of his fellow theorists said would be unlikely to work. At Livermore, Teller continued work on the <a href="hydride" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydride</a> bomb, and the result was a dud. Ulam once wrote to a colleague about an idea he had shared with Teller: &quot;Edward is full of enthusiasm about these possibilities; this is perhaps an indication they will not work.&quot; Fermi once said that Teller was the only <a href="monomania" title="wikilink">monomaniac</a> he knew who had several <a href="mania" title="wikilink">manias</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Carey Sublette of Nuclear Weapon Archive argues that Ulam came up with the radiation implosion compression design of thermonuclear weapons, but that on the other hand Teller has gotten little credit for being the first to propose <a href="fusion_boosting" title="wikilink">fusion boosting</a> in 1945, which is essential for miniaturization and reliability and is used in all of today's nuclear weapons.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="oppenheimer-controversy">Oppenheimer controversy</h2>
<figure>
<img src="Edward_Teller_(1958)-LLNL.jpg" title="Teller testified about J. Robert Oppenheimer in 1954." alt="Teller testified about J. Robert Oppenheimer in 1954." /><figcaption>Teller testified about <a href="J._Robert_Oppenheimer" title="wikilink">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a> in 1954.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Teller became controversial in 1954 when he testified against <a href="J._Robert_Oppenheimer" title="wikilink">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>, a former head of Los Alamos and an advisor to the <a href="United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission" title="wikilink">Atomic Energy Commission</a>, at Oppenheimer's <a href="Oppenheimer_security_hearing" title="wikilink">security clearance hearing</a>. Teller had clashed with Oppenheimer many times at Los Alamos over issues relating both to fission and fusion research, and during Oppenheimer's trial he was the only member of the scientific community to label Oppenheimer a security risk.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Asked at the hearing by AEC attorney Roger Robb whether he was planning &quot;to suggest that Dr. Oppenheimer is disloyal to the United States&quot;, Teller replied that:</p>
<dl>

<dd>I do not want to suggest anything of the kind. I know Oppenheimer as an intellectually most alert and a very complicated person, and I think it would be presumptuous and wrong on my part if I would try in any way to analyze his motives. But I have always assumed, and I now assume that he is loyal to the United States. I believe this, and I shall believe it until I see very conclusive proof to the opposite.<ref>
</dd>
</dl>

<p></ref></p>
<p>However, he was immediately asked whether he believed that Oppenheimer was a &quot;security risk&quot;, to which he testified:</p>
<dl>

<dd>In a great number of cases I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act&lt;U+2014&gt;I understood that Dr. Oppenheimer acted&lt;U+2014&gt;in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated. To this extent I feel that I would like to see the vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more. In this very limited sense I would like to express a feeling that I would feel personally more secure if public matters would rest in other hands.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Teller also testified that Oppenheimer's opinion about the thermonuclear program seemed to be based more on the scientific feasibility of the weapon than anything else. He additionally testified that Oppenheimer's direction of Los Alamos was &quot;a very outstanding achievement&quot; both as a scientist and an administrator, lauding his &quot;very quick mind&quot; and that he made &quot;just a most wonderful and excellent director.&quot;</p>
<p>After this, however, he detailed ways in which he felt that Oppenheimer had hindered his efforts towards an active thermonuclear development program, and at length criticized Oppenheimer's decisions not to invest more work onto the question at different points in his career, saying:</p>
<dl>

<dd>If it is a question of wisdom and judgment, as demonstrated by actions since 1945, then I would say one would be wiser not to grant clearance.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Oppenheimer's security clearance was revoked after the hearings. Most of Teller's former colleagues disapproved of his testimony and he became ostracized by much of the scientific community.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> After the fact, Teller consistently denied that he was intending to damn Oppenheimer, and even claimed that he was attempting to exonerate him. Documentary evidence has suggested that this was likely not the case, however. Six days before the testimony, Teller met with an AEC liaison officer and suggested &quot;deepening the charges&quot; in his testimony.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> It has been suggested that Teller's testimony against Oppenheimer was an attempt to remove Oppenheimer from power so that Teller could become the leader of the American nuclear scientist community.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Teller always insisted that his testimony had not significantly harmed Oppenheimer. In 2002, Teller contended that Oppenheimer was &quot;not destroyed&quot; by the security hearing but &quot;no longer asked to assist in policy matters.&quot; He claimed his words were an overreaction, because he had only just learned of Oppenheimer's failure to immediately report an approach by <a href="Haakon_Chevalier" title="wikilink">Haakon Chevalier</a>, who had approached Oppenheimer to help the Russians. Teller said that, in hindsight, he would have responded differently.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Prior to the Oppenheimer controversy, Teller maintained a friendly relationship with Oppenheimer. When Le&lt;U+00F3&gt; Szil&lt;U+00E1&gt;rd asked Teller to help circulate a petition that discourages The United States from using an atomic bomb on Japan unless Japan is made fully aware of the possibility of such an attack, he consulted Oppenheimer&lt;U+2019&gt;s wisdom. Teller believed that Oppenheimer was a natural leader and could help him with such a formidable political problem <a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a>. Oppenheimer reassured Teller that the nation&lt;U+2019&gt;s fate should be left to the sensible politicians in Washington. Bolstered by Oppenheimer&lt;U+2019&gt;s influence, he decided to not sign the petition. However, Teller learned soon after his meeting that Oppenheimer conversely endorsed a political use of the super bomb. Following Teller&lt;U+2019&gt;s discovery, his relationship with his advisor began to deteriorate.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="us-government-work-and-political-advocacy">US Government work and political advocacy</h2>
<p>After the Oppenheimer controversy, Teller became ostracized by much of the scientific community, but was still quite welcome in the government and military science circles. Along with his traditional advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program, he had helped to develop <a href="nuclear_reactor" title="wikilink">nuclear reactor</a> safety standards as the chair of the <a href="Reactor_Safeguard_Committee" title="wikilink">Reactor Safeguard Committee</a> of the AEC in the late 1940s,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> and later headed an effort at <a href="General_Atomics" title="wikilink">General Atomics</a> which designed research reactors in which a <a href="nuclear_meltdown" title="wikilink">nuclear meltdown</a> would be impossible (the <a href="TRIGA" class="uri" title="wikilink">TRIGA</a>).<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Edward_Teller_on_television.jpg" title="fig:Teller on television (1960)." alt="Teller on television (1960)." /> Teller promoted increased defense spending to counter the perceived Soviet missile threat. He was a signatory to the 1958 report by the military sub-panel of the Rockefeller Brothers funded <a href="Special_Studies_Project" title="wikilink">Special Studies Project</a>, which called for a $3 billion annual increase in America's military budget.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>He was Director of the <a href="Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> (1958&lt;U+2013&gt;1960), which he helped to found (along with <a href="Ernest_O._Lawrence" title="wikilink">Ernest O.

He chaired the committee that founded the <a href="Space_Sciences_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Space Sciences Laboratory</a> at Berkeley. He also served concurrently as a Professor of Physics at the <a href="University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="wikilink">University of California, Berkeley</a>. He was a tireless advocate of a strong nuclear program and argued for continued testing and development&lt;U+2014&gt;in fact, he stepped down from the directorship of Livermore so that he could better <a href="Lobbying" title="wikilink">lobby</a> against the proposed <a href="Partial_Test_Ban_Treaty" title="wikilink">test ban</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> He testified against the test ban both before Congress as well as on television.</p>
<p>Teller established the <a href="Department_of_Applied_Science,_UC_Davis" title="wikilink">Department of Applied Science</a> at the <a href="University_of_California,_Davis" title="wikilink">University of California, Davis</a> and <a href="Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">LLNL</a> in 1963, which holds the Edward Teller endowed professorship in his honor.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> In 1975 he retired from both the lab and Berkeley, and was named Director Emeritus of the Livermore Laboratory and appointed Senior Research Fellow at the <a href="Hoover_Institution" title="wikilink">Hoover Institution</a>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> In 1983, he spoke at <em>The Thomas Jefferson School</em>, a conference of intellectuals discussing <a href="Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)" title="wikilink">Objectivism</a> organized by economist Professor <a href="George_Reisman" title="wikilink">George Reisman</a>, where he received a standing ovation.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> After the fall of communism in Hungary in 1989, he made several visits to his country of origin, and paid careful attention to the political changes there.</p>

</figure>
<p>Teller was one of the strongest and best-known advocates for investigating <a href="Peaceful_nuclear_explosions" title="wikilink">non-military uses</a> of nuclear explosives, which the United States explored under <a href="Operation_Plowshare" title="wikilink">Operation Plowshare</a>. One of the most controversial projects he proposed was a plan to use a multi-megaton hydrogen bomb to dig a deep-water harbor more than a mile long and half a mile wide to use for shipment of resources from coal and oil fields through <a href="Point_Hope,_Alaska" title="wikilink">Point Hope</a>, Alaska. The <a href="United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission" title="wikilink">Atomic Energy Commission</a> accepted Teller's proposal in 1958 and it was designated <a href="Operation_Chariot_(1958)" title="wikilink">Project Chariot</a>. While the AEC was scouting out the Alaskan site, and having withdrawn the land from the public domain, Teller publicly advocated the economic benefits of the plan, but was unable to convince local government leaders that the plan was financially viable.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>Other scientists criticized the project as being potentially unsafe for the local wildlife and the <a href="Inupiat_people" title="wikilink">Inupiat</a> people living near the designated area, who were not officially told of the plan until March 1960.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Additionally, it turned out that the harbor would be ice-bound for nine months out of the year. In the end, due to the financial infeasibility of the project and the concerns over radiation-related health issues, the project was cancelled in 1962.</p>
<p>A related experiment which also had Teller's endorsement was a plan to extract oil from the <a href="Athabasca_Oil_Sands" title="wikilink">tar sands</a> in northern <a href="Alberta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alberta</a> with nuclear explosions. The plan actually received the endorsement of the Alberta government, but was rejected by the <a href="Government_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Government of Canada</a> under Prime Minister <a href="John_Diefenbaker" title="wikilink">John Diefenbaker</a>, who was opposed to having any nuclear weapons in Canada, although Canada had nuclear weapons from 1963 to 1984.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="nuclear-technology-and-israel">Nuclear technology and Israel</h2>

<p>For some twenty years, Teller advised Israel on nuclear matters in general, and on the building of a hydrogen bomb in particular.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> In 1952, Teller and Oppenheimer had a long meeting with <a href="David_Ben-Gurion" title="wikilink">David Ben-Gurion</a> in Tel Aviv, telling him that the best way to accumulate plutonium was to burn natural uranium in a nuclear reactor. Starting in 1964, a connection between Teller and Israel was made by the physicist <a href="Yuval_Neeman" title="wikilink">Yuval Neeman</a>, who had similar political views. Between 1964 and 1967, Teller visited Israel six times, lecturing at <a href="Tel_Aviv_University" title="wikilink">Tel Aviv University</a>, and advising the chiefs of Israel's scientific-security circle as well as prime ministers and cabinet members.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>At each of his talks with members of the Israeli security establishment's highest levels he would make them swear that they would never be tempted into signing the <a href="Nuclear_Non-Proliferation_Treaty" title="wikilink">Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> In 1967 when the Israeli nuclear program was nearing completion, Teller informed Neeman that he was going to tell the <a href="CIA" class="uri" title="wikilink">CIA</a> that Israel had built nuclear weapons and explain that it was justified by the background of the <a href="Six-Day_War" title="wikilink">Six-Day War</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> After Neeman cleared it with Prime Minister <a href="Levi_Eshkol" title="wikilink">Levi Eshkol</a>, Teller briefed the head of the CIA's Office of Science and Technology, Carl Duckett.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> It took a year for Teller to convince the CIA that Israel had obtained <a href="nuclear_capability" title="wikilink">nuclear capability</a>; the information then went through CIA Director <a href="Richard_Helms" title="wikilink">Richard Helms</a> and then to the US president at that time, <a href="Lyndon_B._Johnson" title="wikilink">Lyndon B.

<p>In 1980s, Teller again visited Israel to advise the <a href="Israeli_government" title="wikilink">Israeli government</a> on building a nuclear reactor.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Three decades later, Teller confirmed that it was during his visits that he concluded that Israel was in possession of nuclear weapons.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> After conveying the matter to the U.S. government, Teller reportedly said: &quot;They [Israeli] <a href="nuclear_capability" title="wikilink">have it</a>, and they were clever enough to trust their research and not to <a href="nuclear_test" title="wikilink">test</a>, they know that to test would get them into trouble.&quot;<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="three-mile-island">Three Mile Island</h2>

In response, Teller acted quickly to lobby in favor of nuclear energy, testifying to its safety and reliability, and after such a flurry of activity suffered the attack. Teller authored a two-page spread in the <em><a href="Wall_Street_Journal" title="wikilink">Wall Street Journal</a></em> which appeared on July 31, 1979, under the headline &quot;I was the only victim of Three-Mile Island&quot;, which opened with:</p>

</figure>
<p>In the 1980s, Teller began a strong campaign for what was later called the <a href="Strategic_Defense_Initiative" title="wikilink">Strategic Defense Initiative</a> (SDI), derided by critics as &quot;Star Wars,&quot; the concept of using ground and satellite-based lasers, particle beams and missiles to destroy incoming Soviet <a href="ICBM" title="wikilink">ICBMs</a>. Teller lobbied with government agencies&lt;U+2014&gt;and got the approval of President <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Ronald Reagan</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;for a plan to develop a system using elaborate <a href="satellite" title="wikilink">satellites</a> which used atomic weapons to fire <a href="X-ray" class="uri" title="wikilink">X-ray</a> lasers at incoming missiles&lt;U+2014&gt; as part of a broader scientific research program into defenses against nuclear weapons. Scandal erupted when Teller (and his associate <a href="Lowell_Wood" title="wikilink">Lowell Wood</a>) were accused of deliberately overselling the program and perhaps had encouraged the dismissal of a laboratory director (Roy Woodruff) who had attempted to correct the error.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> His claims led to a joke which circulated in the scientific community, that a new unit of unfounded optimism was designated as the teller; one teller was so large that most events had to be measured in nanotellers or picotellers. Many prominent scientists argued that the system was futile. Bethe, along with <a href="IBM" class="uri" title="wikilink">IBM</a> physicist <a href="Richard_Garwin" title="wikilink">Richard Garwin</a> and <a href="Cornell_University" title="wikilink">Cornell University</a> colleague Kurt Gottfried, wrote an article in <em>Scientific American</em> which analyzed the system and concluded that any putative enemy could disable such a system by the use of suitable decoys. The project's funding was eventually scaled back.</p>
<p>Many scientists opposed strategic defense on moral or political rather than purely technical grounds. They argued that, even if an effective system could be produced, it would undermine the system of <a href="Mutually_Assured_Destruction" title="wikilink">Mutually Assured Destruction</a> (MAD) that had prevented all-out war between the western democracies and the communist bloc. An effective defense, they contended, would make such a war &quot;winnable&quot; and therefore more likely.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite (or perhaps because of) his hawkish reputation, Teller made a public point of noting that he regretted the use of the first atomic bombs on civilian cities during World War II. He further claimed that before the bombing of <a href="Hiroshima" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hiroshima</a> he had indeed lobbied Oppenheimer to use the weapons first in a &quot;demonstration&quot; which could be witnessed by the Japanese high-command and citizenry before using them to inflict thousands of deaths. The &quot;father of the hydrogen bomb&quot; would use this quasi-anti-nuclear stance (he would say that he believed nuclear weapons to be unfortunate, but that the <a href="arms_race" title="wikilink">arms race</a> was unavoidable due to the intractable nature of Communism) to promote technologies such as SDI, arguing that they were needed to make sure that nuclear weapons could never be used again (<em>Better a shield than a sword</em> was the title of one of his books on the subject).</p>
<p>There is contrary evidence. In the 1970s, a letter of Teller to <a href="Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;_Szil&lt;U+00E1&gt;rd" title="wikilink">Le&lt;U+00F3&gt; Szil&lt;U+00E1&gt;rd</a> emerged, dated July 2, 1945:</p>

</dl>
<p>The historian <a href="Barton_Bernstein" title="wikilink">Barton Bernstein</a> argued that it is an &quot;unconvincing claim&quot; by Teller that he was a &quot;covert dissenter&quot; to the use of the weapon.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> In his 2001 <em>Memoirs</em>, Teller claims that he did lobby Oppenheimer, but that Oppenheimer had convinced him that he should take no action and that the scientists should leave military questions in the hands of the military; Teller claims he was not aware that Oppenheimer and other scientists were being consulted as to the actual use of the weapon and implies that Oppenheimer was being hypocritical.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>Teller's own comments on the role of lasers in SDI, as disclosed in live panel discussions, were published, and are available, in two laser conference proceedings.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>

<p>Teller's vigorous advocacy for strength through nuclear weapons, especially when so many of his wartime colleagues later expressed regret about the arms race, made him an easy target for the &quot;<a href="mad_scientist" title="wikilink">mad scientist</a>&quot; stereotype. In 1991 he was awarded one of the first <a href="Ig_Nobel_Prize" title="wikilink">Ig Nobel Prizes</a> for Peace in recognition of his &quot;lifelong efforts to change the meaning of peace as we know it&quot;. He was also rumored to be one of the inspirations for the character of <a href="Dr._Strangelove,_or_How_I_Learned_to_Stop_Worrying_and_Love_the_Bomb" title="wikilink">Dr. Strangelove</a> in <a href="Stanley_Kubrick" title="wikilink">Stanley Kubrick</a>'s 1964 <a href="satire" title="wikilink">satirical</a> film of the same name<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> (others speculated to be <a href="RAND_Corporation" title="wikilink">RAND</a> theorist <a href="Herman_Kahn" title="wikilink">Herman Kahn</a>, rocket scientist <a href="Wernher_von_Braun" title="wikilink">Wernher von Braun</a>, and <a href="Secretary_of_Defense" title="wikilink">Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="Robert_McNamara" title="wikilink">Robert McNamara</a>). In the aforementioned <em>Scientific American</em> interview from 1999, he was reported as having bristled at the question: &quot;My name is not Strangelove. I don't know about Strangelove. I'm not interested in Strangelove. What else can I say?... Look.
