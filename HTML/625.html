<p><strong><em>Bound</em></strong> is a 1996 <a href="neo-noir" class="uri" title="wikilink">neo-noir</a> <a href="crime_film" title="wikilink">crime</a> <a href="thriller_film" title="wikilink">thriller film</a> directed by the <a href="Wachowski_Brothers" title="wikilink">Wachowski Brothers</a>. It is about a woman (<a href="Jennifer_Tilly" title="wikilink">Jennifer Tilly</a>) who longs to escape her relationship with her <a href="Mafia" title="wikilink">mafioso</a> boyfriend (<a href="Joe_Pantoliano" title="wikilink">Joe Pantoliano</a>). When she meets the alluring ex-<a href="Convict" title="wikilink">con</a> (<a href="Gina_Gershon" title="wikilink">Gina Gershon</a>) hired to renovate the next-door apartment, the two women begin an affair and hatch a scheme to steal $2 million of Mafia money.</p>
<p><em>Bound</em> was the first film directed by the Wachowskis, and they took inspiration from <a href="Billy_Wilder" title="wikilink">Billy Wilder</a> to tell a noir story filled with sex and violence. Financed by <a href="Dino_De_Laurentiis" title="wikilink">Dino De Laurentiis</a>, the film was made on a tight budget with the help of <a href="frugal" class="uri" title="wikilink">frugal</a> crewmembers including cinematographer <a href="Bill_Pope" title="wikilink">Bill Pope</a>. The directors initially struggled to cast the <a href="lesbian" class="uri" title="wikilink">lesbian</a> characters of Violet and Corky before securing Tilly and Gershon. To choreograph the sex scenes, the directors employed sex educator <a href="Susie_Bright" title="wikilink">Susie Bright</a>, who has a bit part in the film.</p>
<p><em>Bound</em> received positive reviews from film critics who praised the humor and style of the directors as well as the realistic portrayal of a lesbian relationship in a mainstream film. Detractors of the film criticized the excessive violence and superficiality of the plot. It won several festival awards during 1996 and 1997.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>Corky (Gina Gershon), a <a href="lesbian" class="uri" title="wikilink">lesbian</a> ex-con who has just finished a five-year jail <a href="sentence_(law)" title="wikilink">sentence</a>, arrives at an <a href="apartment" class="uri" title="wikilink">apartment</a> building to start work as a painter and plumber. On her way to the apartment, she encounters the couple who live next-door, Violet (Jennifer Tilly) and Caesar (Joe Pantoliano). Violet flirts with Corky and asks her to help retrieve an earring that has fallen down her sink. After Corky extracts the earring, Violet admits she lost it on purpose and starts to <a href="seduction" title="wikilink">seduce</a> her. They are interrupted by the arrival of Caesar. When Corky leaves, Violet follows her home and completes the seduction. The next morning, Violet tells Corky that Caesar is a <a href="Money_laundering" title="wikilink">money launderer</a> for the <a href="Mafia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mafia</a> and they have been together for five years (a sentence similar to Corky's).</p>
<p>Later, Violet overhears Caesar and his Mafia buddies beating and <a href="torture" title="wikilink">torturing</a> Shelly (<a href="Barry_Kivel" title="wikilink">Barry Kivel</a>), a man who has been skimming money from the business. Upset by the violence and cruelty, Violet seeks solace from Corky. She tells Corky that she wants to make a new life for herself, but that she needs her help. Knowing that Caesar will find the nearly $2 million Shelly took and count it in their apartment, she hatches a scheme with Corky to steal the money. Corky, already wary of Violet's intentions and dalliances with men, is unsure whether to trust her.</p>
<p>After Shelly is shot and killed by Johnnie (<a href="Christopher_Meloni" title="wikilink">Christopher Meloni</a>), the son of Mafia boss Gino Marzonne (<a href="Richard_C._Sarafian" title="wikilink">Richard C. Sarafian</a>), Caesar returns to the apartment with a bag of bloody money. Angry at Johnnie for killing Shelly in a fit of rage and splattering blood everywhere, Caesar proceeds to wash, iron and hang the money to dry.</p>
<p><img src="Bound-planning.jpg" title="fig:Corky and Violet plan to steal money from the Mafia." alt="Corky and Violet plan to steal money from the Mafia." width="200" /> Violet explains to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie will be coming to pick up the money from Caesar. The plan is as follows: When Caesar has finished counting the money, Violet will get him a drink to relax him before he showers. Corky will be next-door, waiting until she hears Caesar turn on the shower. When he does, Violet will drop the bottle of <a href="Scotch_whiskey" title="wikilink">Scotch</a> that is for Gino and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, she will let Corky in, who will steal the money from a briefcase and leave. Violet will then return with the Scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leaving, but that Gino was not with him. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to skip town because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not his son.</p>
<p>Everything goes as planned until Caesar finds the money gone. He realizes that if he runs, Gino will think he took the money. He decides he has to get the money back from Johnnie. Panicking, Violet threatens to leave. Caesar pulls out his gun and forces her to stay, thinking that maybe she and Johnnie have stolen the money and framed him.</p>
<p>Corky waits next-door with the money while Gino and Johnnie arrive. After watching Johnnie flirt with Violet and taunt him, Caesar pulls out a gun and tells Gino that his son stole the money. In an angry panic, he kills them both. He tells Violet that they have to find the money, dispose of the bodies, and pretend Gino and Johnnie never arrived, lest their Mafia pals find the money or men missing. Unable to find the money at Johnnie's apartment, Caesar telephones Micky (<a href="John_P._Ryan_(actor)" title="wikilink">John P. Ryan</a>), a Mafia friend, telling him that Gino has yet to arrive.</p>
<p>After discovering Corky and Violet stole the money, Caesar ties them up, gags them, threatens to torture them, and demands to know where it is. When Micky arrives to see what is going on, Caesar tells him Gino was in a car accident and Micky leaves for the hospital. Corky tells Caesar where she has hidden the money. He goes next-door to find it and Violet escapes. She makes a phone call to Micky, telling him that Caesar stole the money and forced her to keep quiet. She then pulls a gun on Caesar, telling him that Micky is on his way and that he should run while he can. Caesar tells Violet that he knows she will not shoot him, to which she replies, &quot;Caesar, you don't know shit&quot;, before killing him.</p>
<p>Later, Micky, who believes Violet's story, tells her that he will find Caesar, and that there is no need to involve the police. Micky wants Violet to be his girlfriend, but she tells him that she needs a clean breakâ€” which she makes by driving off hand-in-hand with Corky.</p>
<h2 id="background-and-production">Background and production</h2>
<h3 id="conception">Conception</h3>
<p>Film producer <a href="Joel_Silver" title="wikilink">Joel Silver</a> has said that after working as scriptwriters on <em><a href="Assassins_(film)" title="wikilink">Assassins</a></em>, the Wachowski Brothers made <em>Bound</em> as an &quot;audition piece&quot; to prove that they knew what to do on a movie set.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> They had the idea to write a story about how one might see a woman on the street and make assumptions about her sexuality, but how those assumptions might be wrong.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> They wanted to play with <a href="stereotype" title="wikilink">stereotypes</a> and make an entertaining film that contained sex and violence, because those are the kinds of films that they like to watch.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Seeing <a href="film_noir" title="wikilink">film noir</a> as a genre within which they could tell a contained story and twist conventions, they described <a href="Billy_Wilder" title="wikilink">Billy Wilder</a> as a big influence.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>When executives at some studios read the script, they told the Wachowskis that if they changed the character of Corky to that of a man, they would be interested. The brothers declined, saying &quot;that movie's been made a million times, so we're really not interested in it.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <a href="Dino_De_Laurentiis" title="wikilink">Dino De Laurentiis</a>, the <a href="executive_producer" title="wikilink">executive producer</a> on <em>Assassins</em>, offered to finance <em>Bound</em> and his company produced it, giving them &quot;free rein&quot; over the story.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The film's budget was $6,000,000.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="casting">Casting</h3>
<p>The Wachowski brothers struggled to cast the roles of Violet and Corky, seemingly because of the lesbian content of the film. Few actresses were interested.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The part of Violet was expected to go to <a href="Linda_Hamilton" title="wikilink">Linda Hamilton</a>, and Jennifer Tilly read for the part of Corky. She loved the role and was looking forward to playing a character very different from previous parts in her career.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> When the part of Violet became available, and Gina Gershon came in to read for Corky, Tilly agreed that Gershon would make a better Corky.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> She realized that she identified with the character of Violet, a woman &quot;underestimated by all the men around her&quot; who has to &quot;play the game&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> She describes it as the best role she had ever had.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Gina Gershon suggested Joe Pantoliano to the Wachowski Brothers for the part of Caesar. His first lead role in a film, he describes it as his favorite.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="filming">Filming</h3>
<p><em>Bound</em> was shot in thirty-eight days in <a href="Santa_Monica,_California" title="wikilink">Santa Monica, California</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The Wachowski's original <a href="director_of_photography" title="wikilink">director of photography</a> resigned on the grounds that he could not do the film with the limited budget he had available, nor did he know anyone he believed could. The brothers subsequently hired cinematographer <a href="Bill_Pope" title="wikilink">Bill Pope</a>, who knew &quot; a bunch of cheap guys&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Pope became heavily involved in creating the visual noir style of the film. He and the Wachowskis drew from their love of comics and were influenced by <a href="Frank_Miller_(comics)" title="wikilink">Frank Miller</a>'s neo-noir <em><a href="Sin_City" title="wikilink">Sin City</a></em> series in particular.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Pope's sound counterpart was sound director <a href="Dane_Davis" title="wikilink">Dane Davis</a>. One of his ideas was to give Corky a <a href="cat" class="uri" title="wikilink">cat</a>-like quality by making a &quot;swishing&quot; sound every time she walks past the camera in the scene where she and Violet plan the theft.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The Wachowskis asked Joe Pantoliano to watch <a href="John_Huston" title="wikilink">John Huston</a>'s <em><a href="The_Treasure_of_the_Sierra_Madre_(film)" title="wikilink">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</a></em> and to focus on <a href="Humphrey_Bogart" title="wikilink">Humphrey Bogart</a>'s character in order to prepare the <a href="paranoia" class="uri" title="wikilink">paranoia</a> of Caesar.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Gershon's influences for her role were <a href="James_Dean" title="wikilink">James Dean</a>, <a href="Marlon_Brando" title="wikilink">Marlon Brando</a> and <a href="Clint_Eastwood" title="wikilink">Clint Eastwood</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Both Gershon and Tilly were nervous about filming the sex scenes and prepared by drinking <a href="tequila" class="uri" title="wikilink">tequila</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Very little <a href="improvisation" class="uri" title="wikilink">improvisation</a> took place during the filming due to the directors' extensive planning and clear vision for the film.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Not everything went as expected, however, as the physical exchanges in the script caused some injuries. Barry Kivel, whose character Shelly was violently beaten in Caesar's bathroom, received a head injury from his head being banged against the toilet. In the scenes between Corky and Caesar near the end of the film, Gina Gershon hit her hand so hard when she knocked a gun from Joe Pantoliano's hand that she required <a href="surgical_suture" title="wikilink">stitches</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sex-scenes">Sex scenes</h3>
<p>The sex scenes were choreographed by <a href="feminism" title="wikilink">feminist</a> writer and <a href="sex_education" title="wikilink">sex educator</a> <a href="Susie_Bright" title="wikilink">Susie Bright</a>. The Wachowski brothers were fans of Bright and sent her a copy of the script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly what was happening in the sex scenes, she asked if she could be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowski Brothers believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Bright appeared as Jesse, the woman Corky tries to talk to in the bar. Comedienne <a href="Margaret_Smith_(comedian)" title="wikilink">Margaret Smith</a> played Jessie's girlfriend and the extras in the bar scene were Bright's friends &lt;U+2014&gt; &quot;real life <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a> <a href="dyke_(lesbian)" title="wikilink">dykes</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
<p>The Wachowski brothers describe several themes present in <em>Bound</em>. They say that the film is about &quot;the boxes people make of their lives&quot;, that it is not only gay people who &quot;live in <a href="The_closet" title="wikilink">closets</a>&quot;. They wanted to define all of <em>Bound</em>'s characters by the &quot;sort of trap that they were making out of their lives&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Violet is trapped in her life with Caesar, and in the first scene, Corky is literally inside Violet's closet, bound and gagged by Caesar.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> This scene is echoed later in the film when Violet says &quot;I had this image of you inside of me...&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> This theme of being trapped is exacerbated by the claustrophobic feeling created by the fact that most of the film takes place in Corky's apartment, Violet and Casear's apartment, or the apartment next door where Corky is working.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Susie Bright described some of the specifically lesbian themes of the film. One is the concept of the hand as a <a href="sex_organ" title="wikilink">sex organ</a>, highlighted by lingering camera shots of Corky and Violet's hands.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Another is the repeated use of water as a symbolic <a href="Motif_(visual_arts)" title="wikilink">motif</a> to represent women, present for example when Corky is retrieving Violet's earring from the sink.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Bright describes it as a movie that is &quot;wet&quot; (feminine) as opposed to &quot;hard&quot; (masculine).<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> She says the scene where Corky and Violet have their first conversation is full of &quot;lesbian signs&quot;. She highlights the fact that Violet, away from Caesar, is wearing jeans and able to be less overtly feminine. Jennifer Tilly says that whenever Violet is talking to men, her voice becomes high-pitched and &quot;girly&quot; &lt;U+2014&gt; making her seem vulnerable and ensuring she is taken care of. Joe Pantoliano agrees, saying that the result is that &quot;everyone in the film wants to be with Violet&quot;.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> When she is with Corky, Violet can drop the act and talk at a more natural pitch. According to Bright, the more subtle lesbian themes of the film were noticed and appreciated at the <a href="LGBT" class="uri" title="wikilink">LGBT</a> film festival screenings.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
