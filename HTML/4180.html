<p>The <strong>Shunzhi Emperor</strong> (<a href="Wade-Giles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wade-Giles</a>: <strong>Shun-chih Emperor</strong>; ; <a href="Manchu_language" title="wikilink">Manchu</a>: <img src="Shunzhi1.PNG" title="fig:Shunzhi1.PNG" alt="Shunzhi1.PNG" width="40" /> <em>ijish&lt;U+016B&gt;n dasan h&lt;U+016B&gt;wangdi</em>; <a href="Mongolian_language" title="wikilink">Mongolian</a>: Eyebeer Zasagch Khaan; 15 March 1638Â &lt;U+2013&gt; 5 February 1661), was the third <a href="Emperor_of_China" title="wikilink">emperor</a> of the <a href="Qing_dynasty" title="wikilink">Qing dynasty</a> and the first Qing (pronounced &quot;Ch'ing&quot;) emperor to rule over <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>, which he did from 1644 to 1661. A <a href="Deliberative_Council_of_Princes_and_Ministers" title="wikilink">committee of Manchu princes</a> chose him to succeed his father <a href="Hong_Taiji" title="wikilink">Hong Taiji</a> (1592&lt;U+2013&gt;1643) in September 1643 when he was five years old. The <a href="Qing_Dynasty_nobility" title="wikilink">princes</a> also appointed two co-regents: <a href="Dorgon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dorgon</a> (1612&lt;U+2013&gt;1650), fourteenth son of Qing founder <a href="Nurhaci" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nurhaci</a> (1559&lt;U+2013&gt;1626), and <a href="Jirgalang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jirgalang</a> (1599&lt;U+2013&gt;1655), one of Nurhaci's nephews, both of whom were members of <a href="Aisin_Gioro" title="wikilink">the Qing imperial clan</a>.</p>
<p>From 1643 to 1650, political power lay mostly in the hands of Dorgon. Under his leadership, the Qing conquered most of the territory of the fallen <a href="Ming_dynasty" title="wikilink">Ming dynasty</a> (1368&lt;U+2013&gt;1644), chased <a href="Southern_Ming_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Ming loyalist regimes</a> deep into the southwestern provinces, and established the basis of Qing rule over China despite highly unpopular policies like the &quot;haircutting command&quot; of 1645, which forced Qing subjects to shave their forehead and braid their remaining hair into a <a href="queue_(hairstyle)" title="wikilink">queue</a> like the <a href="Manchu_people" title="wikilink">Manchus</a>. After Dorgon's death on the last day of 1650, the young monarch started to rule personally. He tried, with mixed success, to fight corruption and to reduce the political influence of the Manchu nobility. In the 1650s he faced a resurgence of Ming loyalist resistance, but by 1661 his armies had defeated the Qing's last enemies, seafarer <a href="Koxinga" class="uri" title="wikilink">Koxinga</a> (1624&lt;U+2013&gt;1662) and the <a href="Prince_of_Gui" title="wikilink">Prince of Gui</a> (1623&lt;U+2013&gt;1662) of the <a href="Southern_Ming" title="wikilink">Southern Ming</a>, both of whom would succomb the following year. The Shunzhi emperor died at the age of 22 of <a href="smallpox" class="uri" title="wikilink">smallpox</a>, a highly <a href="Infectious_disease" title="wikilink">contagious disease</a> that was <a href="Endemic_(epidemiology)" title="wikilink">endemic</a> in China, but against which the Manchus had no <a href="Immunity_(medical)" title="wikilink">immunity</a>. He was succeeded by his third son <a href="Xuanye" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xuanye</a>, who had already survived smallpox, and who subsequently reigned for sixty years under the name of <a href="Kangxi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kangxi</a>. Because fewer documents have survived from the Shunzhi era than from later Qing reigns, the Shunzhi age is a relatively little-known period of Qing history.</p>
<p>&quot;Shunzhi&quot; was the name of this ruler's <a href="Chinese_era_name" title="wikilink">reign period</a> in Chinese. This title had equivalents in Manchu and Mongolian because the Qing imperial family was Manchu, and ruled over many <a href="Mongol_people" title="wikilink">Mongol tribes</a> that helped the Qing to <a href="Manchu_conquest_of_China" title="wikilink">conquer China</a>. The emperor's personal name was <strong>Fulin</strong>, and the <a href="temple_name" title="wikilink">posthumous name</a> by which he was worshipped at the <a href="Imperial_Ancestral_Temple" title="wikilink">Imperial Ancestral Temple</a> was <strong>Shizu</strong> (Wade-Giles: <strong>Shih-tsu</strong>; Chinese: &lt;U+4E16&gt;&lt;U+7956&gt;).</p>
