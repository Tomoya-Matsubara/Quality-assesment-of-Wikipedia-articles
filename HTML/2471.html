<p>Rule of three}}</p>
<p>In <a href="statistical_analysis" title="wikilink">statistical analysis</a>, the <strong>rule of three</strong> states that if a certain event did not occur in a sample with <em>n</em> <a href="Design_of_experiments" title="wikilink">subjects</a>, 0 to 3/<em>n</em> is a 95% <a href="confidence_interval" title="wikilink">confidence interval</a> for the rate of occurrences in the <a href="population_(statistics)" title="wikilink">population</a>. When <em>n</em> is greater than 30, this is a good approximation to results from more sensitive tests.<ref>There are other meanings of the term &quot;rule of three&quot; in mathematics, and a further distinct meaning within statistics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A century and a half ago Charles Darwin said he had &quot;no Faith in anything short of actual measurement and the Rule of Three,&quot; by which he appeared to mean the peak of arithmetical accomplishment in a nineteenth-century gentleman, solving for <em>x</em> in &quot;6 is to 3 as 9 is to <em>x</em>.&quot; Some decades later, in the early 1900s, Karl Pearson shifted the meaning of the rule of three &lt;U+2013&gt; &quot;take 3&lt;U+03C3&gt; [<a href="three-sigma_rule" title="wikilink">three standard deviations</a>] as definitely significant&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; and claimed it for his new journal of significance testing, <em>Biometrika</em>. Even Darwin late in life seems to have fallen into the confusion. (Ziliak and McCloskey, 2008, p. 26; parenthetic gloss in original)</p>

<p>For example, a pain-relief drug is tested on 1500 human subjects, and no <a href="adverse_event" title="wikilink">adverse event</a> is recorded. From the rule of three, it can be concluded with 95% confidence that fewer than 1 person in 500 (or 3/1500) will experience an adverse event.</p>
<p>The rule is useful in the interpretation of <a href="clinical_trial" title="wikilink">clinical trials</a> generally, particularly in <a href="Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_II" title="wikilink">phase II</a> and phase III where often there are limitations in duration or <a href="statistical_power" title="wikilink">statistical power</a>. The rule of three applies well beyond medical research, to any trial done <em>n</em> times. If 300 parachutes are randomly tested and all open successfully, then it is concluded with 95% confidence that fewer than 1 in 100 parachutes with the same characteristics (3/300) will fail.</p>

<p>A 95% <a href="confidence_interval" title="wikilink">confidence interval</a> is sought for the probability <em>p</em> of an event occurring for any randomly selected single individual in a population, given that it has not been observed to occur in <em>n</em> <a href="Bernoulli_trial" title="wikilink">Bernoulli trials</a>. Denoting the number of events by <em>X</em>, we therefore wish to find the values of the parameter <em>p</em> of a <a href="binomial_distribution" title="wikilink">binomial distribution</a> that give Pr(<em>X</em> = 0) &lt;U+2265&gt; 0.05. The rule can then be derived<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> either from the <a href="binomial_distribution#Poisson_approximation" title="wikilink">Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution</a>, or from the formula (1&lt;U+2212&gt;<em>p</em>)<sup><em>n</em></sup> for the probability of zero events in the binomial distribution by taking logarithms and keeping only the first term of a <a href="Taylor_series#List_of_Maclaurin_series_of_some_common_functions" title="wikilink">series expansion of the natural logarithm</a>. In either case, the factor of three arises from &lt;U+2212&gt;<a href="natural_logarithm" title="wikilink">ln</a>(0.05) = ln(20) = 2.9957 &lt;U+2248&gt; 3.</p>
