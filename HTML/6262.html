<p>The <strong>American White Ibis</strong> (<em>Eudocimus albus</em>) is a species of <a href="bird" class="uri" title="wikilink">bird</a> in the <a href="ibis" class="uri" title="wikilink">ibis</a> family <a href="Threskiornithidae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Threskiornithidae</a>. It is found from the <a href="Mid-Atlantic_states" title="wikilink">mid-Atlantic</a> and <a href="Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Gulf Coast</a> of the United States south through most of the New World tropics.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> This ibis is a medium-sized bird with an overall white <a href="plumage" class="uri" title="wikilink">plumage</a>, bright red-orange down-curved bill and long legs, and black wing tips that are usually only visible in flight. Males are larger and have longer bills than females. The <a href="breeding_season" title="wikilink">breeding</a> range runs along the Gulf and <a href="East_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Atlantic Coast</a>, and the coasts of Mexico and Central America. Outside the breeding period, the range extends further inland in North America and also includes the <a href="Caribbean" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caribbean</a>. It is also found along the northwestern South American coastline in Colombia and Venezuela. Populations in central Venezuela overlap and interbreed with the <a href="Scarlet_Ibis" title="wikilink">Scarlet Ibis</a>. The two have been classified by some authorities as a single species.</p>
<p>The diet consists primarily of small aquatic prey such as insects and small fishes. <a href="Crayfish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crayfish</a> are its preferred food in most regions; however, it can adjust its diet according to the habitat and prey abundance. It is a tactile non-visual forager, whose main <a href="foraging" class="uri" title="wikilink">foraging</a> behavior is probing with its beak at the bottom of shallow water to feel for and to capture its prey.</p>
<p>During the breeding season, the American White Ibis gathers in huge <a href="Bird_colony" title="wikilink">colonies</a> near water. Pairs are predominantly <a href="monogamous" class="uri" title="wikilink">monogamous</a> and both parents care for the young, although males tend to engage in <a href="promiscuity#Extra-pair_copulation_in_animals" title="wikilink">extra-pair copulation</a> with other females to increase their <a href="reproductive_success" title="wikilink">reproductive success</a>. Males have also been found to <a href="Kleptoparasitism" title="wikilink">pirate</a> food from unmated females and juveniles during the breeding season.</p>
<p>Human pollution has affected the behavior of the American White Ibis via an increase in the concentrations of <a href="methylmercury" class="uri" title="wikilink">methylmercury</a>, which is released into the environment from untreated waste. Exposure to methylmercury alters the hormone levels of American White Ibis, affecting their mating and <a href="Nesting_instinct" title="wikilink">nesting</a> behavior and leading to lower reproduction rates.</p>
<h2 id="taxonomy">Taxonomy</h2>
<p>The American White Ibis was one of the many <a href="Aves_in_the_10th_edition_of_Systema_Naturae" title="wikilink">bird species originally described</a> by <a href="Carl_Linnaeus" title="wikilink">Carl Linnaeus</a> in the 1758 <a href="10th_edition_of_Systema_Naturae" title="wikilink">10th edition</a> of his <em><a href="Systema_Naturae" title="wikilink">Systema Naturae</a></em>, where it was given the <a href="Binomial_nomenclature" title="wikilink">binomial name</a> of <em>Scolopax albus</em>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The <a href="specific_name_(zoology)" title="wikilink">species name</a> is the <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> adjective  &quot;white&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Alternative common names that have been used include Spanish Curlew and White Curlew.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> English naturalist <a href="Mark_Catesby" title="wikilink">Mark Catesby</a> mistook immature birds for a separate species, which he called the Brown Curlew.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Local <a href="Louisiana_Creole_French" title="wikilink">creole</a> names in <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a> include <em>bec croche</em> and <em>petit flaman</em>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Johann_Georg_Wagler" title="wikilink">Johann Georg Wagler</a> gave the species its current binomial name in 1832 when he erected the new genus <em><a href="Eudocimus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eudocimus</a></em>, whose only other species is the <a href="Scarlet_Ibis" title="wikilink">Scarlet Ibis</a> (<em>E. ruber</em>). There has long been debate on whether the two should be considered <a href="subspecies" class="uri" title="wikilink">subspecies</a> or closely related species,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and the <a href="American_Ornithologists&#39;_Union" title="wikilink">American Ornithologists' Union</a> considers the two to be a <a href="superspecies" class="uri" title="wikilink">superspecies</a> as they are <a href="Parapatric_speciation" title="wikilink">parapatric</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The lack of observed <a href="Hybrid_(biology)" title="wikilink">hybrids</a> was a large factor in the view that the species were separate.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>However, in a field study published in 1987, researchers Cristina Ramo and Benjamin Busto found evidence of interbreeding in a population where the ranges of the Scarlet and White Ibises overlap along the coast and in the <a href="Los_Llanos,_Venezuela" title="wikilink">Llanos region</a> of Colombia and Venezuela. They observed individuals of the two species mating and pairing, as well as hybrid ibises with pale orange plumage, or white plumage with occasional orange feathers, and have proposed that these birds be classified as a single species,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> which has been followed by least one <a href="field_guide" title="wikilink">field guide</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Hybrid ibises have also been recorded in Florida, where the Scarlet Ibis has been <a href="Introduced_species" title="wikilink">introduced</a> into wild populations of American White Ibis. Birds of intermediate to red plumage have persisted for generations.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Ornithologists James Hancock and Jim Kushlan also consider the two to be a single species, with the differences in plumage, size, skin coloration and degree of bill darkening during breeding season forming the diagnostic characters. They have proposed the populations recontacted in northwestern South America after a period of separation, and that the color difference is likely due to the presence of an <a href="enzyme" class="uri" title="wikilink">enzyme</a> that allows uptake of <a href="pigment" class="uri" title="wikilink">pigment</a> in the diet. They have raised the question whether white-plumaged birds of South America are in fact part of the <em>ruber</em> rather than the <em>albus</em> <a href="taxon" class="uri" title="wikilink">taxon</a>, and acknowledge that more investigation is needed to determine this.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

It then fades to a paler pink, and the tip of the bill becomes blackish.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> It is difficult to determine the sex of an adult American White Ibis from its external appearance, since the sexes have similar plumage.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> However, there is <a href="sexual_dimorphism" title="wikilink">sexual dimorphism</a> in size and proportion as males are significantly larger and heavier than females and have longer and stouter bills.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> A study of the American White Ibis in southern Florida yielded weight ranges of  for males and  for females, with average weights of  for males and  for females.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The length of adult female and male birds ranges from  with a  wingspan.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The newly hatched American White Ibis is covered with gray <a href="down_feather" title="wikilink">down feathers</a>, deepening to dark brown or black on the head and wings. The chest is often bare and there can be a white tuft on the head. The <a href="Iris_(anatomy)" title="wikilink">irises</a> are brown. The exposed skin is pinkish initially, apart from the tip of the bill which is dark gray, but turns gray within a few days of hatching.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The bill is short and straight at birth and has an <a href="egg_tooth" title="wikilink">egg tooth</a> which falls off between days five and nine,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and develops three black rings from around day six, before turning gray by around six weeks of age. The gray to sandy gray brown juvenile plumage appears between weeks two and six, and face and bill become pink a few weeks later, while the legs remain gray. The irises have turned slate-gray by this stage.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Once <a href="fledge" title="wikilink">fledged</a>, the juvenile American White Ibis has largely brown plumage and only the rump, underwing and underparts are white.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The legs become light orange. As it matures, white feathers begin appearing on the back and it undergoes a gradual <a href="Moulting#Birds" title="wikilink">molt</a> to obtain the white adult plumage.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> This is mostly complete by the end of the second year, although some brown feathers persist on the head and neck until the end of the third year. Juvenile birds take around two years to reach adult size and weight.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Like other species of ibis, the American White Ibis flies with neck and legs outstretched, often in long loose lines or 'V' formations&lt;U+2014&gt;a 1986 field study in North Carolina noted over 80% of adult ibis doing so, while juveniles rapidly took up the practice over the course of the summer. The resulting improvement in <a href="aerodynamics" class="uri" title="wikilink">aerodynamics</a> may lower energy expenditure.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> These lines fly in an undulating pattern as they alternately flap and glide. Soaring in a circular pattern is also seen.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Heights of  may be reached as birds glide over flights of  or more. More commonly, birds fly between 60 and 100 m (200&lt;U+2013&gt;350 ft) above the ground, gliding or flapping at a rate of around 3.3 wingbeats a second.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>The main <a href="bird_vocalization" title="wikilink">call</a> of the American White Ibis is a honking sound, transcribed as <em>urnk, urnk</em>,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> or <em>hunk, hunk</em>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The call is used in flight, courtship or when disturbed. Birds also utter a muted <em>huu-huu-huu</em> call while foraging, and make a squealing call in courtship. Young in the nest give a high-pitched <em>zziu</em> as a begging call.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="similar-species">Similar species</h3>
<p>Immature American White and Scarlet Ibises are very difficult to tell apart, although Scarlet Ibises tend to have darker legs and bare skin around the face.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> An immature American White Ibis could be mistaken for an immature <a href="Glossy_Ibis" title="wikilink">Glossy Ibis</a>, but the latter is wholly dark brown and lacks the white belly and rump.

It also occurs throughout the Caribbean, on both coasts of Mexico (from <a href="Baja_California" title="wikilink">Baja California</a> southwards) and Central America, and as far south as Columbia and Venezuela. The non-breeding range extends further inland, reaching north to <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a>, and west to eastern <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a>.

<h2 id="behavior">Behavior</h2>
<p><img src="White_Ibis_in_Florida.jpg" title="fig:American White Ibis in a neighborhood pond in Tampa Bay,Florida " alt="American White Ibis in a neighborhood pond in Tampa Bay,Florida " />. A field study late in the Florida nesting season revealed that on an average day, adult American White Ibis spent 10.25 hours looking for food, 0.75 hours flying, 13 hours resting, roosting, and attending to their nests.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Much of the time roosting is spent <a href="Personal_grooming#In_animals" title="wikilink">preening</a>, biting and working their feathers with their long bills, as well as rubbing the <a href="uropygial_gland" title="wikilink">oil glands</a> on the sides of their heads on back plumage. American White Ibis generally only preen themselves, not engaging in <a href="Social_grooming" title="wikilink">allopreening</a> unless part of courtship behavior. Bathing often takes place before preening; ibis squat in water 5&lt;U+2013&gt;20 cm (2&lt;U+2013&gt;8 in) deep and flick water over themselves with each wing in succession. Hundreds of birds may bathe together around the time of courtship.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>The American White Ibis is <a href="Territory_(animal)" title="wikilink">territorial</a>, defending the nesting and display sites against intruders. <a href="Agonistic_behaviour" title="wikilink">Agonistic</a> or threat displays include lunging forward with the bill in a horizontal posture, and standing upright and snapping the bill opposite another bird engaging in the same display.

<p><img src="Ibis_Tree.jpg" title="fig:Birds roosting in a tree near to St. Johns River, Florida" alt="Birds roosting in a tree near to St. Johns River, Florida" /> The American White Ibis pairs up in spring and breeds in huge <a href="Bird_colony" title="wikilink">colonies</a>, often with other waterbird species. Nesting begins as soon as suitable foraging and nesting habitat is available. The female selects the site, usually in the branches of a tree or shrub, which is often over water, and builds the nest, and males assist by bringing nest material.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Anywhere from one to five <a href="bird_egg" title="wikilink">eggs</a> are typically laid, with two or three being the most common. The eggs are matt pale blue-green in color with brown splotches and measure 5.8 x 3.9 cm (2.3 x 1.5 in) and weigh on average 50.8 g (1.8 oz).<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> <a href="Clutch_(eggs)" title="wikilink">Clutch</a> sizes are usually lower in coastal colonies as compared to inland colonies, although there are no statistically significant differences in the fledging rate of both colonies.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Throughout the mating and <a href="Avian_incubation" title="wikilink">incubation</a> period, the male undergoes a period of <a href="starvation" class="uri" title="wikilink">starvation</a> to stay close to the nest and aggressively defend his nest and mate from both predators and other ibises in preference to foraging for food.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> In the 2006 breeding season, a non-breeding adult female was observed to be tending to multiple nests that belonged to other American White Ibises&lt;U+2014&gt;the first time the behavior has been documented for this species.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the American White Ibis is predominantly <a href="monogamous" class="uri" title="wikilink">monogamous</a> and both sexes provide parental care to their young, the male often flies off to engage in <a href="extra_pair_copulation" title="wikilink">extra pair copulation</a> with other nesting females after mating with its primary female partner. These extra-pair copulations are usually done after the within-pair copulations,<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> and make up about 45% of all total matings, although only about 15% of all extra-pair copulations are successful.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> By not restricting the number of females it copulates with, the male is able to increase its reproductive success considerably.

<p><img src="Juvenile_American_White_Ibis.jpg" title="fig:Juvenile in Everglades National Park. Some of its brown feathers have molted and have been replaced with white feathers." alt="Juvenile in Everglades National Park. Some of its brown feathers have molted and have been replaced with white feathers." /> The breeding success of the American White Ibis is sensitive to the <a href="hydrology" title="wikilink">hydrological</a> conditions of the <a href="ecosystem" class="uri" title="wikilink">ecosystem</a> such as rainfall and water levels. Low and decreasing water levels predict good prey accessibility. Water level reversals, where levels rise in the breeding season, disperse prey and impact on foraging success. Nest numbers and average clutch sizes are smaller in periods of reduced prey availability.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The success rate of parents raising one or more young to 20 days of age ranges widely from 5 to 70% of nests, and varies greatly between nearby colonies.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> American White Ibis parents have been known to supplement their chicks' diet with items such as cockroaches and rotting food from human garbage in poorer years, when fish and crayfish are more scarce.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Studies have also shown that years with higher nesting numbers had significantly faster spring drying rates of water bodies than years with low nesting numbers. This is because faster drying rates means that there are fewer fish and increased available area where crayfish can be hunted.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> This highlights the fact that American White Ibises do not use probability of nesting failure as a key factor in determining nesting sites but instead, rely on other criteria such as prey availability and nest-site <a href="predation" class="uri" title="wikilink">predation</a> rates.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> The draining of wetlands in south Florida has also impacted on species that forage in shallow water such as the American White Ibis, and its increase in numbers is a key indicator of restoration of habitat within the Everglades.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>The main cause of nest failure among the species is due to nest abandonment,<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> the leading cause of which is inundation from extremely high tides. Parents abandoned 61% of all nesting starts either during or immediately after extremely high tides. The eggs float out of the flooded nests, or get washed out into the sea by wave action. Incubating parents usually abandon the nest when the water or tidal levels reaches 3 to 8 cm (1 to 4 in) above the bottom of the nest cup. Nevertheless, there have been instances where the parents have been observed to transport their eggs to another nest in an attempt to salvage some of the eggs. However, despite the fact that some nesting sites face high chance of tidal damage every breeding season, American White Ibises still continue to nest in these areas because of other favorable conditions such as abundant nearby food sources and low egg predation rates.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Eudocimus_albus_-Winter_Haven,_Florida,_USA_-juvenile-8_(2).jpg" title="fig:Juvenile in Florida" alt="Juvenile in Florida" /> The eggs hatch after about three weeks and the young are attended by both parents. Males are present around the nest for most of the day, and females most of the night. The parents exchange nest duties in the morning and in the evening. Most of the feeding of the chicks occurs during the period where they swap nesting duties. Little feeding is done in the period of the day that is between the two duty swaps and no feeding is done between midnight and 6 a.m.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Chick mortality is highest in the first twenty days post hatching, with anywhere from 37 to 83% of hatchlings surviving to three weeks of age in the Everglades.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> During periods of food limitations and starvation events, the American White Ibis tends to exhibit sex-dependent pre-fledgling mortality.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> For many bird species that have sexually dimorphic nestlings, mortality rates are higher for larger-sized male nestlings as a result of the parents&lt;U+2019&gt; inability to meet its greater nutritional needs.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> However, in the case of the American White Ibis, the male nestlings actually have a lower mortality rate as compared to the females despite being on average 15% greater in mass as compared to its female counterparts.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Although current research has yet to discover the underlying factors to why the males tend to have better survival rates under such conditions, it is suspected that the parents tend to feed the larger male nestlings first because they are either perceived by the parents to have a higher chance of survival, or, being generally larger in size, the larger male nestlings simply out-compete the small females for food.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>
<p><img src="Eudocimus_albus_-USA_-eating_a_fish-8.jpg" title="fig:Adult eating a fish" alt="Adult eating a fish" /> The American White Ibis prefers to eat <a href="crayfish" class="uri" title="wikilink">crayfish</a> and other <a href="crustacean" title="wikilink">crustaceans</a>, but also takes <a href="aquatic_insect" title="wikilink">aquatic insects</a> and small fishes.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Outside the nesting season, the diet is highly variable, as abundance and types of prey depend on the both region and <a href="habitat" class="uri" title="wikilink">habitat</a>. In <a href="Los_Llanos,_Venezuela" title="wikilink">Los Llanos</a>, located on the border of Columbia and Venezuela, the most frequent prey are <a href="insects" class="uri" title="wikilink">insects</a>, such as fly larvae and beetles.

American White Ibises that feed in mangrove swamps focus on crabs.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The tactile nature of the ibis' probing for food in mud means that it catches prey that are too slow to evade the ibis once located by its bill.

It is unclear whether the fish are more easily caught if overcrowded, or whether sheer numbers of fish mean that ibises are catching them instead of crayfish&lt;U+2014&gt;normally, fish are more agile than crayfish and hence elude the ibis' bill more easily. Fish are a more energy-rich source of food for the American White Ibis.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> In the breeding season, American White Ibises in a colony at Pumpkinseed Islandtravelled further to forage in freshwater wetlands and catch crayfish, than nearby saltwater areas where <a href="fiddler_crab" title="wikilink">fiddler crabs</a> predominated, indicating their benefit was worth the extra energy expended in fetching them for their young.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> This travel results in the wholesale transport of nutrients across the landscape by the colony; in a successful breeding year the colony at Pumpkinseed Island was estimated to have contributed a third as much <a href="phosphorus" class="uri" title="wikilink">phosphorus</a> to the neighboring estuary as other environmental processes.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>

However, as the water level recedes in the fall, populations at the coast shift their foraging area inland, to inland marshes and swamplands.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> It has become more common in urban landscapes in Florida since the late 1990s,<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> and is one of a number of wetland-dependent bird species which forages in man-made ponds on golf courses in the southwest of the state.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>The American White Ibis is a <a href="tactile" class="uri" title="wikilink">tactile</a>, nonvisual forager, which limits its ability to choose from a wide variety of prey.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> For the most part, the American White Ibis forages for food by tactile probing. It wades slowly through shallow water and sticks its long, downcurved <a href="beak" title="wikilink">bill</a> into the <a href="Substrate_(marine_biology)" title="wikilink">substrate</a> of the water body with its bill held at around 1 to 2 cm (0.4&lt;U+2013&gt;0.8 in) agape at the tip, and sweeps its long bill back and forth across the bottom to pick out suitable food items.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Birds may also probe when standing still. Groping with a wide open bill is a technique used by ibis in deeper water when alone, as is head swinging, in which the ibis swings its wide open bill widely in open water. Others copy this type of foraging if they see one ibis doing it. On land, the American White Ibis locates prey by sight and pecks, and does not have to insert its bill into the substrate.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> The American White Ibis seeks small prey when other birds are around, as it needs time to break up larger food items into smaller pieces to eat, and other predators such as herons and <a href="egret" title="wikilink">egrets</a> often take the opportunity to rob the ibis of its catch.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a><a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Along with the Scarlet Ibis, the species coexists with another five species of ibis in the Llanos in Venezuela. American White Ibis males are aggressive to and take prey items from smaller ibises, but the smaller females are more often the victims of this behavior.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> <img src="Eudocimus_albus_-Port_Orange,_Florida,_Florida,_USA-8.jpg" title="fig:Adults foraging for food in a front garden in Florida" alt="Adults foraging for food in a front garden in Florida" /> Juveniles have lower foraging efficiency compared to adults and in most feeding flocks, the juveniles are usually outnumbered by the adults. They usually tend to stay close to one another and forage for food together at the peripheral region of the group.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> During the breeding season, adult male ibises have been recorded raiding other parent ibises who are feeding their young in the colony. The raiders force their bill down the throat of the victim&lt;U+2014&gt;either the parent about to disgorge their food or recently fed young&lt;U+2014&gt;and extract the ball of food.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> This behavior allows the otherwise starving adult males to obtain food without having to spend long periods of time away from the nest, and prevent its female mate copulating with another male ibis, which would reduce its own reproductive success. Females and juveniles almost never try to drive off the larger and more aggressive pirating males, but instead try to avoid or move away from them.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> This pirating behavior is less common between two male ibises as the males will actively fight off the pirate.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> The explanation of the species' <a href="sexual_dimorphism" title="wikilink">sexual dimorphism</a> of body size is unclear, because no differences between the sexes in feeding success rates or the foraging behavior have been observed and, as males are larger, they need more food than females.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>
