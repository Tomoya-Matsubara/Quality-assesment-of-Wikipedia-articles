<p><strong>Madonna</strong> (born <strong>Madonna Louise Ciccone</strong>; August 16, 1958) is an American recording artist, actress and entrepreneur. Born in <a href="Bay_City,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Bay City, Michigan</a>, she moved to <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> in 1977 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing in pop groups, she released her debut album in 1983. She followed it with a series of albums in which she found immense popularity by pushing the boundaries of lyrical content in mainstream popular music and imagery in her music videos, which became a fixture on MTV. Throughout her nearly three-decade career, most of her songs have hit number one on the record charts, including &quot;<a href="Like_a_Virgin_(song)" title="wikilink">Like a Virgin</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Like_a_Prayer_(song)" title="wikilink">Like a Prayer</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Vogue_(Madonna_song)" title="wikilink">Vogue</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Music_(Madonna_song)" title="wikilink">Music</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Hung_Up" title="wikilink">Hung Up</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="4_Minutes_(Madonna_song)" title="wikilink">4 Minutes</a>&quot;. Madonna has been praised by critics for her diverse musical productions while at the same time serving as a lightning rod for religious-related controversy.</p>
<p>Her popularity was further enhanced by a film career that began in 1985, but has received mixed commentary. She won critical acclaim and a <a href="Golden_Globe_Award" title="wikilink">Golden Globe Award</a> for <a href="Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actress_&lt;U+2013&gt;_Motion_Picture_Musical_or_Comedy" title="wikilink">Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy</a> for her role in <em><a href="Evita_(film)" title="wikilink">Evita</a></em> (1996), but has received harsh feedback for other film roles. Madonna's other ventures include being a fashion designer, children's book author, film director and producer, and owner of her own recording company <a href="Maverick_(entertainment_company)" title="wikilink">Maverick</a> corporation, as a joint venture with <a href="Time_Warner" title="wikilink">Time Warner</a>. She has received acclaim as a businesswoman and in 2007, she signed an unprecedented US $120 million contract with <a href="Live_Nation" title="wikilink">Live Nation</a>.</p>
<p>Madonna has sold more than 200 million albums worldwide. She is ranked by the <a href="Recording_Industry_Association_of_America" title="wikilink">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) as the best-selling female rock artist of the 20th century, and the second top-selling female artist in the United States behind <a href="Barbra_Streisand" title="wikilink">Barbra Streisand</a>, with 64 million <a href="RIAA_certification" title="wikilink">certified</a> albums. <em><a href="Guinness_World_Records" title="wikilink">Guinness World Records</a></em> listed her as the world's most successful female recording artist of all time. In 2008, <em><a href="Billboard_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Billboard</a></em> magazine ranked Madonna at number two behind only <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a>, on the &quot;<a href="Billboard_Hot_100_50th_Anniversary_Charts#All-Time_top_artists" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists</a>&quot;, making her the most successful solo artist in the history of the chart. She was also inducted into the <a href="Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>.

<p>Madonna Louise Ciccone was born in Bay City, Michigan on August 16, 1958. Her mother, Madonna Louise (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Fortin), was of <a href="French_Canadian" title="wikilink">French Canadian</a> descent, and her father, Silvio Anthony Ciccone, was a first-generation <a href="Italian_American" title="wikilink">Italian American</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Ciccone's family originated from <a href="Pacentro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pacentro</a> in Italy; he later worked as a design engineer for <a href="Chrysler" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chrysler</a> and <a href="General_Motors" title="wikilink">General Motors</a>. Madonna was nicknamed &quot;Little Nonni&quot; to distinguish her from her mother.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The third of six children, her siblings are Martin, Anthony, Paula, <a href="Christopher_Ciccone" title="wikilink">Christopher</a>, and Melanie.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Madonna was raised in the Detroit suburbs of <a href="Pontiac,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Pontiac</a> and Avon Township (now <a href="Rochester_Hills,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Rochester Hills</a>).</p>
<p>Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 30, on December 1, 1963.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Months before her mother's death, Madonna noticed changes in her behaviour and personality from the attentive homemaker she was, although she did not understand the reason.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Mrs. Ciccone, at a loss to explain her dire medical condition, would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna, at which point Madonna would respond by wrapping her arms around her mother tenderly. &quot;I remember feeling stronger than she was,&quot; Madonna recalled, &quot;I was so little and yet I felt like she was the child.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying. &quot;There was so much left unsaid, so many untangled and unresolved emotions, of remorse, guilt, loss, anger, confusion. [...] I saw my mother, looking very beautiful and lying as if she were asleep in an open casket. Then I noticed that my mother's mouth looked funny. It took me some time to realize that it had been sewn up. In that awful moment, I began to understand what I had lost forever. The final image of my mother, at once peaceful yet grotesque, haunts me today also.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Madonna eventually learned to take care of herself and her siblings, and she turned to her grandmother in the hope of finding some solace and some form of her mother in her. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and invariably rebelled against anyone brought into their home ostensibly to take place of their beloved mother.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In an interview with <em>Vanity Fair</em>, Madonna commented that she saw herself in her youth as a &quot;lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades.... I wanted to be somebody.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Terrified that her father could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Her father married the family's housekeeper Joan Gustafson, and they had two children: Jennifer and Mario Ciccone.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> At this point, Madonna began to express unresolved feelings of anger towards her father, that lasted for decades, and developed a rebellious attitude.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Elementary Schools, and then West Middle School. She was known for her high <a href="Grade_(education)" title="wikilink">grade point average</a>, and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, dangle by her knees from the <a href="jungle_gym" title="wikilink">monkey bars</a> during recess, and pull up her skirt during class&lt;U+2014&gt;all so that the boys could see her underwear.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Madonna later attended <a href="Rochester_Adams_High_School" title="wikilink">Rochester Adams High School</a>, and was a straight-A student and a member of the cheerleading squad.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> After graduating, she received a dance scholarship to the <a href="University_of_Michigan" title="wikilink">University of Michigan</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> She convinced her father to allow her to take ballet lessons<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and was persuaded by Christopher Flynn, her ballet teacher, to pursue a career in dance.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> At the end of 1977 she dropped out of college and relocated to New York City.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> She had little money and worked as a waitress at <a href="Dunkin&#39;_Donuts" title="wikilink">Dunkin' Donuts</a> and with <a href="modern_dance" title="wikilink">modern dance</a> troupes.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Madonna said of her move to New York, &quot;It was the first time I'd ever taken a plane, the first time I'd ever gotten a taxi cab. I came here with $35 in my pocket. It was the bravest thing I'd ever done.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> While performing as a dancer for the French disco artist <a href="Patrick_Hernandez" title="wikilink">Patrick Hernandez</a> on his 1979 world tour,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Madonna became romantically involved with musician Dan Gilroy. They formed her first rock band, the <a href="Breakfast_Club_(band)" title="wikilink">Breakfast Club</a>,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> for which Madonna sang and played drums and guitar. In 1980 she left Breakfast Club and, with her former boyfriend <a href="Stephen_Bray" title="wikilink">Stephen Bray</a> as drummer, formed the band Emmy. Their music impressed DJ and record producer <a href="Mark_Kamins" title="wikilink">Mark Kamins</a> who arranged a meeting between Madonna and <a href="Sire_Records" title="wikilink">Sire Records</a> founder <a href="Seymour_Stein" title="wikilink">Seymour Stein</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>Madonna signed a <a href="single_(music)" title="wikilink">singles</a> deal with Sire, a label belonging to <a href="Warner_Bros._Records" title="wikilink">Warner Bros. Records</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Her debut single, &quot;<a href="Everybody_(Madonna_song)" title="wikilink">Everybody</a>&quot;, was released on October 6, 1982, and became a dance hit.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> She started developing her debut album <em><a href="Madonna_(album)" title="wikilink">Madonna</a></em>, which was primarily produced by <a href="Reggie_Lucas" title="wikilink">Reggie Lucas</a>, a Warner Bros. producer. However, she was not happy with the completed tracks and disagreed with Lucas' production techniques, so decided to seek additional help. Madonna moved in with boyfriend <a href="John_Benitez" title="wikilink">John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez</a>, asking his help for finishing the album's production. Benitez remixed most of the tracks and produced &quot;<a href="Holiday_(Madonna_song)" title="wikilink">Holiday</a>&quot;, which was her third single. The overall sound of <em>Madonna</em> is dissonant, and is in the form of upbeat synthetic disco, utilizing some of the new technology of the time, like the usage of <a href="LinnDrum" title="wikilink">Linn drum machine</a>, <a href="Moog_Taurus" title="wikilink">Moog bass</a> and the <a href="synthesizer" title="wikilink">OB-X synthesizer</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The album peaked at number eight on the <a href="Billboard_200" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> 200</a>, and yielded the hit singles &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;<a href="Borderline_(song)" title="wikilink">Borderline</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Lucky_Star_(song)" title="wikilink">Lucky Star</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>Gradually, Madonna's look and manner of dressing, her performances and her music videos started influencing young girls and women. Her style became a female fashion trend of the 1980s. It was created by stylist and jewelry designer <a href="Maripol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maripol</a> and the look consisted of lace tops, skirts over <a href="capri_pants" title="wikilink">capri pants</a>, <a href="fishnet_stockings" title="wikilink">fishnet stockings</a>, jewelry bearing the crucifix, bracelets, and bleached hair.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> She achieved global recognition after the release of her second studio album: <em><a href="Like_a_Virgin" title="wikilink">Like a Virgin</a></em> in 1984. It topped the charts in several countries and became her first number one album on the <em>Billboard</em> 200.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The title track, &quot;<a href="Like_a_Virgin_(song)" title="wikilink">Like a Virgin</a>&quot;, topped the <a href="Billboard_Hot_100" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> Hot 100</a> chart for six consecutive weeks.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> It attracted the attention of family organizations, who complained that the song and its accompanying video promoted premarital sex and undermined family values,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> and moralists sought to have the song and video banned.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Madonna further came under fire when she performed the song at the first <a href="1984_MTV_Video_Music_Awards" title="wikilink">MTV Video Music Awards</a> where she appeared on stage atop a giant wedding cake, wearing a wedding dress and bridal veil, adorned with her characteristic &quot;Boy Toy&quot; belt buckle. The performance is noted by scholars and by MTV as an iconic performance in MTV history.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In later years, Madonna commented that she was actually terrified of the performance. She recalled, &quot;I remember my manager Freddy shouting to me, 'Oh my God! What were you doing? You were wearing a wedding dress. Oh my God! You were rolling around on the floor!' It was the bravest, most blatant sexual thing I had ever done on television.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> <em>Like a Virgin</em> was certified <a href="RIAA_certification" title="wikilink">diamond</a> by the Recording Industry Association of America and sold more than 21 million copies worldwide.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The <a href="National_Association_of_Recording_Merchandisers" title="wikilink">National Association of Recording Merchandisers</a> and <a href="Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> listed the album as one of the &quot;Definitive 200 Albums of All Time&quot; in 1998.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Madonna entered mainstream films in 1985, beginning with a brief appearance as a club singer in <em><a href="Vision_Quest" title="wikilink">Vision Quest</a></em>, a romantic drama film. Its soundtrack contained her U.S. number one single, &quot;<a href="Crazy_for_You_(song)" title="wikilink">Crazy for You</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> She also appeared in the comedy <em><a href="Desperately_Seeking_Susan" title="wikilink">Desperately Seeking Susan</a></em> (1985), a film which introduced the song &quot;<a href="Into_the_Groove" title="wikilink">Into the Groove</a>&quot;, her first number one single in the United Kingdom.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Although not the lead actress for the film, her profile was such that the movie widely became seen (and marketed) as a Madonna vehicle.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The film received a nomination for a <a href="C&lt;U+00E9&gt;sar_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Film" title="wikilink">C&lt;U+00E9&gt;sar Award for Best Foreign Film</a>, and <em>The New York Times</em> film critic <a href="Vincent_Canby" title="wikilink">Vincent Canby</a> named it one of the ten best films of 1985.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> While filming the music video for the second single from <em>Like a Virgin</em>&lt;U+2014&gt;&quot;<a href="Material_Girl" title="wikilink">Material Girl</a>&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;Madonna started dating actor <a href="Sean_Penn" title="wikilink">Sean Penn</a> and married him on her birthday in 1985.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Beginning in April 1985, Madonna embarked on her first concert tour in North America, <a href="The_Virgin_Tour" title="wikilink">The Virgin Tour</a>, with the <a href="Beastie_Boys" title="wikilink">Beastie Boys</a> as her opening act.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Madonna commented: &quot;That whole tour was crazy, because I went from playing <a href="CBGB" class="uri" title="wikilink">CBGB</a> and the <a href="Mudd_Club" title="wikilink">Mudd Club</a> to playing sporting arenas.

<p>Madonna's music has been the subject of much analysis and scrutiny of critics. <a href="Robert_M._Grant" title="wikilink">Robert M. Grant</a>, author of <em>Contemporary Strategy Analysis</em> (2005), commented that what has brought Madonna success is &quot;certainly not outstanding natural talent. As a vocalist, musician, dancer, songwriter, or actress, Madonna's talents seem modest.&quot;<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> He asserts Madonna's success is in relying on the talents of others, and that her personal relationships have served as cornerstones to the numerous reinventions in the longevity of her career.<a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a> Conversely, <em>Rolling Stone</em> has named Madonna &quot;an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics, and a better studio singer than her live spectacles attest.&quot;<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a> <a href="Mark_Bego" title="wikilink">Mark Bego</a>, author of <em>Madonna: Blonde Ambition</em>, called her &quot;the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs&quot;, despite not being a &quot;heavyweight talent.&quot;<a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> Madonna has always been self-conscious about her voice, especially in comparison to her vocal idols such as <a href="Ella_Fitzgerald" title="wikilink">Ella Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="Prince_(musician)" title="wikilink">Prince</a> and <a href="Chaka_Khan" title="wikilink">Chaka Khan</a>.<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing &quot;incredible&quot; hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music. As an example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single &quot;<a href="Into_the_Groove" title="wikilink">Into the Groove</a>&quot; and its line &quot;Live out your fantasy here with me, just let the music set you free; Touch my body, and move in time, now I know you're mine.&quot;<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a> From 1983 to 1986, Madonna's musical productions were often girlish and na&lt;U+00EF&gt;ve in nature, focusing primarily on love, romance, passion and boy-meets-girl relationships.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> This changed with the album <em>Like a Prayer</em>, when the lyrics became much more personal, such as in &quot;Promise to Try&quot;, which references Madonna's lingering pain at the loss of her mother.<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a> Madonna's lyrics often suggest an identification with the gay community. Fouz believes that when Madonna sings &quot;Come on girls, do you believe in love?&quot; in &quot;<a href="Express_Yourself_(Madonna_song)" title="wikilink">Express Yourself</a>&quot;, she is addressing both the gay audience and the heterosexual female.<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> Even in the <em>Erotica</em> era, with its often adult-oriented lyrics, the songs appear free-flowing and gullible (&quot;So won't you go down, where its warm inside&quot; &lt;U+2014&gt; &quot;Where Life Begins&quot; from <em>Erotica</em>). Madonna's songwriting ability has been criticized, with <em>Rolling Stone</em>{{'}}s Maria Raha calling her lyrics &quot;flighty and not spohisticated. Madonna can only bring a trunk full of trite lyrics on the long standing tradition of pop music, love; when she wasn't singing about love, she was singing about partying and dancing.&quot;<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a> Her lyrics were considered banal, and her songwriting capability was largely ignored by critics until the release of <em>Ray of Light</em> and <em>Music</em>. According to Jarman-Ivens, lyrics such as &quot;You're frozen, when your heart's not open&quot; (&quot;<a href="Frozen_(song)" title="wikilink">Frozen</a>&quot;, 1998) and &quot;I can't remember, when I was young, I can't express if it was wrong&quot; (&quot;Paradise Not For Me&quot;, 2000) reflected an artistic palette, &quot;encompassing diverse musical, textual and visual styles in its lyrics.&quot;<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a></p>
<p>On her 1983 debut album, Madonna's vocal abilities and personal artistry were not fully formed. Her vocal style and lyrics was similar to other pop stars of that period like <a href="Paula_Abdul" title="wikilink">Paula Abdul</a>, <a href="Debbie_Gibson" title="wikilink">Debbie Gibson</a> and <a href="Taylor_Dayne" title="wikilink">Taylor Dayne</a>.<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a> The songs on <em>Madonna</em> reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success, including a strong dance-based idiom, catchy <a href="hook_(music)" title="wikilink">hooks</a>, highly polished <a href="music_arranger" title="wikilink">arrangements</a> and Madonna's own vocal style. In songs such as &quot;Lucky Star&quot; and &quot;Borderline&quot;, Madonna introduced a style of upbeat dance music that would prove particularly appealing to gay audiences. The bright, girlish vocal <a href="timbre" class="uri" title="wikilink">timbre</a> of the early years became pass&lt;U+00E9&gt; in Madonna's later works, the change being deliberate, since Madonna was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as &quot;Minnie Mouse on helium&quot;, because of her early voice.<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a> Her second album, <em>Like a Virgin</em> (1984), foreshadowed several trends in Madonna's later works. It contained references to classical works (<a href="pizzicato" class="uri" title="wikilink">pizzicato</a> synthesizer line that opens &quot;<a href="Angel_(Madonna_song)" title="wikilink">Angel</a>&quot;); potential negative reaction from social groups (&quot;<a href="Dress_You_Up" title="wikilink">Dress You Up</a>&quot; was blacklisted by the <a href="Parents_Music_Resource_Center" title="wikilink">Parents Music Resource Center</a>); and retro styles (&quot;Shoo-Bee-Doo&quot;, Madonna's homage to <a href="Motown" class="uri" title="wikilink">Motown</a>).<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a> Madonna's early style, and the change that she ushered in it, is best evident in the song &quot;Material Girl&quot;. It opens with Madonna using a little-girl voice, but following the first verse, she switches to a richer, more mature voice in the <a href="chorus_effect" title="wikilink">chorus</a>.<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a> This mature artistic statement was visible in <em>True Blue</em> (1986). The song &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot; was a significant milestone in her artistic career. The classical introduction, fast tempo and the gravity in her voice was unprecedented in Madonna's &lt;U+0153&gt;uvre at that time.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a></p>
<p>With <em>Like a Prayer</em> (1989), Madonna again entered a new phase, musically. The album introduced live recorded songs and incorporated different genres of music, including dance, <a href="contemporary_R&amp;B" title="wikilink">R&amp;B</a> and gospel music.<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a> Madonna continued to compose ballads and <a href="uptempo" class="uri" title="wikilink">uptempo</a> dance songs for <em>Erotica</em> (1992) and <em>Bedtime Stories</em> (1994). She tried to remain contemporary by incorporating samples, drum loops and <a href="hip_hop_music" title="wikilink">hip hop</a> into her music. Her voice grew much deeper and fuller, evident in the tracks like &quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;Take a Bow&quot;.<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a> During the filming of <em>Evita</em>, Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, &quot;I studied with a vocal coach for <em>Evita</em> and I realized there was a whole piece of my voice I wasn't using. Before, I just believed I had a really limited range and was going to make the most of it.&quot;<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a> Continuing her musical evolution with <em>Ray of Light</em>, the track &quot;Frozen&quot; displayed her fully formed vocal prowess and her allusions to classical music. Her vocals were restrained and she sang the songs in <em>Ray of Light</em> without vibrato. However, the intake of breath within the songs became more prominent.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a> With the new millennium came her album <em>Music</em> in which Madonna sang in her normal voice in a medium range, and sometimes in a higher register for the chorus. Fouz-Hern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez commented that &quot;Throughout her career, Madonna's manipulation of her voice shows us that, by refusing to be defined in one way, she has in fact opened up a space for new kinds of musical analysis.&quot;<a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260"><sup>260</sup></a></p>

<p>According to Taraborrelli, &quot;Almost certainly, the defining moment of Madonna's childhood&lt;U+2014&gt;the one that would have the most influence in shaping her into the woman she would become&lt;U+2014&gt;was the tragic and untimely death of her beloved mother.&quot;<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a> Psychiatrist Keith Ablow suggests that her mother's death would have had an immeasurable impact on the young Madonna at a time when her personality was still forming. According to Ablow, the younger a child is at the time of a serious loss, the more profound the inluence and the longer lasting the impact. He concludes that &quot;some people never reconcile themselves to such a loss at an early age, Madonna is not different than them.&quot;<a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262"><sup>262</sup></a></p>
<p>As they grew older, Madonna and her sisters would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began drifting, farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come to think that she resembled poet <a href="Anne_Sexton" title="wikilink">Anne Sexton</a> and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry with <a href="Sylvia_Plath" title="wikilink">Sylvia Plath</a> being her favourite.<a href="#fn263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263"><sup>263</sup></a> Later, Madonna commented: &quot;We were all wounded in one way or another by [her death], and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying&lt;U+2014&gt;after I got over my heartache&lt;U+2014&gt;I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself.&quot;<a href="#fn264" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref264"><sup>264</sup></a> Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. &quot;Her death had taught her a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness&lt;U+2014&gt;particularly her own&lt;U+2014&gt;and wanted to be the queen of her own castle.&quot;<a href="#fn265" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref265"><sup>265</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1985, Madonna commented that the first song to ever make a strong impression on her was &quot;<a href="These_Boots_Are_Made_for_Walkin&#39;" title="wikilink">These Boots Are Made for Walkin'</a>&quot; by <a href="Nancy_Sinatra" title="wikilink">Nancy Sinatra</a>; she said it summed up her own &quot;take-charge attitude&quot;.<a href="#fn266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266"><sup>266</sup></a> As a young woman, she attempted to broaden her taste in literature, art, and music, and during this time became interested in classical music. She noted that her favorite style was <a href="baroque_music" title="wikilink">baroque</a>, and loved <a href="Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart" title="wikilink">Mozart</a> and <a href="Fr&lt;U+00E9&gt;d&lt;U+00E9&gt;ric_Chopin" title="wikilink">Chopin</a> because she liked their &quot;feminine quality&quot;.<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267"><sup>267</sup></a> Other musical influences included artists <a href="Karen_Carpenter" title="wikilink">Karen Carpenter</a>, <a href="The_Supremes" title="wikilink">The Supremes</a>, <a href="Led_Zeppelin" title="wikilink">Led Zeppelin</a>, and dancers such as <a href="Martha_Graham" title="wikilink">Martha Graham</a> and <a href="Rudolf_Nureyev" title="wikilink">Rudolf Nureyev</a>.<a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268"><sup>268</sup></a> Madonna's Italian-Catholic background and her relationship with her parents were reflected in the album <em>Like a Prayer</em>.<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269"><sup>269</sup></a> It was an evocation of the impact religion had on her career.<a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a> Her video for the title track contains Catholic symbolism, such as the stigmata.

<p>During her childhood, Madonna was inspired by actors, later saying, &quot;I loved <a href="Carole_Lombard" title="wikilink">Carole Lombard</a> and <a href="Judy_Holliday" title="wikilink">Judy Holliday</a> and <a href="Marilyn_Monroe" title="wikilink">Marilyn Monroe</a>. They were all incredibly funny ... and I saw myself in them ... my girlishness, my knowingness and my innocence.&quot;<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a> Her &quot;Material Girl&quot; music video recreated Monroe's look in the song &quot;<a href="Diamonds_Are_a_Girl&#39;s_Best_Friend" title="wikilink">Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend</a>&quot;, from the film <em><a href="Gentlemen_Prefer_Blondes_(film)" title="wikilink">Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</a></em>. She studied the screwball comedies of the 1930s, particularly those of Lombard, in preparation for the film <em>Who's That Girl</em>. The video for &quot;Express Yourself&quot; (1989) was inspired by <a href="Fritz_Lang" title="wikilink">Fritz Lang</a>'s <a href="silent_film" title="wikilink">silent film</a> <em><a href="Metropolis_(film)" title="wikilink">Metropolis</a></em> (1927).

Stephanie Zacharek, critic for <em>Time</em> magazine, stated that, &quot;[Madonna] seems wooden and unnatural as an actress, and it's tough to watch, because she's clearly trying her damnedest.&quot;<a href="#fn281" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref281"><sup>281</sup></a> According to biographer <a href="Andrew_Morton_(writer)" title="wikilink">Andrew Morton</a>, &quot;Madonna puts a brave face on the criticism, but privately she is deeply hurt.&quot;<a href="#fn282" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref282"><sup>282</sup></a> After the 2002 box-office bomb <em>Swept Away</em>, Madonna vowed that she would never act in a film, hoping that her repertoire as a bad actress will never be discussed again.<a href="#fn283" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref283"><sup>283</sup></a></p>
<p>Madonna is dedicated to <a href="Kabbalah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kabbalah</a> and in 2004, she adopted the name Esther which in <a href="Hebrew" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hebrew</a> means &quot;star&quot;.<a href="#fn284" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref284"><sup>284</sup></a> She has donated millions of dollars to New York and London schools teaching the subject.<a href="#fn285" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref285"><sup>285</sup></a><a href="#fn286" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref286"><sup>286</sup></a> After she joined the Jewish religion, she faced opposition from rabbis who felt Madonna's adoption of the Kabbalah was sacrilegious and a case of celebrity <a href="Society_of_Dilettanti" title="wikilink">dilettantism</a>.

According to scholar Bill Friskics-Warren, &quot;the ethereal arrangement of music in these albums and the philosophizing, replete with references to gurus and fate-fitting karma, at first may seem like New Age lyrics, but a deep analysis yields a sense of connection that encompasses spiritual illumination and carnal ecstacy, in effect erasing the distinction betwen the two, and is the effect of her oblique Kabbalistic meditation on union and transcendence.&quot;<a href="#fn288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref288"><sup>288</sup></a> During the Re-Invention World Tour, at one point in the show, Madonna and her dancers wore t-shirts that read &quot;Kabbalists Do It Better&quot;.<a href="#fn289" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref289"><sup>289</sup></a></p>

<p>In <em>The Madonna Companion</em>, biographers Allen Metz and Carol Benson noted that more than any other recent pop artist, Madonna had used MTV and music videos to establish her popularity and enhance her recorded work.<a href="#fn290" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref290"><sup>290</sup></a> According to them, many of her songs have the imagery of the music video in strong context, while referring to the music. The media and public reaction towards her most-discussed songs such as &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot;, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; or &quot;Justify My Love&quot; had to do with the music videos created to promote the song and their impact, rather than the song itself.<a href="#fn291" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref291"><sup>291</sup></a> Morton felt that &quot;artistically, Madonna's songwriting is often overshadowed by her striking pop videos.&quot;<a href="#fn292" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref292"><sup>292</sup></a> Madonna's initial music videos reflected her American and Hispanic mixed street style combined with a flamboyant glamor.<a href="#fn293" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref293"><sup>293</sup></a> She was able to transmit her avant-garde downtown New York fashion sense to the American audience.<a href="#fn294" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref294"><sup>294</sup></a> The imagery and incorporation of Hispanic culture and Catholic symbolism continued with the music videos from the <em>True Blue</em> era.<a href="#fn295" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref295"><sup>295</sup></a> Author <a href="Douglas_Kellner" title="wikilink">Douglas Kellner</a> noted, &quot;such 'multiculturalism' and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences&quot;.<a href="#fn296" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref296"><sup>296</sup></a> Madonna's Spanish look in the videos became the fashion trend of that time, in the form of boleros and layered skirts, accessorizing with rosary beads and a crucifix as in the video of &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;.<a href="#fn297" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref297"><sup>297</sup></a><a href="#fn298" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref298"><sup>298</sup></a> Academics noted that with her videos, Madonna was subtly reversing the usual role of male as the dominant sex.<a href="#fn299" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref299"><sup>299</sup></a> This symbolism and imagery was probably the most prevalent in the music video for &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;. The video included scenes of an African-American church choir, Madonna attracted to a statue of a black saint, and singing in front of burning crosses. This mix of the sacred and the profane upset the Vatican and resulted in the Pepsi commercial withdrawal.<a href="#fn300" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref300"><sup>300</sup></a></p>
<p>Madonna's emergence occurred during the advent of MTV, and, according to Chris Nelson from <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em>, &quot;with its almost exclusively <a href="lip-sync" title="wikilink">lip-synced</a> videos, ushered in an era in which average music fans might happily spend hours a day, every day, watching singers just mouth the words.&quot;<a href="#fn301" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref301"><sup>301</sup></a> The symbiotic relationship between the music video and lip-syncing led to a desire for the spectacle and imagery of the music video to be transferred to live stage shows. Chris Nelson of <em>The New York Times</em> reported, &quot;Artists like Madonna and <a href="Janet_Jackson" title="wikilink">Janet Jackson</a> set new standards for showmanship, with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing. These effects came at the expense of live singing.&quot;<a href="#fn302" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref302"><sup>302</sup></a> Thor Christensen of the <em><a href="Dallas_Morning_News" title="wikilink">Dallas Morning News</a></em> commented that while Madonna earned a reputation for lip-syncing during her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, she has subsequently reorganized her performances by &quot;stay[ing] mostly still during her toughest singing parts and [leaves] the dance routines to her backup troupe ... [r]ather than try to croon and dance up a storm at the same time.&quot;<a href="#fn303" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref303"><sup>303</sup></a> To allow for greater movement while dancing and singing, she was one of the earliest adopters of hands-free radio-frequency headset microphones, with the headset fastened over the ears or the top of the head, and the microphone capsule on a boom arm that extended to the mouth. Because of her prominent usage, the microphone design came to be known as the &quot;Madonna mic&quot;.<a href="#fn304" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref304"><sup>304</sup></a><a href="#fn305" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref305"><sup>305</sup></a></p>

<p>According to <em>Rolling Stone</em>, Madonna &quot;remains one of the greatest pop acts of all time&quot;.<a href="#fn306" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref306"><sup>306</sup></a> She has been dubbed the &quot;Queen of Pop&quot;, and is listed by <em>Guinness World Records</em> as the world's most successful female recording artist of all time.<a href="#fn307" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref307"><sup>307</sup></a> On March 10, 2008, Madonna was inducted into the <a href="Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in her first year of eligibility.<a href="#fn308" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref308"><sup>308</sup></a> <em>Billboard</em> magazine ranked her as the most successful solo artist (second overall, behind only <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a>) on the &quot;<a href="Billboard_Hot_100_50th_Anniversary_Charts#All-Time_top_artists" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn309" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref309"><sup>309</sup></a> She is also the most successful female solo artist in British chart history, with the most number one albums and number one singles.<a href="#fn310" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref310"><sup>310</sup></a> Madonna is featured in the book <em>100 Most Important Women of the 20th Century</em>, published by <a href="Ladies&#39;_Home_Journal" title="wikilink">Ladies' Home Journal</a> in 1998.<a href="#fn311" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref311"><sup>311</sup></a> In July 2003, she ranked seventh on <a href="VH1" class="uri" title="wikilink">VH1</a> and <em><a href="People_(magazine)" title="wikilink">People</a></em> magazine's list of the &quot;200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons of All Time.&quot;<a href="#fn312" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref312"><sup>312</sup></a> In 2006, a new <a href="water_bear" title="wikilink">water bear</a> species, <em>Echiniscus madonnae</em>, was named after her.<a href="#fn313" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref313"><sup>313</sup></a> The paper with the description of <em>E. madonnae</em> was published in the international journal of animal taxonomy <em><a href="Zootaxa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zootaxa</a></em> in March 2006 (Vol. 1154, pages: 1&lt;U+2013&gt;36).

<p>Throughout her career Madonna has repeatedly reinvented herself through a series of visual and musical personas. Fouz-Hern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez agrees that these reinventions are one of her key cultural achievements.<a href="#fn315" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref315"><sup>315</sup></a> Madonna reinvented herself by working with upcoming talented producers and previously unknown artists, while remaining at the center of media attention. According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, &quot;In doing so Madonna has provided an example of how to maintain one's career in the entertainment industry.&quot;<a href="#fn316" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref316"><sup>316</sup></a> Such reinvention was noted by scholars as the main tool in surviving the musical industry, for a female artist.<a href="#fn317" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref317"><sup>317</sup></a> As Ian Youngs from <a href="BBC_News" title="wikilink">BBC News</a> commented, &quot;Her ability to follow the latest trends and adapt her style has often been credited with preserving her appeal.&quot;<a href="#fn318" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref318"><sup>318</sup></a> Madonna's use of shocking sexual imagery has benefited her career and catalyzed public discourse on sexuality and feminism.<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319"><sup>319</sup></a> <em>The Times</em> stated, &quot;Madonna, whether you like her or not, started a revolution amongst women in music ... Her attitudes and opinions on sex, nudity, style and sexuality forced the public to sit up and take notice.&quot;<a href="#fn320" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref320"><sup>320</sup></a> Rodger Streitmatter, author of <em>Sex Sells!</em> (2004), commented that &quot;from the moment Madonna burst onto the nation's radar screen in the mid-1980s, she did everything in her power to shock the public, and her efforts paid off.&quot;<a href="#fn321" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref321"><sup>321</sup></a> Shmuel Boteach, author of <em>Hating women</em> (2005), felt that Madonna was largely responsible for erasing the line between music and pornography. He stated: &quot;Before Madonna, it was possible for women more famous for their voices than their cleavage, to emerge as music superstars. But in the post-Madonna universe, even highly original performers such as Janet Jackson now feel the pressure to expose their bodies on national television to sell albums.&quot;<a href="#fn322" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref322"><sup>322</sup></a></p>
<p>Madonna has influenced numerous music artists throughout her career. Mary Cross, in her book <em>Madonna: A Biography</em>, wrote: &quot;Her influence on pop music is undeniable and far-reaching. New pop icons from <a href="Nelly_Furtado" title="wikilink">Nelly Furtado</a> and <a href="Shakira" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shakira</a> to <a href="Gwen_Stefani" title="wikilink">Gwen Stefani</a> and <a href="Christina_Aguilera" title="wikilink">Christina Aguilera</a> (not to mention <a href="Britney_Spears" title="wikilink">Britney Spears</a>) owe Madonna, a debt of thanks for the template she forged, combining provocative sexiness and female power in her image, music, and lyrics.&quot;<a href="#fn323" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref323"><sup>323</sup></a> Fouz-Hern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez gave his opinion that female pop performers such as Spears, the <a href="Spice_Girls" title="wikilink">Spice Girls</a>, <a href="Destiny&#39;s_Child" title="wikilink">Destiny's Child</a>, <a href="Jennifer_Lopez" title="wikilink">Jennifer Lopez</a>, <a href="Kylie_Minogue" title="wikilink">Kylie Minogue</a> and <a href="Pink_(singer)" title="wikilink">Pink</a> were like &quot;Madonna's daughters in the very direct sense that they grew up listening to and admiring Madonna, and decided they wanted to be like her.&quot;<a href="#fn324" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref324"><sup>324</sup></a> Among them, Madonna's influence was most notable in Spears, who has been called her prot&lt;U+00E9&gt;g&lt;U+00E9&gt;.<a href="#fn325" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref325"><sup>325</sup></a> Madonna has also been credited with the introduction of European <a href="electronic_dance" title="wikilink">electronic dance</a> music into mainstream American pop culture, and for bringing European producers such as <a href="Stuart_Price" title="wikilink">Stuart Price</a> and <a href="Mirwais_Ahmadza&lt;U+00EF&gt;" title="wikilink">Mirwais Ahmadza&lt;U+00EF&gt;</a> into the spotlight.<a href="#fn326" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref326"><sup>326</sup></a> According to the <a href="International_Federation_of_the_Phonographic_Industry" title="wikilink">International Federation of the Phonographic Industry</a>, Madonna has sold more than 200 million albums worldwide.<a href="#fn327" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref327"><sup>327</sup></a> She is ranked by the <a href="Recording_Industry_Association_of_America" title="wikilink">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) as the best-selling female rock artist of the 20th century, and the second top-selling female artist in the United States behind <a href="Barbra_Streisand" title="wikilink">Barbra Streisand</a>, with 64 million <a href="RIAA_certification" title="wikilink">certified</a> albums sold.<a href="#fn328" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref328"><sup>328</sup></a><a href="#fn329" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref329"><sup>329</sup></a></p>
<p>Madonna has received acclaim as a role model for businesswomen in her industry, &quot;achieving the kind of financial control that women had long fought for within the industry&quot;, and generating over $1.2 billion in sales within the first decade of her career.<a href="#fn330" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref330"><sup>330</sup></a> After its establishment, Maverick Records became a major commercial success from her efforts, which was unusual at that time for an artist-established label.<a href="#fn331" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref331"><sup>331</sup></a> <em>Guinness World Records</em> names Madonna as the world's highest-earning female singer, after making &lt;U+00A3&gt;26.6 million in 2004 alone.<a href="#fn332" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref332"><sup>332</sup></a> Music journalist Robert Sandall said that while interviewing Madonna, it was clear that being &quot;a cultural big hitter&quot; was more important to her than pop music, a career she described as &quot;an accident&quot;. He also saw a contrast between her anything-goes sexual public persona and a secretive and &quot;paranoid&quot; attitude toward her own finances; she fired her own brother when he charged her for an extra item.<a href="#fn333" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref333"><sup>333</sup></a> <a href="London_Business_School" title="wikilink">London Business School</a> academics called her a &quot;dynamic entrepreneur&quot; worth copying; they identified her vision of success, her understanding of the music industry, her ability to recognize her own performance limits (and thus bring in help), her willingness to work hard and her ability to adapt as the key to her commercial success.<a href="#fn334" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref334"><sup>334</sup></a> Conversely, reporter Michael McWilliams commented: &quot;The gripes about Madonna&lt;U+2014&gt;[she] conceals both bigotry and the essence of her art, which is among the warmest, the most humane, the most profoundly satisfying in all pop culture.&quot;<a href="#fn335" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref335"><sup>335</sup></a> Morton commented that &quot;Madonna is oportunistic, manipulative and ruthless&lt;U+2014&gt;somebody who won't stop untill she gets what she wants&lt;U+2014&gt;and that's something you can get at the expense of maybe losing your closed ones. But that hardly mattered to her.&quot;<a href="#fn336" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref336"><sup>336</sup></a> Taraborrelli felt that this ruthlessness was visible during the shooting of the Pepsi commercial in 1989. &quot;The fact that she didn't want to hold a Pepsi can in the commercial, clued the Pepsi executives that Madonna the pop star and Madonna the businesswoman were not going to be dictated by somebody else, she will do everything in her way&lt;U+2014&gt;the only way.&quot;<a href="#fn337" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref337"><sup>337</sup></a></p>
