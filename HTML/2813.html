<p>Until very recently, the French pre-hospital care strategy was based on either <a href="certified_first_responder" title="wikilink">first responders</a> (<a href="firemen" class="uri" title="wikilink">firemen</a>) or prehospital medical teams (<a href="Doctor_of_Medicine" title="wikilink">MD</a> + <a href="nurse" class="uri" title="wikilink">nurse</a> + <a href="ambulance" class="uri" title="wikilink">ambulance</a> driver) called <a href="Smur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Smur</a> (<em>service mobile d'urgence et de r&lt;U+00E9&gt;animation</em>, emergency resuscitation mobile unit). With this organisation, any situation requiring a paramedic is handled by a physician who specialises in pre-hospital emergencies.</p>
<p>Due to a lack of physicians, interhospital transportation requiring intensive care was often performed by an ambulance driver and a nurse working on protocol, although it was not entirely legal (the nurses are allowed to apply a medical protocol, but the definition of a Smur necessarily includes an MD). In any case, the protocols had to be written specifically for a given patient, so such protocols could not be used for pre-hospital emergencies (the patient was not seen by the MD who wrote the protocol).</p>
<p>The legislation evolved in <a href="1997" class="uri" title="wikilink">1997</a>, and nurses belonging to a <a href="sapeur-pompier" title="wikilink">fire department</a> (or ISPâ€“<em>infirmier sapeur-pompier</em>) can now apply emergency protocols in pre-hospital situations, in the same way as paramedics. They can also receive oral prescriptions by phone or radio and thus provide specialised care.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no specific paramedic profession in France, but the existing nursing profession have evolved to meet the needs of pre-hospital care.</p>
