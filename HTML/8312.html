<p><strong>The School for Creative and Performing Arts (SCPA)</strong> is a <a href="magnet_school" title="wikilink">magnet</a> arts school in <a href="Cincinnati,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Cincinnati, Ohio</a> and part of the <a href="Cincinnati_Public_Schools" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Public Schools</a> (CPS). SCPA was founded in 1973 as one of the first magnet schools in Cincinnati and became the first school in the country to combine a full range of arts studies with a complete <a href="University-preparatory_school" title="wikilink">college-preparatory</a> academic program for elementary through high school students. Of the approximately 350 arts schools in the United States, SCPA is one of the oldest and has been cited as a model for both <a href="racial_integration" title="wikilink">racial integration</a> and for arts programs in over 100 cities.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>SCPA had three different homes in its first four years, including a makeshift campus in the <a href="Mount_Adams,_Cincinnati" title="wikilink">Mount Adams</a> neighborhood and another in <a href="Roselawn,_Cincinnati" title="wikilink">Roselawn</a>. In 1976, it occupied the Old <a href="Woodward_High_School_(Cincinnati,_Ohio)" title="wikilink">Woodward High School</a> building, on the site of one of the oldest public schools in the country. The school rose to national prominence in the 1980s, but was nearly closed in the 1990s following a series of scandals, leadership struggles, and an arson fire which destroyed the auditorium. Its reputation recovered in the years that followed and in 2009&lt;U+2013&gt;10, the school was featured in the <a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a> reality series <em><a href="Taking_the_Stage" title="wikilink">Taking the Stage</a></em>, filmed at the school and featuring SCPA students. In 2010 SCPA combined with the Schiel Primary School for Arts Enrichment to create the first <a href="kindergarten" class="uri" title="wikilink">kindergarten</a> through <a href="twelfth_grade" title="wikilink">twelfth grade</a> (about ages five to seventeen) arts school and first private sector/public arts school in the US. A new facility in <a href="Over-the-Rhine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Over-the-Rhine</a> was championed by the late <a href="Cincinnati_Pops" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Pops</a> <a href="Maestro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maestro</a> <a href="Erich_Kunzel" title="wikilink">Erich Kunzel</a> and funded through a unique public-private partnership that raised over $31 million in private contributions to match public funding. The building features specialized facilities for the arts and three separate theaters and is the key to redevelopment plans for the area.</p>
<p>Students must audition for admission; fewer than 20 percent of those who apply each year are accepted. SCPA is free to CPS students but also attracts tuition-paying students from outside the district and the state. The newly combined school will serve approximately 1,300 students in 2010, offering a curriculum designed to prepare students for professional careers in <a href="creative_writing" title="wikilink">creative writing</a>, <a href="dance" class="uri" title="wikilink">dance</a>, <a href="drama" class="uri" title="wikilink">drama</a>, <a href="music" class="uri" title="wikilink">music</a>, <a href="Stagecraft" title="wikilink">technical theater</a>, and <a href="visual_arts" title="wikilink">visual art</a>. The emphasis is on performance, and students in every field are required to perform or present their work in public regularly. Students compete successfully in arts competitions locally and internationally. On <a href="standardized_test" title="wikilink">standardized tests</a>, SCPA ranks second among Cincinnati public schools. Ninety percent of graduating seniors continue on to college, and those students receive one of the highest levels of scholarship funding in the city. A limited number of extracurricular activities are offered, as students are expected to commit significant after-school time to training and performance. SCPA has produced notable graduates in a wide range of artistic fields, including award-winning actors, singers, directors and technicians.</p>

In a 1965 civil rights suit, the city prevailed when a federal judge found that the schools were not intentionally segregated, but that &quot;the racial composition of each school is simply a result of the racial composition of the neighborhoods which they serve&quot;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> By 1971, Cincinnati's neighborhoods and schools had grown more segregated and the <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Supreme Court of the United States</a> upheld <a href="forced_busing" title="wikilink">forced busing</a> as a remedy for school segregation in other cities.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Desiring to avoid such drastic remedies for Cincinnati, newly appointed Superintendent Dr. Donald Waldrip pushed forward a program of <a href="Magnet_school" title="wikilink">alternative schools</a> (later called magnet schools), designed &quot;to calm the desires of parents for academic choice and to stem the demands of federal judges for court-ordered desegregation.&quot; The theory behind alternative schools was <a href="school_choice" title="wikilink">open enrollment</a>: students could attend any alternative school they chose at no cost, so long as an even racial balance at the new school was maintained. So far as possible, students were admitted to these programs on a one white for one black basis. The School for Creative and Performing Arts was the first alternative school in what would become one of the largest and most robust magnet programs in the country.</p>
<p>In 1965, Robert McSpadden and Bill Dickinson, both music teachers in the Cincinnati Public Schools, founded the Cincinnati All-City Boy Choir, where they were struck by how the discipline they established for the boys in the choir carried over into their academic studies.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> They conceived the idea of a school where basic education was combined with intensive attention to children with artistic talents.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> With the support of Waldrip and Tom Murray, director for the west-central division of Cincinnati elementary schools, they pushed for $119,000 as part of a tax levy referendum in May 1973; the measure was defeated. The school was approved with a drastically reduced budget of $27,000 plus $9,850 from the Board of Education&lt;U+2019&gt;s general fund. They turned to private funding and won a $292,000 grant from J. Ralph Corbett, one of the city's foremost philanthropists for the arts, and $24,500 for a piano lab from the <a href="Baldwin_Piano_Company" title="wikilink">Baldwin Piano Company</a>, which had manufactured pianos in Cincinnati since 1891.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The School for Creative and Performing Arts opened in August 1973, as the only <a href="fourth_grade" title="wikilink">grade four</a> through <a href="sixth_grade" title="wikilink">six</a> school for the performing arts in the country and the first public school that combined all of the arts in a single program.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The curriculum included art, <a href="instrumental" class="uri" title="wikilink">instrumental</a> music, <a href="choir" title="wikilink">choral music</a>, dance and drama, and was not organized strictly by grade, but permitted students to advance as soon as their abilities allowed.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Murray explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fourth through sixth grades will be together in classes. Teaching will often be done in teams. Art students will design scenery for plays, written by drama students. Music pupils will supply the music. They work together regardless of age. In reading classes they will read according to their own individual levels. A brilliant music student, capable of interpreting Beethoven's wildest dreams, might stumble on fifth level reading. This does not make him a dunce simply a slow reader.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

A dozen of the Mount Adams <a href="middle_school" title="wikilink">middle school</a> students were accepted into the new program, along with the 140 other fourth through sixth grade pupils selected from schools around the city by audition.</p>
<p>By 1974, SCPA had 332 students, with 500 on the waiting list, and had overflowed into rented space in the surrounding neighborhood, including three rooms at the nearby Holy Cross School, two rooms at the community center two blocks away, and large room for drama above Mike's Meat Market across the street. Students practiced instruments in hallways and restrooms, and the library was in the middle of the second floor hall. Student productions were held in other schools around the city, and the first major musical, <a href="Babes_in_Toyland_(operetta)" title="wikilink"><em>Babes in Toyland</em></a>, was performed at Education Center downtown. With plans to expand to <a href="ninth_grade" title="wikilink">ninth grade</a> (around age 14) and 540 students in 1975, and to <a href="twelfth_grade" title="wikilink">twelfth grade</a> (around age 17) and 1,400 students in 1977, a new facility had to be found.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Waldrip proposed the school move to the Old Woodward school building, then home of Abigail Cutter <a href="Junior_High_School" title="wikilink">Junior High School</a>, in <a href="Over-the-Rhine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Over-the-Rhine</a>, a predominantly African-American area near downtown.

<p>Temporary space was needed in the interim, and the school relocated its 550 fourth through ninth grade students to rented space in <a href="Roselawn,_Cincinnati" title="wikilink">Roselawn</a>, the epicenter of Cincinnati's Jewish Community.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The school was divided between two buildings, the <a href="Yavneh_Day_School_(Cincinnati,_Ohio)" title="wikilink">Yavneh Day School</a> building at 1636 Summit Road and the nearby Jewish Community Center.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The Yavneh Day school, founded in 1952 by parents who wanted to combine secular and Jewish education for their children, moved to Roselawn in 1958 but had outgrown that facility.

<p>Dickinson became principal in 1975, and worked to fully integrate the arts into the academic program. &quot;Academics don't end when art, drama or music classes begin,&quot; he said, &quot;but blend, in an interdisciplinary approach to education.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Music study included acoustics and the history and architecture of important musical periods; art history was part of the art curriculum and anatomy and physiology were studied in the dance program.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The school was recognized with <em><a href="The_Cincinnati_Post" title="wikilink">The Cincinnati Post</a>'s</em> Corbett Award in 1976 as &quot;the arts organization making an outstanding contribution to the community&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The Union Terminal project was derailed when the three prospective tenants failed to agree on how to share the space.

<h2 id="admission">Admission</h2>
<p>The school has been criticized as &quot;elitist&quot; for its selective admission policies. Prospective students are evaluated on their artistic sensitivity and potential. Students entering grades four through six are required to audition in every arts major; older students may audition in only the areas they choose.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Each applicant performs in front of up to seven teachers in different areas in the day-long process, which is designed to ensure that no student is admitted to a program in which they do not belong. Admission is granted to students scoring 8 out of 10 points in at least one area. On average, 1,700 students apply each year, 1,000 are invited to audition, and 250 are accepted.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Attendance is free for Cincinnati Public School students.

<p>As a magnet school founded to promote school integration, racial and economic diversity have been important factors in admissions decisions.

Each student concentrates in at least one major area: creative writing, dance, drama, music, <a href="technical_theater" title="wikilink">stagecraft</a>, and visual art. Younger students often concentrate in two or more. High school students are required to specialize and major only in the areas in which they have potential to do professional work.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Advanced students study up to two hours each day in their major. Forty percent of the students stay at least two hours after school for rehearsals, private lessons, and productions.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>The program stresses discipline and performance. There are no appreciation courses; the curriculum emphasizes that arts appreciation grows from practicing an art. The interrelation of the arts is also stressed. All students take at least one course in each major area. A dancer, for example, will be required to study visual art, drama, and music.</p>
<p>The visual arts program includes drawing, painting, photography, sculpting, digital art, and art history. The program is highly structured, emphasizing technique and control over free expression, which has attracted criticism from the local art community. Art students receive individualized instruction, participate in art exhibits and competitions, undertake commissioned work, and work in in-house galleries and off-site exhibits. Most art majors take Advanced Placement art courses by the end of their sophomore year, and many attend pre-college programs at major universities between their high school years.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<p>The drama program stresses technique and performance; students must perform in public at least twice a year. There are three major dramatic productions each season, and high school students are required to compete in the <a href="English_Speaking_Union" title="wikilink">English Speaking Union</a> Shakespeare Contest. Advanced students audition for the Acting Ensemble Company, which provides a full season of performances in venues outside the school.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> The creative writing program focuses on writing as an art in journalism, script writing, poetry, and creative non-fiction.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> Students participate in writing competitions, internships, and develop portfolios to showcase their work.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
<p>The dance program was founded on the training principles of the &quot;most famous dance schools of Europe&quot;, which emphasize body training. All dancers are required to study ballet, but may also learn modern dance, jazz, tap, and other forms of dance. There are nine levels of ballet, and students begin intensive training in fourth grade. Dance classes meet for at least two 45-minute periods every day; advanced students may train for three or more. Dance Ensemble, selected by audition, stages public performances throughout the year.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>The instrumental music program offers specializations in orchestra, band, piano, percussion, and harp. Students major in an instrument and specialized training begins in grade four. Advanced students take private lessons, arranged by the school, and have master classes with guest instructors from the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Vocal music students audition to perform in one of 13 vocal performance groups. High school students may audition for the most selective of these, &quot;13th &amp; Broadway&quot;, which performs throughout the region.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>

It is a learning experience for younger students, but students in grades 7&lt;U+2013&gt;12 who fail to attain a passing rating are placed on probation and must pass their subsequent review to be allowed to continue in that major. Students must audition if they wish to change majors for the following year.</p>
<p>The highlight of the performance season is a major musical production which is an important source of revenue for the school.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a><a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> There are two ballets each year: <em><a href="The_Nutcracker" title="wikilink">The Nutcracker</a></em> in the winter and a piece from repertoire in the spring.
