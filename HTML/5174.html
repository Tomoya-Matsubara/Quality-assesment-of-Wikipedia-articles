<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>Poornima is a young girl from a middle-class family who meets a young man (Mohan), who is the womanising son of a well-known lawyer (Jaishankar). After they have dated each other for some time, she finds that she is pregnant. However, Mohan shirks his responsibility and refuses to marry her. She does not want an abortion as suggested by her parents, and tells them that she wants to take Mohan to court. Her parents throw her out and 'disown' her. Left alone, she decides to bring Mohan to justice. She meets Sujatha, a lawyer who works for woman's rights.</p>
<p>In the past, Sujatha had been Jaishankar's lover, and as a result she gave birth to a daughter. Sujatha doesn't want to see her own experience repeated and drags Mohan to court. She wins the court case and her quest for justice is rewarded. After losing the case, Mohan decides to marry Poornima and give their illegitimate child his family name. Poornima disagrees and decides that she can manage on her own and does not need Mohan's support.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Sujatha dies of a heart attack. Poornima promises her to take care of her daughter, and carries on her work.</p>
