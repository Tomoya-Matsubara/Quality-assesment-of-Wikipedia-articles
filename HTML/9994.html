<p><strong>Andranik Ozanian</strong>, commonly known as <a href="Mononymous_person" title="wikilink">simply</a> <strong>Andranik</strong> (), (25 February 186531 August 1927) was an <a href="Armenians" title="wikilink">Armenian</a> military commander and statesman, the most famous <em><a href="Armenian_fedayi" title="wikilink">fedayi</a></em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and a key figure of the <a href="Armenian_national_liberation_movement" title="wikilink">Armenian national liberation movement</a>. Andranik became active in the Armenian armed struggle against the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman</a> government and Kurdish irregulars in the late 1880s. He joined the <a href="Armenian_Revolutionary_Federation" title="wikilink">Armenian Revolutionary Federation</a> (Dashnaktustyun) party and along other <em>fedayi</em>, Andranik sought to defend the Armenian peasantry living in their ancestral homeland, at the time part of the Ottoman Empire, an area known as <a href="Western_Armenia" title="wikilink">Turkish (or Western) Armenia</a>. His revolutionary activities ceased in 1904, when he left the Ottoman Empire. In 1907, being a leading member of the party, Andranik left Dashnaktustyun because of disagreement with its cooperation with the <a href="Young_Turks" title="wikilink">Young Turks</a>, a party which years later perpetrated the <a href="Armenian_Genocide" title="wikilink">Armenian Genocide</a>. In 1912&lt;U+2013&gt;1913, together with <a href="Garegin_Nzhdeh" title="wikilink">Garegin Nzhdeh</a>, Andranik led the Armenian volunteers within the Bulgarian army against the Ottomans during the <a href="First_Balkan_War" title="wikilink">First Balkan War</a>.</p>
<p>Since the early stages of <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, Andranik commanded the first <a href="Armenian_volunteer_battalion" title="wikilink">Armenian volunteer battalion</a> and led them against the Ottoman army within the Russian Imperial army. After the <a href="Revolution_of_1917" title="wikilink">Revolution of 1917</a>, the Russian army retreated and left the Armenian irregulars against the outnumbering Turks. Andranik led the defense of Erzurum in the early 1918, but was forced to retreat eastward. By May 1918 the Turkish forces stood near the future Armenian capital <a href="Yerevan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yerevan</a>. The Dashank-dominated Armenian National Council declared the independence of Armenia and signed the <a href="Treaty_of_Batum" title="wikilink">Treaty of Batum</a> with the Ottoman Empire, by which Armenia gave up its rights to Western Armenia. He never accepted the existence of the <a href="First_Republic_of_Armenia" title="wikilink">First Republic of Armenia</a>, because it included only a small part of the area many Armenians hoped to make independent. Andranik, independently from the Republic of Armenia, fought in Zangezur against the <a href="Azerbaijan_Democratic_Republic" title="wikilink">Azerbaijani</a> and <a href="Army_of_Islam_(Ottoman_Empire)" title="wikilink">Turkish</a> armies and helped to keep it within Armenia.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>General Andranik left Armenia in 1919. He spent his last years of life in Europe and the United States. He settled in Fresno, California in 1922 and died five years later in 1927. Andranik is greatly admired as a <a href="Folk_hero" title="wikilink">national hero</a> by Armenians. Numerous statues of Andranik have been erected in several countries. Streets and squares were named after Andranik, keeping his memory alive among Armenians. Songs, poems and novels have been written about Andranik, making him a legend-like figure in the Armenian culture.</p>

<h3 id="early-life">Early life</h3>
<p>Andranik Ozanian was born on 25 February 1865<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> in <a href="&lt;U+015E&gt;ebinkarahisar" title="wikilink">Shabin-Karahisar</a>, <a href="Sivas_Vilayet" title="wikilink">Sivas Vilayet</a>, <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a> (today in <a href="Giresun_Province" title="wikilink">Giresun Province</a>, <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a>) to Mariam and Toros Ozanian. <a href=":wikt:&lt;U+0531&gt;&lt;U+0576&gt;&lt;U+0564&gt;&lt;U+0580&gt;&lt;U+0561&gt;&lt;U+0576&gt;&lt;U+056B&gt;&lt;U+056F&gt;" title="wikilink">Andranik</a> means &quot;firstborn&quot; in Armenian. His paternal ancestors came from the nearby Ozan village in the early 18th century and settled in Shabin-Karahisar to avoid persecution from the Turks. His ancestors took the surname Ozanian in honor of their hometown. Andranik's mother died when he was one year old and his elder sister Nazeli took care of him. Andranik went to the local Musheghian School from 1875 to 1882 and thereafter worked in his father's carpentry shop. He married at the age of 17, but his wife died a year later while giving birth to their son, who also died days after the birth.</p>
<p>The situation of the <a href="Armenians_in_the_Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Armenians in the Ottoman Empire</a> had worsened under the reign of <a href="Abdul_Hamid_II" title="wikilink">Abdul Hamid II</a>, who sought to unify all Muslims under his rule.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In 1882 Andranik was arrested for assaulting a Turkish <em><a href="Turkish_gendarmerie" title="wikilink">gendarme</a></em> for mistreating Armenians. With the help of his friends, he managed to escape from prison. He settled in the Ottoman capital <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a> in 1884 and stayed there until 1886 working as a carpenter. He began his revolutionary activities in 1888 in the <a href="Sivas_Vilayet" title="wikilink">province of Sivas</a>. He joined the <a href="Social_Democrat_Hunchakian_Party" title="wikilink">Hunchak</a> party in 1891. Andranik was again arrested in 1892 for taking part in assassinating Constantinople's police chief, Yusup Mehmet Bey, famed for his <a href="anti-Armenianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-Armenianism</a>, on 9 February. Andranik once again escaped from prison. In 1892 he joined the newly created <a href="Armenian_Revolutionary_Federation" title="wikilink">Armenian Revolutionary Federation</a> (ARF or Dashnaktsutyun). In 1894&lt;U+2013&gt;95, during the <a href="Hamidian_massacres" title="wikilink">Hamidian massacres</a>, Andranik with other <em>fedayi</em> defended the Armenian villages of <a href="Mu&lt;U+015F&gt;" title="wikilink">Mush</a> and <a href="Sasun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sasun</a> from the attacks of the Turks and the Kurdish <em><a href="Hamidiye_(cavalry)" title="wikilink">Hamidiye</a></em> units. The massacres, named after Sultan <a href="Abdul_Hamid_II" title="wikilink">Abdul Hamid II</a>, took the lives of estimated 80,000 to 300,000 between 1894 and 1896.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1897, Andranik went to <a href="Tiflis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tiflis</a>, the largest city of the <a href="Caucasus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caucasus</a> and a major center of Armenian culture at the time, where the ARF headquarters was located. Andranik returned to Turkish Armenia &quot;entrusted with extensive powers, and with a large supply of arms&quot; for the <em>fedayi</em>. Additionally, several dozens of Russian Armenians joined him, with whom he went to the Mush-Sasun area, where <a href="Aghbiur_Serob" title="wikilink">Aghbiur Serob</a> was operating. Serob's forces had already established semi-independent Armenian areas by expelling the Ottoman government representatives.</p>
<h3 id="leader-of-the-fedayi">Leader of the <em>fedayi</em></h3>

<p><a href="Aghbiur_Serob" title="wikilink">Aghbiur Serob</a>, the main leader of the <em><a href="Armenian_fedayi" title="wikilink">fedayi</a></em> in the 1890s, was killed in 1899 by a <a href="Kurds" title="wikilink">Kurdish</a> chieftain, Bushare Khalil Bey. Months later, the chieftain committed further atrocities against the Armenians by killing a priest, two young men and 25 women and children in Sasun's village of Talvorik. Andranik replaced Serob as the head of the Armenian irregular forces &quot;with 38 villages under his command&quot; in the <a href="Mu&lt;U+015F&gt;" title="wikilink">Mush</a>-<a href="Sasun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sasun</a> region of <a href="Western_Armenia" title="wikilink">Western Armenia</a>, where a &quot;warlike semi-independent Armenian peasantry&quot; lived. After Andranik became the leader of the <em>fedayi</em>, he pursued the goal of assassinating Bushare Khalil. Andranik succeeded in capturing Bushare Khalil and reportedly <a href="decapitating" class="uri" title="wikilink">decapitating</a> him, and taking the medal given to him by Sultan <a href="Abdul_Hamid_II" title="wikilink">Abdul Hamid II</a>. Andranik thus earned an undisputed authority among his <em>fedayi</em>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <img src="Armenian_monastery_of_s_apostles_in_moush.jpg" title="fig:The Holy Apostles Monastery of Mush" alt="The Holy Apostles Monastery of Mush" width="265" /> Although small groups of Armenian <em>fedayi</em> conducted an armed struggle against the Ottoman state and the Kurdish tribes, the situation in <a href="Turkish_Armenia" title="wikilink">Turkish Armenia</a> worsened as the European powers stood indifferent of the <a href="Armenian_Question" title="wikilink">Armenian Question</a>. The article 61 of the 1878 <a href="Treaty_of_Berlin_(1878)" title="wikilink">Treaty of Berlin</a> intended the Ottoman government to &quot;carry out, without further delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the Circassians and Kurds&quot; remained unimplemented.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <a href="Christopher_J._Walker" title="wikilink">Christopher J. Walker</a> argues that the attention of the European powers was on <a href="Macedonia_(region)" title="wikilink">Macedonia</a>, while Russia was &quot;in no mood for reactivating the Armenian question.&quot;</p>
<h4 id="battle-of-holy-apostles-monastery">Battle of Holy Apostles Monastery</h4>
<p>In November 1901, the <a href="Battle_of_Holy_Apostles_Monastery" title="wikilink">Battle of Holy Apostles Monastery</a> took place near <a href="Mu&lt;U+015F&gt;" title="wikilink">Mush</a>. This clash between the Ottoman troops and the <em>fedayi</em> became one of the best-known episodes of Andranik's revolutionary activities. Since Andranik had gained more influence over the region, more than 5,000 Turkish soldiers were sent after him and his band. The Turks chased and eventually circled him and his men, numbering around 50, at the <a href="Holy_Apostles_Monastery" title="wikilink">Holy Apostles Monastery</a> (also known as Arakelots) in early November. A regiment under the command of Ferikh Pasha and Ali Pasha besieged the fort-like monastery. The Turkish generals leading the army of twelve hundred men asked the <em>fedayi</em> to negotiate their surrender.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Andranik_on_a_horse.jpg" title="fig:Andranik on his horse, early 1900s" alt="Andranik on his horse, early 1900s" width="190" /> After weeks of resistance and negotiations, in which Armenian clergy as well as the headman of Mush and foreign consuls took part, Andranik and his companions succeeded in leaving the Arakelots monastery and fleeing in small groups. According to <a href="Leon_Trotsky" title="wikilink">Leon Trotsky</a>, Andranik, dressed in the uniform of a Turkish officer, &quot;went the rounds of the entire guard, talking to them in excellent Turkish&quot;, and &quot;at the same time showing the way out to his own men.&quot; After breaking through the siege of the monastery Andranik gained legendary stature among provincial Armenians. Such was the popularity of Andranik that the men he led came to refer to him always by his first name.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Andranik's intention was to attract the attention of the foreign consuls at Mush to the plight of the Armenian peasants and to provide a glimmer of hope for the oppressed Armenians of the eastern provinces.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> According to Trotsky, Andranik's &quot;political think took shape in a setting of <a href="Carbonari" title="wikilink">Carbonarist</a> activity and diplomatic intrigue.&quot;</p>
<h4 id="sasun-uprising-and-exodus">1904 Sasun uprising and exodus</h4>

<p>In 1903 Andranik demanded the Ottoman government stop the harassment of the Armenian population and implement the reforms in the Armenian provinces. In the past and at that time, most <em>fedayi</em> were concentrated in mountainous <a href="Sasun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sasun</a>, an area of about 12,000 km<sup>2</sup> with an overwhelming Armenian majority, traditionally considered their main operational area. The region was in &quot;a state of revolutionary turmoil&quot; due to the fact that the local Armenians had refused to pay taxes for the past seven years. Andranik, along with tens of other <em>fedayi</em>, including <a href="Hrayr_Dzhoghk" title="wikilink">Hrayr</a> and <a href="Sebouh_Nersesian" title="wikilink">Sebouh</a>, held a meeting at Gelieguzan village in autumn 1903 to manage the future defense of the Armenian villages form possible Turkish and Kurdish attacks. At that meeting, Andranik suggested a widespread uprising of the Armenians of <a href="Taron_(historic_Armenia)" title="wikilink">Taron</a> and <a href="Vaspurakan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vaspurakan</a>, while Hrayr opposed his view and suggested a small, local uprising solely in Sasun, because the Armenian irregulars lacked resources. Hrayr's suggestion was eventually approved by the <em>fedayi</em> meeting. Andranik was chosen as the main commander of the uprising.</p>
<p><img src="Location_of_the_1894_and_1904_Sasun_uprisings.png" title="fig:The location of the Sasun uprising (orange) and the Bitlis Vilayet (yellow)." alt="The location of the Sasun uprising (orange) and the Bitlis Vilayet (yellow)." width="250" /> The first clashes took place in January 1904 between the <em>fedayi</em> and Kurdish irregulars, supported by the Ottoman government. The Turkish offense started in early April. According to various estimates, 10,000 to 20,000 Turkish soldiers and some 7,000 Kurdish irregulars were put against 100 to 200 <em>fedayi</em> and 700 to 1,000 local Armenian men. <a href="Hrayr_Dzhoghk" title="wikilink">Hrayr</a> was killed during the intense fighting, while Andranik survived and resumed the struggle. Between 7,000 and 10,000 Armenian civilians were massacred during the two months of the uprising, while abut 9,000 were left homeless. Some 4,000 Sasun villagers were forced into exile after the uprising.</p>
<p>After weeks of fighting and bombardment of the Armenian villages by <a href="cannon" title="wikilink">cannons</a>, the Ottoman forces, accompanied by Kurdish irregulars successfully suppressed the uprising by May 1904 due to the fact that they outnumbered the Armenian forces several times. Minor clashes occurred thereafter as well. According to <a href="Christopher_J._Walker" title="wikilink">Christopher J. Walker</a>, the <em>fedayi</em> &quot;come near to organising an uprising and shaking Ottoman power in Armenia&quot;, however, &quot;even then it was unthinkable that the empire would lose any of her territory, since the idea of intervention was far from Russia.&quot; Trotsky argues that the international attention was on the <a href="Russo-Japanese_War" title="wikilink">Russo-Japanese War</a> and the uprising went largely ignored by the European powers and Russia.</p>
<p>In July&lt;U+2013&gt;August, Andranik and his <em>fedayi</em> reached <a href="Lake_Van" title="wikilink">Lake Van</a> and got to <a href="Aghtamar_Island" title="wikilink">Aghtamar Island</a> with sailing ships. They moved to <a href="Qajar_dynasty" title="wikilink">Persia</a> via <a href="Van,_Turkey" title="wikilink">Van</a> in September 1904, &quot;leaving little more than a heroic memory.&quot; Trotsky states that they were forced to leave Turkish Armenia in order to stop further massacres of Armenians and lower the tensions, while <a href="Tsatur_Aghayan" title="wikilink">Tsatur Aghayan</a> suggests that the reason why Andranik left the Ottoman Empire was that he sought to &quot;gather new resources and find practical programs&quot; for the Armenian struggle.</p>

<p>After leaving the Ottoman Empire, Andranik moved to the <a href="Caucasus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caucasus</a> through Persia, where he met the Armenian leaders in <a href="Baku" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baku</a> and <a href="Tiflis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tiflis</a>. He then left Russian and traveled to Europe, where he was engaged in advocacy in support of the national liberation struggle of the Ottoman Armenians. In 1906, he published a book on military tactics in <a href="Geneva" class="uri" title="wikilink">Geneva</a>, Switzerland in the ARF publishing.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The large portion of the work was about his activities and the strategies he used during the 1904 Sasun uprising.</p>
<p>In February&lt;U+2013&gt;March 1907, Andranik went to <a href="Vienna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vienna</a>, Austria to participate in the fourth ARF Congress. The ARF, which had been associating with Turkish immigrant political groups in Europe since 1902, discussed and approved the negotiations with the <a href="Young_Turks" title="wikilink">Young Turks</a> (who later perpetrated the <a href="Armenian_Genocide" title="wikilink">Armenian Genocide</a>) to overthrow Sultan <a href="Abdul_Hamid_II" title="wikilink">Abdul Hamid II</a>. Andranik strongly denounced this cooperation and left the party. In 1908, the ARF asked Andranik to move to Constantinople and nominate his candidacy in the Ottoman parliament election; however, Andranik declined the offer saying &quot;I don't want to sit there and do nothing.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Andranik distanced himself from active political and military affairs for several years.</p>
<h4 id="first-balkan-war">First Balkan War</h4>
<p>In 1907 Andranik settled in <a href="Sofia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sofia</a>, <a href="Bulgaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a>. There he met the leaders of the <a href="Internal_Macedonian_Revolutionary_Organization" title="wikilink">Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization</a>, including revolutionary <a href="Boris_Sarafov" title="wikilink">Boris Sarafov</a>, and the two pledged to work jointly for the oppressed peoples of Armenia and <a href="Macedonia_(region)" title="wikilink">Macedonia</a>. During the <a href="First_Balkan_War" title="wikilink">First Balkan War</a> (1912&lt;U+2013&gt;13), Andranik led a <a href="Company_(military_unit)" title="wikilink">company</a> of some 230 Armenian volunteers within the Bulgarian army against the Ottoman Empire. The volunteer company was part of the <a href="Macedonian-Adrianopolitan_Volunteer_Corps" title="wikilink">Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps</a> of <a href="Aleksandar_Protogerov" title="wikilink">Aleksandar Protogerov</a>. He shared the command with <a href="Garegin_Nzhdeh" title="wikilink">Garegin Nzhdeh</a>. On the opposite side, approximately 8,000 Armenians fought for the Ottoman Empire. Andranik was given the rank of a <a href="first_lieutenant" title="wikilink">first lieutenant</a> by the Bulgarian government. He distinguished himself in several battles, including in the <a href="Battle_of_Merhamli" title="wikilink">Battle of Merhamli</a>, when he helped the Bulgarians to capture Turkish commander Yaver Pasha. Andranik was honored with the <a href="Order_of_Bravery" title="wikilink">Order of Bravery</a> by General Protogerov in 1913. However, Andranik disbanded his men in May 1913, and foreseeing <a href="Second_Balkan_War" title="wikilink">war between Bulgaria and Serbia</a> he &quot;retired to a village near <a href="Varna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Varna</a>, and lived as a farmer until August 1914.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="world-war-i">World War I</h3>
<p><img src="Andranik_Caucasian_Campaign_circa_1914-1916.png" title="fig:Andranik with his men during World War I" alt="Andranik with his men during World War I" width="275" /> With the eruption of <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> in July 1914 between Russia, France and Britain on one side and Germany, the Ottoman Empire and Austria on the other, Andranik left Bulgaria for Russia. He was appointed the commander of the first <a href="Armenian_volunteer_battalion" title="wikilink">Armenian volunteer battalion</a> by the Russian government. From November 1914 to August 1915, Andranik took active part in the <a href="Caucasus_Campaign" title="wikilink">Caucasus Campaign</a> within the <a href="Imperial_Russian_Army" title="wikilink">Imperial Russian Army</a> as the head commander of the first Armenian battalion of about 1,200 volunteers. Andranik's battalion particularly stood out at the <a href="Battle_of_Dilman" title="wikilink">Battle of Dilman</a> in April 1915. By the victory at Dilman, the Russian and Armenian forces under the command of General <a href="Tovmas_Nazarbekian" title="wikilink">Nazarbekov</a>, effectively stopped the Turks from invading the Caucasus via <a href="Iranian_Azerbaijan" title="wikilink">Iranian Azerbaijan</a>.</p>
<p>Through 1915, the <a href="Armenian_Genocide" title="wikilink">Armenian Genocide</a> was underway in the Ottoman Empire. By the end of the war, virtually all Armenians living in their ancestral homeland were either exterminated or forced into exile by the Ottoman government. An estimated 1.5 million Armenians died in the process, ending the over two thousand year Armenian presence in <a href="Western_Armenia" title="wikilink">Western Armenia</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The only major resistance to the Turkish atrocities took place in <a href="Van,_Turkey" title="wikilink">Van</a>. The Turkish army <a href="Siege_of_Van" title="wikilink">besieged the city</a>, but the local Armenians, under the leadership of <a href="Aram_Manukian" title="wikilink">Aram Manukian</a>, successfully kept them out until the Armenian volunteers reached Van, forcing the Turks to retreat. Andranik with his unit entered Van on 19 May 1915. Andranik subsequently helped the Russian army to take control of <a href="&lt;U+00C7&gt;atak_(District),_Van" title="wikilink">Shatakh</a>, <a href="Bah&lt;U+00E7&gt;esaray_(District),_Van" title="wikilink">Moks</a> and <a href="Tatvan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tatvan</a> in the southern shore of <a href="Lake_Van" title="wikilink">Lake Van</a>. During the summer of 1915, the Armenian volunteer units disintegrated and Andranik went to <a href="Tiflis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tiflis</a> to recruit more volunteers and continued the combat in November 1915 until March 1916. With Andranik's support, the city of <a href="Mu&lt;U+015F&gt;" title="wikilink">Mush</a> was captured by Russians in February 1916. In recognition of lieutenant general <a href="Theodore_G._Chernozubov" title="wikilink">Theodore G. Chernozubov</a> the successes of Russian army in numerous locations were significantly associated with the fighting of the first Armenian battalion, headed by Andranik. Chernozubov praised Andranik as a brave and experienced chief, who well understood the combat situation, described him as always at the head of militia, enjoying great prestige among the volunteers.</p>
<p><img src="Andranik_Ozanian_1918.jpg" title="fig:Andranik as the commander of the first Armenian volunteer battalion" alt="Andranik as the commander of the first Armenian volunteer battalion" width="200" /> The situation drastically changed in 1916, when the Russian government ordered the Armenian volunteer units to be demobilized and prohibited any Armenian civic activity. Thus, Andranik resigned as the commander of the first Armenian battalion. Despite the Russian promises made earlier their plan for the region was to make <a href="Turkish_Armenia" title="wikilink">Turkish Armenia</a> its integral part and &quot;possibly repopulate by Russian peasants and <a href="Cossacks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cossacks</a>.&quot; <a href="Richard_Hovannisian" title="wikilink">Richard Hovannisian</a> suggests that because the &quot;Russian armies were in firm control of most of the <a href="Armenian_plateau" title="wikilink">Armenian plateau</a> by the summer of 1916, there was no longer any need to expend niceties upon the Armenians.&quot; According to <a href="Tsatur_Aghayan" title="wikilink">Tsatur Aghayan</a>, Russia &quot;used&quot; the Armenian volunteers for its own interests. Andranik and other Armenian volunteers, disappointed by the Russian policy, left the front in July 1916.</p>
<h4 id="russian-revolution-and-turkish-reoccupation">Russian Revolution and Turkish reoccupation</h4>
<p>The <a href="February_Revolution" title="wikilink">February Revolution</a> was positively accepted by the Armenians since it ended the autocratic rule of <a href="Nicholas_II" title="wikilink">Nicholas II</a>. The <a href="Special_Transcaucasian_Committee" title="wikilink">Special Transcaucasian Committee</a> (known as OZAKOM) was set up in the <a href="South_Caucasus" title="wikilink">South Caucasus</a> by the <a href="Russian_Provisional_Government" title="wikilink">Russian Provisional Government</a>. In April 1917, Andranik initiated the publication of the newspaper <em>Hayastan</em> (Armenia) in <a href="Tiflis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tiflis</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> <a href="Vahan_Totovents" title="wikilink">Vahan Totovents</a> became the editor of this non-partisan, Turkish Armenian-orientated newspaper. Until December 1917, Andranik remained in the <a href="South_Caucasus" title="wikilink">South Caucasus</a> where he sought to help the Armenian refugees from the Ottoman Empire in their search for basic needs. The provisional government decree of 9 May 1917 put Turkish Armenia under civil administration, where Armenians held key positions. About 150,000 local Armenians began to rebuild the devastated Turkish Armenia, however, the Russian army units gradually disintegrated and many soldiers deserted and returned to Russia.</p>
<p>After the <a href="October_Revolution" title="wikilink">October Revolution</a>, the chaotic retreat of the Russian troops from Turkish Armenia escalated. The <a href="Bolshevik_Russia" title="wikilink">Bolshevik-turned Russia</a> and the Ottoman Empire signed the <a href="Armistice_of_Erzincan" title="wikilink">Armistice of Erzincan</a> on 5 December 1917 ending the hostilities. Although the <a href="Sovnarkom" title="wikilink">Soviet Russian government</a> formally acknowledged the <a href="right_of_self-determination" title="wikilink">right of self-determination</a> of the Turkish Armenians in January 1918, on 3 March 1918, Soviet Russia signed the <a href="Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk" title="wikilink">Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</a> with the <a href="Central_Powers" title="wikilink">Central Powers</a>, ceding not only Turkish Armenia, but also large areas in Eastern Europe in order to concentrate its forces against the <a href="White_movement" title="wikilink">Whites</a> in the <a href="Russian_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Russian Civil War</a>.</p>

The area was recaptured by the Turks in the February&lt;U+2013&gt;April 1918." width="300" /> In December 1917, because the Russian divisions were deserting the region <em>en masse</em>, the Russian command authorized the formation of the Armenian Army Corps under the <a href="Transcaucasian_Commissariat" title="wikilink">Transcaucasian Commissariat</a>. The Armenian Army Corps, under the command of <a href="General_Nazabekov" title="wikilink">General Nazabekov</a>, positioned in the front line from Van to <a href="Erzincan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Erzincan</a> (about 20,000 people). Two of its three divisions were made up of Russian Armenians, while Andranik commanded the Turkish (Western) Armenian division. The Georgian forces patrolled the area between Erzincan and the <a href="Black_Sea" title="wikilink">Black Sea</a>. Hovannisian states that the only &quot;several thousand men now defended a 300-mile front formerly secured by a half million Russian regulars.&quot; Since December 1917, Andranik commanded the Armenian forces in <a href="Erzurum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Erzurum</a>. In January 1918, he was appointed commander of the Western Armenian division of the Armenian Army Corps and given the rank of <a href="major-general" class="uri" title="wikilink">major-general</a> by the <a href="Caucasus_Front_(Russian_Republic)" title="wikilink">Caucasus Front</a> command.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Andranik was unable to defend Erzurum for long and the outnumbering Turks captured Erzurum on 12 March 1918, forcing the Armenians to evacuate the city.</p>
<p>While the Transcaucasian delegation and the Turks were holding a <a href="Trebizond_Peace_Conference" title="wikilink">conference in Trebizond</a>, through March and April the Turkish forces &quot;overran the temporary establishment of Armenian rule in Turkish Armenia, extinguishing the hope so recently raised. This was a notable and tragic moment for Turkish Armenians, and for Armenian nationalists altogether: it was the liquidation of Armenian &lt;U+2013&gt; or indeed non-Turkish &lt;U+2013&gt; rule in Western Armenia. With the spring offensive of 1918 the homeland, yerkir&lt;U+00EB&gt;, was taken back by the Turks, and, despite the hopes raised at the Paris peace conference, has remained Turkish to this day.&quot; Hovannisian writes that thus &quot;the battle for Turkish Armenia had been quickly decided; the struggle for Russian Armenia was now at hand.&quot; After the Turks captured Erzurum, the largest city in Turkish Armenia, Andranik retreated through <a href="Kars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kars</a> and passing through <a href="Alexandropol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alexandropol</a> and <a href="Stepanavan" title="wikilink">Jalaloghly</a> arrived in <a href="Dsegh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dsegh</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> By early April 1918, the Turkish forces reached the pre-war international borders.

<h3 id="first-republic-of-armenia">First Republic of Armenia</h3>
<p>Since the Ottoman forces were effectively stopped at Sardarabad, the <a href="Armenian_National_Council_(1917&lt;U+2014&gt;1918)" title="wikilink">Armenian National Council</a> declared the independence of the <a href="Russian_Armenia" title="wikilink">Russian Armenian</a> lands on May 28, 1918. Andranik condemned this move and denounced the <a href="Armenian_Revolutionary_Federation" title="wikilink">Armenian Revolutionary Federation</a>. &quot;Angry&quot; with the Dashnaks, he favored good relations with the Bolshevik Russia instead. Andranik refused to acknowledge the Republic of Armenia, because according to the <a href="Treaty_of_Batum" title="wikilink">Treaty of Batum</a> it &quot;was only a dusty province without Turkish Armenia whose salvation Armenians had been seeking for 40 years.&quot; From early June, Andranik departed from <a href="Dilijan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dilijan</a> with thousands of refugees and through <a href="Sevan,_Armenia" title="wikilink">Yelenovka</a>, <a href="Nor_Bayazet" title="wikilink">Nor Bayazet</a> and <a href="Vayots_Dzor" title="wikilink">Daralagyaz</a> arrived in <a href="Nakhchivan_Autonomous_Republic" title="wikilink">Nakhichevan</a> on June 17.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> He subsequently tried to help the Armenian refugees from <a href="Van,_Turkey" title="wikilink">Van</a> at <a href="Khoy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khoy</a>, Iran.

<h4 id="zangezur">Zangezur</h4>
<p><img src="Andranik_Zangezur_1918.png" title="fig:Andranik with the commanders of the Special Striking Division in Zangezur, 1918" alt="Andranik with the commanders of the Special Striking Division in Zangezur, 1918" width="300" /> As the Turkish forces moved towards Nakhichevan, Andranik with his Armenian Special Striking Division moved up to the mountainous region of <a href="Syunik_Province" title="wikilink">Zangezur</a> to set up a defense.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> By mid-1918, the relations between the Armenians and Azeris in Zangezur had risen high. Andranik arrived in Zangezur at a &quot;critical moment&quot; with around 30,000 refugees and a force of an estimated three to five thousand men. He established an effective control of the region by September. The role of Zangezur was crucial since it was a connection point between Turkey and Azerbaijan. Under Andranik, the region became one of the last centers of Armenian resistance after the Treaty of Batum.</p>
<p>Andranik's irregulars remained in Zangezur surrounded by Muslim villages that controlled the key routes connecting the different parts of Zangezur. According to <a href="Donald_Bloxham" title="wikilink">Donald Bloxham</a>, Andranik initiated the process of transforming Zangezur into a solidly Armenian land by destroying Muslim villages and tried to ethnically homogenize key areas of the Armenian state.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In late 1918, Azerbaijan accused Andranik of massacring innocent Azerbaijani peasants in Zangezur and demanded that he withdraw Armenian units from Zangezur. <a href="Antranig_Chalabian" title="wikilink">Antranig Chalabian</a> suggests that if his Special Striking Division had not been in the area, &quot;the Tartars and the Turks would have exterminated the sixty thousand Armenians of Zangezur&quot;; he further stated that Andranik &quot;did not massacre peaceful Tatars.&quot; Andranik's activities in Zangezur were protested by Ottoman general <a href="Halil_Pasha" title="wikilink">Halil Pasha</a> who threatened the Dashnak government with retaliation for the actions wrought by Andranik. Armenia's Prime Minister <a href="Hovhannes_Katchaznouni" title="wikilink">Hovhannes Katchaznouni</a> rightfully claimed to have no control over Andranik and his forces.</p>
<h4 id="karabakh">Karabakh</h4>
<p>The Ottoman Empire was officially defeated in the First World War and the <a href="Armistice_of_Mudros" title="wikilink">Armistice of Mudros</a> was signed on 30 October 1918. The Ottoman forces evacuated Karabakh in November 1918 and by the end of October of that year, Andranik's forces were concentrated in between Zangezur and Karabakh. Before moving towards Karabakh, Andranik made sure that the local Armenians would support him in fighting the Azeris. In mid-November 1918, he received letters from Karabakh Armenian officials calling him to postpone the offensive for 10 days to negotiate with the Muslims of the region. According to Hovannisian, &quot;the time lost proved crucial.&quot; In late November, Andranik's forces headed towards <a href="Shusha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shusha</a>, the main city of Karabakh and a major Armenian cultural center. After an intense fighting against the Kurds, his forces broke through <a href="Lachin" title="wikilink">Abdallyar</a> and the surrounding villages.</p>
<p>By early December Andranik was some 40 km away from Shusha, when he received a message from British General W. M. Thomson, who was in Baku at the time, suggesting that he retreat from Karabakh &quot;since the World War was over, any further Armenian military activity would adversely affect the solution of the Armenian question, soon to be taken under the consideration by the <a href="Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919" title="wikilink">peace conference in Europe</a>.&quot; Andranik, &quot;trusting the British&quot;, returned to Zangezur, &quot;since all further matters would be solved at the peace conference.&quot;</p>
<p>The region was left under limited control of the Armenian <a href="Karabakh_Council" title="wikilink">Karabakh Council</a>. The British mission under command of Thomson arrived in Karabakh in December 1918. Thomson insisted that the council &quot;act only in local, nonpolitical matters&quot;, which sparked discontent among the Armenians. An &quot;ardent <a href="pan-Turkist" class="uri" title="wikilink">pan-Turkist</a>&quot; <a href="Khosrov_bey_Sultanov" title="wikilink">Khosrov bey Sultanov</a> was soon appointed the governor of Karabagh and Zangezur by Thomson to &quot;squash any unrest in the region.&quot; <a href="Christopher_J._Walker" title="wikilink">Christopher J. Walker</a> suggests that &quot;Karabagh with its large Armenian majority remained Azerbaijani throughout the pre-Soviet and Soviet period&quot; because of &quot;Andranik's trust of the word of a British officer.&quot;</p>
<h4 id="departure">Departure</h4>
<p><img src="Andranik_1919.png" title="fig:Andranik with his men and two archbishops in Etchmiadzin just before leaving Armenia, April 1919" alt="Andranik with his men and two archbishops in Etchmiadzin just before leaving Armenia, April 1919" width="300" /> During the winter of 1918&lt;U+2013&gt;19 Zangezur was isolated from Karabakh and Yerevan by snow. The refugees intensified the famine and epidemic conditions and gave way to inflation. In December 1918, Andranik withdrew from Karabakh to <a href="Goris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Goris</a>. On his way, he met with British officers, who suggested the Armenian units stay in Zangezur for the winter. Andranik agreed. On 23 December 1918, a group of Armenian leaders met in a conference and concluded that Zangezur could not handle the multitude until spring. They agreed that the first logical step in relieving the tension was the reparation of the more than 15,000 refugees whose homes were in Nakhichevan, the adjoining district that had been just evacuated by the Ottoman armies. Both Andranik and the conference called upon the British to provide for the refugees in the interim. Major W. D. Gibbon arrived with limited supplies and money donated by the <a href="Armenians_in_Baku" title="wikilink">Armenians of Baku</a>. However, this wasn't enough to support the refugees.</p>
<p>At the end of February 1919 Andranik was ready to leave Zangezur. British Major Gibbon suggested Andranik and his soldiers leave by Baku-Tiflis railway at <a href="Yevlakh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yevlakh</a> station. Andranik did not accept his plan and on 22 March 1919, he left <a href="Goris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Goris</a> and across <a href="Sisian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sisian</a> through deep snowdrifts to Daralagyaz moved to <a href="Ararat_plain" title="wikilink">Ararat plain</a> with his few thousand irregulars. After a three weeks long march his men and horses reached the railway station of <a href="Ararat,_Armenia" title="wikilink">Davalu</a>. <a href="Drastamat_Kanayan" title="wikilink">Dro</a>, the Assistant Minister of Military Affairs, and Sargis Manasian, the Assistant Minister of Internal Affairs met Andranik and offered to take him to visit Yerevan, but he rejected their invitation as he believed the Dashnak government had betrayed the Armenians and was responsible for the loss of his homeland and the annihilation of his people. Zangezur became more vulnerable for Azerbaijani threats after Andranik left the district. Earlier, before the Andranik's and his soldiers dismissal, the local Armenian forces had requested support from Yerevan. <img src="Andranik_hat.png" title="fig:Andranik wearing his uniform and medals with a papakhi hat." alt="Andranik wearing his uniform and medals with a papakhi hat." width="175" /></p>
<p>On 13 April 1919 Andranik reached <a href="Etchmiadzin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Etchmiadzin</a>, the seat of <a href="Catholicos_of_All_Armenians" title="wikilink">Catholicos of All Armenians</a> and the religious center of the Armenians, &quot;in conjunction with us made preparations for disbanding.&quot; His 5,000-strong division had dwindled to 1,350 soldiers. As a result of disagreements Andranik had with the Dashnak government and the diplomatic machinations of the British in the Caucasus, Andranik disbanded his division and handed over his belongings and weapons to the Catholicos <a href="George_V_of_Armenia" title="wikilink">George V</a>.</p>
<p>On 27 April 1919 he left Etchmiadzin and accompanied by 15 officers went to <a href="Tiflis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tiflis</a> on a special train. &quot;The news of his journey traveled before him. At every station crowds were waiting to get a glimpse of their national hero.&quot; He left Armenia for the last time in his lifetime, never to return. In Tiflis he met with Georgia's Foreign Minister <a href="Evgeni_Gegechkori" title="wikilink">Evgeni Gegechkori</a> and discussed the <a href="Georgian&lt;U+2013&gt;Armenian_War" title="wikilink">Georgian&lt;U+2013&gt;Armenian War</a> with translation of <a href="Hovhannes_Tumanyan" title="wikilink">Hovhannes Tumanyan</a>.</p>

<p>From 1919 to 1922 Andranik wandered in Europe and the United States seeking support for the <a href="Armenian_Genocide_survivors" title="wikilink">Armenian refugees</a>. He visited Paris and London &quot;trying to persuade Allies to occupy Turkish Armenia.&quot; In 1919, during his visit to France, Andranik was bestowed the title of <a href="Legion_of_Honor" title="wikilink">Legion of Honor</a> Officier by President <a href="Raymond_Poincar&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Raymond Poincar&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In late 1919 Andranik led a delegation to the United States to lobby its support for a mandate for Armenia and fund-raising for the Armenian army.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He was accompanied by General Jaques Bagratuni and <a href="Hovhannes_Katchaznouni" title="wikilink">Hovhannes Katchaznouni</a>.
