<p><strong>Ion Victor Antonescu</strong> (June 15, 1882 &lt;U+2013&gt; June 1, 1946) was a <a href="Romania" title="wikilink">Romanian</a> soldier, <a href="Authoritarianism" title="wikilink">authoritarian</a> politician and convicted <a href="War_crime" title="wikilink">war criminal</a>. The <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a> and <em><a href="Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor</a></em> during most of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, he presided over two successive <a href="Romania_during_World_War_II" title="wikilink">wartime dictatorships</a>. A <a href="Romanian_Army" title="wikilink">Romanian Army</a> career officer who made his name during the <a href="1907_Romanian_Peasants&#39;_Revolt" title="wikilink">1907 peasants' revolt</a> and the <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> <a href="Romania_during_World_War_I" title="wikilink">Romanian Campaign</a>, the <a href="Antisemitism" title="wikilink">antisemitic</a> Antonescu sympathized with the <a href="far_right" title="wikilink">far right</a> and <a href="Fascism" title="wikilink">fascist</a> <a href="National_Christian_Party" title="wikilink">National Christian</a> and <a href="Iron_Guard" title="wikilink">Iron Guard</a> groups for much of the <a href="interwar_period" title="wikilink">interwar period</a>. A <a href="military_attach&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">military attach&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> to <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a> and later <a href="Chief_of_the_Romanian_General_Staff" title="wikilink">Chief of the General Staff</a>, he briefly served as <a href="Ministry_of_National_Defense_(Romania)" title="wikilink">Defense Minister</a> in the National Christian cabinet of <a href="Octavian_Goga" title="wikilink">Octavian Goga</a>. During the late 1930s, his political stance brought him into conflict with <a href="King_of_Romania" title="wikilink">King</a> <a href="Carol_II_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Carol II</a> and led to his detainment. Antonescu nevertheless rose to political prominence during the political crisis of 1940, and established the <a href="National_Legionary_State" title="wikilink">National Legionary State</a>, an uneasy partnership with the Iron Guard's leader <a href="Horia_Sima" title="wikilink">Horia Sima</a>. After entering Romania into an alliance with <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi Germany</a> and the <a href="Axis_Powers" title="wikilink">Axis</a> and ensuring <a href="Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Adolf Hitler</a>'s confidence, he eliminated the Guard during the <a href="Legionnaires&#39;_rebellion_and_Bucharest_pogrom" title="wikilink">Legionary Rebellion</a> of 1941. In addition to leadership of the executive, he assumed the offices of <a href="Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Romania)" title="wikilink">Foreign Affairs</a> and Defense Minister. Soon after Romania joined the Axis in <a href="Operation_Barbarossa" title="wikilink">Operation Barbarossa</a>, recovering <a href="Bessarabia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bessarabia</a> and <a href="Northern_Bukovina" title="wikilink">Northern Bukovina</a>, Antonescu also became <a href="Marshal_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Marshal of Romania</a>.</p>
<p>An atypical figure among <a href="Holocaust" class="uri" title="wikilink">Holocaust</a> perpetrators, Antonescu enforced policies independently responsible for the deaths of as many as 400,000 people, most of them <a href="Bessarabian_Jews" title="wikilink">Bessarabian</a>, <a href="History_of_the_Jews_in_Ukraine" title="wikilink">Ukrainian</a> and <a href="History_of_the_Jews_in_Romania" title="wikilink">Romanian Jews</a>, as well as <a href="Roma_minority_in_Romania" title="wikilink">Romani Romanians</a>. The regime's <a href="Holocaust_in_Romania" title="wikilink">complicity in the Holocaust</a> combined <a href="pogrom" title="wikilink">pogroms</a> and <a href="mass_murder" title="wikilink">mass murders</a> such as the <a href="1941_Odessa_massacre" title="wikilink">Odessa massacre</a> with <a href="ethnic_cleansing" title="wikilink">ethnic cleansing</a>, systematic deportations to occupied <a href="Transnistria_(World_War_II)" title="wikilink">Transnistria</a> and widespread <a href="criminal_negligence" title="wikilink">criminal negligence</a>. The system in place was nevertheless characterized by singular inconsistencies, prioritizing plunder over killing, showing leniency toward most Jews in the <a href="Romanian_Old_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Old Kingdom</a>, and ultimately refusing to adopt the <a href="Final_Solution" title="wikilink">Final Solution</a> as applied throughout <a href="Nazi-occupied_Europe" title="wikilink">Nazi-occupied Europe</a>.</p>
<p>Confronted with heavy losses on the <a href="Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)" title="wikilink">Eastern Front</a>, Antonescu embarked on inconclusive negotiations with the <a href="Allies_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">Allies</a>, just before a political coalition, formed around the young monarch <a href="Michael_I_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Michael I</a>, toppled him during the <a href="King_Michael&#39;s_Coup" title="wikilink">August 23, 1944 Coup</a>. After a brief detention in the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>, the deposed <em>Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor</em> was handed back to Romania, where he was tried by a special <a href="Romanian_People&#39;s_Tribunals" title="wikilink">People's Tribunal</a> and executed. This was part of a series of trials, which also passed sentences on his various associates, as well as his wife <a href="Maria_Antonescu" title="wikilink">Maria</a>. The judicial procedures earned much criticism for responding to the <a href="Romanian_Communist_Party" title="wikilink">Romanian Communist Party</a>'s ideological priorities, a matter which fueled <a href="Nationalism" title="wikilink">nationalist</a> and far right attempts to have Antonescu posthumously exonerated. While these groups elevated Antonescu to the status of hero, his involvement in the Holocaust was officially reasserted and condemned following the 2003 <a href="Wiesel_Commission" title="wikilink">Wiesel Commission</a> report.</p>

<p>During the repression of the <a href="1907_Romanian_Peasants&#39;_Revolt" title="wikilink">1907 peasants' revolt</a>, he was the head of a cavalry unit in <a href="Covurlui_County" title="wikilink">Covurlui County</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Opinions on his role in the events diverge: while some historians believe Antonescu was a particularly violent participant in the quelling,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> others equate his participation with that of regular officers<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> or view it as outstandingly tactful.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In addition to restricting peasant protests, Antonescu's unit subdued <a href="Socialism" title="wikilink">socialist</a> activities in <a href="Gala&lt;U+0163&gt;i" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gala&lt;U+0163&gt;i</a> port.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> His handling of the situation earned him praise from <a href="King_of_Romania" title="wikilink">King</a> <a href="Carol_I_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Carol I</a>, who sent Crown Prince (future monarch) <a href="Ferdinand_I_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Ferdinand</a> to congratulate him in front of the whole garrison.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The following year, Antonescu was promoted to Lieutenant, and, between 1911 and 1913, he attended the <a href="Academia_de_&lt;U+00CE&gt;nalte_Studii_Militare_din_Bucure&lt;U+015F&gt;ti" title="wikilink">Advanced War School</a>, receiving the rank of Captain upon graduation.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In 1913, during the <a href="Second_Balkan_War" title="wikilink">Second Balkan War</a> against <a href="Bulgaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a>, Antonescu served as a <a href="Staff_(military)" title="wikilink">staff officer</a> in the First Cavalry Division in <a href="Dobruja" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dobruja</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="world-war-i">World War I</h3>
<p>After 1916, when the <a href="Kingdom_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Romania</a> entered <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> on the <a href="Allies_of_World_War_I" title="wikilink">Entente side</a>, Ion Antonescu acted as <a href="chief_of_staff" title="wikilink">chief of staff</a> for General <a href="Constantin_Prezan" title="wikilink">Constantin Prezan</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> In August 1916, upon the start of the <a href="Romania_during_World_War_I" title="wikilink">Romanian campaign</a>, Romanian troops crossed the <a href="Carpathian_Mountains" title="wikilink">Carpathian Mountains</a>, marching into the <a href="Austria-Hungary" title="wikilink">Austro-Hungarian</a>-ruled region of <a href="Transylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transylvania</a>, but their effort was halted when the <a href="Central_Powers" title="wikilink">Central Powers</a> opened new fronts. Bulgarian and <a href="German_Empire" title="wikilink">Imperial German</a> armies decisively defeated their ill-equipped and poorly-defended Romanian adversaries in the <a href="Battle_of_Turtucaia" title="wikilink">Battle of Turtucaia</a> (August 24), and advanced into Dobruja. When enemy troops crossed the mountains from Transylvania into <a href="Wallachia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wallachia</a>, Antonescu was ordered to design a defense plan for Bucharest.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The Romanian royal court, army and administration were subsequently forced to retreat into <a href="Moldavia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moldavia</a>, the last portion of territory still under Romanian control. Henceforth, he partook in any important decision involving defensive efforts, an unusual promotion which probably complimented his ambition.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In December, as Prezan became the <a href="Chief_of_the_Romanian_General_Staff" title="wikilink">Chief of the General Staff</a>, Antonescu, who was by now a major, was named the head of operations, being involved in the defense of Moldavia. He contributed to the tactics used during the <a href="Battle_of_M&lt;U+0103&gt;r&lt;U+0103&gt;&lt;U+015F&gt;e&lt;U+015F&gt;ti" title="wikilink">Battle of M&lt;U+0103&gt;r&lt;U+0103&gt;&lt;U+015F&gt;e&lt;U+015F&gt;ti</a> (July-August 1917), when Romanians under General <a href="Alexandru_Averescu" title="wikilink">Alexandru Averescu</a> managed to stop the advance of German forces under the command of Field Marshal <a href="August_von_Mackensen" title="wikilink">August von Mackensen</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Antonescu lived in Prezan's proximity for the remainder of the war, and influenced his decisions.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>That autumn, the <a href="Russian_Revolution_of_1917" title="wikilink">October Revolution</a> took place, taking Romania's main ally, the <a href="Russian_Provisional_Government" title="wikilink">Russian Provisional Government</a>, out of the conflict. Its successor, <a href="Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic" title="wikilink">Bolshevik Russia</a> made peace with the Central Powers by the <a href="Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk" title="wikilink">Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</a>, leaving Romania the only enemy of the Central Powers on the <a href="Eastern_Front_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">Eastern Front</a>. In these conditions, the Romanian government signed, and the <a href="Parliament_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Parliament</a> ratified, Romania's own <a href="Treaty_of_Bucharest,_1918" title="wikilink">peace treaty with the Central Powers</a>. Romania broke the treaty later in the year, on grounds that King Ferdinand I had not signed it. During the interval, Antonescu, who viewed the <a href="separate_peace" title="wikilink">separate peace</a> as &quot;the most rational solution&quot;, was assigned command over a cavalry regiment.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The renewed offensive played a part in ensuring the <a href="union_of_Transylvania_with_Romania" title="wikilink">union of Transylvania with Romania</a>. After the war, Antonescu's merits as an operations officer were noticed by among others, politician <a href="Ion_G._Duca" title="wikilink">Ion G. Duca</a>, who wrote that &quot;his intelligence, skill and activity, brought credit on himself and invaluable service to the country&quot;.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Another event occurring late in the war is also credited with having played a major part in Antonescu's life: in 1918, Crown Prince <a href="Carol_II_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Carol</a> (the future King Carol II) eloped and technically <a href="Desertion" title="wikilink">deserted</a> his army posting, to marry the commoner <a href="Zizi_Lambrino" title="wikilink">Zizi Lambrino</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> This outraged Antonescu, who developed enduring contempt for the royal.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Ion Antonescu retained his notoriety during the <a href="interwar_period" title="wikilink">interwar period</a>. He participated in the political campaign to make Romania's gains in Transylvania recognized at the <a href="Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919" title="wikilink">Paris Peace Conference</a> of 1919. His <a href="Nationalism" title="wikilink">nationalist</a> argument about a future state of the <a href="Romanians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romanians</a> was published as the essay <em>Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;nii. Origina , trecutul, sacrificiile &lt;U+015F&gt;i drepturile lor</em> (&quot;The Romanians. Their Origin, Their Past, Their Sacrifices and Their Rights&quot;). The booklet claimed extension of Romanian rule beyond the confines of <a href="Greater_Romania" title="wikilink">Greater Romania</a>, and recommended, at the risk of war with the emerging <a href="Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a>, the annexation of all <a href="Banat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Banat</a> areas and the <a href="Timo&lt;U+010D&gt;ka_Krajina" title="wikilink">Timok Valley</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In March 1920, Antonescu was one of three people nominated by the new Averescu executive to be a <a href="military_attach&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">military attach&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> of Romania in <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, but a report issued by the French military observer in Romania, General <a href="Victor_P&lt;U+00E9&gt;tin" title="wikilink">Victor P&lt;U+00E9&gt;tin</a>, was negative enough to make the French side choose a certain Colonel &lt;U+015E&gt;u&lt;U+0163&gt;u instead (the text referred to Antonescu as &quot;extremely vain&quot;, &quot;<a href="Chauvinism" title="wikilink">chauvinistic</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Xenophobia" title="wikilink">xenophobic</a>&quot;, while acknowledging his &quot;great military worth&quot;).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, in 1922, &lt;U+015E&gt;u&lt;U+0163&gt;u had to leave <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a>, and when the Romanian government nominated Antonescu again, the French government felt obliged to accept his nomination, despite renewed criticism from P&lt;U+00E9&gt;tin's part.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> At the moment of his reassignment, Antonescu was handling military instruction in the Transylvanian city of <a href="Sibiu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sibiu</a>, where his rebellious attitude was causing irritation among his commanders.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> From 1923, Antonescu was also the Romanian attach&lt;U+00E9&gt; in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> After embarking on his mission, he negotiated a credit worth 100 million <a href="French_franc" title="wikilink">French francs</a> to be placed in Romania's purchase of French weaponry, and worked together with Romanian <a href="League_of_Nations" title="wikilink">League of Nations</a> diplomat <a href="Nicolae_Titulescu" title="wikilink">Nicolae Titulescu</a>, whose personal friend he became.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> According to one account, he was also in contact with the Romanian-born <a href="Conservatism" title="wikilink">conservative</a> aristocrat and writer <a href="Marthe_Bibesco" title="wikilink">Marthe Bibesco</a>, who is reported to have introduced Antonescu to the ideas of <a href="Gustave_Le_Bon" title="wikilink">Gustave Le Bon</a>, a researcher of <a href="crowd_psychology" title="wikilink">crowd psychology</a> who had an influence on <a href="Fascism" title="wikilink">fascist</a> leaders.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The same story has it that Bibesco saw the Romanian officer as a new version of 19th century nationalist rebel <a href="Georges_Boulanger" title="wikilink">Georges Boulanger</a>, introducing him as such to Le Bon.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> In 1923, he made the acquaintance of lawyer <a href="Mihai_Antonescu" title="wikilink">Mihai Antonescu</a>, who was to become his close friend, legal representative and political associate.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>After returning to Romania in 1926, Antonescu returned to his teaching position in Sibiu, and, in autumn 1928, was Secretary-General of the <a href="Ministry_of_National_Defense_(Romania)" title="wikilink">Defense Ministry</a> in the <a href="Vintil&lt;U+0103&gt;_Br&lt;U+0103&gt;tianu" title="wikilink">Vintil&lt;U+0103&gt; Br&lt;U+0103&gt;tianu</a> cabinet.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> He married <a href="Maria_Antonescu" title="wikilink">Maria Niculescu</a>, for long a resident of France, who had been married twice before: to a <a href="Romanian_Police" title="wikilink">Romanian Police</a> officer, with whom she had a son, Gheorghe (died 1944), and to Frenchman of Jewish origin.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> After a period as Deputy Chief of the General Staff,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> he was appointed its Chief (1933-1934).

<p>As Chief of Staff, Antonescu reportedly had his first confrontation with the political class and the monarch.

<p>In late 1937, after the <a href="Romanian_general_election,_1937" title="wikilink">December general election</a> came to an inconclusive result, Carol appointed Goga <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a> over a far right cabinet meant to curb Codreanu's rise, which was also the first executive to impose <a href="racial_discrimination" title="wikilink">racial discrimination</a> in its treatment of the <a href="History_of_the_Jews_in_Romania" title="wikilink">Jewish community</a>. Initially designated the <a href="Ministry_of_Communications_and_Information_Society_(Romania)" title="wikilink">Communications portfolio</a> by his former rival, Interior Minister Armand C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu, Antonescu repeatedly demanded the office of Defense Minister, which he was eventually granted.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> His mandate coincided with a troubled period, and saw Romania having to chose between its traditional alliance with France, Britain, the crumbling <a href="Little_Entente" title="wikilink">Little Entente</a> and the League of Nations or moving closer to <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi Germany</a> and its <a href="Anti-Comintern_Pact" title="wikilink">Anti-Comintern Pact</a>. Antonescu's own contribution is disputed by historians, who see him as either an Anglo-French alliance supporter or, like the PNC itself, more favorable to cooperation with <a href="Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Adolf Hitler</a>'s Germany.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> At the time, Antonescu viewed Romania's alliance with the Entente core as insurance against Hungarian and <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet</a> <a href="revanchism" class="uri" title="wikilink">revanchism</a>, but, as an <a href="Anti-communism" title="wikilink">anti-communist</a>, he was suspicious of the <a href="Franco-Soviet_Treaty_of_Mutual_Assistance" title="wikilink">Franco-Soviet rapprochement</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Particularly concerned about Hungarian demands in Transylvania, he ordered the General Staff to prepare for a western attack.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> However, his major contribution in office was in relation to an internal crisis: Antonescu extended the already imposed <a href="martial_law" title="wikilink">martial law</a> as a response to violent clashes between the Iron Guard and the PNC's own fascist militia, the <em><a href="L&lt;U+0103&gt;ncieri" class="uri" title="wikilink">L&lt;U+0103&gt;ncieri</a></em>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>The Goga cabinet ended when the tentative rapprochement between Goga and Codreanu<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> prompted Carol to overthrow the democratic system and proclaim his own authoritarian regime (<em>see <a href="1938_Constitution_of_Romania" title="wikilink">1938 Constitution of Romania</a>, <a href="National_Renaissance_Front" title="wikilink">National Renaissance Front</a></em>).

<p>Soon afterward, C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu, acting on indications from the monarch, arrested Codreanu and prosecuted him in two successive trials.

<p><em>Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor</em> Antonescu thought Hitler willing to revise his stance on Northern Transylvania, and claimed to have obtained the German leader's agreement, using it to justify participation on the <a href="Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)" title="wikilink">Eastern Front</a> after the recovery of Bessarabia.<a href="#fn305" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref305"><sup>305</sup></a><a href="#fn306" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref306"><sup>306</sup></a> However, transcripts of the Hitler-Antonescu conversations do not validate his interpretation.<a href="#fn307" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref307"><sup>307</sup></a><a href="#fn308" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref308"><sup>308</sup></a> Another version has it that Hitler sent Antonescu a letter informing him that Bessarabia's political status was ultimately depending on German decisions.<a href="#fn309" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref309"><sup>309</sup></a> In one of his letters to Hitler, Antonescu himself stated an <a href="Anti-communism" title="wikilink">anti-communist</a> ideological motivation: &quot;I confirm that I will pursue operations in the east to the end against that great enemy of civilization, of Europe, and of my country: <a href="Russia" title="wikilink">Russian</a> <a href="Bolshevik" title="wikilink">Bolshevism</a> [...] I will not be swayed by anyone not to extend this military cooperation into new territory.&quot;<a href="#fn310" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref310"><sup>310</sup></a> Antonescu's ideological perspective blended national sentiment with generically <a href="Christianity" title="wikilink">Christian</a> and particularly <a href="Romanian_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Romanian Orthodox</a> traits.

<p>Ion Antonescu and his subordinates were for long divided on the issue of the <a href="Final_Solution" title="wikilink">Final Solution</a>, as applied in territories under direct Nazi control from 1941. At an early stage, German attempts to impose the <a href="RSHA" class="uri" title="wikilink">RSHA</a>'s direct control over Old Kingdom Jews drew some objections from Mihai Antonescu, but the two sides agreed to a common policy in respect to Soviet Jews.<a href="#fn548" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref548"><sup>548</sup></a> In various of his early 1940s statements, Ion Antonescu favorably mentions the Axis goal of eliminating the Jewish presence in the event of victory.<a href="#fn549" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref549"><sup>549</sup></a> The unrestrained character of some Romanian measures in respect to the Jews alarmed Nazi officials, who demanded a methodical form of extermination.<a href="#fn550" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref550"><sup>550</sup></a> When confronted with German decisions to push back Jews he had expelled before the occupation of Transnistria, Antonescu protested, arguing that he had conformed with Hitler's decisions regarding &quot;eastern Jews&quot;.<a href="#fn551" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref551"><sup>551</sup></a> In August 1941, in preparation for the Final Solution's universal application, Hitler remarked: &quot;As for the Jewish question, today in any case one could say that a man like Antonescu, for example, proceeds much more radically in this manner than we have done until now.

<p>Beyond their propaganda and censorship efforts, Antonescu and his regime had a sizable impact on <a href="Culture_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Romanian culture</a>, <a href="Art_of_Romania" title="wikilink">art</a> and <a href="Literature_of_Romania" title="wikilink">literature</a>.

<li id="fn353">According to Achim (p.167-170, 179, 182-183, 185) and Deletant (p.189-190), the measures reflected Antonescu's views on &quot;social problems&quot; more than a racist perspective. However, Kelso (p.99-100) believes the report was a notable factor in the decision to deport the Romani people.<a href="#fnref353" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
