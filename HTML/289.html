Its history begins with the events of 5 November 1605, when <a href="Guy_Fawkes" title="wikilink">Guy Fawkes</a>, a member of the <a href="Gunpowder_Plot" title="wikilink">Gunpowder Plot</a>, was caught guarding explosives placed beneath the <a href="House_of_Lords" title="wikilink">House of Lords</a> and arrested. Celebrating the fact that <a href="James_I_of_England" title="wikilink">King James I</a> had survived the attempt on his life, people lit bonfires around London, and months later the introduction of the <a href="Observance_of_5th_November_Act_1605" title="wikilink">Observance of 5th November Act</a> enforced an annual public day of thanksgiving for the plot's failure.</p>
<p>Within a few decades Gunpowder Treason Day, as it was known, became the predominant English state commemoration, but as it carried strong religious overtones it also became a focus for anti-Catholic sentiment. <a href="Puritans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Puritans</a> delivered sermons regarding the perceived dangers of <a href="popery" class="uri" title="wikilink">popery</a>, while during increasingly raucous celebrations common folk burnt <a href="effigy" title="wikilink">effigies</a> of popular hate-figures, such as the <a href="pope" class="uri" title="wikilink">pope</a>. Towards the end of the 18th century reports appear of children begging for money with effigies of Guy Fawkes and 5 November gradually became known as Guy Fawkes Day. Towns such as <a href="Lewes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lewes</a> and <a href="Guildford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guildford</a> were in the 19th century scenes of increasingly violent class-based confrontations, fostering traditions those towns celebrate still, albeit peaceably. In the 1850s changing attitudes eventually resulted in the toning down of much of the day's anti-Catholic rhetoric, and in 1859 the original 1606 legislation was repealed. Eventually, the violence was dealt with, and by the 20th century Guy Fawkes Day had become an enjoyable social commemoration, although lacking much of its original focus. The present-day Guy Fawkes Night is usually celebrated at large organised events, centred around a bonfire and extravagant firework displays.</p>

<p>Settlers exported Guy Fawkes Night to overseas colonies, including some in North America, where it was known as Pope Day. Those festivities died out with the onset of the <a href="American_Revolution" title="wikilink">American Revolution</a>, although celebrations continue in some <a href="Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="wikilink">Commonwealth</a> nations. Claims that Guy Fawkes Night was a Protestant replacement for older customs like <a href="Samhain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samhain</a> are disputed, although another old celebration, <a href="Halloween" class="uri" title="wikilink">Halloween</a>, has lately increased in popularity, and according to some writers, may threaten the continued observance of 5 November.</p>

In the immediate aftermath of the arrest of <a href="Guy_Fawkes" title="wikilink">Guy Fawkes</a>, caught guarding a cache of explosives placed beneath the <a href="House_of_Lords" title="wikilink">House of Lords</a>, James's Council allowed the public to celebrate the king's survival with bonfires, so long as they were &quot;without any danger or disorder&quot;,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> making 1605 the first year the plot's failure was celebrated.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Days before the surviving conspirators were executed in January 1606, Parliament passed the <a href="Observance_of_5th_November_Act_1605" title="wikilink">Observance of 5th November Act 1605</a>, commonly known as the &quot;Thanksgiving Act&quot;. It was proposed by a Puritan Member of Parliament, <a href="Edward_Montagu,_1st_Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton" title="wikilink">Edward Montagu</a>, who suggested that the king's apparent deliverance by divine intervention deserved some measure of official recognition, and kept 5 November free as a day of thanksgiving while in theory making attendance at Church mandatory.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> A new form of service was also added to the <a href="Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Church of England</a>'s <a href="Book_of_Common_Prayer" title="wikilink">Book of Common Prayer</a>, for use on 5 November.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

Even less is known of how the occasion was first commemorated by the general public, although records indicate that in Protestant <a href="Dorchester,_Dorset" title="wikilink">Dorchester</a> a sermon was read, the church bells rung, and bonfires and fireworks lit.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>According to historian and author <a href="Antonia_Fraser" title="wikilink">Antonia Fraser</a>, a study of the earliest sermons preached demonstrates an anti-Catholic concentration &quot;mystical in its fervour&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Delivering one of five 5 November sermons printed in <em>A Mappe of Rome</em> in 1612, <a href="Thomas_Taylor_(clergyman)" title="wikilink">Thomas Taylor</a> spoke of the &quot;generality of his [a papist's] cruelty,&quot; which had been &quot;almost without bounds&quot;.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Such messages were also spread in printed works like Francis Herring's <em>Pietas Pontifica</em> (republished in 1610 as <em>Popish Piety</em>), and John Rhode's <em>A Brief Summe of the Treason intended against the King &amp; State</em>, which in 1606 sought to educate &quot;the simple and ignorant ... that they be not seduced any longer by papists&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> By the 1620s 5 November was honoured in market towns and villages across the country, though it was some years before it was commemorated throughout England. Gunpowder Treason Day, as it was then known, became the predominant English state commemoration. Some parishes made the day a festive occasion, with public drinking and solemn processions. Concerned though about James's pro-Spanish foreign policy, the decline of international Protestantism, and Catholicism in general, Protestant clergymen who recognised the day's significance called for more dignified and profound thanksgivings each 5 November.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>What unity English Protestants had shared in 1606 began to fade when in 1625 James's son, the future <a href="Charles_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles I</a>, married the Catholic <a href="Henrietta_Maria_of_France" title="wikilink">Henrietta Maria of France</a>. Puritans reacted to the marriage by issuing a new prayer to warn against rebellion and Catholicism, and on 5 November that year, effigies of the pope and the devil were burnt, the earliest such report of this practice and the beginning of centuries of tradition. {{#tag:ref|Nationally, effigies of Fawkes were subsequently joined by those of contemporary hate figures such as the pope, the <a href="sultan_of_Turkey" title="wikilink">sultan of Turkey</a>, the <a href="tsar_of_Russia" title="wikilink">tsar of Russia</a> and the Irish leader <a href="Charles_Stewart_Parnell" title="wikilink">Charles Stewart Parnell</a>. In 1899 an effigy of the <a href="South_African_Republic" title="wikilink">South African Republic</a> leader <a href="Paul_Kruger" title="wikilink">Paul Kruger</a> was burnt at <a href="Ticehurst" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ticehurst</a>, and during the 20th century effigies of militant <a href="suffragist" title="wikilink">suffragists</a>, <a href="Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor" title="wikilink">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a>, <a href="Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Adolf Hitler</a>, <a href="Margaret_Thatcher" title="wikilink">Margaret Thatcher</a> and <a href="John_Major" title="wikilink">John Major</a> were similarly burnt.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> During Charles's reign Gunpowder Treason Day became increasingly partisan.

By 1636, under the leadership of the Arminian Archbishop of Canterbury <a href="William_Laud" title="wikilink">William Laud</a>, the English church was trying to use 5 November to denounce all seditious practices, and not just popery.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Puritans went on the defensive, some pressing for further <a href="Protestant_Reformation" title="wikilink">reformation</a> of the Church.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Lewes_photograph_by_heather_buckley_from_flickr.jpg" title="fig:Revellers in Lewes, 5 November 2010" alt="Revellers in Lewes, 5 November 2010" /> Bonfire Night, as it was occasionally known,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> assumed a new fervour during the events leading up to the <a href="English_Interregnum" title="wikilink">English Interregnum</a>. Although <a href="Cavalier" title="wikilink">Royalists</a> disputed their interpretations, <a href="Roundheads" title="wikilink">Parliamentarians</a> began to uncover or fear new Catholic plots. Preaching before the House of Commons on 5 November 1644, <a href="Charles_Herle" title="wikilink">Charles Herle</a> claimed that Papists were tunnelling &quot;from Oxford, Rome, Hell, to Westminster, and there to blow up, if possible, the better foundations of your houses, their liberties and privileges&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> A display in 1647 at <a href="Lincoln&#39;s_Inn_Fields" title="wikilink">Lincoln's Inn Fields</a> commemorated &quot;God's great mercy in delivering this kingdom from the hellish plots of papists&quot;, and included fireballs burning in the water (symbolising a Catholic association with &quot;infernal spirits&quot;) and fireboxes, their many rockets suggestive of &quot;popish spirits coming from below&quot; to enact plots against the king. Effigies of Fawkes and the pope were present, the latter represented by <a href="Pluto_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Pluto</a>, Greek god of the underworld.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Following Charles I's execution in 1649, the country's new republican regime remained undecided on how to treat 5 November. Unlike the old system of religious feasts and State anniversaries, it survived, but as a celebration of parliamentary government and Protestantism, and not of monarchy.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Commonly the day was still marked by bonfires and miniature explosives, but formal celebrations resumed only with the <a href="Restoration_(England)" title="wikilink">Restoration</a>, when <a href="Charles_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles II</a> became king. Courtiers, <a href="High_Church" title="wikilink">High Anglicans</a> and <a href="Tories" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tories</a> followed the official line, that the event marked God's preservation of the English throne, but generally the celebrations became more diverse. By 1670 London apprentices had turned 5 November into a fire festival, attacking not only popery but also &quot;sobriety and good order&quot;,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> demanding money from coach occupants for alcohol and bonfires. The burning of effigies, largely unknown to the <a href="Jacobean_era" title="wikilink">Jacobeans</a>,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> continued in 1673 when Charles's brother, the <a href="James_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Duke of York</a>, converted to Catholicism. In response, accompanied by a procession of about 1,000 people, the apprentices fired an effigy of the <a href="Whore_of_Babylon" title="wikilink">Whore of Babylon</a>, bedecked with a range of papal symbols.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Similar scenes occurred over the following few years. In 1677 elements of <a href="Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Queen Elizabeth</a>'s <a href="Accession_Day_tilt" title="wikilink">Accession Day celebration</a> of 17 November were incorporated into the Fifth, with the burning of large bonfires, a large effigy of the pope&lt;U+2014&gt;his belly filled with live cats &quot;who squalled most hideously as soon as they felt the fire&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;and two effigies of devils &quot;whispering in his ear&quot;. Two years later, as the <a href="Exclusion_Bill" title="wikilink">exclusion crisis</a> was reaching its zenith, an observer noted the &quot;many bonfires and burning of popes as has ever been seen&quot;. Violent scenes in 1682 forced London's militia into action, and to prevent any repetition the following year a proclamation was issued, banning bonfires and fireworks.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Fireworks were also banned under <a href="James_II_of_England" title="wikilink">James II</a>, who became king in 1685. Attempts by the government to tone down Gunpowder Treason Day celebrations were, however, largely unsuccessful, and some reacted to a ban on bonfires in London (born from a fear of more burnings of the pope's effigy) by placing candles in their windows, &quot;as a witness against Catholicism&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> When James was deposed in 1688 by <a href="William_III_of_England" title="wikilink">William of Orange</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;who importantly, landed in England on 5 November&lt;U+2014&gt;the day's events turned also to the celebration of freedom and religion, with elements of anti-<a href="Jacobitism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jacobitism</a>.

<p>William's birthday fell on 4 November, and for orthodox <a href="Whig_(British_political_party)" title="wikilink">Whigs</a> the two days therefore became an important double anniversary.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He ordered that the thanksgiving service for 5 November be amended to include thanks for his &quot;happy arrival&quot; and &quot;the Deliverance of our Church and Nation&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> As one of 49 official holidays, for the ruling class, 5 November became overshadowed by events such as the birthdays of <a href="Admiral" class="uri" title="wikilink">Admiral</a> <a href="Edward_Vernon" title="wikilink">Edward Vernon</a>, or <a href="John_Wilkes" title="wikilink">John Wilkes</a>, and under <a href="George_II_of_England" title="wikilink">George II</a> and <a href="George_III_of_England" title="wikilink">George III</a>, with the exception of the <a href="Jacobite_Rising_of_1745" title="wikilink">Jacobite Rising of 1745</a>, it was largely &quot;a polite entertainment rather than an occasion for vitriolic thanksgiving&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> For the lower classes, however, the anniversary was a chance to pit disorder against order, a pretext for violence and uncontrolled revelry. This theme continued into the 19th century, with reports in <a href="Lewes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lewes</a> of annual rioting, intimidation of &quot;respectable householders&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> and the rolling through the streets of lit tar barrels. In <a href="Guildford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guildford</a>, gangs of revellers who called themselves &quot;guys&quot; terrorised the local population; proceedings were concerned more with the settling of old arguments and general mayhem, than any historical reminiscences.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Similar problems arose in <a href="Exeter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Exeter</a>, originally the scene of more traditional celebrations.

This sketch is from an issue of Punch, printed in November that year." /> At some point in the 18th century and for reasons that are unclear, it became customary to burn Guy Fawkes in effigy, rather than the pope. Gradually, Gunpowder Treason Day had turned into Guy Fawkes Day. In 1790 <em>The Times</em> reported instances of children &quot;...begging for money for Guy Faux&quot;,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and a report of 4 November 1802 described how &quot;a set of idle fellows ... with some horrid figure dressed up as a <em>Guy Faux</em>&quot; were convicted of begging and receiving money, and committed to prison as &quot;idle and disorderly persons&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The Fifth had become &quot;a polysemous occasion, replete with polyvalent cross-referencing, meaning all things to all men&quot;.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>On several occasions during the 19th century <em><a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">The Times</a></em> reported that the tradition was in decline, being &quot;of late years almost forgotten&quot;, but in the opinion of historian David Cressy, such reports reflected &quot;other Victorian trends&quot; and not general observance of the Fifth.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Civil unrest brought about by the union of the Kingdoms of <a href="Kingdom_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Great Britain</a> and <a href="Kingdom_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> in 1800 resulted in Parliament passing the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Relief_Act_1829" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829</a>, which afforded Catholics greater civil rights, continuing the process of <a href="Catholic_Emancipation" title="wikilink">Catholic Emancipation</a> in the two kingdoms.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The traditional denunciations of Catholicism had been in decline since the early 18th century,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> and were thought by many, including <a href="Queen_Victoria" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a>, to be outdated,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> but the pope's <a href="Universalis_Ecclesiae" title="wikilink">restoration in 1850</a> of the English Catholic hierarchy gave renewed significance to 5 November, as demonstrated by the burnings of effigies of the new Catholic Archbishop of Westminster <a href="Nicholas_Wiseman" title="wikilink">Nicholas Wiseman</a>, and the pope. At <a href="Farringdon_Market" title="wikilink">Farringdon Market</a> 14 effigies were processed from the <a href="Strand,_London" title="wikilink">Strand</a> and over <a href="Westminster_Bridge" title="wikilink">Westminster Bridge</a> to <a href="Southwark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Southwark</a>, while extensive demonstrations were held throughout the suburbs of London.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Effigies of the twelve new English Catholic bishops were paraded through Exeter, already the scene of severe public disorder on each anniversary of the Fifth.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Gradually, however, such scenes became less popular. The thanksgiving prayer of 5 November contained in the Anglican <a href="Book_of_Common_Prayer" title="wikilink">Book of Common Prayer</a> was abolished, with little resistance in Parliament, and in March 1859 the <a href="Anniversary_Days_Observance_Act_1859" title="wikilink">Anniversary Days Observance Act</a> repealed the original 1606 Act.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> As the authorities dealt with the worst excesses, public decorum was gradually restored.

<p><img src="Spectators_watching_fireworks_display_from_Flickr_user_KSDigital.jpg" title="fig:A fireworks display on 5 November 2010" alt="A fireworks display on 5 November 2010" /> Historians have often suggested that Guy Fawkes Day served as a Protestant replacement for the ancient <a href="Celts" title="wikilink">Celtic</a> and <a href="Nordic_countries" title="wikilink">Nordic</a> festivals of <a href="Samhain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samhain</a>, <a href="pagan" class="uri" title="wikilink">pagan</a> events that the church absorbed and transformed into <a href="All_Hallow&#39;s_Eve" title="wikilink">All Hallow's Eve</a> and <a href="All_Souls&#39;_Day" title="wikilink">All Souls' Day</a>. In <em><a href="The_Golden_Bough" title="wikilink">The Golden Bough</a></em>, the Scottish anthropologist <a href="James_George_Frazer" title="wikilink">James George Frazer</a> suggested that Guy Fawkes Day exemplifies &quot;the recrudescence of old customs in modern shapes&quot;. <a href="David_Underdown" title="wikilink">David Underdown</a>, writing in his 1987 work <em>Revel, Riot, and Rebellion</em>, viewed Gunpowder Treason Day as a replacement for Hallowe'en: &quot;just as the early church had taken over many of the pagan feasts, so did Protestants acquire their own rituals, adapting older forms or providing substitutes for them&quot;.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> While the use of bonfires to mark the occasion was most likely taken from the ancient practice of lighting celebratory bonfires, the idea that the commemoration of 5 November 1605 ever originated from anything other than the safety of James I is, according to David Cressy, &quot;speculative nonsense&quot;.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Citing Cressy's work, <a href="Ronald_Hutton" title="wikilink">Ronald Hutton</a> agrees with his conclusion, writing, &quot;There is, in brief, nothing to link the Hallowe'en fires of North Wales, Man, and central Scotland with those which appeared in England upon 5 November.&quot;<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Further confusion arises in <a href="Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland</a>, where some communities celebrate Guy Fawkes Night; the distinction there between the Fifth, and Halloween, is not always clear.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Despite such disagreements, in 2005 <a href="David_Cannadine" title="wikilink">David Cannadine</a> commented on the encroachment into British culture of late 20th-century American Hallowe'en celebrations, and their effect on Guy Fawkes Night:</p>

<p>Another celebration involving fireworks, the five-day <a href="Hindu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hindu</a> festival of <a href="Diwali" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diwali</a> (normally observed between mid-October and November), in 2010 began on 5 November. This led <em><a href="The_Independent" title="wikilink">The Independent</a></em> to comment on the similarities between the two, its reporter Kevin Rawlinson wondering &quot;which fireworks will burn brightest&quot;.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="South_end_forever_North_end_forever.jpg" title="fig:1768 colonial commemoration of 5 November 1605" alt="1768 colonial commemoration of 5 November 1605" /> Gunpowder Treason Day was exported by settlers to colonies around the world.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Although initially the commemoration was paid scant attention, the arrest of two boys caught lighting bonfires on 5 November 1662 in <a href="Boston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boston</a> suggests, in historian James Sharpe's view, that &quot;an underground tradition of commemorating the Fifth existed&quot;.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> In parts of North America it was known as Pope Day, celebrated mainly in colonial <a href="History_of_New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a>, but also as far south as <a href="History_of_Charleston,_South_Carolina" title="wikilink">Charleston</a>. In Boston, founded in 1630 by Puritan settlers led by <a href="John_Winthrop" title="wikilink">John Winthrop</a>, an early celebration was held in 1685, the same year that James II assumed the throne. Fifty years later , again in Boston, a local minister wrote &quot;a Great number of people went over to Dorchester neck where at night they made a Great Bonfire and plaid off many fireworks&quot;, although the day ended in tragedy when &quot;4 young men coming home in a Canoe were all Drowned.&quot; Ten years later the raucous celebrations were the cause of considerable annoyance to the upper classes and a special Riot Act was passed, to prevent &quot;riotous tumultuous and disorderly assemblies of more than three persons, all or any of them armed with Sticks, Clubs or and kind of weapons, or disguised with vizards, or painted or discolored faces, on in any manner disgused, having any kind of imagery or pageantry, in any street, lane, or place in Boston.&quot; With inadequate resources, however, Boston's authorities were powerless to enforce the Act. In the 1740s gang violence became common, with groups of Boston residents battling for the honour of burning the pope's effigy. By the mid-1760s the riots had subsided, and as colonial America moved towards <a href="American_Revolution" title="wikilink">revolution</a>, the class rivalries featured during Pope Day gave way to anti-British sentiment.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>The passage in 1774 of the <a href="Quebec_Act" title="wikilink">Quebec Act</a>, which guaranteed French Canadians free practice of Catholicism in the <a href="Province_of_Quebec_(1763&lt;U+2013&gt;1791)" title="wikilink">Province of Quebec</a>, provoked complaints from some Americans that the British were introducing &quot;Popish principles and French law&quot; to Quebec.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> These fears were bolstered by the opposition from the Church in Europe to American independence, threatening a revival of Pope Day.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Commenting in 1775, <a href="George_Washington" title="wikilink">George Washington</a> was less than impressed by the thought of any such resurrections, forbidding any under his command from participating:<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>Generally, following Washington's complaint, American colonists stopped observing Pope Day, although according to <a href="The_Bostonian_Society" title="wikilink">The Bostonian Society</a> some citizens of Boston celebrated it on one final occasion, in 1776.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The tradition continued in <a href="Salem,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Salem</a> as late as 1817,<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> and was still observed in <a href="Portsmouth,_New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">Portsmouth, New Hampshire</a>, in 1892.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> In the late 18th century, effigies of prominent figures such as two <a href="Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Prime Ministers</a> of Great Britain, the <a href="John_Stuart,_3rd_Earl_of_Bute" title="wikilink">Earl of Bute</a> and <a href="Frederick_North,_Lord_North" title="wikilink">Lord North</a>, and the American traitor General <a href="Benedict_Arnold" title="wikilink">Benedict Arnold</a>, were also burnt.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> In the 1880s bonfires were still being burnt in some New England coastal towns, although no longer to commemorate the failure of the Gunpowder Plot. In the area around <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York</a>, stacks of barrels were burnt on <a href="Election_Day_(United_States)" title="wikilink">election day</a> eve, which after 1845 was a Tuesday early in November.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
