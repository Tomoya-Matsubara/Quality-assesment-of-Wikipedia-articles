<p>The <strong>1901 Louisiana hurricane</strong> was the first hurricane to make <a href="Landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">landfall</a> in <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a> in the month of August or earlier since <a href="1888_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">1888</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The fourth <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclone</a> and second hurricane of the <a href="1901_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">season</a>, this storm developed southwest of the <a href="Azores" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azores</a> on August 2. Moving southwestward and later westward, the depression remained weak for several days, until strengthening into a tropical storm while approaching the <a href="Bahamas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahamas</a> early on August 9. It then crossed through the islands and intensified only slightly. Late on August 10, the storm made landfall near <a href="Deerfield_Beach,_Florida" title="wikilink">Deerfield Beach, Florida</a>.
