<p>Maggie Horton is one of the best known characters invented by one of the original writers of <em>Days of our Lives</em>, <a href="William_J._Bell" title="wikilink">William J. Bell</a> (March 6, 1927 &lt;U+2013&gt; April 29, 2005)<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He created the character of Maggie, as a <a href="romantic" class="uri" title="wikilink">romantic</a> <a href="interest" class="uri" title="wikilink">interest</a>, for original character <a href="Mickey_Horton" title="wikilink">Mickey Horton</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The character however would become a much bigger part of the show in later years.

Maggie's parents were initially killed in a car accident, which also leaves her crippled. Maggie is alone in the world, her parents are killed, but when Mickey arrives she meets the love she's been missing.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></big></p>
<h2 id="casting">Casting</h2>
<p>From the beginning, Bell considered the role ideal for <a href="Suzanne_Rogers" title="wikilink">Suzanne Rogers</a>, a former rocket. Bell approached Rogers about taking the role of Maggie, and she agreed.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> She was described as being one of the most <a href="energetic" class="uri" title="wikilink">energetic</a> girls on <a href="Daytime" class="uri" title="wikilink">Daytime</a>. Known for her famous red hair, and freckles she was training to become a dancer. The news of <a href="Suzanne_Rogers" title="wikilink">Suzanne Rogers</a> being cast as Maggie was a typical move. Taking an actress who loves to <a href="dance" class="uri" title="wikilink">dance</a>, and her character being a <a href="crippled" class="uri" title="wikilink">crippled</a> <a href="farm" class="uri" title="wikilink">farm</a> <a href="girl" class="uri" title="wikilink">girl</a>.

They changed their decision knowing Rogers to be a former Rochette, and provided her with crutches. Althought getting around was not easy, she pulled it off for her first year on screen as <a href="Maggie_Horton" title="wikilink">Maggie Horton</a>. The character was originally supposed to be short lived, however popularity with on screen pairing with <a href="Mickey_Horton" title="wikilink">Mickey Horton</a> proved to be a different story.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
