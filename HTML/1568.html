<p><strong><em>Ex parte Crow Dog</em></strong>, <a href="Case_citation" title="wikilink">109 U.S. 556</a> (1883), was a case that involved a conflict between two members of the same <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native American</a> tribe on <a href="Indian_reservation" title="wikilink">reservation</a> land where one, <a href="Crow_Dog" title="wikilink">Crow Dog</a>, killed the other. The <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Supreme Court of the United States</a> held that a federal court did not have jurisdiction to try Crow Dog, a member of the <a href="Brul&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brul&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> band of the <a href="Lakota_people" title="wikilink">Lakota</a> Sioux, when the offense had already been tried by the tribal council. The tribe handled the case according to <a href="Sioux" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sioux</a> tradition, and Crow Dog paid restitution. However, the United States government then also tried Crow Dog for murder, and he was sentenced to hang. On his appeal to the Supreme Court, the court held that unless <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">Congress</a> authorized it, the courts had no jurisdiction to try the case.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> This case resulted in Congress enacting the <a href="Major_Crimes_Act" title="wikilink">Major Crimes Act</a> in 1885, placing 15 major crimes under federal jurisdiction if committed by an Indian against another Indian on a reservation or tribal land. This case was the beginning of the <a href="Plenary_power" title="wikilink">plenary power</a> legal doctrine that has been used in Indian case law to limit <a href="Tribal_sovereignty" title="wikilink">tribal sovereignty</a>.</p>

<p><img src="Thomas_Stanley_Matthews_-_Brady-Handy.jpg" title="fig:Justice T. Stanley Matthews, author of the unanimous opinion" alt="Justice T. Stanley Matthews, author of the unanimous opinion" width="200" /> Justice <a href="Stanley_Matthews_(lawyer)" title="wikilink">Stanley Matthews</a> delivered the opinion of the unanimous court. Matthews noted that Crow Dog was indicted for murder under a statute prohibiting murder on federal land.{{#tag:ref|&quot;Every person who commits murder-- ... or in any other place under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States; ... shall suffer death.&quot;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a>|group=&quot;fn&quot;}}<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Matthews then looked at the federal laws dealing with Indians, including a statute that applied the prohibition on murder to Indian reservations{{#tag:ref|&quot;...the general laws of the United States as to punishment of crimes committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, except the District of Columbia, shall extend to Indian country.&quot;<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a>|group=&quot;fn&quot;}}<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> and another covering exceptions to prosecution.{{#tag:ref|&quot;The preceding section shall not be construed to extend to crimes committed by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian, nor to any Indian committing any offense who has been punished by the local laws of the tribe...&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a>|group=&quot;fn&quot;}}<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The first statute prohibited murder on federal land, the second statute applied the first statute to reservations, and the last had specific exceptions to prosecution. Matthews felt that this last section was the most critical one in the case, with the section stating unequivocally that federal law: &quot;shall not be construed to extend to [crimes committed by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian, nor to] any Indian committing any offense in the Indian country who has been punished by the local law of the tribe&quot;<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> (brackets in original). Matthews rejected the contention of the United States that the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie implicitly repealed the exceptions to prosecution. He stated that since the law had not been amended or changed, and since implied repeals are not favored unless the implication is necessary, to allow such a repeal would be to reverse the general policy of the United States. Matthews said that such a repeal required a &quot;clear expression of the intention of Congress,&quot; which was not present in the case. In a clear evocation of the principle of tribal sovereignty,<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Matthews stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It tries them, not by their peers, nor by the customs of their people, nor the law of their land, but by superiors of a different race, according to the law of a social state of which they have an imperfect conception, and which is opposed to the traditions of their history, to the habits of their lives, to the strongest prejudices of their savage nature; one which measures the red man's revenge by the maxims of the white man's morality.&quot;<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

<p>As a result, the trial court was without jurisdiction to hear the case, and the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> was issued, discharging Crow Dog from federal custody.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a><a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

<p><em>Crow Dog</em> had a tremendous impact on <a href="Tribal_sovereignty_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">tribal sovereignty</a>.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> The decision recognized two distinct concepts in addition to those related to criminal law. First, Justice Matthews had noted that under <em><a href="Cherokee_Nation_v._Georgia" title="wikilink">Cherokee Nation v. Georgia</a></em>, (1831)<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> the Brul&lt;U+00E9&gt; tribe had a right to its own law in <a href="Indian_Country" title="wikilink">Indian Country</a>.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Part of this ruling was based on American constitutional tradition - at that time, Indians were not U.S. citizens{{#tag:ref|Indians did not become U.S. citizens until 1924, upon passage of the <a href="Indian_Citizenship_Act_of_1924" title="wikilink">Indian Citizenship Act of 1924</a><a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a>|group=&quot;fn&quot;}} and according to Matthews did not have a &lt;U+201C&gt;voice in the selection of representatives and the framing of the laws.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a><a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> The case held that Indian tribes retain sovereignty, and was still valid law. For example, <em><a href="United_States_v._Lara" title="wikilink">United States v. Lara</a></em>, (2004)<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> cited <em>Crow Dog</em> when holding that both a tribe and the federal government could prosecute Lara, as they were separate sovereigns. Subsequent cases have supported the concept &quot;that tribal Indians living in Indian country are citizens of the United States first (under the <a href="plenary_power" title="wikilink">plenary power</a> doctrine), the tribes second, and the states third, and then only to the extent that Congress chooses.&quot;<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>Currently the tribes are authorized to operate their own courts, not as a right of tribal sovereignty, but under a federal law.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a><a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> As of 2007, about half of the federally recognized tribes have tribal courts.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> The power of these courts are limited to minor crimes with a maximum punishment of a $5,000 fine and imprisonment of no more than one year.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> As a result of Crow Dog and ensuing legislation, jurisdiction in Indian country is complex, as shown by the following table:<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
