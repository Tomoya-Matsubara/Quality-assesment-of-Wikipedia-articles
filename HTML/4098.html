Considered to be a combination of <a href="Americana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Americana</a> art and <a href="cubism" class="uri" title="wikilink">cubism</a>, the work is referred to as the beginning to Lichtenstein's work on pop art. 25 editions of the lithograph were made by Lichtenstein, which were exhibited at several galleries.

Lichtenstein created his first lithograph and woodcut artwork in 1948, while he was working on receiving his graduate degree in fine arts from <a href="Ohio_State_University" title="wikilink">Ohio State University</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> During the late 1940s, he created abstract paintings influenced by several artists, namely <a href="Pablo_Picasso" title="wikilink">Pablo Picasso</a>. From 1951 through early 1956, Lichtenstein painted &quot;jagged, post-cubist&quot; designs of famous American artworks. Many of his pieces reflected portraits of the American west, especially native Americans and cowboys, as well as other genres, such as works of president <a href="George_Washington" title="wikilink">George Washington</a>. The period is referred to by Lichtenstein as his &quot;American&quot; series, and was generally negatively received by critics.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> However, during this period, Lichtenstein also began experimenting in abstract expressionism, using the technique on several of his western painting designs. However, they were poorly received, being called by one critic &quot;like the doodling of a five-year old&quot;.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Twenty-five editions of <em>Ten Dollar Bill</em> were created by Lichtenstein, which were given to several private collectors and museums.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Starting in late October of 1994, <em>Ten Dollar Bill</em>, as well as 89 of Lichtenstein's print artworks went on display at the <a href="National_Gallery_of_Art" title="wikilink">National Gallery of Art</a> in <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> As a part of &quot;The Prints of Roy Lichtenstein&quot;, the piece was displayed in Washington until January 8, 1995 before it was moved to the <a href="Los_Angeles_County_Museum_of_Art" title="wikilink">Los Angeles County Museum of Art</a> and put on display starting in mid-February that year, as part of that city's <a href="WinterFest" class="uri" title="wikilink">WinterFest</a> '95.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The tour moved in May to the <a href="Dallas_Museum_of_Art" title="wikilink">Dallas Museum of Art</a>, the final place it was displayed.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In December of 1996, Lichtenstein and his wife donated 154 prints of his artwork to the National Gallery of Art for permanent keeping. Among other famous pieces, including <em><a href="Crying_Girl" title="wikilink">Crying Girl</a></em>, was one of the copies of <em>Ten Dollar Bill</em>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> An edition of the piece was a part of the showcase opening exhibit &quot;$how Me the Money: The Dollar As Art&quot; for the <a href="American_Numismatic_Association" title="wikilink">American Numismatic Association</a> Money Museum, in <a href="Colorado_Springs,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Colorado Springs, Colorado</a>. The exhibit ran from October 4, 2002, until December 1. The lithograph was showcased alongside work from <a href="Andy_Warhol" title="wikilink">Andy Warhol</a>, <a href="Robert_Dowd" title="wikilink">Robert Dowd</a>, and others.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The work was part of the &quot;Roy Lichtenstein Prints 1956-1997&quot; collection, created entirely from the family gallery of Jordan Schnitzer. The tour began in June of 2006 at the <a href="Jordan_Schnitzer_Museum_of_Art" title="wikilink">Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art</a>, and traveled across the country,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> exhibiting in <a href="Austin,_Texas" title="wikilink">Austin, Texas</a> and <a href="Las_Vegas" title="wikilink">Las Vegas</a>, among other places.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Based on the design for the <a href="United_States_ten-dollar_bill" title="wikilink">United States ten-dollar bill</a>, <em>Ten Dollar Bill</em> measures , and is drawn on sheets of paper with dimensions of .<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Classified as a proto-<a href="pop_art" title="wikilink">pop art</a> work, the lithograph is considered to be &quot;a Picasso-esque vision of what currency could look like&quot;, as well as a &quot;humorous&quot; combination of &quot;established art forms and Americana&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The drawing has the dimensions and shape of the ten-dollar bill, and completely covers the space needed, which has led to Lichtenstein being considered as &quot;almost seeming to be forging money&quot;. The picture has been described as being a &quot;brand-new bill of tender and not a picture of one&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The &quot;schematic head&quot; of the medallion portrait of <a href="Alexander_Hamilton" title="wikilink">Alexander Hamilton</a>, the prominent feature of the print, &quot;shows him as a planar, anteater-like being&quot; with a &quot;hair-do of the young Picasso&quot; and eyes similar to a &quot;figure by <a href="Francis_Picabia" title="wikilink">Francis Picabia</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The exterior framing for <em>The Dollar Bill</em> was &quot;simplified&quot; from the original dollar design, appearing in &quot;an imbalanced, drunken fashion&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
