<p><strong>Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia</strong> (; <em>Olga Alexandrovna Romanova</em>) ( &lt;U+2013&gt; 24 November 1960) was the youngest child of Emperor <a href="Alexander_III_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Alexander III of Russia</a>. Her older brother was <a href="Tsar_Nicholas_II" title="wikilink">Tsar Nicholas II</a>.</p>
<p>She was raised at the <a href="Gatchina" title="wikilink">Gatchina Palace</a> outside of <a href="Saint_Petersburg" title="wikilink">Saint Petersburg</a>. Olga's relationship with her mother, Empress <a href="Maria_Feodorovna_(Dagmar_of_Denmark)" title="wikilink">Marie</a>, the daughter of King <a href="Christian_IX_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Christian IX of Denmark</a>, was strained and distant from childhood. In contrast, she and her father enjoyed their time together and shared intimate secrets. He died when she was 12, and her brother Nicholas became emperor.</p>
<p>In 1901, she married <a href="Duke_Peter_Alexandrovich_of_Oldenburg" title="wikilink">Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg</a>, who was privately believed by family and friends to be homosexual. The marriage did not last and was annulled in 1916, allowing Olga to marry untitled commoner <a href="Nikolai_Kulikovsky" title="wikilink">Nikolai Kulikovsky</a>, whom she had fallen in love with during her first marriage. After the downfall of the <a href="Romanov" title="wikilink">Romanovs</a> in the <a href="Russian_Revolution_of_1917" title="wikilink">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>, she fled to the <a href="Crimea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crimea</a> with her mother, husband, and children, where they were placed under house arrest and lived under the threat of assassination. Her brother and his family, including Olga's niece <a href="Grand_Duchess_Anastasia_Nikolaevna_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Grand Duchess Anastasia</a>, were <a href="Shooting_of_the_Romanov_family" title="wikilink">shot by revolutionaries</a>. After her escape from Russia in 1919, Olga was often sought out by <a href="Romanov_impostors" title="wikilink">Romanov impostors</a> who claimed to be her dead relatives. She met <a href="Anna_Anderson" title="wikilink">Anna Anderson</a>, the best-known Anastasia impostor, in <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a> in 1925.</p>
<p>Olga lived in exile in Denmark until 1948 when, feeling threatened by <a href="Stalin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stalin</a>'s regime, she moved her direct family to a farm in <a href="Ontario" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ontario</a>, <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>. Like her father, she preferred to avoid extravagance and sought simplicity. During her lifetime, she painted over 2,000 works of art, which provided income for both her family and the charitable causes she supported. She lived in Canada until her death in a flat in East <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a> at the age of 78. She died seven months after her older sister, <a href="Grand_Duchess_Xenia_Alexandrovna_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Xenia</a>. At the end of her life and afterwards, Olga was widely labelled the last Grand Duchess of Imperial Russia.</p>

The older children and the empress complete the group." /> Olga was the youngest daughter of <a href="Alexander_III_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Tsar Alexander III</a> and his consort, <a href="Maria_Feodorovna_(Dagmar_of_Denmark)" title="wikilink">Marie Feodorovna</a>, formerly Princess Dagmar of Denmark. She was <a href="born_in_the_purple" title="wikilink">born in the purple</a>, <em>i.e.</em> during her father's reign, on 13 June 1882 in the <a href="Peterhof_Palace" title="wikilink">Peterhof Palace</a>, west of <a href="Saint_Petersburg" title="wikilink">Saint Petersburg</a>. Her birth was announced by a traditional 101-gun salute from the ramparts of the <a href="Peter_and_Paul_Fortress" title="wikilink">Peter and Paul Fortress</a>, and similar salutes throughout the <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russian Empire</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Her mother, advised by her sister, <a href="Alexandra_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Alexandra, Princess of Wales</a>, placed Olga in the care of an English nanny, Elizabeth Franklin.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The Russian imperial family was a frequent target for assassins, so for safety reasons the Grand Duchess was raised at the country palace of <a href="Gatchina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gatchina</a>, about 50 miles (80 km) west of Saint Petersburg. Olga and her siblings, however, were not accustomed to a lavish early lifestyle. Conditions in the nursery were modest, even Spartan.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> They slept on hard camp beds, rose at dawn, washed in cold water, and ate a simple porridge for breakfast.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Olga left Gatchina for the first time in the early fall of 1888 when the imperial family visited the <a href="Caucasus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caucasus</a>. On 29 October, their return train approached the small town of <a href="Borki_(Kharkiv_oblast)" title="wikilink">Borki</a> at speed. Olga's parents and their four older children were eating lunch in the dining-car when the train lurched violently and came off the rails. The carriage was torn open; the heavy iron roof caved in, and the wheels and floor of the car were sliced off. The Tsar crawled out from beneath the crushed roof, and held it up with &quot;a Herculean effort&quot; so that the others could escape.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> There were 21 fatalities. Empress Marie helped tend the wounded, and made makeshift bandages from her own clothes.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> An official investigation found that <a href="Borki_train_disaster" title="wikilink">the crash</a> was an accident,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> but it was widely assumed that two bombs had been planted on the line.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The Grand Duchess and her siblings were taught at home by private tutors. Subjects included history, geography, Russian, English and French, as well as drawing and dancing.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Physical activities such as <a href="equestrianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">equestrianism</a> were taught at an early age, and they became expert riders.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The family was deeply religious. Although Christmas and Easter were times of celebration and extravagance, <a href="Lent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lent</a> was strictly observed&lt;U+2014&gt;meat, dairy products and any form of entertainment were avoided.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Family holidays were taken in the summer at Peterhof and with Olga's grandparents in Denmark.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <img src="Portrait_of_Grand_Duchess_Olga_Alexandrovna.jpg" title="fig:Portrait of Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna in 1893 by Valentin Serov" alt="Portrait of Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna in 1893 by Valentin Serov" /> Empress Marie was reserved and formal with Olga as a child, and their relationship remained a difficult one.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> However, Olga, her father, and the youngest of her brothers, <a href="Grand_Duke_Michael_Alexandrovich_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Michael</a>, had a close relationship. Together, the three frequently went on hikes within the Gatchina forests, where the Tsar taught Olga and Michael woodsmanship.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Olga said of her father: </p>
<p>During 1894 Olga's father became increasingly ill, and the annual trip to Denmark was cancelled.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> On 13 November 1894, he died at the age of 49. The emotional impact on Olga, aged only 12, was traumatic,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and her eldest brother, the new <a href="Tsar_Nicholas_II" title="wikilink">Tsar Nicholas II</a>, was propelled into a role for which in Olga's later opinion he was ill-prepared.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="tsarskoye-selo">Tsarskoye Selo</h2>
<p>Olga was due to enter society in the summer of 1899, but after the death of her brother <a href="Grand_Duke_George_Alexandrovich_of_Russia" title="wikilink">George</a> at the age of 27, her first official public appearance was delayed by a year until 1900.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> She hated the experience, and later told her official biographer Ian Vorres, &quot;I felt as though I were an animal in a cage&lt;U+2014&gt;exhibited to the public for the first time.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> From 1901, Olga was appointed honorary Commander-in-Chief of the 12th Akhtyrsky Hussar Regiment of the <a href="Imperial_Russian_Army" title="wikilink">Imperial Russian Army</a>. The Akhtyrsky Hussars were famous for their victory over <a href="Napoleon_Bonaparte" title="wikilink">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> at the <a href="Battle_of_Kulm" title="wikilink">Battle of Kulm</a> in 1813, and wore a distinctive brown <a href="dolman" class="uri" title="wikilink">dolman</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>At the age of 19, on 9 August 1901, she married 33-year-old <a href="Duke_Peter_Alexandrovich_of_Oldenburg" title="wikilink">Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg</a>, a member of the Russian branch of the <a href="House_of_Oldenburg" title="wikilink">House of Oldenburg</a>, and the couple moved into a 200-room palace on Sergievskaya street in <a href="Saint_Petersburg" title="wikilink">Saint Petersburg</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The marriage, announced in May, was not expected by many, as Peter had shown no prior interest in women,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and members of society assumed he was homosexual.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> His proposal even came as a surprise to Olga, who later explained, &quot;I was so taken aback that all I could say was 'thank you'&quot;.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Their marriage remained unconsummated,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and Olga suspected that Peter was pushed into proposing by his ambitious mother.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Biographer Patricia Phenix thought Olga may have accepted his proposal to gain independence from her own mother, the Dowager Empress Marie, or avoid marriage into a foreign court.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Near the Oldenburg's estate, <a href="Ramon,_Russia" title="wikilink">Ramon</a> in <a href="Voronezh_Oblast" title="wikilink">Voronezh province</a>, Olga had her own villa, called &quot;Olgino&quot; after the local town.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> She subsidized the village school out of her own pocket, and established a hospital.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Her daughter-in-law later wrote, &quot;She tried to help every needy person as far as her strengths and means would permit.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> At the hospital, she learned basic medical treatment and proper care from the local doctor.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> She exemplified her strong <a href="Russian_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Orthodox</a> faith by creating religious icons, which she distributed to the charitable endeavours she supported.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1903, she was introduced to a Blue <a href="Cuirassier" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuirassier</a> Guards officer <a href="Nikolai_Kulikovsky" title="wikilink">Nikolai Kulikovsky</a> by her brother Michael during a royal military review at <a href="Pavlovsk_Palace" title="wikilink">Pavlovsk Palace</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Olga and Kulikovsky began to see each other, and exchanged letters regularly. The same year, at the age of 22, she confronted her husband and asked for a divorce, which he refused with the qualification that he might reconsider after seven years.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Nevertheless, Oldenburg appointed Kulikovsky as an <a href="aide-de-camp" class="uri" title="wikilink">aide-de-camp</a>, and allowed him to live in the same residence as Oldenburg and the Grand Duchess on Sergievskaya street.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The relationship between Kulikovsky and the Grand Duchess was not public,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> but gossip about their romance spread through society.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>From 1904 to 1906, Duke Peter was appointed to a military post in <a href="Tsarskoye_Selo" title="wikilink">Tsarskoye Selo</a>, a complex of palaces just south of Saint Petersburg. In Tsarskoye Selo, the Grand Duchess grew close to her brother Nicholas and his family, who lived at the <a href="Alexander_Palace" title="wikilink">Alexander Palace</a> near her own residence.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Olga prized her connection to the Tsar's four daughters.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> From 1906 to 1914, Olga took her nieces to parties and engagements in Saint Petersburg, without their parents, every weekend throughout the winter.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> She especially took a liking to the youngest of Nicholas's daughters, her god-daughter Anastasia, whom she called <em>Shvipsik</em> (&quot;little one&quot;).<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Through her brother and sister-in-law, Olga met <a href="Rasputin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rasputin</a>, a self-styled holy man who purported to have healing powers. Although she made no public criticisms of Rasputin's association with the imperial family, she was unconvinced of his supposed powers and privately disliked him.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> As Olga grew close to her brother's family, her relationship with her other surviving brother, Michael, deteriorated. To her and Nicholas's horror, Michael eloped with his mistress, a twice-divorced commoner, and communication between Michael and the rest of the family was essentially cut off.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Public unrest over the <a href="Russo-Japanese_War" title="wikilink">Russo-Japanese War</a> and <a href="1905_Russian_Revolution" title="wikilink">demands for political reform</a> increased in the early years of the twentieth century. At <a href="Epiphany_(holiday)" title="wikilink">Epiphany</a> 1905, a band of revolutionaries fired live rounds at the <a href="Winter_Palace" title="wikilink">Winter Palace</a> from the <a href="Peter_and_Paul_Fortress" title="wikilink">Peter and Paul Fortress</a>. Olga and the Dowager Empress were showered with glass splinters from a smashed window, but were unharmed.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Three weeks later, on &quot;<a href="Bloody_Sunday_(1905)" title="wikilink">Bloody Sunday</a>&quot;, at least 92 people were killed by <a href="Cossack" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cossack</a> troops during a demonstration,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> and a month later Olga's uncle, <a href="Grand_Duke_Sergei_Alexandrovich_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia</a>, was assassinated.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Uprisings occurred throughout the country, and parts of the navy mutinied.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Olga supported the appointment of the liberal <a href="Pyotr_Stolypin" title="wikilink">Pyotr Stolypin</a> as prime minister, and he embarked on a <a href="Stolypin_reform" title="wikilink">programme of gradual reform</a>, but in 1911 he was assassinated.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The public unrest, Michael's elopement, and Olga's sham marriage placed her under strain, and in 1912, while visiting England with her mother, she suffered a nervous breakdown.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> <a href="Alexandra_Feodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse)" title="wikilink">Tsarina Alexandra</a> was also unwell with fatigue, concerned by the poor health of her <a href="Hemophilia" title="wikilink">hemophiliac</a> son, <a href="Tsarevich_Alexei_Nikolaevich_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Alexei</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Olga stood in for the Tsarina at public events, and accompanied her brother on a tour of the interior, while the Tsarina remained at home.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>On 1 August 1914, just before the start of <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, Olga's regiment, the Akhtyrsky Hussars, appeared at an Imperial Review before her and the Tsar at <a href="Krasnoe_Selo" title="wikilink">Krasnoe Selo</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Kulikovsky volunteered for service with the Hussars, who were stationed on the frontlines in Southwestern Russia.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> With the Grand Duchess's prior medical knowledge from the village of Olgino, she started work as a nurse at an under-staffed Red Cross hospital in <a href="Rovno" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rovno</a>, near to where her own regiment was stationed.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> During the war, she came under heavy Austrian fire while attending the regiment at the front.

<p>In 1916, <a href="Tsar_Nicholas_II" title="wikilink">Tsar Nicholas II</a> officially annulled the marriage between Duke Peter Alexandrovich and the Grand Duchess, allowing her to marry Colonel Kulikovsky.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The service was performed on 16 November 1916 in the Kievo-Vasilievskaya Church on Triokhsviatitelskaya (Three Saints Street) in <a href="Kiev" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kiev</a>. The only guests were the Dowager Empress <a href="Maria_Feodorovna_(Dagmar_of_Denmark)" title="wikilink">Marie</a>, Olga's brother-in-law <a href="Grand_Duke_Alexander_Mikhailovich_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Grand Duke Alexander</a>, four officers of the Akhtyrsky Regiment, and two of Olga's fellow nurses from the hospital in Kiev.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>During the war, internal tensions and economic deprivation in Russia continued to mount and revolutionary sympathies grew. After Tsar Nicholas II was deposed in early 1917, many members of the Romanov dynasty, including Nicholas and his immediate family, were detained under house arrest. In search of safety, the Dowager Empress, Grand Duke Alexander, and Grand Duchess Olga travelled to the <a href="Crimea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crimea</a> by special train, where they were joined by Olga's sister <a href="Grand_Duchess_Xenia_Alexandrovna_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Grand Duchess Xenia</a>.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> They lived at Alexander's estate, Ay-Todor, about 12 miles (19 km) from <a href="Yalta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yalta</a>, where they were placed under house arrest by the local forces.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> On 12 August 1917, her first child and son, Tikhon Nikolaevich was born during their virtual imprisonment.

<p>The Romanovs isolated in the Crimea knew little of the fate of the Tsar and his family. Nicholas, Alexandra, and their children, were originally held at their official residence, the Alexander Palace, but the Provisional government under <a href="Alexander_Kerensky" title="wikilink">Alexander Kerensky</a> relocated them to <a href="Tobolsk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tobolsk</a>, <a href="Siberia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Siberia</a>. In February 1918, most of the imperial family at Ay-Todor was moved to another estate at Djulber, where Grand Dukes <a href="Grand_Duke_Nicholas_Nikolaevich_of_Russia_(1856&lt;U+2013&gt;1929)" title="wikilink">Nicholas</a> and <a href="Grand_Duke_Peter_Nikolaevich_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Peter</a> were already under house arrest.

Well, there is no resemblance at all, and it is obviously not Anastasia ... It was pitiful to watch this poor creature trying to prove she was Anastasia. She showed her feet, a finger with a scar and other marks which she said were bound to be recognized at once. But it was Maria who had a crushed finger, and someone must have told her this. For four years this poor creature's head was stuffed with all these stories ... It has been claimed, however, that we all recognized her and were then given instructions by Mama to deny that she was Anastasia. That is a complete lie.
