<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p><img src="Horseracing_Churchill_Downs.jpg" title="fig:Race at Churchill Downs" alt="Race at Churchill Downs" /> Horse racing in the United States and on the North American continent dates back to the establishment of another course named Newmarket&lt;U+2014&gt;on the <a href="Salisbury_Plains" title="wikilink">Salisbury Plains</a> section of what is now known as the Hempstead Plains of <a href="Long_Island" title="wikilink">Long Island</a>, New York in 1665. This first racing meet in North America was supervised by New York's colonial governor, <a href="Richard_Nicolls" title="wikilink">Richard Nicolls</a>. The area is now occupied by the present <a href="Nassau_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Nassau County, New York</a> region of Greater <a href="Westbury,_New_York" title="wikilink">Westbury</a> and East Garden City.

<h4 id="thoroughbred-racing-in-the-united-states">Thoroughbred racing in the United States</h4>
<p>In 1665, the first racetrack was constructed on Long Island. It is the oldest thoroughbred race in North America. The <a href="American_Stud_Book" title="wikilink">American Stud Book</a> was started in 1868, which prompted the beginning of organized horse racing in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. There were 314 tracks operating in the United States by 1890 and in 1894, the American Jockey Club was formed.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The anti-gambling sentiment prevalent in the early 1900s led almost all states to ban <a href="bookmaking" class="uri" title="wikilink">bookmaking</a>. Bookmaking is the process of taking bets, calculating odds, and paying out winnings. This nearly eliminated horse racing altogether. When <a href="parimutuel_betting" title="wikilink">parimutuel betting</a> was introduced in 1908, the racing industry turned around.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Horse racing flourished until World War II.

<p>The style of racing, the distances and the type of events varies very much by the country in which the race is occurring, and many countries offer different types of horse races.</p>
<p>In the United States, Thoroughbred flat races are run on surfaces of either dirt, synthetic or turf; other tracks offer <a href="American_Quarter_Horse" title="wikilink">Quarter Horse</a> racing and <a href="Standardbred_horse" title="wikilink">Standardbred horse</a> racing, or combinations of these three types of racing surfaces. Racing with other breeds, such as Arabian horse racing, is found on a limited basis. American Thoroughbred races are run at a wide variety of distances, most commonly from ; with this in mind, breeders of Thoroughbred race horses attempt to breed horses that excel at a particular distance (see <a href="Dosage_Index" title="wikilink">Dosage Index</a>).</p>
<h3 id="race-length-and-track-surface">Race length and track surface</h3>
<h4 id="thoroughbred-racing">Thoroughbred racing</h4>
<p><a href="Flat_racing" title="wikilink">Flat racing</a> is the most common form of Thoroughbred racing. The track is typically oval in shape and the race is based on speed and stamina. Within the general category of Thoroughbred flat racing, there exist two separate types of races. These include <a href="conditions_races" title="wikilink">conditions races</a> and <a href="handicap_races" title="wikilink">handicap races</a>. Condition races are the most prestigious and offer the biggest <a href="purse_(horseracing)" title="wikilink">purses</a>. Handicap races assign each horse a different amount of weight to carry based on their ability.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Beside the weight they carry, the horse is also influenced by its closeness to the inside barrier, the track surface, its gender, the jockey, and the trainer. A typical Thoroughbred race is run on dirt, synthetic or turf surfaces. Viscoride and Polytrack are synthetic substitutes. Thoroughbred races vary in distance, but are usually somewhere between five and twelve furlongs. A <a href="furlong" class="uri" title="wikilink">furlong</a> is a distance measurement equal to one eighth of a mile, 220 yards.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> or 201.168 metres.</p>
<h4 id="endurance-racing-1">Endurance racing</h4>
<p>The length of an endurance race varies greatly. Some are very short, only ten miles, while others can be up to one hundred miles. There are a few races that are even longer than one hundred miles and last multiple days.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> These different lengths of races are divided into five categories: pleasure rides (10&lt;U+2013&gt;20 miles), non-competitive trail rides (21&lt;U+2013&gt;27 miles), competitive trail rides (20&lt;U+2013&gt;45 miles), progressive trail rides (25&lt;U+2013&gt;60 miles), and endurance rides (40&lt;U+2013&gt;100 miles in one day, up to 150 miles in multiple days).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Because each race is very long, the tracks are almost always just dirt.</p>
<h4 id="quarter-horse-racing-1">Quarter Horse racing</h4>
<p>When Quarter Horse racing began, it was very expensive to lay a full mile of track so it was agreed that a straight track of four hundred meters, or one quarter of a mile would be laid instead.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> It became the standard racing distance for Quarter Horses and inspired their name. With the exception of the longer,  distance contests, Quarter Horse races are run flat out, with the horses running at top speed for the duration. There is less jockeying for position, as turns are rare, and many races end with several contestants grouped together at the wire. The track surface is similar to that of Thoroughbred racing and usually consists of dirt or a synthetic surface.</p>
<h3 id="horse-breeds-and-muscle-structure">Horse breeds and muscle structure</h3>
<p>Muscles are just bundles of stringy fibers that are attached to bones by tendons. These bundles have different types of fibers within them and horses have adapted over the years to produce different amounts of these fibers. Type IIb fibers are fast twitch fibers. These fibers allow muscles to contract quickly resulting in a great deal of power and speed. Type I fibers are slow-twitch fibers. They allow muscles to work for longer periods of time resulting in greater endurance. Type IIa fibers are in the middle. They are a balance between the fast twitch fibers and the slow-twitch fibers. They allow the muscles to generate both speed and endurance. Type I muscles are absolutely necessary for aerobic exercise because they rely on the presence of oxygen in order to work. Type II muscles are needed for anaerobic exercise because they can function without the presence of oxygen.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</h4>
<p>There are three founding sires that almost all Thoroughbreds can trace back to: the <a href="Darley_Arabian" title="wikilink">Darley Arabian</a>, the <a href="Godolphin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Godolphin</a>, and the <a href="Byerly_Turk" title="wikilink">Byerly Turk</a>, named after their respective owners, <a href="Thomas_Darley" title="wikilink">Thomas Darley</a>, Lord Godolphin, and Captain Robert Byerly.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> All were taken to England where they were mated with racing mares. Thoroughbreds come in many different colors, all of which are recognized by the Jockey Club. However, the most prevalent include <a href="Bay_(horse)" title="wikilink">bay</a>, <a href="Chestnut_(coat)" title="wikilink">chestnut</a>, black, brown, and gray. Thoroughbreds range in height, and are measured in <a href="Hand_(length)" title="wikilink">hands</a> (a hand being four <a href="inch" title="wikilink">inches</a>). Some are as small as 15 hands while others are over 17 hands. Thoroughbreds can travel medium distances at fast paces, requiring a balance between speed and endurance. They possess more Type IIa muscle fibers than the Quarter Horse or Arabian. This type of fiber allows them to propel themselves forward at great speeds and maintain it for an extended distance.</p>
<h4 id="arabian-horse">Arabian Horse</h4>
<p>The Arabian Horse was prevalent in societies as early as 1500 B.C. The Bedouin Tribe in <a href="Arabia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arabia</a> specifically bred these horses for stamina, so they could outrun their enemies. It was not until 1725 that the Arabian was introduced into the United States.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The Arabian Horse is primarily used in endurance racing. They must be able to withstand traveling long distances at a moderate pace. Arabians have an abundance of Type I fibers. Their muscles are able to work for extended periods of time. Also, the muscles of the Arabian are not nearly as massive as those of the Quarter Horse, which allow it to travel longer distances at quicker speeds.</p>
<h4 id="quarter-horse">Quarter Horse</h4>
<p>The Quarter Horse was prevalent in America in the early 1600s. These horses were of mainly Spanish origin until the English horses were brought over. The native horse and the English horse were bred together, resulting in a very compact muscular horse. At this time, they were mainly used for chores such as plowing and cattle work. The Quarter Horse was not recognized as an official breed until the formation of the American Quarter Horse Association in 1940.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>In order to be successful in racing, Quarter Horses needed to be able to propel themselves forward at extremely fast paces. The Quarter Horse has much larger hind limb muscles than the Arabian, which make it much less suitable for endurance racing.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> They also have more Type IIb fibers, which allow the Quarter Horse to accelerate rapidly.</p>
<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
<p>The conditioning program for the different horses varies depending on the race length. Genetics, training, age, and skeletal soundness are all factors that contribute to a horse&lt;U+2019&gt;s performance.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The muscle structure and fiber type of horses depends on the breed, therefore genetics must be considered when constructing a conditioning plan. A horse&lt;U+2019&gt;s fitness plan must be coordinated properly in order to prevent injury or unnecessary lameness. If these were to occur, they may negatively affect a horse&lt;U+2019&gt;s willingness to learn.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Sprinting exercises are appropriate for training two-year-old racehorses, but they are mentally incapable of handling too many of them.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> A horse&lt;U+2019&gt;s skeletal system adapts to the exercise they are receiving. Because the skeletal system does not reach full maturity until the horse is at least four years of age, young racehorses often suffer multiple injuries.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="important-races">Important races</h3>
<p>The traditional high point of US horse racing is the <a href="Kentucky_Derby" title="wikilink">Kentucky Derby</a>. Together, the Derby, the <a href="Preakness_Stakes" title="wikilink">Preakness Stakes</a> run at <a href="Pimlico_Race_Course" title="wikilink">Pimlico Race Course</a> in <a href="Baltimore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baltimore</a>, <a href="Maryland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maryland</a>, and the <a href="Belmont_Stakes" title="wikilink">Belmont Stakes</a> held at <a href="Belmont_Park" title="wikilink">Belmont Park</a> on Long Island, form the <a href="Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing" title="wikilink">Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing</a> for three-year-olds. They are all held early in the year, throughout May and the beginning of June. In recent years the <a href="Breeders&#39;_Cup" title="wikilink">Breeders' Cup</a> races, run at the end of the year, have challenged the Triple Crown events as determiners of the three-year-old Champion. The Breeders' Cup is held at a different track every year; the 2008 edition was held at Santa Anita. It also has an important effect on the selection of other annual Champions. The corresponding Standardbred event is the Breeders' Crown. There are also a <a href="Triple_Crown_of_Harness_Racing_for_Pacers" title="wikilink">Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers</a> and a <a href="Triple_Crown_of_Harness_Racing_for_Trotters" title="wikilink">Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Trotters</a>, as well as an Arabian Triple Crown consisting of Drinkers of the Wind Derby in California, the Texas Six Shooter Stakes, and the Bob Magness Derby in Delaware.</p>
<p>Thoroughbred and Arabian fillies have their own &quot;Triple&quot; series, commonly referred to as The Triple Tiara. While there is some disagreement over which three races make up the <a href="Triple_Tiara_of_Thoroughbred_Racing" title="wikilink">Triple Tiara of Thoroughbred Racing</a>, the Arabian list is more formal and consists of Daughters of the Desert Oaks in California, the Texas Yellow Rose Stakes, and the Cre Run Oaks in Delaware.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="betting">Betting</h3>
<p>American betting on horse racing is sanctioned and regulated by the state the racetrack is located in. Simulcast betting almost always exist across state lines with no oversight except the companies involved through legalized <a href="parimutuel_gambling" title="wikilink">parimutuel gambling</a>. A takeout, or &quot;take&quot;, is removed from each betting pool and distributed according to state law, among the state, race track and horsemen. On average, 17 percent is withheld from win, place and show pools, with 83 percent being returned to the winning players.</p>

<p>Racing is a long-established sport in <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a>, stretching back to colonial times.</p>
<p>Horse racing is a significant part of the New Zealand economy which in 2004 generated 1.3% of the <a href="GDP" class="uri" title="wikilink">GDP</a>. The indirect impact of expenditures on racing was estimated to have generated more than $1.4 billion in economic activity in 2004 and created 18,300 full-time equivalent jobs. More than 40,000 people were involved in some capacity in the New Zealand racing industry in 2004. In 2004, more than one million people attended race meetings in New Zealand.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> There are 69 Thoroughbred and 51 harness clubs licensed in New Zealand.

<p>There are a total of thirty racetracks in Japan. Ten of these tracks are known as &quot;central tracks&quot;, where most of Japan's top races are conducted. Races at these ten tracks are conducted by the <a href="Japan_Racing_Association" title="wikilink">Japan Racing Association</a> (JRA), which operates under the oversight of the Japanese government. The remaining twenty tracks are operated by municipal racing authorities and run under the affiliation of the <a href="National_Association_of_Racing" title="wikilink">National Association of Racing</a> (NAR). Two tracks, <a href="Sapporo_Racecourse" title="wikilink">Sapporo Racecourse</a> and <a href="Chukyo_Racecourse" title="wikilink">Chukyo Racecourse</a>, run separate meetings under either JRA or NAR jurisdiction.</p>

<h3 id="south-korea">South Korea</h3>
<p>Horse racing in South Korea traces back to May 1898, when a foreign language institute run by the government included a donkey race in its athletic rally. However, this type of racing was sponsored for entertainment purposes only. No betting was conducted. It was in 1920s that &quot;Modern Horse Racing&quot; involving a betting system made its debut. In 1922, the Chosun Racing Club, the nation's first-ever authorized horse racing club, was established to make horse racing more systematic and better organized. In 1923, the pari-mutuel betting system was officially adopted for the first time in Korea. The Sinseol-dong racecourse opened in 1928 and incorporated racing clubs were allowed to have their own racecourses.</p>
<p>Finally in 1933 a decree on horse racing was promulgated. Under the decree, only incorporated racing clubs were entitled to conduct horse racing. The Chosun Horse Racing Authority was also established in 1933 to coordinate and control incorporated racing clubs across the nation and ensure consistency in their administration.</p>
<p>In 1945, the Chosun Horse Affairs Authority was renamed to the Korea Racing Authority, and efforts were made to restore the national identity in horse racing. However, the Korean War which broke in 1950 resulted in great turmoil for Korean society, thus undermining the development of horse racing. Worse yet, during the three-year war, racecourses were requisitioned for military training and horse racing came to an abrupt halt.</p>
<p>To keep the tradition of horse racing alive, the Korea Racing Authority worked out a plan to reestablish the racecourse at Ttuksom in Seoul. The construction, which began during the war, was completed in May 1954. With its dedication, horse racing resumed, and the newly constructed Ttksom racecourse served as the hub of Korean horse racing until it was relocated to the modern racecourse in Gwacheon in 1989.</p>
<p>Pari-mutuel bets were tallied manually until 1984. The inefficient management of pari-mutuel betting system was a major stumbling block to broadening the fan base. To overcome this fundamental obstacle, the computerized pari-mutuel betting system was established in 1984, and at the same time, horse racing came to be televised in color, both on-&amp;off-course. These two measures have played a decisive role in boosting attendance and turnover. For instance, in 1984, turnover and attendance increased at 67% and 58%, respectively, from the previous year.</p>
<p>To form a link in the chain of the program to make the most of the Olympic facilities, the government designated the KRA as the organization exclusively responsible for providing the Olympic Equestrian Park. Accordingly, the KRA secured  of the land in Gwacheon area on the southern outskirts of Seoul, and began its construction in 1984 till 1988. After the Olympics, the Park was converted into racing facilities named <a href="Seoul_Race_Park" title="wikilink">Seoul Race Park</a> and the first race was held on September 1, 1989. With the opening of the Seoul Race Park, the 36-year-long era of the Ttuksom Racecourse came to an end and the nation's horse racing continued to make great strides.</p>
<p>As part of the efforts to preserve the ponies native to Jeju Island, which has been designated as Natural Monument No. 347, the KRA began the construction of the  Jeju Racecourse at the foot of Mt. Halla in October 1987. Three years later in October 1990, the Racecourse opened for pony racing.</p>
<p>As an effort to raise racing quality and promote horseracing nationwide, the KRA started to construct the new thoroughbred racecourse in Busan, the second largest city in South Korea. The racecourse opened in September 2005. The stellar growth of Korean racing and KRA's internationalization efforts have drawn the international attention since the beginning of the 2000s. Led by this, in October 2002, the Asian Racing Federation decided to designate South Korea as the host of the 30th Asian Racing Conference in May 2005. Also, in June 2004, the International Cataloguing Standards Committee included Korea as one of the Part III countries, and decided to add seven South Korean Grade Races to the Blue Book list starting from 2005.</p>

<h3 id="peoples-republic-of-china">People's Republic of China</h3>
<p>Horse racing was banned in the People&lt;U+2019&gt;s Republic of China in 1949, but reappeared on a small scale in the 1990s. In 2008, the China Speed Horse Race Open in Wuhan was organized as a step towards legalizing both horse racing and gambling on the races. Illegal gambling is widespread so the reintroduction of commercial racing may be an attempt to generate revenue on legal gambling.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="pedigree">Pedigree</h2>

<p>While the attention of horse racing fans and the media is focused almost exclusively on the horse's performance on the racetrack, or for male horses possibly its success as a sire, little publicity is given to brood mares. Such is the case of <a href="La_Troienne" title="wikilink">La Troienne</a>, one of the most important mares of the 20th century to whom many of the greatest thoroughbred champions, and dams of champions, can be traced.</p>
<p>In most horse races, including both flat and steeplechases, the pedigree of the horse is one of the things that allow it to race: the horse must have a sire (father) and a dam (mother) who are purebred individuals of whatever breed is racing.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> For example, in a normal harness race, the horses sire and dam must both be pure Standardbreds. The only exception to this is in Quarter Horse racing where an Appendixed Quarter Horse may be considered eligible to race against (standard) Quarter Horses. An appendixed Quarter Horse is a horse who has either one Quarter Horse parent and one parent of any other eligible breed (such as Thoroughbred, the most common Appendixed cross), or both parents are registered Appendixed Quarter Horses, or one parent is a Quarter Horse and one parent is an Appendixed Quarter Horse. The designation of &quot;Appendixed&quot; refers to the addendum section, or Appendix, of the Official Quarter Horse registry. AQHA also issues a &quot;Racing Register of Merit&quot; which allows a horse to race on Quarter Horse tracks, but not be considered a Quarter Horse for breeding purposes (unless other requirements are met).<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>A stallion who has won many races may be put up to <a href="Stud_(animal)" title="wikilink">stud</a> when he is retired. <a href="Embryo_transfer" title="wikilink">Embryo transfer</a> technology (only allowed in some breeds) has brought changes to the traditions and ease of breeding.</p>

<h2 id="betting-1">Betting</h2>

<p><img src="Betting_on_the_Favorite.jpg" title="fig:Betting on the Favorite, an 1870 engraving" alt="Betting on the Favorite, an 1870 engraving" /> At many horse races, there is a gambling station, where gamblers can stake money on a horse. Gambling on horses is prohibited at some tracks; the nationally renowned Colonial Cup Steeplechase in <a href="Camden,_South_Carolina" title="wikilink">Camden, South Carolina</a>, is known as one of the races where betting is illegal, due to a 1951 law. Where gambling is allowed, most tracks offer <a href="Parimutuel_betting" title="wikilink">Parimutuel betting</a> where gamblers' money is pooled and shared proportionally among the winners once a deduction is made from the pool. In some countries, such as UK, Ireland and Australia, an alternative and more popular facility is provided by <a href="bookmaker" title="wikilink">bookmakers</a> who effectively <a href="Market_maker" title="wikilink">make a market</a> in odds. This allows the gambler to 'lock in' odds on a horse at a particular time (known as 'taking the price' in the UK). <a href="Parimutuel_betting" title="wikilink">Parimutuel</a> <a href="gambling" class="uri" title="wikilink">gambling</a> on races also provides not only purse money to participants but considerable tax revenue, with over $100 billion wagered annually in 53 countries.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="types-of-bets">Types of bets</h3>

<p>In North American racing, the three most common ways to bet money are to win, to place, and to show. A bet to win, sometimes called a &quot;straight&quot; bet, means that you stake money on the horse, and if it comes in first place, the bet is a winner. In a bet to place, you are betting on your horse to finish either first or second. A bet to show wins if the horse finishes first, second or third. Since it is much easier to select a horse to finish first, second or third than it is to select a horse just for first, the show payoffs will be much lower on average than win payoffs.</p>
<p>In Europe, Australia and Asia, betting to place is different since the number of &quot;payout places&quot; varies depending on the size of the field that takes part in the race. For example, in a race with seven or less runners in the UK, only the first two finishers would be considered winning bets with most bookmakers. Three places are paid for eight or more runners, whilst a handicap race with 16 runners or more will see the first four places being classed as &quot;placed&quot;. (A show bet does not exist in the North American sense.)</p>
<p>The term &quot;Each-Way&quot; bet is used everywhere but North America, and has a different meaning depending on the location. An each-way (or E/W) bet sees the total bet being split in two, with half being placed on the win, and half on the place. Bettors receive a payout if the horse either wins, or is placed based on the place criteria as stated above. Most UK bookmakers cut the odds considerably for an each-way bet, offering the full odds if the horse wins but only a third, a quarter or a fifth of the odds if only the place section of the bet is successful. In the UK some bookmakers will offer a sixth of the odds for a place on the <a href="Grand_National" title="wikilink">Grand National</a> and increase the number of places available to achieve this to finishing in the first five. This additional concession is offered because of the large number of runners in the race (maximum 40). Occasionally other handicap races with large fields (numbers of runners) receive the same treatment from various bookmakers. The rough equivalent in North America is an &quot;across the board&quot; bet, where equal bets on a horse are set to win, place and show. Each portion is treated by the totalizator as a separate bet, so an across-the-board bet is merely a convenience for bettors and parimutuel clerks. For instance, if a $2 across-the-board bet (total outlay of $6) were staked on a horse which finished second, paying $4.20 to place and $3.00 to show, the bettor would receive $7.20 on what is essentially a $6 wager.</p>
<h3 id="betting-exchanges">Betting Exchanges</h3>
<p>In addition to traditional betting with a bookmaker, punters are able to both back and lay money on an online <a href="betting_exchange" title="wikilink">betting exchange</a>. Punters who lay the odds are in effect acting as a bookmaker. The odds of a horse are set by the market conditions of the betting exchange which is dictated to by the activity of the members.</p>
<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>
<p>Organized groups dedicated to protecting animals, such as the <a href="Humane_Society_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Humane Society of the United States</a> and <a href="People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals" title="wikilink">People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</a>, target some horse sports with claims of <a href="animal_cruelty" title="wikilink">animal cruelty</a>. Horse racing and <a href="rodeo" class="uri" title="wikilink">rodeo</a> are most commonly targeted, due both to their high visibility and to the level of stress and potential physical dangers to the equines involved. Criticism of horse racing and its practices runs a wide gamut, however; while some may consider even fairly drastic discipline of horses non-abusive, others may consider abuse to be anything done against the will of the animal in question. Some people may consider poor living conditions abusive, while others might consider riding abusive.</p>
<p>Some behaviors and activities are widely criticized as abusive by people within the horse industry, even if not illegal as a matter of public law, while others are so widely condemned that they have been outlawed at the federal level and violations can incur criminal penalties.</p>
<p>In 2009, <a href="animal_rights" title="wikilink">animal rights</a> group <a href="PETA" class="uri" title="wikilink">PETA</a> released undercover video of alleged abuses of former race horses at a slaughterhouse in <a href="Kumamoto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kumamoto</a>, <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>. The group states that 20,000 horses, including former Thoroughbred race horses, were killed in 2008 in Japan for use as human and pet food.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p>There are many dangers in horse racing for both horse and jockey: a horse can stumble and fall, or fall when jumping an obstacle, exposing both jockey and horse to the danger of being trampled and injured.</p>
<p>Anna Waller, a member of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of North Carolina, co-authored a four-year-long study of jockey injuries and stated to the New York Times that &quot;For every 1,000 jockeys you have riding, over 600 will have medically treated injuries.&quot; She added that almost 20% of these were serious head or neck injuries. The study reported 6,545 injuries during the years 1993&lt;U+2013&gt;1996.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> More than 100 jockeys were killed in the US between 1950 and 1987.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Horses also face dangers in racing. 1.5 horses die out of every 1000 starts in the US. The U.S. Jockey Club in New York estimates that about 600 horses died at racetracks in 2006. The Jockey Club in Hong Kong reported a far lower figure of .58 horses per 1000 starts. There is speculation that drugs used in horse racing in the US which are banned elsewhere are responsible for the higher death rate in the US.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
