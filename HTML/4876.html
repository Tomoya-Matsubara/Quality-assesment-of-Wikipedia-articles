<p><strong>U.S. Route 1 Business</strong> (<strong>US 1 Bus.</strong>) is a four-lane surface road that provides an alternate route to the <a href="Trenton_Freeway" title="wikilink">Trenton Freeway</a> (<a href="U.S._Route_1_in_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">US 1</a>) northeast of <a href="Trenton,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Trenton</a> in <a href="Mercer_County,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Mercer County, New Jersey</a>. The route is  long and runs between US 1 in Trenton and <a href="Lawrence_Township,_Mercer_County,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Lawrence Township</a>. On the border of Trenton and Lawrence Township, US 1 Bus. intersects the northbound direction of <a href="U.S._Route_206" title="wikilink">US 206</a> at the Brunswick Circle. The route was once part of a longer <strong>U.S. Route 1 Alternate</strong> (<strong>US 1 Alt.</strong>), which continued southwest through downtown Trenton and into <a href="Morrisville,_Bucks_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Morrisville, Pennsylvania</a>.</p>
<p>The old US 1 Alt. in Trenton is now signed by the <a href="New_Jersey_Department_of_Transportation" title="wikilink">New Jersey Department of Transportation</a> as part of US 1 Bus., despite not being officially recognized as such. Signage in Pennsylvania no longer exists; most of the former US 1 Alternate is now part of <a href="Pennsylvania_Route_32" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Route 32</a> (PA 32). US 1 Alt. was created in 1953 after US 1 was moved to a freeway between Morrisville and the Brunswick Circle. By the 1980s, when the Trenton Freeway was extended to its current terminus, US 1 Bus. was created onto its current alignment and US 1 Alt. was removed through Trenton and Morrisville.</p>

The road heads north as a four-lane <a href="divided_highway" title="wikilink">divided highway</a> before making a turn to the northwest.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The route becomes four-lane undivided Strawberry Street and passes through residential areas.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> At the border of <a href="Lawrence_Township,_Mercer_County,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Lawrence Township</a> and Trenton, the road enters the Brunswick Circle, where it junctions with northbound <a href="U.S._Route_206" title="wikilink">US 206</a> and <a href="County_Route_645_(Mercer_County,_New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">CR 645</a>. At the circle, the route turns northeast onto a four-lane divided highway and enters Lawrence Township.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The road runs through residential and commercial areas, with a few intersections controlled by <a href="jughandle" title="wikilink">jughandles</a>. US 1 Bus. has an intersection with CR 616, which heads east to provide access to US 1. Further to the northeast, the settings become more commercial before US 1 Bus. merges into northbound US 1 at the northeast end of the Trenton Freeway.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the official route beginning at US 1 near the Brunswick Circle, signage has US 1 Bus. begin at the <a href="Lower_Trenton_Bridge" title="wikilink">Lower Trenton Bridge</a> over the <a href="Delaware_River" title="wikilink">Delaware River</a>, just north of the <a href="Trenton-Morrisville_Toll_Bridge" title="wikilink">Trenton-Morrisville Toll Bridge</a> (US 1). The continuation into Pennsylvania is State Route 2060 to the <a href="Pennsylvania_Route_32" title="wikilink">PA 32</a> intersection in <a href="Morrisville,_Bucks_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Morrisville</a>. From the bridge, US 1 Bus. signage heads northeast on Bridge Street, with the road curving north onto Warren Street into downtown Trenton. At Livingston Street, the road becomes a <a href="one-way_pair" title="wikilink">one-way pair</a> following Warren Street southbound and Broad Street northbound, <a href="concurrency_(road)" title="wikilink">concurrent</a> with US 206. At the south end of <a href="New_Jersey_Route_31" title="wikilink">Route 31</a>, the one-way pair becomes Brunswick Avenue northbound and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard southbound, heading northeast. These two roads are two-way, but carry only one direction of US 1 Bus./US 206. The one-way pair continues to the Brunswick Circle, where the official US 1 Bus. continues north. Strawberry Street is signed &quot;to US 1 south&quot; from the circle, and as US 1 Business north from US 1. Southbound US 1 Bus. leaves the circle with US 206 southbound on <a href="Brunswick_Circle_Extension" title="wikilink">Brunswick Circle Extension</a>, merging with Princeton Avenue (<a href="County_Route_583_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">CR 583</a>). Officially, Brunswick Circle Extension is CR 645 and US 206 southbound bypasses the circle via Princeton Avenue, but all signage points US 206 through the circle. Northbound US 1 Business and US 206 simply enter the circle from Brunswick Avenue.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
