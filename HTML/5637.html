<h2 id="story">Story</h2>
<p>We start at what seems like a small house. Mickey walks out the door and says, &quot;Oh boy! What a day!&quot;. Then, he pulls a lever and walks inside. The house is converted into a trailer and Goofy's car is released from the side. Then, Goofy starts driving through the countryside while Mickey makes breakfast (corn on the cob, baked potatoes, watermelon, coffee, and milk). Meanwhile, Donald can't wake up. Thanks to a secret controlboard, Mickey manages to wake him up and gives Donald a bath. Later, the bath area is converted into the kitchen. After Mickey rings the dinner bell, Goofy foolishly leaves the driver's seat for breakfast. After several mishaps at breakfast and almost causing the trailer to fall off the road, Goofy accidentally unhitches the trailer in panic and goes on his way. The trailer crashes in several places and is a wreck by the time it's rehitched. Goofy says in the end, &quot;Well, I brought you down safe and sound.&quot;</p>
