<p>The season revolves around the character of <a href="Phil_Coulson" title="wikilink">Phil Coulson</a>, with <a href="Clark_Gregg" title="wikilink">Clark Gregg</a> reprising his role from the film series, and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, who are assigned to several dangerous cases. The cases revolve around Project Centipede and its leader, <a href="John_Garrett_(comics)" title="wikilink">The Clairvoyant</a>, while Coulson also searches for answers concerning his mysterious resurrection after dying in <em><a href="The_Avengers_(2012_film)" title="wikilink">The Avengers</a></em>. Several other characters from MCU films and <a href="Marvel_One-Shots" title="wikilink">Marvel One-Shots</a> also appear throughout the season, with some episodes directly crossing over with the films <em><a href="Thor:_The_Dark_World" title="wikilink">Thor: The Dark World</a></em> and <em><a href="Captain_America:_The_Winter_Soldier" title="wikilink">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a></em>.

<p>The <a href="Pilot_(Agents_of_S.H.I.E.L.D.)" title="wikilink">series premiere</a> was watched by 12.12 million viewers, the highest ratings received by the first episode of a drama series in the United States since the pilot episode of <em><a href="V_(2009_TV_series)" title="wikilink">V</a></em> in 2009. The season initially received a mixed reception, which also mirrored a decrease in ratings as the season progressed. However, reception grew more positive as the season progressed into its second half, which led to more consistent ratings. A <a href="Agents_of_S.H.I.E.L.D._(season_2)" title="wikilink">second season</a> began airing on ABC on September 23, 2014.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>In August 2012, it was announced that <em><a href="The_Avengers_(2012_film)" title="wikilink">Marvel's The Avengers</a></em> director <a href="Joss_Whedon" title="wikilink">Joss Whedon</a> would be involved in an upcoming project for <a href="American_Broadcast_Company" title="wikilink">ABC</a>, set within the <a href="Marvel_Cinematic_Universe" title="wikilink">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> A few weeks later, ABC ordered a pilot for a show called <em>S.H.I.E.L.D.</em>, to be written by Joss Whedon, <a href="Jed_Whedon" title="wikilink">Jed Whedon</a> and <a href="Maurissa_Tancharoen" title="wikilink">Maurissa Tancharoen</a>, directed by Joss Whedon, and executive produced by Joss Whedon, Jed Whedon, Tancharoen, <a href="Jeffrey_Bell" title="wikilink">Jeffrey Bell</a> and <a href="Jeph_Loeb" title="wikilink">Jeph Loeb</a>. Jed Whedon, Tancharoen and Bell were slated to serve as the series' <a href="showrunner" title="wikilink">showrunners</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In April 2013, ABC announced that the show would be titled <em>Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em>,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and it was officially picked up to series in May.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> On October 10, 2013, ABC announced that it had ordered a full season of 22 episodes.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>

<p>In July 2013, Maurissa Tancharoen revealed that Joss Whedon, Jed Whedon, Jeff Bell, <a href="Paul_Zbyszewski" title="wikilink">Paul Zbyszewski</a>, <a href="Monica_Owusu-Breen" title="wikilink">Monica Owusu-Breen</a>, <a href="Brent_Fletcher" title="wikilink">Brent Fletcher</a>, Lauren LeFranc, <a href="Rafe_Judkins" title="wikilink">Rafe Judkins</a>, and Shalisha Francis would be the writers for the season.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>All the episodes were written with the knowledge that S.H.I.E.L.D. would be destroyed in <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em>, with Jed Whedon saying &quot;It&lt;U+2019&gt;s the kind of thing that if someone told you that concept, you&lt;U+2019&gt;d think it was a great thing to have happen at the beginning of the show or the end of Season 3. To have it happen in the middle of your first season is an interesting kind of riddle because we had to quickly establish what a regular day at S.H.I.E.L.D. looks like, what [is] it like to go on a mission, say here&lt;U+2019&gt;s the team, and that there are also different teams all over the world. Then to blow that up, we knew the way to best illustrate that was by putting it on a personal level with our main man Coulson and to put him through the paces as a man dedicated to an organization.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Tancharoen elaborated that &quot;We see what it actually looks like for S.H.I.E.L.D. to crumble in <em>Captain America 2</em>, we see the <a href="Helicarrier" title="wikilink">Helicarriers</a> literally barreling through the <a href="Triskelion_(comics)" title="wikilink">Triskelion</a>, we see the massive destruction throughout the city, but the benefit of our show is we get to dive into the emotional toll of that. To build our characters up to a point where they have established a bond, and they are working together in a way they&lt;U+2019&gt;ve never worked together before, and to strip away the foundation that they&lt;U+2019&gt;ve dedicated their lives to and the trust they&lt;U+2019&gt;ve now laid with one another, it&lt;U+2019&gt;s a really fun thing to play.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>From the beginning it was decided that one of the main characters would be a traitor, with Jed Whedon saying &quot;When we started conceptualizing the show with Joss, knowing [<em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em>] was coming, we knew there would have to be some sort of personal toll, and there&lt;U+2019&gt;s the version of it where someone gets injured, but since this is an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to have it on the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The individual character arcs were laid out by the series' creative team, with Marvel's only initial guidelines being to work around <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>On whether it was Marvel's idea or the showrunner's idea to have Coulson promoted to Director and tasked with rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D. at the end of the season, Jed Whedon said &quot;They&lt;U+2019&gt;re one in the same. They have plans for films, and we have plans to intermingle with them, and it&lt;U+2019&gt;s the name of our show. The second to last episode is called &quot;Ragtag&quot;, and that&lt;U+2019&gt;s a term we&lt;U+2019&gt;ve used; we wanted to create this ragtag group, but within this giant organization with billions of dollars and support all over the globe and satellite feeds on their luxurious plane. Now we have a chance to start them over and figure out what it&lt;U+2019&gt;s like to really be a secret again.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

Then when he came up as an actual possibility, we couldn't believe it.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In February, B.J.

<p>In January 2013, <a href="Cobie_Smulders" title="wikilink">Cobie Smulders</a>, who played agent <a href="Maria_Hill" title="wikilink">Maria Hill</a> in <em>The Avengers</em>, said that her character may make an appearance in the show and that her commitment to <em><a href="How_I_Met_Your_Mother" title="wikilink">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> would not prevent her from participating.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Smulders reprised her role as Maria Hill in the pilot, with Joss Whedon saying, &quot;I wanted very much to have Cobie in the pilot because as much as anyone else, she <em>is</em> S.H.I.E.L.D. She's cool and commanding, and has the dry humor that plays so well with Clark's.&quot;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Smulders returned once again in the role in the episode &quot;Nothing Personal&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> In June 2013, <a href="Samuel_L._Jackson" title="wikilink">Samuel L.

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p><a href="Storyboards" class="uri" title="wikilink">Storyboards</a> were used throughout the season, to &quot;put the director, stunts, camera, FX and the crew on the same page&quot;, though Joss Whedon did not use them for the pilot. One of the storyboard artists, Warren Drummond, noted the process was different to that on films, because there was limited time to complete the work, and because the storyboard artists were often working with different directors for each episode. Most of the sequences storyboarded were action or science fiction sequences.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The main recurring setting for the season is the Bus, a retrofitted <a href="Boeing_C-17" title="wikilink">Boeing C-17</a>, that serves as both the transportation and headquarters of the titular team. The Bus includes such features as a soundproof interrogation room, a forensics and research lab located on the lower deck, where Fitz and Simmons work, and a cargo hold directly outside the lab where the team parks its SUV and Lola, Coulson's prized <a href="Chevy_Corvette" title="wikilink">1962 Corvette</a>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="filming">Filming</h3>
<p>The pilot was produced almost entirely in <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> to accommodate Joss Whedon's busy schedule.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Subsequent episodes were also produced in Los Angeles,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> as well as <a href="Culver_City,_California" title="wikilink">Culver City, California</a>,<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> though additional filming took place around the world, including in <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a>, <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, for &quot;<a href="Pilot_(Agents_of_S.H.I.E.L.D.)" title="wikilink">Pilot</a>&quot;,<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> and in <a href="Stockholm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stockholm</a>, <a href="Sweden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sweden</a>, for &quot;<a href="Eye_Spy_(Agents_of_S.H.I.E.L.D.)" title="wikilink">Eye Spy</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>The stunt coordinator for the season was Tanner Gill.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> In September 2013, Ming-Na Wen talked about stunts and action scenes on the series, saying &quot;I train. I work out and I have great stunt coordinators and choreographers to help me through every step and with the magic of filmmaking and editing, it all brings about her skills, to another level. That has to be very believable ... I think the hardest part is doing the actual stunts, the stunt-fighting. That's a whole other thing. I'm not really punching out the stunt guy, nor are they hitting me, so it's learning this dance, really, within the fight. It's how to pull back, how to take a hit and make it look real.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>As with many Marvel projects, secrecy was a big issue. For instance, it was a challenge keeping Samuel L. Jackson's cameo in &quot;<a href="0-8-4" class="uri" title="wikilink">0-8-4</a>&quot; a surprise due to &quot;this age of tweets and spoilers&quot;.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> The showrunners had been exposed to this while working on <em>The Avengers</em>, but with their own series they were able to see &quot;all the details that go into keeping everything under lock and key&quot;.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="visual-effects">Visual effects</h3>
<p>The visual effects supervisor for the season was Mark Kolpack,<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> with Los Angeles-based visual effects company FuseFX the main visual effects vendor. David Altenau was the in-house VFX supervisor for &quot;Pilot&quot; and the first 8 episodes, with Matt Von Brock overseeing the computer generated imagery on the show. Kevin Lingenfelser started the season focused on 2D supervising, but took over as lead in-house visual effects supervisor after episode 8. Two separate production management and creative teams were established to work on the show, and though creative leadership stayed consistent during the series, producers, compositors and various artists were able to alternate episodes. This was important because most of the episodes had to be worked on concurrently, either two or three at a time.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

The digital model used in the series was designed and created by FuseFX.|alt=Digital model of &quot;the Bus&quot; from the series." width="250" /> For the Bus, Altenau explained that it &quot;has all kinds of S.H.I.E.L.D. technology that is revealed over time as the series progresses. This includes an extra wing and engines in the rear giving the plane the ability to operate vertically for take-offs and landings, and even mid-flight u-turns ... FuseFX was given the opportunity to design the Bus. The design included many features from the start, such as the ability to do vertical take-offs and landing&quot;. FuseFX designed the Bus, and &quot;Extreme attention was paid when designing the textures and rigging for this asset. Half a dozen 8k maps make up the details on the plane which allows the camera to get right up to the surface of the plane without any loss of detail. A very complex rig controls every aspect of the plane from the landing gear, engine transformation, doors opening, lighting and even the wings have flex controls for the animators to sell the weight of this massive aircraft. When the engines are in vertical flight mode they have several degrees of rotation which gives the jet a lot of maneuvering ability.&quot;<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>FuseFX also worked on Lola, Coulson&lt;U+2019&gt;s &quot;vintage 1962 Corvette&quot; which was described as &quot;a classic car and beautiful in its own right, but through digital effects, Fuse has added hovercraft capabilities. When Coulson needs it, the wheel&lt;U+2019&gt;s rotate into a horizontal position, exposing hidden jet engine ducts that create lifting thrust through the rims of the tires, which double as turbo-fan blades. We worked closely with production to help design the mechanism and the look of the hovercraft engines. It&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="Stark_Industries" title="wikilink">Stark</a> technology designed to be consistent with the period aspect of the car.&quot;<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> When the real Corvette is shown transitioning to its hover mode, volumetric dust, exhaust, and particle effects are added. Occasionally, FuseFX was required to use a fully digital model of the car, which matches the real vehicle precisely.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

<p>In June 2013, Clark Gregg explained how the series would tie into the <a href="List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films" title="wikilink">Marvel Cinematic Universe films</a>: &quot;...the exciting part is going to be seeing the way that <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> interacts with the S.H.I.E.L.D. component in <em><a href="Captain_America:_The_Winter_Soldier" title="wikilink">Captain America 2</a></em>, and the other movies, and whether those movies will then affect our show.&quot;<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Joss Whedon did state that the show would be autonomous from <em>The Avengers</em>, saying &quot;It&lt;U+2019&gt;s gotta be a show that works for people who haven&lt;U+2019&gt;t seen the Marvel movies. It will please Marvel fans, I think.&quot;<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> He reiterated that sentiment in an interview at the 2012 <a href="Toronto_International_Film_Festival" title="wikilink">Toronto International Film Festival</a>, explaining &quot;It's new characters.

And that, to me, is that they're not superheroes, but they live in that universe.

The characters face the Hydra issue head on, while experiencing trust issues within themselves. Jed Whedon added that the Hydra element, which the show could not mention until after the release of <em>The Winter Soldier</em> in order to avoid spoiling the film, also attempts to address the lack of characters from the comics, a complaint fans had throughout the season, while also tying established threats such as the Clairvoyant, Project Centipede, and Deathlok, back into Hydra.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>

The website's consensus reads, &quot;<em>Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> is sure to please comic book fans, but the strong ensemble and brisk pacing help to make this better-than-average superhero show accessible to non-fanboys as well.&quot;<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> <a href="Metacritic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metacritic</a>, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 74 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews.&quot;<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>
<p>The early screening of the pilot at San Diego Comic-Con International was met with a very positive reaction from the crowd.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> Critically, the initial screening of the pilot was met with mostly positive reviews, though <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em>{{'}} Brooks Barnes noted that &quot;what goes over well at Comic-Con does not necessarily work in the real world,&quot; especially on a network with &quot;<em><a href="Scandal_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Scandal</a></em> moms and <em><a href="Dancing_with_the_Stars_(U.S._TV_series)" title="wikilink">Dancing with the Stars</a></em> grandparents&quot;.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em>{{'}}s initial reactions were that if everything that made the show appealing— its continuity with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, its continuance of <em>The Avengers</em> storyline, and Whedon's return to television, were stripped from it, the show would still work. However, they also questioned whether the show was accessible enough to attract a wider audience.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>
<p>Evan Valentine, writing for Collider, divided the season into highs and lows: highs included the <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em> crossover, with Valentine noting that &quot;The creators had clearly known this moment was coming ... and did a great job of capitalizing [on] it,&quot; as well as other tie-ins with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and he praised Gregg's performance, stating &quot;What made us fall in love with the character from the first <em>Iron Man</em> to his death in <em>The Avengers</em> is still alive and kicking&quot;; lows of the season included the episodes before the <em>Winter Soldier</em> tie-in, with Valentine feeling that the series &quot;became the show that had to stall its developments and character building to make way for the [tie-in].&quot; He also criticized the rest of the main cast, though he did approve of the guest and supporting cast members, and he criticized the series' use of minor comic book characters and concepts, singling out the costume design for Deathlok as &quot;horrid&quot; and not scary.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
<p>Eric Goldman of <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> gave the season a 7.5 out of 10, calling it &quot;a fun, lighthearted, but fairly disposable piece of entertainment&quot;, noting that it improved through the season, especially following the <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em> tie-in, and that by the end of the season, the series &quot;was starting to come into its own&quot;. Though he found the main cast's performances to all be good, and praised the strong guest and recurring stars, Goldman found the main characterizations to be weak during the first half of the season, and he also criticized the pacing of certain overarching plotlines, noting &quot;the mystery of Coulson&lt;U+2019&gt;s return, Skye&lt;U+2019&gt;s parentage, etc. &lt;U+2013&gt; moved far too slow, with relatively minor revelations treated as though they were big reveals&quot;.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Jim_Steranko" title="wikilink">Jim Steranko</a>, an artist and writer who worked on 18 of the <em>Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> comic books between 1966 and 1968, was critical of the pilot episode, lamenting that &quot;the show had no menace, no tension.&quot;<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> For the second episode, Steranko said that it was &quot;too unfocused to be satisfying,&quot; but praised Jackson's cameo as Nick Fury as &quot;an electrifying reminder of what the series could and should be.&quot;<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> In contrast, Steranko's opinion of some later episodes in the first season were more positive, congratulating the writer and director of &quot;The End of the Beginning&quot; for &quot;finding an entertaining, bravura groove that finally brings the concept to life&quot;,<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> and saying of the next episode &quot;I was concerned that last week&lt;U+2019&gt;s bravura transformation was only a fluke, but it was apparent from the opening moments that the exec lineup&lt;U+2019&gt;s new image-and-edit policy was in play.&quot;<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> Overall, however, he found season one to be &quot;22 episodes of 'sanctified' plot and character crumbs being salted with terminally-sluggish velocity (into anemic 'standalone' stories)&quot;.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<p>Both the way the series was affected by the destruction of S.H.I.E.L.D. in <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em> and the way its characters are depicted rebuilding the organization have been noted by some:</p>
<p>Terri Schwartz, writing for Zap2it following the airing of &quot;Nothing Personal&quot;, called the series &quot;incredible&quot;, stating that it &quot;got off to a rocky start&quot;, but that changed once the <em>Winter Soldier</em> tie-in took place. Schwartz felt that the season earned many of its early criticisms from having to &quot;bide time&quot; until the crossover, but &quot;Now that it has the freedom to be the series it was always intended to, <em>Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> has turned into a fantastic show. Its connection to Marvel's Cinematic Universe is clear: This is where viewers get to see the fallout of Hydra's S.H.I.E.L.D. infiltration. And the fact that the movie so influenced the show is game-changing in terms of how the mediums of film and television can be interwoven.&quot;<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>
<p>Merrill Barr, reviewing &quot;Beginning of the End&quot; for <em><a href="Forbes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Forbes</a></em>, reiterated this sentiment, stating that &quot;the series finally stands its ground and stakes its claim as a member of the Marvel Cinematic Universe ... By establishing world changing consequences that don&lt;U+2019&gt;t just affect one MCU franchise, but all of them.&quot; He continues saying that &quot;what Marvel&lt;U+2019&gt;s daring to say with this season finale is &lt;U+201C&gt;everything we do matters, and you need to pay attention to all of it.&lt;U+201D&gt; ... It&lt;U+2019&gt;s been a long journey, and there&lt;U+2019&gt;s no question many viewers&lt;U+2019&gt; patience wore thin toward the end, but that never stopped Marvel from pushing forward to one of the most entertaining hours of television this season and finally cementing a deserved place on the small screen.&quot;<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a></p>
<p>Mary McNamara of the <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em> felt that the series &quot;created a whole new sort of television show: One that must support, and change with, the plot twists of its film family ... never before has television been literally married to film, charged with filling in the back story and creating the connective tissue of an ongoing film franchise.&quot; She stated that the <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em> crossover &quot;infused <em>S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> with a new energy, and helped explain, perhaps, why the show took so long to find its footing &lt;U+2014&gt; in the writers' room at least ... That <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> was able to succeed as a story both independent and ancillary is all but miraculous.&quot; She concluded that the series &quot;is now not only a very good show in its own right, it's part of Marvel's multiplatform city-state. It faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that puts it in the exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination.&quot;<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a></p>
