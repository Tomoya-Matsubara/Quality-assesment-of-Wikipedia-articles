<p>The  is a subterranean <a href="Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> <a href="art_museum" title="wikilink">art museum</a> located on Nakanoshima, an island between the <a href="D&lt;U+014D&gt;jima_River" title="wikilink">D&lt;U+014D&gt;jima River</a> and the <a href="Tosabori_River" title="wikilink">Tosabori River</a> about 5 minutes west of <a href="Higobashi_Station" title="wikilink">Higobashi Station</a> in central <a href="Osaka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Osaka</a>. The exhibits mainly consist of modern art both from Japan and abroad, but other temporary exhibits are also held.</p>
<p>Its Japanese name translates as the &quot;National Museum of International Art&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The museum originates from the Expo Art Gallery which was built as part of Expo '70, held in <a href="Suita" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suita</a> in the outskirts of Osaka. The site was converted into Expo Memorial Park after the Expo, but the gallery was preserved for possible future use as a permanent art museum. It re-opened in 1977 as the National Museum of Art, as part of Expo Memorial Park. Due to the aging of the building as well as growing space limitations, the museum was temporarily closed in January 2004. The old museum was demolished and turned into a car park, while the exhibits were transferred to its more central, current location in Nakanoshima, which opened in November 2004.</p>
<h2 id="the-museum">The Museum</h2>
<p>The present museum was designed by <a href="C&lt;U+00E9&gt;sar_Pelli" title="wikilink">C&lt;U+00E9&gt;sar Pelli</a>, an architect headquartered in Connecticut, USA. Interestingly, most of the museum facilities are located underground, next to the <a href="Osaka_Science_Museum" title="wikilink">Osaka Science Museum</a>. The entrance, auditorium, restaurant and the museum shop is located just beneath ground level, with exhibits and storage facilities on two floors beneath. Various temporary exhibitions held by newspaper firms, which are not limited to modern art, are held on the bottom floor, with the permanent exhibitions and artist-focused temporary exhibits on the intermediate floor. Pelli suggested that the designon the most upper level represented waving reeds in the wind.</p>
