<p><strong>Johannesburg</strong> () also known as <strong>Jozi</strong> or <strong>Jo'burg</strong>, is the largest city in <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africa</a>. Johannesburg is the <a href="province" title="wikilink">provincial</a> <a href="Capital_(political)" title="wikilink">capital</a> of <a href="Gauteng" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gauteng</a>, the wealthiest province in South Africa, having the largest economy of any metropolitan region in <a href="Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="wikilink">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>. The city is one of the 40 largest <a href="metropolitan_area" title="wikilink">metropolitan areas</a> in the world<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and it is one of Africa's only six <a href="global_city" title="wikilink">global cities</a>, the other being <a href="Cairo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cairo</a>, <a href="Cape_Town" title="wikilink">Cape Town</a>, <a href="Casablanca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Casablanca</a>, <a href="Nairobi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nairobi</a> and <a href="Port_Louis" title="wikilink">Port Louis</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. While Johannesburg is not officially one of <a href="South_Africa#Politics" title="wikilink">South Africa's three capital cities</a>, it does house the <a href="Constitutional_Court_of_South_Africa" title="wikilink">Constitutional Court</a> South Africa's highest court.</p>
<p>Johannesburg is the source of a large-scale <a href="gold" class="uri" title="wikilink">gold</a> and <a href="diamond" class="uri" title="wikilink">diamond</a> <a href="trade" class="uri" title="wikilink">trade</a>, due to its location on the <a href="mineral" class="uri" title="wikilink">mineral</a>-rich <a href="Witwatersrand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Witwatersrand</a> range of hills. Johannesburg is served by <a href="O.R._Tambo_International_Airport" title="wikilink">O.R. Tambo International Airport</a>, the largest and busiest <a href="airport" class="uri" title="wikilink">airport</a> in Africa and a gateway for international air travel to and from the rest of <a href="southern_Africa" title="wikilink">southern Africa</a>.</p>
<p>According to the 2007 Community Survey, the population of the municipal city  was 3,888,180 and the population of the <a href="Greater_Johannesburg_Metropolitan_Area" title="wikilink">Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Area</a> was 7,151,447 . A broader definition of the Johannesburg <a href="metropolitan_area" title="wikilink">metropolitan area</a>, including <a href="Ekhuruleni" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ekhuruleni</a>, the <a href="West_Rand" title="wikilink">West Rand</a>, <a href="Soweto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Soweto</a> and <a href="Lenasia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lenasia</a>, has a population of 10,267,700 . The municipal city's land area of  is very large when compared to other cities, resulting in a moderate <a href="population_density" title="wikilink">population density</a> of .</p>
<p>Johannesburg once again includes <a href="Soweto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Soweto</a>, which was a separate city from the late 1970s until the 1990s. Originally an acronym for &quot;SOuth-WEstern TOwnships&quot;, Soweto originated as a collection of settlements on the outskirts of Johannesburg populated mostly by native African workers in the gold mining industry. Eventually incorporated into Johannesburg, the <a href="apartheid" class="uri" title="wikilink">apartheid</a> regime (in power 1949 - 1994) separated Soweto from the rest of Johannesburg to make it a completely Black area. <a href="Lenasia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lenasia</a> is also part of Johannesburg.</p>
<p><a href="Gauteng" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gauteng</a> is growing rapidly due to mass urbanisation which is a feature of many <a href="Developing_country" title="wikilink">developing countries</a>. According to the State of the Cities Report, the urban portion of Gauteng comprised primarily of the cities of Johannesburg, <a href="Ekurhuleni" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ekurhuleni</a> (the <a href="East_Rand" title="wikilink">East Rand</a>) and <a href="Tshwane" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tshwane</a> (greater <a href="Pretoria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pretoria</a>) will be a <a href="Conurbation" title="wikilink">polycentric urban region</a> with a projected population of some 14.6 million people by 2015.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p><img src="langlaagte.jpg" title="fig:The farm where gold was first discovered in 1886." alt="The farm where gold was first discovered in 1886." /> The region surrounding Johannesburg was originally inhabited by <a href="San_(tribe)" title="wikilink">San tribes</a>. By the 1200s, groups of <a href="Bantu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bantu</a>-speaking peoples started moving southwards from central Africa and encroached on the indigenous San population. By the mid 1700s, the broader region was densely settled by various <a href="Sotho-Tswana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sotho-Tswana</a> communities (one linguistic branch of Bantu-speakers), whose villages, towns, chiefdoms and kingdoms stretched from what is now <a href="Botswana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Botswana</a> in the west, to present day <a href="Lesotho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lesotho</a> in the south, to the present day <a href="Northern_Sotho_language" title="wikilink">Pedi</a> areas of the northern Transvaal.  More specifically, the stone-walled ruins of <a href="Sotho-Tswana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sotho-Tswana</a> towns and villages are scattered around the parts of the former Transvaal in which Johannesburg is situated. The Sotho-Tswana practiced farming, raised cattle, sheep and goats, and extensively mined and smelted copper, iron and tin. Moreover, from the early 1960s until his retirement, Professor Revil Mason, of the <a href="University_of_the_Witwatersrand" title="wikilink">University of the Witwatersrand</a>, explored and documented many Late <a href="Iron_Age" title="wikilink">Iron Age</a> archeological sites throughout the Johannesburg area, dating from between the 1100s and 1700s, and many of these sites contained the ruins of Sotho-Tswana mines and iron smelting furnaces, suggesting that the area was being exploited for its mineral wealth before the arrival of Europeans or the discovery of gold. The most prominent site within Johannesburg is <a href="Melville,_Gauteng" title="wikilink">Melville</a> Koppies, which contains an iron smelting furnace. Many Sotho-Tswana towns and villages in the areas around Johannesburg were destroyed and their people driven away during the wars emanating from <a href="Zulu_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Zululand</a> during the late 1700s and early 1800s (the mfecane or difaqane wars), and as a result, an offshoot of the Zulu kingdom, the <a href="Ndebele_people_(Zimbabwe)" title="wikilink">Matabele</a>, set up a kingdom to the northwest of Johannesburg around modern day <a href="Hartbeespoort,_North_West" title="wikilink">Hartebeestpoort</a> and <a href="Rustenburg,_North_West" title="wikilink">Rustenburg</a>, and historians believe that the Matebele kingdom dominated the Johannesburg area. The Dutch speaking <a href="Voortrekkers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Voortrekkers</a> arrived in the early 1800s, driving away the Matebele with the help of Sotho-Tswana allies, establishing settlements around Rustenburg and Pretoria in the early 1830s, and claiming sovereignty over what would become Johannesburg as part of the South African Republic or Transvaal Republic. <a href="Gold" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gold</a> was discovered in the 1880s and triggered the <a href="Witwatersrand_Gold_Rush" title="wikilink">gold rush</a>. Gold was initially discovered some 400 km to the east of present-day Johannesburg, in <a href="Barberton,_South_Africa" title="wikilink">Barberton</a>. <a href="Prospecting" title="wikilink">Gold prospectors</a> soon discovered that there were even richer gold reefs in the <a href="Witwatersrand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Witwatersrand</a>. Gold was discovered at Langlaagte, Johannesburg in 1886.</p>
<p>Johannesburg was a dusty settlement some 55 km from the Transvaal Republic capital which was <a href="Pretoria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pretoria</a>. The town was much the same as any small prospecting settlement, but, as word spread, people flocked to the area from all other regions of the country, as well as from North America, the United Kingdom and Europe.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. As the value of control of the land increased, tensions developed between the <a href="Boer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boer</a> government in Pretoria and the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a>, culminating in the <a href="Jameson_Raid" title="wikilink">Jameson Raid</a> that ended in fiasco at <a href="Doornkop" class="uri" title="wikilink">Doornkop</a> in January 1896 and the <a href="Second_Boer_War" title="wikilink">Second Boer War</a> (1899-1902) that saw British forces under <a href="Lord_Roberts" title="wikilink">Lord Roberts</a> occupy the city on 30 May 1900 after a series of battles to the south of its then-limits.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_remository&amp;Itemid=401&amp;func=select&amp;id=5/">Fighting took place</a> at the Gatsrand Pass (near Zakariyya Park) on 27 May, north of Vanwyksrust -today's Nancefield, Eldorado Park and Naturena - the next day, culminating in a mass infantry attack on what is now the waterworks ridge in Chiawelo and Senaoane on 29 May.</p>
<p>Controversy surrounds the origin of the name, as there were any number of people with the name &quot;Johannes&quot; who were involved in the early history of the city. The principal clerk attached to the office of the surveyor-general, Johannes Rissik, Christiaan Johannes Joubert, member of the <a href="Volksraad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Volksraad</a> and the Republic's chief of mining, <a href="Paul_Kruger" title="wikilink">Paul Kruger</a>, President of the Zuid Afrikaansche Republiek (<a href="Transvaal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transvaal</a>). Rissik and Joubert were members of a delegation sent to England to attain mining rights for the area. Joubert had a park in the city named after him and Rissik street is today a main street where the (now dilapidated) Post Office and City Hall are located.</p>

The white authorities were 90% self-sufficient from <a href="property_tax" title="wikilink">property tax</a> and other local <a href="tax" title="wikilink">taxes</a>, and spent <a href="South_African_Rand" title="wikilink">ZAR</a> 600 (<a href="USD" class="uri" title="wikilink">USD</a> 93) per person, while the black authorities were only 10% self-sufficient, spending R 100 (USD 15) per person. </p>
<p>The first post-apartheid City Council was created in 1995. The council adopted the slogan &quot;One City, One Taxpayer&quot; in order to highlight its primary goal of addressing unequal tax revenue distribution. To this end, revenue from wealthy, traditionally white areas would help pay for services needed in poorer, black areas. The City Council was divided into four regions, each with a <a href="autonomous_region" title="wikilink">substantially autonomous</a> local regional authority that was to be overseen by a central metropolitan council. Furthermore, the municipal boundaries were expanded to include wealthy satellite towns like <a href="Sandton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sandton</a> and <a href="Randburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Randburg</a>, poorer neighbouring townships such as <a href="Soweto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Soweto</a> and <a href="Alexandra,_South_Africa" title="wikilink">Alexandra</a>, and informal settlements like <a href="Orange_Farm" title="wikilink">Orange Farm</a>.</p>
<p>In 1999, Johannesburg appointed a city manager in order to reshape the city's ailing financial situation.  The manager, together with the Municipal Council, drew up a blueprint called &quot;Igoli 2002&quot;. This was a three-year plan that called upon the government to sell non-core assets, restructure certain utilities, and required that all others become self-sufficient. The plan took the city from near <a href="insolvency" class="uri" title="wikilink">insolvency</a> to an operating <a href="surplus" class="uri" title="wikilink">surplus</a> of R 153 million (USD 23.6 million). </p>
<p>Following the creation of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, Johannesburg was divided into eleven administrative regions (these regions did not correspond to the areas governed by the former local authorities). In 2006, the number of administrative regions was consolidated, from eleven to seven.<a href="http://joburgnews.co.za/citichat/2006/apr10_citichat11.stm">1</a></p>
<h2 id="crime">Crime</h2>
<p>After the <a href="Group_Areas_Act" title="wikilink">Group Areas Act</a> was scrapped in 1991, Johannesburg was affected by <a href="urban_blight" title="wikilink">urban blight</a>. Thousands of poor, mostly black people, who had been forbidden to live in the city proper, moved into the city from surrounding black townships like <a href="Soweto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Soweto</a> and many immigrants from economically beleaguered and war torn African nations flooded into South Africa, with Johannesburg the most Northerly major city and therein a logical choice. Many buildings were abandoned by <a href="landlord" title="wikilink">landlords</a>, especially in high-density areas, such as <a href="Hillbrow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hillbrow</a>. Many corporations and institutions, including the <a href="JSE_Securities_Exchange" title="wikilink">stock exchange</a>, moved their headquarters away from the city centre, to suburbs like <a href="Sandton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sandton</a>.</p>
<p>Reviving the city centre is one of the main aims of the municipal government of Johannesburg. Drastic measures have been taken to reduce crime in the city. These measures include <a href="closed-circuit_television" title="wikilink">closed-circuit television</a> on street corners. As of December 11 2008, every street corner in Johannesburg central is under high-tech <a href="Closed-circuit_television" title="wikilink">CCTV</a> surveillance.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The CCTV system, operated by the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD), is also able to detect stolen or hijacked vehicles by scanning the number plates of every vehicle traveling through the <a href="Central_business_district" title="wikilink">Central business district</a> (CBD), then comparing them to the eNaTIS database. The CCTV system has proven to be very effective. The average response time by police for crimes committed in the CBD is under 60 seconds.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Crime levels in Johannesburg have dropped as the economy has stabilised and begun to grow.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Between 2001 and 2006, R9-Billion (US$1.2 Billion) has been invested in the city centre.

This excludes development directly associated with the 2010 FIFA World Cup.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In an effort to prepare Johannesburg for the <a href="2010_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2010 FIFA World Cup</a>, local government has enlisted the help of former New York mayor <a href="Rudolph_Giuliani" title="wikilink">Rudolph Giuliani</a> to help bring down the crime rate, as the opening and closing matches of the tournament will be played in the city.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p>Johannesburg is located in the eastern plateau area of South Africa known as the <a href="Highveld" class="uri" title="wikilink">Highveld</a>, at an elevation of . The former <a href="Central_business_district" title="wikilink">CBD</a> is located on the south side of the prominent ridge called the <a href="Witwatersrand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Witwatersrand</a> (<a href="Afrikaans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afrikaans</a>: White Water's Ridge) and the terrain falls to the north and south. By and large the Witwatersrand marks the watershed between the Limpopo and Vaal rivers. The north and west of the city has undulating hills while the eastern parts are flatter.</p>
<h2 id="climate">Climate</h2>
<p>Johannesburg features a <a href="Oceanic_climate" title="wikilink">Subtropical highland climate</a>. The city enjoys a dry, sunny climate, with the exception of occasional late afternoon downpours in the summer months of October to April.  Temperatures in Johannesburg are usually fairly mild due to the city's high altitude, with the average maximum daytime temperature in January of , dropping to an average maximum of around  in June. Winter is the sunniest time of the year, with cool days and cold nights. The temperature occasionally drops to below freezing at night, causing <a href="frost" class="uri" title="wikilink">frost</a>. <a href="Snow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Snow</a> is a rare occurrence, with snowfall having been experienced in May 1956, August 1962, June 1964, September 1981 and August 2006 (light). Snow fell again on 27 June 2007,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> accumulating up to  in the southern suburbs. Regular cold fronts pass over in winter bringing very cold southerly winds but usually clear skies. The annual average rainfall is , which is mostly concentrated in the summer months. Infrequent showers occur through the course of the winter months.</p>
<p>Despite the relatively dry climate, Johannesburg has over ten million trees,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and it is now the biggest man-made forest in the world, followed by Graskop in Mpumalanga that is the second biggest.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Many trees were originally planted in the northern areas of the city at the end of the 19th century, to provide wood for the mining industry. The areas were developed by the <a href="Randlord" class="uri" title="wikilink">Randlord</a>, <a href="Hermann_Eckstein" title="wikilink">Hermann Eckstein</a>, a German immigrant, who called the forest estates Sachsenwald. The name was changed to Saxonwold, now the name of a suburb, during <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>. Early (white) residents who moved into the areas (Parkhurst, Parktown, Parkview, Westcliff, Saxonwold, Houghton Estate, Illovo, Hyde Park, Dunkeld, Melrose, Inanda, Sandhurst) now collectively referred to as the Northern Suburbs retained many of the original trees and planted new ones, with the encouragement of successive city councils. In recent years, however, a considerable number of trees have been felled, to make way for the Northern Suburbs' residential and commercial redevelopment.</p>

<h3 id="residential-areas">Residential Areas</h3>
<p>Johannesburg's residential areas range from luxurious, wooded suburbs, to shanty towns and squatter settlements. Alexandra, a township northeast of the city centre, is home to about 125,000 people. It was established by workers who migrated from rural areas in the late 1930s. Since the 1980s, large numbers of people have moved to Johannesburg in search of work. A lack of housing in the city has forced many to set up squatter settlements on the outskirts of the city. Most of these communities lack electricity and running water, and residents live in makeshift shacks made of scrap metal,board, and other discarded materials. In some settlements, such as Phola Park south of Johannesburg, town planners have attempted to build streets and provide residents with basic needs.</p>
<h2 id="economy">Economy</h2>
<p>Johannesburg is one of the world's leading financial centres <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and it is the economic and financial hub of South Africa, producing 16% of South Africa's <a href="gross_domestic_product" title="wikilink">gross domestic product</a>, and accounts for 40% of Gauteng's economic activity. In a 2007 survey conducted by MasterCard, Johannesburg ranked 47 out of 50 top cities in the world as a worldwide centre of commerce (the only city in Africa) <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>.</p>
<p><a href="Mining" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mining</a> was the foundation of the <a href="Witwatersrand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Witwatersrand</a>'s economy, but its importance is gradually declining due to dwindling reserves and service and manufacturing industries have become more significant to the city's economy. While gold mining no longer takes place within the <a href="city_limits" title="wikilink">city limits</a>, most mining companies still have their <a href="headquarters" class="uri" title="wikilink">headquarters</a> in Johannesburg. The city's manufacturing industries extend across a range of areas and there is still a reliance on heavy industries including <a href="steel" class="uri" title="wikilink">steel</a> and <a href="cement" class="uri" title="wikilink">cement</a> plants. The service and other industries include banking, IT, real estate, transport, broadcast and print media, private health care, transport and a vibrant leisure and consumer retail market.  Johannesburg has Africa's largest stock exchange, the <a href="JSE_Limited" title="wikilink">JSE</a> although it has moved out of the central business district. Due to its commercial role, the city is the seat of the provincial government and the site of a number of government branch offices, as well as consular offices and other institutions.</p>
<p>There is also a significant informal economy consisting of cash-only street traders and vendors.  The level of this economic activity is difficult to track in official statistics and it supports a sector of the population including immigrants who are not in formal employment. However, it is clear that the informal economy operating in Johannesburg is certainly one of the biggest in the world.</p>
<p>The Witwatersrand urban complex is a major consumer of water in a dry region. Its continued economic and population growth has depended on schemes to divert water from other regions of South Africa and from the highlands of <a href="Lesotho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lesotho</a>, the biggest of which is the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, but additional sources will be needed early in the 21st century.</p>
<p>The container terminal at City Deep is known to be the largest &quot;dry port&quot; in the world, with some 60% of cargo that arrives through the port of <a href="Durban" class="uri" title="wikilink">Durban</a> and <a href="Cape_Town" title="wikilink">Cape Town</a> arriving in Johannesburg. The City Deep area has been declared an IDZ (industrial development zone) by the Gauteng government, as part of the <a href="Blue_IQ_Project" title="wikilink">Blue IQ Project</a>.</p>

There are also plans to build a large shopping centre, known as the Zonk'Izizwe Shopping Resort, in <a href="Midrand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Midrand</a>. &quot;Zonk'Izizwe&quot; means &quot;All Nations&quot; in <a href="Zulu" title="wikilink">Zulu language</a>, indicating that the centre will cater to the city's diverse mix of peoples and races. Also a complex named Greenstone in Modderfontein has been opened and is intended to become the largest shopping complex in the southern hemisphere<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>.</p>

The Radiopark Centre is one of the most visible landmarks throughout the north-western suburbs." alt="The Radiopark Centre with the Sentech Tower in the background. The Radiopark Centre is one of the most visible landmarks throughout the north-western suburbs." /> The city is home to several media groups which own a number of newspaper and magazine titles. The two main print media groups are Independent Newspapers and Naspers (Media24). The electronic media is also headquartered in the greater metropolitan region. <em><a href="Beeld" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beeld</a></em> is a leading <a href="Afrikaans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afrikaans</a> newspaper for the city and the country, while the <em><a href="City_Press_(South_Africa)" title="wikilink">City Press</a></em> is a Sunday newspaper that is the third largest selling newspaper in South Africa. <em><a href="The_Sowetan" title="wikilink">The Sowetan</a></em> is one of a number of titles catering for the black market although in recent years it competes against newly arrived tabloids. The <em><a href="Mail_&amp;_Guardian" title="wikilink">Mail &amp; Guardian</a></em> is an investigative liberal newspaper while <em><a href="The_Citizen_(newspaper,_South_Africa)" title="wikilink">The Citizen</a></em> is a <a href="tabloid" class="uri" title="wikilink">tabloid</a>-style paper, and <em><a href="The_Star_(South_Africa)" title="wikilink">The Star</a></em> is a local newspaper that mostly covers <a href="Gauteng" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gauteng</a>-related issues. The <em><a href="The_Sunday_Times_(South_Africa)" title="wikilink">Sunday Times</a></em> is the most widely read national Sunday newspaper. True Love is the most widely read women's magazine, catering primarily to the up and coming middle class black female market, published by Media 24. <a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">The Times</a> is a national newspaper that covers current issues.</p>
<p>Media ownership is relatively complicated with a number of cross shareholdings which have been rationalised in recent years resulting in the movement of some ownership into the hands of black shareholders. This has been accompanied by a growth in black editorship and journalism.</p>
<p>Johannesburg has a number of regional radio stations such as <a href="YFM" class="uri" title="wikilink">YFM</a>, Metro FM, <a href="Phalaphala_FM" title="wikilink">Phalaphala FM</a>, Talk Radio 702, <a href="94.7_Highveld_Stereo" title="wikilink">Highveld Stereo</a>, <a href="5FM" class="uri" title="wikilink">5FM</a>, UJ FM and Kaya FM and Classic FM. The number of radio stations has increased in recent years as the government sold off frequencies to private companies. Johannesburg is also the headquarters of state-owned broadcaster <a href="South_African_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="wikilink">South African Broadcasting Corporation</a> and pay broadcast network Multichoice which distributes <a href="M-Net" class="uri" title="wikilink">M-Net</a> and DStv a digital satellite service, while <a href="etv_(South_Africa)" title="wikilink">eTV</a> also has a presence in the city. etv is the only other terrestrial broadcaster and it is free-to-air and funded by advertising revenue. The city has two television towers, the <a href="Hillbrow_Tower" title="wikilink">Hillbrow Tower</a> and the <a href="Sentech_Tower" title="wikilink">Sentech Tower</a>.</p>
<p>Johannesburg has 4 Major Cellular Telecommunisations operators: <a href="Vodacom" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vodacom</a>, <a href="MTN" title="wikilink">MTN Group</a>, <a href="Cell_C" title="wikilink">Cell C</a>, and <a href="Virgin_Mobile" title="wikilink">Virgin Mobile</a>.

Some consider Kwaito to be apolitical dance music because the same lyrics are typically repeated throughout the entire song and are placed over the rhythms and beats of <a href="House_music" title="wikilink">House music</a>.</p>
<p>Kwaito has touched more than the music scene in South Africa. In recent years, it has become deeply embedded in young South African culture because it represents &quot;the streets&quot;, street life, and the people who live there. As Grant Clark notes after his trip to Johannesburg, &quot;Kwaito has evolved its own street style. It's not just music, it's the way you walk, talk, dance, and of course, dress.&quot; <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="suburbs">Suburbs</h2>


<p>Johannesburg's suburbs are the product of extensive urban sprawl and are regionalised into north, south, east and west, and they generally have different personalities. While the <a href="Central_Business_District_(Johannesburg)" title="wikilink">Central Business District</a> and the immediate surrounding areas were formerly desirable living areas, the spatial accommodation of the suburbs has tended to see a flight from the city and immediate surrounds. The inner city buildings have been let out to the lower income groups and illegal immigrants and as a result abandoned buildings and crime have become a feature of inner city life. The immediate city suburbs include <a href="Yeoville,_Gauteng" title="wikilink">Yeoville</a>, a hot spot for black nightlife despite its otherwise poor reputation. The suburbs to the south of the city are mainly blue collar neighbourhoods and situated closer to some <a href="Township_(South_Africa)" title="wikilink">townships</a>. The suburbs to the west have in recent years floundered with the decline of the mining industry but have in some cases experienced some revival with properties being bought up by the black middle class. The biggest sprawl lies to the east and north. The eastern suburbs are relatively prosperous and close to various industrial zones. The northern suburbs have been the recipient of most of the flight from the inner city and some residential areas have become commercialised particularly around the area of Sandton, stretching north towards Midrand, a half way point between Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria.</p>
<p>Traditionally the northern and northwestern suburbs have been the centre for the wealthy, containing the high-end retail shops as well as several upper-class residential areas such as Hyde Park, Sandhurst, Northcliff and <a href="Houghton,_South_Africa" title="wikilink">Houghton</a>, where <a href="Nelson_Mandela" title="wikilink">Nelson Mandela</a> makes his home. The northwestern area in particular is vibrant and lively, with the mostly-black suburb of <a href="Sophiatown,_Gauteng" title="wikilink">Sophiatown</a> once centre of political activity and the Bohemian-flavoured <a href="Melville,_Gauteng" title="wikilink">Melville</a> featuring restaurants and nightlife. <a href="Auckland_Park" title="wikilink">Auckland Park</a> is home to the headquarters of the <a href="South_African_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="wikilink">South African Broadcasting Corporation</a>, <a href="AFDA" class="uri" title="wikilink">AFDA</a> (The South African School of Motion Picture and Live Performance) and the <a href="University_of_Johannesburg" title="wikilink">University of Johannesburg</a>.</p>
<p>To the southwest of the City Centre is <a href="Soweto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Soweto</a>, a mostly black urban area constructed during the apartheid regime specifically for housing African people who were then living in areas designated by the government for white settlement.</p>
<p>To the south of Johannesburg is <a href="Lenasia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lenasia</a>, a mostly Asian area which was constructed during the Apartheid era specifically to house Asians. It is closer to the city centre and smaller than Soweto.</p>

<h3 id="freeways">Freeways</h3>

<p>The fact that Johannesburg is not near a large navigable body of water has meant that ground transportation has been the most important method of transporting people and goods in and out of the city. One of Africa's most famous &quot;beltways&quot; or ring roads/orbitals is the <a href="Johannesburg_Ring_Road" title="wikilink">Johannesburg Ring Road</a>. The road is composed of three <a href="freeway" title="wikilink">freeways</a> that converge on the city, forming an  loop around it: the <a href="N3_Eastern_Bypass_(South_Africa)" title="wikilink">N3 Eastern Bypass</a>, which links Johannesburg with <a href="Durban" class="uri" title="wikilink">Durban</a>; the <a href="N1_Western_Bypass_(South_Africa)" title="wikilink">N1 Western Bypass</a>, which links Johannesburg with <a href="Pretoria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pretoria</a> and <a href="Cape_Town" title="wikilink">Cape Town</a>; and the <a href="N12_Southern_Bypass_(South_Africa)" title="wikilink">N12 Southern Bypass</a>, which links Johannesburg with <a href="Witbank" class="uri" title="wikilink">Witbank</a> and <a href="Kimberley,_Northern_Cape" title="wikilink">Kimberley</a>.

<h4 id="trains">Trains</h4>
<p>A part of the Gauteng Provincial Government's Blue IQ Project, <a href="Gautrain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gautrain</a> has make provision for the creation of a rapid <a href="railway" title="wikilink">rail</a> link, running north to south, between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and west to east between Sandton and <a href="Johannesburg_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Johannesburg International Airport</a>. Construction of the <a href="Gautrain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gautrain</a> Rapid Rail started in October 2006 and will be completed by 2011. It will consist of a number of underground stations, as well as above ground stations. Stations on the northern line include Johannesburg's Park Station, <a href="Rosebank" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rosebank</a>, <a href="Sandton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sandton</a>, <a href="Midrand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Midrand</a> and <a href="Pretoria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pretoria</a>. There will also be a line from the <a href="OR_Tambo_International_Airport" title="wikilink">OR Tambo International Airport</a> traveling to Sandton.</p>
<p>The east-west line from the airport to Sandton is planned to be operational in time for the <a href="2010_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2010 FIFA World Cup</a> in June 2010.</p>
<p>The rail system is being designed to alleviate traffic on the <a href="N1_(South_Africa)" title="wikilink">N1</a> freeway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, which records vehicle loads of up to 300,000 per day.. An extensive bus feeder system is also being implemented, which will allow access to the main stations from the outer suburbs. This will be the first new railway system that has been laid in South Africa since 1977..</p>

The BRT project, titled Rea Vaya (We are moving), aims to rid the city's roads of congestion and promote safe, efficient and reliable public transport. It will run seven days a week, from 05h00 until midnight. Bus frequencies will be between two and five minutes during peak hours, and seven and ten minutes during the off-peak. The system will operate on main roads throughout the city, running down designated median lanes. Rea Vaya will also offer additional, smaller feeder-buses to areas around each BRT station to ensure speedy connections from homes to main routes. The BRT stations will be located every 500m along each BRT route, offering ticket vending machines and live travel information. Larger BRT stations will also offer sales kiosks, bathrooms and park and ride facilities. The BRT system has been designed with other transport modes in mind, so as to ensure a smooth change from various transportation options - particularly with the <a href="Gautrain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gautrain</a>. The first phase of the BRT is intended to be up and running in time for the <a href="2010_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2010 FIFA World Cup</a>.</p>
