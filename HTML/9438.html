<p><strong>Willie Hugh Nelson</strong> (born April 30, 1933)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is an American <a href="country_music" title="wikilink">country music</a> singer-songwriter, as well as an author, poet, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album <em><a href="Shotgun_Willie" title="wikilink">Shotgun Willie</a></em> (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of <em><a href="Red_Headed_Stranger" title="wikilink">Red Headed Stranger</a></em> (1975) and <em><a href="Stardust_(Willie_Nelson_album)" title="wikilink">Stardust</a></em> (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of <a href="outlaw_country" title="wikilink">outlaw country</a>, a subgenre of country music that developed at the end of the 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the <a href="Nashville_sound" title="wikilink">Nashville sound</a>. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of <a href="biofuels" class="uri" title="wikilink">biofuels</a> and the <a href="Legality_of_cannabis" title="wikilink">legalization of marijuana</a>.</p>
<p>Born during the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a>, and raised by his grandparents, Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the <em>Bohemian Polka</em> as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the Air Force but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended <a href="Baylor_University" title="wikilink">Baylor University</a> for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. During this time, he worked as a disc jockey in Texas radio stations and a singer in <a href="honky_tonk" title="wikilink">honky tonks</a>. Nelson moved to <a href="Vancouver,_Washington" title="wikilink">Vancouver, Washington</a>, where he wrote &quot;<a href="Family_Bible_(Willie_Nelson_album)" title="wikilink">Family Bible</a>&quot; and recorded the song &quot;Lumberjack&quot; in 1956. In 1960, he signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join <a href="Ray_Price_(musician)" title="wikilink">Ray Price's</a> band as a bassist. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including &quot;<a href="Funny_How_Time_Slips_Away" title="wikilink">Funny How Time Slips Away</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Hello_Walls" title="wikilink">Hello Walls</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Pretty_Paper" title="wikilink">Pretty Paper</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="Crazy_(Willie_Nelson_song)" title="wikilink">Crazy</a>&quot;. In 1962, he recorded his first album, <em><a href="And_Then_I_Wrote" title="wikilink">And Then I Wrote</a></em>. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with <a href="RCA_Victor" title="wikilink">RCA Victor</a> and joined the <a href="Grand_Ole_Opry" title="wikilink">Grand Ole Opry</a> the following year. After mid-chart hits during the end of 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s, and the failure to succeed in music, Nelson retired in 1972 and moved to <a href="Austin,_Texas" title="wikilink">Austin, Texas</a>. The rise of the popularity of Hippie music in Austin motivated Nelson to return from retirement, performing frequently at the <a href="Armadillo_World_Headquarters" title="wikilink">Armadillo World Headquarters</a>.</p>
<p>In 1973, after signing with <a href="Atlantic_Records" title="wikilink">Atlantic Records</a>, Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as <em>Shotgun Willie</em> and <em>Phases and Stages</em>. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album, <em>Red Headed Stranger</em>. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, <em><a href="Wanted!_The_Outlaws" title="wikilink">Wanted! The Outlaws</a></em>, which he recorded with <a href="Waylon_Jennings" title="wikilink">Waylon Jennings</a>, <a href="Jessi_Colter" title="wikilink">Jessi Colter</a>, and <a href="Tompall_Glaser" title="wikilink">Tompall Glaser</a>. During the mid 1980s, while creating hit albums like <em><a href="Honeysuckle_Rose_(album)" title="wikilink">Honeysuckle Rose</a></em> and recording hit songs like &quot;<a href="On_the_Road_Again_(Willie_Nelson_song)" title="wikilink">On the Road Again</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="To_All_the_Girls_I&#39;ve_Loved_Before" title="wikilink">To All the Girls I've Loved Before</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="Pancho_&amp;_Lefty" title="wikilink">Pancho &amp; Lefty</a>&quot;, he joined the country <a href="Supergroup_(music)" title="wikilink">supergroup</a> <a href="The_Highwaymen_(country_supergroup)" title="wikilink">The Highwaymen</a>, along with fellow singers, <a href="Johnny_Cash" title="wikilink">Johnny Cash</a>, Waylon Jennings, and <a href="Kris_Kristofferson" title="wikilink">Kris Kristofferson</a>. During 1990 Nelson's assets were seized by the Internal Revenue Service, that claimed that he owed US $32,000,000. It was later discovered that his accountants, <a href="Price_Waterhouse" title="wikilink">Price Waterhouse</a> did not pay Nelson's taxes for years. The impossibility of Nelson to pay his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments made by him during the 1980s. Nelson released in 1991 <em><a href="The_IRS_Tapes:_Who&#39;ll_Buy_My_Memories?" title="wikilink">The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?</a></em>, the profits of the double album, destined to the IRS and the auction of Nelson's assets cleared his debt by 1993. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively, and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. Nelson explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk. Nelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film, <em><a href="The_Electric_Horseman" title="wikilink">The Electric Horseman</a></em>, followed by other appearances in movies and on television.</p>
<p>Nelson is a major liberal activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the <a href="National_Organization_for_the_Reform_of_Marijuana_Laws" title="wikilink">National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws</a>, which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the bio-diesel brand <a href="Willie_Nelson_Biodiesel" title="wikilink">Willie Nelson Biodiesel</a>, which is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the Advisory Board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas. </p>

The Nelson family had moved from <a href="Arkansas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arkansas</a> in 1929, looking for work. Nelson's grandfather, William, worked as a blacksmith, while his father worked as a mechanic.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> His mother left soon after he was born,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and his father remarried and moved away, leaving the grandparents, who both studied music at night via a mail-order course, to bring up Nelson and his sister Bobbie.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Nelson's grandfather bought him a guitar when he was six, and taught him a few chords;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and with his sister Bobbie he sang gospel songs in the local church.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He wrote his first song when he was seven,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and played the guitar for the local band <em>Bohemian Polka</em> at age nine. During the summer, like most of Abbott's inhabitants, the family picked cotton. As Nelson didn't like picking cotton, starting at age thirteen and continuing through high school, he earned money by singing in local dance halls, taverns, and honky tonks. Nelson was influenced musically during his childhood by <a href="Hank_Williams" title="wikilink">Hank Williams</a>, <a href="Lefty_Frizzell" title="wikilink">Lefty Frizzell</a>, <a href="Ernest_Tubb" title="wikilink">Ernest Tubb</a>, <a href="Django_Reinhardt" title="wikilink">Django Reinhardt</a>, <a href="Ray_Price_(musician)" title="wikilink">Ray Price</a>, and <a href="Hank_Snow" title="wikilink">Hank Snow</a>.</p>
<p>Nelson attended <a href="Abbott_High_School" title="wikilink">Abbott High School</a> where, as well as raising pigs for the <a href="National_FFA_Organization" title="wikilink">Future Farmers of America organization</a>, he was a halfback in the school <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">football</a> team, and also played basketball as a guard, and as a shortstop in baseball. While still at school he sang and played guitar in <em>The Texans</em>, a band formed by his sister's husband, Bud Fletcher. After leaving school in 1950 he joined the United States Air Force for eight to nine months,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> then worked as a disc jockey at local radio stations. He had short stints with <a href="KHBR_(AM)" title="wikilink">KHBR</a> in <a href="Hillsboro,_Texas" title="wikilink">Hillsboro, Texas</a> and later with <a href="KWMF" title="wikilink">KBOP</a> in <a href="Pleasanton,_Texas" title="wikilink">Pleasanton, Texas</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In 1952, he married Martha Matthews, and from 1954 to 1956 studied agriculture at <a href="Baylor_University" title="wikilink">Baylor University</a>,</p>
<p>Nelson joined the <a href="Tau_Kappa_Epsilon" title="wikilink">Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> but dropped out to pursue success in music.</p>

<h3 id="beginnings-1956u20131972">Beginnings (1956&lt;U+2013&gt;1972)</h3>
<p>In 1956, Nelson moved to <a href="Vancouver,_Washington" title="wikilink">Vancouver, Washington</a> to begin his formal musical career. His first record, &quot;No Place For Me&quot; included <a href="Leon_Payne" title="wikilink">Leon Payne</a>'s &quot;Lumberjack&quot; on the b-side,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> but was not successful. Nelson continued working as a radio announcer and singing in Vancouver clubs. He sold the song &quot;Family Bible&quot; for US$50 to a guitar instructor, and the song turned into a hit for <a href="Claude_Gray" title="wikilink">Claude Gray</a> in 1960. Nelson moved to <a href="Nashville,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Nashville</a> in 1960, but no label signed him. Although most of his demos were rejected, thanks to his songwriting and <a href="Hank_Cochran" title="wikilink">Hank Cochran</a>'s help, he signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music. After Ray Price recorded Nelson's &quot;Night Life&quot;, Nelson joined Price's touring band as a bass player. While playing with Price and the <em><a href="Cherokee_Cowboys" title="wikilink">Cherokee Cowboys</a></em>, Nelson's songs became hits for other artists, including &quot;<a href="Funny_How_Time_Slips_Away" title="wikilink">Funny How Time Slips Away</a>&quot; (<a href="Billy_Walker_(singer)" title="wikilink">Billy Walker</a>), &quot;<a href="Hello_Walls" title="wikilink">Hello Walls</a>&quot; (<a href="Faron_Young" title="wikilink">Faron Young</a>), &quot;Pretty Paper&quot; (<a href="Roy_Orbison" title="wikilink">Roy Orbison</a>), and, most famously, &quot;<a href="Crazy_(Willie_Nelson_song)" title="wikilink">Crazy</a>&quot; (<a href="Patsy_Cline" title="wikilink">Patsy Cline</a>), which became the biggest <a href="jukebox" class="uri" title="wikilink">jukebox</a> hit of all time.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> </p>
<p>Nelson signed with <a href="Liberty_Records" title="wikilink">Liberty Records</a> and was recording by August 1961 at <a href="Quonset_Hut_Studio" title="wikilink">Quonset Hut Studio</a>. His first two successful singles as an artist were released by the next year, including &quot;Willingly&quot; (which became his first charting single and first Top Ten at #10) and &quot;Touch Me&quot; (his second Top Ten, stalling at #7), a duet with his soon-to-be second wife, <a href="Shirley_Collie_Nelson" title="wikilink">Shirley Collie</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Unfortunately, further hit singles eluded him. Nelson's tenure at Liberty yielded his first album entitled <em><a href="And_Then_I_Wrote" title="wikilink">And Then I Wrote</a></em>, released in September 1962.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> <a href="Fred_Foster" title="wikilink">Fred Foster</a> of <a href="Monument_Records" title="wikilink">Monument Records</a> signed Nelson in early 1964, but only one single was released, &quot;I Never Cared For You&quot;.</p>
<p>By the fall of 1964, Nelson had moved to RCA Victor Records at the behest of <a href="Chet_Atkins" title="wikilink">Chet Atkins</a>, signing a contract for US $10,000 per year. <em><a href="Country_Willie_&lt;U+2013&gt;_His_Own_Songs" title="wikilink">Country Willie &lt;U+2013&gt; His Own Songs</a></em> became Nelson's first RCA album, recorded in April 1965. That same year he joined the <a href="Grand_Ole_Opry" title="wikilink">Grand Ole Opry</a>. During his first few years on RCA, Nelson had no significant hits, but from November 1966 through March 1969, his singles reached the Top 25 in a consistent manner. &quot;One In a Row&quot; (#19, 1966), &quot;The Party's Over&quot; (#24 during a 16-week chart run in 1967), and his cover of <a href="Morecambe_&amp;_Wise" title="wikilink">Morecambe &amp; Wise</a>'s &quot;Bring Me Sunshine&quot; (#13, March 1969) were Nelson's best-selling records during his time with RCA. After recording his final RCA single &lt;U+2013&gt; &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; (backed with &quot;Phases, Stages, Circles, Cycles and Scenes&quot;) in late April 1972, RCA requested that Nelson renew his contract ahead of schedule, with the implication that RCA would not release his latest recordings if he did not. He signed Neil Rashen as his manager to negotiate with the label, who got RCA to agree to end Nelson's contract upon repayment of US$14,000. During those proceedings, Nelson decided to move to <a href="Austin,_Texas" title="wikilink">Austin, Texas</a> and take a short break. Austin's burgeoning hippie music scene (see <a href="Armadillo_World_Headquarters" title="wikilink">Armadillo World Headquarters</a>) rejuvenated the singer. His popularity in Austin soared as he played his own brand of country music marked by country, folk and jazz influences. Rashen eventually signed Nelson to <a href="Atlantic_Records" title="wikilink">Atlantic Records</a> for US$25,000 per year, becoming the label's first country artist. By February 1973, Nelson was recording his acclaimed <em><a href="Shotgun_Willie" title="wikilink">Shotgun Willie</a></em> at Atlantic Studios in New York City.</p>

<p><em><a href="Shotgun_Willie" title="wikilink">Shotgun Willie</a></em>, released in May 1973, earned excellent reviews but did not sell well. The album led Nelson to a new style, later stating that <em><a href="Shotgun_Willie" title="wikilink">Shotgun Willie</a></em> had &quot;cleared his throat&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> His next album, <em>Phases and Stages</em>, released in 1974, was a concept album about a couple's divorce, inspired by his own experience. Side one of the record is from the viewpoint of the man, while the other side is from the viewpoint of the woman.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The album included the hit single &quot;Bloody Mary Morning.&quot; Nelson then moved to <a href="Columbia_Records" title="wikilink">Columbia Records</a>, where he signed a contract that gave him complete creative control, made possible by the critical and commercial success of his previous albums. The result was the critically acclaimed, and massively popular 1975 concept album <em>Red Headed Stranger</em>. Although Columbia was reluctant to release an album with primarily a guitar and piano for accompaniment, Nelson and Waylon Jennings insisted. The album included a cover of <a href="Fred_Rose_(musician)" title="wikilink">Fred Rose</a>'s 1945 song &quot;<a href="Blue_Eyes_Crying_in_the_Rain" title="wikilink">Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain</a>&quot;, that had been released as a single previous to the album, and became Nelson's first number one hit as a singer.</p>

<p>As Jennings was also achieving success in country music in the early 1970s, the pair were combined into a genre called <a href="outlaw_country" title="wikilink">outlaw country</a>, since it did not conform to Nashville standards. The album <em><a href="Wanted!_The_Outlaws" title="wikilink">Wanted! The Outlaws</a></em> in 1976 with <a href="Jessi_Colter" title="wikilink">Jessi Colter</a> and <a href="Tompall_Glaser" title="wikilink">Tompall Glaser</a> cemented the pair's outlaw image and became country music's first platinum album. Later that year Nelson released <em><a href="The_Sound_in_Your_Mind" title="wikilink">The Sound in Your Mind</a></em> (certified gold in 1978 and platinum in 2001)<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and his first gospel album <em><a href="The_Troublemaker_(album)" title="wikilink">Troublemaker</a></em><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> (certified gold in 1986).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> In 1978, Nelson released two more platinum albums, <em><a href="Waylon_&amp;_Willie" title="wikilink">Waylon &amp; Willie</a></em>, a collaboration with Jennings that included &quot;<a href="Mammas_Don&#39;t_Let_Your_Babies_Grow_Up_to_Be_Cowboys" title="wikilink">Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys</a>&quot;, a hit single written and performed by <a href="Ed_Bruce" title="wikilink">Ed Bruce</a>. Though observers predicted that <em>Stardust</em> would ruin his career, it went platinum the same year.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Nelson continued to top the charts with hit songs during the late 1970s, including &quot;<a href="Good_Hearted_Woman_(song)" title="wikilink">Good Hearted Woman</a>&quot;, &quot;Remember Me&quot;, &quot;<a href="If_You&#39;ve_Got_the_Money_I&#39;ve_Got_the_Time" title="wikilink">If You've Got the Money I've Got the Time</a>&quot;, and &quot;Uncloudy Day&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>During the 1980s Nelson recorded a series of hit singles including &quot;<a href="Midnight_Rider" title="wikilink">Midnight Rider</a>&quot;, a 1980 cover of the <a href="Allman_Brothers" title="wikilink">Allman Brothers</a> song which Nelson recorded for <em><a href="The_Electric_Horseman" title="wikilink">The Electric Horseman</a></em>,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> the soundtrack &quot;<a href="On_the_Road_Again_(Willie_Nelson_song)" title="wikilink">On the Road Again</a>&quot; from the movie <em><a href="Honeysuckle_Rose_(film)" title="wikilink">Honeysuckle Rose</a></em>,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and a duet with <a href="Julio_Iglesias" title="wikilink">Julio Iglesias</a> titled &quot;<a href="To_All_the_Girls_I&#39;ve_Loved_Before" title="wikilink">To All the Girls I've Loved Before</a>&quot;. <em><a href="Pancho_&amp;_Lefty_(album)" title="wikilink">Pancho &amp; Lefty</a></em>, a duet album with <a href="Merle_Haggard" title="wikilink">Merle Haggard</a>,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and <em><a href="WWII_(album)" title="wikilink">WWII</a></em>, with Jennings, came out in 1982,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> while <em><a href="Take_It_to_the_Limit_(Willie_Nelson_album)" title="wikilink">Take it to the Limit</a></em> was released in 1983, also with Jennings.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, Nelson, Jennings, Kristofferson, and <a href="Johnny_Cash" title="wikilink">Johnny Cash</a> formed <a href="The_Highwaymen_(country_supergroup)" title="wikilink">The Highwaymen</a>,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> who achieved platinum record sales and toured the world.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Meanwhile, he became more involved with charity work, such as singing on <em><a href="We_are_the_World" title="wikilink">We are the World</a></em> in 1984. In 1985, Nelson had another success with <em><a href="Half_Nelson_(Willie_Nelson_album)" title="wikilink">Half Nelson</a></em>, a compilation album of duets with a range of artists such as <a href="Ray_Charles" title="wikilink">Ray Charles</a> and <a href="Neil_Young" title="wikilink">Neil Young</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In 1980, Nelson performed on the south lawn of the <a href="White_House" title="wikilink">White House</a>.

<p>In 1990, the <a href="Internal_Revenue_Service" title="wikilink">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) seized most of Nelson's assets, claiming that he owed US$32,000,000. It was later discovered that his accountants, <a href="Price_Waterhouse" title="wikilink">Price Waterhouse</a>, had not been paying Nelson's taxes for years. In addition to the unpaid taxes, Nelson's situation was worsened by the weak investments he had made during the early 1980s.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> His lawyer, <a href="Jay_Goldberg" title="wikilink">Jay Goldberg</a> negotiated the sum to be lowered to US$16,000,000. Later, Nelson's attorney renegotiated a settlement with the IRS in which he paid US$6,000,000, although Nelson did not comply with the agreement. Nelson released <em><a href="The_IRS_Tapes:_Who&#39;ll_Buy_My_Memories?" title="wikilink">The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?</a></em> as a double album, with all profits destined for the IRS. Many of his assets were auctioned and purchased by friends, who donated or rented his possessions to him for a nominal fee.
