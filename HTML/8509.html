<p>The FSB is involved in <a href="counter-intelligence" class="uri" title="wikilink">counter-intelligence</a>, <a href="internal_security" title="wikilink">internal</a> and <a href="border_control" title="wikilink">border security</a>, <a href="counter-terrorism" class="uri" title="wikilink">counter-terrorism</a>, and <a href="surveillance" class="uri" title="wikilink">surveillance</a>. Its headquarters are on <a href="Lubyanka_Square" title="wikilink">Lubyanka Square</a>, downtown <a href="Moscow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moscow</a>, the same location as <a href="Lubyanka_(KGB)" title="wikilink">the former headquarters of the KGB</a>.</p>
<p>The service was formerly known as the <a href="FSK_(Russia)" title="wikilink">Federal Counterintelligence Service</a> (FSK). A bill calling for the reorganization, expansion and renaming of FSK passed both <a href="Federal_Assembly_of_Russia" title="wikilink">houses of the Russian parliament</a> and was signed into law on April 3, 1995 by <a href="Boris_Yeltsin" title="wikilink">Boris Yeltsin</a>. It was made subordinate to the <a href="Ministry_of_Justice" title="wikilink">Ministry of Justice</a> by presidential decree on March 9, 2004.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><img src="KGB_House_Main.jpg" title="fig:Lubyanka, headquarters of the FSB" alt="Lubyanka, headquarters of the FSB" width="400" /> The FSB is engaged mostly in domestic affairs, while espionage duties were taken over by the Russian <a href="Foreign_Intelligence_Service_(Russia)" title="wikilink">Foreign Intelligence Service</a> (former <a href="First_Chief_Directorate" title="wikilink">First Chief Directorate</a> of the <a href="KGB" class="uri" title="wikilink">KGB</a>). However, the FSB also includes the <a href="FAPSI" class="uri" title="wikilink">FAPSI</a> agency, which conducts electronic surveillance abroad. In addition, the FSB operates freely within the territories of the former <a href="Soviet_republics" title="wikilink">Soviet republics</a>, and it can conduct anti-terrorist military operations anywhere in the World if ordered by the President, according to the recently adopted terrorism law. All law enforcement and intelligence agencies in Russia work under the guidance of FSB if needed. For example, the <a href="GRU" class="uri" title="wikilink">GRU</a>, <a href="spetsnaz" class="uri" title="wikilink">spetsnaz</a> and <a href="Internal_Troops" title="wikilink">Internal Troops</a> detachments of <a href="Russian_Ministry_of_Internal_Affairs" title="wikilink">Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs</a> work together with the FSB in <a href="Chechnya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chechnya</a>.</p>
<p>The FSB is responsible for internal security of the Russian state, <a href="counterespionage" class="uri" title="wikilink">counterespionage</a>, and the fight against <a href="organized_crime" title="wikilink">organized crime</a>, <a href="terrorism" class="uri" title="wikilink">terrorism</a>, and <a href="Illegal_drug_trade" title="wikilink">drug smuggling</a>. However, critics claim that it is engaged in suppression of internal dissent, bringing the entire population of Russia under total control, and influencing important political events, just as the <a href="KGB" class="uri" title="wikilink">KGB</a> did in the past. To achieve these goals, it is said the FSB implements <a href="mass_surveillance" title="wikilink">mass surveillance</a> and a variety of <a href="active_measures" title="wikilink">active measures</a>, including <a href="disinformation" class="uri" title="wikilink">disinformation</a>, <a href="propaganda" class="uri" title="wikilink">propaganda</a> through the state-controlled <a href="mass_media" title="wikilink">mass media</a>, <a href="Agent_provocateur" title="wikilink">provocations</a>, and <a href="persecution" class="uri" title="wikilink">persecution</a> of opposition politicians, <a href="investigative_journalist" title="wikilink">investigative journalists</a>, and <a href="dissident" title="wikilink">dissidents</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The FSB is a very large organization that combines functions and powers similar to those exercised by the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> <a href="Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="wikilink">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI), the <a href="United_States_Federal_Protective_Service" title="wikilink">Federal Protective Service</a>, the <a href="United_States_Secret_Service" title="wikilink">Secret Service</a>, the <a href="National_Security_Agency" title="wikilink">National Security Agency</a> (NSA), <a href="U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection" title="wikilink">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a>, <a href="United_States_Coast_Guard" title="wikilink">United States Coast Guard</a>, and <a href="Drug_Enforcement_Administration" title="wikilink">Drug Enforcement Administration</a>. FSB also commands a contingent of <a href="Internal_Troops" title="wikilink">Internal Troops</a>, <a href="spetsnaz" class="uri" title="wikilink">spetsnaz</a>, and an extensive network of civilian informants.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The number of FSB personnel and its budget remain state secrets, although the budget was reported to jump nearly 40% in 2006.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The number of Chekists in Russia in 1992 was estimated as approximately 500,000.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Some observers note that FSB is more powerful than KGB was, because it does not operate under the control of the <a href="Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Communist Party</a> as KGB did in the past.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> According to <a href="Ion_Mihai_Pacepa" title="wikilink">Ion Mihai Pacepa</a>, &quot;In the Soviet Union, the KGB was a state within a state. Now former KGB officers are running the state. They have custody of the country&lt;U+2019&gt;s 6,000 nuclear weapons, entrusted to the KGB in the 1950s, and they now also manage the strategic oil industry renationalized by Putin. The KGB successor, rechristened FSB, still has the right to electronically monitor the population, control political groups, search homes and businesses, infiltrate the federal government, create its own front enterprises, investigate cases, and run its own prison system. The Soviet Union had one KGB officer for every 428 citizens. Putin&lt;U+2019&gt;s Russia has one FSB-ist for every 297 citizens.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Peter Finn of the <a href="Washington_Post" title="wikilink">Washington Post</a> argues that the FSB is now the leading political force in Russia, which simply replaced the <a href="Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Communist Party</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <a href="Alexander_Litvinenko" title="wikilink">Alexander Litvinenko</a> and <a href="Yuri_Felshtinsky" title="wikilink">Yuri Felshtinsky</a> claim in their book, <em><a href="Blowing_up_Russia:_Terror_from_within" title="wikilink">Blowing up Russia: Terror from within</a></em>, that the FSB became an international criminal organization that actually promotes and perpetrates the <a href="terrorism" class="uri" title="wikilink">terrorism</a> and <a href="organized_crime" title="wikilink">organized crime</a> in order to achieve its political and financial goals, instead of fighting the terrorism and crime.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Yuri Felshtinsky, Alexander Litvinenko, and Geoffrey Andrews. <em>Blowing up Russia : Terror from within.</em> New York 2002.

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="initial-reorganization-of-the-kgb">Initial reorganization of the KGB</h3>

<p>During the late 1980s, as the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet</a> <a href="Politics_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">government</a> and <a href="Economy_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">economy</a> were disintegrating, the KGB survived better than most state institutions, suffering far fewer cuts in its personnel and budget. Following the <a href="Soviet_coup_attempt_of_1991" title="wikilink">attempted coup of 1991</a> (in which some KGB units participated)<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> against Soviet leader <a href="Mikhail_Gorbachev" title="wikilink">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, the <a href="KGB" class="uri" title="wikilink">KGB</a> was dismantled and formally ceased to exist from November 1991.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>In late 1991 the domestic security functions of the KGB were reconstituted as the <a href="FSK_(Russia)" title="wikilink">Federal Counterintelligence Service</a> (FSK), which was placed under the control of the president. The FSK had been known initially for some time as the Ministry of Security. In 1995, the FSK was renamed and reorganized into the FSB by the Federal Law of April 3, 1995, &quot;On the Organs of the Federal Security Service in the Russian Federation&quot;, granting it additional powers, enabling it to enter private homes and to conduct intelligence activities in Russia as well as abroad in cooperation with the Russian <a href="Foreign_Intelligence_Service" title="wikilink">Foreign Intelligence Service</a> (SVR).<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The FSB reforms were rounded out by <a href="decree" class="uri" title="wikilink">decree</a> No. 633, signed by <a href="Boris_Yeltsin" title="wikilink">Boris Yeltsin</a> on June 23, 1995. The <a href="decree" class="uri" title="wikilink">decree</a> made the tasks of the FSB more specific, giving the FSB substantial rights to conduct cryptographic work, and described the powers of the FSB director. The number of deputy directors was increased to 8: 2 first deputies, 5 deputies responsible for departments and directorates and 1 deputy director heading the <a href="Moscow" title="wikilink">Moscow City</a> and <a href="Moscow_Oblast" title="wikilink">Moscow regional</a> directorate. Yeltsin appointed Colonel-General <a href="Mikhail_Barsukov" title="wikilink">Mikhail Ivanovich Barsukov</a> as the new director of the FSB.</p>
<p>In 1998 Yeltsin appointed as director of the FSB <a href="Vladimir_Putin" title="wikilink">Vladimir Putin</a>, a KGB veteran who would later succeed Yeltsin as federal president.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Yeltsin also ordered the FSB to expand its operations against <a href="labor_union" title="wikilink">labor unions</a> in <a href="Siberia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Siberia</a> and to crack down on <a href="right-wing" class="uri" title="wikilink">right-wing</a> <a href="dissident" title="wikilink">dissidents</a>. As president, Putin increased the FSB's powers to include <a href="Counter-intelligence" title="wikilink">countering foreign intelligence operations</a>, fighting <a href="organized_crime" title="wikilink">organized crime</a>, and suppressing <a href="Chechnya" title="wikilink">Chechen</a> separatists.</p>
<h3 id="post-2000">Post-2000</h3>
<p>On June 17, 2000, President <a href="Vladimir_Putin" title="wikilink">Vladimir Putin</a> signed a decree, according to which the FSB was supposed to have a director, a first deputy director and eight other deputy directors, including one stats-secretary and the chiefs of six departments (Economic Security Department, Counterintelligence Department, Organizational and Personnel Service, Department of activity provision, Department for Analysis, Forecasting and Strategic Planning, Department for Protection of the Constitutional System and the Fight against Terrorism). On June 11, 2001, the President introduced one more deputy director position.</p>
<p>According to a decree signed by Putin on March 11, 2003, by July 1 <a href="Border_Guard_Service_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Border Guard Service of Russia</a> had been transferred to FSB while <a href="FAPSI" class="uri" title="wikilink">FAPSI</a>, agency of government telecommunications, had been abolished, granting FSB with a major part of its functions.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2003 Putin allowed the FSB to have three first deputy directors, including the Chief of the Border Guard Service (<a href="Vladimir_Pronichev" title="wikilink">Vladimir Pronichev</a>), and specified that a deputy director position must be assumed by the Chief of the Inspection Directorate. On July 11, 2004, the President reorganized FSB again.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> It was prescribed to have a director, two first deputy directors (<a href="Sergei_Smirnov" title="wikilink">Sergei Smirnov</a> and <a href="Vladimir_Pronichev" title="wikilink">Vladimir Pronichev</a>, one of whom should be the Chief of the Border Guard Service (Pronichev).</p>
<p>On December 2, 2005, Putin authorized FSB to have one more deputy director. This position was assumed by <a href="Vladimir_Bulavin" title="wikilink">Vladimir Bulavin</a> on March 3, 2006.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 2006 the Italian news agency <a href="ANSA" class="uri" title="wikilink">ANSA</a> reported the publication on the FSB website of an offer, open to Russian citizens working as spies for a foreign country, to work as <a href="double_agents" title="wikilink">double agents</a>.</p>
<p>In September 2006, the FSB was shaken by a major reshuffle, which, combined with some earlier reassignments (most remarkably, those of FSB Deputy Directors <a href="Yury_Zaostrovtsev" title="wikilink">Yury Zaostrovtsev</a> and <a href="Vladimir_Anisimov" title="wikilink">Vladimir Anisimov</a> in 2004 and 2005, respectively), were widely believed to be linked to the <a href="Three_Whales_Corruption_Scandal" title="wikilink">Three Whales Corruption Scandal</a> that had slowly unfolded since 2000. Some analysts considered it to be an attempt to undermine FSB Director <a href="Nikolay_Patrushev" title="wikilink">Nikolay Patrushev</a>'s influence, as it was Patrushev's team from the <a href="Karelia" title="wikilink">Karelian</a> KGB Directorate of the late 1980s &lt;U+2013&gt; early 1990s that had suffered most and he had been on vacations during the event.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>Then-FSB Director <a href="Nikolay_Kovalev_(FSB)" title="wikilink">Nikolay Kovalev</a> said in 1996: &quot;There has never been such a number of <a href="spy" title="wikilink">spies</a> arrested by us since the time when German agents were sent in during the years of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>.&quot; The FSB reported that around 400 foreign intelligence agents were uncovered in 1995 and 1996.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In 2006 the FSB reported about 27 foreign intelligence officers and 89 foreign agents whose activities were stopped.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>An increasing number of scientists have been accused of espionage and illegal technology exports by FSB during the last decade: researcher <a href="Igor_Sutyagin" title="wikilink">Igor Sutyagin</a>,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> physicist <a href="Valentin_Danilov" title="wikilink">Valentin Danilov</a>,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> physical chemist Oleg Korobeinichev,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> academician Oskar Kaibyshev,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> and physicist Yury Ryzhov.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Some other widely covered cases of political prosecution include investigator <a href="Mikhail_Trepashkin" title="wikilink">Mikhail Trepashkin</a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and journalist Vladimir Rakhmankov.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> All these people are either under arrest or serve long jail sentences.</p>

<p>According to former Russian <a href="State_Duma" title="wikilink">Duma</a> member Konstantin Borovoi, &quot;Putin's appointment is the culmination of the KGB's crusade for power. This is its finale. Now the KGB runs the country.&quot;<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Olga Kryshtanovskaya, director of the Moscow-based Center for the Study of Elites, has found that up to 78% of 1,016 leading political figures in Russia have served previously in organizations affiliated with KGB or FSB.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> She said: &quot;If in the Soviet period and the first post-Soviet period, the KGB and FSB people were mainly involved in security issues, now half are still involved in security but the other half are involved in <a href="business" class="uri" title="wikilink">business</a>, <a href="political_parties" title="wikilink">political parties</a>, <a href="NGO" title="wikilink">NGOs</a>, regional governments, even culture...

<p>This situation is very similar to that of the former <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> where all key positions in the government were occupied by members of the Communist Party. The KGB or FSB members usually remain in the &quot;acting reserve&quot; even if they formally leave the organization (&quot;acting reserve&quot; members receive second FSB salary, follow FSB instructions, and remain &quot;above the law&quot; being protected by the organization, according to Kryshtanovskaya).<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> As <a href="Vladimir_Putin" title="wikilink">Vladimir Putin</a> said, <em>&quot;There is no such thing as a former KGB man&quot;</em>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> <a href="GRU" class="uri" title="wikilink">GRU</a> defector and writer <a href="Victor_Suvorov" title="wikilink">Victor Suvorov</a> explained that members of Russian security services can leave such organizations only in a coffin, because they know too much.

<p>The idea of the <a href="KGB" class="uri" title="wikilink">KGB</a> acting as a leading political force rather than a security organization has been discussed by historian <a href="Abdurakhman_Avtorkhanov" title="wikilink">Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov</a>,<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> journalist <a href="John_Barron_(journalist)" title="wikilink">John Barron</a>, writer and former <a href="GRU" class="uri" title="wikilink">GRU</a> officer <a href="Victor_Suvorov" title="wikilink">Victor Suvorov</a>, retired KGB Major General <a href="Oleg_Kalugin" title="wikilink">Oleg Kalugin</a>,<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> and <a href="Evgenia_Albats" title="wikilink">Evgenia Albats</a>.
