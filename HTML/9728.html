<p><strong>Joanna Clare &quot;Jo&quot; Yeates</strong> (19 April 1985 &lt;U+2013&gt; 17 December 2010) was a 25-year old <a href="landscape_architect" title="wikilink">landscape architect</a> from <a href="Hampshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hampshire</a>, England, who went <a href="missing_person" title="wikilink">missing</a> on 17 December 2010 in <a href="Bristol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bristol</a> after an evening out with colleagues. Following a highly publicised appeal for information on her whereabouts and intensive police enquiries, her body was discovered on 25 December 2010 in <a href="Failand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Failand</a>, <a href="North_Somerset" title="wikilink">North Somerset</a>. After a <a href="Autopsy" title="wikilink">post-mortem examination</a> it was determined that she had been <a href="strangling" title="wikilink">strangled</a>.</p>
<p>The murder inquiry, named Operation Braid, was one of the largest ever police investigations in the Bristol area. The case dominated news coverage in the United Kingdom around the Christmas period as Yeates' family sought assistance from the public through <a href="social_networking_service" title="wikilink">social networking services</a> and press conferences. Rewards amounting to &lt;U+00A3&gt;60,000 were offered for information leading to those responsible for Yeates' death. The police initially suspected and arrested Christopher Jefferies, Yeates' landlord, who lived in a flat in the same building as she.</p>
<p>Vincent Tabak, a 32-year-old <a href="Dutch_people" title="wikilink">Dutch</a> engineer and neighbour of Yeates, was arrested on 20 January 2011. Media attention at the time centred on the filming of a re-enactment of her disappearance for the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a>'s programme, <em><a href="Crimewatch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crimewatch</a></em>. After two days of questioning, he was charged on 22 January 2011 with Yeates' murder. On 5 May 2011, Tabak pleaded guilty to Yeates' <a href="manslaughter" class="uri" title="wikilink">manslaughter</a>, but denied murdering her. His trial started on 4 October 2011; he was found guilty of murder on 28 October 2011, and sentenced to <a href="Life_imprisonment_in_England_and_Wales" title="wikilink">life imprisonment</a> with a recommendation he serve at least 20 years.</p>
<p>The nature of press reporting on aspects of the case led to the instigation of legal proceedings against a number of UK newspapers. <a href="Defamation" title="wikilink">Libel</a> action was brought by Jefferies against eight publications over their coverage of his arrest, resulting in the payment to him of substantial damages. The <em><a href="Daily_Mirror" title="wikilink">Daily Mirror</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">The Sun</a></em> were found guilty of <a href="Contempt_of_court#England" title="wikilink">contempt of court</a> for reporting information that could prejudice a trial. A memorial service was held for Yeates at the parish church in the Bristol suburb where she lived; her funeral took place near the family home in Hampshire. Several memorials were planned, including one in a garden she had been designing for a new hospital in Bristol.</p>
<h2 id="background-and-disappearance">Background and disappearance</h2>
<p>Joanna Clare Yeates was born on 19 April 1985 to David and Teresa Yeates in <a href="Hampshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hampshire</a>, England.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> She was <a href="Private_school#United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">privately educated</a> at <a href="Embley_Park" title="wikilink">Embley Park</a> near <a href="Romsey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romsey</a>. Yeates studied for her <a href="GCE_Advanced_Level" title="wikilink">A-levels</a> at <a href="Peter_Symonds_College" title="wikilink">Peter Symonds College</a> and graduated with a degree in <a href="landscape_architecture" title="wikilink">landscape architecture</a> from <a href="Writtle_College" title="wikilink">Writtle College</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> She received her Master's degree in landscape architecture from the <a href="University_of_Gloucestershire" title="wikilink">University of Gloucestershire</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In December 2008, Yeates met then-25-year-old fellow landscape architect Greg Reardon<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> at the firm Hyland Edgar Driver in <a href="Winchester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Winchester</a>. The couple moved in together in 2009 and settled in <a href="Clifton,_Bristol" title="wikilink">Clifton, Bristol</a>, when the company relocated to that area.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Yeates later changed jobs to work at the <a href="Building_Design_Partnership" title="wikilink">Building Design Partnership</a> in Bristol.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

An overhead sign reads Bristol Ram. A red car is parked in front on a road sloping down to the right" /> At approximately 8:00 pm on 19 December 2010, Reardon returned home from a weekend visit to <a href="Sheffield" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sheffield</a> to find Yeates absent from their flat on Canynge Road, Clifton. Reardon had been trying to contact her by <a href="Telephone" title="wikilink">phone</a> and <a href="SMS" title="wikilink">text</a>, but did not find it &quot;completely out of character&quot; that she did not respond. While awaiting Yeates' return, Reardon found that her purse and keys were at the flat, and that their cat appeared to have been neglected.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> After he called her again, her mobile phone rang from a pocket of her coat at the flat.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Around midnight, Reardon contacted the police and then Yeates' parents to report her missing.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Investigators subsequently pieced together the sequence of events leading up to her disappearance. They determined Yeates had spent the evening of 17 December 2010 with colleagues at the Bristol Ram pub on <a href="Park_Street,_Bristol" title="wikilink">Park Street</a>, leaving at around 8:00 pm to begin the 20-minute walk home.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> She told friends and colleagues that she was looking forward to spending the weekend alone; she planned to spend her time baking and shopping for Christmas.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Yeates was seen on <a href="closed-circuit_television" title="wikilink">closed-circuit television</a> (CCTV) at around 8:10 pm leaving a <a href="Waitrose" class="uri" title="wikilink">Waitrose</a> supermarket without purchasing anything.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> She phoned her best friend, Rebecca Scott, at 8:30 pm to arrange a meeting on Christmas Eve.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The last known footage of Yeates recorded her buying a pizza from a branch of <a href="Tesco_Express" title="wikilink">Tesco Express</a> at around 8:40 pm.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> She had also bought two small bottles of cider at a nearby shop, Bargain Booze.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="search-public-appeal-and-discovery-of-body">Search, public appeal, and discovery of body</h2>
<p>Reardon and Yeates' friends set up a website and used social networking services to help look for her.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> On 21 December 2010, Yeates' parents and Reardon made a public appeal for her safe return at a police press conference.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In another press conference, broadcast live on 23 December 2010 by <a href="Sky_News" title="wikilink">Sky News</a> and <a href="BBC_News" title="wikilink">BBC News</a>, Yeates' father David commented on her disappearance: &quot;I think she was abducted after getting home to her flat ... I have no idea of the circumstances of the abduction because of what was left behind ... I feel sure she would not have gone out by herself leaving all these things behind and she was taken away somewhere&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Her keys, phone, purse and coat were left behind at her flat.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Detectives retrieved a <a href="receipt" class="uri" title="wikilink">receipt</a> for a pizza, but found no sign of it or of its <a href="packaging" class="uri" title="wikilink">packaging</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Both bottles of cider were found in the flat, one of them partially consumed.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> As there was no <a href="evidence" class="uri" title="wikilink">evidence</a> of <a href="forced_entry" title="wikilink">forced entry</a> or a struggle,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> investigators began to examine the possibility that Yeates may have known her abductor.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>On 25 December 2010, a fully clothed body was found in the snow by a couple walking their dogs along Longwood Lane near a <a href="golf_course" title="wikilink">golf course</a> and next to the entrance of a <a href="quarry" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarry</a> in <a href="Failand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Failand</a>, approximately  from her home.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The body was identified by police as that of Yeates.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Reardon and the Yeates family visited the site of the discovery on 27 December 2010.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> David Yeates said that the family &quot;had been told to prepare for the worst&quot; and expressed relief that his daughter's body had been recovered.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Funeral arrangements were delayed as investigators wished to retain the body for a while.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The <a href="pathologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">pathologist</a> Dr Nat Carey consented to the release of the body on 31 January 2011.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="investigation">Investigation</h2>
<p>The investigation, called &quot;Operation Braid&quot;, comprised 80 <a href="detective" title="wikilink">detectives</a> and civilian staff under the direction of Detective <a href="Chief_Inspector" title="wikilink">Chief Inspector</a> Phil Jones, a senior officer with <a href="Avon_and_Somerset_Constabulary" title="wikilink">Avon and Somerset Constabulary's</a> major crime investigation unit.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> It became one of the largest police operations in the Constabulary's history.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Jones urged the public to come forward with any information to help catch the killer, especially potential witnesses who were in the vicinity of Longwood Lane in Failand in the period before Yeates' body was discovered there.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> He stated that the investigation was seeking the driver of a &quot;light-coloured <a href="Sport_utility_vehicle" title="wikilink">4x4 vehicle</a>&quot; for questioning.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Jones said that officers had been &quot;inundated with thousands of calls&quot; and were &quot;exhausting every lead and avenue that [they were] provided with.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Police examined over 100 hours of surveillance footage along with  of rubbish seized from the area around Yeates' flat.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Refuse collection had been suspended in that part of Clifton since 23 December 2010.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> <a href="Crime_Stoppers" title="wikilink">Crime Stoppers</a> offered a <a href="pound_sterling" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00A3&gt;</a>10,000 <a href="bounty_(reward)" title="wikilink">reward</a> for information leading to the arrest and conviction of her murderer,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> while <em><a href="The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">The Sun</a></em> newspaper offered &lt;U+00A3&gt;50,000.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Authorities advised people living in the area to secure their homes, and warned women not to walk alone after dark.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Speaking on 29 December about the murder investigation Yeates' father said, &quot;I fear that whoever has done this will never hand themselves in, but we live in hope that the police will catch who is responsible.&quot;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="post-mortem-and-initial-enquiries">Post-mortem and initial enquiries</h3>

<p>Following the discovery of Yeates' body detectives from the Avon and Somerset Constabulary issued an appeal for anyone with information about the death to come forward,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> and investigated similarities with other unsolved cases. Of particular interest to them were those of 20-year-old <a href="List_of_unsolved_murders_in_the_United_Kingdom#1970s" title="wikilink">Glenis Carruthers</a> who was strangled in 1974, <a href="murder_of_Melanie_Hall" title="wikilink">Melanie Hall</a>, aged 25, who disappeared in 1996 and whose body was discovered thirteen years later, and 35-year-old <a href="disappearance_of_Claudia_Lawrence" title="wikilink">Claudia Lawrence</a> who went missing in 2009.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Investigators identified &quot;striking similarities&quot; between the Yeates and Hall cases, notably their age and appearance, and that they had disappeared after returning home from meeting friends,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> but the possibility of such connections was later downplayed by authorities.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The police gathered surveillance video from <a href="Clifton_Suspension_Bridge" title="wikilink">Clifton Suspension Bridge</a>, which forms part of the most direct route from the crime scene to the Clifton suburb where Yeates was last seen alive.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The footage was of poor quality, making it impossible to clearly distinguish individuals or car registration numbers.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Investigators were aware that the perpetrator could have used an alternative bridge across the <a href="River_Avon_(Bristol)" title="wikilink">River Avon</a> less than a mile to the south to avoid CCTV coverage.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>A <a href="Autopsy" title="wikilink">post-mortem examination</a> began on 26 December 2010, though results were delayed due to the frozen condition of the body.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Police initially thought it possible that Yeates froze to death because her body showed no visible signs of injury.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Investigators announced on 28 December 2010 that the case had become a murder inquiry as the coroner determined that Yeates had died as a result of strangulation.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The post-mortem indicated that she had died &quot;several days before being discovered&quot; on 25 December 2010.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The examination also confirmed that Yeates did not eat the pizza she had purchased.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Detective Chief Inspector Jones stated that the investigation found &quot;no evidence to suggest that Joanna was sexually assaulted&quot;.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The police searched Reardon's laptop computer and mobile phone as part of standard procedure.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Reardon was ruled out as a suspect and treated as a witness.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>A young woman attending a party at a neighbouring house on Canynge Road on the night of Yeates' disappearance recalled hearing two loud screams shortly after 9:00 pm coming from the direction of Yeates' flat.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Another neighbour who lived behind Yeates' home said that he heard a high-pitched woman's voice scream &quot;Help me&quot;.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Officers removed the front door to Yeates' flat to check for clothing fibres and DNA evidence,<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> with investigators examining the possibility that the perpetrator had entered the flat before Yeates returned home.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="further-enquiries">Further enquiries</h3>
<p>Senior officers from the investigation asked for assistance from the <a href="National_Policing_Improvement_Agency" title="wikilink">National Policing Improvement Agency</a>, which provides expertise for difficult cases. On 4 January 2011, a clinical <a href="forensic_psychology" title="wikilink">forensic psychologist</a>, who had previously been involved as a <a href="offender_profiling" title="wikilink">criminal profiler</a> in other high profile murder cases, joined the investigation to help narrow down the number of potential suspects.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Jones stated that his officers were checking through 1,300 tips and pieces of information from the public and had established over 1,000 lines of inquiry, 239 of them considered &quot;high priority&quot;.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Jones said, &quot;I can assure you, we are determined to solve this crime and bring Jo's killers to justice.

<p>On 9 January 2011, Bristol East MP <a href="Kerry_McCarthy" title="wikilink">Kerry McCarthy</a> gave her support to the idea of a public DNA screening process if the police found it useful. The Avon and Somerset Constabulary had conducted mass DNA screening during the 1995 investigation into the disappearance of then-18-year-old Louise Smith.

Lindsey Lennen, a body fluids and DNA specialist member of the team that analysed DNA samples from Yeates' body said that although DNA swabs matched Tabak, they were not of sufficient quality to be evaluated. The team deployed a method known as DNA SenCE, which enhances unusable DNA samples through purification and concentration: &quot;We couldn't say whether the DNA was from saliva, or semen, or even touch. But we could say that the probability of it not being a match with Tabak was less than one in a billion.&quot;<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>

<p>Tabak initially maintained he was not responsible for Joanna Yeates' death, claiming that DNA evidence linking him to the crime had been fabricated by corrupt officials.

<p>Vincent Tabak (born 10 February 1978) was a Dutch engineer<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> who had lived and worked in the United Kingdom since 2007.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> The son of Gerald and Sonja Tabak,<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> and the youngest of five siblings,<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> he was raised in <a href="Uden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uden</a>, 21 miles (34 km) north of <a href="Eindhoven" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eindhoven</a>.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> Tabak's childhood next-door neighbour, John Massoeurs, described him after the trial as an intelligent &quot;introverted&quot; loner. Tabak studied at <a href="Eindhoven_University_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Eindhoven University of Technology</a> from 1996, graduating with an <a href="Master_of_Science" title="wikilink">MSc</a> in architecture, building and planning in 2003, then began a <a href="PhD" class="uri" title="wikilink">PhD</a> in which his thesis was a study of how people use space in office buildings and public areas. The paper was published in 2008.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a><a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<p>Leaving university in 2007, he moved to the United Kingdom after taking a job at the headquarters of Buro Happold, an engineering consultancy firm in <a href="Bath,_Somerset" title="wikilink">Bath</a>, and settled in a flat in the town. He worked as a &quot;people flow analyst&quot;, a role which required him to examine how people move around public spaces such as schools, airports and sports stadiums. While living in Bath he established a relationship with a woman he first met through <em><a href="The_Guardian" title="wikilink">The Guardian's</a></em> online dating website <em>Soulmates</em>. She was later described by the newspaper as his first serious girlfriend; he paid tribute to her in the acknowledgements of his thesis: &quot;I am very happy she entered my life.&quot; The couple moved to a flat in Canynge Road, Bristol, in June 2009.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> Though Joanna Yeates and her partner moved into the neighbouring flat in Canynge Road in the autumn of 2010, she and Tabak did not meet prior to 17 December.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<p>In the months leading up to Yeates' death, Tabak had used his computer to research escort agencies during business trips in the United Kingdom and United States, and contacted several prostitutes by phone.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> He also viewed violent <a href="internet_pornography" title="wikilink">internet pornography</a> that depicted women being controlled by men, showing images of them being bound and gagged, held by the neck and choked. During the murder investigation, police found images of a woman who bore a striking resemblance to Yeates. In one scene she was shown pulling up a pink top to expose her bra and breasts. When Yeates was discovered, she was wearing a similarly arranged pink top.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> At Tabak's trial, prosecuting barrister Nigel Lickley QC, argued that the evidence of Tabak's activities should be provided to the jury: &quot;It might shed light on the need to hold a woman for long enough and the need to squeeze hard enough to take her life.&quot;<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> Details of Tabak's viewing of pornography were not included in the prosecution's case since the judge believed it did not prove that Tabak had acted with <a href="Premeditated_murder" title="wikilink">premeditation</a>.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> After the trial it was disclosed that images of <a href="child_pornography" title="wikilink">child pornography</a> had been found on Tabak's laptop.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="trial">Trial</h3>
<p>The trial of Vincent Tabak started on 4 October 2011 at the <a href="Bristol_Crown_Court" title="wikilink">Crown Court at Bristol</a> before Mr Justice Field and a jury.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> His counsel in the trial was William Clegg <a href="Queen&#39;s_Counsel" title="wikilink">QC</a><a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> and the prosecutor was Nigel Lickley QC.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> Tabak pleaded guilty to <a href="manslaughter" class="uri" title="wikilink">manslaughter</a>, but denied murder.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a><a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
<p>The prosecution case was that Tabak had strangled Yeates at her flat within minutes of her arrival home on 17 December 2010,<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> using &quot;sufficient force&quot; to kill her.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> The trial was told that Tabak &lt;U+2013&gt; around  taller than Yeates &lt;U+2013&gt; had used his height and build to overpower her, pinning her to the floor by the wrists, and that she had suffered 43 separate injuries to her head, neck, torso and arms during the struggle.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a><a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> Injuries included cuts and bruises, and a fractured nose.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> Lickley told the court that the struggle was lengthy, and her death would have been slow and painful.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> However, he did not offer an explanation for the reasoning behind Tabak's initial attack on Yeates.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
<p>Evidence was presented that Tabak had then tried to conceal the crime by disposing of her body.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> The court heard that <a href="DNA" class="uri" title="wikilink">DNA</a> swabs taken from Yeates' body had provided a match with Tabak.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Samples found behind the knees of her jeans indicated she may have been held by the legs as she was carried, while fibres suggested contact with Tabak's coat and car. Blood stains were found on a wall overlooking a quarry close to where Yeates was discovered.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> The prosecution also said that Tabak attempted to implicate Chrisopher Jefferies for the murder during the police investigation, and that in the days following Yeates' death, he had made internet searches for topics that included the length of time a body takes to decompose and the dates of refuse collections in the Clifton area.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a><a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
<p>In his defence, Tabak claimed that the killing had not been sexually motivated,<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a><a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> and told the court that he had killed Yeates while trying to silence her after she screamed when he tried to kiss her. He claimed that Yeates had made a &quot;flirty comment&quot; and invited him to drink with her. He said that after she screamed he held his hands over her mouth and around her neck to silence her.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> He denied suggestions of a struggle,<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> claiming to have held Yeates by the neck with only minimal force, and &quot;for about 20 seconds&quot;.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> He told the court that after dumping the body he was &quot;in a state of panic&quot;.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
<p>The jury was sent out to deliberate on 26 October,<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> and returned with a verdict two days later.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> On 28 October 2011, Tabak was found guilty of Joanna Yeates' murder by a 10 to 2 majority verdict.

<h2 id="media-controversy">Media controversy</h2>
<p>The nature in which certain aspects of the case were reported by the British media led to one television broadcaster being temporarily banned from attending press conferences,<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> and the instigation of legal proceedings against several newspapers by both Yeates' former landlord,<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> and the Attorney General.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>
