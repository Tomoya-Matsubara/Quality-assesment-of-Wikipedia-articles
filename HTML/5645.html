It lies within the <a href="London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets" title="wikilink">London Borough of Tower Hamlets</a>, separated from the eastern edge of the <a href="City_of_London" title="wikilink">City of London</a> by the open space known as <a href="Tower_Hill" title="wikilink">Tower Hill</a>. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the <a href="Norman_Conquest_of_England" title="wikilink">Norman Conquest of England</a>. The <a href="White_Tower_(Tower_of_London)" title="wikilink">White Tower</a>, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by <a href="William_I_of_England" title="wikilink">William the Conqueror</a> in 1078, and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. Since at least 1100, the castle has been used as a prison, although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a <a href="moat" class="uri" title="wikilink">moat</a>. There were several phases of expansion, mainly under Kings <a href="Richard_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Richard the Lionheart</a>, <a href="Henry_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry III</a>, and <a href="Edward_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Edward I</a> in the 12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site.</p>
<p>The Tower of London has played a prominent role in England's history. It was besieged several times and controlling it has been important to controlling the country. The Tower has served variously as an <a href="armory_(military)" title="wikilink">armoury</a>, a <a href="treasury" class="uri" title="wikilink">treasury</a>, a menagerie, the home of the <a href="Royal_Mint" title="wikilink">Royal Mint</a>, a public records office, and the home of the <a href="Crown_Jewels_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom</a>. From the early 14th century until the reign of <a href="Charles_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles II</a>, a procession would be led from the Tower to <a href="Westminster_Abbey" title="wikilink">Westminster Abbey</a> on the coronation of a monarch. In the absence of the monarch, the <a href="Constable_of_the_Tower" title="wikilink">Constable of the Tower</a> is in charge of the castle. This was a powerful and trusted position in the medieval period. In the late 15th century the castle was the prison of the <a href="Princes_in_the_Tower" title="wikilink">Princes in the Tower</a>. Under the <a href="Tudor_period" title="wikilink">Tudors</a>, the Tower became used less as a royal residence, and despite attempts to refortify and repair the castle its defences lagged behind developments to deal with artillery.</p>
<p>The zenith of the castle's use as a prison came in the 16th and 17th centuries, when many figures fallen into disgrace, such as <a href="Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Elizabeth I</a> before she became queen, were held within its walls. This use has led to the phrase &quot;<a href="wikt:sent_to_the_Tower" title="wikilink">sent to the Tower</a>&quot;. Despite its enduring reputation as a place of torture and death, popularised by 16th-century religious propagandists and 19th-century writers, only seven people were executed within the Tower before the World Wars of the 20th century. Executions were more commonly held on the notorious Tower Hill to the north of the castle, with 112 occurring there over a 400-year period. In the latter half of the century, institutions such as the Royal Mint moved out of the castle to other locations, leaving many buildings empty. <a href="Anthony_Salvin" title="wikilink">Anthony Salvin</a> and <a href="John_Taylor_(architect)" title="wikilink">John Taylor</a> took the opportunity to restore the Tower to what was felt to be its medieval appearance, clearing out many of the vacant post-medieval structures. In the First and Second World Wars, the Tower was again used as a prison, and witnessed the executions of 12 men for espionage. After the wars, damage caused during <a href="the_Blitz" title="wikilink">the Blitz</a> was repaired and the castle reopened to the public. Today the Tower of London is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions. It is cared for by the charity <a href="Historic_Royal_Palaces" title="wikilink">Historic Royal Palaces</a> and is protected as a <a href="World_Heritage_Site" title="wikilink">World Heritage Site</a>.</p>

The innermost contains the White Tower and is the earliest phase of the castle; encircling it to the north, east, and west is the inner enclosure, built during the reign of <a href="Richard_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Richard the Lionheart</a> (1189&lt;U+2013&gt;1199). Finally, there is the outer ward which encompasses the castle and was built under <a href="Edward_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Edward I</a>.

<h3 id="white-tower">White Tower</h3>

<p><img src="Whitetowerlondon.jpg" title="fig:The original entrance to the White Tower was at first-floor level." alt="The original entrance to the White Tower was at first-floor level." /> The White Tower is a <a href="keep" class="uri" title="wikilink">keep</a> (also known as a <a href="donjon" class="uri" title="wikilink">donjon</a>); this was often the strongest structure in a medieval castle, and contained lodgings suitable for the lord&lt;U+2014&gt;in this case the king or his representative.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> According to military historian Allen Brown, &quot;The great tower [White Tower] was also, by virtue of its strength, majesty and lordly accommodation, the donjon <em>par excellence</em>&quot;;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> one of the largest keeps in the <a href="Christendom" title="wikilink">Christian world</a>,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> it has been described as &quot;the most complete eleventh-century palace in Europe&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> At the western corners are square towers, while the round north-east tower houses a spiral staircase. The presence of a chapel in the south-east corner resulted in a semi-circular projection to accommodate the <a href="apse" class="uri" title="wikilink">apse</a>. Excluding these, the White Tower measures  at the base, and rises to a height of  at the southern battlements. As the building was intended to be a comfortable residence as well as a stronghold, latrines were built into the walls, and four fireplaces provided warmth.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The main building material is <a href="Kent" title="wikilink">Kentish</a> <a href="rag-stone" title="wikilink">ragstone</a>, although some local <a href="mudstone" class="uri" title="wikilink">mudstone</a> was also used. Although little survives, <a href="Caen_stone" title="wikilink">Caen stone</a> was imported from northern France to provide details in the Tower's facing, much of it replaced by <a href="Portland_stone" title="wikilink">Portland stone</a> in the 17th and 18th centuries. The structure was originally three-storeys high, comprising a basement floor, an entrance level, and an upper floor. The entrance in <a href="Norman_architecture" title="wikilink">Norman</a> keeps was usually above ground and accessed via a wooden staircase which could be removed in the event of an attack; in the White Tower's case, this was in the south face. During <a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry II</a>'s reign (1154&lt;U+2013&gt;1189), a forebuilding was added to the south side of the tower to provide extra defences to the entrance, but it has not survived. Each floor was divided into three chambers, the largest in the west, a smaller room in the north-east, and the chapel taking up the entrance and upper floors of the south-east.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> As most of the Tower's windows were enlarged in the 18th century, only two original &lt;U+2013&gt; albeit restored &lt;U+2013&gt; examples remain, in the south wall at gallery level.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The tower was terraced into the side of a mound, so the northern side of the basement is partially below ground level.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> As was typical of most keeps,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> the bottom floor was an <a href="undercroft" class="uri" title="wikilink">undercroft</a> used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18th century when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber <a href="vault_(architecture)" title="wikilink">vaults</a> were replaced with brick counterparts.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The basement is lit through small slits.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Wakefield_Tower_Chapel_-_Tower_of_London.jpg" title="fig:Norman chapel inside the White Tower" alt="Norman chapel inside the White Tower" /> The entrance floor was probably intended for the use of the <a href="Constable_of_the_Tower" title="wikilink">Constable of the Tower</a> and other important officials. The south entrance was blocked during the 17th century, and not reopened until 1973. Those heading to the upper floor had to pass through a smaller chamber to the east, also connected to the entrance floor. The <a href="crypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">crypt</a> of St John's Chapel occupied the south-east corner and was accessible only from the eastern chamber. There is a recess in the north wall of the crypt; according to Geoffrey Parnell, Keeper of the Tower History at the Royal Armouries, &quot;the windowless form and restricted access, suggest that it was designed as a strong-room for safekeeping of royal treasures and important documents&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The upper floor contained a grand hall in the west and residential chamber in the east both originally open to the roof and surrounded by a gallery built into the wall and St John's Chapel in the south-east. A new floor level was inserted into the top level in the 15th century, along with the present roof.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> St John's Chapel was not part of the White Tower's original design, as the apsidal projection was built after the basement walls.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Due to changes in function and design since the tower's construction, except for the chapel little is left of the original interior.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The chapel's current bare and unadorned appearance is reminiscent of how it would have been in the Norman period. In the 13th century, during Henry III's reign, the chapel was decorated with such ornamentation as a gold-painted cross, and <a href="stained_glass" title="wikilink">stained glass</a> windows that depicted the Virgin Mary and Holy Trinity.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="innermost-ward">Innermost ward</h3>
<p>The innermost ward encloses an area immediately south of the White Tower, stretching to what was once the edge of the River Thames. As was the case at other castles, such as the 11th-century <a href="Hen_Domen" title="wikilink">Hen Domen</a>, the innermost ward was probably filled with timber buildings from the Tower's foundation. Exactly when the royal lodgings began to encroach from the White Tower into the innermost ward is uncertain, although it had happened by the 1170s.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The lodgings were renovated and elaborated during the 1220s and 1230s, becoming comparable with other palatial residences such as <a href="Windsor_Castle" title="wikilink">Windsor Castle</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Construction of Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers &lt;U+2013&gt; located at the corners of the innermost ward's wall along the river &lt;U+2013&gt; began around 1220.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|Wakefield Tower was originally called Blundeville Tower.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} They probably served as private residences for the queen and king respectively. The earliest evidence for how the royal chambers were decorated comes from Henry III's reign: the queen's chamber was whitewashed, and painted with flowers and imitation stonework. A <a href="great_hall" title="wikilink">great hall</a> existed in the south of the ward, between the two towers.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> It was similar to, although slightly smaller than, that also built by Henry III at <a href="Winchester_Castle" title="wikilink">Winchester Castle</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Near Wakefield Tower was a <a href="postern_gate" title="wikilink">postern gate</a> which allowed private access to the king's apartments. The innermost ward was originally surrounded by a protective ditch, which had been filled in by the 1220s. Around this time, a kitchen was built in the ward.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Between 1666 and 1676, the innermost ward was transformed and the palace buildings removed.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The area around the White Tower was cleared so that anyone approaching would have to cross open ground. The Jewel House was demolished, and the <a href="Crown_Jewels_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Crown Jewels</a> moved to Martin Tower.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="inner-ward">Inner ward</h3>

<p><img src="South_face_of_the_Waterloo_Barracks,_Tower_of_London,_2009.jpg" title="fig:The south face of the Waterloo Barracks" alt="The south face of the Waterloo Barracks" /> The inner ward was created during Richard the Lionheart's reign, when a moat was dug to the west of the innermost ward, effectively doubling the castle's size.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Henry III created the ward's east and north walls, and the ward's dimensions remain to this day.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Most of Henry's work survives, and only two of the nine towers he constructed have been completely rebuilt.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Between the Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers, the innermost ward's wall also serves as a <a href="curtain_wall_(fortification)" title="wikilink">curtain wall</a> for the inner ward.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The main entrance to the inner ward would have been through a <a href="gatehouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">gatehouse</a>, most likely in the west wall on the site of what is now Beauchamp Tower. The inner ward's western curtain wall was rebuilt by Edward I.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The 13th-century Beauchamp Tower marks the first large scale use of brick as a building material in Britain, since the 5th-century departure of the Romans.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The Beauchamp Tower is one of 13 towers that stud the curtain wall. Anti-clockwise from the south-west corner they are: Bell, Beauchamp, Devereux, Flint, Bowyer, Brick, Martin, Constable, Broad Arrow, Salt, Lanthorn, Wakefield, and the Bloody Tower.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> While these towers provided positions from which <a href="enfilade_and_defilade" title="wikilink">flanking fire</a> could by deployed against a potential enemy, they also contained accommodation. As its name suggests, Bell Tower housed a belfry, its purpose to raise the alarm in the event of an attack. The royal bow-maker, responsible for making <a href="English_longbow" title="wikilink">longbows</a>, <a href="crossbow" title="wikilink">crossbows</a>, <a href="catapult" title="wikilink">catapults</a>, and other siege and hand weapons, had a workshop in the Bowyer Tower. A turret at the top of Lanthorn Tower was used as a beacon by traffic approaching the Tower at night.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>As a result of Henry's expansion, <a href="St._Peter_ad_Vincula_(London)" title="wikilink">St Peter ad Vincula</a>, a Norman chapel which had previously stood outside the Tower, was incorporated into the castle. Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls for himself and his queen.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> It was rebuilt by Edward I at a cost of over &lt;U+00A3&gt;300 (about &lt;U+00A3&gt;142,000 as of 2008),{{#tag:ref|Comparing relative <a href="purchasing_power" title="wikilink">purchasing power</a> of &lt;U+00A3&gt;300 in 1290 with 2008<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and again by <a href="Henry_VIII_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry VIII</a> in 1519; the current building dates from this period, although the chapel was refurbished in the 19th century.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Immediately west of Wakefield Tower, the Bloody Tower was built at the same time as the inner ward's curtain wall, and as a water-gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames.

<p>A third ward was created during Edward I's extension to the Tower, as the narrow enclosure completely surrounded the castle. At the same time a <a href="bastion" class="uri" title="wikilink">bastion</a> known as Legge's Mount was built at the castle's north-west corner. Brass Mount, the bastion in the north-east corner, was a later addition. The three rectangular towers along the east wall  apart were dismantled in 1843. Although the bastions have often been ascribed to the Tudor period, there is no evidence to support this; archaeological investigations suggest that Legge's Mount is Edwardian.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Blocked <a href="battlements" class="uri" title="wikilink">battlements</a> (also known as crenellations) in the south side of Legge's Mount are the only surviving medieval battlements at the Tower of London (the rest are Victorian replacements).<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> A new  moat was dug beyond the castle's new limits;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> it was originally  deeper in the middle than it is today.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> With the addition of a new curtain wall, the old main entrance to the Tower of London was obscured and made redundant; a new entrance was created in the south-west corner of the external wall circuit.

The building is unique in England, and the closest parallel is the now demolished water-gate at the <a href="Louvre" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louvre</a> in Paris.

Although he is the first recorded prisoner held in the Tower, he was also the first person to escape from it, using a smuggled rope secreted in a butt of wine. He was held in luxury and permitted servants, but on 2 February 1101 he hosted a banquet for his captors. After plying them with drink, when no one was looking he lowered himself from a secluded chamber, and out of the Tower.

<p>The <em><a href="Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a></em> records that in 1097 King <a href="William_II_of_England" title="wikilink">William II</a> ordered a wall to be built around the Tower of London; it was probably built from stone and likely replaced the timber palisade that arced around the north and west sides of the castle, between the Roman wall and the Thames.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> The Norman Conquest of London manifested itself not only with a new ruling class, but in the way the city was structured.

<p>The death in 1135 of <a href="Henry_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry I</a> left England with a disputed succession; although the king had persuaded his most powerful barons to swear support for the <a href="Empress_Matilda" title="wikilink">Empress Matilda</a>, just a few days after his death <a href="Stephen_of_England" title="wikilink">Stephen of Blois</a> arrived from France to lay claim to the throne. The importance of the city and its Tower is marked by the speed at which he secured London. The castle, which had not been used as a royal residence for some time, was usually left in the charge of a <a href="Constable_of_the_Tower" title="wikilink">Constable</a>, a post held at this time by <a href="Geoffrey_de_Mandeville,_1st_Earl_of_Essex" title="wikilink"> Geoffrey de Mandeville</a>. As the Tower was considered an impregnable fortress in a strategically important position, possession was highly valued. Mandeville exploited this, selling his allegiance to Matilda after Stephen was captured in 1141 at the <a href="First_Battle_of_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Battle of Lincoln</a>. Once her support waned, the following year he resold his loyalty to Stephen. Through his role as Constable of the Tower, Mandeville became &quot;the richest and most powerful man in England&quot;.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> When he tried the same ploy again, this time holding secret talks with Matilda, Stephen had him arrested, forced him to cede control of his castles, and replaced him with one of his most loyal supporters. Until then the position had been hereditary, originally held by <a href="Geoffrey_de_Mandeville_(11th_century)" title="wikilink">Geoffrey de Mandeville</a> (a friend of William the Conqueror's and ancestor of the Geoffrey that Stephen and Matilda dealt with), but the position's authority was such that from then on it remained in the hands of an appointee of the monarch. The position was usually given to someone of great importance, who might not always be at the castle due to other duties. Although the Constable was still responsible for maintaining the castle and its garrison, from an early stage he had a subordinate to help with this duty: the Lieutenant of the Tower.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Constables also had civic duties relating to the city. Usually they were given control of the city and were responsible for levying taxes, enforcing the law and maintaining order. The creation in 1191 of the position of <a href="Lord_Mayor_of_London" title="wikilink">Lord Mayor of London</a> removed many of the Constable's civic powers, and at times led to friction between the two.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>

<p>The castle probably retained its form as established by 1100 until the reign of Richard the Lionheart (1189&lt;U+2013&gt;1199).<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> The castle was extended under <a href="William_Longchamp" title="wikilink">William Longchamp</a>, Richard's <a href="Lord_Chancellor" title="wikilink">Lord Chancellor</a> and the man in charge of England while he was on crusade.

The Tower of London was Longchamp's main fortress, so he made it as strong as possible. His new fortifications were first tested in October 1191, when the Tower was besieged for the first time in its history. Longchamp capitulated to John after just three days, deciding he had more to gain from surrender than prolonging the siege.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>

The outer curtain walls were erected in the 13th century." /> The Tower was besieged for a second time in 1214. John had succeeded Richard as king in 1199, but his tyrannical rule was unpopular with many of his <a href="baron" title="wikilink">barons</a> who moved against him in response. While the King was at Windsor Castle, <a href="Robert_Fitzwalter" title="wikilink">Robert Fitzwalter</a> led an army into London and laid siege to the Tower. Although under-garrisoned, the Tower resisted and the siege was lifted once John signed the <a href="Magna_Carta" title="wikilink">Magna Carta</a>.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> The king eventually reneged on his promises of reform, leading to the outbreak of the <a href="First_Barons&#39;_War" title="wikilink">First Barons' War</a>. Even after the Magna Carta had been signed, Fitzwalter maintained his control of London. During the war, the Tower's garrison joined forces with the barons. John was deposed in 1216 and the barons offered the English throne to Prince <a href="Louis_VIII_of_France" title="wikilink">Louis</a>, the eldest son of the French king. However, after John's death in October 1216, many began to support the claim of Prince <a href="Henry_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry</a>, John's oldest son. War continued between the factions supporting Louis and Henry, with Fitzwalter supporting Louis. Fitzwalter was still in control of London and the Tower, both of which held out until it was clear that Henry's supporters would prevail.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 13th century, Kings <a href="Henry_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry III</a> (1216&lt;U+2013&gt;1272) and <a href="Edward_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Edward I</a> (1272&lt;U+2013&gt;1307) extended the castle, essentially creating it as it stands today.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Henry was disconnected from his barons, and a mutual lack of understanding led to unrest and resentment towards his rule. As a result, he was eager to ensure the Tower of London was a formidable fortification; at the same time Henry was an <a href="aestheticism" title="wikilink">aesthete</a> and wished to make the castle a comfortable place to live.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> From 1216 to 1227 nearly &lt;U+00A3&gt;10,000 was spent on the Tower of London; in this period, only the work at Windsor Castle cost more (&lt;U+00A3&gt;15,000). Most of this work was focussed on the palatial buildings of the innermost ward.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> The tradition of whitewashing the White Tower (from which it derives its name) began in 1240.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p>Beginning around 1238, the castle expanded to the east, north, and north-west. The work lasted through the reign of Henry III and into that of Edward I, with interruptions due to civil unrest. A new defensive perimeter studded with towers was created. On the west, north, and east sides where the wall was not defended by the river, a ditch was created. The eastern extension took the castle beyond the bounds of the old Roman settlement, marked by the city wall which had been incorporated into the castle's defences.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> The Tower had long been a symbol of oppression, despised by Londoners, and Henry's building programme was unpopular.

<p>Henry III often held court at the Tower of London, and held parliament there on at least two occasions (1236 and 1261) when he felt that the barons were becoming dangerously unruly. In 1258, the discontented barons, led by <a href="Simon_de_Montfort,_6th_Earl_of_Leicester" title="wikilink">Simon de Montfort</a>, forced the King to agree to reforms including holding regular parliaments. Relinquishing the Tower of London was among the conditions. Henry III resented losing power and sought permission from the pope to break his oath. With the backing of mercenaries, Henry installed himself in the Tower in 1261. While negotiations continued with the barons, the King ensconced himself in the castle, although no army moved to take it. A truce was agreed with the condition that the King handed over control of the Tower once again. Henry won a significant victory at the <a href="Battle_of_Evesham" title="wikilink">Battle of Evesham</a> in 1265, allowing him to regain control of the country and the Tower of London. Cardinal <a href="Pope_Adrian_V" title="wikilink">Ottobuon</a> came to England to excommunicate those who were still rebellious; the act was deeply unpopular and the situation was exacerbated when the cardinal was granted custody of the Tower. <a href="Gilbert_de_Clare,_6th_Earl_of_Hertford" title="wikilink">Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford</a>, marched on London in April 1267 and laid siege to the castle, declaring that custody of the Tower was &quot;not a post to be trusted in the hands of a foreigner, much less of an ecclesiastic&quot;.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Despite a large army and siege engines, Gilbert de Clare was unable to take the castle.

This had not always been the case. As a royal castle, it was used by the monarch to imprison people for various reasons, however these were usually high-status individuals for short periods rather than common citizenry as there were plenty of prisons elsewhere for such people. Contrary to the popular image of the Tower, prisoners were able to make their life easier by purchasing amenities such as better food or tapestries through the Lieutenant of the Tower.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> As holding prisoners was originally an incidental role of the Tower &lt;U+2013&gt; as would have been the case for any castle &lt;U+2013&gt; there was no purpose-built accommodation for prisoners until 1687 when a brick shed, a &quot;Prison for Soldiers&quot;, was built to the north-west of the White Tower.

The two bodies were resident at the Tower from at least 1454, and by 16th century they had moved to a position in the inner ward.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> Political tensions between <a href="Charles_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles I</a> and Parliament in the second quarter of the 17th century led to an attempt by forces loyal to the King to secure the Tower and its valuable contents, including money and munitions. London's <a href="Trainband" title="wikilink">Trained Bands</a>, a militia force, were moved into the castle in 1640. Plans for defence were drawn up and gun platforms were built, readying the Tower for war. The preparations were never put to the test. In 1642, Charles I attempted to arrest five Members of Parliament. When this failed he fled the city, and Parliament retaliated by removing Sir <a href="John_Byron,_1st_Baron_Byron" title="wikilink">John Byron</a>, the Lieutenant of the Tower. The Trained Bands had switched sides, and now supported Parliament; together with the London citizenry, they blockaded the Tower. With permission from the King, Byron relinquished control of the Tower. Parliament replaced Byron with a man of their own choosing, Sir <a href="Conyers_Baronets" title="wikilink">John Conyers</a>.

<p>When the <a href="House_of_Hanover" title="wikilink">Hanoverian dynasty</a> ascended the throne, their situation was uncertain and with a possible Scottish rebellion in mind, the Tower of London was repaired. Gun platforms added under the Stuarts had decayed. The number of guns at the Tower was reduced from 118 to 45, and one contemporary commentator noted that the castle &quot;would not hold out four and twenty hours against an army prepared for a siege&quot;.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> For the most part, the 18th-century work on the defences was spasmodic and piecemeal, although a new gateway in the southern curtain wall permitting access from the wharf to the outer ward was added in 1774. The moat surrounding the castle had become silted over the centuries since it was created despite attempts at clearing it. It was still an integral part of the castle's defences, so in 1830 the Constable of the Tower, the <a href="Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington" title="wikilink">Duke of Wellington</a>, ordered a large-scale clearance of several feet of silt. However this did not prevent an outbreak of disease in the garrison in 1841 caused by poor water supply, resulting in several deaths. To prevent the festering ditch posing further health problems, it was ordered that the moat should be drained and filled with earth. The work began in 1843 and was mostly complete two years later. The construction of the Waterloo Barracks in the inner ward began in 1845, when the Duke of Wellington laid the foundation stone. The building could accommodate 1,000 men; at the same time, separate quarters for the officers were built to the north-east of the White Tower. The building is now the headquarters of the <a href="Royal_Fusiliers" title="wikilink">Royal Regiment of Fusiliers</a>.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> The popularity of the <a href="Chartism" title="wikilink">Chartist movement</a> between 1828 and 1858 led to a desire to refortify the Tower of London in the event of civil unrest.

Only the Wakefield and St Thomas' Towers survive.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> The 18th century marked an increasing interest in England's medieval past. One of the effects was the emergence of <a href="Gothic_Revival_architecture" title="wikilink">Gothic Revival architecture</a>. In the Tower's architecture, this was manifest when the New Horse Armoury was built in 1825 against the south face of the White Tower.

In 1855 the War Office took over responsibility for manufacture and storage of weapons from the Ordnance Office, which was gradually phased out of the castle. At the same time, there was greater interest in the history of the Tower of London.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a></p>
<p>Public interest was partly fuelled by contemporary writers, of whom the work of <a href="William_Harrison_Ainsworth" title="wikilink">William Harrison Ainsworth</a> was particularly influential.

<p><img src="Imperial_State_Crown2.JPG" title="fig:The Imperial State Crown" alt="The Imperial State Crown" /> The tradition of housing the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London probably dates from the reign of Henry III. The Jewel House was built specifically to house the royal regalia, including jewels, plate, and symbols of royalty such as the crown, sceptre, and sword. When money needed to be raised, the treasure could be pawned by the monarch. The treasure allowed the monarch independence from the aristocracy, and consequently was closely guarded. A new position for &quot;keeper of the jewels, armouries and other things&quot; was created,<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> which was well rewarded; in the reign of Edward III (1312&lt;U+2013&gt;1377) the holder was paid 12d a day. The position grew to include other duties including purchasing royal jewels, gold, and silver, and appointing royal goldsmiths and jewellers.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> In 1649, during the <a href="English_Civil_War" title="wikilink">English Civil War</a>, the contents of the Jewel House were disposed of along with other royal properties. Metal items were sent to the Mint to be melted down and reused, and the crowns were &quot;totallie broken and defaced&quot;.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> When the monarchy was <a href="Restoration_(England)" title="wikilink">restored</a> in 1660, the only surviving items of the coronation regalia were a 12th-century spoon and three ceremonial swords. The rest of the Crown Jewels had to be recreated. In 1669, the Jewel House was demolished<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> and the Crown Jewels moved into Martin Tower where they could be viewed by the paying public. This was exploited two years later when Colonel <a href="Thomas_Blood" title="wikilink">Thomas Blood</a> attempted to steal them.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> Blood and his accomplices bound and gagged the Jewel House keeper. Although they laid their hands on the Imperial State Crown, Sceptre and Orb, they were foiled when the keeper's son turned up unexpectedly and raised the alarm.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a><a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a> The Crown Jewels are currently stored in the Waterloo Barracks at the Tower.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="menagerie">Menagerie</h2>
<p>The Royal Menagerie is first referenced during the reign of Henry III. In 1251, the sheriffs were ordered to pay fourpence a day towards the upkeep for the King's polar bear; the bear attracted a great deal of attention from Londoners when it went fishing in the Thames. In 1254, the sheriffs were ordered to subsidise the construction of an elephant house at the Tower.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|The elephant, a gift from the king of France, died after just two years in England.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} The exact location of the medieval menagerie is unknown, although the lions were kept in the <a href="barbican" class="uri" title="wikilink">barbican</a> known as Lion Tower.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a> The royal collection was swelled by diplomatic gifts including three leopards from the Holy Roman Emperor.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> By the 18th century, the menagerie was open to the public; admission cost three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to <a href="Regents_Park" title="wikilink">Regents Park</a>, after one of the lions was accused of biting a soldier.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> The Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequentially, even though the animals had long since left the building, the Lion Tower was not demolished until the last keeper's death in 1853.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="ghosts">Ghosts</h2>
<p>The ghost of Queen Anne Boleyn, beheaded in 1536 for treason against King Henry VIII, allegedly haunts the chapel of St Peter and Vincula, where she is buried, and has been seen walking around the White Tower carrying her head under her arm.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> Other ghosts include Henry VI, Lady Jane Grey, <a href="Margaret_Pole,_8th_Countess_of_Salisbury" title="wikilink">Margaret Pole</a>, and the Princes in the Tower.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> In January 1816, a sentry on guard outside the Jewel House witnessed an inexplicable apparition of a bear advancing towards him, and reportedly died of fright a few days later.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> In October 1817, an even more inexplicable, tubular, glowing apparition was seen in the Jewel House by the Keeper of the Crown Jewels, Edmund Lenthal Swifte. The apparition hovered over the shoulder of his wife, leading her to exclaim: &quot;Oh, Christ! it has seized me!&quot; Other nameless and formless terrors have been reported, more recently, by night staff at the Tower.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a></p>
