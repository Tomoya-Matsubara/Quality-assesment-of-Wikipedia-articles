<p>The <strong>1999-00 <a href="Southern_Hemisphere" title="wikilink">Southern Hemisphere</a> tropical cyclone season</strong> ran year-round from <a href="July_1" title="wikilink">July 1</a>, <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a> to <a href="June_30" title="wikilink">June 30</a>, <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a>, reaching its peak mid-February to early March.</p>
<p>Cyclones Leon-Eline, Steve and Rosita were some of the most notable cyclones of the season. <a href="Cyclone_Leon-Eline" title="wikilink">Cyclone Leon-Eline</a> existed for 22 days, while transversing the whole <a href="Indian_Ocean" title="wikilink">Indian Ocean</a>, and causing severe flooding in <a href="Madagascar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madagascar</a> and <a href="Mozambique" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mozambique</a>. <a href="Cyclone_Steve" title="wikilink">Cyclone Steve</a> transversed the entire <a href="Australia" title="wikilink">Australian</a> continent, and although a fairly weak cyclone, caused widespread flooding in <a href="Queensland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queensland</a>, <a href="Northern_Territory" title="wikilink">Northern Territory</a> and <a href="Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Western Australia</a>. <a href="Cyclone_Rosita" title="wikilink">Cyclone Rosita</a> made an almost direct hit on <a href="Broome,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Broome</a> as a severe Category 5 cyclone, devastating several remote stations and the town itself.

The disturbance was upgraded to tropical depression status on <a href="25_December" title="wikilink">25 December</a> 1800 hours (UTC), and upgraded to moderate tropical storm intensity on <a href="26_December" title="wikilink">26 December</a> and named Astride. It moved to the west south-west and reached severe tropical storm intensity on <a href="27_December" title="wikilink">27 December</a> 0000 (UTC) with 10-min MSW near 50 kts, located 190 nm north-east of St. Brandon. Astride slowed its forward motion while intensifying (JTWC estimated 1-min winds of 65 kts). Astride began to slowly weaken from early <a href="28_December" title="wikilink">28 December</a>. On <a href="30_December" title="wikilink">30 December</a> Astride intensified and was upgraded again to severe tropical storm intensity while moving to the west north-west, but downgraded again to moderate storm intensity at 1800 (UTC) on the same day. Astride made landfall between 1800 (UTC) on <a href="31_December" title="wikilink">31 December</a> and 0000 (UTC) on <a href="1_January" title="wikilink">1 January</a>, <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a> 30 nm northeast of Vohemar, <a href="Madagascar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madagascar</a>. It moved into the <a href="Mozambique_Channel" title="wikilink">Mozambique Channel</a> and intensified briefly, but weakened again, and made another landfall near Mogincual, <a href="Mozambique" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mozambique</a> at 0000 (UTC) on <a href="3_January" title="wikilink">3 January</a>. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Severe Tropical Storm Astride is the only known cyclone in history to exist in two different millenia, forming on <a href="December_24" title="wikilink">December 24</a>, <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a> and dissipated on <a href="January_3" title="wikilink">January 3</a>, <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a>.</p>
<h3 id="tropical-cyclone-babiola">Tropical Cyclone Babiola</h3>

<p>An area of convection formed 130 nm south south-east of <a href="Diego_Garcia" title="wikilink">Diego Garcia</a>. It moved eastward, then moved southwest and strengthened. MFR upgraded to a depression on the 6th at 0000 (UTC) and upgraded to Moderate Tropical Storm Babiola at 0600 (UTC) on the same day. It continued to move south-west, then accelerated more to the west southwest while reaching cyclone strength on <a href="7_January" title="wikilink">7 January</a> at 1200 (UTC), centred 575 nm south of Diego Garcia. Babiola reached peak intensity late on <a href="9_january" title="wikilink">9 january</a> and a ragged eye appeared 20 nm in diameter. JTWC estimated 1-min winds of 90 kts, and MFR estimated 10-min winds of 80 kts and a minimum central pressure of 954 mb. Babiola moved southward on the 10th and began to weaken and became elongated. It continued to weaken on the 11th while moving to the south south-east and becoming extra-tropical. JTWC issued its last warning on <a href="12_January" title="wikilink">12 January</a> at 0600 (UTC). No damage was reported. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="intense-tropical-cyclone-connie">Intense Tropical Cyclone Connie</h3>

<p>An area of convection appeared on <a href="24_January" title="wikilink">24 January</a>. It quickly strengthened to tropical storm status on the 25th at 1800 (UTC) and was named Connie. The storm moved northward a bit, but remained quasi-stationary about 380 nm north north-west of Mauritius. MFR upgraded Connie to cyclone status with 80 kt winds. Connie strengthened rapidly and on <a href="27_January" title="wikilink">27 January</a>, a well-defined eye 15 nm wide was located 235 nm northwest of <a href="Mauritius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mauritius</a>. JTWC estimated 1-min winds of 115 kts, and MFR estimated 10-min winds of 100 kts and a minimum central pressure of 928 mb on <a href="28_January" title="wikilink">28 January</a>. Connie moved to the south west which carried it 100 nm west of <a href="Reunion" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reunion</a> and began weakening. Connie recurved to the south south-east on the 30th. On the 31st Connie held on its intensity of 55 kts, then rapidly weakened on <a href="1_February" title="wikilink">1 February</a> and was taking on extratropical characteristics while moving south-eastward.</p>
<p>Connie affected the islands of <a href="Mauritius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mauritius</a> and <a href="Reunion" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reunion</a>, dumping rainfall up to 200mm. In Mauritius, this provided some relief for the drought-stricken island, but was still not enough. Connie was responsible for two deaths in Reunion. One hundred homes were destroyed with at least 600 people homeless. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="moderate-tropical-storm-damienne">Moderate Tropical Storm Damienne</h3>

<p>On <a href="January_31" title="wikilink">January 31</a>, <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a> a low formed in the central south <a href="Indian_Ocean" title="wikilink">Indian Ocean</a> about 300 nm south-east of <a href="Diego_Garcia" title="wikilink">Diego Garcia</a>. On <a href="February_1" title="wikilink">February 1</a> the storm reached <a href="tropical_storm" title="wikilink">tropical storm</a> strength and was named Damienne. It moved southward with 1-min winds estimated at 45 kts by JTWC, and 10-min winds of 40 kts estimated by MFR. Although forecast to strengthen, the storm did not last long and it quickly dissipated on <a href="February_2" title="wikilink">February 2</a> while moving south-westward. <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> </p>

<h3 id="severe-tropical-storm-felicia">Severe Tropical Storm Felicia</h3>

<p>A low formed on <a href="17_February" title="wikilink">17 February</a> near 13&lt;U+02DA&gt;S, 81&lt;U+02DA&gt;E. It was classified a tropical storm br MFR on the 20th at 0000 (UTC) while located 500 nm south southeast of <a href="Diego_Garcia" title="wikilink">Diego Garcia</a> and was named Felicia. It moved west southwestward which later became south westward. It was temporarily downgraded to a depression at 1800 (UTC), but upgraded again 12 hours later. On <a href="23_February" title="wikilink">23 February</a>, it reached its peak intensity. JTWC estimated 1-min winds of 50 kts, but MFR estimated 10-min winds of 60 kts. Felicia continued to move to the south southwest, but it weakened rapidly thereafter. MFR issued its final warning on <a href="24_February" title="wikilink">24 February</a> at 0600 (UTC) as it transitioned into an extratropical low, located 665 nm south south-east of <a href="Rodrigues_Island" title="wikilink">Rodrigues Island</a>. <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="moderate-tropical-storm-gloria">Moderate Tropical Storm Gloria</h3>

<p>An area of convection east of northern <a href="Madagascar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madagascar</a> formed on <a href="27_February" title="wikilink">27 February</a>. MFR started issuing bulletins on <a href="28_February" title="wikilink">28 February</a> at 0600 (UTC) when the system was located 600 nm east of northern Madagascar. It was upgraded to a depression on <a href="29_February" title="wikilink">29 February</a> at 0000 (UTC) while moving westward, and started moving more northerly. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gloria on <a href="1_March" title="wikilink">1 March</a> at 0600 (UTC) and turned to the south-west at 9 kts. Gloria's centre made landfall near Antsirabe, Madagascar around 1800 (UTC). JTWC's estimated 1-min average sustained winds was 65 kts, based on infrared imagery showing a 15 nm wide closed eye along the coast. MFR's estimated 10-min average wind speed was somewhat lower at 45 kts. On <a href="2_March" title="wikilink">2 March</a> at 0600 (UTC), MFR issued its last warning. JTWC continued to monitor the system for the next three days as it drifted south-westward over Madagascar. JTWC was consistently forecasting re-intensification over the <a href="Mozambique_Channel" title="wikilink">Mozambique Channel</a>, but on <a href="5_March" title="wikilink">5 March</a>, the system weakened, and the final warning was written while over the Channel.</p>
<p>Tropical Storm Gloria brought heavy rainfall to northern Madagascar. Mananjary recordded 427 mm in a 48 hour period ending on <a href="5_March" title="wikilink">5 March</a>. The death toll was about 150. Andapa was the most affected city, with 40 people dead and 33 unaccounted for. Over 100 homes were destroyed in the city. The population was affected by an outbreak of cholera. The road linking this region to the capital was blocked, and this was expected to have a significant negative impact on the region's economy. <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="very-intense-tropical-cyclone-hudah">Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Hudah</h3>

<p>Cyclone Hudah was an intense and long-lived tropical cyclone that rampaged through the South Indian Ocean from <a href="March_24" title="wikilink">March 24</a> to <a href="April_9" title="wikilink">April 9</a>, causing massive damage in <a href="Madagascar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madagascar</a> and <a href="Mozambique" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mozambique</a>. Striking nearly the same area barely a month after <a href="Cyclone_Eline" title="wikilink">Cyclone Leon-Eline</a> roared through the two countries, the combination severely damaged the fragile economies of <a href="Southern_Africa" title="wikilink">Southern Africa</a>.  </p>
<h3 id="moderate-tropical-storm-innocente">Moderate Tropical Storm Innocente</h3>

<p>An area of disturbance was located on <a href="9_April" title="wikilink">9 April</a> between <a href="Cocos_(Keeling)_Islands" title="wikilink">Cocos (Keeling) Islands</a> and <a href="Christmas_Island" title="wikilink">Christmas Island</a>. It moved west for a few days. MFR began issuing bulletins, as the low crossed the 90 degree East <a href="longitude" class="uri" title="wikilink">longitude</a> line on <a href="12_April" title="wikilink">12 April</a> at 1800 (UTC). It still moved westward; on the 14th, it weakened, and the issuing of bulletins were temporarily stopped, however, they were re-instigated on the 15th, as it regenerated. JTWC began issuing warnings at 1800 (UTC) on the same day, while located 640 nm southeast of <a href="Diego_Garcia" title="wikilink">Diego Garcia</a>. At 1200 (UTC) on the <a href="16th_April" title="wikilink">16th April</a>, MFR upgraded to Tropical Storm Innocente, but was downgraded back to a depression six hours later. On <a href="17_April" title="wikilink">17 April</a> at 1800 (UTC), MFR upgraded to Tropical Storm Innocente again. It was still moving in a west south-westerly course and began to weaken. At 0000 (UTC) on the <a href="19th_April" title="wikilink">19th April</a>, MFR downgraded it to a depression, and wrote their final warning six hours later, while located 400 nm east northeast of <a href="Rodrigues_Island" title="wikilink">Rodrigues Island</a>. The remnant low remained for several days, but failed to show any redevelopment. <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> </p>

<h3 id="tropical-cyclone-ilsa">Tropical Cyclone Ilsa</h3>

<p>Ilsa formed to the northeast of the <a href="Cocos_Islands" title="wikilink">Cocos Islands</a> on the <a href="December_11" title="wikilink">December 11</a>, <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a>. The cyclone moved to the south of Christmas Island on the 13th producing a heavy swell which caused some damage. Its development was impeded by vertical <a href="windshear" class="uri" title="wikilink">windshear</a> for a large part of its lifetime. After a long track eastwards across the <a href="Indian_Ocean" title="wikilink">Indian Ocean</a> it eventually crossed the <a href="Western_Australian" title="wikilink">Western Australian</a> coastline on the Eighty Mile Beach near the Sandfire Roadhouse during the early afternoon of <a href="December_17" title="wikilink">December 17</a>, <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a>. Apart from producing heavy rainfall, Ilsa did not produce any significant damage. <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="severe-tropical-cyclone-john">Severe Tropical Cyclone John</h3>

<p>Tropical Cyclone John started as a low to the south-west of <a href="Timor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Timor</a> on <a href="9_December" title="wikilink">9 December</a> <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a>. It rapidly intensified and moved towards the <a href="Pilbara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pilbara</a> coast of <a href="Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Western Australia</a>. Just before landfall it was a severe <a href="Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" title="wikilink">category 5</a> storm with a central pressure of 915 hPa, with winds estimated at being up to 290 km/h. The cyclone crossed the coast just to the west of Whim Creek between <a href="Port_Hedland,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Port Hedland</a> and <a href="Karratha,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Karratha</a> on 8.30am (WST) <a href="December_15" title="wikilink">December 15</a>,<a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a>. At the time of coastal crossing, it was estimated to have a central pressure between 930 and 940 hPa. The cyclone moved inland before dissipating the next day.</p>
<p><a href="Port_Hedland,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Port Hedland</a> experienced gale force winds for a period of 18 hours and near storm force winds with gusts to 124 km/h were observed on <a href="December_15" title="wikilink">December 15</a> for most of the day. A maximum storm surge of 2 metres was recorded by the Port Hedland Authority at 6am WST. At <a href="Karratha,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Karratha</a>, on the western side of the circulation, the maximum wind gust recorded was 113 km/h. At Cape Lambert, winds averaged 150 km/h for 5 hours with a maximum gust of 210 km/h. <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>There was some minor damage in <a href="Karratha,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Karratha</a>. High winds and flooding caused extensive structural damage at many stations in the Pilbara and mining operations were suspended at many sites. The 113-year old Whim Creek Hotel suffered major damage with the top floor lost, and the town of <a href="Newman,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Newman</a> experienced some flooding (500 mm of rain was recorded). However, major towns in the Pilbara escaped any serious damage, and the damage was relatively light due to the sparseness of population in the area John hit. There were no deaths from John. <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Ten hours prior to landfall on the Australian coastline, John was moving southwards directly towards <a href="Karratha,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Karratha</a> and <a href="Dampier,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Dampier</a>. Had John failed to turn to the south-east like what it did, damage to the towns of Karratha, Dampier, Roebourne and Wickham caused by John would have been much worse. <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="severe-tropical-cyclone-kirrily">Severe Tropical Cyclone Kirrily</h3>

<p>Tropical Cyclone Kirrily formed about 350 kilometres east of the <a href="Cocos_Islands" title="wikilink">Cocos Islands</a> on <a href="January_24" title="wikilink">January 24</a>, <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a> and moved west southwest towards the <a href="Western_Australian" title="wikilink">Western Australian</a> coast. Kirrily intensified, reaching <a href="Category_2" title="wikilink">Category 2</a> status on <a href="January_27" title="wikilink">January 27</a>. On <a href="January_28" title="wikilink">January 28</a>, Kirrily turned southwest, moving away from the coast, weakening to below cyclone strength by <a href="January_31" title="wikilink">January 31</a>, while located approximately 900 km west of <a href="Carnarvon,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Carnarvon</a>. The lowest central pressure was estimated to have reached 970 hPa. <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> </p>

<p>A long lived cyclone lasting 13 days, Steve actually made landfall on various parts of Australia four times. It formed on <a href="February_27" title="wikilink">February 27</a>, <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a> and crossed the <a href="Queensland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queensland</a> coast north of <a href="Cairns,_Queensland" title="wikilink">Cairns</a> the same day as a strong Category 2 in the Australian Scale. It weakened to a low and then redeveloped in the <a href="Gulf_of_Carpentaria" title="wikilink">Gulf of Carpentaria</a>. Steve then crossed into the <a href="Northern_Territory" title="wikilink">Northern Territory</a> and weakened again. The low then moved over the <a href="Indian_Ocean" title="wikilink">Indian Ocean</a> near <a href="Broome,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Broome</a> and reformed again into a tropical cyclone. It intensified into a strong Category 2, reaching its peak intensity, and made landfall to the west of <a href="Karratha,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Karratha</a>. It weakened to a Category 1 and emerged again over the <a href="Indian_Ocean" title="wikilink">Indian Ocean</a> near <a href="Carnarvon,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Carnarvon</a>. It finally made its fourth landfall as a weak Category 1 on <a href="March_9" title="wikilink">March 9</a>, <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a> near <a href="Shark_Bay,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Shark Bay</a>. It accelerated to the south-east towards <a href="Esperance,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Esperance</a> and emerged over the <a href="Great_Australian_Bight" title="wikilink">Great Australian Bight</a> where it became extratropical. <a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

Most of the damage was caused by severe flooding which resulted with costs in excess of $100 million (AUD). There were no reports of deaths from Cyclone Steve. <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="tropical-cyclone-tessi">Tropical Cyclone Tessi</h3>

<p>A tropical low in the northern Coral Sea moved toward the coast, deepened into Tropical Cyclone Tessi on <a href="2_April" title="wikilink">2 April</a> and crossed the coast near Bambaroo and Crystal Creek (80km north of <a href="Townsville,_Queensland" title="wikilink">Townsville</a>) early on <a href="3_April" title="wikilink">3 April</a> as a Category 2 system on landfall.</p>
<p>Tessi's winds unroofed buildings, uprooted trees, downed power lines in the area between Ingham and Ayr. The Strand suffered wave damage with several boats destroyed. Heavy rain caused landslides on Townsville's Castle Hill destroying two homes and requiring the evacuation of another fifty homes. Considerable damage to personal property and to Townsville City infrastructure was reported. Townsville Aero reported a record April wind gust of 130km/h, a record April daily rainfall total of 271.6mm and the cyclone was the main contribution to a record April monthly total of 546.2mm.</p>
<p>Minor to moderate flooding in the Haughton River increased to major in the lower reaches with the highest level since the start of records in 1978 being recorded at Giru. <a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="tropical-cyclone-vaughan">Tropical Cyclone Vaughan</h3>

<p>A tropical low was first identified near <a href="New_Caledonia" title="wikilink">New Caledonia</a> on the <a href="29_March" title="wikilink">29 March</a>. The low tracked northwest through the <a href="Coral_Sea" title="wikilink">Coral Sea</a> to become Tropical Cyclone Vaughan early on the <a href="4_April" title="wikilink">4 April</a>. The system rapidly intensified to Category 2 during the morning of the 4th and tracked westward toward the north <a href="Queensland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queensland</a> tropical coast. TC Vaughan weakened a little during the <a href="5_April" title="wikilink">5 April</a> and was downgraded to a Category 1 system before re-intensifying to Category 2 early on the <a href="6_April" title="wikilink">6 April</a>. However by late morning on the 6th the system again rapidly weakened and was downgraded below cyclone strength during the afternoon. The remnants of TC Vaughan drifted slowly northwest and dissipated during the 7th April. There was no evidence of any significant impact on the coast from TC Vaughan. <a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> </p>

<h3 id="tropical-cyclone-iris">Tropical Cyclone Iris</h3>

<p>A disturbance was identified on <a href="3_January" title="wikilink">3 January</a> at 0600 (UTC) near Espiritu Santo in <a href="Vanuatu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vanuatu</a>. The storm was difficult to locate the general centre for the next couple of days, but on <a href="6_January" title="wikilink">6 January</a>, it became more organised, while displaying midget characteristics. On <a href="7_January" title="wikilink">7 January</a> at 2100 (UTC), it was named Tropical Cyclone Iris, located 180 nm northwest of <a href="Port_Vila" title="wikilink">Port Vila</a>, moving southeast. In Vila, 60 nm away from Iris's centre, recorded winds of only up to 20 kts, explaining the very small size of the cyclone. Iris intensified with 10-min winds increasing to 60 kts on <a href="8_January" title="wikilink">8 January</a> at 1200 (UTC). JTWC's estimated 1-min winds was 65 kts. There were some indications that Iris could be far more intense than what the warning centres estimated, mainly due to its small size. Iris accelerated eastward, leaving Vanuatu. On <a href="9_January" title="wikilink">9 January</a>, Iris began its weakening trend, while moving closer to <a href="Fiji" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fiji</a>. Iris was downgraded to a depression on <a href="10_January" title="wikilink">10 January</a>, just 48 hours after it had reached its peak intensity. The final warning placed the centre on the Dateline 150 nm southeast of Fiji.</p>
<p>Fresh to strong winds and very rough seas were experienced over the western and southern parts of Fiji. Overall damage was minimal. Cyclone Iris was most notable for its rapid strengthening in its early stages, followed by its rapid decay. <a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> </p>
