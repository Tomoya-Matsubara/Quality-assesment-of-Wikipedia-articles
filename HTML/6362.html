<p>In 1497&lt;U+2013&gt;1498, shortly after the <a href="Fall_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">Fall of Constantinople</a> and during the reign of Sultan <a href="Beyazid_II" title="wikilink">Beyazid II</a> (1481&lt;U+2013&gt;1512), the south church was converted into a <em>mescit</em> (a small mosque) by the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman</a> dignitary Fenarizade Al&lt;U+00E2&gt;eddin Ali ben Yusuf Effendi, <em><a href="Qadi_&#39;asker" title="wikilink">Qadi 'asker</a></em><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> of <a href="Rumeli" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rumeli</a>, and nephew of <a href="Molla_&lt;U+015E&gt;emseddin_Fenari" title="wikilink">Molla &lt;U+015E&gt;emseddin Fenari</a>,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> whose family belonged to the religious class of the <a href="ulema" class="uri" title="wikilink">ulema</a>. He built a <a href="minaret" class="uri" title="wikilink">minaret</a> in the southeast angle, and a <a href="mihrab" class="uri" title="wikilink">mihrab</a> in the <a href="apse" class="uri" title="wikilink">apse</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Since one of the head preachers of the <a href="madrasah" class="uri" title="wikilink">madrasah</a> was named <em>&lt;U+00CE&gt;s&lt;U+00E2&gt;</em> (&quot;Jesus&quot; in <a href="Arabic_language" title="wikilink">Arabic</a> and <a href="Turkish_language" title="wikilink">Turkish</a>), his name was added to that of the mosque. The edifice burned down in 1633, was restored in 1636 by <a href="Grand_Vizier" title="wikilink">Grand Vizier</a> <a href="Bayram_Pasha" title="wikilink">Bayram Pasha</a>, who upgraded the building to <em>cami</em> (&quot;mosque&quot;) and converted the north church into a <a href="Khanqah" title="wikilink">tekke</a> (a <a href="dervish" class="uri" title="wikilink">dervish</a> lodge). In this occasion the columns of the north church were substituted with <a href="Pier_(architecture)" title="wikilink">piers</a>, the two domes were renovated, and the mosaic decoration was removed.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> After another fire in 1782,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> the complex was restored again in 1847/48.

<h3 id="north-church">North church</h3>
<p>The <em>north church</em> has an unusual <a href="quincuncial" class="uri" title="wikilink">quincuncial</a> (<a href="cross-in-square" class="uri" title="wikilink">cross-in-square</a>) plan, and was one of the first shrines in Constantinople to adopt this plan, whose prototype is possibly the <em><a href="Nea_Ekklesia" title="wikilink">Nea Ekklesia</a></em> (&quot;New Church&quot;), erected in Constantinople in the year 880, of which no remains are extant.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Anyway, during the ottoman period the four columns have been replaced with two <a href="pointed_arch" title="wikilink">pointed arches</a> which span the whole church. <a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>The dimensions of the north church are small: the <em><a href="Cella" title="wikilink">naos</a></em> is 13 meters long and 9.5 meters wide, and was sized according to the population living in the monastery at that time. The <a href="masonry" class="uri" title="wikilink">masonry</a> of the northern church was erected by alternating courses of bricks and small rough stone blocks. In this technique, which is typical of the Byzantine architecture of the 10th century,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> the bricks sink in a thick bed of <a href="Mortar_(masonry)" title="wikilink">mortar</a>. The building is topped by an ottoman dome pierced by eight windows. <a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>This edifice has three high <a href="apse" title="wikilink">apses</a>: the central one is polygonal, and is flanked by the other two, which served as <em>pastophoria</em>:<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> <em><a href="prothesis_(altar)" title="wikilink">prothesis</a></em> and <em><a href="diaconicon" title="wikilink">diakonikon</a></em>.</p>
<p>The apses are interrupted by triple (by the central one)and single <a href="lancet_window" title="wikilink">lancet windows</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The walls of the central arms of the <em>naos</em> cross have two orders of windows: the lower order has triple lancet windows, the higher semicircular windows. Two long <em>parekklesia</em>, each one ended by a low apse, flanks the <em>presbytery</em> of the <em>naos</em>. The angular and central bays are very slender. At the four edges of the building are four small roof chapels, each surmounted by a <a href="cupola" class="uri" title="wikilink">cupola</a>.</p>
<p>The remainders of the original decoration of this church are the bases of three of the four columns of the central bay, and many original decorating elements, which survive on the pillars of the windows and on the frame of the dome. The decoration consisted originally in marble panels and coloured tiles: the vaults were decorated with <a href="Mosaic#Byzantine_mosaics" title="wikilink">mosaic</a>. Only spurs of it are now visible.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>As a whole, the north church presents strong analogies with the <a href="Bodrum_Mosque" title="wikilink">Bodrum Mosque</a> (the church of <em>Myrelaion</em>).<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="south-church">South church</h3>
<p>The <em>south church</em> is a square room surmounted by a dome, and surrounded by two <em>deambulatoria</em>,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> an <em>esonarthex</em> and a <em>parekklesion</em> (added later). The north deambulatorium is the south parekklesion of the north church. This multiplication of spaces around the central part of the church is typical of the late Palaiologian architecture: the reason of that was the need for more space for tombs, monuments erected to benefactors of the church, etc.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The central room is divided from the aisles by a triple arcade. During the mass the believers were confined in the deambulatoria, which were shallow and dark, and could barely see what happened in the central part of the church.</p>

</figure>
<p>The masonry is composed of alternated courses of bricks and stone, typical of the late Byzantine architecture in Constantinople.</p>
<p>The lush decoration of the south and of the main apses (the latter is heptagonal), is made of a triple order of <a href="Niche_(architecture)" title="wikilink">niches</a>, the middle order being alternated with triple windows. The bricks are arranged to form patterns like arches, hooks, <a href="Meander_(art)" title="wikilink">Greek frets</a>, <a href="sun_cross" title="wikilink">sun crosses</a>, <a href="swastika" title="wikilink">swastikas</a> and fans.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Between these patterns are white and dark red bands, alternating one course of stone with two to five of bricks. This is the first appearance of this most important decorating aspect of the Palaiologian architecture in Constantinople.</p>
<p>The church has an exonarthex surmounted by a gallery, which was extended to reach also the north church. The <em>parekklesion</em> was erected alongside the southern side of the south church, and was connected with the esonarthex, so that the room surrounds the whole complex on the west and south side. Several marble <a href="sarcophagus" title="wikilink">sarcophagi</a> are placed within it.</p>
<p>As a whole, this complex represents a notable example of the middle and late <a href="Byzantine_Architecture" title="wikilink">Byzantine Architecture</a> in Istanbul.</p>
