<p>ET}}    <strong><em>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</em></strong> (often referred to simply as <strong><em>E.T.</em></strong>) is a 1982 American <a href="science_fiction_film" title="wikilink">science fiction film</a> co-produced and directed by <a href="Steven_Spielberg" title="wikilink">Steven Spielberg</a>, written by <a href="Melissa_Mathison" title="wikilink">Melissa Mathison</a> and starring <a href="Henry_Thomas" title="wikilink">Henry Thomas</a>, <a href="Dee_Wallace" title="wikilink">Dee Wallace</a>, <a href="Robert_MacNaughton" title="wikilink">Robert MacNaughton</a>, <a href="Drew_Barrymore" title="wikilink">Drew Barrymore</a>, and <a href="Peter_Coyote" title="wikilink">Peter Coyote</a>. It tells the story of Elliott (played by Thomas), a lonely boy who befriends an <a href="Extraterrestrial_life" title="wikilink">extraterrestrial</a>, dubbed &quot;E.T.&quot;, who is stranded on Earth. Elliott and his siblings help the extraterrestrial return home while attempting to keep it hidden from their mother and the government.</p>
<p>The concept for <em>E.T.</em> was based on an imaginary friend Spielberg created after his parents' divorce in 1960. In 1980, Spielberg met Mathison and developed a new story from the stalled science fiction/horror film project <em><a href="Night_Skies" title="wikilink">Night Skies</a></em>. The film was shot from September to December 1981 in <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> on a budget of US$10.5 million. Unlike most motion pictures, the film was shot in roughly chronological order, to facilitate convincing emotional performances from the young cast.</p>
<p>Released by <a href="Universal_Pictures" title="wikilink">Universal Pictures</a>, <em>E.T.</em> was a <a href="Blockbuster_(entertainment)" title="wikilink">blockbuster</a>, surpassing <em><a href="Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope" title="wikilink">Star Wars</a></em> to become the highest-grossing film of all time&lt;U+2014&gt;a record it held for ten years until <em><a href="Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="wikilink">Jurassic Park</a></em>, another Spielberg-directed film, surpassed it in 1993. Critics acclaimed it as a timeless story of friendship, and it ranks as the <a href="Films_considered_the_greatest_ever#Particular_genres_or_media" title="wikilink">greatest science fiction film ever made</a> in a <a href="Rotten_Tomatoes" title="wikilink">Rotten Tomatoes</a> survey. The film was re-released in 1985, and then again in 2002 to celebrate the film's 20th anniversary, with altered shots and additional scenes.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>The film opens in a California forest as a group of <a href="Extraterrestrials_in_fiction" title="wikilink">alien</a> botanists collect <a href="flora" class="uri" title="wikilink">flora</a> samples. U.S. government agents appear on the scene, and the aliens flee in their spaceship, mistakenly leaving one of their own behind. The scene shifts to a suburban home, where a 10-year-old boy named Elliott is trying to hang out with his 16-year-old brother Michael and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, Elliott discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The creature promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott lures the alien from the forest to his bedroom using a trail of <a href="Reese&#39;s_Pieces" title="wikilink">Reese's Pieces</a> candy. Before he goes to sleep, Elliott realizes the alien is imitating his movements.</p>
<p>Elliott feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with the alien. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister Gertie meet the alien. They decide to keep him hidden from their mother. When they ask it about its origin, the alien levitates several balls to represent its solar system and then demonstrates its powers by reviving a dead flower plant.</p>
<p>At school the next day, Elliott begins to experience a psychic connection with the alien, including exhibiting signs of intoxication due to the alien drinking beer, and he begins freeing all the frogs in a biology class. As the alien watches <a href="John_Wayne" title="wikilink">John Wayne</a> kiss <a href="Maureen_O&#39;Hara" title="wikilink">Maureen O'Hara</a> in <em><a href="The_Quiet_Man" title="wikilink">The Quiet Man</a></em>, Elliott kisses a girl he likes.</p>

<p>The alien learns to speak English by repeating what Gertie says as she watches <em><a href="Sesame_Street" title="wikilink">Sesame Street</a></em> and, at Elliott's urging, dubs itself &quot;E.T.&quot; E.T. reads a comic strip where <a href="Buck_Rogers" title="wikilink">Buck Rogers</a>, stranded, calls for help by building a makeshift communication device, and is inspired to try it himself. He gets Elliott's help in building a device to &quot;phone home&quot; by using a <a href="Speak_&amp;_Spell_(toy)" title="wikilink">Speak &amp; Spell</a> toy. Michael notices that E.T.'s health is declining and that Elliott is referring to himself as &quot;we&quot;.</p>
<p>On Halloween, Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as a ghost so they can sneak him out of the house. Elliott and E.T. ride a bicycle to the forest, where E.T. makes a successful call home. The next morning, Elliott wakes up in the field, only to find E.T. gone, so he returns home to his distressed family. Michael searches for and finds E.T. dying in a ditch and takes him to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son's illness and the dying alien, just as government agents invade the house.</p>
<p>Scientists set up a medical facility there, quarantining Elliott and E.T. Their link disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliott recovers. A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless alien when he notices a dead flower, the plant E.T. had previously revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycle. Suddenly facing a dead end, they escape as E.T. uses <a href="Psychokinesis" title="wikilink">telekinesis</a> to lift them into the air and toward the forest.</p>
<p>Standing near the spaceship, E.T.'s heart glows as he prepares to return home. Mary, Gertie, and &quot;Keys&quot;, a government agent, show up. E.T. says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, as Gertie presents E.T. with the flower that he had revived. Before entering the spaceship, E.T. tells Elliott &quot;I'll be right here&quot;, pointing his glowing finger to Elliott's forehead. He then picks up the flower Gertie gave him, walks into the spaceship, and takes off, leaving a rainbow in the sky as Elliott (and the rest of them) watches the ship leave.</p>

<p>The major voice work for E.T. was performed by <a href="Pat_Welsh_(actress)" title="wikilink">Pat Welsh</a>, an elderly woman who lived in <a href="Marin_County,_California" title="wikilink">Marin County, California</a>. Welsh smoked two packets of cigarettes a day, which gave her voice a quality that sound effects creator <a href="Ben_Burtt" title="wikilink">Ben Burtt</a> liked. She spent nine-and-a-half hours recording her part, and was paid $380 by Burtt for her services.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Burtt also recorded 16 other people and various animals to create E.T.'s &quot;voice&quot;.

The scene featured Ford's character reprimanding Elliott for his behavior in science class and warning of the dangers of underage drinking; he is then taken aback as Elliott's chair rises from the floor, while E.T. is levitating his &quot;phone&quot; equipment up the staircase with Gertie.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>After his parents' divorce in 1960, Spielberg filled the void with an imaginary alien companion. Spielberg said that E.T. was &quot;a friend who could be the brother I never had and a father that I didn't feel I had anymore.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> During 1978, Spielberg announced he would shoot a film entitled <em>Growing Up</em>, which he would film in 28 days. The project was set aside because of delays on <em><a href="1941_(film)" title="wikilink">1941</a></em>, but the concept of making a small autobiographical film about childhood would stay with Spielberg.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He also thought about a follow-up to <em><a href="Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind" title="wikilink">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></em>, and began to develop a darker project he had planned with <a href="John_Sayles" title="wikilink">John Sayles</a> called <em><a href="Night_Skies" title="wikilink">Night Skies</a></em> in which malevolent aliens terrorize a family.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Filming <em><a href="Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark" title="wikilink">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></em> in <a href="Tunisia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tunisia</a> left Spielberg bored, and memories of his childhood creation resurfaced.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> He told screenwriter <a href="Melissa_Mathison" title="wikilink">Melissa Mathison</a> about <em>Night Skies</em>, and developed a subplot from the failed project, in which Buddy, the only friendly alien, befriends an <a href="autism" title="wikilink">autistic</a> child. Buddy's abandonment on Earth in the script's final scene inspired the <em>E.T.</em> concept.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Mathison wrote a first draft titled <em>E.T. and Me</em> in eight weeks,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> which Spielberg considered perfect.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The script went through two more drafts, which deleted an &quot;<a href="Eddie_Haskell" title="wikilink">Eddie Haskell</a>&quot;-esque friend of Elliott. The chase sequence was also created, and Spielberg also suggested having the scene where E.T. got drunk.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> <a href="Columbia_Pictures" title="wikilink">Columbia Pictures</a>, which had been producing <em>Night Skies</em>, met Spielberg to discuss the script.

DeMeritt actually walked on his hands and played all scenes where E.T. walked awkwardly or fell over. The head of the E.T. puppet was placed above the head of the actors, and the actors could see through slits in the puppet's chest.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Caprice Roth, a professional mime, filled prosthetics to play E.T.'s hands.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The puppet was created in three months at the cost of $1.5 million.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Spielberg declared it was &quot;something that only a mother could love.&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> <a href="Mars,_Incorporated" title="wikilink">Mars, Incorporated</a> found E.T. so ugly that the company refused to allow <a href="M&amp;M&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">M&amp;M's</a> to be used in the film, believing the creature would frighten children.

<h3 id="filming">Filming</h3>
<p><em>E.T.</em> began shooting in September 1981.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The project was filmed under the cover name <em>A Boy's Life</em>, as Spielberg did not want anyone to discover and plagiarize the plot. The actors had to read the script behind closed doors, and everyone on set had to wear an ID card.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The shoot began with two days at a high school in <a href="Culver_City,_California" title="wikilink">Culver City</a>, and the crew spent the next 11 days moving between locations at <a href="Northridge,_Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Northridge</a> and <a href="Sunland-Tujunga,_Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Tujunga</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The next 42 days were spent at Culver City's <a href="Culver_Studios" title="wikilink">Laird International Studios</a>, for the interiors of Elliott's home. The crew shot at a redwood forest near <a href="Crescent_City,_California" title="wikilink">Crescent City</a> for the production's last six days.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Spielberg shot the film in roughly chronological order to achieve convincingly emotional performances from his cast. In the scene in which Michael first encounters the alien, the creature's appearance caused MacNaughton to jump back and knock down the shelves behind him. The chronological shoot gave the young actors an emotional experience as they bonded with E.T., making the hospital sequences more moving.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Spielberg ensured the puppeteers kept away from the set to maintain the illusion of a real alien. For the first time in his career, he did not <a href="storyboard" class="uri" title="wikilink">storyboard</a> most of the film, in order to facilitate spontaneity in the performances.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The film was shot so adults, except for Dee Wallace, are never seen from the waist up in the film's first half, as a tribute to <a href="Tex_Avery" title="wikilink">Tex Avery</a>'s cartoons.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The shoot was completed in 61 days, four days ahead of schedule.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> According to Spielberg, the memorable scene where E.T. disguises himself as a stuffed animal in Elliott's closet was suggested by colleague <a href="Robert_Zemeckis" title="wikilink">Robert Zemeckis</a>, after he read a draft of the screenplay that Spielberg had sent him.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Longtime Spielberg collaborator <a href="John_Williams" title="wikilink">John Williams</a>, who composed the film's musical score, described the challenge of creating a score that would generate sympathy for such an odd-looking creature. As with their previous collaborations, Spielberg liked every theme Williams composed and had it included. Spielberg loved the music for the final chase so much that he edited the sequence to suit it.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Williams took a modernist approach, especially with his use of <a href="polytonality" class="uri" title="wikilink">polytonality</a>, which refers to the sound of two different keys played simultaneously. The <a href="Lydian_mode" title="wikilink">Lydian mode</a> can also be used in a polytonal way. Williams combined polytonality and the Lydian mode to express a mystic, dreamlike and heroic quality. His theme&lt;U+2014&gt;emphasizing coloristic instruments such as the harp, piano, celesta, and other keyboards, as well as percussion&lt;U+2014&gt;suggests E.T.'s childlike nature and his &quot;machine.&quot;<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="allegations-of-plagiarism">Allegations of plagiarism</h3>
<p>There were allegations that the film was plagiarized from a 1967 script, <em><a href="The_Alien_(film)" title="wikilink">The Alien</a></em>, by <a href="India" title="wikilink">Indian</a> <a href="Cinema_of_Bengal" title="wikilink">Bengali</a> director <a href="Satyajit_Ray" title="wikilink">Satyajit Ray</a>.
