<h3 id="u201392-television-and-film-debut">1988&lt;U+2013&gt;92: Television and film debut</h3>
<p>Khan's first starring role was in <a href="Lekh_Tandon" title="wikilink">Lekh Tandon</a>'s television series <em>Dil Dariya</em>, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the 1989 series <em><a href="Fauji_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Fauji</a></em> becoming his television debut instead. In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> This led to further appearances in <a href="Aziz_Mirza" title="wikilink">Aziz Mirza</a>'s television series <em><a href="Circus_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Circus</a></em> (1989&lt;U+2013&gt;90) and <a href="Mani_Kaul" title="wikilink">Mani Kaul</a>'s miniseries <em><a href="Idiot_(1992_film)" title="wikilink">Idiot</a></em> (1991). Khan also played minor parts in the serials <em>Umeed</em> (1989) and <em><a href="Wagle_Ki_Duniya" title="wikilink">Wagle Ki Duniya</a></em> (1988&lt;U+2013&gt;90), and in the English-language <a href="television_film" title="wikilink">television film</a> <em><a href="In_Which_Annie_Gives_It_Those_Ones" title="wikilink">In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones</a></em> (1989).<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor <a href="Dilip_Kumar" title="wikilink">Dilip Kumar</a>, but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Khan changed his decision to act in films in April 1991, citing it as a way to escape the grief of his mother's death.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He moved from Delhi to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career in Bollywood, and was quickly signed to four films. His first offer was for <a href="Hema_Malini" title="wikilink">Hema Malini</a>'s directorial debut <em><a href="Dil_Aashna_Hai" title="wikilink">Dil Aashna Hai</a></em>,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and by June, he had started his first shoot.

According to Arnab Ray of <em><a href="Daily_News_and_Analysis" title="wikilink">Daily News and Analysis</a></em>, Khan brought a new kind of acting as he was &quot;sliding down stairs on a slab of ice, cartwheeling, somersaulting, lips trembling, eyes trembling, bringing to the screen the kind of physical energy ... visceral, intense, maniacal one moment and cloyingly boyish the next.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="u201394-anti-hero">1993&lt;U+2013&gt;94: Anti-hero</h3>
<p>Among his 1993 releases, Khan garnered the most appreciation for portraying villainous roles in two box office hits: an obsessive lover in <em><a href="Darr" class="uri" title="wikilink">Darr</a></em>, and a murderer in <em><a href="Baazigar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baazigar</a></em>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> <em>Darr</em> marked the first of Khan's many collaborations with filmmaker <a href="Yash_Chopra" title="wikilink">Yash Chopra</a> and his company <a href="Yash_Raj_Films" title="wikilink">Yash Raj Films</a>. Khan's stammering and the use of the phrase &quot;I love you, K-k-k-Kiran&quot; were popular with audiences.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> For <em>Darr</em> he received a nomination for the <a href="Filmfare_Award_for_Best_Performance_in_a_Negative_Role" title="wikilink">Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role</a>, also known as the Best Villain Award, but lost to <a href="Paresh_Rawal" title="wikilink">Paresh Rawal</a> for <em><a href="Sir_(film)" title="wikilink">Sir</a></em>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> <em>Baazigar</em>, in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In <em>The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture</em>, Sonal Khullar called the character &quot;the consummate anti-hero&quot;. His performance in <em>Baazigar</em>, which would be his first of many appearances with actress <a href="Kajol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kajol</a>, won Khan his first <a href="Filmfare_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="wikilink">Filmfare Award for Best Actor</a>. In 2003, the <em>Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema</em> stated that Khan &quot;defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero&quot;. Also in 1993, Khan performed a nude scene with <a href="Deepa_Sahi" title="wikilink">Deepa Sahi</a> in <em><a href="Maya_Memsaab" title="wikilink">Maya Memsaab</a></em>, although parts of it were censored by the <a href="Central_Board_of_Film_Certification" title="wikilink">Central Board of Film Certification</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The ensuing controversy prompted him to eschew such scenes in future roles.</p>
<p>In 1994, Khan played a love-struck musician in <a href="Kundan_Shah" title="wikilink">Kundan Shah</a>'s comedy-drama film <em><a href="Kabhi_Haan_Kabhi_Naa" title="wikilink">Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa</a></em>, which he later professed was his favourite role.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> His performance earned him a <a href="Filmfare_Critics_Award_for_Best_Performance" title="wikilink">Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance</a>, and in a retrospective review from 2004, Sukanya Verma of <a href="Rediff.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rediff.com</a> referred to it as Khan's best performance, saying &quot;He is spontaneous, vulnerable, boyish, mischievous and acting straight from the heart.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Also in 1994, Khan won the Filmfare Best Villain Award for his role as an obsessive lover in <em><a href="Anjaam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anjaam</a></em>, co-starring <a href="Madhuri_Dixit" title="wikilink">Madhuri Dixit</a>. At the time, playing antagonistic roles was considered risky to a leading man's career in Bollywood. Ray subsequently credited Khan for taking &quot;insane risks&quot; and &quot;pushing the envelope&quot; by choosing to play such characters, through which he established his career in Bollywood.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The director <a href="Mukul_S._Anand" title="wikilink">Mukul S.
