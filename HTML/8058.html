While the Simpsons are at a movie, there is a parody of the <a href="THX" class="uri" title="wikilink">THX</a> sound <a href="Deep_Note" title="wikilink">Deep Note</a>. The THX executives liked the parody so much that the scene was made into an actual THX movie trailer, with the scene being redone for the <a href="widescreen" class="uri" title="wikilink">widescreen</a> aspect ratio. A deleted scene from the episode sees Mr. Burns release a &quot;Robotic <a href="Richard_Simmons" title="wikilink">Richard Simmons</a>&quot; as a way of getting rid of Homer.

Angry and humiliated after the audition ends, only made worse by Burns kicking him up the &quot;<a href="Anus" title="wikilink">butt</a>&quot; with a mechanical boot, which makes Homer burst into hysterics, Bart vandalizes Mr. Burns's house. Mr. Burns approves of Bart's <a href="malevolence" class="uri" title="wikilink">malevolence</a> and decides to accept him as his heir.</p>
<p><a href="Homer_Simpson" title="wikilink">Homer</a> and <a href="Marge_Simpson" title="wikilink">Marge</a> sign a legal document which officially names Bart as Mr. Burns' heir. Marge suggests that Bart should spend some time with Mr. Burns. While initially repelled by Mr. Burns' coldness, Bart begins to take a liking to him after Burns promises to give Bart whatever he wants out of life. Bart decides to abandon his family because Mr. Burns allows him to do anything he likes. His family becomes angry and wants Bart back, so they decide to sue Mr. Burns, but the case does not turn out in their favor. The Simpsons get a deprogrammer to kidnap Bart, but the deprogrammer takes <a href="Hans_Moleman" title="wikilink">Hans Moleman</a> instead and brainwashes him into thinking he's a part of the Simpson family.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bart becomes lonely and wants to go back to his family. Mr. Burns does not want him to leave and tricks him into thinking that his family hates him, using a falsified video with actors playing the Simpson family. Bart decides that Burns is his true father and the two celebrate by firing employees at the <a href="Springfield_Nuclear_Power_Plant" title="wikilink">Springfield Nuclear Power Plant</a>. However, one of the employees is Homer and Mr. Burns then tries to break Bart's ties with his family by forcing him to fire Homer. Bart instead &quot;fires&quot; Burns and drops him through a trap door. He decides that he loves his family, and moves back in with them.</p>
