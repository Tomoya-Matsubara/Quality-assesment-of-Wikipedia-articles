<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Rock On Ruby is a bay horse bred in Ireland by John O'Dwyer. He is one of many successful <a href="National_Hunt" title="wikilink">jumpers</a> sire by <a href="Oscar_(horse)" title="wikilink">Oscar</a> a son of <a href="Sadler&#39;s_Wells_(horse)" title="wikilink">Sadler's Wells</a> based at the Grange Stud in <a href="County_Cork" title="wikilink">County Cork</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> His dam Stony View never raced but has produced at least two other winners. Rock On Ruby was first offered for sale as a foal in November 2005 when he was bought for &lt;U+20AC&gt;23,000 by the Whitehorse Stud. As a four-year-old gelding, Rock On Ruby was sent to the Doncaster sales in May 2009 where he was bought for &lt;U+00A3&gt;23,000 by Richard Barber and entered the ownership of the Festival Goers syndicate.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Although the horse is officially trained by <a href="Paul_Nicholls_(horse_racing)" title="wikilink">Paul Nicholls</a> at <a href="Ditcheat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ditcheat</a> in <a href="Somerset" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somerset</a>, he is actually stabled twenty-five miles away in Nicholls' satellite yard at <a href="Seaborough" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seaborough</a> in <a href="Dorset" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dorset</a> where his day-to-day conditioning is handled by the assistant trainer Harry Fry.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="national-hunt-flat-races">2009–2010: National Hunt Flat races</h3>
<p>Rock On Ruby began his career by running in <a href="National_Hunt_flat_race" title="wikilink">National Hunt flat races</a>. On his first appearance in a minor event at Newbury in November 2009 he finished fourth to Oscar Whisky, a horse who went on to win the <a href="Aintree_Hurdle" title="wikilink">Aintree Hurdle</a> in 2011. Rock On Ruby recorded his first win on his next start at <a href="Taunton_Racecourse" title="wikilink">Taunton</a> in February beating Karasenir by three quarters of a length when ridden by his namesake <a href="Ruby_Walsh" title="wikilink">Ruby Walsh</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> On his only other start of the season he beat Karasenir again, this time carrying top weight of 163 <a href="Pound_(mass)" title="wikilink">pounds</a> in a similar event at Newbury in March.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="novice-hurdles">2010–2011: Novice hurdles</h3>
<p>Rock On Ruby began the 2010/2011 season by winning his third successive National Hunt flat race, this time at Cheltenham, and was then campaigned in Novice Hurdle races (races confined to horses which have not won over hurdles before the start of the season). He made a successful hurdling debut by winning a race at Newbury in December by six lengths: few details of his victory were reported as the race was run in thick fog.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The victory prompted some interest in Rock On Ruby as a prospect for one of the major Novice hurdle races at the <a href="Cheltenham_Festival" title="wikilink">Cheltenham Festival</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He was then moved up in class to contest the Grade II <a href="Classic_Novices&#39;_Hurdle" title="wikilink">Classic Novices' Hurdle</a> at Cheltenham in January. He jumped the last hurdle level with <a href="Bobs_Worth" title="wikilink">Bobs Worth</a> but was beaten by two and a half lengths after his jockey dropped his whip 120 <a href="yard" title="wikilink">yards</a> from the finish.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Rock On Ruby was then promoted to the highest level at the <a href="Cheltenham_Festival" title="wikilink">Cheltenham Festival</a> where he ran in the Grade I <a href="Neptune_Investment_Management_Novices&#39;_Hurdle" title="wikilink">Neptune Investment Management Novices' Hurdle</a> over two miles five <a href="furlong" title="wikilink">furlongs</a>. Ridden by Daryl Jacob he took the lead at the last hurdle and ran on strongly but was caught &quot;in the last stride&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and beaten a short head by First Lieutenant. On his final start of the season he finished third behind Spirit Son and Cue Card in the <a href="Mersey_Novices&#39;_Hurdle" title="wikilink">Mersey Novices' Hurdle</a> at <a href="Aintree_Racecourse" title="wikilink">Aintree</a> in April.</p>
<h3 id="senior-hurdles">2011–2012: Senior hurdles</h3>
<p>After being campaigned over longer distances as a novice, Rock On Ruby was brought back in distance on his first race of the 2011/2012 season. Running over two miles in the Gerry Feilden Hurdle, a <a href="handicap_race" title="wikilink">handicap race</a> at Newbury, he carried top weight of 164 pounds and won &quot;readily&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> by six lengths from his stable companion Empire Levant to whom he was conceding 24 pounds. Following this win he was strongly fancied for the Grade I <a href="Christmas_Hurdle" title="wikilink">Christmas Hurdle</a> at <a href="Kempton_Park_Racecourse" title="wikilink">Kempton Park</a> and started 7/4 second favourite behind the 2010 <a href="Champion_Hurdle" title="wikilink">Champion Hurdler</a> <a href="Binocular_(horse)" title="wikilink">Binocular</a>. Rock On Ruby took a slight lead at the second last hurdle and looked the likely winner<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> but after what the <em><a href="Racing_Post" title="wikilink">Racing Post</a></em> described as a &quot;thrilling battle&quot;,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> finished second to Binocular, beaten a neck at level weights.</p>
<p>In the 2012 Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham on 13 March, Rock On Ruby started 11/1 fourth choice in the betting, behind the reigning champion <a href="Hurricane_Fly" title="wikilink">Hurricane Fly</a>, Binocular and Zarkandar. From the start of the race Rock On Ruby, ridden by Noel Fehily tracked the leader Overturn and then moved up to dispute the lead two hurdles from the finish. He took a decisive advantage turning into the straight and ran on strongly under pressure, showing what the <em><a href="Daily_Telegraph" title="wikilink">Daily Telegraph</a></em> described as &quot;tremendous courage&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> to win going away by three and three quarter lengths from Overturn, Hurricane Fly and Binocular.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> After the race, Harry Fry said that &quot;We wanted to win. We didn't come here to finish second best. We were here to win and he's come and done it.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
