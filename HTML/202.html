<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Carey grew up in <a href="Butler,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Butler, Pennsylvania</a> as Josephine Vicari and would later change her name at the suggestion of her television station's general manager. Carey was the host of <a href="Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh</a>'s children show, <em>The Children's Corner</em> on <a href="WQED_(TV)" title="wikilink">WQED</a> from 1953 to 1961. Carey was one of the station's original employees, beginning work there in October 1953 — six months before WQED actually started broadcasting. She went door-to-door, raising money for the station selling $2 educational program guides.</p>
<p>Carey was partnered with <a href="Fred_Rogers" title="wikilink">Fred Rogers</a> (<a href="Mr._Rogers" title="wikilink">Mr. Rogers</a>) who would act as puppeteer of various puppets who would dance along to 68 songs which he wrote and for which Carey wrote the lyrics. Carey joined <a href="ASCAP" class="uri" title="wikilink">ASCAP</a> in 1955 and she and Rogers produced such songs as &quot;Goodnight God,&quot; &quot;It's Morning,&quot; and &quot;Why Hi, Don't I Know You?&quot; — the theme song for her program. Carey once remarked on their collaboration, &quot;He would make me very angry because I'd labor over my lyrics and he would sit at the piano and what took me four hours, he would do in four minutes.&quot;</p>
<p><em>The Children's Corner</em> was syndicated on <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a> for 39 weeks and won a Sylvania Award in 1955 for the best locally produced children's program in the country. <em>The Children's Corner</em> debuted puppet characters who would go on to future fame on &quot;<a href="Mister_Rogers&#39;_Neighborhood" title="wikilink">Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</a>&quot;—characters like <a href="King_Friday_XIII" title="wikilink">King Friday XIII</a> (who would dub four children &quot;Prince&quot; or &quot;Princess&quot; during the birthday greetings segment of the Children's Corner) and Daniel Striped Tiger, who was named after WQED's first general manager, Dorothy Daniel. The program also featured a wide range of human guests, including <a href="Johnny_Carson" title="wikilink">Johnny Carson</a>, <a href="Shirley_Jones" title="wikilink">Shirley Jones</a>, <a href="Van_Cliburn" title="wikilink">Van Cliburn</a>, and <a href="Charles_Schulz" title="wikilink">Charles Schulz</a>.</p>
<p>After her show was cancelled, Carey went on to host other children's programming, including <em>Josie's Storyland</em> and <em>Funsville</em>, which were aired on <a href="KDKA-TV" class="uri" title="wikilink">KDKA-TV</a> in Pittsburgh; <em>Wheee!</em> in <a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a> in the 1970s; and most recently, <em>Josie's Attic</em> during the 1990s on <a href="WQEX" class="uri" title="wikilink">WQEX</a> in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>In 2000 the <a href="Academy_of_Television_Arts_&amp;_Sciences" title="wikilink">Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences</a> Archive of American Television interviewed Carey to preserve in their archives in <a href="North_Hollywood" title="wikilink">North Hollywood</a> a record of her memories and experiences. She continued to perform, act, and direct in Pittsburgh <a href="community_theater" title="wikilink">community theater</a> up to her death, resulting from complications from a fall, at age 73.</p>
