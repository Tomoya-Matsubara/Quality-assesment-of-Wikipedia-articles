<p>Since the <a href="Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989" title="wikilink">Tiananmen Square protests of 1989</a>, the human rights issue of China has come to the forefront. Multiple sources, including the <a href="United_States_Department_of_State" title="wikilink">U.S. State Department's</a> annual <a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">People's Republic of China</a> human rights reports, as well as studies from other groups such as <a href="Amnesty_International" title="wikilink">Amnesty International</a> and <a href="Human_Rights_Watch" title="wikilink">Human Rights Watch</a>, have documented the PRC's abuses of <a href="human_rights" title="wikilink">human rights</a> in violation of internationally recognized norms.</p>
<p>The PRC government argues that the notion of human rights should include economic standards of living and measures of health and economic prosperity,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and notes progress in that area.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Controversial human rights issues in China include policies such as <a href="capital_punishment" title="wikilink">capital punishment</a>, the <a href="one-child_policy" title="wikilink">one-child policy</a>, the policy of <a href="Han_Chinese" title="wikilink">Han Chinese</a> cultural integration towards <a href="Tibet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tibet</a>, and lack of protections regarding freedom of press and religion.</p>
<p>A number of organizations work to create awareness and campaign for change with regard to human rights in China. These include <a href="Amnesty_International" title="wikilink">Amnesty International</a>, <a href="Human_Rights_Watch" title="wikilink">Human Rights Watch</a>, <a href="Human_Rights_in_China" title="wikilink">Human Rights in China</a>, <a href="Chinese_Human_Rights_Defenders" title="wikilink">Chinese Human Rights Defenders</a> (CHRD) and <a href="China_Human_Rights_Lawyers_Concern_Group" title="wikilink">China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group</a> (CHRWCG). <em>For more details, see <a href="China_Human_Rights_Organizations" title="wikilink">China Human Rights Organizations</a></em></p>
<h2 id="legal-system">Legal system</h2>
<p>The Chinese government recognizes that there are problems with the current legal system,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lack of laws in general, not just ones to protect civil rights.</li>
<li>A lack of <a href="due_process" title="wikilink">due process</a>.</li>
<li>Conflicts of law.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>As judges are appointed by the State and the judiciary as a whole does not have its own budget,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> this has led to corruption and the abuse of administrative power.</p>

<h3 id="freedom-of-speech">Freedom of speech</h3>

<p>Although the 1982 <a href="Constitution_of_the_People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">constitution</a> guarantees freedom of speech,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> the Chinese government often uses the <em>subversion of state power</em> clause to imprison those who are critical of the government.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Also, there is very heavy government involvement in the media,  Chinese law forbids the advocacy of <a href="independence" class="uri" title="wikilink">independence</a> or <a href="self-determination" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-determination</a> for territories Beijing considers under its jurisdiction, as well as public challenge to the CCP's monopoly in ruling China. Thus references to democracy, the Free Tibet movement, <a href="Taiwan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taiwan</a> as an independent state, certain religious organizations and anything remotely questioning the legitimacy of the Communist Party of China are banned from use in publications and <a href="Internet_censorship_in_the_People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">blocked on the Internet</a>. PRC journalist <a href="He_Qinglian" title="wikilink">He Qinglian</a> in her 2004 book <em>Media Control in China</em><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> examined government controls on the Internet in China<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and on all media. Her book shows how PRC media controls rely on confidential guidance from the Communist Party propaganda department, intense monitoring, and punishment for violators rather than on pre-publication censorship.</p>
<p>Foreign internet search engines including Microsoft Live Search, Yahoo!, <em>Google Search China</em><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> have come under criticism for aiding in these practices, including banning the word &quot;Democracy&quot; from its chat rooms in China. <a href="Criticism_of_Yahoo!#Work_in_the_People.27s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">Yahoo! in particular</a>, stated that it will not protect the privacy and confidentiality of its Chinese customers from the authorities,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and was criticised by <a href="Human_Rights_Watch" title="wikilink">Human Rights Watch</a> and <a href="Reporters_Without_Borders" title="wikilink">Reporters Without Borders</a> of having &quot;taken on the role of censor.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In October 2008, <a href="Citizen_Lab" title="wikilink">Citizen Lab</a> revealed that <a href="TOM_Online" title="wikilink">TOM Online</a>'s Chinese-language <a href="Skype" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skype</a> software filtered sensitive words and then logged these messages to a file on non-secure computer servers.

<p>In anticipation of the <a href="2008_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">2008 Summer Olympics</a>, China faced international criticism regarding its human rights record. China has acknowledged &quot;the need to keep advancing human rights,&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and resumed a human rights dialog with the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> A number of foreign protesters were deported from China during the Games.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Others were detained until the closing ceremony and then deported.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> An unauthorised protest by seven activists protesting about China's involvement in Tibet at the <a href="China_Nationalities_Museum" title="wikilink">Chinese Ethnic Culture Park</a>, blocking its entrance, was cleared away by the authorities.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>The Chinese government had promised to issue permits allowing people to protest in so-called 'protest parks' during the Games,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> but on 18 August it was reported that of 77 applications, 74 were withdrawn, two suspended and one vetoed.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Two elderly Chinese women were reported to have been sentenced to &quot;re-education through labour&quot; for having applied for a permit.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The Chinese authorities stated they had no record of the sentences.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Their sentence was suspended subject to proper behaviour, and to restrictions on movement.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Furthermore, many human rights lawyers and political dissidents were rounded up; the armies of migrant workers who built the Olympic stadiums have been encouraged to leave town, lest their dishevelled appearances detract from the image of a clean, modern nation.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>A Chinese lawyer explained, &quot;For Chinese petitioners, if their protest applications were approved, it would lead to a chain reaction of others seeking to voice their problems as well&quot; and an academic observed that: &quot;When you have guests coming over for dinner, you clean up the house and tell the children not to argue.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Critics also argue that the Chinese authorities failed to live up to their promises on press freedom. <a href="ITV_News" title="wikilink">ITV News</a> reporter John Ray was arrested while covering a pro-Tibet protest.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Foreign journalists also reported that their access to certain websites, including those of human rights organisations, was restricted.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> <a href="International_Olympic_Committee" title="wikilink">International Olympic Committee</a> president <a href="Jacques_Rogge" title="wikilink">Jacques Rogge</a> stated at the end of the Games that &quot;The regulations might not be perfect but they are a sea-change compared to the situation before.

<p>The <a href="Communist_Party_of_China" title="wikilink">Communist Party</a> came to power in the late 1940s and instigated a <a href="command_economy" title="wikilink">command economy</a>. In 1958, Mao set up a residency permit system defining where people could work, and classified an individual as a &quot;rural&quot; or &quot;urban&quot; worker.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> A worker seeking to move from the country to an urban area to take up non-agricultural work would have to apply through the relevant bureaucracies.  People who worked outside their authorized domain or geographical area would not qualify for grain rations, employer-provided housing, or health care.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> There were controls over education, employment, marriage and so on.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a>  As a part of the <a href="one_country,_two_systems" title="wikilink">one country, two systems</a> policy initiated by <a href="Deng_Xiaopeng" title="wikilink">Deng Xiaopeng</a>, Chinese citizens must gain permission from the government to travel to the <a href="Special_Administrative_Region_of_the_People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">special administrative regions</a> of Hong Kong and Macao.</p>
<p>Urban dwellers enjoy a range of social, economic and cultural benefits while peasants, the majority of the Chinese population, are treated as second-class citizens, according to an academic at the University of Alberta.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Washington_Times" title="wikilink">The Washington Times</a></em> reported in 2000 that although migrant labourers play an important part in spreading wealth in Chinese villages, they are treated &quot;like second-class citizens by a system so discriminatory that it has been likened to apartheid.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Anita Chan also posits that China's household registration and temporary residence permit system has created a situation analogous to the passbook system in South Africa which was designed to regulate the supply of cheap labor.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The Centre for Human Rights and Democracy has alleged that people of <a href="Han_Chinese" title="wikilink">Han descent</a> in Tibet have a far easier time acquiring the necessary permits to live in urban areas than ethnic Tibetans do.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Abolition of this policy was proposed in 11 provinces, mainly along the developed eastern coast. The law has already been changed such that migrant workers no longer face summary arrest, after a widely publicised incident in 2003, when a university-educated migrant died in Guangdong province. The Beijing law lecturer who exposed the incident said it spelt the end of the <a href="hukou_system" title="wikilink">hukou system</a>: in most smaller cities, the system has been abandoned; it has &quot;almost lost its function&quot; in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="treatment-of-rural-workers">Treatment of rural workers</h4>
<p>In November 2005 <a href="Jiang_Wenran" title="wikilink">Jiang Wenran</a>, acting director of the China Institute at the <a href="University_of_Alberta" title="wikilink">University of Alberta</a>, said this system was one of the most strictly enforced 'apartheid' structures in modern world history.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> He stated &quot;Urban dwellers enjoy a range of social, economic and cultural benefits while peasants, the majority of the Chinese population, are treated as second-class citizens&quot;.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>The discrimination enforced by the <em><a href="hukou_system" title="wikilink">hukou system</a></em> became particularly onerous in the 1980s after hundreds of millions of migrant laborers were forced out of state corporations and co-operatives.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The system classifies workers as &quot;urban&quot; or &quot;rural&quot;,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> and attempts by workers classified as &quot;rural&quot; to move to urban centers were tightly controlled by the Chinese bureaucracy, which enforced its control by denying access to essential goods and services such as grain rations, housing, and health care,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> and by regularly closing down migrant workers' private schools.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The <em>hukou</em> system also enforced <a href="pass_laws" title="wikilink">pass laws</a> similar to those in South Africa,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> with &quot;rural&quot; workers requiring six passes to work in provinces other than their own,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> and periodic police raids which rounded up those without permits, placed them in detention centers, and deported them.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> As in South Africa, the restrictions placed on the mobility of migrant workers were pervasive,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> and transient workers were forced to live a precarious existence in company dormitories or <a href="shanty_towns" title="wikilink">shanty towns</a>, and suffering abusive consequences.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Anita Chan furthers that China's household registration and temporary residence permit system has created a situation analogous to the passbook system in apartheid South Africa, which were designed to regulate the supply of cheap labor.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>David Whitehouse divides what he describes as &quot;Chinese apartheid&quot; into three distinct phases: The first phase occurred during the <a href="State_capitalism" title="wikilink">state capitalist</a> phase of China's economy, from around 1953 to the death of <a href="Mao_Zedong" title="wikilink">Mao Zedong</a> in 1976. The second &quot;<a href="Neoliberalism" title="wikilink">neoliberal</a>&quot; phase lasted from 1978 to 2001, and the third lasted from 2001 to the present. During the first phase, the exploitation of rural labor, the passbook system, and in particular the non-portable rights associated with one's status, created what Whitehouse calls &quot;an apartheid system&quot;. As with South Africa, the ruling party made some concessions to rural workers to make life in rural areas &quot;survivable... if not easy or pleasant&quot;. During the second phase, as China transitioned from state capitalism to market capitalism, export-processing zones were created in city suburbs, where mostly female migrants worked under oppressive <a href="sweatshop" class="uri" title="wikilink">sweatshop</a> conditions. The third phase was characterized by the weakening of the <em>hukou</em> controls; by 2004 the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture counted over 100 million people registered as &quot;rural&quot; working in cities.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Au Loong-yu, Nan Shan, and Zhang Ping of the Committee for Asian Women argue this system oppresses women more severely than men,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> and see seven distinct elements giving rise to what they describe as &quot;the regime of spatial and social apartheid&quot; which keeps rural Chinese in their subordinate status:</p>
<ol>
<li>The repressive regime at the factory level;</li>
<li>the paramilitary forces at local level;</li>
<li>the &lt;U+2018&gt;local protectionism&lt;U+2019&gt; of local governments;</li>
<li>the fiercely pro-business and pro-government attitude of the local press;</li>
<li>the fiercely pro-business and pro-government attitude of the branches of <a href="All-China_Federation_of_Trade_Unions" title="wikilink">ACFTU</a>;</li>
<li>pro-government local courts; and</li>
<li>the discriminatory <em>hukou</em> system.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></li>
</ol>
<p>They agree that the gradual relaxation of some of the more repressive aspects of the <em>hukou</em> system since the mid-1990s has largely eliminated the spatial aspect of the apartheid; for example, workers can now buy one year permits to reside in cities, and since 2003 the police no longer jail and deport people who lack local <em>hukou</em> passes. However, they point out the still-hereditary nature of the <em>hukou</em> system, and state that the &quot;substance of the social apartheid in general and the <em>hukou</em> system in particular remains intact.&quot; Migrant workers are permanently marked as outsiders and remain second-class citizens, and are denied access to good jobs or upward mobility, thus forcing their eventual return to their place of origin.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>Whitehouse sees the analogy to South Africa's apartheid system breaking down in two areas: First, under a system called <em>xia xiang</em>, or &quot;sending down&quot;, individuals or even entire factories of urban workers were sometimes re-classified as rural workers and sent to live in the countryside (at lower wages and benefits). By contrast, white workers in South Africa were never sent to work in <a href="Bantustans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bantustans</a>. Second, the ideology driving China's apartheid system was <a href="Maoism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maoism</a>, not <a href="racism" class="uri" title="wikilink">racism</a>, as is South African apartheid.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Anita Chan agrees with Whitehouse on this point, noting that while the <em>hukou</em> system shares many of the characteristics of the South African apartheid system, including its underlying economic logic, the racial element is not present.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Ministry_of_Public_Security_of_the_People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">Chinese Ministry of Public Security</a> justified these practices on the grounds that they assisted the police in tracking down criminals and maintaining public order, and provided demographic data for government planning and programs.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;Rural&quot; workers are required to have six passes to work in provinces other than their own.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Those without permits are rounded up by police, placed in detention centers, and deported.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Restrictions placed on the mobility of migrant workers were pervasive,<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> and some transient workers were forced to live a precarious existence in company dormitories or <a href="shanty_towns" title="wikilink">shanty towns</a>, and suffering abusive consequences.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The system, which has targeted China's 800 million rural peasants for decades, has been described by journalists Peter Alexander and Anita Chan as &quot;China's apartheid&quot;.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Peter Alexander and Anita Chan, China's export-oriented growth has been based on the labor of poorly paid and treated migrant workers, using a <a href="Pass_Law" title="wikilink">pass system</a> similar to the one used in South Africa's apartheid, in which massive abuses of human rights have been observed.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>An article in <a href="The_Washington_Times" title="wikilink">The Washington Times</a>, reported in 2000 that although migrant laborers play an important part in spreading wealth in Chinese villages, they are treated &quot;like second-class citizens by a system so discriminatory that it has been likened to apartheid.&quot;<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>The Chinese embassy in South Africa posted a letter to the editor of <a href="The_Star_(South_Africa)" title="wikilink">The Star</a> dated 22 February 2007 , under the title <em>Article on China presents racism rumours as fact</em>, in which a reader stated that &quot;It's pure incitement to proclaim 'Chinese apartheid' in reference to migrant labour being kept out of the cities.&quot;<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="religious-freedom">Religious freedom</h3>

<p>During the <a href="Cultural_Revolution" title="wikilink">Cultural Revolution</a> (1966-1976), particularly the <a href="Four_Olds" title="wikilink">Destruction of Four Olds</a> campaign, religious affairs of all types were persecuted and discouraged by the Communists with many religious buildings looted and destroyed. Since then, there have been efforts to repair, reconstruct and protect historical and cultural religious sites.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> The US department of state criticizes in its human rights report 2005 that not enough has been done to repair or restore damaged and destroyed sites.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1982 Constitution technically guarantees its citizens the right to believe in any religion.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> However this freedom differs from the general concept of &quot;<a href="freedom_of_religion" title="wikilink">freedom of religion</a>&quot; as recognised in the West, and is subject to restrictions.</p>
<p>Members of the Communist Party are officially required to be <a href="atheists" class="uri" title="wikilink">atheists</a>.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> While many party members privately violate this rule,<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> being openly religious can limit their economic prospects. </p>
<h4 id="christianity">Christianity</h4>
<p>The government tries to maintain tight control over all religions, so the only legal Christian groups (<a href="Three-Self_Patriotic_Movement" title="wikilink">Three-Self Patriotic Movement</a> and <a href="Chinese_Patriotic_Catholic_Association" title="wikilink">Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association</a>) are those under the <a href="Communist_Party_of_China" title="wikilink">Communist Party</a> control. </p>
<p>The &quot;official Catholic&quot; metropolitan bishop appointed in China in 2007 to replace the deceased Fu Tieshan was not made by the Pope as is customary.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> The <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Catholic Church</a> in particular is viewed as a foreign power in a situation somewhat analogous to that in Post-Reformation England, and so the official church in China is state-controlled; accordingly this overground Chinese church is considered a schismatic group by the wider Church; there exists also an illegal and underground &quot;real-Catholic&quot; community still loyal to the Pope and the wider Church.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> According to the <em><a href="Voice_of_the_Martyrs" title="wikilink">Voice of the Martyrs</a></em>, the growth of organised religious groups in China is tempered by state controls and regulations which prevent the rise of groups or sources of authority outside the control of the Government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It stated that &quot;Unregistered religious groups [in China] ... experience varying degrees of official interference, harassment, and repression.&quot; Its crackdown on Falun Gong is cited as the group being a perceived threat to the regime.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a>)</p>
<h4 id="tibetan-buddhism">Tibetan Buddhism</h4>
<p>The government now has the power to ensure that no new living Buddha can be identified: the State Administration for Religious Affairs issued a 14-part regulation to limit the influence of the Dalai Lama. It declared that after 1 September 2007, &quot;[no] living Buddha [may be reincarnated] without government approval, since Qing dynasty, when the live Budda system was established.&quot;.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> When the Dalai Lama announced in May 1995 that a search inside Tibet had identified the 11th reincarnation of the <a href="Panchen_Lama" title="wikilink">Panchen Lama</a> who died in 1989, Beijing was enraged and reinitiated the search under the supervision of a senior Politburo member.

<h3 id="political-freedom">Political freedom</h3>
<p>The PRC is known for its intolerance of organized dissent towards the government. Dissident groups are routinely arrested and imprisoned, often for long periods of time and without trial. Incidents of torture, forced confessions and forced labour are widely reported. Freedom of assembly and association is extremely limited. The most recent mass movement for political freedom was crushed in the <a href="Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989" title="wikilink">Tiananmen Square Massacre</a> in 1989, the estimated death toll of which ranges from about 200 to 10,000 depending on sources.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a><a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>

Having more than one child is illegal and punishable by fines and jail time. Voice of America cites critics who argue that it contributes to <a href="forced_abortions" title="wikilink">forced abortions</a>, human rights violations, female infanticide, abandonment and <a href="Sex-selective_abortion_and_infanticide" title="wikilink">sex-selective abortions</a>, believed to be relatively commonplace in some areas of the country.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> This is thought to have been a significant contribution to the gender imbalance in mainland China, where there is a 118 to 100 ratio of male to female children reported.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a><a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a><a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Forced abortions and sterilizations have also been reported.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a><a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<p>It is also argued that the one-child policy is not effective enough to justify its costs, and that the dramatic decrease in Chinese fertility started before the program began in 1979 for unrelated factors. The policy seems to have had little impact on rural areas (home to about 80% of the population), where birth rates never dropped below 2.5 children per female.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> Nevertheless, the Chinese government and others estimate that at least 250 million births have been prevented by the policy.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2002, the laws related to the One-child policy were amended to allow ethnic minorities and Chinese living in rural areas to have more than one child. The policy was generally not enforced in those areas of the country even before this. The policy has been relaxed in urban areas to allow people who were single children to have two children.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="tibet">Tibet</h3>
<p>In 1951, the People's Liberation Army entered the region of Tibet. After the failed <a href="1959_Tibetan_uprising" title="wikilink">uprising of 1959</a>, the <a href="Tenzin_Gyatso,_14th_Dalai_Lama" title="wikilink">Dalai Lama</a> fled to India. In 1991 the Dalai Lama alleged that Chinese settlers in Tibet were creating &quot;Chinese Apartheid&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new Chinese settlers have created an alternate society: a Chinese apartheid which, denying Tibetans equal social and economic status in our own land, threatens to finally overwhelm and absorb us.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a><a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a selection of speeches by the Dalai Lama published in India in 1998, he referred again to a &quot;Chinese apartheid&quot;, which he argued denied Tibetans equal social and economic status, and furthered the viewpoint that human rights were violated by discrimination against Tibetans under a policy which the Chinese called &quot;segregation and assimilation&quot;.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a><a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> According to the <a href="Heritage_Foundation" title="wikilink">Heritage Foundation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the matter of Tibet's sovereignty is murky, the question about the PRC's treatment of Tibetans is all too clear. After invading Tibet in 1950, the Chinese communists killed over one million Tibetans, destroyed over 6,000 monasteries, and turned Tibet's northeastern province, Amdo, into a gulag housing, by one estimate, up to ten million people. A quarter of a million Chinese troops remain stationed in Tibet. In addition, some 7.5 million Chinese have responded to Beijing's incentives to relocate to Tibet; they now outnumber the 6 million Tibetans. Through what has been termed Chinese apartheid, ethnic Tibetans now have a lower life expectancy, literacy rate, and per capita income than Chinese inhabitants of Tibet.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2001 representatives of Tibet exile groups succeeded in gaining accreditation at a United Nations-sponsored meeting of <a href="non-governmental_organization" title="wikilink">non-governmental organizations</a>. On 29 August Jampal Chosang, the head of the Tibetan coalition, stated that China had introduced &quot;a new form of apartheid&quot; in Tibet because &quot;Tibetan culture, religion, and national identity are considered a threat&quot; to China.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> The Tibet Society of the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">UK</a> has called on the British government to &quot;condemn the apartheid regime in Tibet that treats Tibetans as a minority in their own land and which discriminates against them in the use of their language, in education, in the practice of their religion, and in employment opportunities.&quot;<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>

One such report was released by the <a href="International_Labor_Rights_Fund" title="wikilink">International Labor Rights Fund</a> in October 2006 documenting minimum wage violations, long work hours, and inappropriate actions towards workers by management.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> Workers cannot form their own unions in the workplace, only being able to join State-sanctioned ones.

<p>Although the Chinese government does not interfere with Chinese people's privacy as much as it used to,<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> it still deems it necessary to keep tabs on what people say in public.

<h2 id="counterarguments">Counterarguments</h2>
<p>China's counterarguments come primarily from the idea of &quot;Asian values&quot;<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> and the need to create a &quot;harmonious society&quot;,<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> where the welfare of the collective should always be put ahead of the rights of any individual whenever conflicts between these arise. It is the responsibility of the government to ensure that this is achieved and in some cases, even persuade or force individuals to make sacrifices for society. A strong and stable authority would be required in order to regulate the potentially conflicting interests of the public and enforce a compromise. Governments with curtailed authority would fail to take on such a responsibility.</p>
<p>China (along with a few Asian countries) often point towards the rapid social deterioration, the increasing geographic, religious and racial segregation, the alarmingly rising crime rates, family breakdown, number of industrial actions, vandalism and political extremism in Western societies, which they believe to be a direct result of an excess of individual freedom &lt;U+2013&gt; &lt;U+201C&gt;Too much freedom is dangerous.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> These issues they argue are all violations of human rights and should be taken into account when assessing a country's human right records. Furthermore, the government criticizes the United States, which publishes human rights reports annually, by insisting that the United States has also caused human rights abuses such as the invasion of Iraq.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
<p>The PRC government also argues that the notion of human rights should include economic standards of living and measures of health and economic prosperity.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> On cultural grounds they argue that as the economic, cultural and political situations differ substantially between countries, a universal 'one-size-fits-all' definition of human rights should not apply internationally.</p>

<p>In March 2003, an amendment was made to the <a href="Constitution_of_the_People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">Constitution of the People's Republic of China</a>, stating &quot;The State respects and preserves human rights.&quot;<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> In addition, China was dropped from a list of top 10 human rights violators in the annual human rights report released by the U.S. State Department in 2008, while the report indicated that there were still widespread problems in China.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a></p>
<p>Since 1988, the Chinese government began direct village elections to help maintain social and political order whilst facing rapid economic change. Elections now occur in &quot;about 650,000 villages across China, reaching 75% of the nation's 1.3 billion people,&quot; according to the Carter Center.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> In 2008, <a href="Shenzhen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shenzhen</a> –which enjoys the highest per capita GDP in China– was selected for experimentation, and over 70% of the government officials on the district level are to be directly elected.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> However, in keeping with Communist Party philosophy, candidates must be selected from a pre-approved list, most of whom are Communist party officials.<ref>{{ cite web</p>

The household registration system (<em>hukou</em>) system... specified where people could work and, in particular, classified workers as rural or urban workers. A worker seeking to move from rural agricultural employment to urban non-agricultural work would have to apply through the relevant bureaucracies, and the number of workers allowed to make such moves was tightly controlled. The enforcement of these controls was closely intertwined with state controls on essential goods and services. For instance, unauthorized workers could not qualify for grain rations, employer-provided housing, or health care.&quot; Wildasin, David E. &quot;Factor mobility, risk, inequality, and redistribution&quot; in David Pines, Efraim Sadka, Itzhak Zilcha, <em>Topics in Public Economics: Theoretical and Applied Analysis</em>, Cambridge University Press, 1998, p. 334.<a href="#fnref56" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn64">&quot;Since the middle of 1990&lt;U+2019&gt;s the <em>hukou</em> system has been gradually relaxed. First, rural residents were permitted to buy a temporary (usually one year) urban residential card, which allowed them to work legally. The fees for such permits gradually decreased to a fairly affordable level. Beginning from 1998, parents have been able to pass down their hukou either through the father&lt;U+2019&gt;s or the mother&lt;U+2019&gt;s line, hence the triple discrimination against rural women has been alleviated. In 2003, after the uproar surrounding the death of Sun Zhigang alarmed the authorities, the laws on jailing and repatriating &lt;U+2018&gt;undocumented&lt;U+2019&gt; people (those failing to produce local <em>hukou</em>) were abolished. Thus the spatial aspect of the apartheid has now largely been eliminated. However, the substance of the social apartheid in general and the <em>hukou</em> system in particular remains intact. The permanent mark of being an outsider and second class citizen remains, and prevents migrant workers from achieving significant upward mobility in cities. Most decent jobs are still reserved for people who possess local <em>hukou</em>. Migrants can only get badly paid jobs. They still have no future in the cities, and may only work there for some years and then return to their home village.&quot; Au Loong-yu, Nan Shan, Zhang Ping. , Committee for Asian Women, May 2007, p. 11.<a href="#fnref64" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

China's household registration system (HRS) maintains a rigid distinction between China's rural population, that is people who have a rural hukou (household registration), and urban residents, who have an urban hukou. Movement of rural people into the cities is restricted, and they require a permit to stay and work temporarily in any urban area. If caught without these permits, people with a rural hukou could be placed in a detention centre, fined, and deported back to their home village or home town (that is, 'endorsed out', to borrow a South African expression). Those with a rural hukou who obtain a temporary employment permit to work in an urban area are not entitled to the pensions, schooling, unemployment benefits, etc. enjoyed by those who have an urban hukou. There are, in short, some obvious and significant similarities between the two countries, but a closer examination is required before we can consider equating China's pass system with what operated in apartheid South Africa.&quot; <a href="..." class="uri" title="wikilink">...</a>&quot; The combination of these four factors may explain why China has developed a quasi-apartheid pass system. The fact that it has such a system underlines the reality that China's export-oriented economic growth has been built, in large measure, on the labour of poorly paid and appallingly treated migrant workers. In China today, as in apartheid South Africa, the pass system is associated with massive abuses of human rights, and its retention should be opposed.&quot;<a href="#fnref74" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
