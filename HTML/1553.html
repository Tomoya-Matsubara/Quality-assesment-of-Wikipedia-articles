<p><strong>Alfred Matthew Yankovic</strong> (<a href="International_Phonetic_Alphabet" title="wikilink">IPA pronunciation</a>: ; last syllable rhymes with &quot;stick&quot;) was born on <a href="October_23" title="wikilink">October 23</a>, <a href="1959" class="uri" title="wikilink">1959</a> in <a href="Downey,_California" title="wikilink">Downey, California</a>. Better known as <strong>&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic</strong>, he is an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="musician" class="uri" title="wikilink">musician</a>, <a href="satire" title="wikilink">satirist</a>, <a href="parody" title="wikilink">parodist</a>, <a href="accordion" title="wikilink">accordionist</a>, and <a href="television_producer" title="wikilink">television producer</a>. Yankovic is known in particular for his humorous songs that make light of <a href="popular_culture" title="wikilink">popular culture</a> and that parody specific songs by contemporary musical acts.</p>
<p>Since receiving his first accordion lesson a day before his seventh birthday, he has recorded more than 150 parody and original songs and sold more comedy albums than any other artist.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> His works have earned him three <a href="Grammy_Award" title="wikilink">Grammy Awards</a> amongst nine nominations, and three <a href="RIAA_certification" title="wikilink">gold</a> and five <a href="RIAA_certification" title="wikilink">platinum records</a> in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. Yankovic's first Top 10 <a href="Billboard" class="uri" title="wikilink">Billboard</a> <a href="Straight_Outta_Lynwood" title="wikilink">album</a> and <a href="White_&amp;_Nerdy" title="wikilink">single</a> were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career.</p>
<p>In addition to recording his albums, Yankovic has written and starred in his <a href="UHF_(film)" title="wikilink">own movie</a> and <a href="The_Weird_Al_Show" title="wikilink">television show</a>, directed <a href="music_video" title="wikilink">music videos</a> for himself and other artists including <a href="Ben_Folds" title="wikilink">Ben Folds</a> and <a href="Hanson_(band)" title="wikilink">Hanson</a>, and had guest appearances in television shows such as <em><a href="The_Simpsons" title="wikilink">The Simpsons</a></em> and <em><a href="Behind_the_Music" title="wikilink">Behind the Music</a></em>. Because of his success and popularity, users of Internet <a href="file_sharing" title="wikilink">file sharing</a> networks often misattribute many parodies to Yankovic. Because some of these misattributed songs are racist or otherwise offensive, this often results in some listeners forging a negative image of the family-friendly Yankovic, much to his frustration.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>The only child of Nick Yankovic (<a href="June_4" title="wikilink">June 4</a>, <a href="1917" class="uri" title="wikilink">1917</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="April_9" title="wikilink">April 9</a>, <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a>) and Mary Yankovic (<a href="February_7" title="wikilink">February 7</a>, <a href="1923" class="uri" title="wikilink">1923</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="April_9" title="wikilink">April 9</a>, <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a>), Alfred was born in <a href="Downey,_California" title="wikilink">Downey, California</a> and raised in the neighboring town of <a href="Lynwood,_California" title="wikilink">Lynwood</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Nick was born in <a href="Kansas_City,_Kansas" title="wikilink">Kansas City, Kansas</a> and began living in California after <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, during which he was awarded a <a href="Silver_Star" title="wikilink">Silver Star</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He believed &quot;the key to success&quot; was &quot;doing for a living whatever makes you happy&quot; and often reminded his son of this philosophy.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Nick married Mary Vivalda in 1949. Mary, who had come to California from Kentucky, gave birth to Alfred ten years later.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Alfred's first accordion lesson was <a href="October_22" title="wikilink">October 22</a>, <a href="1966" class="uri" title="wikilink">1966</a> a day before his seventh birthday. A door-to-door salesman traveling the Lynwood neighborhood offered the Yankovic parents a choice of accordion or guitar lessons for a local music school. Yankovic claims the reason his parents chose accordion over <a href="guitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitar</a> was &quot;they figured there should be at least one more accordion-playing Yankovic in the world,&quot; referring to <a href="Frankie_Yankovic" title="wikilink">Frankie Yankovic</a>, to whom he is no relation.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> He continued lessons at the school for three years before continuing to learn on his own.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Yankovic's early accordion role models include Frankie Yankovic and <a href="Myron_Floren" title="wikilink">Myron Floren</a> (the accordionist on <em><a href="The_Lawrence_Welk_Show" title="wikilink">The Lawrence Welk Show</a></em>). In the 1970s, Yankovic was a big fan of <a href="Elton_John" title="wikilink">Elton John</a> and claims John's <em><a href="Goodbye_Yellow_Brick_Road" title="wikilink">Goodbye Yellow Brick Road</a></em> album &quot;was partly how I learned to play rock 'n roll on the accordion.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He would repeatedly play the album and try to play along on his accordion.</p>
<p>Yankovic began <a href="kindergarten" class="uri" title="wikilink">kindergarten</a> a year earlier than most children, and he skipped the second grade. &quot;My classmates seemed to think I was some kind of rocket scientist so I was labeled a nerd early on,&quot; he recalls.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> As his unique schooling left him two years younger than most of his classmates, Yankovic was not interested in large social events at school. He claims to have been a &quot;straight A&quot; student throughout high school, which earned him the honor of becoming <a href="valedictorian" class="uri" title="wikilink">valedictorian</a> of his senior class.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Yankovic was fairly active in his school's extracurricular programs, including the <a href="National_Forensic_League" title="wikilink">National Forensic League</a> (in which he &quot;usually brought home some kind of trophy&quot;); a play based upon <em><a href="Rebel_Without_a_Cause" title="wikilink">Rebel Without a Cause</a></em>; the yearbook program (for which he wrote most of the captions); and the Volcano Worshippers Club, &quot;which did absolutely nothing. We started the club just to get an extra picture of ourselves in the yearbook.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>A fan of <a href="Dr._Demento" title="wikilink">Dr. Demento</a>'s <a href="radio" class="uri" title="wikilink">radio</a> show (a <a href="comedy" class="uri" title="wikilink">comedy</a> radio program featuring humorous music) since 1971 or 1972, Yankovic first sent Demento a homemade tape in <a href="1976" class="uri" title="wikilink">1976</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The tape's first song was entitled &quot;Belvedere Cruisin',&quot; a song about his family's <a href="Plymouth_Belvedere" title="wikilink">current vehicle</a>; another song included on the tape which never received airtime was entitled &quot;Dr. D Superstar,&quot; a parody of the title song from the musical <em><a href="Jesus_Christ_Superstar" title="wikilink">Jesus Christ Superstar</a></em>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Demento admits &quot;'Belvedere Cruising'[sic] might not have been the very best song I ever heard, but it had some clever lines [...] I put the tape on the air immediately.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Yankovic was a <a href="Student" title="wikilink">senior</a> at Lynwood High School at the time, but that tape was the start of his eventual career.</p>
<p>During Yankovic's sophomore year as an <a href="architecture" class="uri" title="wikilink">architecture</a> student at <a href="California_Polytechnic_State_University" title="wikilink">Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</a>, he became a <a href="disc_jockey" title="wikilink">disc jockey</a> at the university's radio station, <a href="KCPR" class="uri" title="wikilink">KCPR</a>. According to Yankovic, he had been called &quot;Weird Al&quot; in the university's <a href="dormitory" class="uri" title="wikilink">dormitory</a>, but he &quot;took it on professionally&quot; as his persona for the station.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In summer 1979, shortly before his senior year, &quot;<a href="My_Sharona" title="wikilink">My Sharona</a>&quot; by <a href="The_Knack" title="wikilink">The Knack</a> was on the charts and Yankovic took his accordion into the restroom across the hall from the radio station (to take advantage of the <a href="echo_chamber" title="wikilink">echo chamber</a> acoustics) and recorded a parody entitled &quot;<a href="My_Bologna" title="wikilink">My Bologna</a>&quot; and sent it to Dr. Demento, whose listeners frequently requested the parody. Yankovic met The Knack after a show at his college, and introduced himself as the author of &quot;My Bologna.&quot; Knack's lead singer, <a href="Doug_Fieger" title="wikilink">Doug Fieger</a>, admitted he liked the song and suggested that <a href="Capitol_Records" title="wikilink">Capitol Records</a> vice president Rupert Perry release the song as a single.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> &quot;My Bologna&quot; was released as a single with &quot;School Cafeteria&quot; as its B-side, and the label gave Yankovic a six month recording contract.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Yankovic, who was &quot;only getting average grades&quot; in his architecture degree, began to realise his comedy music may hold a future career for him.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="September_14" title="wikilink">September 14</a>, <a href="1980" class="uri" title="wikilink">1980</a>, Yankovic was a guest on the Dr. Demento Show, where he was to record a newly-written parody live on the air. The song was called &quot;<a href="Another_One_Rides_the_Bus" title="wikilink">Another One Rides the Bus</a>,&quot; a parody of <a href="Queen_(band)" title="wikilink">Queen</a>'s hit, &quot;<a href="Another_One_Bites_the_Dust" title="wikilink">Another One Bites the Dust</a>.&quot; While practicing the song outside the sound booth, he met <a href="Jon_Schwartz_(drummer)" title="wikilink">Jon &quot;Bermuda&quot; Schwartz</a>, who told him he was a drummer and agreed to bang on Yankovic's accordion case to help Yankovic keep steady beat to the song. They rehearsed the song just a few times before recording the song live.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> &quot;Another One Rides the Bus&quot; became so popular that Yankovic's first television appearance was a performance of the song on <em>The Tomorrow Show</em> with <a href="Tom_Snyder" title="wikilink">Tom Snyder</a>. On the show, Yankovic played his accordion, and again, Schwartz banged on the accordion case in addition to providing comical sound effects.</p>
<p>1981 brought Yankovic on tour for the first time as part of Dr. Demento's stage show. His stage act in a <a href="Phoenix,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Phoenix, Arizona</a> nightclub caught the eye of manager Jay Levey, who was &quot;blown away.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Levey asked Yankovic if he had considered creating a full <a href="Band_(music)" title="wikilink">band</a> and doing his music as a career. Yankovic agreed, so Levey held auditions. <a href="Steve_Jay" title="wikilink">Steve Jay</a> became Yankovic's <a href="bass_guitar" title="wikilink">bass</a> player, and Jay's friend <a href="Jim_West_(guitarist)" title="wikilink">Jim West</a> played <a href="guitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitar</a>. Schwartz continued on <a href="drums" class="uri" title="wikilink">drums</a>. Yankovic's first show with the 1981 band was not successful at all. Yankovic and his band were the opening act for <a href="Missing_Persons" title="wikilink">Missing Persons</a>. The unimpressed audience threw items at the group, and they were booed off the stage.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1982, Yankovic recorded &quot;I Love Rocky Road,&quot; due to the influence of his new producer, <a href="Rick_Derringer" title="wikilink">Rick Derringer</a>. It managed to become a hit on Top 40 radio, leading to Yankovic's signing with <a href="Scotti_Bros._Records" title="wikilink">Scotti Bros. Records</a>. In 1983, Yankovic's first <a href="&quot;Weird_Al&quot;_Yankovic_(album)" title="wikilink">self-titled album</a> was released on Scotti Bros.</p>
<p>In 1985, Yankovic co-wrote and starred in a <a href="mockumentary" class="uri" title="wikilink">mockumentary</a> of his own life entitled <em><a href="The_Compleat_Al" title="wikilink">The Compleat Al</a></em> that intertwined fact and fiction of his life up to that point. The movie also featured some clips from Yankovic's trip to <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a> and some clips from the <em><a href="Al_TV" title="wikilink">Al TV</a></em> specials. <em>The Compleat Al</em> was co-directed by Jay Levey, who would direct <em><a href="UHF_(film)" title="wikilink">UHF</a></em> four years later. Also released around the same time as <em>The Compleat Al</em> was <em>The Authorized Al</em>, a biographical book based on the film. The book, resembling a scrapbook, included real and fictional, humorous photographs and documents.</p>
<p>In 1991, <a href="Rub&lt;U+00E9&gt;n_Valtierra" title="wikilink">Rub&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Valtierra</a> joined the band on keyboards, allowing Yankovic to concentrate more on singing during concerts.</p>
<p>A factual biographical booklet of Yankovic's life, written by Dr. Demento, was released with the 1994 box set compilation <em><a href="Permanent_Record:_Al_In_The_Box" title="wikilink">Permanent Record: Al In The Box</a></em> and is available for viewing <a href="http://php.indiana.edu/~jbmorris/FAQ/al.booklet">online</a>. The Dr. Demento Society, which issues yearly <a href="Christmas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christmas</a> re-releases of material from Dr. Demento's Basement Tapes, often includes unreleased tracks from Yankovic's vaults, such as &quot;Pacman,&quot; &quot;It's Still Billy Joel To Me&quot; or the live version of &quot;School Cafeteria.&quot;</p>

</figure>
<p>In January 1998, Yankovic had <a href="LASIK" class="uri" title="wikilink">LASIK</a> eye surgery and shaved off his <a href="mustache" class="uri" title="wikilink">mustache</a>, radically changing his trademark look. Yankovic reasoned, &quot;If <a href="Madonna_(entertainer)" title="wikilink">Madonna</a>'s allowed to reinvent herself every 15 minutes, I figure I should be good for a change at least once every couple of decades.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He parodied the reaction to this &quot;new look&quot; in a commercial for his nonexistent <a href="MTV_Unplugged" title="wikilink">MTV Unplugged</a> special. The commercial featured Yankovic in the short-haired wig from the music video for <em><a href="The_Saga_Begins" title="wikilink">The Saga Begins</a></em>, claiming his new look was an attempt to &quot;get back to the core of what I'm all about,&quot; that being &quot;the music.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Yankovic married Suzanne Krajewski on <a href="February_10" title="wikilink">February 10</a>, <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>. Their daughter, Nina, was born <a href="February_11" title="wikilink">February 11</a>, <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>. They also have a pet <a href="poodle" class="uri" title="wikilink">poodle</a>, Bela (pictured atop Yankovic's head on the cover of his album, <em><a href="Poodle_Hat" title="wikilink">Poodle Hat</a></em>), and a pet <a href="cockatiel" class="uri" title="wikilink">cockatiel</a> named Bo.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="April_9" title="wikilink">April 9</a>, <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a>, Yankovic's parents, Nick, 86, and Mary, 81, were found dead in their <a href="Fallbrook,_California" title="wikilink">Fallbrook, California</a> home, apparently the victims of <a href="carbon_monoxide_poisoning" title="wikilink">carbon monoxide poisoning</a> from their fireplace that had been recently lit. The flue was closed, which trapped the carbon monoxide gas inside the house, suffocating them. An hour after his wife notified him of his parents' death, Yankovic went on with his concert in <a href="Mankato,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Mankato, Minnesota</a>, saying that &quot;since my music had helped many of my fans through tough times, maybe it would work for me as well&quot; and that it would &quot;at least ... give me a break from sobbing all the time.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Yankovic's career in novelty and comedy music has outlasted many of his &quot;mainstream&quot; parody targets, such as <a href="Toni_Basil" title="wikilink">Toni Basil</a>, <a href="MC_Hammer" title="wikilink">MC Hammer</a>, <a href="Men_Without_Hats" title="wikilink">Men Without Hats</a> and <a href="Crash_Test_Dummies" title="wikilink">Crash Test Dummies</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Furthermore, most <a href="Novelty_song" title="wikilink">novelty artists</a> are often <a href="one_hit_wonder" title="wikilink">one hit wonders</a>, but Yankovic's continued success (including a top 10 single and album in 2006) has enabled him to escape the &quot;one hit wonder&quot; stigma often associated with novelty music.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="music">Music</h3>

<p>While Yankovic's song parodies (such as &quot;<a href="Eat_It" title="wikilink">Eat It</a>&quot;) have resulted in success on the Billboard charts (<em>see <a href="List_of_singles_by_&quot;Weird_Al&quot;_Yankovic" title="wikilink">List of singles by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic</a></em>), he has actually recorded a greater number of original humorous songs (&quot;<a href="You_Don&#39;t_Love_Me_Anymore" title="wikilink">You Don't Love Me Anymore</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="One_More_Minute" title="wikilink">One More Minute</a>&quot;).<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> His work depends largely on the satirizing of <a href="popular_culture" title="wikilink">popular culture</a>, including television (<em>see <a href="The_TV_Album" title="wikilink">The TV Album</a></em>), movies (&quot;<a href="The_Saga_Begins" title="wikilink">The Saga Begins</a>&quot;), food (<em>see <a href="The_Food_Album" title="wikilink">The Food Album</a></em>), popular music (the polkas), and sometimes issues in contemporary news (&quot;<a href="Headline_News_(song)" title="wikilink">Headline News</a>&quot;).</p>
<p>Although many of Yankovic's songs are parodies of contemporary radio hits, it is rare that the song's primary topic concerns lampooning the original artist as a person. Yankovic's humour lies more in creating unexpected incongruity between an artist's image and the topic of the song, contrasting the style of the song with its content (such as the <a href="rap" class="uri" title="wikilink">rap</a> song &quot;<a href="White_&amp;_Nerdy" title="wikilink">White &amp; Nerdy</a>&quot;), or in pointing out trends or works which have become pop culture clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;s (such as &quot;eBay&quot; and &quot;<a href="Don&#39;t_Download_This_Song" title="wikilink">Don't Download This Song</a>&quot;).</p>
<p>Unlike other parody artists such as <a href="Tom_Lehrer" title="wikilink">Tom Lehrer</a> and <a href="Allan_Sherman" title="wikilink">Allan Sherman</a>, Yankovic strives to keep the backing music in his parodies the same as the original. While Lehrer reproduced the songs on piano and Sherman reproduced them on guitar, Yankovic and his band essentially play the original song with new lyrics. Instead of using instrumental versions of the original songs, Yankovic and his band transcribe the original song by ear and re-record the song for Yankovic's parody version.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to his parodies, Yankovic also includes a medley of various songs on most albums, each one reinterpreted as a <a href="polka" class="uri" title="wikilink">polka</a>, with the choruses or memorable lines of various songs juxtaposed for humorous effect. Yankovic has been known to say that converting these songs to polka was &quot;...the way God intended.&quot; Because the polkas have become a staple of Yankovic's albums, he has said he tries to include one on each album because &quot;fans would be rioting in the streets, I think, if I didn't do a polka medley.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Some of Yankovic's original songs are <a href="pastiche" title="wikilink">pastiches</a> or &quot;style parodies,&quot; for which he chooses a band's entire body of work to honor/parody, rather than any single hit by that band (for example, <a href="Devo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Devo</a> with &quot;<a href="Dare_to_Be_Stupid_(song)" title="wikilink">Dare to Be Stupid</a>&quot;, <a href="They_Might_Be_Giants" title="wikilink">They Might Be Giants</a> with &quot;Everything You Know is Wrong&quot;, or <a href="Talking_Heads" title="wikilink">Talking Heads</a> with &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;)<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a>. Some style parodies are in the style of a <a href="genre" class="uri" title="wikilink">genre</a> of music, rather than a specific band (for example, <a href="country_music" title="wikilink">country music</a> with &quot;Good Enough For Now&quot;).</p>
<p>Yankovic has contributed original songs to several <a href="film" title="wikilink">films</a> (&quot;<a href="This_Is_the_Life_(&quot;Weird_Al&quot;_Yankovic_song)" title="wikilink">This Is the Life</a>&quot; from <em><a href="Johnny_Dangerously" title="wikilink">Johnny Dangerously</a></em>; &quot;<a href="Polkamon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Polkamon</a>&quot; from the movie <em><a href="Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon:_The_Movie_2000" title="wikilink">Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon: The Movie 2000</a></em>, and a parody of the <a href="James_Bond" title="wikilink">James Bond</a> title sequence in <em><a href="Spy_Hard" title="wikilink">Spy Hard</a></em>), in addition to his own film, <em><a href="UHF_(film)" title="wikilink">UHF</a></em>. Other songs of his have appeared in films or television series as well, such as &quot;<a href="Dare_to_Be_Stupid" title="wikilink">Dare to Be Stupid</a>&quot; in <em><a href="Transformers:_The_Movie" title="wikilink">Transformers: The Movie</a></em>.</p>
<p>Yankovic's recurring jokes include the number <a href="27_(number)" title="wikilink">27</a> (as seen on the covers for <a href="Running_With_Scissors_(album)" title="wikilink">Running With Scissors</a> and <a href="Poodle_Hat" title="wikilink">Poodle Hat</a>) and the names Bob, (the <a href="Al_TV" title="wikilink">Al TV</a> interviews often mention the name<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a>) Frank (&quot;Frank's 2000&quot; TV&quot;) and Leroy Finkelstein (music video for &quot;<a href="I_Lost_On_Jeopardy" title="wikilink">I Lost On Jeopardy</a>&quot;). Also, a <a href="hamster" class="uri" title="wikilink">hamster</a> called <a href="Harvey_the_Wonder_Hamster" title="wikilink">Harvey the Wonder Hamster</a> is a recurring character in <a href="The_Weird_Al_Show" title="wikilink">The Weird Al Show</a> and the <a href="Al_TV" title="wikilink">Al TV</a> specials. The Harvey the Wonder Hamster theme song was first officially released on the <a href="Alapalooza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alapalooza</a> album. Yankovic has also put two <a href="backmasking" class="uri" title="wikilink">backmasking</a> messages into his songs.

<p>His latest three album releases feature the longest songs Yankovic has ever released. The &quot;<a href="Albuquerque_(song)" title="wikilink">Albuquerque</a>&quot; track from <em><a href="Running_with_Scissors_(album)" title="wikilink">Running with Scissors</a></em> is 11 minutes and 23 seconds; &quot;Genius in France&quot; from <em><a href="Poodle_Hat" title="wikilink">Poodle Hat</a></em> runs for 8 minutes and 56 seconds; &quot;Trapped in the Drive Thru&quot; from <em><a href="Straight_Outta_Lynwood" title="wikilink">Straight Outta Lynwood</a></em> is 10 minutes and 53 seconds long. To date, these &quot;epic&quot; songs have never been played live because of their length and complexity, except one performance of &quot;Albuquerque&quot; in <a href="Albuquerque,_New_Mexico" title="wikilink">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<h5 id="positive">Positive</h5>
<p><a href="Kurt_Cobain" title="wikilink">Kurt Cobain</a> of <a href="Nirvana_(band)" title="wikilink">Nirvana</a> said that the band felt they had &quot;made it&quot; after Yankovic recorded &quot;<a href="Smells_Like_Nirvana" title="wikilink">Smells Like Nirvana</a>,&quot; a parody of the grunge band's smash hit, &quot;<a href="Smells_Like_Teen_Spirit" title="wikilink">Smells Like Teen Spirit</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> On his <em>Behind the Music</em> special, Yankovic stated that when he called Cobain to ask if he could parody the song, Cobain gave him permission, then paused and asked, &quot;Um...it's not gonna be about food, is it?&quot; Yankovic responded with &quot;No, it'll be about how no one can understand your lyrics.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Michael_Jackson" title="wikilink">Michael Jackson</a> is also a big fan of Yankovic. Jackson has twice allowed him to parody his songs (&quot;<a href="Beat_It" title="wikilink">Beat It</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Bad_(song)" title="wikilink">Bad</a>&quot; became &quot;<a href="Eat_It" title="wikilink">Eat It</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Fat_(song)" title="wikilink">Fat</a>&quot;). When he granted Yankovic permission to do &quot;Fat,&quot; Jackson allowed him to use the same set built for his own &quot;Bad&quot; video from the <em><a href="Moonwalker" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moonwalker</a></em> video.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Though Jackson was a good sport about &quot;Eat It&quot; and &quot;Fat,&quot; he requested that Yankovic not record a parody of &quot;<a href="Black_or_White_(song)" title="wikilink">Black or White</a>,&quot; because he felt the message was too important. However, Yankovic has performed a concert-only parody &quot;Snack All Night&quot; in some of his live shows.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Yankovic also has a cameo appearance, along with many other celebrities, in Jackson's music video for <a href="Liberian_Girl" title="wikilink">Liberian Girl</a>.</p>
<p>The song &quot;<a href="The_Saga_Begins" title="wikilink">The Saga Begins</a>&quot; (a parody of <a href="Don_McLean" title="wikilink">Don McLean</a>'s &quot;<a href="American_Pie_(song)" title="wikilink">American Pie</a>&quot;) accurately states the entire plot of <em><a href="Star_Wars_Episode_I:_The_Phantom_Menace" title="wikilink">The Phantom Menace</a></em>, despite being written before the film's release. Yankovic got the plot details from <a href="rumour" class="uri" title="wikilink">rumour</a> websites. He was slightly unsure about <a href="Darth_Vader" title="wikilink">Anakin</a> proposing to <a href="Padm&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Amidala" title="wikilink">Amidala</a>, so he attended a $500 screening to confirm. McLean was pleased with the parody, and even told Yankovic that the parody's lyrics sometimes enter his mind during live performances.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Additionally, <a href="George_Lucas" title="wikilink">George Lucas</a> loved the song and a <a href="LucasFilm" class="uri" title="wikilink">LucasFilm</a> representative told Yankovic &quot;You should have seen the smile on his face.&quot;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Chamillionaire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chamillionaire</a> also put Weird Al's parody &quot;<a href="White_&amp;_Nerdy" title="wikilink">White &amp; Nerdy</a>&quot; on his official <a href="MySpace" class="uri" title="wikilink">MySpace</a> page writing, &quot;He's actually <a href="rapping" class="uri" title="wikilink">rapping</a> pretty good on it, it's crazy [...] I didn't know he could rap like that.&quot; He also wrote &quot;It's really an honor when he does that.

<h5 id="negative">Negative</h5>
<p>One of Yankovic's most controversial parodies was 1996's &quot;<a href="Amish_Paradise" title="wikilink">Amish Paradise</a>,&quot; based on &quot;<a href="Gangsta&#39;s_Paradise_(song)" title="wikilink">Gangsta's Paradise</a>&quot; by hip-hop artist <a href="Coolio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Coolio</a>. Reportedly, Coolio's label gave Yankovic the impression that Coolio had granted permission to record the parody, but Coolio maintains that he never did. While Coolio claimed he was upset, legal action never materialized, and Coolio accepted <a href="Royalties" title="wikilink">royalty</a> payments for the song. After this controversy, Yankovic has always made sure to speak <em>directly with the artist</em> of every song he parodied. At the <a href="XM_Satellite_Radio" title="wikilink">XM Satellite Radio</a> booth at the 2006 <a href="Consumer_Electronics_Show" title="wikilink">Consumer Electronics Show</a> Yankovic and Coolio made peace. On his website, Yankovic wrote of this event, &quot;I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t remember what we said to each other exactly, but it was all very friendly. I doubt I&lt;U+2019&gt;ll be invited to Coolio&lt;U+2019&gt;s next birthday party, but at least I can stop wearing that bulletproof vest to the mall.&quot;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2003, Yankovic was denied permission to make a video for &quot;Couch Potato,&quot; his parody of <a href="Eminem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eminem</a>'s &quot;<a href="Lose_Yourself" title="wikilink">Lose Yourself</a>&quot;:</p>

<p>For the <em>Poodle Hat</em> <a href="Al_TV" title="wikilink">Al TV</a> special, Yankovic raised the question of artistic expression in a false interview with Eminem. As usual, Yankovic edited the footage of a previous Eminem interview and inserted himself asking questions such that it made Eminem sound like a hypocrite on the matter of an artist's right to <a href="free_speech" title="wikilink">free speech</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="refused-parodies">Refused parodies</h5>
<p>On numerous occasions, <a href="Prince_(artist)" title="wikilink">Prince</a> has refused Yankovic permission to record parodies of his songs. However, Yankovic has stated in interviews that he has &quot;approached him every few years [to] see if he's lightened up.&quot;<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Led_Zeppelin" title="wikilink">Led Zeppelin</a> guitarist <a href="Jimmy_Page" title="wikilink">Jimmy Page</a> is a self-proclaimed Yankovic fan, but when Yankovic wished to create a polka medley of Led Zeppelin songs, Page refused.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Yankovic was, however, allowed to re-record a sample of &quot;<a href="Black_Dog_(song)" title="wikilink">Black Dog</a>&quot; for a segment of &quot;Trapped in the Drive Thru.&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Paul_McCartney" title="wikilink">Paul McCartney</a>, also a Yankovic fan, refused Yankovic permission to record a parody of <a href="Wings_(band)" title="wikilink">Wings</a>' &quot;<a href="Live_and_Let_Die_(song)" title="wikilink">Live and Let Die</a>,&quot; entitled &quot;Chicken Pot Pie&quot; because McCartney is a vegetarian.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> However, like &quot;Snack All Night,&quot; &quot;Chicken Pot Pie&quot; has been performed numerous times in concert.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> This is not unusual for Yankovic, as his concerts often feature parodies for which the artist did not give permission or could not otherwise be released.</p>
<p>In 2006, Yankovic gained <a href="James_Blunt" title="wikilink">James Blunt</a>'s permission to record a parody of &quot;<a href="You&#39;re_Beautiful" title="wikilink">You're Beautiful</a>.&quot; However, after Yankovic had recorded &quot;<a href="You&#39;re_Pitiful" title="wikilink">You're Pitiful</a>,&quot; Blunt's label, <a href="Atlantic_Records" title="wikilink">Atlantic Records</a>, rescinded this permission. The parody was pulled from Yankovic's <em>Straight Outta Lynwood</em> due to his label's unwillingness to &quot;go to war&quot; with Atlantic. Yankovic released the song as a free download on his <a href="MySpace" class="uri" title="wikilink">MySpace</a> profile, as well as his official website, since it was not Blunt himself objecting to the parody.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> In the &quot;<a href="White_&amp;_Nerdy" title="wikilink">White &amp; Nerdy</a>&quot; video, Yankovic's character is seen vandalising the record label's <a href="Wikipedia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wikipedia</a> entry with the exclamation &quot;YOU SUCK!&quot; After the video was released online, Wikipedia's <a href="Atlantic_Records" title="wikilink">Atlantic Records</a> article mirrored the video with numerous &quot;<a href="Wikipedia:Vandalism" title="wikilink">vandals</a>&quot; editing it. Yankovic has said that he does not approve of the vandalism, though he admits being amused by it.

<h4 id="live-performances">Live performances</h4>
<p>Yankovic often describes his live concert performances as a &quot;rock and comedy multimedia extravaganza&quot;.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Apart from Yankovic and his band performing his classic and contemporary hits, staples of Yankovic's live performances include a medley of parodies, many costume changes between songs, and a video screen on which various clips are played during the costume changes.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> A concert from Yankovic's 1999 tour for the <em><a href="Running_With_Scissors" title="wikilink">Running With Scissors</a></em> album (<em>Touring With Scissors</em>) was released on VHS in 1999 and on DVD in 2000.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Titled <em><a href="&quot;Weird_Al&quot;_Yankovic_Live!" title="wikilink">&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic Live!</a></em>, the concert was recorded at the <a href="Marin_County_Civic_Center" title="wikilink">Marin County Civic Center</a> in <a href="San_Rafael,_California" title="wikilink">San Rafael, California</a> on <a href="October_2" title="wikilink">October 2</a>, <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> For legal reasons, video clips (apart from those for Yankovic's own music videos) could not be shown for the home release, and unreleased parodies were removed from the parody medley for the performance.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="uhf">UHF</h3>

<p><img src="UHFposter.jpg" title="fig:UHF original theatrical poster" alt="UHF original theatrical poster" width="125" /> In 1989, Yankovic starred in a full-length feature film, co-written by himself and manager Jay Levey, and filmed in <a href="Tulsa,_Oklahoma" title="wikilink">Tulsa, Oklahoma</a> called <em><a href="UHF_(film)" title="wikilink">UHF</a></em>.

<p>The film has since become a <a href="cult_classic" title="wikilink">cult classic</a>, with out-of-print copies of the VHS getting as high as $100 on <a href="eBay" class="uri" title="wikilink">eBay</a> until the release of the <a href="DVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD</a> in 2002. Yankovic occasionally shows clips from the film at his concerts (to which <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="wikilink">MGM</a>, the film's current owner, initially objected in the form of a <a href="cease_and_desist" title="wikilink">cease and desist</a> letter<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a>). To apparently make it more accessible, the film was titled <em>The Vidiot From UHF</em> in Australia and parts of Europe.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>UHF shows the creation of Yankovic's signature food&lt;U+2014&gt;the <a href="Twinkie-wiener_sandwich" title="wikilink">Twinkie-wiener sandwich</a>.

<h3 id="notable-television-appearances">Notable television appearances</h3>
<p><img src="WeirdAlShow_Complete.jpg" title="fig:DVD cover for The Weird Al Show" alt="DVD cover for The Weird Al Show" width="125" /> Yankovic had a TV series called <em><a href="The_Weird_Al_Show" title="wikilink">The Weird Al Show</a></em>, which aired from September 1997 to September 1998 on <a href="CBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">CBS</a>. Though the show appeared to be geared at children, the humor was really more for his adult fans. The entire series was released on DVD by <a href="Shout!_Factory" title="wikilink">Shout! Factory</a> on August 15, 2006.</p>
<p>Yankovic has hosted <em><a href="Al_TV" title="wikilink">Al TV</a></em> on <a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a> and <em>Al Music</em> on <a href="MuchMusic" class="uri" title="wikilink">MuchMusic</a> many times, generally coinciding with the release of each new album. For <em>Poodle Hat</em>, AL-TV appeared on <a href="VH1" class="uri" title="wikilink">VH1</a> for the first time. A recurring segment of AL-TV involves Yankovic manipulating interviews for comic effect. He inserts himself into a previously conducted interview with a musician, and then manipulates his questions, resulting in bizarre and comic responses from the celebrity.</p>
<p>VH1 produced a <a href="Behind_the_Music" title="wikilink">Behind the Music</a> episode on Yankovic; however, he was so clean-cut that the producers could not find any of the typical angst-laced problems that make many rock stars' stories compelling (as Yankovic noted in the episode), so they stretched many smaller disappointments and skirmishes during his career into major downfalls to fit the program's classic formula. His two commercial failures, his film <em><a href="UHF_(film)" title="wikilink">UHF</a></em> and his 1986 album <em><a href="Polka_Party!" title="wikilink">Polka Party!</a></em> were presented as having a larger impact on the direction of his career and Coolio's later disapproval of &quot;Amish Paradise&quot; was played up as a large feud. Much was also made over his apparent lack of a love life, though he got married shortly after it aired.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>Yankovic was also featured in a 2003 episode of <a href="The_Simpsons" title="wikilink">The Simpsons</a>, singing &quot;Homer &amp; Marge&quot; (a parody of John Mellencamp's &quot;Jack &amp; Diane&quot;) with his band. The episode, &quot;Three Gays of the Condo,&quot; in which Marge hires &quot;Weird Al&quot; to sing the aforementioned song to Homer in an attempt to reconcile their marriage, later won an Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour).&quot;</p>
