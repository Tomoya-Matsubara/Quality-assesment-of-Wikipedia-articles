Described as &quot;a girl of extremes&quot; by creator <a href="Cecily_von_Ziegesar" title="wikilink">Cecily von Ziegesar</a>,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> she is a comical overachiever who possesses both snobbish and sensitive sides. Due to her position as <a href="Queen_bee_(subculture)" title="wikilink">queen bee</a> of <a href="Manhattan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a>'s social scene, Blair's actions and relations are under constant scrutiny from the mysterious Gossip Girl, a popular <a href="blog" title="wikilink">blogger</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Leighton_Meester" title="wikilink">Leighton Meester</a>, who portrays the character in the television series, has described the character as being insecure about her social status.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> At times, this anxiety creates flaws and complexities which contribute to character development. In Meester's view, the true Blair is ultimately a &quot;good girl&quot; at heart.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Blair has been compared to vintage film and literary figures, including <a href="Becky_Sharp_(character)" title="wikilink">Becky Sharp</a> and <a href="The_Eustace_Diamonds" title="wikilink">Lizzie Eustace</a>. Meester's portrayal has also drawn comparisons to roles played by <a href="Joan_Collins" title="wikilink">Joan Collins</a> and <a href="Audrey_Hepburn" title="wikilink">Audrey Hepburn</a>. She is the most critically acclaimed character of the franchise, while the television character has drawn real-life attention surrounding fashion, physical abuse, and a love triangle.</p>
<h2 id="character-in-print">Character in print</h2>
<p><em><a href="Gossip_Girl_(novel_series)" title="wikilink">Gossip Girl</a></em> is a series of novels about socially prominent young adults in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>. The story primarily follows Blair Waldorf and her friend <a href="Serena_van_der_Woodsen" title="wikilink">Serena van der Woodsen</a> during their years in high school and college. Due to her fame on the Upper East Side, Blair is featured on the Website of &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, an anonymous gossip <a href="blog" title="wikilink">blogger</a> whose 'posts' appear occasionally throughout the story.</p>
<h3 id="novel-series">Novel series</h3>
<p>In the first book, Blair is introduced as a privileged, comically vain overachiever.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> She is described as an alluring brunette,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and occasionally models her appearance and demeanor after famous actresses, including <a href="Marilyn_Monroe" title="wikilink">Marilyn Monroe</a> and, frequently, <a href="Audrey_Hepburn" title="wikilink">Audrey Hepburn</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In early novels, the character is also written as <a href="Bulimia_nervosa" title="wikilink">bulimic</a>.</p>
<p>Blair is largely motivated by matters surrounding family, romance, and ambition. However, her tendency to overachieve can lead to feelings of paranoia, with dramatic or comic results. In a review for <em><a href="The_New_Yorker" title="wikilink">The New Yorker</a></em>, Janet Malcolm remarked that Blair's issues made her &quot;both a broader caricature and a more real person&quot; than the other <em>Gossip Girl</em> characters.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In a 2009 interview, <em>Gossip Girl</em> creator <a href="Cecily_von_Ziegesar" title="wikilink">Cecily von Ziegesar</a> claimed to identify with Blair the most, noting that the character &quot;is so unpredictable and dramatic. Such a bitch, but we understand why she is a bitch and we like her anyway&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="story-lines">Story lines</h4>
<p>Throughout most of the series' run, Blair grapples with a number of changes within her family. Two years prior to the opening novel, Blair's parents divorced after her father revealed himself to be gay. When her mother remarries, and her father leaves the country, Blair has difficulty accepting her stepfather. In addition, her stress over these matters occasionally affects her other relationships.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> However, Blair ultimately remains close to her father Harold, who she often turns to for comfort.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> By contrast, she maintains a tense relationship with her mother Eleanor.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>In the opening novel, Blair learns of an affair between her friend Serena and her boyfriend Nate. This marks the beginning of the story's primary <a href="love_triangle" title="wikilink">love triangle</a>, which recurs throughout the series.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Blair's romantic life has various effects on her character development. After Nate repeatedly hurts her, she eventually refuses to take him back until she believes in his ability to commit to her.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In pursuing Nate, however, Blair herself cheats on her new boyfriend Pete, which results in her losing both of them.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> She eventually begins to acknowledge her mistakes, with her father's help.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> She later grows closer to <a href="Chuck_Bass" title="wikilink">Chuck Bass</a> (which initially occurred in the series' television adaptation), who she'd previously known for years, which leads them to briefly date one another.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Blair is noted for an over-achieving nature, which often appears in humorous scenes. In a review for <em><a href="New_York_(magazine)" title="wikilink">New York</a></em> magazine, Emily Nussbaum lauded one of Blair's fantasies, which involves &quot;joining the Peace Corps, getting a killer tan, winning the Nobel Peace Prize, and having dinner with the president, 'who would then write her a recommendation to <a href="Yale_University" title="wikilink">Yale</a>, and then Yale would fall all over themselves to accept her.' &quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> <em>The New Yorker</em>{{'s}} Janet Malcolm remarked that unlike some of her forerunners in film and literature, &quot;Blair already has all the money and position anyone could want. She is pure naked striving, restlessly seeking an object, any object, and never knowing when enough is enough.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Blair encounters a setback during her interview at Yale by revealing the recent stress in her life, and then kissing her interviewer on the cheek upon dismissal. Her father then makes a donation to the school, though Blair is still wait-listed.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In the twelfth book, <em>I Will Always Love You</em>, it is revealed that she has been admitted to the university.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to her feelings for Nate, Blair is sometimes said to feel competitive with Serena in other areas, including matters of beauty and popularity.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> This also leads to an occasional envy on Blair's part.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> It is unclear how much of Blair's perception of Serena is in line with reality; the narrative describes both characters as &quot;hands down the two hottest girls on the Upper East Side, and maybe all of Manhattan, or even the whole world.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="manga-series">Manga series</h3>
<p><img src="MangaBWaldorf.jpg" title="fig:Blair as she appears in the manga." alt="Blair as she appears in the manga." width="130" /> In 2010, <a href="Yen_Press" title="wikilink">Yen Press</a> began publishing a <a href="manga" class="uri" title="wikilink">manga</a> adaptation titled <em>Gossip Girl: For Your Eyes Only</em>, written and illustrated by HyeKyung Baek. This series adapts notable scenarios from the novel&lt;U+2014&gt;including the triangle with Nate and Serena&lt;U+2014&gt;but also features new material.</p>
<p>After losing her position as queen bee, Blair attempts to regain her former status while adjusting to a less privileged lifestyle.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In addition to this series, Blair also appears in a manga adaptation of the novel <em>Gossip Girl: Psycho Killer</em>, a parody of horror stories.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="tv-series">TV series</h2>
<p>In 2007, <em>Gossip Girl</em> was <a href="Gossip_Girl" title="wikilink">adapted for television</a>. According to Cecily von Ziegesar, the television character is largely faithful to the original.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Among the aspects to be maintained are her admiration for Audrey Hepburn and her interest in Yale University. However, the series excludes Blair's brother Tyler. The show also explores romances between Blair and multiple male leads, resulting in occasional love triangles.</p>
<p>Among fans and the media, Blair's bond with Chuck Bass is commonly known by the portmanteau &quot;Chair&quot;, while her relationship with Dan Humphrey is referred to as &quot;Dair&quot;. The nicknames and viewer interest in these relationships have been recognized by the show's producers.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Blair is confirmed to be pregnant during the fifth season premiere episode.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="casting">Casting</h3>

<p>To prepare for the part of Blair, actress <a href="Leighton_Meester" title="wikilink">Leighton Meester</a>, a natural blonde, dyed her hair brown before auditioning, and also studied the first novel.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> She has described the character as multi-faceted, labeling her &quot;a little bit of everything which is pretty amazing.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Like von Ziegesar, Meester has also claimed to relate to Blair on certain levels. Prior to the show's debut in 2007, the actress stated that, &quot;The only way to play Blair, or any character, and make her human, is to find what she is inside me. And I know I have my insecurities, too.&quot; She went on to say that &quot;the way Blair and I are <em>not</em> alike when it comes to insecurities is: <em>She</em> pays <em>so</em> much attention to hers!&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Meester's casting was described by <em><a href="Yahoo!" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yahoo!</a></em> as a star-making role which moved her &quot;into the pop culture vanguard,&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> while Cecily von Ziegesar has called her a perfect choice.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>In December 2010, Meester revealed plans to leave the show in 2012. <em><a href="E!" class="uri" title="wikilink">E!</a> Online</em> and other outlets speculated that her departure would possibly mark the end of the series.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

She then learns that the actual patient is Serena's brother, Eric, who had been committed after a suicide attempt. Afterward, a remorseful Blair reconciles with Serena.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>After learning that Nate no longer loves her, Blair sleeps with Chuck, eventually falling for him. This leads to a heated affair and an eventual love triangle. Her inability to choose creates much of the first season's story line.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> She also begins a brief power struggle with freshman <a href="Jenny_Humphrey" title="wikilink">Jenny Humphrey</a>.

<p>Amidst the fourth season, the romance between Dan and Blair became a polarizing topic among viewers<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> which also drew significant media interest. Jarett Wieselman of The <em><a href="New_York_Post" title="wikilink">New York Post</a></em> applauded the development, feeling that Blair had &quot;more chemistry&quot; with Dan than with Chuck.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> <em><a href="New_York_(magazine)" title="wikilink">New York</a></em> magazine's Chris Rovzar called Blair and Dan's story line &quot;believable&quot;, citing their common ground in education and taste. Rovzar further stated that &quot;since they live in a world where both only seem to have half a dozen real friends (if that), is it so crazy they'd end up together?&quot;<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Dawn Fallik of <em><a href="The_Wall_Street_Journal" title="wikilink">The Wall Street Journal</a></em> was less positive, asserting that &quot;both characters have been so Blandified that there&lt;U+2019&gt;s no fun left in the show.&quot;<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> A writer for <em>E! Online</em>'s Team WWK labeled the Dan/Blair relationship &quot;nomance nonsense&quot;.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>With regard to Chuck and Blair, Meester stated &quot;I can really relate to it&lt;U+2014&gt;not necessarily because it's this dramatic, tumultuous relationship, but because the way they love each other is very real, and not for the sake of being dramatic. It's actual love. There's nobody for each other but them.&quot;<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Meester also expressed fondness for Dan and Blair, however, stating &quot;I think they're good for each other in a lot of ways, in a way that Chuck and Blair aren't.&quot;<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>Producers initially noticed chemistry between Blair and Dan in the  episode &quot;Bad News Blair&quot;. According to producer Joshua Safran, the creators planned to revisit their relationship once the timing was right. Safran also stated that the outcome wasn't necessarily decided ahead of time. &quot;One thing we are very conscious of&lt;U+2014&gt;and I know some fans get upset about this&lt;U+2014&gt;is we really try to treat the characters as living, breathing, well-rounded individuals. And we're often surprised by where their journeys take them; they open new doors for us all the time.&quot;<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="controversy">Controversy</h4>
<p>Following the  of  Safran spoke on behalf of the series regarding the scene in which Chuck became violent with Blair.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>In response to these comments, Carina MacKenzie of <a href="Zap2it" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zap2it</a> stated &quot;we're left wondering if Safran missed the part where she went home bleeding because Chuck was using physical intimidation to release his own emotions.&quot;<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> While reviewing the episode, Tierney Bricker of Zap2it felt that there were &quot;really no excuses for Chuck Bass anymore.&quot;<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> MacKenzie concluded that Chuck's behavior throughout  fit the signs of an <a href="Relational_aggression" title="wikilink">abusive relationship</a>, citing examples from <em>HelpGuide.org</em>, a non-profit health resource. She noted Chuck's public humiliation of Blair, his attempt to pawn her during a business deal, and his use of physical intimidation. MacKenzie also called the show's explanation &quot;disturbing, particularly given the young, female target demographic of <em>Gossip Girl</em> and The CW.&quot;<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>In a review for the <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em>, Judy Berman addressed Safran's description of Blair during the scene. &quot;Considering how terrified Blair looked at the end of their encounter, and how quickly she got out of there, the show is sending a mixed message at best.&quot; She went on to state &quot;we have no right to expect <em>Gossip Girl</em> to be a paragon of morality, or even realism, but the idea that true love requires taking a shard of glass to the face is disturbing even in this alternate, soap-opera dimension.&quot;<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>

<p>While covering the book series, Janet Malcolm of <em><a href="The_New_Yorker" title="wikilink">The New Yorker</a></em> labeled the character &quot;an <a href="antihero" title="wikilink">antiheroine</a> of the first rank,&quot; and asserted that &quot;the series belongs to awful Blair, who inspires von Ziegesar's highest flights of comic fancy.&quot; She also compared Blair to vintage film and literary figures such as <a href="Becky_Sharp_(character)" title="wikilink">Becky Sharp</a> of <em><a href="Vanity_Fair_(novel)" title="wikilink">Vanity Fair</a></em>, and Lizzie Eustace of <em><a href="The_Eustace_Diamonds" title="wikilink">The Eustace Diamonds</a></em>.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> In addition, the character has drawn comparisons to notable contemporaries, including Lila Fowler of the <em><a href="Sweet_Valley_High" title="wikilink">Sweet Valley High</a></em> series.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 2007 book <em>Children's Literature and Culture</em>, writer Harry Edwin Eiss chastised the depiction of Blair's bulimia. &quot;If handled properly, the inclusion of her illness could have provided a powerful lesson for young adult readers who worry about their weight and food consumption. Unfortunately, Cecily von Ziegesar, the author of the series, presents a seriously flawed treatment of the problem. In a failed attempt at humor, the writer regards Blair's sickness as just another source of gossip.&quot;<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Emily Nussbaum of <em><a href="New_York_(magazine)" title="wikilink">New York</a></em> magazine had similar comments, calling the bulimia &quot;more of an icky weakness than a full-fledged pathology.&quot; However, she went on to commend Blair as &quot;hilariously self-centered&quot;.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
