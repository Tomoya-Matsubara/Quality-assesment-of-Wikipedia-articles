<p>Greg LeMond was a standout junior rider &quot;of superlative quality&quot; and &quot;exceptionally gifted,&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> who quickly established himself as one of the most talented cyclists on the professional circuit.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Respected cycling journalist <a href="John_Wilcockson" title="wikilink">John Wilcockson</a>, who reported the <a href="Tour_de_France" title="wikilink">Tour de France</a> for more than 40 years, described LeMond as a rider who was <em>fuoriclasse</em>.{{#tag:ref|Quote: <em>Fuoriclasse</em> means much more than being gifted.

<p>Borysewicz, whom LeMond described as his &quot;first real coach,&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> wanted to retain his <a href="prot&lt;U+00E9&gt;g&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">prot&lt;U+00E9&gt;g&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> through the next Olympic-cycle and discouraged him from turning pro, but LeMond was determined. Nevertheless, while he was the reigning Junior World Road Champion in 1980, LeMond received no offers, and so in the spring 1980, he joined the U.S. National cycling team for a 6-week European racing campaign. There, he finished third overall in the <a href="Circuit_des_Ardennes_(cycling)" title="wikilink">Circuit des Ardennes</a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> before winning the <a href="Circuit_de_la_Sarthe_(cycling)" title="wikilink">1980 Circuit de la Sarthe</a> stage race in France,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> thereby becoming the first American and youngest rider of any nationality &quot;in the history of the sport to win a major pro-am cycling event [in Europe].&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> That victory, and the subsequent press coverage, raised LeMond's profile in Europe and he was scouted at his next event (the Ruban Granitier Breton stage race) by French cycling coach and <a href="Renault-Elf-Gitane" class="uri" title="wikilink">Renault-Elf-Gitane</a> <a href="directeur_sportif" title="wikilink">directeur sportif</a> <a href="Cyrille_Guimard" title="wikilink">Cyrille Guimard</a>.

He also won the <a href="Coors_Classic" title="wikilink">Coors Classic</a> in the United States, finishing ahead of the 1980 Olympic road champion <a href=":fr:Sergue&lt;U+00EF&gt;_Soukhoroutchenkov" title="wikilink">Sergue&lt;U+00EF&gt; Soukhoroutchenkov</a>, but LeMond considered his third-place overall in the 1981 <a href="Dauphin&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Lib&lt;U+00E9&gt;r&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Dauphin&lt;U+00E9&gt; Lib&lt;U+00E9&gt;r&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> to have been the &quot;major steppingstone,&quot; in his career thus far, saying, &quot;It showed me that I had the kind of climbing ability that you need to win the top European stage races.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="u20131986-grand-tours">1984&lt;U+2013&gt;1986: Grand Tours</h3>
<p>LeMond rode his first <a href="Tour_de_France" title="wikilink">Tour de France</a> in <a href="1984_Tour_de_France" title="wikilink">1984</a> for Renault-Elf-Gitane, under the guidance of Cyrille Guimard. He finished third overall while riding in support of team leader <a href="Laurent_Fignon" title="wikilink">Laurent Fignon</a>, and won the <a href="young_rider_classification_in_the_Tour_de_France" title="wikilink">young rider classification</a>. After this auspicious debut, French businessman <a href="Bernard_Tapie" title="wikilink">Bernard Tapie</a> and his superstar <a href="Bernard_Hinault" title="wikilink">Bernard Hinault</a> approached LeMond with a one-million dollar contract offer - the first in cycling's history - to leave <a href="Renault-Elf-Gitane" class="uri" title="wikilink">Renault-Elf-Gitane</a> at the end of 1984 and join Hinault at <a href="La_Vie_Claire" title="wikilink">La Vie Claire</a> for three years. LeMond accepted the offer and joined on a 3-year contract to first ride in support of team captain <a href="Bernard_Hinault" title="wikilink">Bernard Hinault</a>, who had regained his form and was attempting to win his fifth Tour.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Hinault led the <a href="1985_Tour_de_France" title="wikilink">1985 Tour de France</a> through the early mountain stages, but suffered a crash and began to struggle. And as Hinault faltered, LeMond realized he was capable of winning the Tour in his own right, but Tapie and <a href="La_Vie_Claire" title="wikilink">La Vie Claire</a> DS <a href=":de:Paul_K&lt;U+00F6&gt;chli" title="wikilink">Paul K&lt;U+00F6&gt;chli</a> ordered the 24-year-old LeMond to wait and ride in support of Hinault.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> So instead of pressing his advantage, LeMond let the leaders pull away and dropped back to aid Hinault, who went on to win the <a href="1985_Tour_de_France" title="wikilink">1985 Tour</a>, with LeMond in second, 1:42 behind. LeMond was clearly frustrated by the events, and later revealed that team management and K&lt;U+00F6&gt;chli had misled him as to how far back Hinault was during the crucial mountain stage.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|Quote: &quot;Yes, but they lied to me. I had about a three to four minute lead on him at that point, but I thought I only had about 45 seconds. Every time I asked them exactly how much time I had they'd evade the answer, telling me Hinault was in the group right behind me. Then when the pack of riders came up with Sean Kelly and Phil Anderson, guys who I climbed much better than, Hinault was still nowhere in sight....It was Bernard Tapie's and Paul Keochli's conspiracy to make sure Hinault won his fifth Tour.&quot;|group=N}} Regardless, LeMond rode as the dutiful lieutenant, and his support enabled Hinault to win his fifth Tour.</p>
<p><img src="Greg_Lemond_Coors_Classic.jpg" title="fig:LeMond (left) in the 1986 Coors Classic" alt="LeMond (left) in the 1986 Coors Classic" /> The following year in the <a href="1986_Tour_de_France" title="wikilink">1986 Tour</a>, LeMond was made co-leader of the <a href="La_Vie_Claire" title="wikilink">La Vie Claire</a> team alongside Hinault, with Hinault publicly promising to ride in support of LeMond to repay LeMond for the work he had done in 1985.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> What he did not say was that the help was contingent upon LeMond demonstrating that he was clearly the better rider. Hinault was in superb form, and had the chance to win an unprecedented sixth Tour. In Stage 12, the first mountain stage of the race in the Pyrenees, Hinault attacked the lead group and built up an overall lead. By the end of Stage 12, Hinault had a five-minute lead over LeMond and the other top riders. He claimed he was trying to draw out LeMond's rivals, but none of these attacks were planned with LeMond. He was clearly willing to ride aggressively and take advantage of the opportunities presented. LeMond was never in trouble, except by his own teammate. The following day Hinault broke away again early but was caught and then dropped by LeMond on the final climb of Stage 13, allowing LeMond to gain back four and a half minutes. The next three stages brought the Tour to the Alps. On Stage 17 LeMond and <a href="Urs_Zimmermann" title="wikilink">Urs Zimmermann</a> dropped Hinault from the leading group, and the end of the day saw LeMond pulling on the <a href="General_classification_in_the_Tour_de_France" title="wikilink">yellow jersey</a> of race leader, the first time it had ever been worn by a rider from the United States.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The following day in the Alps saw Hinault attack again early on the first climb, but he was pulled back. Attempting an escape on the descent, he was unable to separate himself from LeMond. The two La Vie Claire team leaders continued to pull away as they ascended the next col, and maintained the gap as they reached the base of the final climb, the vaunted <a href="Alpe_d&#39;Huez" title="wikilink">Alpe d'Huez</a>. They put on a showcase of strength and form through the twenty-one switchbacks, cresting the summit together. LeMond put an arm around Hinault and gave him a smile and the stage win in a show of unity,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> but the infighting was not over. Hinault attacked again on Stage 19 and had to be brought back by teammates <a href="Andy_Hampsten" title="wikilink">Andy Hampsten</a> and <a href="Steve_Bauer" title="wikilink">Steve Bauer</a>. Commenting on the team situation prior to the final individual time trial at Stage 20, LeMond offered the following with a wry smile:</p>
<p>&quot;He's attacked me from the beginning of the Tour De France. He's never helped me once, and I don't feel confident at all with him.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>LeMond had to keep his eye on his teammate and rival throughout the race. Hinault rode aggressively and repeatedly attacked, and the division created in the La Vie Claire team was unmistakable.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> LeMond would keep the yellow jersey to the end of the race and win his first Tour, but he felt betrayed by Hinault and the La Vie Claire team leadership, declaring that &quot;[Hinault] hasn't helped me one iota.... I have no respect for him anymore.... I know I'll never be friends with him again after this race. Not the way he's treated me.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> LeMond later stated the 1986 Tour was the most difficult and stressful race of his career.</p>

<p><img src="Greg_LeMond_1988_Vuelta_a_Andalucia.jpg" title="fig:LeMond in the 1988 Vuelta a Andaluc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a" alt="LeMond in the 1988 Vuelta a Andaluc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a" /> LeMond had planned to defend his title in the <a href="1987_Tour_de_France" title="wikilink">1987 Tour de France</a> with La Vie Claire, but was unable to participate. Early that year he was riding in the <a href="Tirreno-Adriatico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tirreno-Adriatico</a>, an early spring tune-up race, when he fell, suffering a fracture to his left wrist. He returned to the United States to recover from the injury. The week before returning to Europe he elected to go turkey hunting near his family home in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada with Rodney Barber and Patrick Blades, his uncle and brother-in-law.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The camouflaged hunters were at a ranch co-owned by Louis Barber, the father of LeMond's uncle, and Bob LeMond, Greg's father.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The trio had become separated when Blades heard movement behind him, turned and fired through a bush.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The movement had come from LeMond, who was hit in his back and right side with a devastating blast of approximately 60 <a href="lead_shot" title="wikilink">No. 2-sized pellets</a>. LeMond's injuries were near fatal. Fortunately a police helicopter was available nearby, and was used to make a fifteen minute life-flight to the Medical Center at University of California-Davis. LeMond was taken for emergency surgery. He had suffered a <a href="pneumothorax" class="uri" title="wikilink">pneumothorax</a> to his right lung and extensive bleeding, having lost some 65% of his blood volume.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The operation saved his life, but four months later he developed a small bowel obstruction due to adhesions that had formed following the shooting.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> He underwent another surgery to relieve the obstruction and take down the adhesions. Concerned that his team would drop him if they knew the shooting accident required a second surgery, LeMond asked the surgeons to remove his appendix at the same time. He subsequently informed his team that he had had his appendix removed, but the rest of the story was left somewhat vague.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The events effectively ended his 1987 season, and in October he announced he would return to serious competition the following February, with the Dutch <a href="PDM_(cycling_team)" title="wikilink">PDM</a> team.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>With 35 shotgun pellets still in his body, including three in the lining of his heart and five more embedded in his liver,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> LeMond attempted to return to racing in 1988. But his comeback was hampered by over-training, and he developed tendonitis in his right shin that required surgery. He missed the <a href="1988_Tour_de_France" title="wikilink">Tour</a> for the second year running, and relations with <a href="PDM_(cycling_team)" title="wikilink">PDM</a> soured.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Said LeMond:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They had lost total confidence in me. They were trying to claim that maybe my liver was bad, my lung was shot up, maybe I had lead poisoning. That's why I wasn't riding well. They said, 'Maybe you're not going to ever come back.'<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In response to the falling-out with PDM, LeMond moved to ADR, a team based in Belgium and co-sponsored by Coors Light for American races,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> in a deal that was completed on New Year's Eve, just hours before he would have been legally obligated to ride another season for the Dutch team. According to veteran Tour correspondent <a href="Samuel_Abt" title="wikilink">Samuel Abt</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dutch team did not want him back and his market value was low, because he had not won a race since he was wounded by shotgun pellets in a hunting accident in April 1987, almost a year after he became the first American to win the Tour de France.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joining the Belgian ADR squad allowed LeMond to continue to compete, but with teammates like <a href="Johan_Museeuw" title="wikilink">Johan Museeuw</a> who were better suited to riding Classics than Grand Tours.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p>After his storybook 1989-season, LeMond parlayed his success into the richest contract in the sport's history, signing a $5.5 million deal for three years with <a href="Cr&lt;U+00E9&gt;dit_Agricole_(cycling_team)" title="wikilink">Z-Tomasso</a> of France.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> He entered the <a href="1990_Tour_de_France" title="wikilink">1990 Tour de France</a> as defending champion and a pre-race favorite after leaving ADR to join the much stronger <a href="Cr&lt;U+00E9&gt;dit_Agricole_(cycling_team)" title="wikilink">Z-Tomasso</a> team. At &quot;Z&quot; his team mates included <a href="Robert_Millar" title="wikilink">Robert Millar</a>, <a href="Eric_Boyer" title="wikilink">Eric Boyer</a> and <a href="Ronan_Pensec" title="wikilink">Ronan Pensec</a>, all of whom already had finishes in the top six of the Tour de France.

<p>The squad's tactical plan was upset on the first day, when a breakaway that included LeMond's teammate Ronan Pensec, but no major favorites, arrived ten minutes ahead of the field.

LeMond had the distinction of winning the 1990 Tour without taking victory in a single individual stage. The perceived strength of the Z team was vindicated when they led the team classification for most of the race winning this to add to LeMond's yellow jersey.</p>
<p>In September, LeMond attempted to defend his title at the <a href="1990_UCI_Road_World_Championships" title="wikilink">1990 UCI Road World Championships</a>, but instead finished fourth, eight seconds behind the winner, his former teammate <a href="Rudy_Dhaenens" title="wikilink">Rudy Dhaenens</a> of Belgium.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>

He was the defending champion, trained well and had a solid team to support him. LeMond was among the leaders going into the Stage 8 <a href="individual_time_trial" title="wikilink">individual time trial</a>, and he finished second to the Spaniard <a href="Miguel_Indurain" title="wikilink">Miguel Indurain</a>.

<p>In 1992, LeMond won the <a href="Tour_DuPont" title="wikilink">Tour DuPont</a>, but it would be the last major win of his career.

<p>LeMond did extensive endurance training on the road that winter, but his performances the following spring failed to improve.

<p>The following year LeMond began the <a href="1994_Tour_de_France" title="wikilink">1994 Tour de France</a> but found he was unable to race effectively. He had to abandon after the first week before the race had reached the difficult mountain stages. That December he announced his retirement. The reasons for LeMond's difficulties in his later career are not entirely known. At the time of his retirement he cited <a href="mitochondrial_myopathy" title="wikilink">mitochondrial myopathy</a>{{#tag:ref|Mitochondrial myopathy is a rare condition in which the body&lt;U+2019&gt;s cellular energy system breaks down.|group=N}} as the cause of his inability to perform.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> However in 2007 LeMond speculated that he might not have the condition afterall, but rather was victim to lead <a href="Lead_poisoning" title="wikilink">toxicity</a> from the shotgun pellets still embedded in his body, the effects of which were increased by <a href="overtraining" class="uri" title="wikilink">overtraining</a>.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>LeMond acknowledged that the increasing prevalence of <a href="Use_of_performance-enhancing_drugs_in_sport" title="wikilink">doping</a> might have contributed to his own lack of competitiveness. Said LeMond: &quot;Something had changed in cycling. The speeds were faster and riders that I had easily out performed were now dropping me.

I was out because of an accident during the two prime years of my career, '87 and '88, which were two of the easiest years to win the Tour in that period. I mean if you're in the thick of racing, you understand the hierarchy. During those two years, Hinault was out, Fignon was out. Put it this way, in '89 and '90 I only feel like I raced to 90 to 95 percent of my potential. In '86 I was much stronger, climbed much faster, much better time-trialist. When we would do the time-trials, Hinault and I would finish two to three minutes up on most people. And you have to remember that in cycling, every year you make minute improvements.

<p>In 1990, LeMond founded <a href="LeMond_Racing_Cycles" title="wikilink">LeMond Bicycles</a> to develop machines for himself that would also be marketed and sold to the public. The following year, searching for an equipment edge for Team Z at the <a href="1991_Tour_de_France" title="wikilink">1991 Tour de France</a>, LeMond concluded an exclusive licensing agreement between his company and <a href="Calfee_Design" title="wikilink">Carbonframes, Inc.</a>, to access the latter's advanced composites technology.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> While LeMond briefly led the 1991 Tour overall, riding his Carbonframes-produced &quot;Greg LeMond&quot; bicycle, the company eventually faltered, something LeMond blamed on &quot;under-capitalization&quot; and poor management by his father.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Carbonframes and LeMond Cycles &quot;parted amiably two years later.&quot;<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> In 1995, with his company allegedly nearly-bankrupt, LeMond reached a licensing-agreement with <a href="Trek_Bicycle_Corporation" title="wikilink">Trek Bicycle Corporation</a>, according to which the Wisconsin-based company would manufacture and distribute bicycles designed with LeMond that would be sold under the &quot;LeMond Bicycles&quot; brand.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> LeMond would later claim that going into business with Trek &quot;destroyed&quot; his relationship with his father.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> The lucrative partnership, which generated revenue for Trek in excess of $100,000,000USD, would be renewed several times over the course of 13 years, but it ultimately ended in acrimony after LeMond's relationship with Trek deteriorated over his staunch anti-doping advocacy.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>

The Credit Suisse loan was based on a $1.16 billion <a href="Cushman_&amp;_Wakefield" title="wikilink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield</a> valuation of the resort, for which LeMond and partners each sought $11.6 million for their one-percent shares.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> In 2007 LeMond settled his suit with the Blixseths for $39 million;<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> however, he and his partners remained creditors as the Blixseths defaulted on a $20 million payment, followed by their divorce and the bankruptcy of the Club in 2009.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>

<p>LeMond became a <a href="restaurateur" class="uri" title="wikilink">restaurateur</a> in August 1990, when, in partnership with his wife and her parents, he opened <em>Scott Kee's Tour de France</em> on France Avenue in the Minneapolis suburb of <a href="Edina,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Edina, Minnesota</a>.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a><a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> LeMond described the restaurant, which was named for its chef (LeMond's brother-in-law), as &quot;a dream of five years come true.&quot; Explaining the origin of the concept, LeMond said, &quot;Kathy and I have eaten at the finest establishments in France, Italy and Belgium. Our favorites have always been small places, family-owned.&quot;<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Greg-LeMond-2009_(4).jpg" title="fig:LeMond addresses the Play the Game 2009 conference" alt="LeMond addresses the Play the Game 2009 conference" /> LeMond is a longtime anti-doping advocate and a vocal opponent of <a href="doping_(sport)" title="wikilink">performance-enhancing drug use</a>. He first spoke on-record against doping in cycling after winning the <a href="1989_Tour_de_France" title="wikilink">1989 Tour de France</a><a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a>, but LeMond attracted more substantial attention in 2001 when he publicly expressed doubts about the legitimacy of <a href="Lance_Armstrong" title="wikilink">Lance Armstrong's</a> success after learning of his relationship with <a href="Michele_Ferrari" title="wikilink">Dr. Michele Ferrari</a>.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a><a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a><a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> The intense criticism LeMond was subjected to for his comments placed him at the center of an anti-doping controversy.</p>
<p>LeMond has consistently questioned the relationship between riders and unethical sports doctors like Ferrari,<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> and has pointed out that the professional cyclists who make use of doping products are ultimately victimized by the process, likening their treatment to that of &quot;lab rats.&quot; Said LeMond: &quot;The doctors, the management, the officials, they're the ones that have corrupted riders. The riders are the only ones that pay the price.&quot; LeMond's most contentious or notable conflicts have been with fellow <a href="Tour_de_France" title="wikilink">Tour</a> riders <a href="Greg_Lemond_anti-doping_stance_and_controversies#Lance_Armstrong_and_Trek" title="wikilink">Lance Armstrong</a>, <a href="Greg_Lemond_anti-doping_stance_and_controversies#Floyd_Landis" title="wikilink">Floyd Landis</a> and <a href="Greg_Lemond_anti-doping_stance_and_controversies#Alberto_Contador" title="wikilink">Alberto Contador</a>.</p>
<p>LeMond has also been <a href="Greg_LeMond#UCI_and_Pat_McQuaid" title="wikilink">directly critical</a> of the <a href="Union_Cycliste_Internationale" title="wikilink">Union Cycliste Internationale</a> and its president, <a href="Pat_McQuaid" title="wikilink">Pat McQuaid</a>. In December 2012, LeMond claimed that a change needed to be made at the head of leadership for the UCI, and stated if called upon he would be willing to take the position himself if necessary to lead cycling out of the mire of doping. Said LeMond:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is now or never to act. After the earthquake caused by the <a href="Lance_Armstrong#USADA_Investigation_2011-2012" title="wikilink">Armstrong case</a>, another chance will not arise. I am willing to invest to make this institution more democratic, transparent and look for the best candidate in the longer term.&quot;<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>LeMond was one of the first prominent professional cyclists to openly decry the sport's descent into the corruption of doping.</p>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal life</h2>
<p>LeMond attended Wooster High School in Reno, NV. His parents are Bob LeMond and Bertha (d. 2006), and he has two sisters, Kathy and Karen. Greg is married to Kathy Morris, and together they have three children &lt;U+2013&gt; two sons (Geoffrey and Scott) and a daughter (Simone).<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> LeMond and his wife live in <a href="Medina,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Medina, Minnesota</a>. Since his retirement, LeMond has become increasingly involved in philanthropic efforts relating to causes that have affected him personally (including ADHD and sexual abuse),<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> and he and Kathy both sit on the board of the non-profit 1in6.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a><a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a><a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a></p>
<p>LeMond is an avid <a href="outdoor_enthusiast" title="wikilink">outdoor enthusiast</a> and <a href="fly_fishing" title="wikilink">fly angler</a>,<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a><a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> and in 1991 &lt;U+2013&gt; while still racing full-time &lt;U+2013&gt; he made the world-record <a href="fly_fishing" title="wikilink">fly fishing</a> catch of a four-pound <a href="smallmouth_bass" title="wikilink">smallmouth bass</a> on a reel with a four-pound <a href="Fly_fishing_tackle#Tippets" title="wikilink">tippet</a>. The record was certified by the National Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame in Hayward, Wisconsin. The catch exceeded the then-previous record of three pounds, six ounces made on the same size tippet back in 1986.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> LeMond confessed, &quot;I always pack my fly fishing equipment when I travel to bike events. I fish every chance I get.&quot;<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
<p>After retiring from pro cycling, LeMond competed in <a href="Formula_Ford_2000" title="wikilink">Formula Ford 2000</a> series <a href="auto_racing" title="wikilink">auto racing</a>.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a><a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> He is also a <a href="motivational_speaker" title="wikilink">motivational speaker</a> and was the guest speaker for Sumitomo Drive Technologies' International Sales Meeting in Cancun, Mexico on May 2, 2008. LeMond narrated an award-winning documentary for <a href="Adventures_for_the_Cure" title="wikilink">Adventures for the Cure</a> that same year.</p>
<p>On July 16, 2007, LeMond rode the <a href="L&#39;&lt;U+00C9&gt;tape_du_Tour" title="wikilink">L'&lt;U+00C9&gt;tape du Tour</a> <a href="cyclosportive" class="uri" title="wikilink">cyclosportive</a> with his son, and found it to be a defining moment in his post-competition life. &quot;I had the time of my life&quot;, he said, despite getting &quot;650th place&quot; and being &quot;impressed that I even finished&quot;. LeMond continued, &quot;I decided that day that nobody's going to keep me from cycling, not <a href="Trek_Bicycle_Corporation" title="wikilink">Trek</a>, not <a href="Lance_Armstrong" title="wikilink">Armstrong</a>, not <a href="Hein_Verbruggen" title="wikilink">Verbruggen</a>, not anybody.&quot;<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> At the time, LeMond was alluding to a series of public and private disputes related to his anti-doping advocacy that hampered his enjoyment of cycling. Especially significant was LeMond's appearance as a USADA witness in the <a href="Floyd_Landis_doping_case" title="wikilink">Floyd Landis doping case</a>. There, on the eve of LeMond's testimony in May 2007, Landis' business manager called LeMond and threatened to disclose that he was a victim of childhood sexual abuse should LeMond appear in court as scheduled.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> Undeterred, LeMond took the stand the following day, testified, and also admitted to the world that he had been molested.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>
<p>Several weeks later, LeMond and his wife Kathy gave an extensive interview to <a href="Paul_Kimmage" title="wikilink">Paul Kimmage</a> of <em><a href="The_Sunday_Times" title="wikilink">The Sunday Times</a></em>. LeMond provided additional details concerning the circumstances of his 2001 apology to Armstrong, stating that <a href="Trek_Bicycle_Corporation" title="wikilink">Trek</a>, the longtime manufacturer and distributor of LeMond Racing Cycles, had threatened to end the relationship at the behest of Armstrong. He described the two years following the forced apology as the worst in his life, marked by self-destructive behavior that ultimately led him to disclose his sexual abuse to his wife and seek help. LeMond also described how being a victim of molestation had impacted both his racing career and his life since.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>

<p>In September 2007, Greg LeMond became a founding board member of the non-profit organization 1in6.org, whose mission is &quot;to help men who have had unwanted or abusive sexual experiences in childhood live healthy, happy lives&quot;.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></p>
