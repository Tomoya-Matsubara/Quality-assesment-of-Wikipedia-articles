<p><strong>Suttle Lake</strong> is a natural lake near the crest of the <a href="Cascade_Range" title="wikilink">Cascade Range</a> in central <a href="Oregon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oregon</a>, <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, covering . It was named in honor of John Settle, whose name was misspelled when officially recorded as a geographic feature. Today, the lake is located within the <a href="Deschutes_National_Forest" title="wikilink">Deschutes National Forest</a> and serves as one of central Oregon's most popular outdoor recreation sites, with three large campgrounds and two day-use areas along the south shore of the lake. The <a href="Oregon_Department_of_Fish_and_Wildlife" title="wikilink">Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife</a> regularly stocks the lake with <a href="rainbow_trout" title="wikilink">rainbow trout</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native Americans</a> occupied the areas around Suttle Lake for perhaps 10,000 years before the first European pioneer found the lake and recorded its location. For centuries, Native Americans used trails over <a href="Santiam_Pass" title="wikilink">Santiam Pass</a> to transit from the <a href="Willamette_Valley" title="wikilink">Willamette Valley</a> to central Oregon. Suttle Lake offered a place to camp, fish, and gather berries just east of the summit.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Suttle Lake was named in honor of John Settle, an American pioneer who settled in the <a href="Lebanon,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Lebanon</a> area of the Willamette Valley. Settle was an organizer and one of the principal investors in the <a href="Santiam_Wagon_Road" title="wikilink">Willamette Valley and Cascade Mountain Military Wagon Road</a>, which was built in the mid-1860s, and also supervised some of the road construction. Settle found the lake that now bears his name in 1866 while on a hunting trip. While the lake is named for him, his last name was misspelled as &quot;Suttle&quot; when it was officially recorded.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Suttle Lake became part of the <a href="Cascade_Range_Forest_Reserve" title="wikilink">Cascade Range Forest Reserve</a> in 1898. The lake was managed as part of the reserve and then the <a href="Cascade_National_Forest" title="wikilink">Cascade National Forest</a> until 1908, when the area was transferred to the newly formed Deschutes National Forest.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1920s, the <a href="United_States_Forest_Service" title="wikilink">United States Forest Service</a> allowed some development at the lake, issuing special use permits for a church-sponsored summer camp, a lodge, and some small cabins. The Forest Service also built three public campgrounds along the lake shore. Today, Suttle Lake and the surrounding forest are part of the Sisters Ranger District, an administrative sub-division of the Deschutes National Forest. The lake's fishery is managed by the <a href="Oregon_Department_of_Fish_and_Wildlife" title="wikilink">Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="watershed">Watershed</h2>
<p>Suttle Lake is located on the east side of the Cascade Range in central Oregon,  east of <a href="Santiam_Pass" title="wikilink">Santiam Pass</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Most of the lake water comes from groundwater seepage. Link Creek is the only year around tributary flowing into the lake. It drains into the west end of the lake, with water from <a href="Blue_Lake_Crater" title="wikilink">Blue Lake</a>. The lake's only outlet is Lake Creek, which begins at the east end of the lake, eventually flowing into the <a href="Metolius_River" title="wikilink">Metolius River</a> near <a href="Camp_Sherman,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Camp Sherman, Oregon</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The watershed that drains into Suttle Lake covers . The watershed is covered by a mixed <a href="conifer" class="uri" title="wikilink">conifer</a> forest that receives an average of  to  of <a href="Precipitation_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">precipitation</a> annually. The primary tree species in the watershed are <a href="ponderosa_pine" title="wikilink">ponderosa pine</a>, <a href="lodgepole_pine" title="wikilink">lodgepole pine</a>, and <a href="jack_pine" title="wikilink">jack pine</a> along with <a href="Douglas-fir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Douglas-fir</a> and other fir species. As a result, the watershed is normally covered by a dense forest canopy. However, a <a href="Spruce_Budworm#Western_Spruce_Budworm" title="wikilink">Western Spruce Budworm</a> infestation reached epidemic levels in 1993, defoliating large areas of the Suttle Lake watershed. In 2003, the forest around the lake was burned by the <a href="B&amp;B_Complex_Fires" title="wikilink">B&amp;B Complex Fires</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>
<p>Suttle Lake is the result of glaciation during the <a href="Pleistocene_Epoch" title="wikilink">Pleistocene Epoch</a>, when the Cascade Mountains were buried in ice. A glacier carved out a deep valley leaving a lateral <a href="moraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">moraine</a> where it stopped. Over time, the moraine trapped water creating the lake. Today, Suttle Lake occupies a long, narrow valley with relatively steep slopes to the north and south.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Suttle Lake is a natural lake that covers . It is approximately  long and  wide. The lake has an average depth of  with a maximum depth of . The lake's bottom is composed of sand, gravel and rock with detritus and sediment in some of the deeper areas. The littoral areas near the shore line are mostly gravel and rock.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Under natural conditions Suttle Lake would probably be classified <a href="Mesotrophic_lake" title="wikilink">mesotrophic</a>. However, the lake's current <a href="trophic_state_index" title="wikilink">trophic state</a> is <a href="eutrophic" class="uri" title="wikilink">eutrophic</a>. During the area's long winter season, the lake may return to a mesotrophic condition. The water chemistry is normal except for a relatively high concentration of <a href="phosphorus" class="uri" title="wikilink">phosphorus</a> that promotes the growth of <a href="planktonic_algae" title="wikilink">planktonic algae</a>. There is aquatic plant life found along the periphery of the lake in a narrow zone down to a depth of about . However, most of the lake is too deep for <a href="macrophyte" class="uri" title="wikilink">macrophyte</a> growth.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>There have been a number of studies looking at the lake's environment and water quality. The studies have found the water transparency is reasonably good, but has slowly declined in recent decades due to recreational activities in the area. In 1940, researchers measured a <a href="Secchi_disk" title="wikilink">Secchi disk</a> depth of . Studies in the early 1970s found Secchi clarity ranging from  to . In 1982, another Secchi measurement showed clarity had improved to .<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="ecology">Ecology</h2>
<p>The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife manages the Suttle Lake fishery. The lake's fish population includes rainbow trout, <a href="brown_trout" title="wikilink">brown trout</a>, <a href="Kokanee_salmon#Kokanee" title="wikilink">kokanee salmon</a>, and <a href="mountain_whitefish" title="wikilink">mountain whitefish</a>. Much of the population is self-sustaining. However, the Department of Fish and Wildlife regularly stocks the lake with rainbow trout to maintain a balance of fish populations. The brown trout and kokanee salmon are particularly sought after by anglers. The lake's brown trout can weigh up to . Brown trout weighing  to  are relatively common. The kokanee salmon average  to . The mountain whitefish average  to .<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to fish, the lake provides habitat for a wide variety of bird species. From the Forest Service campgrounds along the lake shore birdwatchers can see <a href="waterfowl" class="uri" title="wikilink">waterfowl</a>, <a href="songbird" title="wikilink">songbirds</a>, and <a href="birds_of_prey" title="wikilink">birds of prey</a>. Common waterfowl include <a href="red-necked_grebe" title="wikilink">red-necked grebes</a>, <a href="Pacific_Loon" title="wikilink">Pacific loons</a>, <a href="common_loon" title="wikilink">common loons</a>, <a href="hooded_merganser" title="wikilink">hooded mergansers</a>, <a href="red-breasted_merganser" title="wikilink">red-breasted mergansers</a>, <a href="lesser_scaup" title="wikilink">lesser scaup</a>, <a href="surf_scoter" title="wikilink">surf scoters</a>, <a href="white-winged_scoter" title="wikilink">white-winged scoters</a>, <a href="common_goldeneye" title="wikilink">common goldeneye</a>, and <a href="Barrow&#39;s_goldeneye" title="wikilink">Barrow's goldeneye</a>.

<p>Over the years, a series of lodges were built at the lake. The first lodge was constructed in the early 1920s. The second was built in 1931, and a third in 1941. All three lodges were destroyed by fires. The 1941 lodge was renovated in 1974; however, before the remodeled facility re-opened a fire burned the building to the ground. The current lodge, known as The Lodge at Suttle Lake, is located at the east end of the lake, just north of the Lake Creek outlet. It is a  resort facility built in the <a href="National_Park_Service_Rustic" title="wikilink">Cascadian rustic</a> style. The lodge has ten guest rooms with fireplaces and lake or forest views. The resort also has six cabins including one that was once a Forest Service guard station.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>The first summer camp at Suttle Lake was opened in 1921. By the 1940s, the camp was hosting as many as 300 people. To accommodate the campers, Pioneer Lodge was built in 1947. The lodge was located at the east end of the lake south of the Lake Creek outlet. The facility included a large <a href="dining_hall" title="wikilink">dining hall</a>, meeting rooms, and <a href="dormitory" class="uri" title="wikilink">dormitory</a> space. Twenty cabins were also built at the site. Wesley Meadow Lodge was built in 1981 and a residence for the camp director was added in 1991. Today, Suttle Lake Camp operates year-around, offering 30 <a href="Christian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christian</a> education programs.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
