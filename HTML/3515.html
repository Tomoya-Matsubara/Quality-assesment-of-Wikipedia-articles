<p><strong><em>The Swimming Hole</em></strong> (also known as <strong><em>Swimming</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Old Swimming Hole</em></strong>) is an 1884&lt;U+2013&gt;85 painting by the American artist <a href="Thomas_Eakins" title="wikilink">Thomas Eakins</a> (1844&lt;U+2013&gt;1916), in the collection of the <a href="Amon_Carter_Museum" title="wikilink">Amon Carter Museum</a> in <a href="Fort_Worth,_Texas" title="wikilink">Fort Worth, Texas</a>. Executed in <a href="oil_on_canvas" title="wikilink">oil on canvas</a>, it depicts six men <a href="skinny_dipping" title="wikilink">swimming naked</a> in a pristine lake. <em>The Swimming Hole</em> is regarded as a masterpiece of American painting.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> According to art historian Doreen Bolger it is &quot;perhaps Eakins's most accomplished rendition of the nude figure&quot;,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and has been called &quot;the most finely designed of all his outdoor pictures&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Since the <a href="Renaissance" class="uri" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a>, the human body has been considered the most challenging subject to depict in art,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and <a href="Figure_drawing" title="wikilink">the nude</a> was the centerpiece of Eakins' teaching program at the <a href="Pennsylvania_Academy_of_the_Fine_Arts" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> For Eakins, this picture was an opportunity to display his mastery of the human form.</p>
<p>In this work, Eakins took advantage of an exception to the generally prudish <a href="Victorian_morality" title="wikilink">Victorian</a> attitude to <a href="nudity" class="uri" title="wikilink">nudity</a>: swimming naked was widely accepted,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and for males was seen as normal, even in public spaces. Eakins was the first American artist to portray one of the few occasions in 19th century life when <a href="Depictions_of_nudity" title="wikilink">nudity was on display</a>. <em>The Swimming Hole</em> develops themes raised in his earlier work, in particular his treatment of <a href="buttocks" class="uri" title="wikilink">buttocks</a> and his ambiguous treatment of the human form; in some cases it is uncertain as to whether the forms portrayed are male or female. Such themes had earlier been examined in his <em><a href="The_Gross_Clinic" title="wikilink">The Gross Clinic</a></em> (1875) and <em><a href=":File:William_rush_carving_his_allegorical_figur_of_schuylkill_river_thomas_eakins.jpeg" title="wikilink">William Rush</a></em> (1877), and would continue to be explored in his paintings of boxers and wrestlers.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

The title <em>The Swimming Hole</em> dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Four years later, she titled the work <em>The Old Swimming Hole</em>, in reference to the 1882 poem ''The Old Swimmin'-Hole'; by <a href="James_Whitcomb_Riley" title="wikilink">James Whitcomb Riley</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The <a href="Amon_Carter_Museum" title="wikilink">Amon Carter Museum</a> has since returned to Eakins' original title, <em>Swimming</em>. <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

They are (from left to right): <a href="Talcott_Williams" title="wikilink">Talcott Williams</a> (1849&lt;U+2013&gt;1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 &lt;U+2013&gt; c. 1900), John Laurie Wallace (1864&lt;U+2013&gt;1953), Jesse Godley (1862&lt;U+2013&gt;89), Harry the dog (Eakins' <a href="Irish_Setter" title="wikilink">Irish Setter</a>, c. 1880&lt;U+2013&gt;90), George Reynolds (c. 1839&lt;U+2013&gt;89), and Eakins himself.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873.

Eakins may have seen this painting while studying in Paris." /> The composition is pyramidal. The figure reclining at left leads the viewer's eye to the seated figure, whose gesture in turn points to Godley at the apex of the compositional pyramid. The diving figure at right leads to the swimming form of Eakins, who painted himself into the scene and whose leftward movement directs attention back into the painting.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Eakins enforces this pyramidal structure by manipulating the <a href="Focus_(optics)" title="wikilink">focus</a> of the painting: the center area containing the swimmers is extremely precise, while the outer areas are diffuse, with &quot;virtually no moderating zones in between&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The lighting within the picture is unnatural—too bright in some places, and too dark in others—although the effect, which tends to accentuate the body lines of the swimmers, is generally subtle.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The composition is notable for both its adherence to academic tradition (the mastery of the figure as an end in itself), and its uniqueness in transposing the male nude to an outdoor setting. The depiction of someone diving into water was nearly unprecedented in the history of Western art.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The other figures are artfully arranged to imply a continuous narrative of movement, the poses progressing &quot;from reclining to sitting to standing to diving&quot;; at the same time, each figure is carefully positioned so that no genitalia are visible.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> As in his previous works, Eakins chose to include a <a href="self-portrait" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-portrait</a>, here as the swimmer at bottom-right. Unlike his appearances in <em>The Gross Clinic</em> or <em><a href="Max_Schmitt_in_a_Single_Scull" title="wikilink">Max Schmitt in a Single Scull</a></em>, here the artist's presence is more ambiguous&lt;U+2014&gt;he may be seen as companion, teacher, or voyeur.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The ripple in the water next to Eakins, and the bubbles around the diver, are the only indications of movement in a painting where motion is otherwise arrested;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> the water next to the red-headed figure in the lake is still enough to offer a clear reflection.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> This contrast underscores the tension in the picture between classical prototypes and scientific naturalism.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of <a href="Greek_art" title="wikilink">Greek art</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The reclining figure is a paraphrasing of the <em><a href="Dying_Gaul" title="wikilink">Dying Gaul</a></em>, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> One possible influence by a contemporary source was <em>Summer Scene</em>, painted in 1869 by <a href="Fr&lt;U+00E9&gt;d&lt;U+00E9&gt;ric_Bazille" title="wikilink">Fr&lt;U+00E9&gt;d&lt;U+00E9&gt;ric Bazille</a> (1841&lt;U+2013&gt;70).

<p>In Eakins' <a href="Work_of_art#Oeuvre" title="wikilink">oeuvre</a>, <em>The Swimming Hole</em> was immediately preceded by a number of similar works on the <a href="Arcadia_(utopia)" title="wikilink">Arcadian</a> theme.

<h2 id="studies">Studies</h2>
<p>Eakins made several on-site <a href="oil_sketch" title="wikilink">oil sketches</a> and photographic studies before painting <em>The Swimming Hole</em>. It is unknown whether the photographs were taken before the oil sketches were produced or vice versa (or, indeed, whether they were created on the same day).</p>
<p>By the early 1880s, Eakins was using photography to explore sequential movement and as a reference for painting.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Some time in 1883 or 1884, he photographed his students engaged in outdoor activities.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Four photographs of his students swimming naked in Dove Lake have survived, and bear a clear relationship to <em>The Swimming Hole</em>. The swimmers are seen in the same spot and from the same vantage point, although their positions are entirely different from those in the painting. None of the photographs closely matches the poses depicted in the painting; this was unusual for Eakins, who typically adhered closely to his photographic studies. &quot;The divergence between these sets of images may hint at lost or destroyed pictures, or it may tell us that the photographs came first, before Eakins' mental image had crystallized, and before the execution of his first oil sketch.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The poses in the photographs are more spontaneous, while those of the painting are deliberately composed with a classical &quot;severity&quot;.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Although no photographic studies have survived that would suggest a more direct connection between the photographs and the painting, recent scholarship has proposed that marks incised onto the canvas and later covered by paint indicate that Eakins made use of light-projected photographs.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>Eakins combined his studies into a final oil sketch in 1884, which became the basis for the finished painting. The basic composition remained unchanged, as all six men and the dog appeared in the sketch; however, Eakins, who usually adhered closely to his sketches when developing a final work, made several uncharacteristic alterations to the specific movements and positions of the figures.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> A friend and student, Charles Bregler, described the process:</p>
<h2 id="commission-and-reception">Commission and reception</h2>
<p>The painting was commissioned in 1884 by Edward Hornor Coates, a Philadelphia businessman who chaired the Committee on Instruction at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where Eakins taught. Coates intended to pay Eakins $800, which at the time was the largest commission Eakins had been offered.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Coates intended the painting for an exhibition at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and it was shown at the Academy's exhibition in the fall of 1885. However, Coates rejected it as unrepresentative of Eakins' oeuvre.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> In a November 27, 1885 letter to Eakins, Coates reasoned,  <a href="image:Edward_Horner_Coates.jpg" title="wikilink">left|thumb|upright|<a href="Robert_Vonnoh" title="wikilink">Robert Vonnoh</a>, <em>Edward Hornor Coates</em> (1846&lt;U+2013&gt;1921), 1893, oil on canvas, 50&lt;U+215B&gt; &lt;U+00D7&gt; 40&lt;U+215B&gt; in (128 &lt;U+00D7&gt; 103 cm)</a> It is not known precisely why Coates failed to purchase the painting; however, it seems likely that Coates felt the work was too controversial to acquire.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Coates, as Head of Instruction at Eakins' academy, would have been familiar with the subject matter of Eakins' works, and thus it seems unlikely that the nudity in the painting would have surprised or shocked him.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Rather, it seems certain that Coates would have recognized the majority of men in the painting, as all but one were students of Eakins at the academy. He was undoubtedly familiar with the site depicted in the painting too, as it was only a half a mile (800 m) from <a href="Haverford_College" title="wikilink">Haverford College</a>, where Coates studied as an undergraduate.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> The depiction of a professor and his students together in the nude would have been a sensitive subject for the academy's directors, who had forbidden Eakins from using Academy students as models, as modeling was considered indecent.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Coates chose to exchange <em>The Swimming Hole</em> for the &quot;less controversial genre scene&quot; of Eakins' <em>The Pathetic Song</em>—today housed in the <a href="Corcoran_Gallery_of_Art" title="wikilink">Corcoran Gallery of Art</a>—<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> and paid Eakins the $800 he had offered for the original commission.</p>
<p>On February 9, 1886, Eakins was forced to resign from the Academy due to his removal of a loincloth from a male model in a class where female students were present. In a letter to Coates on February 15 in which Eakins explained his reasons for resigning, he addressed the issue of nudity in his artwork:  </p>

<p><a href="image:Thomas_Eakins_circa_1882_cropped.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|Thomas Eakins, c. 1882</a> Following its rejection by Coates, the painting remained in Eakins' possession until his death. It was exhibited just twice more during Eakins' lifetime: at the 1886 Southern Exposition in <a href="Louisville,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Louisville, Kentucky</a>, and in 1887 at Chicago's Inter-State Industrial Exposition, and ignored by critics on both occasions. The painting then disappears from the historical record—there is no further reference to the painting in any records from Eakins or his circle of friends during Eakins' lifetime.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Following Eakins' death, the painting was exhibited in Philadelphia and New York at memorial exhibitions in 1917.</p>
<p>In 1925, <em>The Swimming Hole</em> was purchased from the artist's widow by the community of <a href="Fort_Worth,_Texas" title="wikilink">Fort Worth, Texas</a> for $750.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Thereafter it was in the collection of the Fort Worth Art Association, the institutional predecessor of the <a href="Modern_Art_Museum_of_Fort_Worth" title="wikilink">Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth</a>, and was displayed in the city's public library. In 1990, the museum announced it intended to sell the painting to build an endowment for the purchase of contemporary art.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> A public outcry ensued, prompting the museum to search for a local buyer. Eventually, after tumultuous negotiations, the <a href="Amon_Carter_Museum" title="wikilink">Amon Carter Museum</a> agreed to purchase <em>The Swimming Hole</em> for $10 million.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="restorations">Restorations</h2>
<p>Before its purchase by the Amon Carter Museum, <em>The Swimming Hole</em> appears to have undergone seven different <a href="art_restoration" title="wikilink">conservatory treatments</a>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> It may have been restored prior to its inclusion in Eakins' memorial exhibition at the <a href="Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in 1917. A photograph from that time reveals cracks in the <a href="Glaze_(painting_technique)" title="wikilink">glazes</a> and a drip mark, possibly caused by the splash of a caustic liquid.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> After the painting was acquired by the Fort Worth Art Association, it was often lent out for exhibitions and was damaged as a result. In 1937 it was relined by a private gallery in New York City and the drip was painted out. In 1944 it was relined and restored and in 1947 it was restored again, both times by a private New York dealer.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The <a href="Brooklyn_Museum" title="wikilink">Brooklyn Museum</a> performed two minor restorations in 1954 and 1957. Although it continued to travel frequently, <em>The Swimming Hole</em> received no comprehensive treatment until 1993.</p>
<p>Following its purchase by the Amon Carter Museum, in June 1993, Claire M. Barry and staff from the Amon Carter and the <a href="Kimbell_Art_Museum" title="wikilink">Kimbell Art Museums</a> began a major restoration of the painting. According to Barry, &quot;The restoration revealed relatively little significant damage or deterioration not previously visible. Several layers of discolored varnish and overpaint were removed, exposing a rich and varied surface with brushwork ranging from the controlled, almost miniaturistic strokes forming the figures to the freer treatment of the landscape elements.&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>Much effort went into distinguishing the original glazes from those added during subsequent restorations. Previous retouches were removed and a natural resin varnish was applied. The painting's original frame, long missing, was located in 1992. It too was cleaned, restored, and reinstalled to the painting.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>During the restoration, it was discovered that a long-standing ascription of the painting's date to 1883 was the result of a misinterpretation: the artist's original inscription of 1885 was painted in a <a href="fugitive_pigments" title="wikilink">fugitive</a> red-lake pigment that had faded, and was mistakenly repainted by a conservator to the earlier date.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>
<p><em>The Swimming Hole</em> represented the full range of Eakins' techniques and academic principles. He used life study, photography, wax studies, and landscape sketches to produce a work that manifested his interest in the human form.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Lloyd Goodrich (1897&lt;U+2013&gt;1987) believed the work was &quot;Eakins's most masterful use of the nude&quot;, with the solidly conceived figures perfectly integrated into the landscape, an image of subtle tonal construction and one of the artist's &quot;richest pieces of painting&quot;.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Another biographer, <a href="William_Innes_Homer" title="wikilink">William Innes Homer</a> (b. 1929), was more reserved and described the poses of the figures as rigidly academic. Homer found inconsistencies in paint quality and atmospheric effect, and wrote that the painting was unsuccessful in reconciling antique and naturalistic ideals. For him, &quot;it is as though these nudes had been abruptly transplanted from the studio into nature&quot;.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="image:Dove_Lake_PA_7.jpg" title="wikilink">left|thumb|Present-day <a href="Dove_Lake,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Dove Lake</a></a></p>
<p>Before the mid-19th century, the subject of the male figure in Western art had long been reserved for classical subject matter. In the 19th century, it was not unusual for boys and men to swim without clothing in public, but there was no precedent for this subject in American painting.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Although there was an informal convention for multiple-figure compositions featuring female nudes, such paintings were exhibited in saloons rather than galleries; Eakins altered the gender and presented the subject as fine art.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Viewed in a broader context, <em>The Swimming Hole</em> has been cited as one of the few 19th-century American paintings that &quot;engages directly with a newly emerging European tradition&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;that of the male bather.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Eakins' picture, although not as stylistically progressive as the works of his French contemporaries, parallels the novel thematic direction taken by Bazille in <em>Summer Scene</em>, <a href="Georges-Pierre_Seurat" title="wikilink">Georges Seurat</a> (1859&lt;U+2013&gt;91) (<em><a href="Une_Baignade,_Asni&lt;U+00E8&gt;res" title="wikilink">The Bathers at Asni&lt;U+00E8&gt;res</a></em>, 1884) and <a href="Paul_C&lt;U+00E9&gt;zanne" title="wikilink">Paul C&lt;U+00E9&gt;zanne</a> (1839–1906)<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> in his numerous explorations of the subject.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>Eakins' work influenced the subsequent generation of <a href="American_realism" title="wikilink">American realists</a>, particularly the artists of the <a href="Ashcan_School" title="wikilink">Ashcan School</a>. <a href="George_Bellows" title="wikilink">George Bellows</a>' (1882–1925) <em>Forty-two Kids</em>, painted in 1907, bears obvious similarity to <em>The Swimming Hole</em>, although Bellows' painting has been interpreted as a parody of the Eakins, and the many naked children of the title are playing in the urban <a href="Hudson_River" title="wikilink">Hudson River</a> of <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> rather than in a rural setting.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> In a sentiment that reflected Eakins' philosophy, Bellows later explained his motivation for painting <em>Forty-two Kids</em>: &quot;Prizefighters and swimmers are the only types whose muscular action can be painted in the nude legitimately.&quot;<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="image:Dove_Lake_PA_4.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|Present-day view of <a href="Dove_Lake,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Dove Lake</a></a></p>
<p>Eakins' widow's retitling of the picture after his death reinforced the popular association with the nostalgic sentiment of Riley's poem,<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> and more recently, the painting's subject has been compared to the poem &quot;<a href="Song_of_Myself" title="wikilink">Song of Myself</a>&quot; by <a href="Walt_Whitman" title="wikilink">Walt Whitman</a>'s (1819–92), particularly the section &quot;<a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Leaves_of_Grass/Book_III#11">Twenty-Eight Young Men Bathe by the Shore</a>&quot;, given the shared interest in the imagery of men bathing in the nude.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Whitman may have provided inspiration: the celebration of nudity, which in Whitman's case was an open expression of his homosexuality, informs both men's art.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> In 1895, one of Eakins' male students reminisced about &quot;us Whitman fellows&quot;, which has been interpreted as a reference to homosexuality.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> &quot;But for their marital status, however, virtually nothing concrete is known of the private realms or sexual propensities of any of the men depicted (in <em>The Swimming Hole</em>), with the exception of Eakins.&quot;<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the painting has been viewed as a <a href="Platonic_love" title="wikilink">platonic</a> vision of the male nude seen unselfconsciously in a natural setting,<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> by the 1970s some American writers were beginning to see Eakins' work, and specifically <em>The Swimming Hole</em>, as having homoerotic implications.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Critics have paid particular attention to the compositional prominence of the standing figure's buttocks, which has been interpreted as suggestive of &quot;homoerotic interests&quot;.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> According to Jonathan Weinberg, <em>The Swimming Hole</em> marked the beginning of homoerotic imagery in American art.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Eakins left a record simultaneously provocative and ambiguous on matters of sex. Based on the same visual evidence, that of the photographs, oil sketches, and the finished painting of swimmers, art historians have drawn markedly varying conclusions as to the artist's intent.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
