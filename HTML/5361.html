<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Brisbane Boys' College was established in 1902 By Mr Arthur &quot;Barney&quot; Rudd. Rudd arrived in Brisbane in 1901 by boat from <a href="Melbourne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Melbourne</a> and started a school in <a href="Clayfield,_Queensland" title="wikilink">Clayfield</a> in a house called &quot;Knockarda&quot;. The school opened in February 1902 with just 4 students.</p>
<p>In 1906 the school moved to a new premises on the corner of Bayview Terrace, near the tram terminus. There was limited room for sporting fixtures, so for many years the boys walked to the nearby <a href="Kalinga_Park,_Brisbane" title="wikilink">Kalinga Park</a>. In 1908 the school had 32 students, and a cadet corps was formed with the impending <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">1914-1918 war</a>. The school suffered the losses of 8 Clayfield Collegians during the war. In the late twenties it was decided that there were insufficient facilities, and for the school was moved to its current site in <a href="Toowong,_Queensland" title="wikilink"> Toowong</a> with generous support from its owners, the daughters of the late <a href="Premier_of_Queensland" title="wikilink">Premier of Queensland</a>, Sir <a href="Robert_Philp" title="wikilink">Robert Philp</a>. The Clayfield campus became a primary school department of <a href="Somerville_House" title="wikilink">Somerville House</a>, which later developed into the independent <a href="Clayfield_College" title="wikilink">Clayfield College</a>.</p>
<h2 id="present-day">Present day</h2>
<p>BBC is owned by the <a href="Presbyterian_and_Methodist_Schools_Association" title="wikilink">Presbyterian and Methodist Schools Association</a>, which was formed in 1918 and owns other private schools in Queensland. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the College fosters belief in academic success, there are wide range of co-curricular activities offered to students from Year 1 - 12.</p>
<h2 id="campus">Campus</h2>
<p><img src="Bbcfrontentrance.JPG" title="fig:The Brisbane Boys&#39; College front entrance." alt="The Brisbane Boys&#39; College front entrance." width="180" /> BBC's campus is located in the Brisbane suburb of <a href="Toowong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toowong</a> on land bordered by Moggill Road, Kensington Terrace and Miskin Street, with the main entrance from Kensington Terrace</p>
<p>The main building dates from the 1930s when the school moved to the site and is characterised by its Mediterranean arches and clock tower. Rudd and Hamilton wings form a T extending away from the main building and the modern glass fronted library fills the semi-circle. Other buildings on the site include McKenzie wing, College Hall, Barbra Helen Thomson Sports Complex, Birtles wing and the Junior School buildings.</p>
<p>There are 4 ovals included within the BBC grounds: Main, Junior School, P&amp;F and Miskin. BBC also makes use of the Oakman Park ovals, Toowong College, <a href="University_of_Queensland" title="wikilink">University of Queensland</a> and St Lucia playing fields.</p>
<h3 id="campus-development">Campus Development</h3>
<p>The extension of the Junior School to allow the integration of Preparatory School and Grades 1 - 3 is expected to be completed by the end of 2008, but temporary classrooms/facilities have been put in place to accommodate the new students. Other developments include the refurbishment of the out-dated McKenzie wing, which is being cited as the new facility for Film, Television and New Media. To make way for the new Junior School, a series of Year 7 classrooms have replaced the old staff room, which has now been relocated to the old Manual Arts building, along with Student Services.</p>
<h2 id="uniform">Uniform</h2>
<p><img src="BBC_uniform.gif" title="fig:BBC_uniform.gif" alt="BBC_uniform.gif" /> The College uniform varies throughout the different grades, these being between years 4-6, 7-11 and 12. One defining factor of the uniform is the boater, a straw hat worn to and from the school and in public that has been a college tradition since its conception. In years 4-6 the uniform consists of a green shirt, a green and black tie, grey shorts and plain grey socks. In years 7-11 the only difference is that trousers are worn, and in year 12 a white shirt and green and white tie are worn.</p>
<p>Green, white and black striped blazers are worn in terms 2 and 3. Blazers also display &quot;Colours&quot; which are awards that warrant embroidery on the pockets of the blazer. Lines, Half-Colours and Full-Colours are displayed on the bottom right-hand, top left-hand and top right-hand pocket respectively, and each display a line of text, which display the category of achievement and the year the award was given. Half-Colours and Full-Colours also exhibit altered forms of the BBC emblem (School captains have a yellow full colour emblem). Students in leadership positions, such as house capitains and prefects, are given a badge with their name and position within the school. Prefects wear a distinguished tie and boater-band, which features Green, Black and Gold stripes.</p>

<h3 id="mascots">Mascots</h3>
<p>BBC's support for many years has been provided by the College pipeband. However, with support at GPS events radically declining the school decided that drastic action was needed, and thus the Highlander was created. This seven-foot-tall beast attends GPS sports events, and leads the school in its many war cries. He wears face paint in the colours green, white and black. He wears a kilt, and is never seen without his sword or shield, the latter of which is also painted in the school colours.</p>
<h3 id="war-cries">War cries</h3>
<p>The school has many war cries, which are used to rally support at sporting events.</p>
<p>The official college war cry is:<br />
<em>Aloomba Kaloomba by-a-duco</em><br />
<em>Winya Winya go go go</em><br />
<em>Karigal Karigal Nany-o-mar</em><br />
<em>Nurumbeta Burundarra tarra-kara-la</em><br />
<em>Go on College Green White Black</em><br />
<em>Ray Ray Ray!</em><br />

<em>our school was born may it go on</em><br />
<em>from fame to fame.</em><br />
<br />
