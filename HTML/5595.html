<p><strong>Johnson Creek</strong> is a 25-mile (40 km) long tributary of the <a href="Willamette_River" title="wikilink">Willamette River</a> in the <a href="Portland_metropolitan_area" title="wikilink">Portland metropolitan area</a> of the <a href="U.S._state" title="wikilink">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Oregon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oregon</a>. Part of the <a href="drainage_basin" title="wikilink">drainage basin</a> of the <a href="Columbia_River" title="wikilink">Columbia River</a>, its watershed consists of  of mostly urban land occupied by about 175,000 people as of 2006.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Passing through the cities of <a href="Gresham,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Gresham</a>, <a href="Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Portland</a>, and <a href="Milwaukie,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Milwaukie</a>, the creek flows generally west from the foothills of the <a href="Cascade_Range" title="wikilink">Cascade Range</a> through sediments deposited by glacial floods on a substrate of <a href="basalt" class="uri" title="wikilink">basalt</a>. Though polluted, it is free-flowing along its main stem and provides habitat for <a href="salmon" class="uri" title="wikilink">salmon</a> and other <a href="fish_migration" title="wikilink">migrating fish</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to European settlement, the watershed was heavily forested and was used by <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native Americans</a> of the <a href="Chinookan" title="wikilink">Chinook band</a> for fishing and hunting. In the 19th century, white <a href="settler" title="wikilink">settlers</a> cleared much of the land for farming, and the stream is named for one of these newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 built a water-powered <a href="sawmill" class="uri" title="wikilink">sawmill</a> along the creek. By the early 20th century, a rail line parallel to the stream encouraged further residential and commercial development. As urban density increased in the floodplain, seasonal floods grew more damaging. In the 1930s the <a href="Works_Progress_Administration" title="wikilink">Works Progress Administration</a> of the <a href="United_States_government" title="wikilink">federal government</a> lined the lower  of Johnson Creek with rock to control the floods.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Despite this, the creek flooded 37 times between 1941 and 2006.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Since the 1990s, regional planners have tried to reduce flooding by controlling <a href="stormwater" class="uri" title="wikilink">stormwater</a> <a href="surface_runoff" title="wikilink">runoff</a>, creating stream <a href="meander" title="wikilink">meanders</a>, reducing <a href="erosion" class="uri" title="wikilink">erosion</a>, replacing impervious surfaces, and protecting <a href="riparian" class="uri" title="wikilink">riparian</a> buffers.</p>
<p>The Johnson Creek watershed includes the subwatersheds of Badger Creek, Sunshine Creek, Kelley Creek, Mitchell Creek, Veterans Creek, Crystal Springs Creek, and smaller streams. Parks along the creek and its tributaries include natural areas, a wildlife refuge, a <a href="rhododendron" class="uri" title="wikilink">rhododendron</a> garden, a botanical garden, and a  bicycle and pedestrian <a href="rail_trail" title="wikilink">rail trail</a> that follows the creek for much of its length.</p>
<h2 id="course">Course</h2>
<p><img src="FootbridgeJohnsonCreek.jpg" title="fig:A footbridge crosses Johnson Creek near Regner Road in Gresham." alt="A footbridge crosses Johnson Creek near Regner Road in Gresham." />Johnson Creek begins near the unincorporated community of <a href="Cottrell,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Cottrell</a>, in <a href="Clackamas_County,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Clackamas County, Oregon</a>, southeast of <a href="Gresham,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Gresham</a> in the foothills of the <a href="Cascade_Range" title="wikilink">Cascade Range</a>, and flows generally westward about  to its confluence with the <a href="Willamette_River" title="wikilink">Willamette River</a>, a major tributary of the <a href="Columbia_River" title="wikilink">Columbia River</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The creek passes through the cities of Gresham, <a href="Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Portland</a>, and <a href="Milwaukie,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Milwaukie</a> and crosses the border between Clackamas County and <a href="Multnomah_County,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Multnomah County</a> eight times.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>For much of its course, the creek flows at almost right angles to the numbered avenues of southeast Portland and its eastern suburbs. The biggest numbers are near the headwaters, and the smallest numbers are near the mouth. The creek begins in uplands in Clackamas County east of Southeast 362nd Avenue and flows swiftly to the west for about , crisscrossing the border between Clackamas County and Multnomah County 5 times in this upstream stretch, and passing under <a href="U.S._Route_26_(Oregon)" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 26</a>, the <a href="Mount_Hood" title="wikilink">Mount Hood</a> Highway, at about <a href="river_mile" title="wikilink">river mile</a> 20 (RM 20) in Multnomah County. Shortly thereafter, it receives Badger Creek and Sunshine Creek from the left and the North Fork of Johnson Creek from the right.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Turning sharply, Johnson Creek flows swiftly northwest for about , entering Gresham at about RM 16.5 and passing the <a href="USGS" class="uri" title="wikilink">USGS</a> gauge at Regner Road at RM 16.2. At about RM 16, the creek enters Main City Park in Gresham, where it again turns sharply and flows slightly south of west for most of the rest of its course. In Gresham the slope flattens and the stream runs more slowly for the next third of its course. Slightly west of Main City Park, it passes the <a href="Gresham_Pioneer_Cemetery" title="wikilink">Gresham Pioneer Cemetery</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Just beyond the cemetery, it receives Butler Creek on the left, enters Portland at about RM 13, and receives Kelley Creek on the left shortly thereafter. Mitchell Creek is a major tributary of Kelley Creek, which it enters about  south of Johnson Creek. Shortly thereafter, Johnson Creek passes the USGS gauge station at Sycamore at RM 10.2.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Meander" title="wikilink">Meandering</a> slowly through the <a href="Lents,_Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Lents</a> neighborhood of Portland, Johnson Creek receives Veterans Creek, which enters on the left from its headwaters in <a href="Happy_Valley,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Happy Valley</a> in Clackamas County. Johnson Creek passes under <a href="Interstate_205_(Oregon-Washington)" title="wikilink">Interstate 205</a>, and shortly thereafter begins to flow more swiftly again from Southeast 82nd Avenue (RM 8) onwards. It then makes its sixth and seventh county-border crossings, dipping briefly into Clackamas County and back north into Multnomah County and then runs near the border between Portland and Milwaukie along Johnson Creek Boulevard for about . After passing under <a href="Oregon_Route_99E" title="wikilink">Oregon Route 99E</a>, also known as Southeast McLoughlin Boulevard, in the <a href="Sellwood,_Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Sellwood</a> neighborhood of Portland at about RM 1.5, the creek turns sharply south.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>At Southeast 21st Avenue, it receives Crystal Springs Creek, which enters on the right. This tributary, about  long, begins on the <a href="Reed_College" title="wikilink">Reed College</a> campus, flows under the <a href="Blue_Bridge_(Oregon)" title="wikilink">Blue Bridge</a> in Reed Canyon, through the <a href="Crystal_Springs_Rhododendron_Garden" title="wikilink">Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden</a>, and generally south to Johnson Creek. From its confluence with Crystal Springs Creek, Johnson Creek flows south about , crossing the county border for the eighth and final time. After re-entering Clackamas County, it passes the USGS gauge station at Milwaukie at RM 0.7 and empties into the Willamette River at Willamette RM 18.5 (km 30). About  below Johnson Creek, the Willamette River joins the Columbia River, which flows about another  to the Pacific Ocean at <a href="Astoria,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Astoria</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="geology-and-topography">Geology and topography</h3>
<p>The <a href="floodplain" class="uri" title="wikilink">floodplain</a> of Johnson Creek is a remnant of large glacial floods known as the <a href="Missoula_Floods" title="wikilink">Missoula Floods</a> that deposited thick <a href="sediment" title="wikilink">sediments</a> between 13,000 and 15,000 years ago in the <a href="Columbia_Basin" title="wikilink">Columbia River Basin</a>, including much of the <a href="Willamette_Valley" title="wikilink">Willamette Valley</a>. Underlying the sediments are substantial thicknesses of <a href="basalt" class="uri" title="wikilink">basalt</a> lavas from the <a href="Columbia_River_Basalt_Group" title="wikilink">Columbia River Basalt Group</a>. The lava, exposed mainly in the uplands, has been folded and <a href="Fault_(geology)" title="wikilink">faulted</a> to form a series of sub-basins, including the Johnson Creek watershed.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The watershed is a roughly rectangular area of about .<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The topography of the watershed varies greatly from the high point of about  above sea level<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> in the Boring Hills near the creek's source to the low point of  where the creek meets the Willamette River.</p>
<p>Slopes in the watershed range generally between 1 and 25 percent. Mount Scott and <a href="Powell_Butte" title="wikilink">Powell Butte</a> rise to about  and have slopes ranging from 10 to 30 percent. Gresham Butte and Hogan Butte, in Gresham, have the steepest slopes, including a few around 50 percent. The Boring Hills, of volcanic origin, rise more than  higher than the terraces to the north and west. The Kelso Slope, a northwest-sloping <a href="Dissected_plateau" title="wikilink">dissected surface</a> west of the canyon of the <a href="Sandy_River_(Oregon)" title="wikilink">Sandy River</a>, tilts down from about  above sea level near <a href="Sandy,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Sandy</a> to about  above sea level east of Gresham.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Formed by the ancestral Columbia and Willamette Rivers, the <a href="Stream_terrace" title="wikilink">terraces</a> north of Johnson Creek are generally underlain by permeable sand and gravel. Three isolated hills—<a href="Rocky_Butte" title="wikilink">Rocky Butte</a>, <a href="Mount_Tabor,_Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Mount Tabor</a>, and Kelly Butte—rise about  to  above the surrounding terraces. With the exception of Powell Butte, the terrain on the north side of Johnson Creek is less steep than on the south side of the creek, which includes Mount Scott and the <a href="Boring_Lava_Field" title="wikilink">Boring Lava Domes</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The eastern half of the watershed is more open and rural than the urban western half, which consists largely of residential areas with pockets of commerce and industry. An estimated 175,000 people lived in the watershed as of 2006.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="soils">Soils</h3>
<p>The potential for soil <a href="erosion" class="uri" title="wikilink">erosion</a> varies throughout the watershed. Erosion is not a big threat in the northwestern part of the watershed, where the land is flat and developed, or in the northeast, dominated by low-erosion soils. In the southeast, soils have a medium risk of erosion, and soils around Powell Butte and the Boring Lava Domes have &quot;an extremely high erodibility factor and are sensitive to ground disturbance&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>The watershed's soils vary in their <a href="Permeability_(earth_sciences)" title="wikilink">permeability</a> and water-retaining capacity. South of the creek and at the eastern end of the watershed they consist mostly of clays with high runoff potential. Northern areas of the watershed are generally porous, with moderate to high permeability.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="hydrology">Hydrology</h3>
<p><img src="Johnson_creek_SE_41st_weir_P.jpg" title="fig:Lower Johnson Creek rejoins itself after forming a small island near Southeast 42nd Avenue." alt="Lower Johnson Creek rejoins itself after forming a small island near Southeast 42nd Avenue." /> The watershed can be divided into two hydrologic areas with different <a href="Infiltration_(hydrology)" title="wikilink">infiltration</a> rates. The northern area, comprising about 40 percent of the watershed, consists of the Portland Terraces, and the southern consists of the Boring Hills and the Kelso Slope. Most of the rain that falls on the northern area percolates into the ground, and most of the rain that falls on the southern area runs quickly into the creek or its tributaries. Rain that falls on the north generally has a more gradual, longer-lasting effect, sustaining the <a href="Baseflow" title="wikilink">base flow</a> of the creek during dry periods.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Of the estimated 30 creek systems that existed in the watershed before 19th-century settlement, fewer than a dozen remain above-ground or free-flowing.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Generally, the tributaries begin south of the main stem and flow north; the major exception is Crystal Springs Creek, which begins as a <a href="groundwater" class="uri" title="wikilink">groundwater</a> discharge and flows south over relatively impermeable <a href="alluvial" class="uri" title="wikilink">alluvial</a> deposits to Johnson Creek at Johnson Creek Park.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The other major tributaries are Veterans Creek, Kelley Creek, Butler Creek, Sunshine Creek, and Badger Creek. Crystal Springs Creek and Kelley Creek are the largest tributaries in terms of flow contribution.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Fill_dirt" title="wikilink">Fill</a> at Foster Road and Southeast 111th Avenue usually prevents stormwater runoff from a  area of the watershed in the <a href="Lents,_Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Lents</a> and <a href="Powellhurst-Gilbert,_Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Powellhurst-Gilbert</a> neighborhoods from flowing directly into the creek. Instead, runoff is routed to <a href="sump" title="wikilink">sumps</a>, where it percolates into the ground. Normal drainage patterns have also been altered further downstream in the <a href="Sellwood,_Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Sellwood</a>, <a href="Eastmoreland,_Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Eastmoreland</a>, <a href="Westmoreland,_Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Westmoreland</a>, and <a href="Woodstock,_Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Woodstock</a> neighborhoods, where runoff flows into the Portland sewer system instead of into the creek.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="jurisdiction">Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>Six local political jurisdictions overlap with the Johnson Creek watershed. In 2000, 38 percent of the watershed was in Portland's city limits, 24 percent in unincorporated Clackamas County, 23 percent in Gresham, 11 percent in unincorporated Multnomah County, 4 percent in Milwaukie, and 0.1 percent in <a href="Happy_Valley,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Happy Valley</a>. None of the cities lies entirely within the watershed. In 2000, Johnson Creek and its tributaries drained 53 percent of Gresham, 42 percent of Milwaukie, 19 percent of Happy Valley, and 14 percent of Portland. The watershed covered only 1.2 percent of unincorporated Multnomah County and less than 1 percent of unincorporated Clackamas County.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Neighboring watersheds on the east side of the Willamette River include Mount Scott Creek and Kellogg Creek, which flow through Milwaukie and drain directly into the Willamette; the Clackamas River, which drains the southeast suburbs and empties into the Willamette near <a href="Oregon_City" title="wikilink">Oregon City</a>; the <a href="Sandy_River_(Oregon)" title="wikilink">Sandy River</a>, which drains the eastern suburbs and empties into the Columbia; and Fairview Creek and the Columbia Slough, which drain north Portland and Gresham, emptying into the Columbia.</p>
<p>Watersheds on the west side of the Willamette within Portland's jurisdiction include <a href="Fanno_Creek" title="wikilink">Fanno Creek</a>, which drains <a href="Hillsdale,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Hillsdale</a> and Portland's southwest suburbs, emptying into the <a href="Tualatin_River" title="wikilink">Tualatin River</a>; <a href="Tryon_Creek" title="wikilink">Tryon Creek</a>, which empties into the Willamette near <a href="Lake_Oswego,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Lake Oswego</a>; and numerous small streams in the <a href="Forest_Park" title="wikilink">Forest Park</a> area, such as <a href="Balch_Creek" title="wikilink">Balch Creek</a>, that flow through Portland and drain directly into the Willamette.</p>
<p>Historically, other small watersheds and subwatersheds existed in the Portland basin. On the city's west side, two named streams, Tanner Creek and Johnson Creek, appear on early settlement maps, but they have since been diverted into underground pipes. The buried Johnson Creek on the west side has no relationship to the Johnson Creek on the east side.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Nineteenth-century maps also show numerous springs and small streams flowing into a wetland that covered an area of today's southeast Portland between Powell Boulevard (<a href="U.S._Route_26" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 26</a>) and Johnson Creek, a distance of . Though most of the wetland complex has been filled in and built upon, remnants exist at the <a href="Crystal_Springs_Rhododendron_Garden" title="wikilink">Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden</a> on Crystal Springs Creek. Old maps also show two streams flowing into a slough that drained part of the wetland. One flowed through the Clinton Street neighborhood, about six city blocks north of Powell Boulevard, and the other drained the Colonial Heights neighborhood, slightly further north near <a href="Ladd&#39;s_Addition,_Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Ladd's Addition</a>. These streams and most others in this area were diverted into the city sewer system and no longer appear on the surface.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><img src="Chinook.png" title="fig:Traditional Chinook tribal territory is shown in dark green in the lower Columbia River basin, including Johnson Creek. The Clackamas tribe of the Chinooks fished and hunted along the creek until the mid-19th century." alt="Traditional Chinook tribal territory is shown in dark green in the lower Columbia River basin, including Johnson Creek. The Clackamas tribe of the Chinooks fished and hunted along the creek until the mid-19th century." /> Before settlers moved into the basin, it consisted mainly of upland and <a href="wetland" class="uri" title="wikilink">wetland</a> forests in which <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native Americans</a> fished, hunted, and foraged. Evidence suggests that people lived in the northern Oregon <a href="Cascade_Range" title="wikilink">Cascades</a> as early as 10,000 years ago. By 2,000 to 3,000 years ago, settlements in the <a href="Clackamas_River" title="wikilink">Clackamas River</a> basin, adjacent to the Johnson Creek watershed, had moved to the river's lower floodplain. The area was the home of the <a href="Clackamas_(tribe)" title="wikilink">Clackamas Indians</a>, <a href="Chinookan_languages" title="wikilink">Chinookan</a> speakers who lived in the Columbia River Valley from <a href="Celilo_Falls" title="wikilink">Celilo Falls</a> to the Pacific Ocean. Their lands included the lower Willamette River from <a href="Willamette_Falls" title="wikilink">Willamette Falls</a> at what became <a href="Oregon_City,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Oregon City, Oregon</a>, to its confluence with the Columbia River and reached into the foothills of the Cascades. When <a href="Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition" title="wikilink">Lewis and Clark</a> visited the area in 1806, the Clackamas tribe consisted of about 1,800 people living in 11 villages. Epidemics of <a href="smallpox" class="uri" title="wikilink">smallpox</a>, <a href="malaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">malaria</a>, and <a href="measles" class="uri" title="wikilink">measles</a> reduced this population to 88 by 1851, and in 1855 the tribe signed a treaty surrendering its lands, including Johnson Creek.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>By the middle of the 19th century, the <a href="European_American" title="wikilink">European American</a> newcomers had begun to remove vegetation, build sawmills, fell trees, fill wetlands, and farm in the fertile soil along Johnson Creek. The creek is named for one of these newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood of Portland and operated a water-powered sawmill.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In early 1848 Lot Whitcomb, who would later found <a href="Milwaukie,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Milwaukie</a>, filed a <a href="Donation_Land_Claim_Act" title="wikilink">donation land claim</a> and built a sawmill near the confluence of Johnson Creek and the Willamette River.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In 1886, plans were made for train tracks along the creek. In 1903, the Springwater Division Line, also known as the Portland Traction Company Line, the Cazadero Line, and the Bellrose Line, was built along Johnson Creek to provide rail transport for passengers and freight.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Lents, and <a href="Pleasant_Valley,_Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Pleasant Valley</a> were among the new communities that grew up along the line.

<p>By removing the original vegetation, rural and urban development of the Johnson Creek watershed induced more rapid storm runoff and expensive floods. As a flood-control measure in the 1930s, the <a href="Works_Progress_Administration" title="wikilink">Works Progress Administration</a> of the <a href="Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">federal government</a> cleared and lined with rock about 90 percent of the creek between its mouth and Southeast 158th Avenue, (near RM 15), creating an artificial channel  to  deep and  to  wide.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Although substantially altering the stream and its aquatic life, this channel failed to prevent overflows, the largest of which damaged 1,200 structures in 1964.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Precipitation patterns in the Johnson Creek watershed have contributed to frequent high flows and floods along the creek, typically between November and February.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Based on records from 1961 to 1990, Portland's average annual precipitation, as measured at <a href="Portland_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Portland International Airport</a> along the Columbia River, is about .<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> About  falls from November through February and only about  from June through September.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The airport, at about  above sea level, is at essentially the same elevation as the mouth of Johnson Creek.
