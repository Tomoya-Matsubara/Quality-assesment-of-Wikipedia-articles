<p>Rather than directly administering microfinance programs, Grameen Foundation provides funds and technical assistance to local and regional microfinance institutions (MFIs) and other poverty-focused organizations. Grameen Foundation works with these organizations to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help them find financing, either through loan-guarantee programs (Growth Guarantees) or direct funding (Pioneer Fund)</li>
<li>Improve their IT systems, through <a href="Mifos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mifos</a>, its open-source MIS software</li>
<li>Ensure that their staff are as productive as possible, through services and consulting provided by its Human Capital Center</li>
<li>Measure whether their efforts are reaching the poor, though its Progress out of Poverty Index (PPI)</li>
</ul>
<p>Working with local and global allies, Grameen Foundation also develops and distributes mobile phone-based applications to help the poor to better manage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their health, through such programs as the Mobile Technology for Community Health (MOTECH) initiative in Ghana</li>
<li>Their crops, through such programs as the Community Knowledge Worker initiative in Uganda</li>
<li>Their finances, though such programs as the Mobile Money initiative in Kenya</li>
</ul>
<p>Grameen Foundation also works to help the poor receive training and benefit from small-business opportunities, further enabling them to improve their lives and break the cycle of poverty for themselves and their families. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
