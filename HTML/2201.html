<p><strong>James Proctor Knott</strong> (August 29, 1830  June 18, 1911) was a <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">U.S. Representative</a> from <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a> and served as <a href="governor_of_Kentucky" title="wikilink">governor of Kentucky</a> from 1883 to 1887. Born in Kentucky, he moved to <a href="Missouri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Missouri</a> in 1850 and began his political career there. He served as <a href="Missouri_Attorney_General" title="wikilink">Missouri Attorney General</a> from 1859 to 1861, when he resigned rather than swear an oath of allegiance to the federal government just prior to the outbreak of the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a>.</p>
<p>Knott was disbarred and briefly imprisoned for his refusal to take the oath of allegiance. He returned to Kentucky in 1863 and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1871, he made a notable speech ridiculing the a bill to subsidize westward expansion of railroads. In the speech, he lampooned the remote town of <a href="Duluth,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Duluth, Minnesota</a>. The Duluth speech was eventually reprinted in several publications and brought Knott national acclaim. He did not stand for re-election in 1871, instead making a failed bid for governor. In 1875, he returned to the House and served as chair of the judiciary committee.</p>
<p>In 1883, Knott left Congress and made a successful run for governor. He secured major reforms in education, but was stymied in his pursuit of tax reform. After his term as governor, he was a delegate to the state's constitutional convention in 1891. In 1892, he became a professor at <a href="Centre_College" title="wikilink">Centre College</a> in <a href="Danville,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Danville, Kentucky</a> and in 1894, helped organized the college's law school. He served as dean of the school until an illness forced him to retire in 1902. He died at his home in <a href="Lebanon,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Lebanon, Kentucky</a> on August 29, 1830.</p>

<p>In 1863, Knott returned to Kentucky and re-opened his legal practice in <a href="Lebanon,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Lebanon</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> He was elected as a <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democrat</a> to the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">U.S. House of Representatives</a> in 1867.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> As a legislator, he opposed the <a href="Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Reconstruction</a> agenda of the <a href="Radical_Republican" title="wikilink">Radical Republicans</a> and ratification of the <a href="Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">Fourteenth</a> and <a href="Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">Fifteenth</a> amendments.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> He was re-elected to a second term, but did not stand for re-election in 1870.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Knott's most notable action as a legislator occurred near the end of his first stint in Congress. On January 27, 1871, he delivered a satirical speech ridiculing a bill that would have provided fifty-seven land grants and financial concessions to railroads to further their westward expansion.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Knott singled out the <a href="Bayfield_and_St._Croix_Railroad" title="wikilink">Bayfield and St. Croix Railroad</a>'s proposed line from the <a href="St._Croix_River_(Wisconsin-Minnesota)" title="wikilink">St. Croix River</a> to <a href="Duluth,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Duluth, Minnesota</a> to make his point.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Following the speech, the railroad bill was killed and Congress adjourned for the day.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Knott's speech, known as <em>Duluth!</em> or <em>The Untold Delights of Duluth</em>, brought him national acclaim and copies of the speech were reprinted and sold.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Residents of Duluth apparently were not offended by the speech, extending an offer for Knott to visit the city he had ridiculed; Knott accepted the offer in 1891.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> A rail car sorting yard outside of Duluth was named after Proctor Knott in 1890, and the town of &quot;Proctorknott&quot;, now <a href="Proctor,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Proctor, Minnesota</a>, took its name from those yards and from Proctor Knott himself.</p>
<p>In 1871, Knott made an unsuccessful bid to become governor of Kentucky, losing the Democratic nomination to <a href="Preston_Leslie" title="wikilink">Preston Leslie</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He was re-elected to the House of Representatives in 1875, serving four consecutive terms.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> He chaired the <a href="United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary" title="wikilink">House Judiciary Committee</a> for the first three of these terms.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In 1876, he was named one of the managers of <a href="impeachment" class="uri" title="wikilink">impeachment</a> proceedings against ex-<a href="United_States_Secretary_of_War" title="wikilink">Secretary of War</a> <a href="William_W._Belknap" title="wikilink">William W.

<h3 id="as-governor-of-kentucky">As governor of Kentucky</h3>
<p>Knott was one of several candidates vying for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1883. Other prominent candidates included Congressman <a href="Thomas_Laurens_Jones" title="wikilink">Thomas Laurens Jones</a>, former <a href="Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Confederate</a> general <a href="Simon_Bolivar_Buckner,_Sr." title="wikilink">Simon Bolivar Buckner</a>, Judge John S. Owsley, and <a href="List_of_mayors_of_Louisville,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Louisville mayor</a> <a href="Charles_Donald_Jacob" title="wikilink">Charles Donald Jacob</a>. Balloting began on May 16, 1883, with Jones being the leading vote-getter, but unable to secure a <a href="majority" class="uri" title="wikilink">majority</a>. After four ballots, Jacob withdrew his name, and Knott moved into the lead. The following day, Owsley dropped out of the balloting, and Knott extended his lead. Though Buckner remained on the ballot, the race came down to Jones and Knott. Delegates from <a href="Owen_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Owen County</a> switched to Knott, and other counties soon followed suit. Jones withdrew, and Knott was nominated unanimously.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>In the general election, Knott defeated <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> Thomas Z. Morrow by a margin of nearly 45,000 votes.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> During his term in office, Knott asked the legislature to conduct a thorough reform of the state's tax system, but the legislators' only response was to create a board of equalization charged with making equitable assessments.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> They also refused to grant the Railroad Commission all the powers Knott had requested.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Knott's most successful initiatives were in the area of education. The state established a teacher training school for <a href="African-American" title="wikilink">blacks</a> in <a href="Frankfort,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Frankfort</a> and created a state teacher's organization.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The legislature also approved the construction of the <a href="Kentucky_State_Penitentiary" title="wikilink">Kentucky State Penitentiary</a> at <a href="Eddyville,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Eddyville</a>, a project for which Knott's predecessor, <a href="Luke_P._Blackburn" title="wikilink">Luke P. Blackburn</a> had laid the groundwork.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Feuds continued to rage in Kentucky during Knott's term in office, including one that lasted several years in <a href="Rowan_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Rowan County</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Knott refused to acknowledge lawlessness as a problem, however, and eventually became known for the number of <a href="clemency" title="wikilink">pardons</a> he granted as governor.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="later-life-and-death">Later life and death</h2>
<p>Following his term as governor, Knott continued his legal practice in Frankfort.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> He declined two separate appointments offered to him by <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="Grover_Cleveland" title="wikilink">Grover Cleveland</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The first was to become <a href="Governor_of_Hawaii" title="wikilink">Territorial Governor of Hawai'i</a> and the other was an appointment to the <a href="Interstate_Commerce_Commission" title="wikilink">Interstate Commerce Commission</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Knott served as a special assistant to Kentucky's attorney general in 1887 and 1888, and in 1891, he was chosen as a delegate to the state constitutional convention.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
