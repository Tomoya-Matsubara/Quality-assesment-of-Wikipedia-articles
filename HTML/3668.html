He became the BBC's chief political correspondent in 1999, and between 2002 and 2005 he worked for <a href="ITV_News" title="wikilink">ITV News</a> as political editor, but then returned to the BBC assuming the same role, which he has held since.</p>

Bush</a>. His history of Conservative affiliation has been controversial, particularly when allegations of bias were made during his coverage of the <a href="2010_United_Kingdom_general_election" title="wikilink">2010 United Kingdom general election</a>.

<p>In 2002, Robinson left the BBC for <a href="Independent_Television_News" title="wikilink">Independent Television News</a> (ITN) as ITV News' <a href="political_editor" title="wikilink">political editor</a>. <a href="Tom_Bradby" title="wikilink">Tom Bradby</a>, who later succeeded him, described the appointment as &quot;bold, imaginative and instantly successful&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Robinson stayed with ITN for three years, and caused a major stir early in the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_2005" title="wikilink">2005 election</a> campaign at the unveiling of a <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour Party</a> poster. The poster claimed the <a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Conservative Party</a> would initiate cuts of <a href="GBP" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00A3&gt;</a>35 billion to public services if elected; Robinson challenged <a href="Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Tony_Blair" title="wikilink">Tony Blair</a>, claiming the poster was misleading,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> which forced Blair to admit the &lt;U+00A3&gt;35 billion figure was &quot;disingenuous&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Later on in the election campaign, Labour announced that Tony Blair would be making &quot;the most important speech of the campaign&quot; on immigration, with a specially invited audience. Robinson asked Blair why there were only white people in the audience, and Blair pointed out a single Asian man to disprove Robinson. Later, Robinson stated &quot;We know that the big two parties carefully select audiences to give a particular appearance. Is it a great controversy to point this out? That's informing the audience.&quot; On election night, Robinson joined presenters <a href="Jonathan_Dimbleby" title="wikilink">Jonathan Dimbleby</a> and <a href="Alastair_Stewart" title="wikilink">Alastair Stewart</a> to reveal the results with political analysis.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="return-to-the-bbc-2005u2013present">Return to the BBC: 2005&lt;U+2013&gt;present</h3>
<p>Robinson left ITN and was appointed as the BBC political editor in preference to fellow journalist <a href="Martha_Kearney" title="wikilink">Martha Kearney</a> in August 2005, replacing <a href="Andrew_Marr" title="wikilink">Andrew Marr</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Robinson continued his provocative approach to journalism, and on more than one occasion had run-ins with powerful politicians. During Tony Blair's visit to Israel in 2006 to discuss the <a href="Lebanon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lebanon</a> war, journalists were asked not to bring up the ongoing rift with Gordon Brown. Tom Bradby, the ITV political editor, asked a question on the subject but was told it was &quot;disrespectful&quot;. Robinson then followed on the same topic, asking a difficult question on the feud between the Chancellor and Prime Minister. He was criticised for distracting from the main issue of the conference, but he argued that &quot;I'm paid to ask questions... particularly at a time when there are incredibly serious allegations... I react very badly to organised attempts to stop journalists asking questions.&quot; Robinson later criticised Blair's announcement of his intention to stand down. He explained how he considered the setup &quot;stage management&quot;, and how no journalists were allowed to ask questions.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In December 2006 he got a very hard stare from <a href="George_W._Bush" title="wikilink">George W. Bush</a> when he asked him if he was in denial about the situation in Iraq (since the most Bush had said about the situation was that the increase in attacks was &quot;unsettling&quot;). Bush replied coldly &quot;It's bad in Iraq. Does that help?&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> He had another run in with Bush at a press conference at <a href="Camp_David" title="wikilink">Camp David</a>, when Bush asked him &quot;you still hanging around?&quot;. He then suggested to Robinson, with reference to the heat, that &quot;next time you should cover your bald head&quot;. As Bush walked away Robinson replied &quot;I didn't know you cared&quot;, to which Bush responded &quot;I don't&quot;. Robinson described his quip as a &quot;fatal error&quot; on his blog.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In a final encounter in 2008, Bush joked with Robinson about still not wearing his hat.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Robinson continues to keep a <a href="blog" class="uri" title="wikilink">blog</a> on the BBC website, which discusses politics. His posts have occasionally caused controversy: on 5 May 2006 he raised eyebrows with the revelation that when hearing of <a href="Charles_Clarke" title="wikilink">Charles Clarke</a>'s sacking in the 2006 Cabinet reshuffle, he was &quot;naked in bed.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He later apologised, saying he was &quot;merely trying to add authenticity. That's the naked truth.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> This incident briefly earnt him the nickname &quot;Naked Nick&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Another post dated 25 February 2008 criticised MPs defending <a href="Michael_Martin,_Baron_Martin_of_Springburn" title="wikilink">Michael Martin</a> against allegations of expenses misuse,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> which caused controversy in parliament.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Outside of his work as political editor, Robinson has also worked on politics-related programmes, such as <em><a href="The_Daily_Politics" title="wikilink">The Daily Politics</a></em>, <em><a href="Newsnight" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newsnight</a></em> and <em><a href="Today_(BBC_Radio_4)" title="wikilink">Today</a></em> on <a href="BBC_Radio_4" title="wikilink">BBC Radio 4</a>. He joined <a href="David_Dimbleby" title="wikilink">David Dimbleby</a>, <a href="Jeremy_Paxman" title="wikilink">Jeremy Paxman</a>, <a href="Jeremy_Vine" title="wikilink">Jeremy Vine</a> and <a href="Emily_Maitlis" title="wikilink">Emily Maitlis</a> to report and provide analysis on the <a href="2010_United_Kingdom_general_election" title="wikilink">2010 United Kingdom general election</a> night.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> He has also appeared as guests in other television programmes, including <em><a href="Children_in_Need" title="wikilink">Children in Need</a></em>, <em><a href="Have_I_Got_News_for_You" title="wikilink">Have I Got News for You</a></em>,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> and <em><a href="Top_Gear_(2002_TV_series)" title="wikilink">Top Gear</a></em>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="criticism">Criticism</h3>
<p>Robinson has been criticised for allegedly reporting with a pro-<a href="Tory" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tory</a> bias, and <a href="Alastair_Campbell" title="wikilink">Alastair Campbell</a> brought up his history of conservative affiliations when confronted with a difficult question.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Bias was claimed particularly in the <a href="2010_United_Kingdom_general_election" title="wikilink">2010 United Kingdom general election</a> coverage; a <a href="Facebook" class="uri" title="wikilink">Facebook</a> group entitled &quot;Nick Robinson should not be the BBC's political editor&quot; was set up and as of August 2010 has over 2000 members.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In a 2005 interview with David Rowan, the UK editor of <a href="Wired_News" title="wikilink">Wired News</a>, he insisted &quot;that his involvement [with the Conservatives] ceased 20 years ago&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>He has also reported receiving <a href="hate_mail" title="wikilink">hate mail</a> about his distinctive <a href="Gucci" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gucci</a> glasses, including one advising him to &quot;go to <a href="Specsavers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Specsavers</a>&quot;. Advised by a fashion expert to get a distinctive pair, &quot;or risk fading into the background&quot;,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> they have become his trademark, along with his bald head and provocative approach to journalism and politics. When he joined BBC News in 1999, he was almost made to wear <a href="contact_lenses" title="wikilink">contact lenses</a> instead but he refused,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> stating they were &quot;like large pieces of grit in [his] eye&quot;.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
