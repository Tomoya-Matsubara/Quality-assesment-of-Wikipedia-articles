<p><strong>Maya Angelou</strong> (;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> born <strong>Marguerite Annie Johnson</strong>; April 4, 1928 &lt;U+2013&gt; May 28, 2014) was an African-American author, poet, dancer, actress and singer. She published seven autobiographies, three books of essays, and several books of poetry, and was credited with a list of plays, movies, and television shows spanning more than 50 years. She received dozens of awards and over fifty honorary degrees.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Angelou is best known for her series of seven autobiographies, which focus on her childhood and early adult experiences. The first, <em><a href="I_Know_Why_the_Caged_Bird_Sings" title="wikilink">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a></em> (1969), tells of her life up to the age of seventeen and brought her international recognition and acclaim.</p>
<p>She became a poet and writer after a series of occupations as a young adult, including fry cook, prostitute, nightclub dancer and performer, cast member of the opera <em><a href="Porgy_and_Bess" title="wikilink">Porgy and Bess</a></em>, coordinator for the <a href="Southern_Christian_Leadership_Conference" title="wikilink">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a>, and journalist in <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a> and <a href="Ghana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ghana</a> during the <a href="decolonization_of_Africa" title="wikilink">decolonization of Africa</a>. She was an actor, writer, director, and producer of plays, movies, and public television programs. From 1982, she taught at <a href="Wake_Forest_University" title="wikilink">Wake Forest University</a> in <a href="Winston-Salem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Winston-Salem</a>, <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a>, where she held the first lifetime Reynolds Professorship of American Studies. She was active in the <a href="American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955-1968)" title="wikilink">Civil Rights movement</a>, and worked with <a href="Martin_Luther_King,_Jr." title="wikilink">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> and <a href="Malcolm_X" title="wikilink">Malcolm X</a>. Beginning in the 1990s, she made around 80 appearances a year on the lecture circuit, something she continued into her eighties. In 1993, Angelou recited her poem &quot;<a href="On_the_Pulse_of_Morning" title="wikilink">On the Pulse of Morning</a>&quot; (1993) at President <a href="Bill_Clinton" title="wikilink">Bill Clinton</a>'s inauguration, making her the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since <a href="Robert_Frost" title="wikilink">Robert Frost</a> at President <a href="John_F._Kennedy" title="wikilink">John F. Kennedy</a>'s inauguration in 1961.</p>
<p>With the publication of <em>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</em>, Angelou publicly discussed aspects of her personal life. She was respected as a spokesperson for black people and women, and her works have been considered a defense of Black culture. Attempts have been made to ban her books from some U.S. libraries, but her works are widely used in schools and universities worldwide. Angelou's major works have been labeled as <a href="autobiographical_fiction" title="wikilink">autobiographical fiction</a>, but many critics have characterized them as autobiographies. She made a deliberate attempt to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Her books center on themes such as racism, identity, family, and travel.</p>

In &quot;an astonishing exception&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> to the harsh economics of African-Americans of the time, Angelou's grandmother prospered financially during the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a> and <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> because the <a href="general_store" title="wikilink">general store</a> she owned sold needed basic commodities and because &quot;she made wise and honest investments&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>  </p>
<p>Four years later, the children's father &quot;came to Stamps without warning&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and returned them to their mother's care in St. Louis. At the age of eight, while living with her mother, Angelou was sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, a man named Freeman. She told her brother, who told the rest of their family. Freeman was found guilty but was jailed for only one day. Four days after his release, he was murdered, probably by Angelou's uncles.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Angelou became mute for almost five years,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> believing, as she stated, &quot;I thought, my voice killed him; I killed that man, because I told his name.

<h3 id="personal-life">Personal life</h3>

<p>Evidence suggests that Angelou was partially descended from the <a href="Mende_people" title="wikilink">Mende people</a> of West Africa.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> A 2008 <a href="Public_Broadcasting_Service" title="wikilink">PBS</a> documentary found that Angelou's maternal great-grandmother Mary Lee, who had been emancipated after the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a>, became pregnant by her white former owner, John Savin. Savin forced Lee to sign a false statement accusing another man of being the father of her child. After indicting Savin for forcing Lee to commit perjury, and despite discovering that Savin was the father, a jury found him not guilty. Lee was sent to the Clinton County <a href="poorhouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">poorhouse</a> in <a href="Missouri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Missouri</a> with her daughter, Marguerite Baxter, who became Angelou's grandmother. Angelou described Lee as &quot;that poor little Black girl, physically and mentally bruised.&quot;<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>The details of Angelou's life described in her seven autobiographies and in numerous interviews, speeches, and articles tended to be inconsistent. Critic Mary Jane Lupton has explained that when Angelou spoke about her life, she did so eloquently but informally and &quot;with no time chart in front of her&quot;.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> For example, she was married at least twice, but never clarified the number of times she had been married, &quot;for fear of sounding frivolous&quot;;<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> according to her autobiographies and to Gillespie, she married Tosh Angelos in 1951 and Paul du Feu in 1973, and began her relationship with Vusumzi Make in 1961, but never formally married him. Angelou had one son Guy, whose birth was described in her first autobiography, one grandson, and two great-grandchildren,<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> and according to Gillespie, a large group of friends and extended family. Angelou's mother Vivian Baxter died in 1991 and her brother Bailey Johnson, Jr., died in 2000 after a series of strokes; both were important figures in her life and her books,.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> In 1981, the mother of her son Guy's child disappeared with Angelou's grandson; it took eight years to find him.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> In 2009, the gossip website <a href="TMZ" class="uri" title="wikilink">TMZ</a> erroneously reported that Angelou had been hospitalized in Los Angeles when she was alive and well in St. Louis, which resulted in rumors of her death and according to Angelou, concern among her friends and family worldwide.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>She did not earn a university degree, but according to Gillespie it was Angelou's preference that she be called &quot;Dr. Angelou&quot; by people outside of her family and close friends. As of 2008, she owned two homes in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and a &quot;lordly brownstone&quot;<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> in <a href="Harlem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harlem</a>, full of her &quot;growing library&quot;<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> of books she collected throughout her life, artwork collected over the span of many decades, and well-stocked kitchens. Younge reported that in her Harlem home resides several African wall hangings and Angelou's collection of paintings, including ones of several jazz trumpeters, a watercolor of <a href="Rosa_Parks" title="wikilink">Rosa Parks</a>, and a <a href="Faith_Ringgold" title="wikilink">Faith Ringgold</a> work entitled &quot;Maya's Quilt Of Life&quot;.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> According to Gillespie, she hosted several celebrations per year at her main residence in Winston-Salem, including Thanksgiving;<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> &quot;her skill in the kitchen is the stuff of legend&lt;U+2014&gt;from haute cuisine to down-home comfort food&quot;.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> She combined her cooking and writing skills in her 2004 book <em><a href="Hallelujah!_The_Welcome_Table" title="wikilink">Hallelujah!

<p>Beginning with <em>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</em>, Angelou used the same &quot;writing ritual&quot;<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> for many years. She would wake early in the morning and check into a hotel room, where the staff was instructed to remove any pictures from the walls. She would write on legal pads while lying on the bed, with only a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play <a href="solitaire" class="uri" title="wikilink">solitaire</a>, <em><a href="Roget&#39;s_Thesaurus" title="wikilink">Roget's Thesaurus</a></em>, and the Bible, and would leave by the early afternoon. She would average 10&lt;U+2013&gt;12 pages of written material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Angelou went through this process to &quot;enchant&quot; herself, and as she said in a 1989 interview with the <a href="British_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="wikilink">British Broadcasting Corporation</a>, &quot;relive the agony, the anguish, the <em><a href="Sturm_und_Drang" title="wikilink">Sturm und Drang</a></em>.&quot;<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even traumatic experiences like her rape in <em>Caged Bird</em>, in order to &quot;tell the human truth&quot;<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> about her life. Angelou stated that she played cards in order to get to that place of enchantment and in order to access her memories more effectively. She stated, &quot;It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it&lt;U+2014&gt;ha! It's so delicious!&quot;<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in &quot;telling the truth&quot;.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>

Although Angelou had reportedly been in poor health and had canceled recent scheduled appearances, she was working on another book, an autobiography about her experiences with national and world leaders.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a><a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> During her memorial service at Wake Forest University, her son Guy Johnson stated that despite being in constant pain due to her dancing career and respiratory failure, she wrote four books during the last ten years of her life.

<p>Angelou wrote a total of seven autobiographies.

Angelou wrote five collections of essays, which writer <a href="Hilton_Als" title="wikilink">Hilton Als</a> called her &quot;wisdom books&quot; and &quot;homilies strung together with autobiographical texts&quot;.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> Angelou used the same editor throughout her writing career, <a href="Robert_Loomis" title="wikilink">Robert Loomis</a>, an executive editor at <a href="Random_House" title="wikilink">Random House</a>; he retired in 2011<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> and has been called &quot;one of publishing's hall of fame editors.&quot;<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> Angelou said regarding Loomis: &quot;We have a relationship that's kind of famous among publishers&quot;.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Angelou_Obama.jpg" title="fig:President Barack Obama presenting Angelou with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, 2011" alt="President Barack Obama presenting Angelou with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, 2011" /> When <em>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</em> was published in 1969, Angelou was hailed as a new kind of memoirist, one of the first African American women who were able to publicly discuss their personal lives. According to scholar Hilton Als, up to that point, black female writers were marginalized to the point that they were unable to present themselves as central characters in the literature they wrote.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> Scholar <a href="John_McWhorter" title="wikilink">John McWhorter</a> agreed, seeing Angelou's works, which he called &quot;tracts&quot;, as &quot;apologetic writing&quot;. He placed Angelou in the tradition of African-American literature as a defense of black culture, which he called &quot;a literary manifestation of the imperative that reigned in the black scholarship of the period&quot;.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> Writer Julian Mayfield, who called <em>Caged Bird</em> &quot;a work of art that eludes description&quot;,<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> argued that Angelou's autobiographies set a precedent for not only other black women writers, but also African American autobiography as a whole. Als said that <em>Caged Bird</em> marked one of the first times that a black autobiographer could, as he put it, &quot;write about blackness from the inside, without apology or defense&quot;.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> Through the writing of her autobiography, Angelou became recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for blacks and women.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> It made her &quot;without a doubt, ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer&quot;,<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> and &quot;a major autobiographical voice of the time&quot;.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> As writer Gary Younge said, &quot;Probably more than almost any other writer alive, Angelou's life literally is her work&quot;.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>
<p>Author Hilton Als said that <em>Caged Bird</em> helped increase black <a href="feminist" class="uri" title="wikilink">feminist</a> writings in the 1970s, less through its originality than &quot;its resonance in the prevailing <a href="Zeitgeist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zeitgeist</a>&quot;,<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> or the time in which it was written, at the end of the American <a href="American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955-1968)" title="wikilink">Civil Rights movement</a>. Als also claimed that Angelou's writings, more interested in self-revelation than in politics or feminism, have freed other female writers to &quot;open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world&quot;.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> Angelou critic Joanne M. Braxton stated that <em>Caged Bird</em> was &quot;perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing&quot; autobiography written by an African-American woman in its era.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>

Her honors included a <a href="Pulitzer_Prize" title="wikilink">Pulitzer Prize</a> nomination for her book of poetry, <em>Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie,</em><a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> a <a href="Tony_Award" title="wikilink">Tony Award</a> nomination for her role in the 1973 play <em>Look Away</em>, and three <a href="Grammy_Award" title="wikilink">Grammys</a> for her spoken word albums.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a><a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> She served on two presidential committees,<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a><a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> and was awarded the <a href="National_Medal_of_Arts" title="wikilink">National Medal of Arts</a> in 2000,<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> the Lincoln Medal in 2008,<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> and the <a href="Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom" title="wikilink">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> in 2011.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> Angelou was awarded over fifty honorary degrees.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="uses-in-education">Uses in education</h3>
<p>Angelou's autobiographies have been used in <a href="narrative" class="uri" title="wikilink">narrative</a> and multicultural approaches in <a href="teacher_education" title="wikilink">teacher education</a>. Jocelyn A. Glazier, a professor at <a href="George_Washington_University" title="wikilink">George Washington University</a>, has trained teachers how to &quot;talk about race&quot; in their classrooms with <em>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</em> and <em>Gather Together in My Name</em>. According to Glazier, Angelou's use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony have left readers of Angelou's autobiographies unsure of what she left out and how they should respond to the events she described. Angelou's depictions of her experiences of racism have forced white readers to explore their feelings about race and their own &quot;privileged status&quot;. Glazier found that critics have focused on where Angelou fits within the genre of African-American autobiography and on her <a href="literary_techniques" title="wikilink">literary techniques</a>, but readers have tended to react to her storytelling with &quot;surprise, particularly when [they] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography&quot;.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
<p>Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book <em>Stories of Resilience in Childhood</em>, analyzed the events in <em>Caged Bird</em> to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener argued that Angelou's book has provided a &quot;useful framework&quot; for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya have faced and how communities have helped them succeed.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has reported using <em>Caged Bird</em> to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of <a href="child_development" title="wikilink">child development</a> topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He found the book a &quot;highly effective&quot; tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="poetry">Poetry</h2>

<p>Angelou is best known for her seven autobiographies, but she was also a prolific and successful poet. She was called &quot;the black woman's poet laureate&quot;, and her poems have been called the anthems of African Americans.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> Angelou studied and began writing poetry at a young age, and used poetry and other great literature to cope with her rape as a young girl, as described in <em>Caged Bird</em>.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> According to scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout, literature also affected Angelou's sensibilities as the poet and writer she became, especially the &quot;liberating discourse that would evolve in her own poetic canon&quot;.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
<p>Many critics consider Angelou's autobiographies more important than her poetry.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> Although her books have been best-sellers, her poetry has not been perceived to be as serious as her prose and has been understudied.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> Her poems were more interesting when she recited and performed them, and many critics emphasized the public aspect of her poetry.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> Angelou's lack of critical acclaim has been attributed to both the public nature of many of her poems and to Angelou's popular success, and to critics' preferences for poetry as a written form rather than a verbal, performed one.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> Zofia Burr has countered Angelou's critics by condemning them for not taking into account Angelou's larger purposes in her writing: &quot;to be representative rather than individual, authoritative rather than confessional&quot;.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="style-and-genre-in-autobiographies">Style and genre in autobiographies</h2>

<p>Angelou's use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and development of theme, setting, plot, and language has often resulted in the placement of her books into the genre of <a href="autobiographical_fiction" title="wikilink">autobiographical fiction</a>.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> Angelou made a deliberate attempt in her books to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> Scholar Mary Jane Lupton argues that all of Angelou's autobiographies conform to the genre's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> Angelou recognizes that there are fictional aspects to her books; Lupton agrees, stating that Angelou tended to &quot;diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth&quot;,<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> which parallels the conventions of much of African-American autobiography written during the <a href="Abolitionism_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">abolitionist</a> period of U.S. history, when as both Lupton and African-American scholar Crispin Sartwell put it, the truth was censored out of the need for self-protection.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a><a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> Scholar Lyman B. Hagen places Angelou in the long tradition of African-American autobiography, but claims that Angelou created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Maya_Angelou_visits_YCP_Feb_2013.jpg" title="fig:Angelou at York College in February 2013" alt="Angelou at York College in February 2013" width="200" /> According to African American literature scholar Pierre A. Walker, the challenge for much of the history of African-American literature was that its authors have had to confirm its status as literature before they could accomplish their political goals, which was why Angelou's editor <a href="Robert_Loomis" title="wikilink">Robert Loomis</a> was able to dare her into writing <em>Caged Bird</em> by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered &quot;high art&quot;.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> Angelou acknowledged that she followed the slave narrative tradition of &quot;speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'&quot;.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> Scholar John McWhorter calls Angelou's books &quot;tracts&quot;<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> that defend African-American culture and fight negative stereotypes. According to McWhorter, Angelou structured her books, which to him seem to be written more for children than for adults, to support her defense of black culture. McWhorter sees Angelou as she depicts herself in her autobiographies &quot;as a kind of stand-in figure for the black American in Troubled Times&quot;.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> McWhorter views Angelou's works as dated, but recognizes that &quot;she has helped to pave the way for contemporary black writers who are able to enjoy the luxury of being merely individuals, no longer representatives of the race, only themselves&quot;.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> Scholar Lynn Z. Bloom compares Angelou's works to the writings of <a href="Frederick_Douglass" title="wikilink">Frederick Douglass</a>, stating that both fulfilled the same purpose: to describe black culture and to interpret it for their wider, white audiences.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a></p>
<p>According to scholar Sondra O'Neale, Angelou's poetry can be placed within the African-American oral tradition, and her prose &quot;follows classic technique in nonpoetic Western forms&quot;.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> O'Neale states that Angelou avoided using a &quot;monolithic black language&quot;,<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> and accomplished, through direct dialogue, what O'Neale calls a &quot;more expected ghetto expressiveness&quot;.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> McWhorter finds both the language Angelou used in her autobiographies and the people she depicted unrealistic, resulting in a separation between her and her audience. As McWhorter states, &quot;I have never read autobiographical writing where I had such a hard time summoning a sense of how the subject talks, or a sense of who the subject really is&quot;.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> McWhorter asserts, for example, that key figures in Angelou's books, like herself, her son Guy, and mother Vivian do not speak as one would expect, and that their speech is &quot;cleaned up&quot; for her readers.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> Guy, for example, represents the young black male, while Vivian represents the idealized mother figure, and the stiff language they use, as well as the language in Angelou's text, is intended to prove that blacks can competently use standard English.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>
<p>McWhorter recognizes that much of the reason for Angelou's style was the &quot;apologetic&quot; nature of her writing.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> When Angelou wrote <em>Caged Bird</em> at the end of the 1960s, one of the necessary and accepted features of literature at the time was &quot;organic unity&quot;, and one of her goals was to create a book that satisfied that criterion.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> The events in her books were episodic and crafted like a series of short stories, but their arrangements did not follow a strict chronology. Instead, they were placed to emphasize the <a href="Themes_in_Maya_Angelou&#39;s_autobiographies" title="wikilink">themes of her books</a>, which include racism, identity, family, and travel. English literature scholar Valerie Sayers has asserted that &quot;Angelou's poetry and prose are similar&quot;. They both rely on her &quot;direct voice&quot;, which alternates steady rhythms with <a href="syncopated" class="uri" title="wikilink">syncopated</a> patterns and uses similes and metaphors (e.g., the caged bird).<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> According to Hagen, Angelou's works were influenced by both conventional literary and the oral traditions of the African-American community. For example, she referenced over 100 literary characters throughout her books and poetry.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> In addition, she used the elements of <a href="blues_music" title="wikilink">blues music</a>, including the act of testimony when speaking of one's life and struggles, ironic understatement, and the use of natural metaphors, rhythms, and intonations.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> Angelou, instead of depending upon plot, used personal and historical events to shape her books.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a></p>
