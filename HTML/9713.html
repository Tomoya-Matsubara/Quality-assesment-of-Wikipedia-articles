<li>As cease-fire negotiations appeared to stall, Israel lobbed artillery rounds into southern Lebanon at daybreak while troops backed by tanks and armored vehicles moved across the border. Israel ratcheted up its fight against Hezbollah, beginning operations aimed at the heart of <a href="Beirut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beirut</a>, taking control of a largely <a href="Christ" title="wikilink">Christian</a> southern Lebanese town. The Israeli military also dropped leaflets in Beirut, warning of expanded operations inside the capital and urging people in southern <a href="Shi&#39;a_Islam" title="wikilink">Shiite</a> neighborhoods to evacuate.

<li>Israeli troops have seized the southern Lebanese town of <a href="Marjeyoun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marjeyoun</a> and heavy clashes were reported in the area around the town after armoured columns crossed the Lebanese border overnight.

Of the 915,000 people the U.N. estimates to be internally displaced in Lebanon, 45 percent are children, it said. Fighting has disrupted the delivery of food, fuel and medical supplies and devastated much of the country's infrastructure, and the U.N. said 100,000 people in southern Lebanon won't be receiving vital relief.

<li>&quot;Right now, what's won is diplomacy has won,&quot; White House press secretary <a href="Tony_Snow" title="wikilink">Tony Snow</a> said, referring to the U.N. resolution that stopped the fighting. He said it wasn't easy to reach the agreement and that there was a &quot;diplomatic taffy-pull as we tried to figure how to get to the resolution that all sides would support.&quot; Snow said it was obvious that Hezbollah had been weakened by the battle -- although Israel did not achieve its objective of delivering a knockout blow to the guerrilla group. He said the cease fire's success &quot;will require placing on the northern border of Lebanon somebody who is capable of handling security in such a way as to intercept, interrupt and, with any luck, stop the transport into Lebanon of arms from Iran and Syria.&quot; &quot;We hope that everybody will stay true to the cease-fire and that the government of Lebanon, again, will be able to have the credibility,&quot; Snow said. &quot;But, you know, a piece of paper outlines the way forward, but a lot of times that still has to be conducted by people on the ground,&quot; the press secretary said. &quot;The people also within Lebanon, the Lebanese government has a role to play, the governments of Syria and Iran have a role to play, Hezbollah has a role to play, the Israelis have a role to play.

<li>Bush made a brief statement at the opening of his meeting at the Pentagon. &quot;We live in troubled times, but I'm confident in our capacity to not only protect the homeland but in our capacity to leave behind a better world,&quot; Bush said. &quot;It's very important for the American people to know that we're constantly thinking about how to secure the homeland, protect our interests and use all assets available to do our jobs,&quot; the president said. The list of challenges facing Bush spread far beyond the fighting between Hezbollah and Israel.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></li>
<li>President Bush called the U.N. resolution that took effect hours earlier an &quot;important step that will help bring an end to the violence&quot; between Israel and Hezbollah. &quot;Hezbollah suffered a defeat in this crisis,&quot; Bush told reporters. &quot;There's going to be a new power in the south of Lebanon,&quot; he said, referring to the U.N. force that will assist the Lebanese army in taking control of the area. &quot;America recognizes that civilians in Lebanon and Israel have suffered from the current violence, and we recognize that responsibility for this suffering lies with Hezbollah,&quot; Bush said. &quot;Responsibility for the suffering of the Lebanese people also lies with Hezbollah's state sponsors, Iran and Syria.&quot;<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a>President Bush blamed Hezbollah, and its supporters in Iran and Syria, for the war, which he said was &quot;part of a broader struggle between freedom and terror.&quot;<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></li>

Hezbollah's <a href="Al-Manar" title="wikilink">al-Manar</a> TV network and pro-Hezbollah NEW TV then picked up the video and condemned the Lebanese soldiers as deserters.

The actions, as depicted in a video where parts may have been deleted and edited, could suggest the Lebanese army is weak and unable to take southern Lebanon back from Hezbollah without help.
