He is best remembered for his <a href="historical_novel" title="wikilink">historical novels</a>.</p>
<p>Born into an impoverished <a href="szlachta" title="wikilink">Polish noble family</a> in Russian-ruled <a href="Congress_Poland" title="wikilink">Congress Poland</a>, in the late 1860s he began publishing journalistic and literary pieces. In the late 1870s he traveled to the United States, sending back travel essays that won him popularity with Polish readers. In the 1880s he began serializing novels that further increased his popularity. He soon became one of the most popular Polish writers of the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, and numerous translations gained him international renown, culminating in his receipt of the 1905 <a href="Nobel_Prize_in_Literature" title="wikilink">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> for his &quot;outstanding merits as an epic writer.&quot;</p>
<p>Many of his novels remain in print.
