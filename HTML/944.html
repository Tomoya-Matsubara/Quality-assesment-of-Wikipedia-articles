<p><strong>Gateshead International Stadium</strong> is a <a href="multi-purpose_stadium" title="wikilink">multi-purpose</a>, <a href="all-seater" class="uri" title="wikilink">all-seater</a> arena in <a href="Felling,_Tyne_and_Wear" title="wikilink">Felling</a>, <a href="Tyne_and_Wear" title="wikilink">Tyne and Wear</a>, England. Originally known as the <strong>Gateshead Youth Stadium</strong>, the venue was built in 1955 at a cost of &lt;U+00A3&gt;30,000. It has since been extensively re-developed on three occasions. Its capacity of around 11,800 is the greatest in the <a href="Metropolitan_Borough_of_Gateshead" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead</a>, the third-largest in Tyne and Wear (behind only <a href="St_James&#39;_Park" title="wikilink">St James' Park</a> and the <a href="Stadium_of_Light" title="wikilink">Stadium of Light</a>) and the sixth-largest in <a href="North_East_England" title="wikilink">North East England</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The main arena is principally used for <a href="Athletics_(sport)" title="wikilink">athletics</a>. The inaugural athletics competition at the redeveloped venue, the 1974 &quot;Gateshead Games&quot;, was instigated by <a href="Brendan_Foster" title="wikilink">Brendan Foster</a>, a Gateshead Council employee at that time. By breaking the world record in the <a href="3000_metres" title="wikilink">mens 3,000 m</a>, Foster brought international publicity to the new stadium and began a tradition of athletics competitions at the venue, which has since hosted the <a href="British_Grand_Prix_(athletics)" title="wikilink">British Grand Prix</a> (2003–10) and the <a href="European_Team_Championships" title="wikilink">European Team Championships</a> in 1989 and 2000. The stadium was selected to host the latter event for a third time&lt;U+2014&gt;the only venue to have done so&lt;U+2014&gt;in 2013. Five world records have been set at the stadium, including two by <a href="pole_vault" title="wikilink">pole vaulter</a> <a href="Yelena_Isinbayeva" title="wikilink">Yelena Isinbayeva</a> and a tied <a href="100_metres" title="wikilink">100 metres</a> record by <a href="Asafa_Powell" title="wikilink">Asafa Powell</a> in 2006.</p>
<p>Although the venue primarily caters for athletics, it is currently home to teams in several sports. <a href="Gateshead_F.C." title="wikilink">Gateshead football club</a> have played their home games at the stadium since they reformed in 1974 though the club plans to vacate the site when their <a href="Gateshead_F.C._new_stadium" title="wikilink">own purpose-built ground</a> is built. Gateshead International Stadium was home to the <a href="Gateshead_Thunder" title="wikilink">Gateshead Thunder</a> <a href="rugby_league" title="wikilink">rugby league</a> club during their spell in the <a href="Super_League" title="wikilink">Super League</a> and the current version of the club play home games in the main arena, which is known as the <strong>Thunderdome</strong> when used by that team.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Gateshead Harriers Athletic Club, which includes Foster and <a href="Jonathan_Edwards_(athlete)" title="wikilink">Jonathan Edwards</a> among its life members, are the oldest tenants, having used the site since 1956. The stadium has been used as a concert venue by numerous musical artists including <a href="Bon_Jovi" title="wikilink">Bon Jovi</a>, <a href="Bryan_Adams" title="wikilink">Bryan Adams</a> and <a href="Tina_Turner" title="wikilink">Tina Turner</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history-and-development">History and development</h2>
<p>During the 19th century, Felling became an important industrial town in the north east of England. At its north-western fringe, at Felling Shore, two large chemical works opened in 1827 and 1834.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> These initially thrived, but by the early part of the 20th century both were in terminal decline,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and were demolished in 1932 to leave behind a 2-million-tonne heap of spoil.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> This land, approximately  east of the centre of Gateshead,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> was cleared in 1942 but continued to lie derelict until the mid-1950s.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In early 1955, Gateshead Council began work on transforming this land. The Gateshead Youth Stadium, built on the site of the old chemical works, was opened by <a href="Jim_Peters_(athlete)" title="wikilink">Jim Peters</a> on 27 August 1955.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Costing &lt;U+00A3&gt;30,000, the original venue contained little more than a cinder running track and an asphalt cycling track, though floodlights and a seating area were added soon after.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> On 1 July 1961, the arena hosted its first major competition&lt;U+2014&gt;the <a href="Vaux_Breweries" title="wikilink">Vaux Breweries</a> International Athletics Meet<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>&lt;U+2014&gt;but according to sportswriter John Gibson, the Youth Stadium remained &quot;little more than a minor track with a tiny grandstand and open terraces&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Gateshead_1975.jpg" title="fig:Aerial photograph of Gateshead and Felling (1975). The rebuilt stadium is prominent (top centre)." alt="Aerial photograph of Gateshead and Felling (1975). The rebuilt stadium is prominent (top centre)." />According to author Thomas Telfer, by the turn of the 1970s, the town of Gateshead was suffering from &quot;the classic symptoms of decay in its inner-city areas&quot;. The response during the 1960s had been a programme of systematic derelict land reclamation and environmental improvement.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> While these measures did not have an immediate positive impact on the perception of the town, Gateshead Council pressed ahead by looking to develop existing infrastructure with a view to overall regeneration.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> One such opportunity was identified at the Gateshead Youth Stadium, where the council believed that investment might raise the region's profile and bring international recognition.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In April 1974, Gateshead Council inaugurated a &quot;Sport and Recreation&quot; department.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In July 1974, the council appointed <a href="Brendan_Foster" title="wikilink">Brendan Foster</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;a former schoolteacher turned athlete and a native of <a href="Tyne_and_Wear" title="wikilink">Tyne and Wear</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;as the Council's sport and recreation manager.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Foster, who according to Gibson became &quot;the father of Gateshead athletics&quot;,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> had been forced to train in <a href="Edinburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edinburgh</a> during 1973 as a result of the poor condition of the Youth Stadium track.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In December 1973, he had been invited to a civic reception to celebrate his breaking of the two-mile world record earlier that year at Crystal Palace. At this reception, Foster was told that a new <a href="all-weather_running_track" title="wikilink">synthetic track</a> was being laid at Gateshead Youth Stadium. His response was a promise that, if the Council was serious, he would run at the stadium and break a world record (Foster later offered an explanation of that promise: &quot;You know how it is when you've had a few drinks—you promise the world!&quot;).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> When the track was laid in early 1974, Foster became convinced of the Council's sincerity.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He was interviewed for the managerial position<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and, upon appointment, became the &quot;driving force&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> behind the programme of improvements to the Youth Stadium, which included the building of the main, covered Tyne and Wear stand in 1981<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and three accompanying stands; the venue was renamed the Gateshead International Stadium.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> This first tranche of improvements cost around &lt;U+00A3&gt;8 million,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and Foster's proposal to commemorate the re-opening with an athletic event was approved, allowing for the first &quot;Gateshead Games&quot; to be held in 1974.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Gateshead_stadium.jpg" title="fig:The Tyne and Wear Stand" alt="The Tyne and Wear Stand" />The success of the first Gateshead Games, and their subsequent annual renewal, raised the profile of the stadium and caused Gateshead Council to further their financial investment. During the 1980s, additions were made to the site infrastructure, including the building of an indoor sports hall, outdoor football pitches and a gymnasium.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In 1989 the running track was again relayed<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and Gateshead confirmed its reputation as a top-class athletics venue by hosting the <a href="European_Cup_(athletics)" title="wikilink">Europa Cup</a> (forerunner to the <a href="European_Team_Championships" title="wikilink">European Team Championships</a>).<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In the 21st century, the site has been the subject of two major re-development projects. The first was completed in 2006, when two artificial outdoor football pitches, indoor athletic training facilities, sports science provisions and conferencing rooms were added at a cost of &lt;U+00A3&gt;15 million.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The revamped stadium, funded by collaboration between <a href="One_NorthEast" title="wikilink">One NorthEast</a>, <a href="Sport_England" title="wikilink">Sport England</a> and <a href="Gateshead_College" title="wikilink">Gateshead College</a> among others, was opened on 12 May 2006 by <a href="Sebastian_Coe" title="wikilink">Sebastian Coe</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>A second tranche of development, undertaken in two stages, was approved in November 2009.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> This included a general refurbishment and improvement of the existing facilities at the stadium, adding cover, better toilet and new refreshment facilities to the exposed East Stand, improving wheelchair access, adding extra catering and conferencing facilities and a new media and management centre.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> This was funded by collaboration between Gateshead Council, local development funds and Gateshead College.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The covering of the 4,000-seat<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> East Stand with a new canopy roof<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> was completed in July 2010, immediately prior to Gateshead hosting a <a href="2010_IAAF_Diamond_League" title="wikilink">Diamond League</a> event.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The second stage of the re-development&lt;U+2014&gt;the building of the corporate and media facilities&lt;U+2014&gt;commenced on 6 September 2010 and was completed on time in summer 2011.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The total cost of the work was estimated to be &lt;U+00A3&gt;7.6 million.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>A third programme of expansion was initially mooted in 2008. The aim of this programme was to expand the stadium into an all-embracing &quot;sports village&quot;,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> replete with an ice rink, indoor golf course, restaurants and shops. Gateshead Council invited tenders in August 2008 from commercial organisations interested in undertaking the development.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> A formal draft development brief was compiled and published in November 2009.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> A report to Council in December 2009 noted that there had been &quot;a reasonable level of interest at the preliminary stage&quot; from private investors, but that only one detailed proposal had been submitted, which had been declined by the Council on financial grounds.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The report also noted concerns that the original centrepiece of the proposed village, the ice rink, may have been deterring investors and that a similar proposal to redevelop land at the <a href="Stadium_of_Light" title="wikilink">Stadium of Light</a> in <a href="Sunderland,_Tyne_and_Wear" title="wikilink">Sunderland</a> was detracting from what councillors had hoped to be a unique feature of the proposed village.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The result was that a fresh proposal was raised to remove the ice rink from the brief in an attempt to &quot;stimulate the market&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> A public consultation was undertaken and in May 2010 the council reported that 327 of the 375 responses received were in favour of the amended proposal.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> As a result, notice was given to developers that the council intended to market the site and ten responses were received.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>The first major athletic event held at the stadium was the Vaux Breweries International Athletics meet in July 1961. According to its sponsors, the highlight of this meet was the team three-mile race, won by the Blackpool and Fylde Athletic club who were awarded a gold tankard as their prize.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Attracted by a prize fund of &lt;U+00A3&gt;500 and the imminent <a href="AAA_Championships" title="wikilink">AAA Championships</a> in London, the event attracted several athletes from New Zealand, including <a href="Athletics_at_the_1960_Summer_Olympics_&lt;U+2013&gt;_Men&#39;s_5000_metres" title="wikilink">reigning 5000m metre Olympic champion</a> <a href="Murray_Halberg" title="wikilink">Murray Halberg</a> and <a href="Peter_Snell" title="wikilink">Peter Snell</a>, the <a href="Athletics_at_the_1960_Summer_Olympics_&lt;U+2013&gt;_Men&#39;s_800_metres" title="wikilink">reigning 800m Olympic champion</a>.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Watched by a capacity crowd of 10,000 spectators, the men won their respective races; Halberg placed first in the <a href="Mile_run" title="wikilink">mile</a> with a time of 4:03:70 and Snell led a <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> one-two in the 880 yard event, finishing ahead of teammate Gary Philpott in 1:50:40.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>When the comprehensive refurbishment of the stadium was completed more than a decade later, Brendan Foster (by this time a Gateshead Council employee) proposed an international athletics meet. On 3 August 1974, the first &quot;Gateshead Games&quot; were staged in front of around 10,000 spectators.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Four weeks before he won the European 3000m title at the <a href="1974_European_Athletics_Championships" title="wikilink">1974 European Athletics Championships</a> in <a href="Rome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rome</a>, Foster kept his earlier promise to run in the men's 3000m and won the race in a new world-record time of 7:35:20. According to journalist John Gibson, Foster's performance gave the meet, broadcast live by <a href="Tyne_Tees_Television" title="wikilink">Tyne Tees Television</a>, &quot;landmark status&quot;.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> A plaque commemorating the record was later placed at the entrance to the stadium.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>The Gateshead Games became an annual event, which gave the stadium credibility as a major sporting venue.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a><a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> In his managerial capacity with Gateshead Council, Foster was increasingly able to attract athletes to the games.

The intervention worked&lt;U+2014&gt;in the end, Foster asked Yifter and his teammates if they would sing the anthem themselves, which they did in the middle of the stadium&lt;U+2014&gt;and Yifter returned to outclass a field including <a href="Steve_Ovett" title="wikilink">Steve Ovett</a> over 5000m.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The track was resurfaced by Regisport in 1982<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> and the venues' profile was further raised in the summer of 1983, when Gateshead-born athlete <a href="Steve_Cram" title="wikilink">Steve Cram</a> faced Sebastian Coe over 800m in the Gateshead Games.
