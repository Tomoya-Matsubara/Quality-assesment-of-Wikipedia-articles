<p><strong>Nikephoros Phokas</strong> (, <em>Nik&lt;U+0113&gt;phoros Ph&lt;U+014D&gt;kas</em>; died 895/6 or ca. 900), usually surnamed <strong>the Elder</strong> to distinguish him from his grandson, Emperor <a href="Nikephoros_II_Phokas" title="wikilink">Nikephoros II Phokas</a>, was one of the most prominent <a href="Byzantine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Byzantine</a> generals of the late 9th century, and the first important member of the <a href="Phokas_(Byzantine_family)" title="wikilink">Phokas family</a>. As a youth he was taken into the personal retinue of Emperor <a href="Basil_I_the_Macedonian" title="wikilink">Basil I the Macedonian</a>, rising quickly to the posts of <em><a href="protostrator" class="uri" title="wikilink">protostrator</a></em> and then governor of <a href="Charsianon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Charsianon</a>, whence he fought with success against the <a href="Abbasid_Caliphate" title="wikilink">Arabs</a>. In ca. 886&lt;U+2013&gt;887 he led a major expedition in <a href="southern_Italy" title="wikilink">southern Italy</a>, where his victories laid the foundation for the <a href="Catepanate_of_Italy" title="wikilink">Byzantine resurgence</a> in the peninsula. After his return, he was raised to the post of <a href="Domestic_of_the_Schools" title="wikilink">Domestic of the Schools</a>, in effect commander-in-chief of the army, which he led with success against the Arabs in the east and the <a href="First_Bulgarian_Empire" title="wikilink">Bulgarians</a> of Tsar <a href="Simeon_I_of_Bulgaria" title="wikilink">Simeon</a> in the <a href="Balkans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Balkans</a>. He died either in 895/6 or, less likely, sometime ca. 900. Contemporaries and later historians lauded him for his military ability and character. Both of his sons later succeeded him as Domestics of the Schools. His grandsons Nikephoros and Leo were likewise distinguished generals, while the former became emperor in 963&lt;U+2013&gt;969, spearheading the recovery of several lost provinces form the Arabs.</p>

<h3 id="early-life-and-career">Early life and career</h3>
<p>Nikephoros was the son of the founder of the <a href="Phokas_(Byzantine_family)" title="wikilink">Phokas family</a>, a man called Phokas, a native of <a href="Cappadocia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cappadocia</a>. During one of the campaigns of Emperor <a href="Basil_I_the_Macedonian" title="wikilink">Basil I the Macedonian</a> (<a href="reign" title="wikilink">reigned</a> 867&lt;U+2013&gt;886) sometime in the 870s (probably ca. 872), Nikephoros' father caught the emperor's attention and was raised to the rank of <em><a href="tourmarches" class="uri" title="wikilink">tourmarches</a></em>. At the same time Nikephoros, still in his youth, was taken into the imperial retinue, and was soon appointed to the guard corps of the <em><a href="manglabitai" class="uri" title="wikilink">manglabitai</a></em>. He possibly participated in Basil's 873 campaign against <a href="Samosata" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samosata</a>.</p>
<p>Shortly after, at any rate before 878, Nikephoros was promoted to the rank of <em><a href="protostrator" class="uri" title="wikilink">protostrator</a></em> and received from the emperor his own palace in the vicinity of the Church of St. Thecla. Eventually he rose to the post of military governor (<em><a href="strategos" class="uri" title="wikilink">strategos</a></em>) of the <a href="Theme_(Byzantine_district)" title="wikilink">theme</a> of <a href="Charsianon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Charsianon</a>, a post from which, according to the continuators of <a href="Georgios_Monachos" title="wikilink">Georgios Monachos</a>, he scored numerous successes against the <a href="Abbasid_Caliphate" title="wikilink">Arabs</a>.</p>

Miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes" alt="Byzantine troops under Nikephoros Phokas capture the town of Amantia in Italy. Miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes" width="250" /> Nikephoros remained in command of Charsianon until his appointment as the commander-in-chief (<em><a href="monostrategos" class="uri" title="wikilink">monostrategos</a></em>, &quot;single-general&quot;) against the Arabs in <a href="southern_Italy" title="wikilink">southern Italy</a>, a post to which he was appointed in late 885, or, according to Shaun Tougher, after the accession of <a href="Leo_VI_the_Wise" title="wikilink">Leo VI the Wise</a> in July 886. His command involved the forces of several western themes (<a href="Thrace_(theme)" title="wikilink">Thrace</a>, <a href="Macedonia_(theme)" title="wikilink">Macedonia</a>, <a href="Cephallenia_(theme)" title="wikilink">Cephallenia</a>, <a href="Longobardia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Longobardia</a> and <a href="Calabria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calabria</a>), and lasted until his recall to <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a>, probably in 887. It is likely, however, that Nikephoros was originally sent to Italy at the head of a picked detachment of troops from Charsianon, which according to <a href="Theophanes_Continuatus" title="wikilink">Theophanes Continuatus</a> was part of an expeditionary force under <a href="Stephen_Maxentios" title="wikilink">Stephen Maxentios</a>. It was then probably after Maxentios' failure and recall that he was appointed as his successor. Theophanes Continuatus also reports that Nikephoros received further reinforcements from the themes of <a href="Asia_Minor" title="wikilink">Asia Minor</a>, including a <a href="Paulician" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paulician</a> detachment.</p>
<p>According to the Byzantine sources, during his tenure in Italy Nikephoros recovered numerous towns taken by the Arabs in the previous years, including <a href="Taranto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taranto</a>, <a href="Bari" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bari</a>, <a href="Santa_Severina" title="wikilink">Santa Severina</a>, <a href="Rhegion" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rhegion</a> and <a href="Taormina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taormina</a>, Tropai and especially <a href="Amantea" title="wikilink">Amantia</a>, which Maxentios had previously attacked without success. According to the continuators of Georgios Monachos, he was besieging Amantia when news came of Emperor Basil's death and his own recall by Leo VI; Nikephoros kept the news a secret until he had persuaded the Arab garrison to surrender on guarantee of safe passage. During his time in Italy he also took steps to strengthen the Byzantine position by settling many <a href="Armenians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Armenians</a> in the region, as well as 1,000 manumitted slaves donated by Emperor Basil's old benefactor, the widow <a href="Danielis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danielis</a>. The 11th-century historian <a href="John_Skylitzes" title="wikilink">John Skylitzes</a> furthermore reports that Nikephoros brought an end to abuse against the local population, by ending the practice of returning Byzantine soldiers carrying off local Italians to be sold off in the East as slaves. According to Skylitzes, the grateful Italians dedicated a church in his honour.</p>
<h3 id="domestic-of-the-schools-and-the-war-with-bulgaria">Domestic of the Schools and the war with Bulgaria</h3>
<p>His successes in Italy secured Nikephoros a friendly welcome and honours on his return to <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a>, but he is not mentioned again for several years, until the <a href="Byzantine&lt;U+2013&gt;Bulgarian_war_of_894&lt;U+2013&gt;896" title="wikilink">outbreak of war</a> with <a href="First_Bulgarian_Empire" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a> in 894. In the meantime, he was raised to the rank of <em><a href="patrikios" class="uri" title="wikilink">patrikios</a></em> and named to the post of <a href="Domestic_of_the_Schools" title="wikilink">Domestic of the Schools</a>, in effect commander-in-chief of the <a href="Byzantine_army" title="wikilink">Byzantine army</a>, after the death of his predecessor, <a href="Andrew_the_Scythian" title="wikilink">Andrew the Scythian</a>.</p>
<p>In 895, he was sent against the Bulgarians at the head of a large army. It is unclear whether Nikephoros engaged the Bulgarians in battle, for a Byzantine-instigated invasion by the <a href="Magyars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Magyars</a> from the north, and the activities of the <a href="Byzantine_navy" title="wikilink">Byzantine navy</a> in the <a href="Danube" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danube</a>, forced the Bulgarian ruler <a href="Simeon_I_of_Bulgaria" title="wikilink">Simeon</a> to ask for a truce, and the Byzantines withdrew.</p>
<p>This is the last campaign associated with Nikephoros Phokas, and <a href="Symeon_the_Metaphrast" title="wikilink">Symeon Logothetes</a> reports that he died in 895/6. His death reportedly encouraged Tsar Simeon to reopen hostilities, with <a href="Battle_of_Boulgarophygon" title="wikilink">devastating success</a> against Nikephoros' successor as Domestic, <a href="Leo_Katakalon" title="wikilink">Leo Katakalon</a>. The later chronicle of Theophanes Continuatus, however, reports a different story, according to which Nikephoros was disgraced and dismissed from his post after refusing proposals for a marriage alliance with Leo's powerful chief minister, <a href="Stylianos_Zaoutzes" title="wikilink">Stylianos Zaoutzes</a>. After a period out of office, Nikephoros was then appointed <em>strategos</em> either of Charsianon or of the <a href="Thracesian_Theme" title="wikilink">Thracesian Theme</a>, spending his remaining years, until his death around 900, fighting against the Arabs. Leo VI's <em><a href="Tactica_of_Emperor_Leo_VI_the_Wise" title="wikilink">Tactica</a></em> and the later <em><a href="De_velitatione" title="wikilink">De velitatione</a></em> further mention a successful raid into the Arab lands of <a href="Cilicia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cilicia</a> led by Nikephoros, in retaliation of an Arab attack on the fortress of <a href="Mistheia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mistheia</a> in the <a href="Anatolic_Theme" title="wikilink">Anatolic Theme</a>. While directing the <em>strategoi</em> of the Anatolics and of the <a href="Opsician_Theme" title="wikilink">Opsician Theme</a> to deal with the Arab invasion, Nikephoros led his forces to raid the vicinity of <a href="Adana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adana</a>, making many prisoners, and confounded the Arabs by following a different course on his return, thereby avoiding the Arab army sent to block his retreat. This undated raid probably took place either in the years before or directly after the Bulgarian war.</p>
<p>No definite conclusion as to the date of Nikephoros' death can be reached today, but most modern scholars, such as Jean-Claude Cheynet, are doubtful of the version of Theophanes Continuatus. It would have been very unusual for a former Domestic to be appointed to the subordinate position of a thematic <em>strategos</em>, and there is reason to doubt the authenticity of the tale of Zaoutzes' seeing in Nikephoros a potential future emperor and offering the hand of an&lt;U+2014&gt;otherwise unknown&lt;U+2014&gt;daughter in marriage.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-and-family">Assessment and family</h3>
<p>By all accounts, Nikephoros Phokas was a capable soldier. Leo VI lauds his military talents in his <em>Tactica</em>, and he is credited with the invention of a weapon to counter cavalry during his campaign against the Bulgarians, consisting of a sharpened stake driven into the ground. Skylitzes assesses him as a &quot;brave and prudent man, pious towards God and just towards men&quot;.</p>
<p>Nikephoros was the father of <a href="Bardas_Phokas_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Bardas Phokas the Elder</a> and <a href="Leo_Phokas_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Leo Phokas the Elder</a>, both of whom became Domestics of the Schools. So did his grandsons through Bardas, Nikephoros and <a href="Leo_Phokas_the_Younger" title="wikilink">Leo Phokas the Younger</a>, with the first becoming emperor as <a href="Nikephoros_II_Phokas" title="wikilink">Nikephoros II</a> in 963&lt;U+2013&gt;969. Both Leo and Nikephoros II scored major successes against the Arabs, with Nikephoros in particular leading the recovery of <a href="Crete" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crete</a>, <a href="Cyprus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cyprus</a>, <a href="Cilicia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cilicia</a> and <a href="Antioch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antioch</a>.</p>
