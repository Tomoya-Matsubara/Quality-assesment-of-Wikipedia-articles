<p>In Yichang, local hydroelectricity and tourism construction are developing rapidly. There is a long history of the culture of famous people and folk custom; there is a rich resource of traditional Chinese medicine and ecological environment. All of these provide superior conditions for the university to carry out education and scientific research, to develop characteristic disciplines and special fields of study. The campus now occupies 200 hectares, and the total building area comprises 830,000m2. The libraries contain close to 2,000,000 volumes. The whole value of teaching equipment is nearly 100 million Yuan.</p>
<p>CTGU actively grasps the opportunities of the state's opening and development, and carries out the strategy of enhancing science and education to help the country prosper. It has also taken advantage of scientific personnel so as to serve the state's key projects and local economic development. In recent years, CTGU has undertaken and completed over 100 research studies at the state or provincial level, including the state&lt;U+2019&gt;s key tasks, such as the China Natural Scientific Fund, the State Electric Power Corporation and the Huo Yingdong Fund. The university has achieved a group of international first class scientific achievements, and in particular has made important contributions to the construction of the Three Gorges Project and the Qingjiang Valley development project</p>
<p>The newly merged CTGU, which is involved in the great reforms of nationwide universities, aims at running &quot;the nationwide provincial first-class comprehensive university, famous both at home and abroad&quot; and &quot;having a foothold in Yichang, fusing into the Three Gorges Area, contributing to Hubei Province, gearing to the needs of the whole country, and going into the world&quot;. CTGU puts the stress on the construction of key subjects, emphasizes the strength of in hydroelectric engineering and the Three Gorges Culture, develops the education of postgraduates, and improves the level of teaching and scientific research to run the university well. In 2010, CTGU will recruit 24,500 full-time students, including postgraduates and overseas students, and build a group of key subjects and key labs at the provincial level. CTGU will be built into a new university town full of the flavour of the age, with distinctive features of hydroelectric engineering and the Three Gorges Culture, first-class architecture and facilities and an excellent environment.</p>
<p>Among the universities outside <a href="Wuhan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wuhan</a>, the capital of <a href="Hubei" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hubei</a>, CTGU is the largest comprehensive university under the Hubei Provincial Government.

CTGU has 1,337 full-time teachers, including more than 575 professors and associate professors, more than 404 teachers who have a Doctoral Degree or Masters Degree, and over 30 teachers who are young scientific and technical experts who greatly contribute and enjoy the government allowance of the State Council. There is also 1 Chutian scholar, and 3 Sanxia scholars, 24 teachers as provincial cross-century discipline forerunners and academic backbones and 94 teachers as university discipline forerunners and academic backbones.

<p>By 2010, CTGU will recruit over 30,000 full-time undergraduates, postgraduate and foreign students, and institute a group of key subjects (key laboratories) at the provincial and state level, and doctoral and master programs. We firmly believe that in the near future, CTGU will be built into a new university town, full of the flavor of a new century, with the distinctive features of hydroelectric engineering and the Three Gorges culture, first-class architecture and facilities, and an excellent environment.</p>
