<p><strong><em>Diana</em></strong> was a BBC TV series first broadcast in 1984 and adapted from two books by <a href="R._F._Delderfield" title="wikilink">R. F. Delderfield</a>. The adaptation was by the prolific <a href="Andrew_Davies_(writer)" title="wikilink">Andrew Davies</a>.</p>
<p>It follows the intersecting but very different lives of Jan, a poor but studious young country lad and Diana, the equally single minded daughter of a rich landowner, from the 1920s through to post-war Britain. The early story revolves around the class mismatch between the pair; the besotted Jan attempts to elevate his status through hard work and the more aloof Diana attempts to keep her affections in check and pursue her own goals.</p>
<p>Unusually, despite a generally warm reception and a host of stars – including a young <a href="Patsy_Kensit" title="wikilink">Patsy Kensit</a> – it has never been repeated on the BBC and has never been made available for purchase.</p>
