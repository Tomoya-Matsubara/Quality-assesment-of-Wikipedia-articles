<p><strong>Duncan Edwards</strong> (1 October 1936 &lt;U+2013&gt; 21 February 1958) was an <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> <a href="Association_football" title="wikilink">footballer</a> who played for <a href="Manchester_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Manchester United</a> and <a href="England_national_football_team" title="wikilink">the England national team</a>. He was one of the <a href="Busby_Babes" title="wikilink">Busby Babes</a>, the young United team formed under manager <a href="Matt_Busby" title="wikilink">Matt Busby</a> in the mid 1950s, and one of eight players who died as a result of the <a href="Munich_air_disaster" title="wikilink">Munich air disaster</a>.</p>
<p>Born in <a href="Dudley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dudley</a>, Edwards signed for Manchester United as a teenager and went on to become the youngest player to play in the <a href="Football_League_First_Division" title="wikilink">Football League First Division</a> and the then youngest England player since the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>. In a professional career of less than five years he helped United to win two <a href="the_Football_League" title="wikilink">Football League</a> championships and reach the semi-finals of the <a href="UEFA_Champions_League" title="wikilink">European Cup</a>. Although he survived the crash of the team's aeroplane at <a href="Munich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Munich</a> in February 1958, he died as a result of his injuries 15 days later.</p>

<p>Edwards was born on 1 October 1936 at a house on Malvern Crescent in the <a href="Woodside,_Dudley" title="wikilink">Woodside</a> district of <a href="Dudley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dudley</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> which at the time was part of the county of <a href="Worcestershire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Worcestershire</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He was the first child of Gladstone and Sarah Anne Edwards and their only child to survive to adulthood, his younger sister Carol Anne dying in 1947 at the age of 14 weeks.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The family later moved to 31 Elm Road on the <a href="Priory_Estate" title="wikilink">Priory Estate</a>, also in Dudley. Edwards attended Priory Primary School from 1941 to 1948, and Wolverhampton Street Secondary School from 1948 to 1952.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He played football for his school as well as for Dudley Schools, Worcestershire and Birmingham and District teams,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and also represented his school at <a href="morris_dancing" title="wikilink">morris dancing</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He was selected to compete in the National Morris and Sword Dancing Festival, but was also offered a trial for the <a href="English_Schools_Football_Association" title="wikilink">English Schools Football Association</a>'s under-14 team, which fell on the same day, and opted to attend the latter.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Edwards impressed the selectors and was chosen to play for the English Schools XI, making his debut against the equivalent team from <a href="Wales" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wales</a> at <a href="Wembley_Stadium_(1923)" title="wikilink">Wembley Stadium</a> on 1 April 1950. He was soon appointed captain of the team, a position he held for two seasons.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> By this stage he had already attracted the attention of major clubs, with <a href="Manchester_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Manchester United</a> scout Jack O'Brien reporting back to manager <a href="Matt_Busby" title="wikilink">Matt Busby</a> in 1948 that he had &quot;today seen a 12-year-old schoolboy who merits special watching. His name is Duncan Edwards, of Dudley&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Joe_Mercer" title="wikilink">Joe Mercer</a>, who was then coaching the England schools team, urged Busby to sign Edwards, who was also attracting interest from <a href="Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C." title="wikilink">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> and <a href="Aston_Villa_F.C." title="wikilink">Aston Villa</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Edwards signed for United as an amateur on 2 June 1952,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> but accounts of when he signed his first professional contract vary. Some reports state that it occurred on his 17th birthday in October 1953,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> but others contend that it took place a year earlier.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Those accounts that favour the earlier date usually state that a club official, either Busby himself or coach <a href="Bert_Whalley" title="wikilink">Bert Whalley</a>, arrived at the Edwards family home soon after midnight to secure the youngster's signature as early as possible, but other reports claim that this occurred when he signed his amateur contract.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Wolves manager <a href="Stan_Cullis" title="wikilink">Stan Cullis</a> was indignant at missing out on a highly touted local youngster and accused United of improperly offering financial inducements to Edwards or his family, but Edwards maintained that he had always wanted to play for the <a href="Lancashire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lancashire</a> team.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> To guard against the possibility that he might not make a success of his football career, he also began an apprenticeship as a <a href="carpenter" class="uri" title="wikilink">carpenter</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="football-career">Football career</h3>
<p>Edwards began his Manchester United career in the youth team and made several appearances for the team that won the first ever <a href="FA_Youth_Cup" title="wikilink">FA Youth Cup</a> in 1953,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> but by the time of the final had already made his debut for the first team. On 4 April 1953 he played in a <a href="Football_League_First_Division" title="wikilink">Football League First Division</a> match against <a href="Cardiff_City_F.C." title="wikilink">Cardiff City</a>, which United lost 4&lt;U+2013&gt;1,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> aged just 16 years and 185 days, making him the youngest player ever to play in the top division.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Mindful of the fact that his team contained a large number of relatively old players, Busby was keen to bring new young players through the ranks, and Edwards, along with the likes of <a href="Dennis_Viollet" title="wikilink">Dennis Viollet</a> and <a href="Jackie_Blanchflower" title="wikilink">Jackie Blanchflower</a>, was among a number of youngsters introduced to the team during 1953, who came to be known collectively as the <a href="Busby_Babes" title="wikilink">Busby Babes</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Reviewing his performance on his first team debut the <em><a href="The_Guardian" title="wikilink">Manchester Guardian</a></em> newspaper commented that &quot;he showed promise of fine ability in passing and shooting, but will have to move faster as a wing half&quot;.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="1953&lt;U+2013&gt;54_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1953&lt;U+2013&gt;54</a> season saw Edwards emerge as a regular in the United first team.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> After impressing in a friendly against <a href="Kilmarnock_F.C." title="wikilink">Kilmarnock</a> he replaced the injured <a href="Henry_Cockburn_(footballer)" title="wikilink">Henry Cockburn</a> for the away match against <a href="Huddersfield_Town_F.C." title="wikilink">Huddersfield Town</a> on 31 October 1953,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and went on to appear in 24 league matches as well as United's <a href="FA_Cup" title="wikilink">FA Cup</a> defeat to <a href="Burnley_F.C." title="wikilink">Burnley</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Nonetheless he was also still an active part of the youth team and played in the team which won the Youth Cup for the second consecutive season.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> He made his first appearance for the national under-23 team on 20 January 1954 in <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and was considered for inclusion in the <a href="England_national_football_team" title="wikilink">full England team</a>, but on the day when the selection committee watched him in action, against <a href="Arsenal_F.C." title="wikilink">Arsenal</a> on 27 March, he gave a poor performance and was not called up.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>The following season he made 36 first team appearances and scored his first senior goals, finishing the season with six to his name.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> His performances revived calls for him to be selected for the senior England team, and a member of the selection committee was despatched to watch him play against <a href="Huddersfield_Town_F.C." title="wikilink">Huddersfield Town</a> on 18 September 1954, but nothing came of it in the short term,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> although he was selected for a Football League XI which played an exhibition match against a <a href="Scottish_League" title="wikilink">Scottish League</a> team.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In March he played for <a href="England_B_national_football_team" title="wikilink">England B</a> against an equivalent team from <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a> and, despite being criticised in the press for his &quot;poor showing&quot;,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> was called up for the full national team a week later. He made his debut in a match against <a href="Scotland_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Scotland</a> on 2 April 1955 in the <a href="British_Home_Championship" title="wikilink">British Home Championship</a> aged 18 years and 183 days, making him England's youngest debutant since the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, a record which stood until <a href="Michael_Owen" title="wikilink">Michael Owen</a> made his England debut in 1998.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Three weeks later, United took advantage of the fact that he was still eligible for the youth team to select him for the club's third consecutive FA Youth Cup final. The decision to field an England international player in the youth team was heavily criticised, and Matt Busby was forced to pen a newspaper article defending Edwards' selection, which paid off for United as the player was instrumental in a third Youth Cup win.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>In May 1955 Edwards was selected for the England squad which travelled to mainland <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a> for matches against <a href="France_national_football_team" title="wikilink">France</a>, <a href="Portugal_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Portugal</a> and <a href="Spain_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Spain</a>, starting all three matches.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Upon returning from the tour, he began a two-year stint in the <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a> with the <a href="Royal_Army_Ordnance_Corps" title="wikilink">Royal Army Ordnance Corps</a>.
