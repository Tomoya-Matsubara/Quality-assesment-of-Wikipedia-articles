<p><img src="Midland_to_Manchester.jpg" title="fig:Midland Railway lines in Manchester" alt="Midland Railway lines in Manchester" /> In 1880 the <a href="Midland_Railway" title="wikilink">Midland Railway</a> opened the new <a href="Template:Manchester_Lines_South" title="wikilink">Manchester South District line</a> which ran from <a href="Manchester_Central_railway_station" title="wikilink">Manchester Central Station</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The line was later operated by the <a href="Cheshire_Lines_Committee" title="wikilink">Cheshire Lines Committee</a>. Under <a href="British_Rail" title="wikilink">British Rail</a> operation, the line closed in 1967 as part of the <a href="Beeching_Axe" title="wikilink">Beeching Axe</a>.</p>
<p>Plans to re-open the line for light rail use have been proposed since the early 1980s,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> but these proposals failed several times due to problems securing funding.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Revised plans put forward in 2006 only allowed for the line to be opened as far as <a href="St._Werburgh&#39;s_Road_Metrolink_station" title="wikilink">St. Werburgh's Road</a> in Chorlton.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2009, following the failure of the <a href="Greater_Manchester_Transport_Innovation_Fund" title="wikilink">Greater Manchester Transport Innovation Fund</a>, revised transport funding was announced by the <a href="United_Kingdom_Government" title="wikilink">Govenment</a> which would facilitate a major expansion of the Metrolink network, including the re-opening of the former Midland line and stations as far as <a href="East_Didsbury_railway_station" title="wikilink">East Didsbury</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> </p>

<p>It is now planned to re-open the former CLC line after the junction with the <a href="Manchester,_South_Junction_and_Altrincham_Railway" title="wikilink">Altrincham line</a> at <a href="Trafford_Bar_Metrolink_station" title="wikilink">Trafford Bar</a>, and to run a light rail service from East Didsbury, through Burton Road, into Manchester.</p>
<p>Burton Road station will be a newly-constructed stop on the South Manchester line, rather than a re-opened station. Passengers will be able to travel by rail bewteen Manchester and East Didsbury for the first time since the line was closed in 1967.</p>
<p>The date for the station's opening has not been confirmed as yet, but it will be post 2011.</p>
