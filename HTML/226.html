<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p><strong>Courtland Hector Hoppin</strong> was born March 12, 1906, the only child of Dorothy Rockhill and Joseph Clark Hoppin. His was a family of wealth and prestige. His paternal grandfather, for whom he was named, was owner of a vast <a href="Connecticut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Connecticut</a> estate with a manor house known as &quot;Courtlands&quot;. This estate in <a href="Pomfret,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">Pomfret, Connecticut</a>, became a private boarding school (the <a href="Pomfret_School" title="wikilink">Pomfret School</a>) and the Hoppin family is known to have owned much of what is part of the <a href="Pomfret_Street_Historic_District" title="wikilink">Pomfret Street Historic District</a>. Courtland Hoppin the elder (1834--1876) was a physician and practitioner of <a href="homeopathy" class="uri" title="wikilink">homeopathy</a>. Courtland the younger was called by his middle name, Hector, and some of his surviving artwork is signed simply &quot;Hector&quot;. Hector's maternal grandfather, <a href="William_Woodville_Rockhill" title="wikilink">William Woodville Rockhill</a>, was a diplomat<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and considered the first Westerner to gain audience with the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>Hector Hoppin was educated at the Pomfret School, <a href="Harvard_University" title="wikilink">Harvard University</a> and the <a href="University_of_Cambridge" title="wikilink">University of Cambridge</a> in <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, where he obtained his Master's Degree. He subsequently studied art in <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a> and served as Art Director of <a href="London_Films" title="wikilink">London Films</a> until the outbreak of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. Following the war, he studied with <a href="psychologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychologist</a> <a href="Carl_Jung" title="wikilink">Carl Jung</a> in <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a>, and worked in the area of <a href="clinical_psychology" title="wikilink">clinical psychology</a> in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> during the 1950s.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1948, Hector Hoppin published <em>The Psychology of the Artist</em>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He retired to <a href="Lido_Key" title="wikilink">Lido Key</a> in <a href="Sarasota,_Florida" title="wikilink">Sarasota, Florida</a> in 1958, where he and his wife Marion were benefactors of <a href="New_College_of_Florida" title="wikilink">New College of Florida</a>, including the endowment of a chair in <a href="Asian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asian</a> Studies.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>While living in Paris in the 1930s, Hoppin collaborated on several animated films with print-maker and painter <a href="Anthony_Gross" title="wikilink">Anthony Gross</a>, providing his skill as an artist and photographer as well as the capital for the projects. The first animated film of the company they titled &quot;HG Productions&quot; was <em>Une Journ&lt;U+00E9&gt;e en Afrique</em>. Completed in 1932, it was followed by <em>Les Fun&lt;U+00E9&gt;railles</em> and, in 1934, with their most popular and successful work, <em>La Joie de Vivre</em>. Hoppin and Gross hired Hungarian composer <a href="Tibor_Harsanyi" title="wikilink">Tibor Harsanyi</a> to compose music for the sound track of the film. <em>La Joie de Vivre</em> is described as a break from the &quot;limiting comic tradition of the 1930s cartoon animation&quot;, and its free, decorative style and vague politics permitted its re-release in France during the early 1940s by the Vichy government.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <img src="Girls_in_la_joie_de_vivre_c.1934.jpg" title="fig:Joyous Dancers in La Joie de Vivre" alt="Joyous Dancers in La Joie de Vivre" /> </p>
<p>The nine-minute film is described in the Internet Movie Database<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>as &quot;A tone poem [in which] two woodland sprites dance about, atop power lines and among flowers and leaves, while being pursued. Everyone spends some time pulling levers to switch trains, too.&quot; <img src="Hector_Hoppin_1961.jpg" title="fig:C.H. Hoppin in his Sarasota, Florida, home, December 1961" alt="C.H. Hoppin in his Sarasota, Florida, home, December 1961" /></p>
<p>Following the success of this film, the pair produced works titled <em>The Storm</em> and <em>Fox Hunt</em>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><em>Fox Hunt</em> received praise for its use of color &quot;with freedom and beauty quite outside Mr. Disney's picture-book range.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In 1938, Hoppin and Gross began their most ambitious work, <em>Around the World in Eighty Days</em>, a color feature based on the <a href="Jules_Verne" title="wikilink">Jules Verne</a> novel financed by <a href="Alexander_Korda" title="wikilink">Alexander Korda</a> of London Films. The project, however, was interrupted by World War II; all traces of the film were thought to have been lost, but in 1956 some negatives were discovered in a projection room at the National Film Theatre in London and efforts were made to piece-together a portion of the original work. The restored section has a running-time of eighteen minutes.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<dd>''&quot;A reel of negatives from the London lab of <a href="Technicolor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Technicolor</a> was all that remained. With the assistance of the <a href="British_Film_Institute" title="wikilink">British Film Institute</a>'s Experimental Production Fund, contributing some transitional scenes-- such as animated diagrams of the voyage through the Suez Canal-- it was possible to construct a usable, coherent, even vivacious film of great beauty. Hoppin &amp; Gross were innovators. Only the informed eye of a painter could have chosen the colour-pallet;the characters are intelligently animated, caricatured with distinction. Of all the film projects that year arising from producers keen to follow the success of Disney's Snow White, <em>Around The Word In 80 Days</em> shines like a beacon turned towards the future. Despite some technical weaknesses and its truncated form, the film is a substantial achievement.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>
