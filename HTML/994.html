<p><a href="Dom_(title)" title="wikilink">Dom</a> <strong>Pedro II</strong> (English: Peter<em> </em>II; 2 December 1825 – 5 December 1891), nicknamed &quot;the <a href="Magnanimity" title="wikilink">Magnanimous</a>&quot;, was the <a href="List_of_monarchs_of_Brazil" title="wikilink">second and last</a> ruler of the <a href="Empire_of_Brazil" title="wikilink">Empire of Brazil</a>, reigning for over 58 years. Born in <a href="Rio_de_Janeiro" title="wikilink">Rio de Janeiro</a>, he was the seventh child of Emperor Dom <a href="Pedro&amp;nbsp;I_of_Brazil" title="wikilink">Pedro&amp;nbsp;I of Brazil</a> and Empress Dona <a href="Maria_Leopoldina_of_Austria" title="wikilink">Maria Leopoldina</a> and thus a member of the Brazilian branch of the <a href="House_of_Braganza" title="wikilink">House of Braganza</a>. His father's abrupt abdication and flight to Europe in 1831 left a five-year-old Pedro II as Emperor and led to a grim and lonely childhood and adolescence. Obliged to spend his time studying in preparation for rule, he knew only brief moments of happiness and encountered few friends of his age. His experiences with court intrigues and political disputes during this period greatly affected his later character. Pedro II grew into a man with a strong sense of duty and devotion toward his country and his people. On the other hand, he increasingly resented his role as monarch.</p>
<p>Inheriting an Empire on the verge of disintegration, Pedro II turned <a href="Portuguese_language" title="wikilink">Portuguese</a>-speaking <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a> into an emerging power in the international arena. The nation grew to be distinguished from its <a href="Hispanic_America" title="wikilink">Hispanic neighbors</a> on account of its political stability, zealously guarded freedom of speech, respect for civil rights, vibrant economic growth and especially for its form of government: a functional, <a href="Constitutional_monarchy" title="wikilink">representative parliamentary monarchy</a>. Brazil was also victorious in three international conflicts (the <a href="Platine_War" title="wikilink">Platine War</a>, the <a href="Uruguayan_War" title="wikilink">Uruguayan War</a> and the <a href="Paraguayan_War" title="wikilink">Paraguayan War</a>) under his rule, as well as prevailing in several other international disputes and domestic tensions. Pedro II steadfastly pushed through the abolition of slavery despite opposition from powerful political and economic interests. A savant in his own right, the Emperor established a reputation as a vigorous sponsor of learning, culture and the sciences. He won the respect and admiration of scholars such as <a href="Charles_Darwin" title="wikilink">Charles Darwin</a>, <a href="Victor_Hugo" title="wikilink">Victor Hugo</a> and <a href="Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="wikilink">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, and was a friend to <a href="Richard_Wagner" title="wikilink">Richard Wagner</a>, <a href="Louis_Pasteur" title="wikilink">Louis Pasteur</a> and <a href="Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow" title="wikilink">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Although there was no desire for a change in the form of government among most <a href="Brazilian_people" title="wikilink">Brazilians</a>, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of <a href="republic" class="uri" title="wikilink">republic</a> headed by a <a href="Dictatorship" title="wikilink">dictator</a>. Pedro II had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He allowed no prevention of his ouster and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent the last two years of his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.</p>
<p>The reign of Pedro II thus came to an unusual end&lt;U+2014&gt;he was overthrown while highly regarded by the people and at the pinnacle of his popularity, and some of his accomplishments were soon brought to naught as Brazil slipped into a long period of weak governments, dictatorships, and constitutional and economic crises. The men who had exiled him soon began to see in him a model for the Brazilian republic. A few decades after his death, his reputation was restored and his remains were returned to Brazil with celebrations nationwide. Historians have regarded the Emperor in an extremely positive light and several have ranked him as the greatest Brazilian.</p>

Empress Maria Leopoldina died on 11 December 1826, a few days after a stillbirth, when Pedro was a year old. Two and a half years later, his father married <a href="Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie_of_Leuchtenberg" title="wikilink">Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie of Leuchtenberg</a>.

The first was <a href="Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Bonif&lt;U+00E1&gt;cio_de_Andrada" title="wikilink">Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Bonif&lt;U+00E1&gt;cio de Andrada</a>, his friend and an influential leader during <a href="Independence_of_Brazil" title="wikilink">Brazilian independence</a>, who was named guardian. The second was Mariana de Verna, who had held the post of <em>aia</em> (<a href="governess" class="uri" title="wikilink">governess</a>) since the birth of Pedro II. As a child, the then-Prince Imperial called her &quot;<em>Dadama</em>&quot;, as he could not pronounce the word <em>dama</em> (<a href="Lady" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lady</a>) correctly. He regarded her as his surrogate mother, and would continue to call her by her nickname well into adulthood out of affection. The third person was Rafael, an <a href="Afro-Brazilian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afro-Brazilian</a> veteran of the <a href="Cisplatine_War" title="wikilink">Cisplatine War</a>. He was an employee in the Palace of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Crist&lt;U+00F3&gt;v&lt;U+00E3&gt;o whom Pedro I deeply trusted and asked to look after his son&lt;U+2014&gt;a charge which he carried out during the rest of his life.</p>

<li><p>.</ref> However, the hours of study were strenuous and the preparation for his role as monarch was demanding. He had few friends of his age and limited contact with his sisters.

They accepted Pedro II as an authority figure whose presence was indispensable for the country's survival.&quot; When asked by politicians if he would like to assume full powers, Pedro II shyly accepted.<ref>See:</p></li>

Pedro II was seen nationwide as a legitimate source of authority, whose position placed him above partisanship and petty disputes. He was, however, still no more than a boy, and a shy, insecure and immature one. His nature resulted from his broken childhood, when he experienced abandonment, intrigue and betrayal. Behind the scenes, a group of high ranking palace servants and notable politicians led by <a href="Aureliano_Coutinho,_Viscount_of_Sepetiba" title="wikilink">Aureliano Coutinho</a> (later Viscount of Sepetiba) became known as the &quot;Courtier Faction&quot; as they established influence over the young Emperor. Some were very close to him, such as Mariana de Verna and Steward <a href="Paulo_Barbosa_da_Silva" title="wikilink">Paulo Barbosa da Silva</a>. Pedro II was deftly used by the Courtiers against their actual or suspected foes.</p>

<p>In late 1845 and early 1846 the Emperor made a tour of Brazil's southern provinces, traveling through <a href="S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Paulo" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo</a> (of which <a href="Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt;_(state)" title="wikilink">Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt;</a> was a part at this time), <a href="Santa_Catarina_(state)" title="wikilink">Santa Catarina</a> and <a href="Rio_Grande_do_Sul" title="wikilink">Rio Grande do Sul</a>. He was buoyed by the warm and enthusiastic responses he received. By then Pedro II had matured physically and mentally. He grew into a man who, at  tall with blue eyes and blond hair,<ref>See:</p>

<li><p>.</ref> With growth, his weaknesses faded and his strengths of character came to the fore. He became self-assured and learned to be not only impartial and diligent, but also courteous, patient and personable. Barman said that he kept &quot;his emotions under iron discipline. He was never rude and never lost his temper. He was exceptionally discreet in words and cautious in action.&quot; Most importantly, this period saw the end of the Courtier Faction. Pedro II began to fully exercise authority and successfully engineered the end of the courtiers' influence by removing them from his inner circle while avoiding any public disruption.</p></li>

<h3 id="abolition-of-slave-trade-and-war">Abolition of slave trade and war</h3>
<p><img src="Pedro_II_of_Brazil_1848.jpg" title="fig:Pedro II around age 22, c. 1848. This is the earliest surviving photograph of the Emperor" alt="Pedro II around age 22, c. 1848. This is the earliest surviving photograph of the Emperor" width="200" /> Pedro II was faced by three crises between 1848 and 1852. The first test came in confronting the trade in illegally imported slaves. This had been banned in 1826 as part of a treaty with <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Great Britain</a>. Trafficking continued unabated, however, and the British government's passage of the <a href="Aberdeen_Act" title="wikilink">Aberdeen Act</a> of 1845 authorized British warships to board Brazilian shipping and seize any found involved in the slave trade. While Brazil grappled with this problem, the <a href="Praieira_revolt" title="wikilink">Praieira revolt</a> erupted on 6 November 1848. This was a conflict between local political factions within <a href="Pernambuco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pernambuco</a> province; it was suppressed by March 1849. The <a href="Eus&lt;U+00E9&gt;bio_de_Queir&lt;U+00F3&gt;s_Law" title="wikilink">Eus&lt;U+00E9&gt;bio de Queir&lt;U+00F3&gt;s Law</a> was <a href="Promulgation" title="wikilink">promulgated</a> on 4 September 1850 which gave the Brazilian government broad authority to combat the illegal slave trade. With this new tool, Brazil moved to eliminate importation of slaves. By 1852 this first crisis was over, and Britain accepted that the trade had been suppressed.</p>
<p>The third crisis entailed a conflict with the <a href="Argentine_Confederation" title="wikilink">Argentine Confederation</a> regarding ascendancy over territories adjacent to the <a href="R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o_de_la_Plata" title="wikilink">R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o de la Plata</a> and free navigation of that waterway. Since the 1830s, Argentine dictator <a href="Juan_Manuel_de_Rosas" title="wikilink">Juan Manuel de Rosas</a> had supported rebellions within <a href="Uruguay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uruguay</a> and Brazil. It was only in 1850 that Brazil was able to address the threat posed by Rosas. An alliance was forged between Brazil, Uruguay and disaffected Argentines, leading to the <a href="Platine_War" title="wikilink">Platine War</a> and the subsequent overthrow of the Argentine ruler in February 1852. Barman said that a &quot;considerable portion of the credit must be ... assigned to the Emperor, whose cool head, tenacity of purpose, and sense of what was feasible proved indispensable.&quot;</p>
<p>The Empire's successful navigation of these crises considerably enhanced the nation's stability and prestige, and Brazil emerged as a hemispheric power. Internationally, Europeans began to regard the country as embodying familiar liberal ideals, such as freedom of the press and constitutional respect for civil liberties. Its representative parliamentary monarchy also stood in stark contrast to the mix of dictatorships and instability endemic in the other nations of South America during this period.<ref>See:</p>

Under the prime ministry of <a href="Hon&lt;U+00F3&gt;rio_Hermeto_Carneiro_Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o,_Marquis_of_Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt;" title="wikilink">Hon&lt;U+00F3&gt;rio Hermeto Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o</a> (then-Viscount and later Marquis of Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt;) the Emperor advanced his own ambitious program: the <em>concilia&lt;U+00E7&gt;&lt;U+00E3&gt;o</em> (conciliation) and <em>melhoramentos</em> (material developments). Pedro II's reforms aimed to promote less political partisanhip, and forward infrastructure and economic development. The nation was being interconnected through <a href="railroad" class="uri" title="wikilink">railroad</a>, electric <a href="telegraph" class="uri" title="wikilink">telegraph</a> and <a href="steamship" class="uri" title="wikilink">steamship</a> lines, uniting it into a single entity. The general opinion, both at home and abroad, was that these accomplishments had been possible due to Brazil's &quot;governance as a <a href="monarchy" class="uri" title="wikilink">monarchy</a> and the character of Pedro II&quot;.</p>
<p>Pedro II was neither a British-style <a href="figurehead" class="uri" title="wikilink">figurehead</a> nor an autocrat in the manner of <a href="List_of_Russian_rulers" title="wikilink">Russian czars</a>. The Emperor exercised power through cooperation with elected politicians, economic interests, and popular support. The active presence of Pedro II on the political scene was an important part of the government's structure, which also included the cabinet, the <a href="Chamber_of_Deputies_of_Brazil" title="wikilink">Chamber of Deputies</a> and the <a href="Senate_of_Brazil" title="wikilink">Senate</a> (the latter two formed the General Assembly). He used his participation in directing the course of government as a means of influence. His direction became indispensable, although it never devolved into &quot;one-man rule.&quot; In his handling of the political parties, he &quot;needed to maintain a reputation for impartiality, work in accord with the popular mood, and avoid any flagrant imposition of his will on the political scene.&quot;</p>
<p>The Emperor's more notable political successes were achieved primarily because of the non-confrontational and cooperative manner with which he approached both issues and the partisan figures with whom he had to deal. He was remarkably tolerant, seldom taking offense at criticism, opposition or even incompetence. He did not have the constitutional authority to force acceptance of his initiatives without support, and his collaborative approach towards governing kept the nation progressing and enabled the political system to successfully function. The Emperor respected the prerogatives of the legislature, even when they resisted, delayed, or thwarted his goals and appointments. Most politicians appreciated and supported his role. Many had lived through the regency period, when the lack of an emperor who could stand above petty and special interests led to years of strife between political factions. Their experiences in public life had created a conviction that Pedro II was &quot;indispensable to Brazil's continued peace and prosperity.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="domestic-life">Domestic life</h3>

With maturity, patience and their first child, <a href="Afonso,_Prince_Imperial_of_Brazil" title="wikilink">Afonso</a>, their relationship improved. Later Teresa Cristina gave birth to more children: <a href="Isabel,_Princess_Imperial_of_Brazil" title="wikilink">Isabel</a>, in 1846; <a href="Princess_Leopoldina_of_Brazil" title="wikilink">Leopoldina</a>, in 1847; and lastly, <a href="Pedro,_Prince_Imperial_of_Brazil" title="wikilink">Pedro</a>, in 1848.<ref>See:</p>

<li><p>.</ref> Beyond suffering as a father, his view of the Empire's future changed completely. Despite his affection for his daughters, he did not believe that Princess Isabel, although his heir, would have any chance of prospering on the throne. He felt his successor needed to be male for the monarchy to be viable. He increasingly saw the imperial system as being tied so inextricably to himself, that it would not survive him. Isabel and her sister received a remarkable education, although they were given no preparation for governing the nation. Pedro II excluded Isabel from participation in government business and decisions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometime around 1850, Pedro II began having discreet affairs with other women. The most famous and enduring of these relationships involved <a href="Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;sa_de_Barros,_Countess_of_Barral" title="wikilink">Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;sa Margarida Portugal de Barros, Countess of Barral</a>, with whom he formed a romantic and intimate, though not adulterous, friendship after she was appointed governess to the emperor's daughters in November 1856.<ref>See:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>.</ref> Throughout his life, the Emperor held onto a hope of finding a soulmate, something he felt cheated of due to the necessity of a <a href="marriage_of_state" title="wikilink">marriage of state</a> to a woman for whom he never felt passion. This is but one instance illustrating his dual identity: one who assiduously carried out his duty in the role of emperor which destiny had assigned to him and another who considered the imperial office an unrewarding burden and who was happier in the worlds of literature and science.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Pedro II was hard-working and his routine was demanding. He usually woke up at 07:00 and did not sleep before 02:00 in the morning. His entire day was devoted to the affairs of state and the meager free time available was spent reading and studying. The Emperor went about his daily routine dressed in a simple black tail coat, trousers, and cravat. For special occasions he would wear court dress, and he only appeared in full regalia with <a href="Imperial_Regalia_of_Brazil" title="wikilink">crown, mantle and scepter</a> twice each year at the opening and closing of the General Assembly. Pedro II held politicians and government officials to the strict standards which he exemplified. The Emperor adopted a strict policy for the selection of civil servants based on morality and merit. To set the standard, he lived simply,<ref>See:</p>

Another means of monitoring the Empire was through direct contacts with his subjects. One opportunity for this was during regular Tuesday and Saturday public audiences, where anyone of any social class (including slaves) could gain admittance and present their petitions and stories.

<p>Aware of the anarchy in Rio Grande do Sul and the incapacity and incompetence of its military chiefs to resist the Paraguayan army, Pedro II decided to go to the front in person. Upon receiving objections from the cabinet, the General Assembly and the <a href="Privy_council" title="wikilink">Council of State</a>, Pedro II pronounced: &quot;If they can prevent me from going as an Emperor, they cannot prevent me from abdicating and going as a Fatherland Volunteer&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;an allusion to those Brazilians who volunteered to go to war and became known throughout the nation as the &quot;Fatherland Volunteers&quot;.<ref>See:</p>

During this period, Pedro II's time and energy were devoted to the war effort. He tirelessly worked to raise and equip troops to reinforce the front lines and to push forward the fitting of new warships for the navy. The rape of women, widespread violence against civilians, ransacking and destruction of properties that had occurred during Paraguay's invasion of Brazilian territory had made a deep impression on him. He warned the Countess of Barral in November 1866 that &quot;the war should be concluded as honor demands, cost what it cost.&quot; &quot;Difficulties, setbacks, and war weariness had no effect on his quiet resolve&quot;, said Barman. Mounting casualties did not distract him from advancing what he saw as Brazil's righteous cause, and he stood prepared to personally sacrifice his own throne to gain an honorable outcome. Writing in his journal a few years previously Pedro II remarked: &quot;What sort of fear could I have? That they take the government from me? Many better kings than I have lost it, and to me it is no more than the weight of a cross which it is my duty to carry.&quot;</p>
<p>At the same time, Pedro II worked to prevent quarrels between the national political parties from impairing the military response. The Emperor prevailed over a <a href="1868_Brazilian_political_crisis" title="wikilink">serious political crisis in July 1868</a> resulting from a quarrel between the cabinet and <a href="Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s_Alves_de_Lima_e_Silva,_Duke_of_Caxias" title="wikilink">Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves de Lima e Silva</a> (then-Marques and later Duke of Caxias), the commander-in-chief of the Brazilian forces in Paraguay. Caxias was also a politician and was a member of the opposing party to the ministry. The Emperor sided with him, leading to the cabinet's resignation. As Pedro II maneuvered to bring about a victorious outcome in the conflict with Paraguay, he threw his support behind the political parties and factions that seemed to be most useful in the effort. The reputation of the monarchy was harmed and its trusted position as an impartial mediator was severely impacted in the long term. He was unconcerned for his personal position, and regardless of the impact upon the imperial system, he determined to put the national interest ahead of any potential harm caused by such expediencies.</p>
<p>His refusal to accept anything short of total victory was pivotal in the final outcome. His tenacity was well-paid with the news that L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez had died in battle on 1 March 1870, bringing the war to a close. Pedro II turned down the General Assembly's suggestion to erect an <a href="equestrian_statue" title="wikilink">equestrian statue</a> of him to commemorate the victory and chose instead to use the money to build elementary schools.<ref>See:</p>

Brazil's international reputation for political stability and investment potential greatly improved. The Empire was seen as a modern and progressive nation unequalled, with the exception of the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, in the <a href="Americas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Americas</a>. The economy began growing rapidly and immigration flourished. Railroad, shipping and other modernization projects were adopted. With &quot;slavery destined for extinction and other reforms projected, the prospects for 'moral and material advances' seemed vast.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1870, few Brazilians opposed slavery and even fewer openly condemned it. Pedro II, who did not own slaves, was one of the few who did oppose slavery.<ref>See:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>.</ref> Its abolition was a delicate subject. Slaves were used by everyone, from the richest to the poorest. Pedro II wanted to end the practice gradually to soften the impact to the national economy.<ref>See:</p></li>
<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>.</ref> With no constitutional authority to directly intervene to abolish slavery, the Emperor would need to use all his skills to convince, influence and gather support among politicians to achieve his goal. His first open move occurred back in 1850, when he threatened to abdicate unless the General Assembly declared the <a href="Atlantic_slave_trade" title="wikilink">Atlantic slave trade</a> illegal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After the overseas source for supplying new slaves had been eliminated, Pedro II turned his attention in the early 1860s to removing the remaining source: enslavement of children born to slaves. Legislation was drafted at his initiative, but the conflict with Paraguay delayed discussion of the proposal in the General Assembly.<ref>See:</p>

<li><p>.</ref> Pedro II openly asked for the gradual eradication of slavery in the <a href="Speech_from_the_Throne" title="wikilink">Speech from the Throne</a> of 1867. He was heavily criticized, and his move was condemned as &quot;national suicide.&quot;<ref>See:</p></li>
<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>.</ref> Critics argued &quot;that abolition was his personal desire and not that of the nation.&quot; He consciously ignored the growing political damage to his image and to the monarchy in consequence of his support for abolition.

He had long desired to vacation abroad. When news arrived that his younger daughter, the 23-year-old Lepoldina, had died in Vienna of <a href="typhoid_fever" title="wikilink">typhoid fever</a> on 7 February, he finally had a pressing reason to venture outside the Empire.<ref>See:</p>

<p>The Emperor proceeded to visit Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Italy, Egypt, Greece, Switzerland and France.

He spent his days sightseeing and conversing with scientists and other intellectuals with whom he shared interests. The European sojourn proved to be a success, and his demeanor and curiosity won respectful notices in the nations which he visited. The prestige of both Brazil and Pedro II were further enhanced during the tour when news came from Brazil that the Law of Free Birth, abolishing the last source of enslavement, had been ratified. The imperial party returned to Brazil in triumph on 31 March 1872.</p>

<p><img src="Delfim-pedroII-MHN.jpg" title="fig:Pedro II at age 49, 1875" alt="Pedro II at age 49, 1875" width="200" /> Soon after returning to Brazil, Pedro II was faced with an unexpected crisis. The Brazilian clergy had long been understaffed, undisciplined and poorly educated, leading to a great loss of respect for the Catholic Church. The imperial government had embarked upon a program of reform to address these deficiencies. As Catholicism was the state religion, the government exercised a great deal of control over Church affairs, paying clerical salaries, appointing parish priests, nominating bishops, ratifying <a href="papal_bull" title="wikilink">papal bulls</a> and overseeing seminaries. In pursuing reform, the government selected bishops who satisfied its criteria for education, support for reform and moral fitness. However, as more capable men began to fill the clerical ranks, resentment of government control over the Church increased.</p>
<p>The bishops of <a href="Olinda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Olinda</a> and <a href="Bel&lt;U+00E9&gt;m" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bel&lt;U+00E9&gt;m</a> (in the provinces of Pernambuco and <a href="Par&lt;U+00E1&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Par&lt;U+00E1&gt;</a>, respectively) were two of the new generation of educated, zealous Brazilian clerics. They had been influenced by the <a href="Ultramontanism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ultramontanism</a> which spread among Catholics in this period. In 1872 they ordered <a href="Freemasonry" title="wikilink">Freemasons</a> expelled from <a href="Sodality_(Catholic_Church)" title="wikilink">lay brotherhoods</a>.<ref>See:</p>
<ul>

<li><p>.</ref> While European Masonry often tended towards <a href="atheism" class="uri" title="wikilink">atheism</a> and <a href="anti-clericalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-clericalism</a>, things were much different in Brazil where membership in Masonic orders was common&lt;U+2014&gt;although Pedro II himself was not a Freemason.

This led to their trial and conviction by the <a href="Superior_Court_of_Justice_(Brazil)" title="wikilink">Superior Court of Justice</a>. In 1874 they were sentenced four years at hard labor, although the Emperor commuted this to imprisonment only.<ref>See:</p></li>

He was accompanied by his faithful servant Rafael, who had raised him from childhood. Pedro II arrived in New York City on 15 April 1876, and set out from there to travel throughout the country; going as far as <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a> in the west, <a href="New_Orleans" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a> in the south, <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a>, and north to <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a>, <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>.<ref>See:</p>

</ul>
<p>Pedro II's trips abroad made a deep psychological impact. While traveling, he was largely freed of the restrictions imposed by his office. Under the pseudonym &quot;Pedro de Alc&lt;U+00E2&gt;ntara&quot;, he enjoyed moving about as an ordinary person, even taking a train journey solely with his wife. Only while touring abroad could the Emperor shake off the formal existence and demands of the life he knew in Brazil. It became more difficult to reacclimate to his routine as head of state upon returning. Upon his sons' early deaths, the Emperor's faith in the monarchy's future had evaporated. His trips abroad now made him resentful of the burden destiny had placed upon his shoulders when only a child of five. If he previously had no interest in securing the throne for the next generation, he now had no desire to keep it going during his own lifetime.</p>

<h3 id="decadence">Decadence</h3>
<p><img src="Pedro_II_of_Brazil_Paris_1887.jpg" title="fig:Pedro II at age 61, 1887: an Emperor weary of his crown and resigned to the monarchy&#39;s demise" alt="Pedro II at age 61, 1887: an Emperor weary of his crown and resigned to the monarchy&#39;s demise" width="200" /> During the 1880s, Brazil continued to prosper and social diversity increased markedly, including the first organized push for <a href="women&#39;s_rights" title="wikilink">women's rights</a>. On the other hand, letters written by Pedro II reveal a man grown world-weary with age and having an increasingly alienated and pessimistic outlook. He remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing the tasks demanded of the imperial office, albeit often without enthusiasm. Because of his increasing &quot;indifference towards the fate of the regime&quot; and his lack of action in support of the imperial system once it was challenged, historians have attributed the &quot;prime, perhaps sole, responsibility&quot; for the dissolution of the monarchy to the Emperor himself.</p>
<p>After their experience of the perils and obstacles of government, the political figures who had arisen during the 1830s saw the Emperor as providing a fundamental source of authority essential for governing and for national survival. These elder statesmen began to die off or retire from government until, by the 1880s, they had almost entirely been replaced by a younger generation of politicians who had no experience of the early years of Pedro II's reign, when internal and external dangers threatened the nation's existence. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity. In sharp contrast to those of the previous era, the young politicians saw no reason to uphold and defend the imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation.</p>
<p>To those younger politicians Pedro II was merely an old and increasingly sick man who had steadily eroded his position by taking an active role in politics for decades. Before he had been above criticism, but now his every action and inaction prompted meticulous scrutiny and open criticism. Many young politicians had become apathetic toward the monarchic regime and, when the time came, they would do nothing to defend it. Pedro II's role in achieving an era of national unity, stability and good government now went unremembered and unconsidered by the ruling elites. By his very success, the Emperor had made his position seem unnecessary.</p>
<p>The lack of an heir who could feasibly provide a new direction for the nation also diminished the long-term prospects of the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor loved his daughter Isabel, but he considered the idea of a female successor as antithetical to the role required of Brazil's ruler. He viewed the death of his two sons as being a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted. Resistance to accepting a female ruler was also shared by the political establishment. Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still very traditional, and only a male successor was thought capable as head of state.</p>

While in <a href="Milan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Milan</a> he passed two weeks between life and death, even being <a href="Anointing_of_the_Sick_(Catholic_Church)" title="wikilink">anointed</a>.<ref>See:</p>

From the capital, from the provinces, from everywhere, arrived proofs of affection and veneration.&quot; With the devotion expressed by Brazilians upon the return of the Emperor and the Empress from Europe, the <a href="monarchy" class="uri" title="wikilink">monarchy</a> seemed to enjoy unshakable support and to be at the height of its popularity.<ref>See:</p></li>

<p>The nation enjoyed great international prestige during the final years of the Empire, and it had become an <a href="Emerging_Powers" title="wikilink">emerging power</a> within the international arena. Predictions of economic and labor disruption caused by the abolition of slavery failed to materialize and the 1888 coffee harvest was successful. The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to <a href="republicanism" class="uri" title="wikilink">republicanism</a> by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country.<ref>See:</p>

</ul>
<p>Although there was no desire in Brazil among the majority of the population to change the <a href="form_of_government" title="wikilink">form of government</a>, the civilian republicans began pressuring army officers to overthrow the monarchy. They launched a <a href="coup_d&#39;&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat" title="wikilink">coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat</a>, arrested Prime Minister <a href="Afonso_Celso,_Viscount_of_Ouro_Preto" title="wikilink">Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto</a> and instituted the republic on 15 November 1889.<ref>See:</p>

Pedro's last couple of years were lonely and melancholic, as he lived in modest hotels without money and writing in his journal of dreams in which he was allowed to return to Brazil.<ref>See:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>.</ref> On 9 December, thousands of mourners attended the ceremony at La Madeleine. Aside from Pedro II's family, these included: <a href="Francis_II_of_the_Two_Sicilies" title="wikilink">Francesco II</a>, former king of the Two Sicilies; <a href="Isabella_II_of_Spain" title="wikilink">Isabel II</a>, former queen of Spain; <a href="Philippe,_comte_de_Paris" title="wikilink">Philippe, comte de Paris</a>; and other members of European royalty. Also present were General <a href="Joseph_Brug&lt;U+00E8&gt;re" title="wikilink">Joseph Brug&lt;U+00E8&gt;re</a>, representing President <a href="Marie_Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois_Sadi_Carnot" title="wikilink">Sadi Carnot</a>; the presidents of the <a href="Senate_of_France" title="wikilink">Senate</a> and the <a href="Chamber_of_Deputies_of_France" title="wikilink">Chamber of Deputies</a> as well as their members; diplomats; and other representatives of the French government. Nearly all members of the <a href="Institut_de_France" title="wikilink">Institut de France</a> were in attendance. Other governments from the Americas and Europe sent representatives, as did distant countries such as <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Turkey</a>, <a href="Qing_Dynasty" title="wikilink">China</a>, <a href="Empire_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Japan</a> and <a href="Persia_under_Qajar_dynasty" title="wikilink">Persia</a>. Following the services, the coffin was taken in procession to the train station to begin its trip to Portugal. Around 300,000 people lined the route despite the incessant rain and cold. The journey continued on to the <a href="Monastery_of_S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Vicente_de_Fora" title="wikilink">Church of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Vicente de Fora</a> near <a href="Lisbon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lisbon</a>, where the body of Pedro II was interred in the <a href="Royal_Pantheon_of_the_House_of_Braganza" title="wikilink">Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza</a> on 12 December.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Brazilian republican government, &quot;fearful of a backlash resulting from the death of the Emperor&quot;, banned any official reaction. Nevertheless, the Brazilians were far from indifferent to Pedro II's demise, and &quot;repercussions in Brazil were also immense, despite the government's effort to suppress. There were demonstrations of sorrow throughout the country: shuttered business activity, flags displayed at half-staff, black armbands on clothes, death knells, religious ceremonies.&quot; Masses were held in memory of Pedro II throughout Brazil, and he and the monarchy were praised in the eulogies that followed.</p>
<h3 id="legacy">Legacy</h3>

<p><img src="Petropolis-Cathedral4.jpg" title="fig:Tomb of Pedro II and Teresa Cristina within the Cathedral of Petr&lt;U+00F3&gt;polis" alt="Tomb of Pedro II and Teresa Cristina within the Cathedral of Petr&lt;U+00F3&gt;polis" width="250" /> After his fall, Brazilians remained attached to the former Emperor, who was still a popular and highly praised figure. This view was even stronger among those <a href="Afro-Brazilian" title="wikilink">of African descent</a>, who equated the monarchy with freedom because of his and his daughter Isabel's part in the abolition of slavery. The continued support for the deposed monarch is largely credited to a generally held and unextinguished belief that he was a truly &quot;wise, benevolent, austere and honest ruler&quot;, said historian Ricardo Salles. The positive view of Pedro II, and nostalgia for his reign, only grew as the nation quickly fell into a series of economic and political crises which Brazilians attributed to the Emperor's overthrow.</p>
<p>Strong feelings of guilt manifested among republicans, and these became increasingly evident upon the Emperor's death in exile. They praised Pedro II, who was seen as a model of <a href="Res_publica" title="wikilink">republican ideals</a>, and the imperial era, which they believed should be regarded as an example to be followed by the young republic. In Brazil, the news of the Emperor's death &quot;aroused a genuine sense of regret among those who, without sympathy for a restoration, acknowledged both the merits and the achievements of their deceased ruler.&quot; His remains, as well as those of his wife, were returned to Brazil in 1921 in time for the centenary of the Brazilian independence. The government granted Pedro II dignities befitting a head of state. A national holiday was declared and the return of the Emperor as a national hero was celebrated throughout the country. Thousands attended the main ceremony in <a href="Rio_de_Janeiro" title="wikilink">Rio de Janeiro</a> where, according to historian Pedro Calmon, the &quot;elderly people cried. Many knelt down. All clapped hands. There was no distinction between republicans and monarchists. They were all Brazilians.&quot; This homage marked the reconciliation of Republican Brazil with its monarchical past.</p>
<p>Historians have expressed high regard for Pedro II and his reign. The scholarly literature dealing with him is vast and, with the exception of the period immediately after his ouster, overwhelmingly positive, and even laudatory. He has been regarded by several historians in Brazil as the greatest Brazilian. In a manner similar to methods which were used by republicans, historians point to the Emperor's virtues as an example to be followed, although none go so far as to advocate a restoration of the monarchy. Historian Richard Graham noted that &quot;[m]ost twentieth-century historians, moreover, have looked back on the period [of Pedro II's reign] nostalgically, using their descriptions of the Empire to criticize&lt;U+2014&gt;sometimes subtly, sometimes not&lt;U+2014&gt;Brazil's subsequent republican or dictatorial regimes.&quot;</p>
