<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>In a bowling alley, ex-convict Carl Nearman (<a href="J._R._Bourne" title="wikilink">J. R. Bourne</a>) watches another man eat his meal before following him outside, where he approaches and kills him. Elsewhere, Annie Tisman (Donna White) receives a human tongue in a package. The <a href="Millennium_Group" title="wikilink">Millennium Group</a> sends offender profiler <a href="Frank_Black_(character)" title="wikilink">Frank Black</a> (<a href="Lance_Henriksen" title="wikilink">Lance Henriksen</a>) and pathologist Cheryl Andrews (<a href="C._C._H._Pounder" title="wikilink">C. C. H. Pounder</a>) to investigate, as several people have received body parts in the post over the past few years. No connection between the recipients has been found, nor have the bodies the parts have been culled from.</p>
<p>Mike Bardale (<a href="John_Hawkes_(actor)" title="wikilink">John Hawkes</a>) is a violent recidivist who has recently been released from prison again. He is approached by a man calling himself The Judge (<a href="Marshall_Bell" title="wikilink">Marshall Bell</a>), who offers Bardale a position in his &quot;court&quot;. The Judge is a vigilante, hiring convicts to mete out his version of justice against those he perceives as criminals. Bardale's first &quot;execution&quot; is that of his forebear, Nearman.</p>
<p>The body of the man killed outside the bowling alley is discovered, missing a tongue. It is identified as a retired police officer, Detective Mellen, who had given false testimony that had sent Annie Tisman's late husband to prison. Black realizes that the killer is motivated by the need to right wrongs such as this, killing those who have gotten away with crimes. Meanwhile, The Judge passes sentence on another victim&lt;U+2014&gt;a <a href="slumlord" class="uri" title="wikilink">slumlord</a> whose negligence caused a tenant's death. Bardale is ordered to cut the landlord's leg off while he is still alive; the leg is later found in a postal depot in a package.</p>
<p>Forensic evidence on the package eventually leads to Bardale, and then to The Judge. The Judge is arrested for questioning, and knowing that there is not enough evidence to warrant sentencing him, he offers Black a job with him. Black refuses, but The Judge is released. Bardale is incensed that The Judge has manipulated the law to his own ends, and passes sentence on him for hypocrisy. Finding Bardale alone in a farmhouse, Black discovers that the convict had fed The Judge to his pigs.</p>

Both <em>Millennium</em> and <em>Moby-Dick</em> have been described as &quot;a basic conflict between good and evil&quot;. In addition, both are &quot;focused on a then-modern view of the world&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Todd VanDerWerff on the character of Catherine Black.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>}}</p>
<p>&quot;The Judge&quot; was first broadcast on the <a href="Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">Fox Network</a> on November 15, 1996;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and earned a <a href="Nielsen_rating" title="wikilink">Nielsen rating</a> of 7.6, meaning that roughly  of all television-equipped households were tuned in to the episode.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;The Judge&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book <em>Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium &amp; The Lone Gunmen</em>, rated the episode one star out of five, finding its &quot;contrived&quot; plot to be &quot;barely a subtle premise&quot;, and noting that &quot;the script unfortunately elevates the lead villain to <a href="Camp_(style)" title="wikilink">high camp</a>&quot;. Shearman and Pearson felt that the subject of vigilantism was a suitable one for the series, and that it had &quot;been bubbling under the surface every since the concept of the Millennium Group ... was first mentioned&quot;; however, they ultimately felt that the episode contained &quot;very little to engage the brain&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Bill Gibron, writing for <a href="DVD_Talk" title="wikilink">DVD Talk</a>, rated &quot;The Judge&quot; 4 out of 5, describing it as being &quot;a fine, moody episode&quot;. However, Gibron felt that Marshall Bell's character may have been better suited to a recurring role, rather than being killed off during the episode.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Writing for <em><a href="The_A.V._Club" title="wikilink">The A.V. Club</a></em>, Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B-, praising the acting of both Bell and John Hawkes. However, VanDerWerff felt that &quot;The Judge&quot; showed <em>Millennium</em> to be struggling with its own concept, growing &quot;staid&quot; as a result of only having &quot;the one color to play with&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
