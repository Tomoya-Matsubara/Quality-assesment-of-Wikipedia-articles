<p><strong>John Dwight Chesbro</strong> (June 5, 1874 &lt;U+2013&gt; November 6, 1931) was a <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) <a href="pitcher" class="uri" title="wikilink">pitcher</a>. Nicknamed &quot;Happy Jack&quot;, Chesbro played for the <a href="Pittsburgh_Pirates" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> (1899&lt;U+2013&gt;1902), the <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Highlanders</a> (1903&lt;U+2013&gt;1909), and the <a href="Boston_Red_Sox" title="wikilink">Boston Red Sox</a> (1909). Chesbro finished his career with a <a href="Win&lt;U+2013&gt;loss_record_(pitching)" title="wikilink">win-loss record</a> of 198-132, an <a href="earned_run_average" title="wikilink">earned run average</a> of 2.68, and 1,265 <a href="strikeout" title="wikilink">strikeouts</a>. His 41 wins during the 1904 season remains an MLB record for the modern era, and is viewed as unbreakable.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Chesbro was elected to the <a href="National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum" title="wikilink">National Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in 1946 by the <a href="Veterans_Committee" title="wikilink">Veterans Committee</a>, though he had received little consideration from the <a href="Baseball_Writers_Association_of_America" title="wikilink">Baseball Writers Association of America</a> (BBWAA). Some baseball historians consider the 1946 election a mistake, and believe that Chesbro was elected solely on the basis of his 1904 season.</p>
