<p>The first recorded Japanese settler of Enbetsu was Gentar&lt;U+014D&gt; Shirahata, who moved to Enbetsu in 1896. A group of settlers from <a href="Echizen,_Fukui" title="wikilink">Echizen</a>, <a href="Fukui_Prefecture" title="wikilink">Fukui Prefecture</a> called the Echizen Dantai came to Enbetsu in the following year.

Enbetsu, which had previously been part of Teshio, was established as a separate village in 1909. Rice production was tested as early as 1897, specifically with strains of rice from Fukui Prefecture. After testing numerous strains from other parts of <a href="Honshu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Honshu</a>, 1921 saw a successful rice crop in Enbetsu, and the start of an agricultural industry in the village.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
