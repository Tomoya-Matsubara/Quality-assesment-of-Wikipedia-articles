<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The intention of the journal is to attempt &quot;to broaden the scope of anarchist discourse by introducing themes, topics, perspectives and methodologies which have not traditionally been considered relevant to anarchism.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Its features focus on three broad themes: the re-evaluation of anarchist history, with regard to issues of culture, philosophy and political action; the potential future of anarchism as a form of critical political action; and the application of anarchist ideas as an instrument of scholarly research. The journal publishes special issues on topics which have included <a href="Human_sexuality" title="wikilink">sexuality</a>, <a href="science-fiction" class="uri" title="wikilink">science-fiction</a> and &quot;anarchism after <a href="September_11,_2001_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11</a>&quot;, and historical research articles on <a href="Leo_Tolstoy" title="wikilink">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a href="Taoism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taoism</a>, <a href="John_Locke" title="wikilink">John Locke</a> and <a href="post-structuralism" class="uri" title="wikilink">post-structuralism</a>. In the 21st century incarnation, a central focus of the journal has been anarchism's relation to <a href="globalisation" class="uri" title="wikilink">globalisation</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="home-dispute">Home dispute</h2>
<p>The journal had a long-running dispute with <a href="Stewart_Home" title="wikilink">Stewart Home</a> after it published a negative review of his books <em>Neoist Manifestos</em> and <em>The Art Strike Papers</em> and denied Home's request to publish his rebuttal as a matter of policy.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Home alleges that Gemie wrote him a conciliatory letter dated November 14, 1996 in which Gemie promised to include a positive review of Home's <em>What Is Situationism???</em> in the Spring 1997 issue. Home subsequently referred to <em>Anarchist Studies</em> as a &quot;sad and reactionary 'academic' journal&quot; that is &quot;patently unable to engage in &lt;U+2026&gt; critical debate&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
