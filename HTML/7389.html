<p><strong>Virender Sehwag</strong>  () (born 20 October 1978), affectionately known as <em>Viru</em>, the <em>Nawab of Najafgarh</em>, or the <em>Zen master of modern cricket</em>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> is one of the leading <a href="batsman" title="wikilink">batsmen</a> in the <a href="Indian_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Indian cricket team</a>. Sehwag is an aggressive right-handed opening batsman and a part-time right-arm off-spin bowler. He played his first <a href="One_Day_International" title="wikilink">One Day International</a> in 1999 and joined the Indian <a href="Test_cricket" title="wikilink">Test cricket</a> team in 2001. In April 2009, Sehwag became the only Indian to be honoured as the <a href="Wisden_Leading_Cricketer_in_the_World" title="wikilink">Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World</a> for his performance in 2008,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> subsequently becoming the first player of any nationality to retain the award for 2009.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Sehwag created history when he crossed the 200 run mark in ODI's on 8th December, 2011 at Indore. He scored 219 off 149 balls against the West Indies during the 4th ODI of the 5 match series, with a strike rate of 146.97. His score of 219 is the highest score in ODI's. In typical Sehwag fashion, he reached the 200 run mark with a 4. Sehwag has formed a habit of reaching milestones with boundaries.</p>
<p>Sehwag holds multiple records including the highest score made by an Indian in Test cricket (319), which was also the fastest triple <a href="century_(cricket)" title="wikilink">century</a> in the history of international cricket (reached 300 off only 278 balls) as well as the fastest 250 by any batsman (in 207 balls against Sri Lanka on 3 December 2009 at the <a href="Brabourne_Stadium" title="wikilink">Brabourne Stadium</a> in Mumbai). His other innings of 309 and 293 are also the second and third best by any Indian player. Sehwag also holds the distinction of being one of four batsmen in the world to have ever surpassed 300 twice in Test cricket, and the only one to score two triple centuries and take a five-wicket <a href="innings" class="uri" title="wikilink">innings</a> haul.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In March 2009, Sehwag smashed the fastest century ever scored by an Indian in ODI cricket, from 60 balls.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> On 8 December 2011, he hit his maiden double century in ODI cricket, against <a href="West_Indies_cricket_team" title="wikilink">West Indies</a>, becoming the second batsman after <a href="Sachin_Tendulkar" title="wikilink">Sachin Tendulkar</a> to reach the landmark.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> He holds the current record for the highest individual score of 219 off just 149 balls in ODIs.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Sehwag was appointed as vice-captain of the Indian team under <a href="Rahul_Dravid" title="wikilink">Rahul Dravid</a> in October 2005 but due to poor form, he was later replaced by <a href="V._V._S._Laxman" title="wikilink">V. V. S. Laxman</a> in December 2006 as Test vice-captain. In January 2007, Sehwag was dropped from the ODI team and later from the Test team as well.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> During his term as vice-captain, Sehwag skippered the team in place of injured Dravid in 2 ODIs and 1 Test. Following his return to form in 2008 and the retirement of <a href="Anil_Kumble" title="wikilink">Anil Kumble</a>, Sehwag has been reappointed as the vice-captain for both Tests and ODIs. By early 2009, Sehwag had reestablished himself as one of the best performing batsmen in ODI cricket.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-years">Early years</h2>
<p>Sehwag was born in a <a href="Jat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jat</a> family from <a href="Haryana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haryana</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The son of a grain merchant, Sehwag spent his childhood in a bungalow in a <a href="joint_family" title="wikilink">joint family</a>, with siblings, uncles, aunts and sixteen cousins. Though now settled in New Delhi, the Sehwag family hails from Haryana. Sehwag was the third of four children born to father Krishan and mother Krishna Sehwag, with two older sisters Manju and Anju, and younger brother Vinod. His father attributes his interest in cricket to a toy bat which he was given when he was seven months old. He attended Arora Vidya School in Delhi, and pestered his parents to let him play cricket, on the basis that he was not academically gifted.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> His father tried to end his career when he broke a tooth as a child in 1990, but Sehwag evaded the ban with the help of his mother.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Later he attended <a href="Jamia_Milia_Islamia" title="wikilink">Jamia Milia Islamia</a> for graduation.</p>

<h3 id="early-domestic-cricket">Early domestic cricket</h3>
<p>Sehwag made his debut for <a href="Delhi_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Delhi cricket team</a> in first class cricket in the 1997&lt;U+2013&gt;98 season. He was selected to the <a href="North_Zone_cricket_team" title="wikilink">North Zone cricket team</a> for the <a href="Duleep_Trophy" title="wikilink">Duleep Trophy</a> the following 1998&lt;U+2013&gt;99 season, ending fifth in the total runscoring list.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The following year he was fourth on the Duleep Trophy run scoring list, including a 274, the highest score of the competition.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> This was attained against <a href="South_Zone_cricket_team" title="wikilink">South Zone</a> at <a href="Agartala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Agartala</a> in just 327 balls, and followed a rapid 187 from just 175 in a Ranji Trophy match against <a href="Punjab_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Punjab</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> He was then selected for the U-19 team which toured South Africa.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> He was seventh in the 2000&lt;U+2013&gt;01 season with two centuries,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> but his consistency earned the attention of selectors and he became a regular member of the national team in mid 2001.</p>
<p>Since his international career started, he has continued to play for Delhi in the domestic competition whilst he is not occupied with international duty and has captained North Zone to victory in the <a href="Deodhar_Trophy" title="wikilink">Deodhar Trophy</a> in 2004&lt;U+2013&gt;05 and 2005&lt;U+2013&gt;-06.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> He also had a short stint with <a href="Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Leicestershire</a> in county cricket in 2003, but a back injury lead to a mutual termination of the contract.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="odi-career">ODI career</h3>
<p>Sehwag's <a href="One_Day_International" title="wikilink">ODI</a> career started poorly when he scored 1 against <a href="Pakistani_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a> in <a href="Mohali" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mohali</a> in April 1999 when he fell lbw to <a href="Shoaib_Akhtar" title="wikilink">Shoaib Akhtar</a>. His bowling performance was also ineffective and expensive, conceding 35 runs off 3 overs. He did not get another chance in the national team for 20 months.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> <img src="Indiancricketers.jpg" title="fig:Sehwag with teammates Harbhajan Singh (Left) and Yuvraj Singh (Middle)." alt="Sehwag with teammates Harbhajan Singh (Left) and Yuvraj Singh (Middle)." /> Sehwag was not given another match until the home series against <a href="Zimbabwean_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Zimbabwe</a> in December 2000. Sehwag rose to prominence in his fourth ODI match in March 2001 when he scored 58 off 54 balls, against <a href="Australian_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Australia</a> in <a href="Bangalore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bangalore</a>. Combined with his three wickets, he help earn India a victory and was awarded his first man of the match award.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He followed this with an unproductive tour of Zimbabwe in mid 2001.</p>
<p>Sehwag had his international breakthrough in <a href="Sri_Lanka" title="wikilink">Sri Lanka</a> in August 2001 when he was promoted to the opening slot for the tri-series also involving New Zealand. The promotion to open the innings came because regular opener <a href="Sachin_Tendulkar" title="wikilink">Sachin Tendulkar</a> was absent due to a foot injury.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In the match against <a href="New_Zealand_cricket_team" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> that was to decide the finalist, he scored his maiden century from 69 balls.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> At the time, the century was the third fastest ODI century for an Indian behind <a href="Mohammad_Azharuddin" title="wikilink">Mohammad Azharuddin</a>'s 62 ball effort and Yuvraj singh's 64 ball effort. This was his first score beyond 50 in ten matches and saw him named man of the match. This performance earned him a regular spot in the ODI squad in the middle-order. He bettered his own record by hitting a 60-ball century against New Zealand during the 2009 tour. An innings of note in 2002 was the 22 ball half-century against <a href="Kenyan_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Kenya</a> in <a href="Goodyear_Park" title="wikilink">Bloemfontein</a>, tying the second fastest 50 by an Indian. Because of his attacking cricket stroke plays, Sehwag has got many fans, including the WestIndies legend Desmond Haynes, who admitted that he is a great fan of him.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>With Ganguly's injury in the India-England ODI Series in January 2002, Sehwag received another opportunity to open the innings which he seized by scoring 82 from 64 balls in <a href="Kanpur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kanpur</a> in an eight-wicket Indian victory.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> With good performances as opener, Sehwag was made a permanent fixture at the top of the innings. <a href="Sachin_Tendulkar" title="wikilink">Sachin Tendulkar</a>, who opened in the England ODI series, was moved to middle order<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> &lt;U+2013&gt; a strategy that reaped dividends for <a href="Indian_cricket_team" title="wikilink">India</a> in 2002 in ODI matches. In the England series and the preceding tour to South Africa, he compiled 426 runs at 42.6 with four half-centuries .</p>
<p>After modest returns on the tours of the West Indies and England in early and mid 2002, he scored 271 runs at 90.33 in the <a href="2002_ICC_Champions_Trophy" title="wikilink">2002 ICC Champions Trophy</a> in Sri Lanka, with two man of the match performances. After running out <a href="Ian_Blackwell" title="wikilink">Ian Blackwell</a>, he was involved in a 192 run partnership with Ganguly, scoring 126 from 104 balls to help set up an eight wicket victory against England in a group match.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He then scored 58 from 54 balls and took 3/25 including two wickets in the final over to help defeat <a href="South_African_cricket_team" title="wikilink">South Africa</a> by 10 runs<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> to help India progress to the final.</p>
<p>In late 2002 he scored an unbeaten 114 from 82 balls that included a 196 run partnership with Ganguly to lead India to a nine wicket win over the West Indies in <a href="Rajkot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rajkot</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> He was the only batsman to score a century in the 7 match <a href="New_Zealand_cricket_team" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> ODI Series where he made two centuries &lt;U+2013&gt; 108 in Napier<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> in an Indian defeat and 112 in Auckland<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> in a one-wicket victory.</p>
<p>Virender Sehwag had a mediocre <a href="2003_Cricket_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2003 Cricket World Cup</a>, scoring 299 runs at an average of 27, he top scored with 82 in the loss against Australia in the final.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> <img src="Virender_Sehwag_fielding.jpg" title="fig:Sehwag in fielding practice." alt="Sehwag in fielding practice." /> Later in 2003, he scored his fourth century and earned Man of the Match award against New Zealand in <a href="Hyderabad_(India)" title="wikilink">Hyderabad</a>, scoring 130 and putting on a 182 run partnership with Tendulkar, to lay the foundations for a 145 run victory.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> In spite of it, Sehwag struggled for consistency in 2003 and 2003/04 ODI series where he had only one century and 3 fifties, two against minnows &lt;U+2013&gt; <a href="Bangladesh_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Bangladesh</a> and <a href="Zimbabwe_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Zimbabwe</a> and one against <a href="Pakistani_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a>, in 22 matches.</p>
<p>Even with his inconsistent form, he earned 3 MoM awards in 2004/5 and 2004/05 ODI season with one award each against Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan. In the match against Pakistan in <a href="Kochi,_India" title="wikilink">Kochi</a> he scored 108 off 95 balls, his first century in eighteen months which set up a 95 run victory.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Sehwag then started a two year streak without a century in ODIs, as well as having his ODI tour of Pakistan in early 2006 curtailed due to a shoulder injury.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> His drought in limited overs cricket has puzzled cricket experts because of the consistent performances in <a href="Test_Cricket" title="wikilink">Test matches</a> with a high scoring rate has not translated into significant contributions in the ODI format of the game.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Sehwag was dropped from the ODI Squad for the <a href="West_Indian_cricket_team_in_India_in_2006-07" title="wikilink">WI-IND 4 Match ODI series</a>. With debate over whether he deserved to be included in the <a href="2007_Cricket_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2007 Cricket World Cup</a> squad, captain <a href="Rahul_Dravid" title="wikilink">Dravid's</a> insistence on his retention paved the way to being named in the World Cup squad.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> However, despite this assurance, Sehwag's form continued to decline.</p>
<p>Sehwag started the 2007 World Cup in poor form, only being picked for the side because of Rahul Dravid's wishes. He scored poorly in the first group match but bounced back to hit a magnificent 114 from 87 deliveries against lowly ranked Bermuda. The Indian team scored 413&lt;U+2013&gt;5, the highest team total in a World Cup match, and went on to win the match but this was their only win in the tournament.</p>
<p>On 11 March 2009, Sehwag blasted India's fastest ODI hundred against New Zealand by reaching 3 figures in just 60 balls. Eventually, he led India to win its first series win in New Zealand.</p>
<p>In <a href="2011" class="uri" title="wikilink">2011</a>, Sehwag scored his highest ODI score against <a href="West_Indies" title="wikilink">West Indies</a> at <a href="Indore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indore</a>.</p>
<h3 id="odi-summary">ODI summary</h3>
<p>Sehwag's scoring rate is extremely quick, at 103.44 runs per 100 balls (it is exceeded only by one current player: Shahid Afridi, who has a much lower average). He has had more success in run chases, scoring seven of his thirteen centuries while chasing. He has led India on seven occasions, due to the unavailability of the incumbent due to illness, injury or rotation policy. In <a href="December" class="uri" title="wikilink">December</a> 2011 Sehwag scored 219 in 149 deliveries against <a href="West_Indies" title="wikilink">West Indies</a> at <a href="Indore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indore</a>.

<p>Sehwag's maiden century in mid-2001 in Sri Lanka was not enough to gain selection in the Test team for the corresponding series.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Sehwag made his Test debut in late 2001 in the First Test against <a href="South_African_cricket_team" title="wikilink">South Africa</a> in <a href="Bloemfontein" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bloemfontein</a> as a middle-order batsman. He scored 105 on debut despite the South African win.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> He was given a one match suspension by ICC match referee <a href="Mike_Denness" title="wikilink">Mike Denness</a> for overappealing<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> in the Second Test in <a href="Port_Elizabeth" title="wikilink">Port Elizabeth</a>, which lead to political dispute amongst the ICC and the two countries. He returned for the home series in 2001&lt;U+2013&gt;02 against <a href="English_cricket_team" title="wikilink">England</a> and <a href="Zimbabwe_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Zimbabwe</a>. After scoring two half-centuries in the preceding series, he was promoted to a makeshift-opener on the 2002 England tour after the failure of previous openers and an experiment with wicket-keeper <a href="Deep_Dasgupta" title="wikilink">Deep Dasgupta</a>.

He also missed the Second Test against Sri Lanka in <a href="Delhi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Delhi</a> due to illness,<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> but returned to the team in the following match in <a href="Ahmedabad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ahmedabad</a> and captained the Indians to victory whilst <a href="Rahul_Dravid" title="wikilink">Rahul Dravid</a> was ill.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

<p>Sehwag scored his first century in a year when he compiled 254 against Pakistan in the First Test in <a href="Lahore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lahore</a> in January 2006, the highest ever Test score at a strike rate of over 100 and the second fastest double century ever.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> In doing so he was involved in a 410 run partnership with captain Rahul Dravid, the highest ever against Pakistan and in Pakistan, and just four short of a new world record opening partnership in Test matches.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Sehwag went on to lampoon the Pakistani attack led by <a href="Shoaib_Akhtar" title="wikilink">Shoaib Akhtar</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Sehwag however failed to pass 50 in the following two Tests against Pakistan, and aside from a 76* in the Second Test in <a href="Mohali" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mohali</a> against England, fell seven times for less than 20 runs to the new ball , leading criticism of his position in the team.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>During the 2006 West Indies tour, Sehwag narrowly missed out on scoring a century in the opening session of the Second Test in <a href="St_Lucia" title="wikilink">St Lucia</a>, ending with 99 at the interval.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> He went on to compile 180 in just 190 balls, and also collected four wickets for the match to be named man of the match.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Although Sehwag had collected more than 50 wickets in ODIs, he was substantially used as a Test bowler for the first time on the West Indies tour, taking nine wickets in the first two Test matches when he was used in the absence of off-spinner <a href="Harbhajan_Singh" title="wikilink">Harbhajan Singh</a> as India opted to only use one specialist spinner.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> He had previously only three wickets at Test level . He was also fined in the First Test for excessive appealing.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>Poor form saw Sehwag being dropped from the Test team in 2007. In December 2007, he was recalled for India's tour of Australia after being omitted form the list of probables,<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> amid calls for his return by several commentators, most notably <a href="Ian_Chappell" title="wikilink">Ian Chappell</a>. <a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>Though he was omitted from the team for the first two matches, both of which India lost, he was picked for the third Test at the <a href="WACA_Ground" title="wikilink">WACA</a> in <a href="Perth,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Perth</a> after scoring a century in a tour match against the ACT Invitational XI.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> He played a key part in India's victory, making 72 runs at a brisk pace and taking 2 crucial wickets<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> He scored a match-saving 151 in the second innings of the fourth Test in <a href="Adelaide" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adelaide</a>. This was his first century in the second innings of a test match, and was notable in that he rejected his usual, aggressive batting style in favour of a more defensive approach which was the need of the hour.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>Sehwag continued his good form against South Africa, in the home series in April 2008, scoring 319 in the first Test in <a href="Chennai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chennai</a>, having reached 300 off just 278 balls, the fastest triple century in test history. Sehwag became only the third batsman after Sir <a href="Donald_Bradman" title="wikilink">Donald Bradman</a> and <a href="Brian_Lara" title="wikilink">Brian Lara</a> to score 2 triple centuries in Test Cricket. He scored 257 runs the third day of the match, which was the most runs scored by an individual batsman on a single day of a Test match since 1954, when <a href="Dennis_Compton" title="wikilink">Dennis Compton</a> made 273 runs on the second day of the <a href="Nottingham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nottingham</a> Test against Pakistan.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>He has a habit of making big centuries, with his last eleven centuries having all been over 150, including two triple centuries and further three double centuries which surpassed Sir <a href="Donald_Bradman" title="wikilink">Donald Bradman</a>'s record of having seven consecutive centuries beyond 150.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>In the first test against England in Chennai in December 2008, Sehwag's rapid 83 off just 68 balls,<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> in the last session of the fourth day, set India up for its record run-chase of 4/387, the highest successful target on Indian soil. He got the man-of-the-match award despite <a href="Sachin_Tendulkar" title="wikilink">Sachin Tendulkar</a> scoring an unbeaten century later in the same innings and <a href="Andrew_Strauss" title="wikilink">Andrew Strauss</a> scoring a century in each of England's innings.</p>
<p>He has been noted for his record against Pakistan, averaging over 90 against and in Pakistan, scoring four centuries against India's arch rivals. The disparity in his average in the first and second innings is often noted, being 68 and 25 and all but one of his fifteen Test centuries having come in the first innings.</p>
<p>During Sri Lanka's tour of India in 2009, in the 3-match test series he finished with the highest run getter of the series with 491 runs. In the last test match, he made 293 with the help of which India won the test match. In this innings he established many records: 1. Scoring the second fastest 200. 2. Scoring the fastest 250 off just 207 balls. 3. Third highest run scorer on a single day. [284 n.o] He missed accomplishing the feat of being the only player to score three triple centuries. He was caught and bowled by Murlitharan short by just seven runs. This innings, which consisted of 40 fours and 7 sixes, was described as his third best by him after his two triple centuries.</p>

<h2 id="playing-style">Playing style</h2>
<p><img src="Virender_Sehwag_batting_2.jpg" title="fig:Sehwag batting in the nets|left" alt="Sehwag batting in the nets|left" /> Sehwag was often compared to <a href="Sachin_Tendulkar" title="wikilink">Sachin Tendulkar</a> in his early days due to the similar batting style, build and appearance.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> He has acknowledged numerous times that he consciously attempted to model his playing style on Tendulkar's in his youth.</p>
<p>Sehwag's technique is often cited as being particularly unorthodox, often backing away (considered technically incorrect) to free his arms whilst playing his shots, in particular to cut or drive spinners inside out. He is frequently cited by commentators for his extremely strong (physically) square cutting and upper cutting and power through the off-side.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> He is also an excellent player of the late cut. In particular, his tendency to strike the ball in the air and risk dismissal is a trait which has seen him noted for his chancy and adventurous mindset.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> He is also noted for a relative lack of footwork,<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> with his timing often attributed to his eyesight. Of late, Sehwag has shown a proclivity to be dismissed by <a href="inswing" class="uri" title="wikilink">inswing</a> deliveries, something attributed to his leaden-footed batting style. He has also got dismissed playing the cut shot when the ball was too close to his body to cut, especially in limited over matches.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>Virender Sehwag is often noted for his extremely attacking style of batting, and in 2005 he was described by <em>Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</em> as the &quot;most exciting opener in the world&quot;<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> due to his aggressive style in <a href="Test_Cricket" title="wikilink">Test matches</a>, his strike rate being inferior only to that of <a href="Adam_Gilchrist" title="wikilink">Adam Gilchrist</a> and <a href="Shahid_Afridi" title="wikilink">Shahid Afridi</a>. Sehwag has also been noted for his apparent disregard for the match situation, exhibited by aggressive batting even when his team is in a poor position or after being out-manoeuvred by the bowler in the recent past.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> This is a two-edged sword, as it allows him to not be psychologically hindered by previous failures, but can also lead to excessive aggression.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> He was quoted by Pakistan coach <a href="Bob_Woolmer" title="wikilink">Bob Woolmer</a> as a sophisticated slogger.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> But over the years, his style has changed from &quot;reckless hitting&quot; to that of &quot;controlled aggression&quot;, according to an article in the <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em>. Previously Sehwag was known predominantly as an offside player, with a weakness against straight short pitched bowling. However in the last two years he has improved his leg side and bouncer hitting considerably. This is shown in the recent ODIs against New Zealand where he utilised the pull, hook and flick shots to devastating effect.</p>
<p>As of 15 March 2010, Sehwag has an average of nearly 68 in the first innings of test matches where he has scored 5130 runs, 18 centuries and 12 fifties in 76 matches. In the second innings, his average drops to 31 and has scored 1561 runs, an only century and 9 fifties in 54 innings. The first and second innings difference of 37 runs is one of the highest and indicates a lack of ability in dealing with more difficult batting conditions as the pitch deteriorates. However, his match-saving second-innings 151 against Australia at Adelaide during the 2007&lt;U+2013&gt;08 Border-Gavaskar series, and a match winning 92 in trying situations at Nagpur during the 2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09 series, went a long way towards repairing that image. In the 2008 Test series against England, Sehwag played a key role in the fourth innings of the first Test in Chennai. He amassed 83 runs in 68 balls, which helped India chase down an improbable target of 387 with six wickets to spare. This was the highest successful run chase in India, and the fourth highest in Test history. For this effort, Sehwag was adjudged Man of the Match. On 12 August 2011, Sehwag became only the third Indian in history to achieve a king pair (2 golden ducks consecutively) and the 15th player to do that of all time, but weeks later he again scored crucial and agressive pair of 55 against West Indies.</p>
<h2 id="controversy">Controversy</h2>

<p>In November 2001, Sehwag was involved in controversy in the Second <a href="Test_Cricket" title="wikilink">Test match</a> between <a href="Indian_cricket_team" title="wikilink">India</a> and <a href="South_African_cricket_team" title="wikilink">South Africa</a> at <a href="Sahara_Oval_St_George&#39;s" title="wikilink">St George's Park</a>, <a href="Port_Elizabeth" title="wikilink">Port Elizabeth</a>, when he was given a one Test ban for &quot;excessive appealing&quot; by ICC Match referee <a href="Mike_Denness" title="wikilink">Mike Denness</a>. He was one of six Indian players to receive bans, four of which were suspended bans. The unprecedented severity of the bans precipitated an international cricketing, political and administrative crisis, with the Indian cricket establishment threatening to call off the tour unless Mike Denness was removed as match referee from the third test match. <a href="International_Cricket_Council" title="wikilink">ICC</a> backed Mike Denness<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> and the South African board backed the Indian cricket establishment<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> and did not allow Mike Denness to enter the stadium<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> on the first day of the third test match. ICC declared that the match was 'unofficial' and 'friendly five day match'<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> and the series was officially declared as a 2 match series and South Africa as 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 winners. The subsequent <a href="England_cricket_team" title="wikilink">England</a> tour to <a href="Indian_cricket_team" title="wikilink">India</a> was placed in jeopardy when India picked Sehwag in the test squad.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Subsequent to this development, ICC issued a warning that any match with Sehwag in the cricket team will not be considered an &quot;official&quot; Test match until Sehwag had served his one match ban.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> After negotiations with ECB and ICC and in general interest of cricket, Sehwag was dropped from the team for the first Test against England.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>

A lifelong vegetarian, Sehwag owns a vegetarian eatery, <em>Sehwag Favourites</em>, which opened in late 2005 at the Fun Republic cineplex in Delhi, following in the footsteps of his role model Sachin Tendulkar. The majority of the products on the menu are named after cricketing themes related to his memorable innings, such as <em>Multan Ke Sultan Ki Tikdi</em>, meaning dish for three persons, which alludes to his triple century in Multan and is priced at 309 rupees. There are plans to expand the chain across India with a second outlet already planned in <a href="Ludhiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ludhiana</a>.
