<p><strong>Peter of Canterbury</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> or <strong>Petrus</strong><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> (died c. 607 AD or after 614) was a <a href="Benedictine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Benedictine</a> abbot and companion of <a href="Augustine_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Augustine</a> in the <a href="Gregorian_mission" title="wikilink">Gregorian mission</a> to England. He became the first abbot of what would become <a href="St_Augustine&#39;s_Abbey" title="wikilink">St Augustine's Abbey</a>. Augustine sent Peter as an emissary to Rome around 600 to convey news of the mission to <a href="Pope_Gregory_I" title="wikilink">Pope Gregory I</a>. Peter's death has traditionally been dated to around 607, but evidence suggests that he was present at a church council in Paris in 614, so he probably died after that date.</p>
<h2 id="life">Life</h2>
<p>It is presumed that Peter was a native of Italy, like the other members of the Gregorian mission.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This mission was dispatched by <a href="Pope_Gregory_the_Great" title="wikilink">Pope Gregory the Great</a> in 596 to proselytize the Anglo-Saxons in England. It landed in Kent in 597, and soon converted King <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht_of_Kent" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht of Kent</a>, who gave Augustine the land on which he founded the abbey that later became St Augustine's, Canterbury.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The medieval chronicler <a href="Bede" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bede</a> records that sometime after the mission's arrival in England,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> probably in late 600,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Peter, along with fellow-missionary <a href="Laurence_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Laurence</a>, was sent back to Pope Gregory. This deputation was to relay the news of Augustine's successes in Kent, and to request more missionaries.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> They also conveyed to the pope a number of inquiries from Augustine about how to proceed with the mission, and when they returned in 601, they brought back Gregory's replies to Augustine.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Peter became the abbot of the monastery that &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht founded in Canterbury, originally dedicated to the saints <a href="Saint_Peter" title="wikilink">Peter</a> and <a href="Saint_Paul" title="wikilink">Paul</a>, but later rededicated as St Augustine's, after the leader of the mission.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Bede describes Peter as both abbot and <em><a href="presbyter" class="uri" title="wikilink">presbyter</a></em>, a word usually translated as priest.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="death-and-veneration">Death and veneration</h2>
<p>Peter drowned while crossing the <a href="English_Channel" title="wikilink">English Channel</a> on the way to Gaul,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> at a place called Ambleteuse, near Boulogne.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> At first he was buried hastily nearby, but Bede reports that after a light illuminated the grave every night, the locals realised Peter was a saint and exhumed him and re-interred him in Boulogne. The actual date of death is unknown, and since his feast day was celebrated on two different days, 30 December or 6 January, that information does not clear up the mystery. The date of his death is reported to have been 1 year, 7 months and 3 weeks after Augustine's, by <a href="Thomas_of_Elmham" title="wikilink">Thomas of Elmham</a>, a 15th century chronicler. If this is true, this would give a year of death between 605 and 611.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> This information, however, is contradicted by the fact that Peter was present at the Council of Paris in 614, convened by <a href="Chlothar_II" title="wikilink">Chlothar II</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> It is possible that he died during his return from the Council of Paris.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>He is a considered a saint, with a feast day on 6 January. His cult was <a href="Canonization#Roman_Catholic_procedure_since_1983" title="wikilink">confirmed</a> in 1915.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> A <em>Vita Petri</em>, or <em>Life of Peter</em>, written by <a href="Eadmer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eadmer</a> in the 12th century, exists in manuscript form, but it is unreliable.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> There is evidence that Peter was the object of veneration in Boulogne in the 15th century, and a church in that town was associated with Peter, although probably not from the start of his cult.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
