If they give in to weakness, following the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), in the depths of their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love.

<p>Church teaching on the sixth commandment includes a discussion on <a href="chastity" class="uri" title="wikilink">chastity</a>.

<h4 id="offenses-against-chastity">Offenses against chastity</h4>
<p>The <em>Catechism</em> lists the following &quot;offenses against chastity&quot;<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> in increasing order of gravity:<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li>Lust: the Church teaches that sexual pleasure is good and created by God, who meant for spouses to &quot;experience pleasure and enjoyment of body and spirit&quot;. Kreeft says, &quot;Lust does not mean sexual pleasure as such, nor the delight in it, nor the desire for it in its right context.&quot;<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> Lust is the desire for sexual pleasure alone, outside its intended purpose of procreation and the uniting of man and woman, body and soul, in mutual self-donation.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a></li>
<li>Masturbation is considered sinful for the same reasons as lust, but is a step above lust in that it involves a physical act instead of a mental one.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a></li>
<li>Fornication is the sexual union of an unmarried man and an unmarried woman. This is considered contrary to &quot;the dignity of persons and of human sexuality&quot; because it is not ordered to the &quot;good of spouses&quot; or the &quot;generation and education of children.&quot;<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></li>
<li>Pornography ranks higher because it is considered a perversion of the sexual act that is intended for distribution to third parties for viewing.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a></li>
<li>Prostitution is considered sinful for both the prostitute and the customer; it reduces a person to an instrument of sexual pleasure, violating human dignity and harming society. The gravity of the sinfulness is less for prostitutes&lt;U+2014&gt;who are forced into the act by destitution, blackmail or social pressure&lt;U+2014&gt;than it is for the customer.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a></li>
<li>Rape is an intrinsically evil act that can cause grave damage to the victim for life.</li>
<li>Incest, or &quot;rape of children by parents or other adult relatives&quot; or &quot;those responsible for the education of the children entrusted to them&quot; is considered the most heinous of sexual sins.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a><a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a></li>

<h4 id="homosexuality">Homosexuality</h4>
<p>The <em>Catechism</em> devotes a separate section to homosexuality within its explanation of the sixth commandment. Like heterosexual acts outside of marriage, <a href="Homosexuality_and_Roman_Catholicism" title="wikilink">homosexual acts are considered sins</a>. The Church distinguishes between homosexual attractions, which are not considered sinful, and homosexual acts, which are. The <em>Catechism</em> states that they &quot;violate natural law, cannot bring forth life, and do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved.&quot;<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a><a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> The Church teaches that a homosexual inclination is &quot;objectively disordered&quot; and can be a great trial for the person, who the Church teaches must be &quot;accepted with respect, compassion and sensitivity ... unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided.&quot;<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a><a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>
<p>Homosexuals are, according to the Church, &quot;called to chastity&quot;. They are instructed to practice the virtues of &quot;self-mastery&quot; that teaches &quot;inner freedom&quot; using the support of friends, prayer and grace found in the sacraments of the Church.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> These tools are meant to help homosexuals &quot;gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection&quot;, which is a state to which all Christians are called.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a></p>
<p>Within the Church, two lay movements exist that represent opposing philosophies: <a href="DignityUSA" class="uri" title="wikilink">DignityUSA</a> seeks to change the Church's teachings to justify homosexual acts; <a href="Courage_International" title="wikilink">Courage International</a> is an organization of homosexuals who &quot;support each other in the sincere effort to live in chastity and in fidelity to Christ and his Church&quot;.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a></p>

<p>According to Church teaching, spousal love is intended to form an unbroken, two-fold end: the union of husband and wife and the transmission of life.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> The unitive aspect includes the transference of each partner's being &quot;so that they are no longer two but one flesh.&quot;<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> The <a href="Catholic_marriage" title="wikilink">sacrament of matrimony</a> is viewed as God's sealing the consent which binds the partners together. Church teaching on the marital state requires spousal acceptance of each other's failures and faults, and the recognition that the &quot;call to holiness in marriage&quot; is one that requires a process of spiritual growth and conversion that can last throughout life.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="fecundity-of-marriage-sexual-pleasure-birth-control">Fecundity of marriage, sexual pleasure, birth control</h4>
<p>Throughout Church history, Catholic thinkers offered differing opinions on sexual pleasure. Some saw it as sinful, while others disagreed.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> The Church did not have a formal position until the 1546 Council of Trent decided that &quot;concupiscence&quot; invited sin but was &quot;not formally sinful in itself.&quot;<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> In 1679, Pope Innocent XI condemned &quot;marital sex exercised for pleasure alone&quot;.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a> The Church position on sexual activity can be summarized as: &quot;sexual activity belongs only in marriage as an expression of total self-giving and union, and always open to the possibility of new life.&quot; Sexual acts in marriage are considered &quot;noble and honorable&quot; and are meant to be enjoyed with &quot;joy and gratitude.&quot;<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a></p>
<p>Artificial <a href="contraception" title="wikilink">birth control</a> predates Christianity; all Christian denominations have condemned these methods throughout their histories. This attitude began to change when the <a href="Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Church of England</a> became the first to accept the practice in 1930.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> The Catholic Church responded to this new development by issuing the papal encyclical <em><a href="Casti_Connubii" title="wikilink">Casti Connubii</a></em> on 31 December 1930. The 1968 papal encyclical <em><a href="Humanae_Vitae" title="wikilink">Humanae Vitae</a></em> is a reaffirmation of the Catholic Church's traditional view of marriage and marital relations, and a continued condemnation of artificial birth control.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a></p>
<p>The Church encourages large families, seeing them as a blessing. It recognizes that responsible parenthood sometimes calls for reasonable spacing or limiting of births and considers <a href="natural_family_planning" title="wikilink">natural family planning</a> as morally acceptable, but rejects all methods of artificial contraception.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a> The Church rejects all forms of <a href="Reproductive_technology" title="wikilink">artificial insemination and fertilization</a> because the techniques divorce the sexual act from the creation of a child. The <em>Catechism</em> states, &quot;A child is not something <em>owed</em> to one, but is a <em>gift</em> ... 'the supreme gift of marriage.{{'&quot;}}<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a></p>
<p>Many Church members and non-members have criticized Church support for natural family planning, and contend it contributes to overpopulation and poverty.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> The Church's rejection of <a href="condom" class="uri" title="wikilink">condom</a> use is widespreadly criticized, in particular with regard to countries where the incidence of <a href="AIDS" class="uri" title="wikilink">AIDS</a> and <a href="HIV" class="uri" title="wikilink">HIV</a> has reached epidemic proportions. In its defense, the Church cites countries such as Kenya and Uganda, where behavioral changes are encouraged alongside condom use, and where greater progress in controlling the disease has been made than in countries that promote condom use alone.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a><a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="offenses-against-the-dignity-of-marriage">Offenses against the dignity of marriage</h4>
<p>According to the Church, adultery and divorce are considered offenses against the dignity of marriage and are defined as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adultery is the sexual union of a man and woman where at least one is married to someone else. It is for this reason that the Church considers it a greater sin than fornication.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> Kreeft states, &quot;The adulterer sins against his spouse, his society, and his children as well as his own body and soul.&quot;<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a></li>
<li>Divorce: According to the Catholic <em><a href="New_American_Bible" title="wikilink">New American Bible</a></em> translation, Jesus taught, &quot;whoever divorces his wife (unless the marriage is unlawful) causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.&quot;<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> Explaining Church interpretation of this teaching, Kreeft says Jesus considered divorce to be an accommodation that had slipped into Jewish law.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> The Church teaches that marriage was created by God and was meant to be indissoluble: like the creation of a child that cannot be &quot;un-created&quot;, neither can the &quot;one flesh&quot; of the marriage bond.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a> The <em>Catechism</em> states, &quot;Divorce is a grave offense against the natural law. It claims to break the contract, to which the spouses freely consented, to live with each other till death.&quot;<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> By marrying another, the divorced person adds to the gravity of the offense as the remarried spouse is considered to be in a state of &quot;public and permanent adultery&quot;.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="separation-civil-divorce-annulments">Separation, civil divorce, annulments</h4>
<p>According to the Church, there are situations that do not equate to divorce:</p>
<ol>
<li>In extreme situations, such as domestic violence, separation is allowed. This is not considered a divorce and may be justified.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a></li>
<li>Civil divorce is not a divorce according to the Church. If it is deemed to be the only way of ensuring legal rights, care of children, or protection of inheritance, the Church considers it morally acceptable.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a><a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a></li>
<li><a href="Annulment_(Catholic_Church)" title="wikilink">Annulment</a> is not a divorce; it is a ruling by the Church that the marriage was never valid. The marriage is deemed invalid if it lacks one of five integral elements: it should be &quot;complete&quot;, &quot;lifelong&quot;, &quot;mutual&quot;, a &quot;free gift&quot; and of &quot;man and woman&quot;.<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a> According to Pope John Paul II's <em>Address to the Roman Rota</em> on 22 January 1996, couples do not have a right to an annulment, but do have a right to make their case for nullity or validity before &quot;the competent Church authority and to request a decision in the matter.&quot;<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a> According to the Catholic Diocese of Arlington:
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;... signs that might indicate reasons to investigate for an annulment are: marriage that excluded at the time of the wedding the right to children, or to a permanent marriage, or to an exclusive commitment. In addition, there are youthful marriages; marriages of very short duration; marriages marked by serious emotional, physical, or substance abuse; deviant sexual practices; profound and consistent irresponsibility and lack of commitment; conditional consent to a marriage; fraud or deceit to elicit spousal consent; serious mental illness; or a previous bond of marriage.
