It runs from <a href="U.S._Route_1/9" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 1/9</a> in <a href="Ridgefield,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Ridgefield</a> east down the <a href="New_Jersey_Palisades" title="wikilink">New Jersey Palisades</a> to end at River Road (<a href="County_Route_505_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">County Route 505</a>) at the <a href="Hudson_River" title="wikilink">Hudson River</a> in <a href="Edgewater,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Edgewater</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><strong>Route 10</strong> was legislated in 1916 to run from <a href="Paterson,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Paterson</a> east via <a href="Hackensack,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Hackensack</a> and Ridgefield to the <a href="Public_Service_Railway" title="wikilink">Public Service Railway</a>'s <a href="Fort_Lee_Ferry" title="wikilink">Fort Lee Ferry</a> at Edgewater. From Paterson it used the existing <a href="Paterson_and_Hackensack_Turnpike" title="wikilink">Paterson and Hackensack Turnpike</a> (Market Street and Essex Street) to Hackensack and the <a href="Bergen_Turnpike" title="wikilink">Bergen Turnpike</a> (Hudson Street) to Ridgefield. Rather than use existing roads from Ridgefield down the Palisades to Edgewater, a whole new route was surveyed with better <a href="Grade_(slope)" title="wikilink">grades</a>. The road was taken over east of Central Avenue on <a href="July_11" title="wikilink">July 11</a>, <a href="1918" class="uri" title="wikilink">1918</a>, and west on <a href="March_9" title="wikilink">March 9</a>, <a href="1920" class="uri" title="wikilink">1920</a>. At its east end, Route 10 ran south several blocks on River Road to the ferry, just south of Dempsey Avenue. In Ridgefield, Broad Avenue was used to get between the new alignment and Bergen Turnpike.</p>
<p>In the <a href="1927_renumbering" title="wikilink">1927 renumbering</a>, 10 was renumbered to <strong>Route 5</strong>. Plans at the time were to built a new alignment from east of Ridgefield to <a href="Little_Ferry,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Little Ferry</a> (southeast of Hackensack), and form <a href="Route_S5_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Route S5</a> along the old road from Little Ferry to Ridgefield. The new <a href="Route_6_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Route 6</a> would share the alignment of 5 from Paterson to west of Hackensack, where it would turn southeast onto a new alignment to Little Ferry, then run with 5 again to east of Ridgefield, and split onto its own alignment to the <a href="George_Washington_Bridge" title="wikilink">George Washington Bridge</a>.</p>
<p>In 1929, the routes were redefined. Route 6 would be a completely new alignment from Paterson to the George Washington Bridge, and 5 would only run east from Ridgefield (ending at Broad Avenue, <a href="Route_1_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Route 1</a>, in Ridgefield). This removed old Route 10 west of Ridgefield from the state system (it was <strong>Route 10N</strong> until it was turned over to the county), and Route 5 now only ran along the newly-built section of 10. When the state took over <a href="Route_S5_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Route S5</a> in 1931, instead of running from Ridgefield to Little Ferry on the former Route 10, it ran north on Grand Avenue from <a href="Route_1_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Route 1</a> to <a href="Route_6_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Route 6</a> in Ridgefield.</p>
<p>Route 5 may have continued to be marked west to Paterson until <a href="Route_6_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Route 6</a> was completed in 1937. Since then, the only change was in 2000 or 2001, when the section along River Road to the former ferry was removed.</p>
