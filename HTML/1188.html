<p>In England the <a href="House_of_Normandy" title="wikilink">Norman kings</a> after the <a href="Norman_conquest_of_England" title="wikilink">Conquest of England</a> conducted much of the business of state utilizing a council called the <em>curia regis</em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It was similar to, but not the same as the <a href="Witenagemot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Witenagemot</a> (or Witan) which advised the <a href="List_of_Anglo-Saxon_monarchs_and_kingdoms" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon kings of England</a>, and the <em><a href="Curia_Ducis" title="wikilink">Curia Ducis</a></em> which served the <a href="Dukes_of_Normandy" title="wikilink">Dukes of Normandy</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> This council existed in two forms, the great <em>curia regis</em> or <em><a href="Magnum_Concilium" title="wikilink">Magnum Concilium</a></em>, composed of the <a href="tenants-in-chief" class="uri" title="wikilink">tenants-in-chief</a>, the great officers of the king's court, and those <a href=":wikt:ecclesiastics" title="wikilink">ecclesiastics</a> who held lands of the king.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> This council met on special occasions and were summoned by the king. When not in session it was replaced by a smaller council which itself was in continuous session called the lesser or small <em>curia regis</em> made up of the king's officers of state and those <a href="magnates" class="uri" title="wikilink">magnates</a> who were at court.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The lesser <em>curia regis</em> was in essence the king's royal court and as such was an <a href=":wikt:itinerant" title="wikilink">itinerant</a> court that followed the king in all his travels.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The king, when traveling throughout his realm and as an integral part of the court, often heard suitors in person.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>curia regis</em> in either of its two forms did the business of state whether legislative, judicial, or diplomatic. These functions were executed seamlessly with no regard to specialized functions.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Neither the greater or lesser <em>curia regis</em> was subservient to the other it was the same entity.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Under the Norman kings the business of government was handled the same regardless of which curia was meeting at the time.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In judicial matters, the basis for the law remained the Anglo-Saxon Laws of <a href="Edward_the_Confessor" title="wikilink">Edward the Confessor</a> which both <a href="William_the_Conqueror" title="wikilink">William the Conqueror</a> and <a href="Henry_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry I</a> promised to uphold.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The powers of the sheriffs were retained as well as those of the communal courts (<a href="Hundred_(county_subdivision)#Hundred_courts" title="wikilink">Hundred Courts</a> and <a href="Shire_Court" title="wikilink">Shire Courts</a>).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The <em>curia regis</em> attempted to maintain continuity with its predecessor as the Norman kings wanted to be seen as the lawful successors of <a href="Edward_the_Confessor" title="wikilink">Edward the Confessor</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Gradually the <em>curia regis</em> began to branch off into entities which formed into other institutions,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> one of the first being the <a href="exchequer" class="uri" title="wikilink">exchequer</a> which specialized in the financial matters of government.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> During the thirteenth century the two forms of the <em>curia</em> themselves began to separate.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Even after a split between the two parts both continued to involve themselves in all three functions of the original <em>curia</em> and only slowly began to specialize in one function over the others.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The great <em>curia regis</em> after taking on representative elements formed into <a href="Parliament_of_England" title="wikilink">Parliament</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The first mention of a court of the king's bench (<em>curia regis</em>) being termed &quot;Parliament&quot; was in 1236 during the <a href="Michaelmas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Michaelmas</a> term (of the great <em>curia regis</em>).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>In France <a href="Maison_du_Roi" title="wikilink">the King's Court</a>, called the <em>Curia Regis</em> in Latin, and functioned as an advisory body under the early <a href="House_of_Capet" title="wikilink">Capetian kings</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> It was composed of a number of the king's trusted advisers but only a few traveled with the king at any time.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> By the later twelfth century it had become a judicial body with a few branching off to remain the king's council.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> By the fourteenth century the term <em>curia regis</em> was no longer used.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> However, it had served as a predecessor to later sovereign assemblies; the <a href="Parlement" class="uri" title="wikilink">Parlement</a> which was a judiciary body, the Chamber of Accounts which was a financial body and <a href="Council_of_State_(France)" title="wikilink">King's Council</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
