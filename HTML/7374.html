The claims of invasion of privacy and defamation arising from comments posted about Snyder on the Westboro website were dismissed on <a href="First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">First Amendment</a> grounds, but the case proceeded to trial on the remaining three counts.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> At the trial, Albert Snyder testified: </p>

<p>In 1999, <a href="Michael_Moore" title="wikilink">Michael Moore</a> organized a humorous counter protest against the church for his television show <em><a href="The_Awful_Truth_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">The Awful Truth</a></em>. He followed Phelps around the country in the &quot;Sodomobile&quot;, a pink bus filled with gay men and women.

<p>Two days after the September 11 attacks, a 19-year old man named Jared Dailey stood on the street corner facing the church holding up a plywood sign that said &quot;Not today, Fred&quot;. Within two days, 86 people joined him, waving American flags and anti-hate signs.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> Since then, &quot;Not today, Fred&quot; has become a commonly used motto for counter protests against Phelps.</p>
<p>On December 12, 2008, the group picketed a production of <em>The Laramie Project</em> at the Boston Center for the Arts. Local activists held a <a href="Phelps-A-Thon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phelps-A-Thon</a> in response. Supporters pledged online to donate for every minute WBC protested. The event raised over $4,600 dollars for an LGBT-rights project, Driving Equality.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
<p>In March 2010, a Richmond Virginia ad-hoc group formed to create a counter protest to an upcoming Westboro Baptist Church visit protesting against Jewish and LGBT organizations. Pennies In Protest took pledges for each minute of the WBC protest. The funds (approx. $14,000) were then donated to those same Jewish and LGBT organizations that WBC was protesting.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a><a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>
<p>On December 11, 2010, the day of the funeral of <a href="Elizabeth_Edwards" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Edwards</a>, a group called &quot;Line of Love&quot; planned to have about 200 protesters on the north side of West Edenton Street in <a href="Raleigh,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Raleigh, North Carolina</a> while 10 Westboro members picketed on the south side of the street, two blocks away from the funeral. While Westboro members who disagreed with Edwards' tolerance for gays were &quot;promoting awareness of the dangers of homosexuality&quot;, Line of Love had the goal of &quot;promoting proper respect for funerals&quot;.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
<p>On February 24, 2011, <a href="hacktivism" title="wikilink">hacktivists</a> successfully took Westboro Baptist Church's websites down.

<p>During a picket in <a href="Seaford,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Seaford, Delaware</a> on May 21, 2006, a mob broke through police lines and tried to assault WBC members who fled into a police van. Some of the mob then began banging on the van attempting to get inside. Two windows of the van were shattered before the van could get away.

<p>On November 30, 2010, disabled Army veteran Ryan Newell was arrested in his parked SUV outside the <a href="Wichita,_Kansas" title="wikilink">Wichita, Kansas</a>, city hall while members of WBC were in a meeting inside. Guns and ammunition were found in the back of the SUV, and Newell was charged with weapons violations and felony conspiracy to commit aggravated battery. On June 23, 2011, Newell pled guilty to impersonating a law enforcement officer and was sentenced to two years of probation. Newell received public support for his actions, and fundraisers and websites were created by the public to help in his defense.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a><a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="Patriot_Guard_Riders" title="wikilink">Patriot Guard Riders</a> is a motorcyclist group composed mostly of veterans who attend the funerals of members of the U.S. Armed Forces at the invitation of the deceased's family.

<h3 id="parodies">Parodies</h3>

<p>A slogan commonly invoked at the counter protests is &quot;God hates figs&quot;. Parodying the WBC all-capitals &quot;God hates fags&quot; signs, the counter-protest signs often invoke a passage in the <a href="Bible" title="wikilink">Biblical</a> book of <a href="Gospel_of_Matthew" title="wikilink">Matthew</a> to justify the claim about God and his feelings about <a href="Common_fig" title="wikilink">figs</a>. The signs have been noted at counter-protests at the University of Chicago;<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> in Spartanburg, South Carolina;<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> and in Portsmouth, New Hampshire,<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> as well as at the non-WBC-themed <a href="Rally_to_Restore_Sanity" title="wikilink">Rally to Restore Sanity</a>.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> The use of the signs has been invoked as a sign of sanity by the ACLU<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> and others.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>
<p>Documentation given out at various counter-protests cite biblical verses<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> in which <a href="Jesus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jesus</a> says that none should eat the fruit of a fig tree (), in which <a href="Cursing_the_fig_tree" title="wikilink">Jesus causes a fig tree to wither</a> (), and in which God promises, as a punishment, to make someone like bad figs ().

<h3 id="criticism">Criticism</h3>
<p>A number of Phelps' critics have suggested that the actions of the Westboro Baptist Church are a ploy to receive attention above all else. Counter-protesting against the group, they suggest, gives them attention and incentive that they do not deserve; and a more effective response against Phelps would be to ignore his congregation completely.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a><a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a><a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> WBC, through the closely related Phelps Chartered law firm, has collected fees under the <a href="Civil_Rights_Attorney&#39;s_Fees_Award_Act_of_1976" title="wikilink">Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976</a> when their protests have been unlawfully disrupted.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
