It is sometimes referred to as simply <strong>Washington Square</strong>. It was located across Walton Street from <a href="Newberry_Library" title="wikilink">Newberry Library</a> at 901 N. Clark St. in the <a href="Near_North_Side,_Chicago" title="wikilink">Near North Side</a> <a href="Community_areas_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">community area</a> of <a href="Chicago,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Chicago</a>, <a href="Illinois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Illinois</a>, <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">USA</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It is <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a>'s oldest existing small park.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is one of 4 <a href="Chicago_Park_District" title="wikilink">Chicago Park District</a> parks named after persons surnamed <a href="Washington_(disambiguation)" title="wikilink">Washington</a> (<a href="Washington_Park,_Chicago_(park)" title="wikilink">Washington Park</a>, <a href="Harold_Washington_Park" title="wikilink">Harold Washington Park</a>, <a href="Dinah_Washington_Park" title="wikilink">Dinah Washington Park</a>).

<h2 id="origin">Origin</h2>
<p>On <a href="September_4" title="wikilink">September 4</a>, <a href="1842" class="uri" title="wikilink">1842</a>,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> the city received a three-acre parcel that was donated by the members of the American Land Company for use as a public park. The property had once been a cow path with a well for farmers to water their cattle.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The donors named contributed the name Washington Square. Between 1869 and the 1890s, the city improved Washington Square with lawn, trees, bisecting diagonal walks, limestone coping, picket fencing and an attractive Victorian fountain. By the time <a href="Chicago_City_Council" title="wikilink">Alderman</a> McCormick became President of Drainage Board in 1906, the fountain had been razed and the park had deteriorated. Alderman McCormick devoted his aldermanic salary to improving the park. He donated a $600 fountain, and the city allocated an additional $10,000 to rehabilitate the park. By the 1910s, the neighborhood surrounding Washington Square had become more diverse.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The original purpose of the neighborhood park was as a place of assembly to discuss community issues.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Chicago has a long storied history of public speeches both for entertainment and educational purposes. The <a href="Haymarket_Riot" title="wikilink">Haymarket Riot</a> first started as an anarchist workers rally. <a href="Daniel_Burnham" title="wikilink">Daniel Burnham</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s March 27, 1897 lecture for the <a href="Commercial_Club_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">Commercial Club of Chicago</a> inspired the club to provide $80,000 to publish the <a href="Burnham_Plan" title="wikilink">Burnham Plan</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Washington Square Park has been the geographic center of Chicago public speeches. By the 1890s the park acquired its Bughouse Square moniker. Soapbox orators waxed on topics ranging from gender relations to Communism<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> It served as a home for soapbox orators on warm-weather evenings from the 1910s to the mid-1960s. Like <a href="Speakers&#39;_Corner" title="wikilink">Speakers' Corner</a> in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>'s <a href="Hyde_Park,_London" title="wikilink">Hyde Park</a>, Washington Square became a popular spot for soap box orators. Artists, writers, political radicals, and hobos pontificated, lectured, recited poetry, ranted and raved. A group of regulars formed &quot;The Dill Pickle Club,&quot; devoted to free expression. For years Washington Square orators appointed their own honorary &quot;king.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In its heydays in the 1920s and 1930s, revolutionary left soapboxers were occasionally joined by poets, religionists and cranks.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In 1959, the city transferred Washington Square to the Chicago Park District.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="today">Today</h2>
<p>Every July, the Bughouse Square Committee continues to oversee the annual <a href="Bughouse_Square_Debates" title="wikilink">Bughouse Square Debates</a> free speech gathering in conjunction with the Newberry Library&lt;U+2019&gt;s annual book sale.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The debates are part of an annual festival to recreate the atmosphere of speeches and debates by soap box orators that once flourished in the park.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Although Alderman McCormick's fountain was removed in the 1970s, in the late 1990s, the park district, the city, and neighborhood organizations agreed on a restoration plan for Washington Square. Improvements include a reconstructed historic fountain, period lighting, fencing, and new plantings.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In the west part of the park, there is a memorial tablet designating the park as &quot;Chicago's Premier Free Speech Forum.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
