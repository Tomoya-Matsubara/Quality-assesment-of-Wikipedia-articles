<p>Born <strong>Gary Lachlan Mack</strong> in <a href="Calgary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calgary</a>, <a href="Alberta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alberta</a>, by the age of nineteen he became the youngest news director at the <a href="AM_radio" title="wikilink">AM radio</a> <a href="radio_station" title="wikilink">station</a>, <a href="CKLW" class="uri" title="wikilink">CKLW</a> in <a href="Windsor,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Windsor</a>, <a href="Ontario" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ontario</a>, which also served <a href="Detroit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Detroit</a>, <a href="Michigan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Michigan</a> as well as <a href="Toledo,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Toledo</a> and <a href="Cleveland,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Cleveland</a> in <a href="Ohio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ohio</a> and covered twenty eight states and six provinces. This was during its &quot;Big 8/20&lt;U+00B7&gt;20 News&quot; period, and also around the time <a href="RKO_General" title="wikilink">RKO General</a> was forced to sell the station, due to a change in Canadian ownership rules that prohibited foreign firms from controlling Canadian licensed stations.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1973, he read a Toronto newspaper editorial written by <a href="Gordon_Sinclair" title="wikilink">Gordon Sinclair</a> of <a href="CFRB" class="uri" title="wikilink">CFRB</a> in <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a>, a <a href="The_Americans_(commentary)" title="wikilink">commentary about America</a>. MacGregor then read the patriotic commentary on CKLW Radio as part of a public affairs program; and, due to the huge response he was asked to record &quot;The Americans&quot; with &quot;<a href="America_the_Beautiful" title="wikilink">America the Beautiful</a>&quot; performed by The <a href="Detroit_Symphony_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Detroit Symphony Orchestra</a> as the background music. Both MacGregor and Sinclair released recorded versions of the commentary. MacGregor's version of the record (released on <a href="Westbound_Records" title="wikilink">Westbound Records</a>) became a bigger hit than Sinclair's in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, reaching #4 on the <em><a href="Billboard_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Billboard</a></em> <a href="Billboard_Hot_100" title="wikilink">Hot 100</a> <a href="record_chart" title="wikilink">chart</a> the week of February 9, 1974.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In Canada, MacGregor's version hit #1, while Sinclair's hit #24. His recording has sold over three and a half million copies,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and all of his proceeds have been donated to the <a href="American_Red_Cross" title="wikilink">American Red Cross</a>. MacGregor was honored with the &quot;National Americanism Award&quot;.</p>
<p>MacGregor was known for his deep voice and high-energy announcing style at CKLW; and for writing copy in a manner that was compared to that of sensational tabloid newspapers. He later made the transition to a more traditional anchoring and interviewing style when he moved to WWJ Newsradio 950, the CBS Radio all-news station in Detroit, where he served as both morning and afternoon drive anchor during his thirteen-year occupancy. MacGregor also became the first newsman in Detroit to simultaneously anchor prime-time newscasts on both radio (WWJ) and television (WKBD-TV 50).</p>
<p>By the mid 1980s MacGregor held dual citizenships in Canada and the United States. He died on January 3, 1995.
