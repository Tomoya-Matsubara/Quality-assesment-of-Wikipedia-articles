<p>The <strong>moa</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> were eleven <a href="species" class="uri" title="wikilink">species</a> (in six genera)<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> of flightless <a href="bird" title="wikilink">birds</a> endemic to <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a>. The two largest species, <em>Dinornis robustus</em> and <em>Dinornis novaezelandiae</em>, reached about  in height with neck outstretched, and weighed about .<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Moa are members of the <a href="Order_(biology)" title="wikilink">order</a> <a href="Struthioniformes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Struthioniformes</a> (or <a href="ratite" title="wikilink">ratites</a>) although some sources also recognise these as the separate <a href="Order_(biology)" title="wikilink">order</a> Dinornithiformes.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The eleven<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> species of moa are the only wingless birds, lacking even the vestigial wings which all other <a href="ratite" title="wikilink">ratites</a> have. They were the dominant <a href="herbivore" title="wikilink">herbivores</a> in New Zealand forest, shrubland and subalpine <a href="ecosystems" class="uri" title="wikilink">ecosystems</a> for thousands of years, and until the arrival of the <a href="M&lt;U+0101&gt;ori" class="uri" title="wikilink">M&lt;U+0101&gt;ori</a> were hunted only by the <a href="Haast&#39;s_Eagle" title="wikilink">Haast's Eagle</a>. It is generally considered that most, if not all, species of Moa died out by Maori hunting and habitat decline before <a href="Age_of_Discovery" title="wikilink">European discovery</a> and settlement.</p>
<h2 id="taxonomy">Taxonomy</h2>
<p><img src="Kiwi,_ostrich,_Dinornis.jpg" title="fig:Comparison of a kiwi, ostrich, and Dinornis, each with its egg" alt="Comparison of a kiwi, ostrich, and Dinornis, each with its egg" /> The <a href="kiwi" class="uri" title="wikilink">kiwi</a> were formerly regarded as the closest relatives of the moa, but comparisons of their DNA in a paper published in 2005 suggested moa were more closely related to the Australian <a href="emu" class="uri" title="wikilink">emu</a> and <a href="cassowary" class="uri" title="wikilink">cassowary</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> However research published in 2010 found that the moa's closest cousins were not the emu and cassowary but smaller terrestrial South American birds called the <a href="tinamou" title="wikilink">tinamous</a> which are able to fly.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Although dozens of species were described in the late 19th century and early 20th century, many were based on partial skeletons and turned out to be <a href="Synonym_(zoology)" title="wikilink">synonyms</a>. Currently, eleven species are formally recognised, although recent studies using <a href="ancient_DNA" title="wikilink">ancient DNA</a> recovered from bones in museum collections suggest that distinct lineages exist within some of these. One factor that has caused much confusion in moa taxonomy is the intraspecific variation of bone sizes, between glacial and inter-glacial periods (see <a href="Bergmann&lt;U+2019&gt;s_rule" title="wikilink">Bergmann&lt;U+2019&gt;s rule</a> and <a href="Allen&lt;U+2019&gt;s_rule" title="wikilink">Allen&lt;U+2019&gt;s rule</a>) as well as <a href="sexual_dimorphism" title="wikilink">sexual dimorphism</a> being evident in several species. <em><a href="Dinornis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dinornis</a></em> seems to have had the most pronounced <a href="sexual_dimorphism" title="wikilink">sexual dimorphism</a>, with females being up to 150% as tall and 280% as heavy as males—so much bigger that they were formerly classified as separate species until 2003.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Although moa were traditionally reconstructed in an upright position to create impressive height, analysis of their vertebral articulation indicates that they probably carried their heads forward,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> in the manner of a kiwi. This would have allowed them to graze on low-level vegetation, while being able to lift their heads and browse trees when necessary.</p>
<p><a href="Ancient_DNA" title="wikilink">Ancient DNA</a> analyses have determined that there were a number of cryptic evolutionary lineages in several moa genera. These may eventually be classified as species or subspecies; <em>Megalapteryx benhami</em> (Archey) which is synonymised with <em>M. didinus</em> (Owen) because the bones of both share all essential characters. Size differences can be explained by a north-south <a href="cline" class="uri" title="wikilink">cline</a> combined with temporal variation such that specimens were larger during the Otiran glacial period (the last ice age in New Zealand). Similar temporal size variation is known for the North Island <em>Pachyornis mappini</em>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Some of the other 'Large' ranges in variation for moa species can probably be explained by similar geographic and temporal factors.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Sometimes, the Dinornithidae are considered to be a full <a href="order_(biology)" title="wikilink">order</a> (Dinornithiformes), in which case the <a href="subfamily" title="wikilink">subfamilies</a> listed below would be advanced to full <a href="family_(biology)" title="wikilink">family</a> status (replacing &quot;-inae&quot; with &quot;-idae&quot;). <img src="Little_Bush_Moa.jpg" title="fig:Anomalopteryx didiformus skeleton" alt="Anomalopteryx didiformus skeleton" /> <img src="Emeus_crassus.jpg" title="fig:Emeus crassus fossil, Zoologisk Museum, Copenhagen" alt="Emeus crassus fossil, Zoologisk Museum, Copenhagen" /> Thus, the currently recognised genera and species are:<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> </p>

<h3 id="south-island">South Island</h3>
<p><img src="Hunting_Moa_-_rotated.jpg" title="fig:Restoration of Dinornis giganteus and Pachyornis elephantopus, both from the South Island" alt="Restoration of Dinornis giganteus and Pachyornis elephantopus, both from the South Island" /> The two main faunas identified in the South Island include: 1. The fauna of the high rainfall west coast beech (<em><a href="Nothofagus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nothofagus</a></em>) forests that included <em>Anomalopteryx didiformis</em> and <em>Dinornis giganteus</em>; and 2. The fauna of the dry rainshadow forest and shrublands east of the <a href="Southern_Alps" title="wikilink">Southern Alps</a> that included <em>Pachyornis elephantopus</em>, <em>Euryapteryx gravis</em>, <em>Emeus crassus</em> and <em>Dinornis robustus</em>. The two other moa species that existed in the South Island; <em>Pachyornis australis</em> and <em>Megalapteryx didinus</em> might be included in a &lt;U+2018&gt;<a href="subalpine" class="uri" title="wikilink">subalpine</a> fauna&lt;U+2019&gt;, along with the widespread <em>Dinornis robustus</em>. <em>P. australis</em> is the rarest of the moa species, and the only one yet to have been found in Maori middens. Its bones have been found in caves in the northwest <a href="Nelson,_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">Nelson</a> and <a href="Karamea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Karamea</a> districts (such as <a href="Honeycomb_Hill_Cave" title="wikilink">Honeycomb Hill Cave</a>), and some sites around the <a href="Wanaka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wanaka</a> district. <em>M. didinus</em> is more widespread. Its name &lt;U+2018&gt;upland moa&lt;U+2019&gt; reflects the fact its bones are commonly found in the subalpine zone. However, it also occurred down to sea level where there was suitable steep and rocky terrain (such as <a href="Punakaiki" class="uri" title="wikilink">Punakaiki</a> on the west coast and <a href="Central_Otago" title="wikilink">Central Otago</a>).</p>
<h3 id="north-island">North Island</h3>
<p>Significantly less is known about North Island paleofaunas, due to a paucity of fossil sites compared to the South Island; however, the basic pattern of moa-habitat relationships were the same.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Although the South Island and the North Island shared some moa species (<em>Euryapteryx gravis</em>, <em>Anomalopteryx didiformis</em>), most were exclusive to one island, reflecting divergence over several thousand years since lower sea level had resulted in a land bridge across <a href="Cook_Strait" title="wikilink">Cook Strait</a>. In the North Island, <em>Dinornis novaezealandiae</em> and <em>Anomalopteryx didiformis</em> dominated in high rainfall forest habitat; a similar pattern to the South Island. The other moa species present in the North Island (<em>Euryapteryx gravis</em>, <em>E. curtus</em>, and <em>Pachyornis geranoides</em>) tended to inhabit drier forest and shrubland habitats. <em>P. geranoides</em> occurred throughout the North Island, while the distributions of <em>E. gravis</em> and <em>E. curtus</em> were almost mutually exclusive, the former having only been found in coastal sites around the southern half of the North Island.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="biology">Biology</h2>
<p><img src="Dinornithidae_SIZE_01.png" title="fig:Size comparison between 4 moa species and a human. 1. D. giganteus. 2. E.crassus. 3. A. didiformis 4. D. novaezelandiae" alt="Size comparison between 4 moa species and a human. 1. D. giganteus. 2. E.crassus. 3. A. didiformis 4. D. novaezelandiae" width="200" /> It has been long suspected that the pairs of species of moa described as <em>Euryapteryx curtus</em>/<em>E. exilis</em>, <em>Emeus huttonii</em>/<em>E. crassus</em>, and <em>Pachyornis septentrionalis</em>/<em>P. mappini</em> constituted males and females, respectively. This has been confirmed by analysis for sex-specific genetic markers of DNA extracted from bone material.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> For example, prior to 2003 there were three species of <em>Dinornis</em> recognised: South Island giant moa (<em>D. giganteus</em>), North Island giant moa (<em>D. novaezealandiae</em>) and slender moa (<em>D. struthioides</em>). However, DNA showed that all <em>D. struthioides</em> were in fact males, and all <em>D. giganteus</em> were females. Therefore the three species of <em>Dinornis</em> were reclassified as two species, one each formerly occurring on <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a>'s North Island (<em>D. novaezealandiae</em>) and South Island (<em>D. robustus</em>);<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> <em>robustus</em> however, comprises three distinct genetic lineages and may eventually be classified as many species as discussed above.</p>

The beak of <em><a href="Pachyornis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pachyornis</a></em> <em>elephantopus</em> was analogous to a pair of <a href="secateur" title="wikilink">secateurs</a>, and was able to clip the fibrous leaves of New Zealand flax (<em><a href="Phormium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phormium</a></em> <em>tenax</em>) and twigs up to at least 8mm in diameter.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Like many other birds, moa swallowed <em>gizzard stones</em> (<a href="gastrolith" title="wikilink">gastroliths</a>), which were retained in their muscular gizzards, providing a grinding action that allowed them to eat coarse plant material. These stones were commonly smooth, rounded quartz pebbles, but stones over  in length have been found amongst preserved moa gizzard contents.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <em>Dinornis</em> gizzards could often contain several kilograms of stones.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="locomotion">Locomotion</h3>
<p><img src="Moa_footprints.jpg" title="fig:Preserved footprints of a large moa found in 1911" alt="Preserved footprints of a large moa found in 1911" /> Approximately eight moa <a href="fossil_trackway" title="wikilink">trackways</a>, with fossilised moa footprint impressions in fluvial silts have been found throughout the North Island, including Waikanae Creek (1872), Napier (1887), Manawatu River (1895), Marton (1896), Palmerston North (1911) (see photograph to right), Ragitikei River (1939), and underwater in Lake Taupo (1973). Analysis of the spacing of these tracks indicate walking speeds of between 3 and 5 km/h (1.75&lt;U+2013&gt;3 mph).<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="breeding">Breeding</h3>
<p>Examination of growth rings present in moa cortical bone has revealed that these birds were <a href="k-selection" title="wikilink">K-strategists</a>, as are many other large endemic New Zealand birds.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> They are characterised by having low <a href="fecundity" class="uri" title="wikilink">fecundity</a> and a long <a href="maturation" class="uri" title="wikilink">maturation</a> period, taking approximately ten years to reach adult size. The large <em>Dinornis</em> species took the same length of time to reach adult size as small moa species, and as a result had accelerated rate of skeletal growth during their juvenile years.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="eggs">Eggs</h4>
<p>Fragments of moa eggshell are often encountered in <a href="archaeological" class="uri" title="wikilink">archaeological</a> sites and <a href="sand_dunes" title="wikilink">sand dunes</a> around the <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> coast. Thirty six whole moa eggs exist in museum collections and vary greatly in size (from  in length and  wide).<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The outer surface of moa eggshell is characterised by small slit-shaped pores. The eggs of most moa species were white, although those of the upland moa (<em>Megalapteryx didinus</em>) were blue-green. A 2010 study by Huynen et al. has found that the eggs of certain species were fragile, only around a millimeter in thickness: &quot;Unexpectedly, several thin-shelled eggs were also shown to belong to the heaviest moa of the genera <em>Dinornis</em>, <em>Euryapteryx</em> and <em>Emeus</em>, making these, to our knowledge, the most fragile of all avian eggs measured to date. Moreover, sex-specific DNA recovered from the outer surfaces of eggshells belonging to species of <em>Dinornis</em> and <em>Euryapteryx</em> suggest that these very thin eggs were likely to have been incubated by the lighter males. The thin nature of the eggshells of these larger species of moa, even if incubated by the male, suggests that egg breakage in these species would have been common if the typical contact method of avian egg incubation was used.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Despite the bird's extinction, the high yield of DNA available from recovered fossilized eggs has allowed the moa to have its genome sequenced.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="nests">Nests</h4>
<p>There is no evidence to suggest that moa were colonial nesters. While evidence of moa nesting is often inferred from accumulations of eggshell fragments found in <a href="caves" class="uri" title="wikilink">caves</a> and rock shelters, little evidence exists of the <a href="bird_nest" title="wikilink">nests</a> themselves. Excavations of rock shelters in the eastern North Island during the 1940s uncovered moa nests, which were described as &quot;<em>small depressions obviously scratched out in the soft dry <a href="pumice" class="uri" title="wikilink">pumice</a></em>&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Moa nesting material has also been recovered from rock shelters in the <a href="Central_Otago" title="wikilink">Central Otago</a> region of the South Island, where the dry climate has resulted in the preservation of plant material used to construct the nesting platform (including twigs that have been clipped by moa bills).<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> <a href="Seeds" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seeds</a> and <a href="pollen" class="uri" title="wikilink">pollen</a> within moa coprolites found amongst the nesting material provide evidence that the nesting season was late spring to summer.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="vocalisation">Vocalisation</h3>
<p>Although there is no surviving record of what sounds moa made, some idea of their calls can be gained from fossil evidence. The <a href="Vertebrate_trachea" title="wikilink">trachea</a> of moa were supported by many small rings of bone known as tracheal rings. Excavation of these rings from articulated skeletons has shown that at least two moa genera (<em>Euryapteryx</em> and <em>Emeus</em>) exhibited tracheal elongation, that is, their trachea were up to 1 metre (3 ft) long and formed a large loop within the body cavity.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> These are the only ratites known to exhibit this feature, which is also present in several other bird groups including <a href="swan" title="wikilink">swans</a>, <a href="Crane_(bird)" title="wikilink">cranes</a> and <a href="guinea_fowl" title="wikilink">guinea fowl</a>. The feature is associated with deep, resonant vocalisations that can travel long distances.</p>

<p><img src="Moa_foot.jpg" title="fig:Preserved Megalapteryx foot, Natural History Museum" alt="Preserved Megalapteryx foot, Natural History Museum" /> <img src="Moaupland.jpg" title="fig:Megalapteryx didinus head" alt="Megalapteryx didinus head" /> Several remarkable examples of moa remains have been found that exhibit soft tissues (<a href="muscle" class="uri" title="wikilink">muscle</a>, <a href="skin" class="uri" title="wikilink">skin</a>, <a href="feathers" class="uri" title="wikilink">feathers</a>), preserved through <a href="desiccation" class="uri" title="wikilink">desiccation</a> when the bird died in a naturally dry site (for example, a cave with a constant dry breeze blowing through it).

<p>In addition to these specimens, loose moa feathers have been collected from caves and rockshelters in the southern South Island, and so some idea of the moa plumage can be gained. The preserved leg of <em>Megalapteryx didinus</em> from the Old Man Range reveals that this species was feathered right down to the foot. This is likely to have been an adaptation to living in high altitude snowy environments, and is also seen in the <a href="Darwin&lt;U+2019&gt;s_Rhea" title="wikilink">Darwin&lt;U+2019&gt;s Rhea</a> which lives in a similar seasonally snowy habitat.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Moa feathers are up to  long and a range of colours have been reported, including reddish brown, white, yellowish and purplish.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Dark feathers with white or creamy tips have also been found, and indicate that some moa species may have had plumage with a speckled appearance.</p>
<h2 id="extinction">Extinction</h2>
<p><img src="Moa_mock_hunt.jpg" title="fig:Early 20th century reconstruction of a moa hunt" alt="Early 20th century reconstruction of a moa hunt" /> The moa's only predator was the massive <a href="Haast&#39;s_Eagle" title="wikilink">Haast's Eagle</a>—until the arrival of human settlers.</p>
<p>The <a href="M&lt;U+0101&gt;ori" class="uri" title="wikilink">M&lt;U+0101&gt;ori</a> arrived sometime before A.D. 1300, and all moa genera were soon driven to extinction by hunting and, to a lesser extent, forest clearance. By about A.D. 1400 almost all moa are generally thought to have become extinct, along with the <a href="Haast&#39;s_Eagle" title="wikilink">Haast's Eagle</a> which had relied on them for food. Recent research using <a href="carbon-14_dating" title="wikilink">carbon-14 dating</a> of <a href="midden" title="wikilink">middens</a> strongly suggests that this took less than a hundred years,<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> rather than the period of exploitation lasting several hundred years which had been earlier believed.</p>
<p>Some authors have speculated that a few <em>Megalapteryx didinus</em> may have persisted in remote corners of New Zealand until the 18th and even 19th centuries, but the view is not widely accepted.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Some M&lt;U+0101&gt;ori hunters claimed to be in pursuit of the moa as late as the 1770s. Whalers and sealers recalled seeing monstrous birds along the coast of the South Island, and in the 1820s a man named George Pauley made an unverified claim of seeing a moa in the <a href="Otago_Region" title="wikilink">Otago Region</a> of New Zealand.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> An expedition in the 1850s under Lieutenant A.

<h2 id="discovery-by-science">Discovery by science</h2>
<p><img src="Dinornis1387.jpg" title="fig:Sir Richard Owen with Dinornis robustus skeleton" alt="Sir Richard Owen with Dinornis robustus skeleton" /> <a href="Joel_Samuel_Polack" title="wikilink">Joel Polack</a>, a trader who lived on the East Coast of the North Island from 1834 to 1837, records in 1838 that he had been shown 'several large fossil ossifications' found near Mt Hikurangi. He was certain that these were the bones of a species of emu or ostrich, noting that 'the Natives add that in times long past they received the traditions that very large birds had existed, but the scarcity of animal food, as well as the easy method of entrapping them, has caused their extermination'. Polack further noted that he had received reports from M&lt;U+0101&gt;ori that a 'species of Struthio' still existed in remote parts of the South Island.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Dieffenbach<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> also refers to a fossil from the area near Mt Hikurangi, and surmises that it belongs to 'a bird, now extinct, called Moa (or Movie) by the natives'. In 1839, <a href="John_W._Harris" title="wikilink">John W. Harris</a>, a <a href="Poverty_Bay" title="wikilink">Poverty Bay</a> flax trader who was a natural history enthusiast, was given a piece of unusual bone by a M&lt;U+0101&gt;ori who had found it in a river bank. He showed the  fragment of bone to his uncle, John Rule, a Sydney surgeon, who sent it to <a href="Richard_Owen" title="wikilink">Richard Owen</a> who at that time was working at the Hunterian Museum at the <a href="Royal_College_of_Surgeons_of_England" title="wikilink">Royal College of Surgeons</a> in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Owen became a noted <a href="biologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">biologist</a>, <a href="anatomist" class="uri" title="wikilink">anatomist</a> and <a href="paleontologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">paleontologist</a> at the <a href="British_Museum" title="wikilink">British Museum</a>.</p>
<p>Owen puzzled over the fragment for almost four years. He established it was part of the <a href="femur" class="uri" title="wikilink">femur</a> of a big animal, but it was uncharacteristically light and honeycombed. Owen announced to a skeptical scientific community and the world that it was from a giant extinct bird like an <a href="ostrich" class="uri" title="wikilink">ostrich</a>, and named it <em>Dinornis</em>. His deduction was ridiculed in some quarters but was proved correct with the subsequent discoveries of considerable quantities of moa bones throughout the country, sufficient to reconstruct skeletons of the birds.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>In July 2004, the <a href="Natural_History_Museum" title="wikilink">Natural History Museum</a> in London placed on display the moa bone fragment Owen had first examined, to celebrate 200 years since his birth, and in memory of Owen as founder of the museum.</p>
<h3 id="moa-bone-deposits">Moa bone deposits</h3>
<p>Since the discovery of the first moa bones in the late 1830s, thousands more have been found. They occur in a range of late <a href="Quaternary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quaternary</a> and <a href="Holocene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Holocene</a> <a href="sedimentary" class="uri" title="wikilink">sedimentary</a> deposits, but are most common in three main types of site:</p>
<h4 id="caves">Caves</h4>
<p><img src="Moa_Cave.JPG" title="fig:Moa bones scattered across the floor of &#39;Moa Cave&#39;, Honeycomb Hill Cave System. This cave is a closed scientific reserve." alt="Moa bones scattered across the floor of &#39;Moa Cave&#39;, Honeycomb Hill Cave System. This cave is a closed scientific reserve." /> Bones are commonly found in <a href="Caves" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caves</a> or &lt;U+2018&gt;tomo&lt;U+2019&gt; (Maori word for doline or <a href="sinkhole" class="uri" title="wikilink">sinkhole</a>; often used to refer to pitfalls or vertical cave shafts). The two main ways that the moa bones were deposited in such sites were: 1. Birds that entered the cave to nest or escape bad weather, and subsequently died in the cave; and 2. Birds that fell into a vertical shaft and were unable to escape. Moa bones (and the bones of other extinct birds) have been found in caves throughout New Zealand, especially in the <a href="limestone" class="uri" title="wikilink">limestone</a>/<a href="marble" class="uri" title="wikilink">marble</a> areas of northwest Nelson, <a href="Karamea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Karamea</a>, <a href="Waitomo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Waitomo</a> and <a href="Te_Anau" title="wikilink">Te Anau</a>.</p>
<h4 id="dunes">Dunes</h4>
<p>Moa bones and eggshell fragments sometimes occur in active coastal sand dunes, where they may erode from <a href="paleosol" title="wikilink">paleosols</a> and concentrate in &lt;U+2018&gt;<a href="Blowout_(geology)" title="wikilink">blowouts</a>&lt;U+2019&gt; between dune ridges. Many such moa bones predate human settlement, although some can originate from Maori midden sites which frequently occur in dunes near harbours and river mouths (for example the large moa hunter sites at <a href="Shag_River" title="wikilink">Shag River</a>, <a href="Otago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Otago</a> and <a href="Wairau_Bar" title="wikilink">Wairau Bar</a>, <a href="Marlborough" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marlborough</a>).</p>
<h4 id="swampsmirings">Swamps/mirings</h4>
<p>Densely intermingled moa bones have been encountered in swamps throughout New Zealand. The most well-known example is at <a href="Pyramid_Valley" title="wikilink">Pyramid Valley</a> in north Canterbury,<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> where bones from at least 183 individual moa have been excavated. Many explanations were proposed to account for how these deposits had formed, ranging from poisonous spring waters to floods and wildfires. However the currently accepted explanation is that the bones accumulated at a slow rate over thousands of years, from birds that had entered the swamps to feed and became trapped in the soft sediment.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

Otago Museum holds the world&#39;s largest collection of moa remains." alt="Reconstruction of two moa species, Otago Museum, Dunedin.

<p>The rediscovery of the <a href="takah&lt;U+0113&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">takah&lt;U+0113&gt;</a> in 1948 after none had been seen since 1898 showed that rare birds may exist undiscovered for a long time. However, the takah&lt;U+0113&gt; is a much smaller bird than the moa, and was rediscovered after its tracks were identified—yet no reliable evidence of moa tracks has ever been found, and experts still contend that moa survival is extremely unlikely, since this would involve the ground-dwelling birds living unnoticed in a region visited often by <a href="hunter" title="wikilink">hunters</a> and <a href="hiker" title="wikilink">hikers</a>.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
