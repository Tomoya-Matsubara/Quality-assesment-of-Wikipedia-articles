<p>The <strong>Sognsvann Line</strong> () is a <a href="rapid_transit" title="wikilink">rapid transit</a> line on the <a href="Oslo_Metro" title="wikilink">Oslo Metro</a> of Norway. It branches from the <a href="Common_Tunnel" title="wikilink">Common Tunnel</a> at <a href="Majorstuen_(station)" title="wikilink">Majorstuen</a> and runs  to <a href="Sognsvann_(station)" title="wikilink">Sognsvann</a>. After <a href="Ullev&lt;U+00E5&gt;l_stadion_(station)" title="wikilink">Ullev&lt;U+00E5&gt;l stadion</a>, the <a href="Ring_Line_(Oslo)" title="wikilink">Ring Line</a> branches off. The Sognsvann Line serves the northwestern and northern neighborhoods of <a href="Oslo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oslo</a>, mostly within the borough of <a href="Nordre_Aker" title="wikilink">Nordre Aker</a>. The line is owned and maintained by <a href="Kollektivtransportproduksjon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kollektivtransportproduksjon</a> and has nine <a href="list_of_Oslo_Metro_stations" title="wikilink">stations</a>. Lines 3, 4, 5 and 6 serve the line, although the latter three branch off and continue along the Ring Line. This gives an average five-minute <a href="headway" class="uri" title="wikilink">headway</a> on the southern part and an average fifteen-minute headway on the northern part of the line.</p>
<p>The line opened on 10 October 1934 as a <a href="light_rail" title="wikilink">light rail</a>. In 1993, it was upgraded to metro standard as the first light rail west of Oslo, with two stations being closed. The Ring Line opened in 2003. <a href="Forskningsparken_(station)" title="wikilink">Forskningsparken</a> has transfer to the <a href="Oslo_Tramway" title="wikilink">Oslo Tramway</a> and serves <a href="Rikshospitalet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rikshospitalet</a>. Forskningsparken and <a href="Blindern_(station)" title="wikilink">Blindern</a> both serve the <a href="University_of_Oslo" title="wikilink">University of Oslo</a>, while Ullev&lt;U+00E5&gt;l stadion serves Norway's largest football venue. North of there the line mainly serves residential areas. Sognsvann serves the <a href="Norwegian_School_of_Sport_Sciences" title="wikilink">Norwegian School of Sport Sciences</a> and the recreational area <a href="Nordmarka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nordmarka</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The first plans for a light rail along the route of the Sognsvann Line was launched by <a href="Holmenkolbanen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Holmenkolbanen</a> in 1904. They called for a branch from <a href="Gaustad_(station)" title="wikilink">Gaustad Station</a> on the <a href="Holmenkoll_Line" title="wikilink">Holmenkoll Line</a> to Geitmyren and onwards to <a href="Sagene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sagene</a>. The next proposal for a line was launched in 1917, when <a href="Aker,_Norway" title="wikilink">Aker Municipality</a> established the company <a href="Akersbanerne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Akersbanerne</a>. It started work planning the <a href="&lt;U+00D8&gt;stensj&lt;U+00F8&gt;_Line" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00D8&gt;stensj&lt;U+00F8&gt; Line</a> as well as the Sognsvann Line. The neighborhoods of <a href="Sogn,_Oslo" title="wikilink">Sogn</a> and <a href="T&lt;U+00E5&gt;sen" class="uri" title="wikilink">T&lt;U+00E5&gt;sen</a> were being built, and the municipality wanted to establish a good transport system to make the areas more attractive. Holmenkolbanen stated that they should be prioritized to built the system, since they already had a line in the area, but the municipality wanted to have political control over the development of the area.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Ringlinje_1919.jpg" title="fig:Map of various proposals for lines in northern Oslo" alt="Map of various proposals for lines in northern Oslo" /> In 1920, Holmenkolbanen applied to build a branch from <a href="Fr&lt;U+00F8&gt;en_(station)" title="wikilink">Fr&lt;U+00F8&gt;en</a> via T&lt;U+00E5&gt;sen to <a href="Nydalen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nydalen</a> and <a href="Grefsen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grefsen</a>, along what is today the Ring Line. This proposal included a branch to Sognsvann. The <a href="Norwegian_Ministry_of_Labour_(1885&lt;U+2013&gt;1946)" title="wikilink">Ministry of Labour</a> granted the concession to Akersbanerne, who started construction in January 1922. However, due to a labor conflict, the work was put on hold in 1924.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1924, the <a href="R&lt;U+00F8&gt;a_Line" title="wikilink">R&lt;U+00F8&gt;a Line</a> (at the time called the Smestad Line) was taken over by Akersbanerne, but Holmenkolbanen retained the operation. After the first part of the Common Tunnel, from Majorstuen to Nationaltheatret, opened in 1928, Holmenkolbanen was in financial distress, and in 1932 Akersbanerne took over the majority of the shares of Holmenkolbanen. At the same time, the R&lt;U+00F8&gt;a and Sognsvann Lines were merged into Holmenkolbanen.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Work commenced again in 1933 and the line opened on 10 October 1934.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> At first the line was built with <a href="double_track" title="wikilink">double track</a> from Fr&lt;U+00F8&gt;en to <a href="&lt;U+00D8&gt;sthorn_(station)" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00D8&gt;sthorn</a> and <a href="single_track_(rail)" title="wikilink">single track</a> to Sognsvann. Between 1937 and 1939, the upper section was converted to double track. The construction spurred a massive residential construction along the line giving a good foundation for ridership.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>After the municipal merger between Oslo and Aker in 1948, Akersbanerne was merged into <a href="Oslo_Sporveier" title="wikilink">Oslo Sporveier</a>, although Holmenkolbanen remained a partially-owned subsidiary. In 1973, Oslo Sporveier bought the remaining shares, and two years later the operations were transferred to Oslo Sporveier, with Holmenkolbanen remaining a pure real estate company. The municipal take-over resulted in an upgrade to both the track and the rolling stock. New <a href="overhead_wire" title="wikilink">overhead wires</a> and new and heavier track were laid. From 1978, the <a href="OS_T1000" title="wikilink">T1300</a> trains were taken into use.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> With the take-over, the lines were numbered, and the Sognsvann Line designated 81, although this was quickly changed to 13.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Berg-T-bane-d8849.jpg" title="fig:Berg" alt="Berg" /> During the 1980s, the city decided to connect the four suburban lines west of the city center with the Oslo Metro. The Sognsvann Line was selected as the first line to be upgraded, so the two systems would become compatible. The line was upgraded to metro standard by replacing the overhead wire with a <a href="third-rail" class="uri" title="wikilink">third-rail</a> <a href="railway_electrification_system" title="wikilink">power supply</a> and installing <a href="automatic_train_protection" title="wikilink">automatic train protection</a>. All the stations were rebuilt, with platforms lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains, and the <a href="railway_platform_height" title="wikilink">platform height</a> increased. The third rail required all <a href="level_crossing" title="wikilink">level crossings</a> to be removed, resulting in the line being rebuilt several places to allow the road to underpass or overpass. The light rail permitted passengers to cross the lines at the stations, but this was made impossible with metro standard. Because of this, underpasses or overpasses were built at the stations.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Fr&lt;U+00F8&gt;en Station was rebuilt so only the trains on the Holmenkollen Line would stop there, while <a href="Holstein_(station)" title="wikilink">Holstein Station</a> was closed.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> All the stations, except Ullev&lt;U+00E5&gt;l stadion, were built in the same architectural style. They are constructed in concrete with steel columns and wooden sheds and fences. All platforms have a shed; Ullev&lt;U+00E5&gt;l stadion has a larger weather cover and has a design inspired by football.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The upgrade also included the installation of third-rail from Majorstuen to <a href="Stortinget_(station)" title="wikilink">Stortinget</a> in the Common Tunnel. From 10 January 1993, the Sognsvann Line re-open, and from 4 April, the line started operating through the Common Tunnel and connected to the <a href="Lambertseter_Line" title="wikilink">Lambertseter Line</a>. The new service became operated with <a href="OS_T1000" title="wikilink">T1000</a> rolling stock.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Oslo_tram_forskningenparken.JPG" title="fig:SL95 tram meets metro at Forskningsparken" alt="SL95 tram meets metro at Forskningsparken" /> Following the 1991 decision to build a new <a href="Rikshospitalet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rikshospitalet</a> at Gaustad, it was decided to extend the <a href="Ullev&lt;U+00E5&gt;l_Hageby_Line" title="wikilink">Ullev&lt;U+00E5&gt;l Hageby Line</a> of the tramway there, which would pass under the Sognsvann Line. Plans called for a transfer station at <a href="Blindern_(station)" title="wikilink">Blindern</a>, but this was later discarded in favor of a new station, <a href="Forskningsparken_(station)" title="wikilink">Forskningsparken</a>. It would replace <a href="Vestgrensa_(station)" title="wikilink">Vestgrensa</a>, which was considered too far away to be a suitable transfer point.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Forskningsparken would also serve the northern part of the Blindern campus.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> With the opening, Line 4 of the metro was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsarken, to Ullev&lt;U+00E5&gt;l stadion.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> There were complaints from local residents that the increased traffic on the line was causing too much noise, and neighbors demanded that noise shields be built.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1991, Oslo Sporveier presented plans to connect the Sognsvann Line to the <a href="Grorud_Line" title="wikilink">Grorud Line</a> with a new Ring Line.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The company also considered building the ring as part of the tramway, and have combined operation with both tram and metro on the Sognsvann Line. This was later discarded, despite the higher investment costs with a metro, since the tramway would give higher operating costs and longer travel time.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. It became clear that <a href="Berg_(station)" title="wikilink">Berg</a> would not be served by the Ring Line.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Many neighbors to the Sognsvann Line complained about the proposal, stating that they had hoped that the section from Majorstuen to Berg would have been rebuilt as a tunnel. They also argued that it was irrational that the line was running at-grade in densely populated areas, while it would run in a tunnel through the then mostly unpopulated Nydalen. To compensate, Oslo Sporveier stated that they would build noise screens along the line.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="service">Service</h2>
<p>The Sognsvann Line is served by lines 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Oslo Metro. Line 3 operates the full length of the Sognsvann Line, while lines 4, 5 and 6 branch off after Ullev&lt;U+00E5&gt;l stadion and serve the Ring Line. Lines 4 and 6 operate the full ring, but swap numbers between Nydalen and Storo. Because of this, Line 4 only operates from Majorstuen to the Ring, and Line 6 only operates the other direction. Line 5 operates in both directions and terminates at Storo. All four services operate with a fifteen-minute headway, except during late evenings and weekend mornings. This gives the stations Blindern, Forskningsparken and Ullev&lt;U+00E5&gt;l stadion an average five-minute headway to the city center and all stations in the Common Tunnel, and an average ten-minute headway to Nydalen and Storo. On the east side of the city, Line 3 connects with the <a href="&lt;U+00D8&gt;stensj&lt;U+00F8&gt;_Line" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00D8&gt;stensj&lt;U+00F8&gt; Line</a>, Line 4 with the <a href="Lambertseter_Line" title="wikilink">Lambertseter Line</a> and Line 5 with the Grorud Line. Travel time from Stortinget to Sognsvann is 18 minutes. The Oslo Metro is operated by <a href="Oslo_T-banedrift" title="wikilink">Oslo T-banedrift</a> on contract with <a href="Ruter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ruter</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
