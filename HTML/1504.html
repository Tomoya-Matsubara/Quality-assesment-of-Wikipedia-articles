<p><strong><em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em></strong> is an <a href="open_world" title="wikilink">open world</a> <a href="Action-adventure_game" title="wikilink">action-adventure</a> <a href="video_game" title="wikilink">video game</a> developed by <a href="Rockstar_North" title="wikilink">Rockstar North</a> and published by <a href="Rockstar_Games" title="wikilink">Rockstar Games</a>. It was released on 29 April 2008 for the <a href="PlayStation_3" title="wikilink">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="Xbox_360" title="wikilink">Xbox 360</a> consoles, and on 2 December 2008 on <a href="Microsoft_Windows" title="wikilink">Microsoft Windows</a>. It is the eleventh title in the <a href="Grand_Theft_Auto_(series)" title="wikilink"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em> series</a>, and the first main entry since 2004's <em><a href="Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas" title="wikilink">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></em>. Set within the fictional <a href="Liberty_City_(Grand_Theft_Auto)" title="wikilink">Liberty City</a> (based on <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>), the <a href="Single-player_video_game" title="wikilink">single-player</a> story follows a war veteran, <a href="Niko_Bellic" title="wikilink">Niko Bellic</a> and his attempts to escape his past while under pressure from loan sharks and mob bosses. The open world design lets players freely roam Liberty City, consisting of three main islands.</p>
<p>The game is played from a <a href="Third-person_view" title="wikilink">third-person perspective</a> and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An <a href="Multiplayer_video_game" title="wikilink">online multiplayer</a> mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting. Two <a href="expansion_pack" title="wikilink">expansion packs</a> were later released as <a href="downloadable_content" title="wikilink">downloadable content</a> for the game, <em><a href="Grand_Theft_Auto:_The_Lost_and_Damned" title="wikilink">The Lost and Damned</a></em> and <em><a href="Grand_Theft_Auto:_The_Ballad_of_Gay_Tony" title="wikilink">The Ballad of Gay Tony</a></em>, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> storyline, and follow new protagonists.</p>
<p>Development began in 2004, soon after the release of <em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em>. As part of their research for the open world, the developers conducted field research around New York throughout development and captured footage for the design team. Development duties were shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide.</p>
<p>Following its announcement in May 2006, <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> was widely anticipated.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It was acclaimed by many reviewers, with praise particularly directed at the game's narrative and open world design. The game also <a href="Controversies_surrounding_Grand_Theft_Auto_IV" title="wikilink">generated controversy</a>, with criticism directed at the game's depiction of violence and ability to <a href="Driving_under_the_influence" title="wikilink">drive under the influence of alcohol</a>. <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history at the time, earning US $310 million in its first day and US $500 million in its first week. Considered one of the most significant titles of the <a href="History_of_video_game_consoles_(seventh_generation)" title="wikilink">seventh generation</a> of video games, and by many critics as one of the <a href="List_of_video_games_considered_the_best" title="wikilink">greatest video games of all time</a>, it won year-end accolades, including <a href="Game_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">Game of the Year</a> awards from several <a href="Video_game_journalism" title="wikilink">gaming publications</a>. Its successor, <em><a href="Grand_Theft_Auto_V" title="wikilink">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em>, was released in September 2013.</p>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p><em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> is an <a href="action-adventure_game" title="wikilink">action-adventure game</a> played from a <a href="third-person_perspective" title="wikilink">third-person perspective</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Players complete missions&lt;U+2014&gt;linear scenarios with set objectives&lt;U+2014&gt;to progress through the story. It is possible to have several active missions running at one time, as some missions require players to wait for further instructions or events. Outside of missions, players can <a href="Nonlinear_gameplay" title="wikilink">freely roam</a> the game's <a href="open_world" title="wikilink">open world</a>, and have the ability to complete optional side missions. Composed of the fictional city of <a href="Liberty_City_(Grand_Theft_Auto)" title="wikilink">Liberty City</a>, the world of <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> is larger in area than most earlier entries in the series. At the beginning of the game, players can only explore the first island&lt;U+2013&gt;composed of Dukes and Broker&lt;U+2013&gt;with all other islands unlocking as the story progresses.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Players use <a href="Melee#Use_in_gaming" title="wikilink">melee</a> attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies, and may run, jump, swim or use vehicles to navigate the game's world. There is a <a href="first-person_perspective" title="wikilink">first-person perspective</a> option when using vehicles. In combat, <a href="auto-aim" class="uri" title="wikilink">auto-aim</a> and a <a href="cover_system" title="wikilink">cover system</a> can be used as assistance against enemies. Should players take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated using multiple techniques, such as eating, using medical kits, or calling for paramedics.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> If players commit crimes while playing, the game's law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a &quot;<a href="fugitive" title="wikilink">wanted</a>&quot; meter in the <a href="HUD_(video_gaming)" title="wikilink">head-up display</a> (HUD). On the meter, the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level (for example, at the maximum six-star level, efforts by law enforcement to incapacitate players become very aggressive). Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity. The wanted meter enters a cooldown mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers' line of sight.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Grand_Theft_Auto_IV_gameplay.jpg" title="fig:Combat in Grand Theft Auto IV was reworked to include a cover system.|alt=The player character positioned in cover behind a vehicle, preparing to shoot at police officers on the other side of the vehicle." alt="Combat in Grand Theft Auto IV was reworked to include a cover system.|alt=The player character positioned in cover behind a vehicle, preparing to shoot at police officers on the other side of the vehicle." /> The game's cover system allows players to deftly move between cover, to <a href="Blindfire" title="wikilink">fire blindly</a>, aim freely, and target a specific enemy. Individual body parts can also be targeted.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Melee attacks include additional moves, such as dodging, blocking, disarming an opponent and counter-attacking. <a href="Personal_armor" title="wikilink">Body armour</a> can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is used up in the process. When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops, and players <a href="Spawning_(video_game)" title="wikilink">respawn</a> at the nearest hospital.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The game's single-player mode lets players control a former veteran &lt;U+2013&gt; <a href="Eastern_Europe" title="wikilink">Eastern European</a> <a href="Niko_Bellic" title="wikilink">Niko Bellic</a>. During the story, Niko meets various new characters, many of which he befriends. These characters can then perform favours for Niko whenever he asks; for example, his cousin <a href="Roman_Bellic" title="wikilink">Roman</a>, who owns a taxi service, can send one of his <a href="Taxicab" title="wikilink">cabs</a> to Niko and take him to any destination around the city. Cabs are always available during gameplay, allowing players to quickly travel to a destination. Throughout the course of the game, players are also faced with <a href="morality" class="uri" title="wikilink">morality</a> choices, which alter the storyline appropriately depending on the player's choice. While free roaming the game world, players may engage in context-specific activities such as <a href="bowling" class="uri" title="wikilink">bowling</a> or <a href="darts" class="uri" title="wikilink">darts</a>. Other available activities include a <a href="vigilante" class="uri" title="wikilink">vigilante</a> minigame, and in-game television programming.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Niko has a <a href="smartphone" class="uri" title="wikilink">smartphone</a> for contacting friends and starting activities.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The smartphone is also used to access the game's online multiplayer mode, and to enter <a href="cheat_codes" title="wikilink">cheat codes</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> To access the in-game Internet, which allows Niko to send and receive emails and set up prospective <a href="Dating" title="wikilink">dates</a> with potential girlfriends, Niko can use <a href="Internet_caf&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Internet caf&lt;U+00E9&gt;s</a> located around the city.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The game also features a <a href="Rapid_transit" title="wikilink">subway system</a>, allowing players to quickly traverse through the game world.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
<h3 id="setting">Setting</h3>
<p><em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> takes place in 2008, in a redesigned version of <a href="Liberty_City_(Grand_Theft_Auto)" title="wikilink">Liberty City</a> consisting of four boroughs, based on four of the boroughs of New York City: Broker (based on <a href="Brooklyn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brooklyn</a>), Dukes (<a href="Queens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queens</a>), Bohan (<a href="The_Bronx" title="wikilink">The Bronx</a>), and Algonquin (<a href="Manhattan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a>).<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Adjacent to the city is the independent state of <em>Alderney</em> (Northern <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a>). There are three minor islands present in the game: Charge Island (<a href="Randall&#39;s_Island" title="wikilink">Randall's Island</a>), Colony Island (<a href="Roosevelt_Island" title="wikilink">Roosevelt Island</a>), and Happiness Island (<a href="Liberty_Island" title="wikilink">Liberty Island</a>). Initially, bridges are locked down due to a terrorist threat, and players are constantly pursued by police if the bridges are crossed, but the blockades are lifted as the story progresses, allowing the player to traverse between islands.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> takes place in a different storyline and timeline from the previous games in the <a href="Grand_Theft_Auto_(series)" title="wikilink">series</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> However, the game takes place in the same <a href="Canon_(fiction)" title="wikilink">canon</a> as its expansion packs, <em><a href="Grand_Theft_Auto:_The_Lost_and_Damned" title="wikilink">The Lost and Damned</a></em> and <em><a href="Grand_Theft_Auto:_The_Ballad_of_Gay_Tony" title="wikilink">The Ballad of Gay Tony</a></em>, and its successor, <em><a href="Grand_Theft_Auto_V" title="wikilink">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="plot">Plot</h3>

<p>In Liberty City, <a href="Niko_Bellic" title="wikilink">Niko Bellic</a>, an <a href="Eastern_Europe" title="wikilink">Eastern European</a>,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> arrives to meet his cousin <a href="Roman_Bellic" title="wikilink">Roman</a>. Niko comes to Liberty City to pursue the <a href="American_Dream" title="wikilink">American Dream</a>, and to search for the man who betrayed his unit in a war fifteen years prior. After his arrival, however, Niko quickly learns that Roman's tales of riches and luxury were lies concealing struggles with gambling debts and loan sharks, and that Roman lives in a dirty apartment rather than a mansion.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Niko defends Roman from his loan sharks several times, eventually killing <a href="List_of_Grand_Theft_Auto_IV_characters#Vlad_Glebov" title="wikilink">Vlad Glebov</a>, Roman's Russian loan shark. Niko was forced to work for Vlad due to Roman's debts but ended up killing him after learning that that he had slept with Roman's girlfriend, Mallorie.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> After Vlad's murder, Niko and Roman are kidnapped by members of the Liberty City <a href="Russian_mafia" title="wikilink">Bratva</a> on order of <a href="Mikhail_Faustin" title="wikilink">Mikhail Faustin</a> and his associate, <a href="Dimitri_Rascalov" title="wikilink">Dimitri Rascalov</a>. Faustin, not bothered by the murder of Vlad, hires Niko.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Niko quickly learns that Faustin is a psychopath when he orders him to kill the son of Kenny Petrovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, the most powerful man in the Liberty City Bratva. After the Petrovi&lt;U+0107&gt; family threatens retaliation, Dimitri orders Niko to assassinate Faustin.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> When Niko meets with Dimitri to collect on the assassination, Dimitri betrays him; when they meet, Dimitri brings Niko's former employer Ray Bulgarin, who accuses Niko of stealing from him. When Niko truthfully denies the allegation, a firefight ensues, allowing Dimitri and Bulgarin to escape.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, Niko and Roman are forced to escape to Bohan when their apartment and taxi company are destroyed in arson attacks by Dimitri's men.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> However, things go poorly in Bohan: Dimitri's men kidnap Roman in a failed bid to ambush and kill Niko, who rescues Roman.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Furthermore, one of the drug deals that Niko works on turns out to be a <a href="Sting_operation" title="wikilink">sting</a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> and another is busted. After the latter incident, Niko's current girlfriend <a href="List_of_Grand_Theft_Auto_IV_characters#Michelle/Karen" title="wikilink">Michelle</a> then reveals that she works for a government agency and <a href="Entrapment" title="wikilink">entraps</a> Niko into working for her agency, known only by its cover: <a href="List_of_Grand_Theft_Auto_IV_characters#United_Liberty_Paper" title="wikilink">United Liberty Paper</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Niko kills several known or suspected terrorists for the agency in exchange for the file of the numerous crimes the police have on him and the promise of assistance in finding the traitor of his unit.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>With the assistance of United Liberty Paper, Niko eventually tracks down the man responsible for his unit's betrayal: <a href="List_of_Grand_Theft_Auto_IV_characters#Darko_Brevic" title="wikilink">Darko Brevic</a>; Niko chooses Darko's fate.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Having dealt with his past, Niko is summoned by <a href="Pegorino_crime_family" title="wikilink">Jimmy Pegorino</a>, who demands one final favour after many favours: to help with an extremely lucrative deal on heroin in collusion with Dimitri Rascalov.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Niko is then faced with two choices: strike a deal with Dimitri, or seek revenge on him.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Should Niko go through with the deal, he soon finds out that Dimitri took the heroin for himself, which endangers and angers Niko.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> At Roman's wedding, an assassin sent by Dimitri kills Roman with a stray bullet as Niko disarms and kills him.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> A devastated and vengeful Niko later tracks down Dimitri and Pegorino, witnesses the former kill the latter, before chasing and killing Dimitri.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Should Niko choose to exact revenge, Niko ambushes and executes Dimitri.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> At Roman's wedding, Pegorino, furious after Niko's betrayal, commits a <a href="drive-by_shooting" title="wikilink">drive-by shooting</a>. He targets Niko, but ends up killing Niko's girlfriend <a href="List_of_Grand_Theft_Auto_IV_characters#Kate_McReary" title="wikilink">Kate</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Niko soon tracks down, chases, and kills Pegorino, who had become hated and targeted by the entire underworld of Liberty City.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

In one preview, a player knocked an NPC out of a window and the character grabbed onto a ledge to stop himself from falling.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The game also uses middleware from <a href="Image_Metrics" title="wikilink">Image Metrics</a> to facilitate intricate facial expressions and ease the process of incorporating lip-synching.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Foliage in the game is produced through <a href="SpeedTree" class="uri" title="wikilink">SpeedTree</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> sees a shift in the series to a more realistic and detailed style and tone,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> partly a result of the transition to consoles which offered <a href="High-definition_television" title="wikilink">high-definition</a> graphics and the new and improved capabilities of such consoles.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Rockstar co-founder <a href="Dan_Houser" title="wikilink">Dan Houser</a> said &quot;what we're taking as our watchword on [<em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em>] is the idea of what high definition actually means. Not just in terms of graphics, which obviously we are achieving, but in terms of all aspects of the design. [...] You know, trying to make something more realistic, more held together, but still retaining the overall coherence that the other games had.&quot;<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Art director Aaron Garbut said one of the reasons they decided to set the game in New York because &quot;we all knew what an amazing, diverse, vibrant, cinematic city it is,&quot; and since they were hoping the push the &quot;detail, variety and life&quot; to a high level, it seemed that &quot;basing the game in a city so synonymous with these things was a great fit.&quot;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Dan Houser added &quot;because we were working in high definition and we knew we'd need a shitload of research, we wanted to be somewhere where we had a foothold.&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The developers consciously avoided creating a block for block recreation of New York City, Dan Houser said &quot;what we've always tried to do is make a thing that looks real and has the qualities of a real environment, but is also fun from a game design perspective.&quot;<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> rendition of Liberty City is far more detailed and larger in size than most earlier entries in the series<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Although smaller than San Andreas, the main setting for <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em>'s predecessor <em><a href="Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas" title="wikilink">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></em>, Liberty City is comparable to it in terms of scope when &quot;the level of verticality of the city, the number of buildings you can go into, and the level of detail in those buildings&quot; are taken into account.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The goal for Liberty City was to have no dead spots or irrelevant spaces, such as the wide open deserts in San Andreas.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> To achieve a realistic environment, the Rockstar North team, based in <a href="Edinburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edinburgh</a>, Scotland, made two trips to New York for research, one at the start of the project (which was done with every previous <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> game) and another smaller one further into development.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> A full-time research team, based in New York, handled further requests for information ranging from the ethnic minority of a neighbourhood to videos of traffic patterns.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>The story of <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> was written by Dan Houser and Rupert Humphries.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Unlike previous <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> games which have a strong cultural or cinematic influence, &quot;[<em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> doesn't] really have any cinematic influences&quot;,<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> as explained by Houser. &quot;We were consciously trying to go, well, if video games are going to develop into the next stage, then the thing isn't to try and do a loving tribute or reference other stuff.
