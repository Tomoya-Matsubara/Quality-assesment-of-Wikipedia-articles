<p><strong>Christopher Greenup</strong> (c. 1750  April 27, 1818) was an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> politician who served as a <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">U.S. Representative</a> and the third <a href="Governor_of_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Governor of Kentucky</a>. Little is known about his early life; the first reliable records about him are documents recording his service in the <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">Revolutionary War</a> where he served as a <a href="lieutenant" class="uri" title="wikilink">lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Continental_Army" title="wikilink">Continental Army</a> and a <a href="colonel" class="uri" title="wikilink">colonel</a> in the <a href="Virginia_militia" title="wikilink">Virginia militia</a>.</p>
<p>After his service in the war, Greenup helped settle the trans-<a href="Appalachian_Mountains" title="wikilink">Appalachian</a> regions of Virginia. He became involved in politics, and played an active role in three of the ten statehood conventions that secured the separation of Kentucky from Virginia in 1792. He became one of the state's first representatives, and served in the <a href="Kentucky_General_Assembly" title="wikilink">Kentucky General Assembly</a> before being elected governor in a race where, due to his immense popularity, he ran unopposed.</p>
<p>Greenup's term in office was marred by accusations that he had participated in the <a href="Spanish_Conspiracy" title="wikilink">Spanish Conspiracy</a> to align Kentucky with <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a> prior to the former's separation from Virginia, but he vigorously and successfully rebutted these charges. Following his term as governor, he became less active in the political arena. He died on April 27, 1818. <a href="Greenup_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Greenup County, Kentucky</a> and its <a href="county_seat" title="wikilink">county seat</a> were both named in his honor.</p>

<p>When Kentucky was admitted to the Union in 1792, Greenup moved to Frankfort where he was rewarded for his efforts on behalf of the state by being chosen as an elector for the state's senators and governor.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He also served in the first <a href="Kentucky_Senate" title="wikilink">Kentucky Senate</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Following this, he was appointed to the court of <a href="oyer_and_terminer" title="wikilink">oyer and terminer</a>, but resigned immediately to accept a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He was one of Kentucky's first two representatives in the House, and was elected to three successive terms, serving from November 9, 1792 to March 3, 1797.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In 1798, he was elected to the <a href="Kentucky_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Kentucky House of Representatives</a>, representing Mercer County.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> He also served as clerk of the state senate from 1799 to 1802.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
