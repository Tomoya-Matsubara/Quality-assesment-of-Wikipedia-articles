The blood-brain barrier is formed by capillary endothelial cells, which are connected by <a href="tight_junction" title="wikilink">tight junctions</a> with an extremely high electrical resistance of at least 1000&lt;U+03A9&gt;cm<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;2</sup>. The blood-brain barrier allows the passage of water, some gases, and lipid soluble molecules by passive diffusion, as well as the selective transport of molecules such as glucose and amino acids that are crucial to neural function. On the other hand, the blood-brain barrier may prevent the entry of lipophilic, potential neurotoxins by way of an active transport mechanism mediated by P-glycoprotein. <a href="Astrocyte" title="wikilink">Astrocytes</a> are necessary to create the blood-brain barrier. A small number of regions in the brain, including the <a href="circumventricular_organ" title="wikilink">circumventricular organs</a> (CVOs), do not have a blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>The blood-brain barrier occurs along all capillaries and consists of <a href="tight_junction" title="wikilink">tight junctions</a> around the capillaries that do not exist in normal circulation.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="Endothelial_cell" title="wikilink">Endothelial cells</a> restrict the diffusion of microscopic objects (e.g., <a href="bacteria" class="uri" title="wikilink">bacteria</a>) and large or <a href="Hydrophile" title="wikilink">hydrophilic</a> molecules into the <a href="cerebrospinal_fluid" title="wikilink">cerebrospinal fluid</a> (CSF), while allowing the diffusion of small <a href="Hydrophobe" title="wikilink">hydrophobic</a> molecules (O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, hormones).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Cells of the barrier actively transport <a href="metabolism" title="wikilink">metabolic</a> products such as glucose across the barrier with specific proteins.

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><a href="Paul_Ehrlich" title="wikilink">Paul Ehrlich</a> was a <a href="bacteriology" title="wikilink">bacteriologist</a> studying <a href="staining" class="uri" title="wikilink">staining</a>, a procedure that is used in many microscopic studies to make fine biological structures visible using chemical dyes. As Ehrlich injected some of these dyes (notably the <a href="aniline_dye" title="wikilink">aniline dyes</a> that were then widely used), the dye stained all of the <a href="organ_(anatomy)" title="wikilink">organs</a> of some kinds of animals except for their <a href="brain" title="wikilink">brains</a>. At that time, Ehrlich attributed this lack of staining to the brain simply not picking up as much of the dye.</p>
<p>However, in a later experiment in 1913, <a href=":de:Edwin_Goldmann" title="wikilink">Edwin Goldmann</a> (one of Ehrlich's students) injected the dye into the <a href="cerebro-spinal_fluid" title="wikilink">cerebro-spinal fluids</a> of animals' brains directly. He found that in this case the brains did become dyed, but the rest of the body did not. This clearly demonstrated the existence of some sort of compartmentalization between the two. At that time, it was thought that the <a href="blood_vessel" title="wikilink">blood vessels</a> themselves were responsible for the barrier, since no obvious membrane could be found. The concept of the blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier (then termed <strong>hematoencephalic barrier</strong>) was proposed by a Berlin physician, Lewandowsky, in 1900.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> It was not until the introduction of the <a href="scanning_electron_microscope" title="wikilink">scanning electron microscope</a> to the medical research fields in the 1960s that the actual membrane could be observed and proved to exist.</p>
<h2 id="physiology">Physiology</h2>
<p><img src="Blood_vessels_brain_english.jpg" title="fig:Schematic sketch showing constitution of blood vessels inside the brain" alt="Schematic sketch showing constitution of blood vessels inside the brain" /> This &quot;barrier&quot; results from the selectivity of the <a href="tight_junctions" title="wikilink">tight junctions</a> between <a href="endothelial_cell" title="wikilink">endothelial cells</a> in CNS vessels that restricts the passage of solutes.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> At the interface between blood and the brain, endothelial cells are stitched together by these tight junctions, which are composed of smaller subunits, frequently biochemical <a href="dimer_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">dimers</a>, that are transmembrane proteins such as <a href="occludin" class="uri" title="wikilink">occludin</a>, <a href="claudins" class="uri" title="wikilink">claudins</a>, <a href="junctional_adhesion_molecule" title="wikilink">junctional adhesion molecule</a> (JAM), or ESAM, for example. Each of these <a href="transmembrane_protein" title="wikilink">transmembrane proteins</a> is anchored into the endothelial cells by another protein complex that includes zo-1 and associated proteins.</p>
<p>The blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier is composed of high-density cells restricting passage of substances from the bloodstream much more than do the endothelial cells in capillaries elsewhere in the body. <a href="Astrocyte" class="uri" title="wikilink">Astrocyte</a> cell projections called astrocytic feet (also known as &quot;<a href="glia_limitans" title="wikilink">glia limitans</a>&quot;) surround the endothelial cells of the BBB, providing biochemical support to those cells. The BBB is distinct from the quite similar <a href="blood&lt;U+2013&gt;cerebrospinal-fluid_barrier" title="wikilink">blood&lt;U+2013&gt;cerebrospinal-fluid barrier</a>, which is a function of the choroidal cells of the <a href="choroid_plexus" title="wikilink">choroid plexus</a>, and from the <a href="blood&lt;U+2013&gt;retinal_barrier" title="wikilink">blood&lt;U+2013&gt;retinal barrier</a>, which can be considered a part of the whole realm of such barriers.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Several areas of the human brain are not on the brain side of the BBB. Some examples of this include the <a href="circumventricular_organs" title="wikilink">circumventricular organs</a>, the roof of the third and fourth ventricles, capillaries in the pineal gland on the roof of the <a href="diencephalon" class="uri" title="wikilink">diencephalon</a> and the <a href="pineal_gland" title="wikilink">pineal gland</a>. The pineal gland secretes the hormone <a href="melatonin" class="uri" title="wikilink">melatonin</a> &quot;directly into the systemic circulation&quot;,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> thus melatonin is not affected by the blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>Originally, experiments in the 1920s showed that the blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier (BBB) was still immature in newborns. The reason for this fallacy was a mistake in methodology (the osmotic pressure was too high and the delicate embryonal capillary vessels were partially damaged). It was later shown in experiments with a reduced volume of the injected liquids that the markers under investigation could not pass the BBB. It was reported that those natural substances such as albumin, &lt;U+03B1&gt;-1-fetoprotein or transferrin with elevated plasma concentration in the newborn could not be detected outside of cells in the brain. The <a href="ATP-binding_cassette_transporter" title="wikilink">transporter P-glycoprotein</a> exists already in the embryonal endothelium.</p>

These data confirmed no differences in permeability could be detected between newborn and adult BBB capillaries. No difference in brain uptake of glucose, <a href="amino_acids" title="wikilink">amino acids</a>, organic acids, purines, nucleosides, or choline was observed between adult and newborn rabbits. These experiments indicate that the newborn BBB has restrictive properties similar to that of the adult. In contrast to suggestions of an immature barrier in young animals, these studies indicate that a sophisticated, selective BBB is operative at birth.</p>
<h2 id="pathophysiology">Pathophysiology</h2>
<p>The blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier acts very effectively to protect the brain from many common bacterial <a href="infection" title="wikilink">infections</a>. Thus, infections of the brain are very rare. Infections of the brain that do occur are often very serious and difficult to treat. <a href="Antibodies" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antibodies</a> are too large to cross the blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier, and only certain <a href="antibiotics" class="uri" title="wikilink">antibiotics</a> are able to pass.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In some cases the <a href="pharmacon" class="uri" title="wikilink">pharmacon</a> has to be administered directly into the <a href="Cerebrospinal_fluid" title="wikilink">Cerebrospinal fluid</a>. However, drugs delivered directly to the CSF do not effectively penetrate into the brain tissue itself, possibly due to the tortuous nature of the interstitial space in the brain.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier becomes more permeable during inflammation. This allows some antibiotics and <a href="phagocytes" class="uri" title="wikilink">phagocytes</a> to move across the BBB. However, this also allows bacteria and viruses to infiltrate the BBB.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> An exception to the bacterial exclusion is the diseases caused by <a href="spirochete" title="wikilink">spirochetes</a>, such as <em><a href="Borrelia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Borrelia</a></em>, which causes <a href="Lyme_disease" title="wikilink">Lyme disease</a>, and <em><a href="Treponema_pallidum" title="wikilink">Treponema pallidum</a></em>, which causes <a href="syphilis" class="uri" title="wikilink">syphilis</a>. These harmful bacteria seem to breach the blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier by physically tunneling through the blood vessel walls.</p>
<p>There are also some biochemical poisons that are made up of large molecules that are too big to pass through the blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier. This was especially important in more primitive times when people often ate contaminated food. <a href="Neurotoxins" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neurotoxins</a> such as <a href="Botulism" title="wikilink">Botulinum</a> in the food might affect peripheral nerves, but the blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier can often prevent such toxins from reaching the central nervous system, where they could cause serious or fatal damage.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="drugs-targeting-the-brain">Drugs targeting the brain</h2>
<p>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is formed by the brain capillary endothelium and excludes from the brain &lt;U+223C&gt;100% of large-molecule neurotherapeutics and more than 98% of all small-molecule drugs.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Overcoming the difficulty of delivering therapeutic agents to specific regions of the brain presents a major challenge to treatment of most brain disorders. In its neuroprotective role, the blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier functions to hinder the delivery of many potentially important diagnostic and therapeutic agents to the brain. Therapeutic molecules and antibodies that might otherwise be effective in diagnosis and therapy do not cross the BBB in adequate amounts.</p>
<p>Mechanisms for drug targeting in the brain involve going either &quot;through&quot; or &quot;behind&quot; the BBB. Modalities for <a href="drug_delivery" title="wikilink">drug delivery</a>/<a href="Dosage_form" title="wikilink">Dosage form</a> through the BBB entail its disruption by <a href="osmosis" title="wikilink">osmotic</a> means; biochemically by the use of vasoactive substances such as <a href="bradykinin" class="uri" title="wikilink">bradykinin</a>; or even by localized exposure to <a href="HIFU" title="wikilink">high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Other methods used to get through the BBB may entail the use of endogenous transport systems, including carrier-mediated transporters such as glucose and amino acid carriers; receptor-mediated <a href="transcytosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">transcytosis</a> for <a href="insulin" class="uri" title="wikilink">insulin</a> or <a href="transferrin" class="uri" title="wikilink">transferrin</a>; and the blocking of active efflux transporters such as <a href="p-glycoprotein" class="uri" title="wikilink">p-glycoprotein</a>. Methods for drug delivery behind the BBB include intracerebral implantation (such as with needles) and convection-enhanced distribution. <a href="Mannitol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mannitol</a> can be used in bypassing the BBB.</p>
<h3 id="nanoparticles">Nanoparticles</h3>
<p><a href="Nanotechnology" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nanotechnology</a> may also help in the transfer of drugs across the BBB.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Recently, researchers have been trying to build <a href="liposomes" class="uri" title="wikilink">liposomes</a> loaded with nanoparticles to gain access through the BBB. More research is needed to determine which strategies will be most effective and how they can be improved for patients with <a href="brain_tumor" title="wikilink">brain tumors</a>. The potential for using BBB opening to target specific agents to brain tumors has just begun to be explored.</p>
<p>Delivering drugs across the blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier is one of the most promising applications of nanotechnology in clinical neuroscience. Nanoparticles could potentially carry out multiple tasks in a predefined sequence, which is very important in the delivery of drugs across the blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier.</p>
<p>A significant amount of research in this area has been spent exploring methods of nanoparticle-mediated delivery of <a href="antineoplastic" class="uri" title="wikilink">antineoplastic</a> drugs to tumors in the central nervous system. For example, radiolabeled <a href="polyethylene_glycol" title="wikilink">polyethylene glycol</a> coated hexadecylcyanoacrylate nanospheres targeted and accumulated in a rat gliosarcoma.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> However, this method is not yet ready for clinical trials, due to the accumulation of the nanospheres in surrounding healthy tissue.</p>
<p>It should be noted that vascular endothelial cells and associated <a href="pericytes" class="uri" title="wikilink">pericytes</a> are often abnormal in tumors and that the blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier may not always be intact in brain tumors. Also, the <a href="basement_membrane" title="wikilink">basement membrane</a> is sometimes incomplete. Other factors, such as <a href="astrocytes" class="uri" title="wikilink">astrocytes</a>, may contribute to the resistance of brain tumors to therapy.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="peptides">Peptides</h3>
<p>Peptides are able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through various mechanisms, opening new diagnostic and therapeutic avenues.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> However, their BBB transport data are scattered in the literature over different disciplines, using different methodologies reporting different influx or efflux aspects. Therefore, a comprehensive BBB peptide database (Brainpeps) was constructed to collect the BBB data available in the literature. Brainpeps currently contains BBB transport information with positive as well as negative results. The database is a useful tool to prioritize peptide choices for evaluating different BBB responses or studying quantitative structure-property (BBB behaviour) relationships of peptides. Because a multitude of methods have been used to assess the BBB behaviour of compounds, we classified these methods and their responses. Moreover, the relationships between the different BBB transport methods have been clarified and visualized.</p>

When the meninges are inflamed, the blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier may be disrupted.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> This disruption may increase the penetration of various substances (including either <a href="toxin" title="wikilink">toxins</a> or antibiotics) into the brain.

<p>A brain or cerebral abscess, like other <a href="abscess" title="wikilink">abscesses</a> is caused by inflammation and collection of lymphatic cells and infected material originating from a local or remote infection. Brain abscess is a rare, life-threatening condition. Local sources may include infections of the ear, the oral cavity and teeth, the paranasal sinuses, or epidural abscess. Remote sources may include infections in the lung, heart or kidney. A brain abscess may also be caused by head trauma or as a complication of surgery.

These findings have led to the hypotheses that (1) breakdown of the blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier allows access of neuron-binding autoantibodies and soluble exogenous A&lt;U+03B2&gt;42 to brain neurons and (2) binding of these auto-antibodies to neurons triggers and/or facilitates the internalization and accumulation of cell surface-bound A&lt;U+03B2&gt;42 in vulnerable neurons through their natural tendency to clear surface-bound autoantibodies via <a href="endocytosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">endocytosis</a>. Eventually the astrocyte is overwhelmed, dies, ruptures, and disintegrates, leaving behind the insoluble A&lt;U+03B2&gt;42 plaque. Thus, in some patients, Alzheimer's disease may be caused (or more likely, aggravated) by a breakdown in the blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="cerebral-edema">Cerebral edema</h3>
<p>Cerebral edema is the accumulation of excess water in the extracellular space of the brain, which can result when hypoxia causes the blood-brain barrier to open.</p>
<h2 id="prion-and-prion-like-diseases">Prion and prion-like Diseases</h2>
<p>Many neurodegenerative diseases including alpha-synucleinopathies (Parkinsons, PSP, DLBP) and tauopathies (Alzheimer's) are thought to result from seeded misfolding from pathological extracellular protein variants. This prion-like hypothesis is gaining support in numerous studies in vitro and involving in vivo intracerebral injection of brain lysates, extracted protein (tau, alpha-synuclein) and synthetically generated fibers (PFFs in alpha-synucleinopathies). These proteins are also detectable in increasing amounts in the plasma of patients suffering from these conditions (particularly total alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease patients). The extent to which and the mechanisms by which these prion-like proteins can penetrate the blood brain barrier is currently unknown.</p>
<h3 id="hiv-encephalitis">HIV encephalitis</h3>
<p>It is believed<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> that latent <a href="HIV" class="uri" title="wikilink">HIV</a> can cross the blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier inside circulating monocytes in the bloodstream (&quot;<a href="Trojan_horse" title="wikilink">Trojan horse</a> theory&quot;) within the first 14 days of infection. Once inside, these monocytes become activated and are transformed into macrophages. Activated macrophages release virions into the brain tissue proximate to brain microvessels. These viral particles likely attract the attention of sentinel brain microglia and perivascular macrophages initiating an inflammatory cascade that may cause a series of intracellular signaling in brain microvascular endothelial cells and damage the functional and structural integrity of the BBB.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> This inflammation is HIV encephalitis (HIVE). Instances of HIVE probably occur throughout the course of AIDS and are a precursor for <a href="HIV-associated_dementia" title="wikilink">HIV-associated dementia</a> (HAD). The premier model for studying HIV and HIVE is the simian model.</p>
<h3 id="rabies">Rabies</h3>
<p>During lethal <a href="rabies" class="uri" title="wikilink">rabies</a> infection of mice, the blood&lt;U+2013&gt;brain barrier (BBB) does not allow anti-viral immune cells to enter the brain, the primary site of rabies virus replication. This aspect contributes to the pathogenicity of the virus and artificially increasing BBB permeability promotes viral clearance. Opening the BBB during rabies infection has been suggested as a possible novel approach to treating the disease, even though no attempts have yet been made to determine whether or not this treatment could be successful.</p>
