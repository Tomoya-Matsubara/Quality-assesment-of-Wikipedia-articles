Snylyk graduated with a <a href="bachelor&lt;U+2019&gt;s_degree" title="wikilink">bachelor&lt;U+2019&gt;s degree</a> in <a href="political_science" title="wikilink">political science</a> in 1955 and was inducted into the University of Rocherster Hall of Fame in 2005.<sup><a href="http://www.rochester.edu/athletics/article.php?id=1244">1</a></sup> In addition to graduating from Rochester in 1955, he also gained his U.S. citizenship that year.</p>
<p>He earned a <a href="master&lt;U+2019&gt;s_degree" title="wikilink">master&lt;U+2019&gt;s degree</a> from the <a href="University_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">University of Chicago</a> in 1958.

<h2 id="club-career">Club career</h2>
<p>Snylyk began his organized soccer career with a team his father founded in Rochester, the Ukrainian American Sports Association of Rochester (also known as the <em>Rochester Ukrainian</em>). He would play with the Ukrainians from 1950 to 1955, then again in 1957. In 1957, the Ukrainians lost, 1-0, to <a href="St._Louis_Kutis_S.C." title="wikilink">St. Louis Kutis</a> in the National Amateur Cup final.<sup><a href="http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/natamateur.html">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Over the years, he played for multiple teams, at time traveling by plane to make games in both Canada and the United States. In 1955, Snylyk joined the Ukraina Montreal following the completion of Rochester&lt;U+2019&gt;s season. He then played in Montreal until 1957, when he joined Rochester for its run to the Amateur Cup final. Montreal finished league runner up in 1955 and champion in 1957.</p>
<p>At times Snylyk would play simultaneously for teams in the U.S. and Canada. While he could do this due to the off set seasons, at times he was forced to travel from one game to another by airplane. For example, while playing for Ukraina Montreal, Snylyk also played with Chicago Levy in 1956, then from 1958 to 1961. At some point in there, he also played for Ukraina Toronto and while teaching at McGill University of Montreal in 1959-1960, he would fly to New York to play games with the Ukrainian Sports Club.</p>
<p>In 1962, Snylky moved to <a href="Newark,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Newark, New Jersey</a> to manage a newspaper. While there, he signed with <a href="Newark_Ukrainian_Sitch" title="wikilink">Newark Ukrainian Sitch</a> (also known as <em>Chornomorska Sitch</em>) of the <a href="American_Soccer_League" title="wikilink">American Soccer League</a> (ASL). He remained with this, his last club, until his retirement in 1970. In 1963, Sitch won the ASL League Cup, known as a the Lewis Cup.</p>
<h2 id="olympic-team">Olympic team</h2>
<p>Beginning a year after he gained his U.S. citizenship, Snylyk began representing the U.S. at the international level. In 1956, he was selected to be the captain of the <a href="United_States_at_the_1956_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">U.S. soccer team</a> which competed at the <a href="Football_at_the_1956_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1956 Summer Olympics</a>. The U.S. took a tour of Asia in preparation for the games. Despite good success at these friendly matches, the U.S. lost, 9-1, to Yugoslavia in the first round.</p>

<p>In 1959, Snylyk was again selected as captain of the U.S. soccer team as it entered qualification for the <a href="1960_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1960 Summer Olympics</a>. This time a loss and a tie to Mexico in the first round of qualification put the U.S. out of contention for the tournament. In 1964, Snylyk was called into his third consecutive Olympic soccer team, but again the U.S. failed to qualify for the tournament with a 1-2 record in qualifications.</p>
<h2 id="pan-american-games">Pan American Games</h2>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, most players on the U.S. national team were amateurs. This allowed them to play both in full internationals and in the Olympics and <a href="Pan_American_Games" title="wikilink">Pan American Games</a> which were fully amateur at the time. In 1959, Snylyk was selected for the U.S. soccer team at the <a href="Football_at_the_1959_Pan_American_Games" title="wikilink">1959 Pan Am Games</a>, held in Chicago. Just as with the Olympic squad, Snylyk was team captain of the U.S. as it captured the bronze medal in these games. On August 29, 1959, the U.S. defeated Brazil 5-3. However, this was also Snylyk&lt;U+2019&gt;s wedding day. He played the game, then drove, along with his team mates, to the church where he married Yara Matura, a native of Chicago. Following the reception, he went back to the competitors&lt;U+2019&gt; compound to sleep.</p>
<p>Snylyk competed in the <a href="Football_at_the_1963_Pan_American_Games" title="wikilink">1963 Pan Am Games</a>. However, the U.S. was not as successful, finishing last and losing 10-0 to Brazil in the process.</p>

In 1957, he played two World Cup qualification games. The first, a 6-0 loss to <a href="Mexico_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Mexico</a> took place on April 7, 1956. On November 13, 1960, he was team captain as the U.S. lost 3-0 to <a href="Mexico_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Mexico</a> in <a href="Mexico_City" title="wikilink">Mexico City</a> in a World Cup qualifier.

<p><a href="Eugene_Chyzowych" title="wikilink">Eugene Chyzowych</a>, who played with Snylyk at Rochester, later wrote, &lt;U+201C&gt;He was the most intelligent tactician I ever played with. . . . Zenon had no size or strength, but skills and speed of thought would compensate for duels and tackles other players would get into.&lt;U+201D&gt;<sup><a href="http://www.rochester.edu/pr/Review/V65N3/letters.html">4</a></sup></p>
