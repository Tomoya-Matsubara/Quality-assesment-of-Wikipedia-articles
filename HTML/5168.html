<p><strong>William Richard &quot;Bill&quot; Keating</strong> (born September 6, 1952) is an American politician who has served as a <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">U.S. Representative</a> from <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a> since 2011. He is a <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democrat</a> representing the state's , which includes <a href="Cape_Cod" title="wikilink">Cape Cod</a> and the surrounding region. Keating raised his profile advocating for criminal justice issues in the <a href="Massachusetts_General_Court" title="wikilink">state legislature</a> before becoming <a href="district_attorney" title="wikilink">district attorney</a> (DA) of <a href="Norfolk_County,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Norfolk County</a>, where he served three terms prior to his election to Congress.</p>
<p>Born and raised in <a href="Norwood,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Norwood, Massachusetts</a>, Keating &quot;took a traditional route to politics&quot;,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> attending <a href="Boston_College" title="wikilink">Boston College</a> and <a href="Suffolk_University_Law_School" title="wikilink">Suffolk University Law School</a>. As a resident of <a href="Sharon,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Sharon</a> he was elected to the <a href="Massachusetts_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Massachusetts House of Representatives</a> in 1976 and went on to serve in the state <a href="Massachusetts_Senate" title="wikilink">Senate</a> from 1985 to 1999. He authored numerous bills, signed into law, concerning taxation, drug crime, and sentencing reform. His attempted overthrow of Senate President <a href="William_M._Bulger" title="wikilink">William M. Bulger</a> in 1994 was a failure but boosted his local name recognition, which contributed to his success in the 1998 election for DA.</p>
<p>He followed the path of former Norfolk DA <a href="Bill_Delahunt" title="wikilink">Bill Delahunt</a> to Congress, winning election in 2010 to represent the <a href="Massachusetts&#39;s_10th_congressional_district" title="wikilink">10th district</a>. Due to census redistricting which would have placed him in competition against a fellow Representative, in 2012 he chose to run in the &quot;incumbent-free&quot; 9th district, where he was elected to a second term. As of the <a href="113th_United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">113th Congress</a> (2013&lt;U+2013&gt;2014), Keating sits on the House <a href="United_States_House_Committee_on_Homeland_Security" title="wikilink">Homeland Security Committee</a> and the <a href="United_States_House_Committee_on_Foreign_Affairs" title="wikilink">Foreign Affairs Committee</a>. Much of his work has focused on domestic issues central to his district, such as the fishing industry and nuclear safety.</p>

<p>Keating was born in <a href="Norwood,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Norwood, Massachusetts</a> in 1952 to Anna (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Welch) and William B. Keating. Graduating from <a href="Sharon_High_School" title="wikilink">Sharon High School</a>, Keating enrolled in <a href="Boston_College" title="wikilink">Boston College</a> where he received his <a href="Bachelor_of_Arts" title="wikilink">Bachelor of Arts</a> in 1974, and his <a href="Masters_of_Business_Administration" title="wikilink">Masters of Business Administration</a> in 1982. In 1985 Keating earned his <a href="Juris_Doctor" title="wikilink">Juris Doctor</a> from <a href="Suffolk_University_Law_School" title="wikilink">Suffolk University Law School</a> and passed the <a href="Massachusetts_Bar_Association" title="wikilink">bar exam</a>. Keating later became a partner at the law firm of <em>Keating &amp; Fishman</em>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="house-of-representatives">House of Representatives</h3>
<p>In 1977 Keating was elected to the <a href="Massachusetts_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Massachusetts House of Representatives</a> from the 19th <a href="Norfolk_County,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Norfolk</a> district, where he served for a year, and was later elected from the 8th Norfolk district, serving from 1979 to 1984.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He was a supporter of <a href="George_Keverian" title="wikilink">George Keverian</a> in his successful 1985 effort to overthrow <a href="Thomas_W._McGee" title="wikilink">Thomas W. McGee</a> as Speaker of the House.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> By the end of his House tenure, Keating became vice chairman of the House Criminal Justice Committee.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="senate">Senate</h3>
<p>In 1984, state Sen. <a href="Joseph_F._Timilty_(state_senator)" title="wikilink">Joseph F. Timilty</a> resigned his Norfolk and <a href="Suffolk_County,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Suffolk</a> seat to pursue a career in private law, and Keating became the only major Democratic contender for the office. In the general election he faced <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> Marion Boch, who promoted a plan for dramatic cuts to legislators' pay and hours, invoking the energy of the <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Ronald Reagan</a> campaign. Keating focused his campaign on expanding resources for crime prevention and education, tailoring his message to the Boston constituency he would pick up as a senator.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He was successful, winning about 64 percent of the vote, and was sworn in the following January.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In his first year he was named Senate chairman of the joint Public Safety Committee, where he led the legislative action for a statewide <a href="seat_belt_legislation_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">seat belt law</a> pushed by Governor <a href="Michael_Dukakis" title="wikilink">Michael Dukakis</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> He authored a drug sentencing reform package signed into law in 1988, lowering thresholds for possession charges and establishing new minimum sentences, including a one-year minimum sentence for first-time possession of <a href="cocaine" class="uri" title="wikilink">cocaine</a> or <a href="phencyclidine" title="wikilink">PCP</a> &quot;with intent to distribute&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The latter provision was widely derided by criminal justice authorities as excessively strict and vaguely worded.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Redistricting eventually placed Keating in the Norfolk and <a href="Bristol_County,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Bristol</a> seat (1989&lt;U+2013&gt;1994).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> As a vice chairman of the joint Criminal Justice Committee, Keating was a lead author of a 1991 sentencing reform bill, signed into law by Governor <a href="William_Weld" title="wikilink">William Weld</a>, that made it easier to try juveniles as adults and pass harsher sentences in the case of major crimes, especially murder. &quot;What is occuring is a shift away from the rehabilitative stance to a focus on the seriousness of the crime committed by the juvenile,&quot; said Keating.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In 1992, as co-chairman of the Taxation Committee, he successfully pushed a proposal to phase out the Massachusetts <a href="estate_tax" title="wikilink">estate tax</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1994 Keating led a group of liberals in a failed <a href="Coup_d&#39;&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat" title="wikilink">coup</a> to remove state Senate President <a href="William_M._Bulger" title="wikilink">William Bulger</a>, a fellow Democrat, from his position. Keating, a staunch liberal relative to the more socially conservative Bulger, sought to reform the Senate rules to greatly reduce the president's power. Bulger, who had held the Senate gavel for 15 years, exerted strict control over the body's operations, but was gradually losing his power base with new crops of Democratic freshmen replacing his longtime allies.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Keating's campaign failed, but he said during his 2010 election campaign: &quot;The thought that I took on the most powerful person in Massachusetts, risking my whole career, a member of my own party, is something that is resonating in this campaign, that helps define me as independent.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Further redistricting landed Keating in the Norfolk, Bristol, and <a href="Plymouth_County,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Plymouth</a> district from 1995 to 1998.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Throughout his Senate tenure, Keating served as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chairman of the Committee on Taxation, and Vice Chairman of the Committee on Criminal Justice; he also served as the Senate Chairman of the Committee on Public Safety and Chairman of the Steering and Policy Committee.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="district-attorney">District attorney</h2>
<p>Speculation emerged in early 1997 that Keating was planning a run for <a href="district_attorney" title="wikilink">district attorney</a> (DA) of Norfolk County.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> He faced two former Norfolk assistant DAs, John J. Corrigan and William P. O'Donnell, in the Democratic primary. Keating, whose name recognition was boosted by the attempted Bulger coup, presented his work on public safety, criminal justice, and judiciary committees as a strength, while the other candidates pointed to his lack of courtroom experience as a disqualifier. While Keating held a part-time law practice during his legislative career, he lacked exposure to the criminal cases handled by the DA's office.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> After winning the Democratic nomination, Keating faced incumbent DA Jeffrey A. Locke in the November 1998 general election. Locke, a Republican, had been appointed to the position by Governor Weld the previous year after the resignation of <a href="Bill_Delahunt" title="wikilink">Bill Delahunt</a>. With years of experience as a prosecutor, Locke portrayed Keating as a career politician and echoed his primary opponents' criticism of his experience. Keating highlighted a range of endorsements from police organizations, and from Delahunt, as evidence of his criminal justice qualifications. Aided by a Democratic-leaning electorate, Keating won the election with around 55 percent of the vote.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Upon taking office in January 1999, he immediately replaced two top officials, and one-third of the remaining staff were replaced or left voluntarily. Press reports criticized the move as overly political and aggressive, particularly as it affected ongoing trials.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In his first year he founded the Norfolk Anti-Crime Council, a 35-member forum for judicial officers, police, and other local parties to discuss and co-ordinate anti-crime strategies. He established a pilot program for a <a href="drug_court" title="wikilink">drug court</a> under Quincy District Court, which would provide an alternative sentencing pathway for nonviolent drug offenders, in an effort to reduce court backlogs and lower recidivism rates. He also expanded his office's juvenile crime unit.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In late 2000 he laid the groundwork for the Norfolk Country Children's Advocacy Center, based on similar programs in <a href="Middlesex_County,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Middlesex</a> and <a href="Suffolk_County,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Suffolk</a> counties,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and it was fully established the following year.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Keating's office also began an anti-bullying program in spring 2001.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In 2002, his office was the first in Massachusetts to win a murder conviction in a case that lacked a victim's body.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>In advance of the 2002 elections, he was seen as a likely contender to succeed deceased Rep. <a href="Joe_Moakley" title="wikilink">Joe Moakley</a> in the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">U.S. House of Representatives</a>, but he opted to run for a second term as DA instead,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and was unopposed for re-election.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> He won a third term, still unopposed, in 2006.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="elections">Elections</h3>
<p>With incumbent Bill Delahunt choosing to retire, Keating declared his candidacy in the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_Massachusetts,_2010#District_10" title="wikilink">2010 congressional election</a>. On September 14, he won the Democratic primary against state senator <a href="Robert_O&#39;Leary" title="wikilink">Robert O'Leary</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Keating faced Republican state Representative <a href="Jeff_Perry_(politician)" title="wikilink">Jeff Perry</a> in the general election. In the wake of the <a href="Tea_Party_movement" title="wikilink">Tea Party movement</a> and the election of Republican U.S. Senator <a href="Scott_Brown" title="wikilink">Scott Brown</a>, the campaign was unusually close for a modern Massachusetts race, which would normally skew heavily Democratic. The Keating campaign largely focused on a 1991 incident during Perry's tenure as a police sergeant, in which a teenage girl had been illegally strip-searched by another officer while Perry was on the scene. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran a widely aired advertisement highlighting the incident and challenging Perry's character.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> With 47 percent of the vote, Keating defeated Perry (42 percent) and two independents, in the November 2 election.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>With the state poised to lose a congressional seat after the <a href="2010_United_States_Census" title="wikilink">2010 census</a>, lawmakers released a redistricting plan in November 2011 that placed Keating into the same congressional district as <a href="Stephen_Lynch_(politician)" title="wikilink">Stephen Lynch</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Under the plan, the cities of Quincy and other upper South Shore towns were placed into Lynch's district, potentially forcing a primary between the two lawmakers. Instead of campaigning against his fellow Congressman in the 2012 election, Keating chose to move to his summer home in <a href="Cape_Cod" title="wikilink">Cape Cod</a>, to run in an &quot;incumbent-free&quot; district. Keating defeated Bristol County District Attorney Samuel Sutter in the September 6 Democratic primary, and in November 2012 he defeated Republican Christopher Sheldon to win a second term in the U.S. House.</p>

<p><img src="William_R_Keating.jpg" title="fig:Keating giving a speech in October 2010" alt="Keating giving a speech in October 2010" width="200" /> Keating is considered a <a href="liberalism_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">liberal</a> by national standards. In 2012, the <em><a href="National_Journal" title="wikilink">National Journal</a></em> ranked Keating as &quot;the 84th most liberal member of the House&quot;, but second only to Stephen Lynch as the most <a href="conservatism_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">conservative</a> of the Massachusetts House delegation.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="economic-issues-and-budget">Economic issues and budget</h4>
<p>Issues specific to his Cape Cod&lt;U+2013&gt;based district, such as maritime policy, have been a major target of Keating's work. In June 2012, he organized the Federal Fishing Advisory Board, a body to research and address <a href="fisheries_management" title="wikilink">fisheries management</a> concerns between lawmakers and industry stakeholders.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> In 2012 he and his Massachusetts peers successfully pushed the <a href="United_States_Department_of_Commerce" title="wikilink">Commerce Department</a> to issue a federal disaster declaration for fisheries in the northeastern U.S., which would open up the opportunity for financial aid.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> In the wake of <a href="Hurricane_Sandy" title="wikilink">Hurricane Sandy</a>, he proposed to redirect $111 million of relief funding to fisheries throughout the country, although the proposal was not adopted by the House Rules Committee.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>When the <a href="Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission" title="wikilink">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a> considered a 20-year contract extension for the <a href="Pilgrim_Nuclear_Generating_Station" title="wikilink">Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station</a> in the Cape Cod town of <a href="Plymouth,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Plymouth</a> in mid-2012, Keating repeatedly took to the press. He at first declined to take a position on the plant's re-authorization, stating, &quot;I wouldn't be the right person to ask and that's why we have regulatory authorities and people with expertise to deal with that.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> When the commission voted to renew the license, Keating joined other Massachusetts politicians in deriding the decision as premature.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> During a labor strike later in the year, Keating joined U.S. Representative <a href="Ed_Markey" title="wikilink">Ed Markey</a> in challenging the qualifications of the plant's replacement workers.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Along with U.S. Senator <a href="John_Kerry" title="wikilink">John Kerry</a>, Keating helped to finalize the cleanup and sale of portions of a defunct naval air base in <a href="South_Weymouth,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">South Weymouth</a> to private developers. The deal, reached in November 2011, was a linchpin for the SouthField development project.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Keating has stressed his opposition to <a href="Social_Security_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Social Security</a> reductions such as raising the retirement age or privatizing the program,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> and supported a <a href="cost-of-living_adjustment" title="wikilink">cost-of-living adjustment</a> announced by the <a href="Social_Security_Administration" title="wikilink">Social Security Administration</a> in 2011.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2011, Keating had a 100% voting record with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (<a href="AFL&lt;U+2013&gt;CIO" class="uri" title="wikilink">AFL&lt;U+2013&gt;CIO</a>), backing all 29 endorsed bills.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> During 2012, Keating voted in favor of 10 of 12 AFL-CIO backed bills, with the two opposing votes dealing with small business startups and swap dealer exclusions.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Overall, Keating's has support 95% of AFL-CIO endorsed legislation.
