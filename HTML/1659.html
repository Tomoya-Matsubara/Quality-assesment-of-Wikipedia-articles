<p>Millis was a firm believer in &quot;practical&quot; economics and labor relations, the idea that an academic should not merely study from afar but should actively participate in the practice of his or her subjects. Accordingly, Millis agreed to serve on a number of public boards, commissions, and agencies throughout his life. He served as a staff economist and field investigator for the <a href="Dillingham_Commission" title="wikilink">United States Immigration Commission</a> from 1908 to 1910, studying Asian immigration on the <a href="West_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">West Coast</a> and in the <a href="Mountain_States" title="wikilink">Rocky Mountain states</a> and authoring a three-volume report on the issue.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> He was director of the Illinois Health Insurance Commission from 1918 to 1919, where he oversaw the first large-scale effort to collect health statistics, assess the health of the citizenry, study the implementation of health laws, and make policy recommendations regarding health insurance.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>From 1919 to 1921, he was chairman of the Trade Board of the Chicago Men's Clothing Industry, where he helped mediate labor disputes in the textile industry.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> He was chairman of the Trade Board's Arbitration Committee from 1923 to 1924 and again from 1937 to 1940.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="first-nlrb">&quot;First&quot; NLRB</h3>
<p>In 1934, Millis was named a member of the &quot;first&quot; National Labor Relations Board. On June 16, 1933, President <a href="Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> signed the <a href="National_Industrial_Recovery_Act" title="wikilink">National Industrial Recovery Act</a> (NIRA) into law. Title I, Section 7(a) of the Act guaranteed the right of workers to form unions, and it set off a massive wave of union organizing punctuated by employer and union violence, <a href="general_strike" title="wikilink">general strikes</a>, and <a href="recognition_strike" title="wikilink">recognition strikes</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Although it was felt Section 7(a) would be self-policing, that assumption failed almost immediately.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> On August 5, 1933, President Roosevelt announced that the <a href="National_Recovery_Administration" title="wikilink">National Recovery Administration</a> was being instructed to establish a <a href="National_Labor_Board" title="wikilink">National Labor Board</a> (NLB) to administer Section 7(a).<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> (Millis served as the vice-chair of the NLB's Chicago office.)<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> But the NLB provded ineffective without any statutory or regulatory powers, so Roosevelt issued <a href="Executive_order_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Executive Order</a> 6511 on December 16, 1933, to strengthen the NLB and give it the forced of executive authority.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> But this, too, proved too little to deal with the tremendous labor relations problems facing the country. Finally, threatened with a major strike in the steel industry and a Senate labor relations bill moving forward without presidential input, Roosevelt personally drafted Public Resolution No. 44, a bill which authorized the president to create one or more new labor boards to enforce Section 7(a) by conducting investigations, subpoenaeing evidence and witnesses, holding elections and issuing orders.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> It passed both houses of Congress on June 16, and Roosevelt signed it into law on June 19, 1934.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6073 on June 29, 1934, which abolished the NLB and established the National Labor Relations Board.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The three-person board was empowered to hold hearings and make findings of fact, investigate violations of Section 7(a), and hold union organizing elections to resolve labor disputes.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Millis expressed no interest in serving on the NLRB.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Nontheless, he was asked to join the new board based on his national reputation as an arbitrator, and agreed to do so.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Millis was sworn in as a member of the &quot;first&quot; NLRB on July 9, 1934.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>Millis played a role in keeping the &quot;first NLRB&quot; independent. The NRLB's chairman, 36-year-old <a href="Lloyd_K._Garrison" title="wikilink">Lloyd K. Garrison</a>, had agreed to serve as the chair only to get the board up and running, and he resigned on October 2, 1934, to resume his position as acting dean of the <a href="University_of_Wisconsin_Law_School" title="wikilink">University of Wisconsin Law School</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Garrison suggested as his replacement a long-time friend, <a href="Francis_Biddle" title="wikilink">Francis Biddle</a>, a prominent <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a> attorney.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Biddle was appointed to the post on November 16.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_Labor" title="wikilink">Secretary of Labor</a> <a href="Frances_Perkins" title="wikilink">Frances Perkins</a>, however, had long sought to assert her department's control over the NLRB, but Garrison and Perkins came to an informal agreement which preserved the NLRB's independence.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> With Garrison's departure, however, Perkins sought to abrogate this agreement. She secretly met with President Roosevelt and secured changes to the executive order appointing Biddle to the NLRB which placed the agency completely under her control.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Millis learned of the content of the executive order and alerted Biddle.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Biddle confronted Perkins hours before his swearing-in, and Perkins agreed to hold the order in abeyance until she, Biddle, and the president could meet.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Roosevelt later agreed that his order had been inappropriate, and agreed that while he would not rescind the order he would also not permit it to be enforced (personally guaranteeing the NLRB's independence).<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Millis deeply impressed his colleagues on the NLRB. Garrison called him immensely experienced, with excellent judgment and common sense.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Biddle said Millis educated him about the history of the labor movement, and called him cautious, thoughtful, wise, and cheerful.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Millis, he said, was &quot;&quot;profoundly conscious of the injustices that had been done labor's attempt to organize, although at the same time aware of the dangerous weaknesses in a good deal of labor leadership: not only the racketeering and the feather-bedding, but the lack of imagination, the insistence on improved wages and hours as the sole end, the petty jurisdictional jealousies and squabbles...&quot;<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>Millis played a major role in keeping the NLRB's jurisdiction as well. On June 18, 1934, the National Labor Board asserted jurisdiction over a labor dispute at the <em><a href="San_Francisco_Call" title="wikilink">Call-Bulletin</a></em>, a newspaper in <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a>, <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Although the National Labor Board was disbanded two weeks later, but the &quot;first NLRB&quot; asserted continued jurisdiction over the dispute.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> At a hearing in Washington, D.C., on November 13, 1934, counsel for the newspaper asserted that NIRA gave exclusive jurisdiction over all newspaper industry labor disputes to the Newspaper Industrial Board (NIB).<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> The NIB was a body established by the Code of Fair Competition for the Daily Newspaper Publishing Business, a &quot;fair trade&quot; code established under the authority of NIRA and approved by President Roosevelt.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> If the NLRB bowed to the newspaper's interpretation, it would be essentially giving up all of its authority to the National Recovery Administration (NRA), with which it was already locked in a jurisdictional struggle. Instead, the NLRB decided to challenge the NRA's claim of authority over all labor disputes in industries covered by NIRA codes.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> On December 3, 1934, Millis and the other NLRB members issued a public statement declaring that NIRA granted NRA no exclusive jurisdiction over labor disputes, and pointing out that since the NIB had deadlocked on all major issues before it the NLRB would step in.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> NRA chief counsel <a href="Donald_Richberg" title="wikilink">Donald Richberg</a> angrily supported the NIB and the newspaper industry, and challenged the NLRB's jurisdictional claim.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The dispute between the NRA and NLRB threatened to cause the collapse of the NRA Labor Advisory Board, and the automobile, rubber, steel, and textile industries threatened to withdraw from their respective boards.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> After the NLRB decided in favor of the <em>Call-Bulletin's</em> workers in December 1934, the NRA refused to enforce the decision.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Unfortunately, President Roosevelt issued a letter on January 22, 1935, requesting that the NLRB decline jurisdiction in a small number of NIRA codes and asking the NLRB to submit any recommendations it did make in such disputes confidentially to the president.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> The following day, Millis, Biddle, and Smith agreed to challenge the president on the jurisdictional issue.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Millis and Smith even threatened to resign, causing the collapse of the NLRB, if Roosevelt insisted on enforcing his letter of January 22.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Millis, Biddle, and Smith met with the President a few days later.

<h3 id="changes-instituted-at-the-board">Changes instituted at the Board</h3>
<p>Millis implemented significant administrative changes at the NLRB. His goal was to get the NLRB out of the limelight in wake of Smith Committee investigation.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> He deliberately made the NLRB more dependent on Congress and the executive branch for its survival.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
<p>Millis allied with Leiserson against Edwin S. Smith, and made extensive changes in NLRB administration, doctrine, personnel and operations.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> Smith strongly criticized these changes, but Millis replied that Smith had refused to discuss these changes or participate in Board decisions making them and had thus lost his right to criticize.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> Millis stripped the office of Secretary of all its power and never filled the position, set up an Administrative Division to supervise the 22 regional offices, initiated a study of the Board's administrative procedures, and genuinely delegeated power to the regional offices.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> He appointed Robert Watts as the agency's new chief counsel, removed casehandling and regional office communication from the jurisdiction of the Office of the Secretary, created a Field Division, delegated large amounts of authority to field offices, and generally implemented the recommendations of a 1939 internal staff report (which had been stalled by Chairman Madden because it would have taken authority out of Witt's hands).<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a><a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> He also adopted most of the recommendations William Leiserson had made regarding how the Board made its decisions, which included basing decisions on trial examiner's report, authorizing NLRB review attorneys to review each report, drafting decisions for review ahead of time, authorizing review attorneys to revise the draft befor a final decision was issued, altering the trial examiner's report to emphsize findings of fact and to support points of law, and holding Board conferences when there were differences of opinion over decisions.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> He also eliminated Review Division's decisive role in cases, which had been established under Madden and Witt.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> Madden and Witt had adopted a highly centralized Board structure so that (generally speaking) only the cases most favorable to the Board made it to the courts. The centralized structure meant that only the strongest cases made it to the Board itself, where the Board could apply all its economic and legal powers to crafting the best desicion possible. This strategy had enabled to Board to defend itself very well before the Supreme Court, so that the Court upheld the NLRA when few expected it to do so. But Madden and Witt had held on to the centralized strategy too long, and made political enemies in the process. Millis dismantled Madden's centralized process which had been used to win court litigation, and substituted a decentralized process in which the Board was less a decision-maker and more a provider of services to the regions.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> Many of the changes Millis instituted were designed to mimic requirements placed on other agencies by the <a href="Administrative_Procedure_Act" title="wikilink">Administrative Procedure Act</a>.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
<p>Millis' alliance with Leiserson also overturned a number of the NLRB's more radical precedents and established a more moderate labor policy. Where the Madden Board had issued wide-ranging decisions approving multi-plant locals in <em>Shipowners Association of the Pacific Coast</em>, 7 NLRB 1002 (1938) and <em>Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company</em>, 10 NLRB 1470 (1939) (decisions that favored <a href="industrial_unionism" title="wikilink">industrial unions</a> like the CIO), Millis worked with Leiserson to overturn these precedents in <em>Shipowners Association of the Pacific Coast</em>, 32 NLRB 668 (1941) and <em>Libbey-Owens Ford</em>, 31 NLRB 243 (1942).<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> The Millis-led Board also issued a number of decision that turned the bar on representation petitions during the term of the contract into a tool for ensuring the security of incumbent unions.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> Although the Madden Board had held in <em>A. Sartorious</em>, 10 NLRB 403 (1938), that <a href="strikebreaker" title="wikilink">strikebreakers</a> were not eligible to participate in union organizing elections, the Millis Board voted in <em>In Rudolph Wurlitzer Co.</em>, 32, NLRB 163 (1941) to overturn that precedent.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> The Madden Board had held in <em>Inland Steel</em>, 9 NLRB 783 (1938) that a company was responsible for actions of its foremen, but the Millis Board overturned this decision in <em>Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons, Inc.</em>, 32 NLRB 1056 (1941).<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> The Madden Board had ruled several times that an employer could be held guilty of NLRA violations no matter the circumstances, but in in <em>New York and Porto Rico S.S. Co.</em>, 34 NLRB 1028 (1941), the Millis-led Board said the employer was absolved of guilt if it had been forced to act under union economic pressure.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> These and other critical decisions by the Millis Board were strongly approved of by Secretary of Labor Perkins and President Roosevelt.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
<p>Not all changes at the NLRB deepened Millis' control of the Board. When Edwin S. Smith's term expired in August 1941, Millis wrote to Roosevelt and suggested <a href="William_Hammatt_Davis" title="wikilink">William Hammatt Davis</a> (Deputy Administrator of the NRA), attorney (and later Senator) <a href="Wayne_Morse" title="wikilink">Wayne Morse</a>, Professor <a href="George_W._Taylor_(professor)" title="wikilink">George W. Taylor</a>, and economist <a href="Edwin_E._Witte" title="wikilink">Edwin E. Witte</a> as Smith's replacement.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> Secretary Perkins suggested Gerard D. Reilly, a solicitor in the Department of Labor.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> Reilly won Roosevelt's approval. Reilly, however, was very conservative and adopted a <a href="Legalism_(Western_philosophy)" title="wikilink">legalistic</a> approach to labor law, and Millis and many others at the NRLB considered him a <a href="reactionary" class="uri" title="wikilink">reactionary</a>.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> Reilly believed Millis was too much influenced by Chief Trial Examiner Frank Bloom (a <a href="Left-wing_politics" title="wikilink">left-wing</a> lawyer) and Oscar Smith, head of Field Division.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> Millis thought Reilly's legalism interfered with &quot;realistic&quot; labor relations, and that he was too willing to impose his conservative views on national labor relations policy just as Madden and Smith had imposed their liberal views.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="chairmanship-during-world-war-ii">Chairmanship during World War II</h3>
<p>The United States entered World War II on December 8, 1941, and the war significantly changed the NRLB and Millis' tenure as chairman.</p>
<p>On January 12, 1942, President Roosevelt created the <a href="National_War_Labor_Board" title="wikilink">National War Labor Board</a> (NWLB), whose existence displaced the NLRB as the main focus of federal labor relations for the duration of the war.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> The NWLB was given the authority to &quot;finally determine&quot; any labor dispute which threatened to interrupt war production, and to stabilize union wages and benefits during the war.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> Although Roosevelt instructed the NWLB not to intrude on jurisdiction exercised by the NLRB, the War Labor Board refused to honor this request.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> But Millis was not adept at bureaucratic maneuvering,<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> and did not understand that press attention could help him win battles with the NWLB.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> For the next three years, Millis tried to secure a jurisdictional agreement with NWLB chair George W. Taylor, but these discussions proved fruitless and Millis broke them off in June 1945.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> The NWLB also heavily raided the NLRB for staff, significantly affecting Millis' ability to ensure NLRB operations. From July 1942 to October 1943, the NLRB lost more than 150 staff, including several regional directors, to the War Labor Board.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a></p>
<p>Additional changes came with the passage of the <a href="War_Labor_Disputes_Act" title="wikilink">War Labor Disputes Act</a> on June 25, 1943. Enacted over Roosevelt's veto after 400,000 coal miners, their wages significantly lowered due to high wartime inflation, struck for a $2-a-day wage increase,<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> Whenever a union threatened to strike, the legislation required NLRB (in part) to generate a strike ballot outlining all the collective bargaining proposals and counter-proposals, wait 30 days, and then hold a strike vote.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> The War Labor Disputes Act proved very burdensome. The NLRB processed 2,000 WLDA cases from 1943 to the end of 1945, of which 500 were strike votes.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> The act's strike vote procedures did little to stop strikes, however: 203 of the 232 strike votes taken in 1944 led to strike, and Millis feared unions were using the referendums to whip up pro-strike feelings among their members.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> Millis also believed the law's strike vote process actually permitted more strikes to occur than the NLRB would have allowed under its old procedures.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> There were so many strike vote filings in the six months after the war ended that NLRB actually shut down its long distnace telephone lines, cancelled all out of town travel, suspended all public hearings, and suspended all other business to accommodate the workload.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a></p>
<p>Additional Board personnel changes further moderated the NLRB during Millis' tenure. <a href="John_Mills_Houston" title="wikilink">John Mills Houston</a> was appointed to the Board in 1943 after William S. Leiserson's term expired and Lieserson did not seek reappointment to the agency.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> Millis formed a voting alliance with Houston some time in late 1944.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> Despite this alliance, Millis sometimes was unable to form majorites on the Board. He vigorously dissented in <em>American News Company, Inc.</em>, 55 1302 (1944), a decision in which the Board held that strikers not protected from discharge or refusals of reinstatement if they struck for an illegal reason.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> Millis feared this would resurrect the vague &quot;legality of objective&quot; test which the Board had rejected long ago.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a></p>
<p>By early 1945, Millis was in ill health.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> He resigned from the NLRB on June 7, 1945.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a><a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> His successor was <a href="Paul_M._Herzog" title="wikilink">Paul M. Herzog</a>.</p>
<h2 id="retirement-and-death">Retirement and death</h2>
<p>In the fall of 1945, Millis returned to the University of Chicago. He became senior adviser to the newly-formed Industrial Relations Center, and (with former student Emily Clark Brown) began a major analysis of federal labor policy.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> Their co-authored work, <em>From Wagner Act to Taft-Hartley: A Study of National Labor Policy and Labor Relations</em>, had just been completed when he died.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a></p>
<p>Millis was critical of the Board in his last years. The Madden Board had held in <em>American Can Co.</em>, 13 NLRB 1252 (1939) that a smaller <a href="craft_unionism" title="wikilink">craft union</a> should not be created if there was any history of industrial union bargaining with the employer.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> Although Millis was critical of the <em>American Can</em> decision, he nonetheless rarely permitted it to be violated during his tenure on the Board.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> He took his successor, Paul Herzog, to task for repeatedly violating the <em>American Can</em> doctrine between 1945 and 1947.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> He also criticized the Herzog Board for becoming too dependent on Congress, for delaying decisions for political reasons, and for allowing consultation with interested parties to appear too much like undue influence<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> He also criticized Herzog for being over-cautious and not enforcing the NLRA strongly enough.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a></p>
<p>Millis was a member of a number of associations during his lifetime. He was a longtime member of the <a href="American_Economic_Association" title="wikilink">American Economic Association</a>, serving as its president from 1934 to 1935.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a><a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a><a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a><a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> He was also a member of the Chicago Bibliographic Society,<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> a director of the <a href="National_Bureau_of_Economic_Research" title="wikilink">National Bureau of Economic Research</a>,<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> a founder and director of the <a href="Agricultural_Economics_Foundation" title="wikilink">Agricultural Economics Foundation</a>,<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a> and a member of the <a href="Social_Science_Research_Council" title="wikilink">Social Science Research Council</a> and the <a href="Cosmos_Club" title="wikilink">Cosmos Club</a>.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a><a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a></p>

The strike soon spread to Bethlehem Steel, Inland Steel, Jones and Laughlin Steel Company, and Youngstown Sheet and Tube&lt;U+2014&gt;the so-called &quot;Little Steel&quot; group (because each company was smaller than the giant U.S. Steel). The <a href="Little_Steel_strike" title="wikilink">Little Steel strike</a> became one of the most famous in American history. Violence quickly engulfed many of the strikes, with both side employing violence. On May 30, 1937, members of the Chicago Police Department shot and killed 10 unarmed union demonstrators near the Republic Steel plant in Chicago in what later became known as the <a href="Memorial_Day_massacre_of_1937" title="wikilink">Memorial Day massacre</a>. On June 18, 1937, SWOC filed <a href="unfair_labor_practice" title="wikilink">unfair labor practice</a> charges against Republic Steel for its actions in the Little Steel strike. On April 8, 1938, the NLRB ruled against Republic Steel, ordering the company to reinstate all but 11 strikers on the grounds that the company's &quot;brutal acts of violence&quot; had prompted the union violence. It also ordered Republic Steel to lay off all the replacement workers it had hired.<a href="#fnref120" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
