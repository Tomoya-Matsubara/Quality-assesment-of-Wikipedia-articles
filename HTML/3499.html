<p>The common moth <strong><em>Pyrrharctia isabella</em></strong> is known by different common names at its two main life stages. The adult is the <strong>Isabella tiger moth</strong> and the larva is called the <strong>banded woolly bear</strong>. The larvae of many species of <a href="Arctiidae" title="wikilink">Arctiid</a> moths are called &quot;woolly bears&quot; because of their long, thick, furlike <a href="seta" title="wikilink">setae</a>. This species is black at both ends with a band of coppery red in the middle. The adult moth is dull yellow to orange with a robust, furry thorax and small head. Its wings have sparse black spotting and the proximal segments on its first pair of legs are bright reddish-orange.</p>

It survives winter freezes by producing a <a href="cryoprotectant" class="uri" title="wikilink">cryoprotectant</a> in its tissues. Once the weather warms, the larva devours all the grass and weeds it can, pupates, and becomes an adult, which then lives through the summer. It is the larvae of this species which are the subject of common folklore, which has it that the forthcoming severity of a winter can be predicted by the amount of black on the caterpillar; this is the most familiar woolly bear in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a>. As with many such folk tales, there is little or no truth to the legend; larvae produced in the same clutch of eggs can vary from mostly red to mostly black, even when reared under the same conditions, and this variability invalidates any actual temperature-related trends that may otherwise be evident. In fact, the orange band will grow towards the ends of the body, with the black bands decreasing in size, as the larva matures.</p>
<p>The <a href="setae" class="uri" title="wikilink">setae</a> (bristles) of the woolly bear caterpillar do not inject venom and are not urticant (meaning they don't cause itching or stinging), but they will play dead if picked up or disturbed. Handling them is discouraged, however, as the bristles may cause <a href="dermatitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">dermatitis</a> in people with sensitive skin.</p>

<p>The annual <a href="Woollybear_Festival" title="wikilink">Woollybear Festival</a> occurs each October in <a href="Vermilion,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Vermilion, Ohio</a>. The family event, started in 1973, features a woolly bear costume contest in which kids, even pets, are dressed up as various renditions of the woolly bear caterpillar.</p>
<p>There also is an annual Woolly Worm Festival that occurs in <a href="Beattyville,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Beattyville, Kentucky</a>. It started in 1987, and features many food booths, live music, a &quot;Woolly Worm Race&quot; in which people race the Woolly Bear caterpillar up vertical strings.</p>
<p>There is also an annual Woolly Worm Festival that occurs in Banner Elk, NC. It began in 1977 and celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2007. The festival includes booths with crafts, food, and races. The winning Woolly Worm predicts the winter weather for the following winter.</p>
