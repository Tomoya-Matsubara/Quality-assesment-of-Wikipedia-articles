<p><strong>Carabane</strong>, also known as <strong>Karabane</strong>, is an island and a village located in the extreme south-west of <a href="Senegal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Senegal</a>, in the mouth of the <a href="Casamance_River" title="wikilink">Casamance River</a>. This relatively recent geological formation consists of a <a href="shoal" class="uri" title="wikilink">shoal</a> and <a href="alluvium" class="uri" title="wikilink">alluvium</a> to which soil is added by accumulation in the branches and roots of the <a href="mangrove" class="uri" title="wikilink">mangrove</a> trees which cover most of the island. Along with the rest of <a href="Ziguinchor_Region" title="wikilink">Ziguinchor Region</a>, Carabane has a tropical climate, cycling between a <a href="dry_season" title="wikilink">dry season</a> and a <a href="wet_season" title="wikilink">wet season</a>. The island was once considered an arid location where no useful plants were likely to grow, but it now supports several types of fruit tree, the most common of which are <a href="mango" title="wikilink">mangos</a> and oranges. Although the nearby <a href="Basse_Casamance_National_Park" title="wikilink">Basse Casamance National Park</a> and <a href="Kalissaye_Avifaunal_Reserve" title="wikilink">Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve</a> have been closed for years because of the <a href="Casamance_Conflict" title="wikilink">Casamance Conflict</a>, Carabane has continued to attract ornithologists interested in its wide variety of birds. Various species of fish are plentiful around the island, but there are very few mammals.</p>
<p>The earliest known inhabitants of the island were the <a href="Jola_people" title="wikilink">Jola people</a>, the ethnic group which is still the most populous on the island. The <a href="Portuguese_people" title="wikilink">Portuguese</a> were active in the region from the 16th century onwards; however, they did not linger on &quot;Mosquito Island,&quot; the mosquitoes and <a href="Simulium" title="wikilink">black flies</a> convincing them to establish their trading post in the town of <a href="Ziguinchor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ziguinchor</a> instead in 1645. On January 22, 1836, the island was ceded to France by the village leader of <a href="Kagnout" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kagnout</a> in return for an annual payment of 196 francs. A series of treaties between the French and the leaders of the local peoples ensued; however, the inhabitants of Carabane did not recognize the authority of the treaties imposed upon them, resulting in lootings and abductions among French rice farmers by the <a href="Karoninka_people" title="wikilink">Karoninka people</a>. In 1869, Carabane became autonomous, but it merged with <a href="S&lt;U+00E9&gt;dhiou" class="uri" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+00E9&gt;dhiou</a> in 1886. Since , the population of the island has gradually declined for a variety of reasons including periods of drought, the Casamance Conflict and, more recently, the sinking of the <em><a href="MV_Le_Joola" title="wikilink">Joola</a></em> in 2002. Because the <em>Joola</em> was the primary means of travel to and from Carabane, much of the village's ability to trade and receive tourists has been lost.</p>
<p>Although Carabane was once a regional capital, the village has since become so politically isolated from the rest of the country that it no longer fits into any category of the administrative structure decreed by the Senegalese government. The Jola account for the majority of the island's population and Jola society has no formal hierarchy. The indigenous population was originally <a href="Animism" title="wikilink">animist</a>, but although the sacred groves and <a href="Fetishism" title="wikilink">fetishes</a> survive as cultural icons of <a href="Casamance" class="uri" title="wikilink">Casamance</a>, the <a href="Monotheism" title="wikilink">monotheistic</a> belief systems of <a href="Roman_Catholicism_in_Senegal" title="wikilink">Catholicism</a> and <a href="Islam_in_Senegal" title="wikilink">Islam</a> have become the most widely held in Carabane. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students attend a primary school on the island, but must move at least as far as <a href="Elinkine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elinkine</a> to continue their studies.</p>
<p>The testimonies of explorers and <a href="List_of_colonial_heads_of_French_S&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E9&gt;gal" title="wikilink">colonial administrators</a> demonstrate that Carabane has participated in rice cultivation, fishery, trade, and <a href="palm_wine" title="wikilink">palm wine</a> production for a long time. The rice cycle plays a central economic and religious role in the lives of the population. <a href="Palm_oil" title="wikilink">Palm oil</a> and palm wine are very popular and traditional in the area. The fishery has long been dominated by <a href="artisan_fishing" title="wikilink">artisan fishing</a>, which supplies the daily needs of the island's population; however, broader economic possibilities have been exploited since the early 20th century. Although there have been attempts to cultivate a tourism industry on the island, the inhabitants have been reluctant to participate. Carabane was added to the list of historic sites and monuments of Senegal in 2003.</p>
<h2 id="toponymy">Toponymy</h2>
<p>The <a href="etymology" class="uri" title="wikilink">etymology</a> of Carabane remains unclear. It could be connected to the <a href="Wolof_language" title="wikilink">Wolof</a> word <em>karaban&lt;U+00E9&gt;</em>, which means &quot;who speaks a lot,&quot; or possibly the <a href="Portuguese_language" title="wikilink">Portuguese</a> words <em>casa</em> and <em>Kaban</em>, which mean &quot;house&quot; and &quot;finish,&quot; respectively. According to this hypothesis, the name means the place &quot;where the houses are finished,&quot; a possible allusion to the fact that this village was the first French capital in Basse Casamance.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> According to other sources,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> the name comes from <em>karam akam</em>, which means &quot;the other side of the river.&quot; These uncertainties are augmented by the instability of the spelling: Karabane with an initial K suggests a <a href="Jola_languages" title="wikilink">Jola</a> or Wolof origin, while Carabane with a C would suggest a Latin derivation, most probably through Portuguese or <a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="Image:Carabane-Beach2.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|upright=3.5|center|alt=A shoreline showing several coconut trees and a few small houses|Although most of Carabane is covered in <a href="mangrove" title="wikilink">mangroves</a>, its coconut trees and sandy beaches attract tourists.</a></p>

It is situated 12&lt;U+00B0&gt; 32' N latitude and 16&lt;U+00B0&gt; 43' W longitude and is, by way of <a href="Elinkine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elinkine</a>, nearly  away from <a href="Ziguinchor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ziguinchor</a>, the capital of the <a href="Ziguinchor_Region" title="wikilink">region of the same name</a>, and a little over  from Dakar, the country's capital.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;<em>Il faut s'armer de patience pour rejoindre l'&lt;U+00EE&gt;le de Carabane</em>,&quot; is a common French phrase which means &quot;One must have patience to reach the island of Carabane.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> While this adage continues to hold true, it was even more appropriate in the 19th century when, according to one traveller, a 26-hour boat trip from <a href="Rufisque" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rufisque</a> (near <a href="Dakar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dakar</a>) to Carabane was deemed fairly short, and was credited to a favourable wind.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Basse Casamance is more readily accessible than in the 19th century, although there is no direct link by sea.</p>
<p>Despite the seemingly close proximity to its neighbouring communities,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> a motorized <a href="pirogue" class="uri" title="wikilink">pirogue</a> trip to Carabane from Elinkine, the nearest village, takes about thirty minutes;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> the trip once took an hour and a half by canoe.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Carabane may also be accessed by a two or three hour boat trip from Ziguinchor. Travelling from <a href="Cap_Skirring" title="wikilink">Cap Skirring</a> via <a href="Cachouane" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cachouane</a> is also possible, but as a detailed map of the region would make clear,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> the channels of salt water are not easily navigated. Carabane's landing is located on a small peninsula on the northeastern coast of the island, which means that boats need to sail along a significant portion of the coast before being able to land.</p>
<h3 id="geology">Geology</h3>
<p><img src="Carabane-Bolongs.JPG" title="fig:Saltwater streams cut across the shoal." alt="Saltwater streams cut across the shoal." /> A recent geological formation,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Carabane consists of a <a href="shoal" class="uri" title="wikilink">shoal</a> and <a href="alluvium" class="uri" title="wikilink">alluvium</a>. As pointed out by early French observers, soils in the region are generally composed of sand and clay, differing in mixture and layer according to natural and human factors. However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks. This type of architecture is also common in the villages of <a href="Mlomp" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mlomp</a> and <a href="Seleki" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seleki</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>In this flat and marshy area, the branches and roots of <a href="mangrove" class="uri" title="wikilink">mangrove</a> trees form dams where deposits of oyster shells naturally accumulate along with mud and plant detritus.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> These tangles help retain soil,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> a process which expands the island where the power of <a href="tidal_race" title="wikilink">tidal race</a> would normally have the opposite effect.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Rising just over 2 m (7 ft), the southern portion of the island is partially flooded during the rainy season and totally submerged every few years.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> At low tide, mudflats are exposed so that boats with <a href="keel" title="wikilink">keels</a> are forced to dock a considerable distance from the island. When arriving at Carabane, the <em>Joola</em> had to stop about 500 m (1500 ft) north of the village in 8 to 10 m (25&lt;U+2013&gt;35 ft) of water.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> <img src="Maison_karabane.jpg" title="fig:Because of their lack of clay, the island&#39;s inhabitants build their houses by wrapping straw around wooden frames." alt="Because of their lack of clay, the island&#39;s inhabitants build their houses by wrapping straw around wooden frames." /> The <a href="coastal_erosion" title="wikilink">coastal erosion</a> and salinization affecting the west of Senegal are also a source of concern on the island;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> signs of erosion have been observed in Carabane since 1849. The house of the government representative on the island has burned down twice; each time it was rebuilt, the site of the building had to be moved further and further inland. The island's erosion is evident when one considers that the original location of the house eventually became flooded, even at low tide.<ref></p>

<p>Using wells, freshwater is available at a reasonable depth for irrigation and domestic purposes. Until the installation of a pump in 2006, however, drinking water had to be sent by boat from Elinkine.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="climate">Climate</h3>
<p>The tropical climate of Basse Casamance cycles between a <a href="dry_season" title="wikilink">dry season</a> and a <a href="wet_season" title="wikilink">wet season</a>, which usually starts in June and ends in October.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Because of the proximity to the ocean, the humidity of the air remains above 40% and contributes to the abundance of vegetation. With the <a href="trade_wind" title="wikilink">trade winds</a> from the <a href="Azores_High" title="wikilink">Azores High</a>, the island enjoys a pleasant climate year-round.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In the north to north-east, these winds are cool and always wet.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Their presence is appreciated by <a href="kitesurfing" title="wikilink">kitesurfers</a>. Agricultural activities, including rice cultivation, depend entirely on rainfall. &quot;<em>Wah u&lt;U+014B&gt;ejutumu, emit elaatut</em>&quot; is a <a href="Jola_people" title="wikilink">Jola</a> proverb which means &quot;If a project will not be completed, it will be because the rain did not fall.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The invocation of <a href="fetishism" title="wikilink">fetishes</a> when there is no rain is part of traditional animist rituals. In recent decades, there has been a general decline in rainfall, which threatens rice production, increases soil salinity, and contributes to the degradation of the mangroves. In May and June, air temperature is around . In January and February, the coldest months, it is around . Temperatures of below  are quite rare. In September, the temperature of surface seawater is .<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="flora">Flora</h3>
<p><img src="Carabane-Mangrove.JPG" title="fig:Mangroves are all-pervasive on the island." alt="Mangroves are all-pervasive on the island." /> At one time, the island was considered an arid location,<ref name="Casamance et Mellacor<U+00E9>e&quot;/&gt; where coconuts were the only useful plants likely to flourish and vegetables were difficult to produce.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In what has become a tropical climate, vegetation is more abundant than in the north of the country, especially during the wet season. Anxious to attract the attention of the French colonial administration which he judged insufficiently involved in the development of Casamance, administrator <a href="Emmanuel_Bertrand-Bocand&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Emmanuel Bertrand-Bocand&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> submitted a report which documented in great detail the plant species then present on the island.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Although this report was written in 1849, the information it contains has remained valuable even into the 21st century.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Most of Carabane is covered in mangroves, forming an impassible jungle that can only be crossed in constructed passages. Mangroves are among the few species capable of adapting to the highly saline environment, where the quantity of <a href="Gas_diffusion_in_soil" title="wikilink">oxygen in the soil</a> is low. In recent decades there has been concern that the mangroves are less prevalent.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> There are various reasons for the degradation, including <a href="crustacean" title="wikilink">crustaceans</a> and the unregulated exploitation of wood. Efforts have been made to safeguard the mangroves and to educate children about their importance.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> <img src="Carabane-Pirogue1.JPG" title="fig:Because kapok wood is so easy to work, the trunks of kapok trees are often carved into pirogues." alt="Because kapok wood is so easy to work, the trunks of kapok trees are often carved into pirogues." /> Tourists are not as attracted to the island for its mangroves as for the coconut trees which line its beaches, as featured on many of Carabane's postcards.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> These palm trees are a valued resource on the island.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>While not as plentiful as in other parts of Basse Casamance such as <a href="Mlomp" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mlomp</a>, <a href="kapok" class="uri" title="wikilink">kapok</a> trees are nonetheless present. Their grey wood is very light and easy to work, for which reasons it is used to construct many items, ranging from doors to <a href="Dugout_(boat)" title="wikilink">dugouts</a>. Jola canoes, which range from  in length, are carved by <a href="adze" title="wikilink">adzes</a> entirely out of one tree each, unlike the traditional Senegalese pirogue.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>As for fruit trees, <a href="mango" title="wikilink">mangos</a> and oranges are the most populous. <a href="Opuntia_ficus-indica" title="wikilink">Prickly pears</a>, <a href="Delonix_regia" title="wikilink">flamboyants</a>, and colourful <a href="bougainvillea" title="wikilink">bougainvilleas</a> brighten the scenery of hotels and camps on the island. Various organizations have contributed to the <a href="deforestation" class="uri" title="wikilink">deforestation</a> of the island.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

The French administration treated Baudin as their representative on the island and did not send others because few of the French wanted to live on the island. Being wet and marshy, Carabane had a reputation for its poor sanitation.

The Baudin family used slaves to produce the rice and, despite the declaration of its <a href="Abolitionism" title="wikilink">abolition</a> in the <a href="French_colonial_empire" title="wikilink">French colonial empire</a> in 1848, slavery continued on the island until the early 20th century.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>The colonial administration wanted to expand its influence around the river, particularly because the inhabitants of Gor&lt;U+00E9&gt;e were threatened with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise of the <a href="African_slave_trade" title="wikilink">slave trade</a>, and also because of their competition with <a href="Saint-Louis,_Senegal" title="wikilink">Saint-Louis</a>. On January 9, 1836, Lieutenant Malavois, who was in charge of Gor&lt;U+00E9&gt;e, left for Casamance in search of a site for a trading post. The tip of <a href="Diogue" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diogue</a>, on the north shore, was first considered, but at the refusal of the Jola, it was the opposite bank which was eventually accepted.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

<p>On January 22, 1836, the island was ceded to France by the village leader of <a href="Kagnout" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kagnout</a> at an annual cost of 196 francs.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Still, another treaty made <a href="S&lt;U+00E9&gt;dhiou" class="uri" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+00E9&gt;dhiou</a> the primary trading post of <a href="Casamance" class="uri" title="wikilink">Casamance</a>, and the exploitation of Carabane was left for some time in the hands of the Baudin family, first Pierre then his brother Jean. Each successively took on the title of Resident. With this official but ambiguous title, they were permitted to continue their trading operation so long as they regularly reported to France.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> <img src="Carabane-Quai.jpg" title="fig:The longest pier on the coast of Africae&quot;/&gt;" alt="The longest pier on the coast of Africae&quot;/&gt;" /> When Jean Baudin fell into disgrace due to a serious incident involving an English ship, he was replaced as Resident in October 1849 by <a href="Emmanuel_Bertrand-Bocand&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Emmanuel Bertrand-Bocand&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> This multilingual, enterprising businessman and <a href="Entomology" title="wikilink">entomologist</a> from <a href="Nantes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nantes</a> transformed &quot;his&quot; island, sparking a resurgence of commercial and political activity. In 1852, the population surpassed 1,000 inhabitants. A <a href="cadastre" title="wikilink">cadastral map</a> assigned tracts of  to traders and contractors. Other tracts of  were allotted for housing. Provisional concessions were granted to residents of Saint-Louis and Gor&lt;U+00E9&gt;e. Other than settlers, the island was mainly inhabited by animist Jola famers, whose practices were disconcerting to the settlers. Coexistence was not always easy. Christianity was practiced by the Europeans and some of the residents of Gor&lt;U+00E9&gt;e, although the island did not yet have a church. Missionaries tried but were not permitted to settle on the island.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>The construction of a wharf  long allowed the berthing of larger vessels coming in from Casamance.<ref name="Casamance et Mellacor<U+00E9>e&quot;/&gt; A railed pier was built along the river in order to facilitate the transfer of goods. Carabane exported rice, but also <a href="cotton" class="uri" title="wikilink">cotton</a>, considered to be of poor quality,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> which was <a href="Cotton_gin" title="wikilink">ginned</a> in a factory built by Bertrand-Bocand&lt;U+00E9&gt; in 1840, owned first by <a href="Maurel_&amp;_Prom" title="wikilink">Maurel &amp; Prom</a> and then by the Casamance Company.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The factory also produced <a href="almond" title="wikilink">almonds</a> and <a href="Carapa" title="wikilink">crabwood</a> (<em>Carapa procera</em>).<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Bertrand-Bocand&lt;U+00E9&gt; became involved in local African politics during his time as Resident. When an intertribal conflict led to an armed raid of Carabane, he mediated the conflict. In 1850, the island's economic growth was disturbed because of an extensive livestock <a href="Raid_(military)" title="wikilink">raid</a> which precipitated further incidents the following year. In response to this conflict with the former owners of Carabane, the residents of Kagnout, Bertrand-Bocand&lt;U+00E9&gt; convinced the <a href="List_of_colonial_heads_of_French_S&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E9&gt;gal" title="wikilink">governor of Senegal</a> to send a warship to Carabane to frighten off the raiders. This single ship failed to faze the island's opponants, therefore Bertrand-Bocand&lt;U+00E9&gt; requested a detachment of soldiers and several other ships from the governor. When these reinforcements arrived from Gor&lt;U+00E9&gt;e, the conflict was successfully ended. A treaty was signed on March 25, establishing the sovereignty of France not only in Casamance, but also in Kagnout and <a href="Samatit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samatit</a>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> For his involvement in the conflict, Bertrand-Bocand&lt;U+00E9&gt; was accepted into the <em><a href="L&lt;U+00E9&gt;gion_d&#39;honneur" title="wikilink">L&lt;U+00E9&gt;gion d'honneur</a></em> and was given a <a href="Concession_(territory)" title="wikilink">land consession</a>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Bertrand-Bocand&lt;U+00E9&gt; left the island in 1857 for a leave of absence, but he abandoned his post as Resident in 1860. His tireless activity had a lasting effect on the island.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> <img src="Carabane-Factorerie1.jpg" title="fig:The Casamance Company&#39;s first factory (1893 engraving)" alt="The Casamance Company&#39;s first factory (1893 engraving)" /> <img src="Carabane-Factorerie2.jpg" title="fig:The Casamance Company&#39;s second factory" alt="The Casamance Company&#39;s second factory" /> Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the new French territory did not recognize the authority of the treaties imposed upon them. For this reason, rice farmers in Carabane experienced lootings and abductions by the <a href="Karoninka_people" title="wikilink">Karoninka people</a>. Troops led by <a href="&lt;U+00C9&gt;mile_Pinet-Laprade" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C9&gt;mile Pinet-Laprade</a> attacked the Karoninka villages in March 1860, forcing them to submission. A period of calm ensued. While the <a href="Mandinka_people" title="wikilink">Mandinka</a> Muslims continued, illegally, to practice slavery and trade, non-Muslim villages tended to come together, accepting the Resident of Carabane as the arbitrator of their disagreements.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1869, Carabane became autonomous, but it merged with S&lt;U+00E9&gt;dhiou in 1886. Its garrison of a dozen men was regularly stricken with tropical diseases such as <a href="malaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">malaria</a>. In 1877, 527 people were counted on the island, mostly Jola, but also some <a href="Wolof_people" title="wikilink">Wolofs</a>, Muslims, and a few <a href="Manjack_people" title="wikilink">Manjacks</a> from <a href="Portuguese_Guinea" title="wikilink">Portuguese Guinea</a>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>The first Catholic mission in S&lt;U+00E9&gt;dhiou was founded in 1875 and the first <a href="baptism" title="wikilink">baptisms</a> were celebrated that same year in Carabane. There were 17 people baptised in total, most of whom were residents of the island. The mission in Carabane was founded in 1880. On February 22, Father Kiffer settled on the island, but he served for only two years.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> The staff of the colonial administration was small: the manager of a customs post with four employees, a <a href="Artillery" title="wikilink">gunner</a>, a <a href="corporal" class="uri" title="wikilink">corporal</a>, and six European <a href="tirailleur" title="wikilink">tirailleurs</a>. There were approximately 250 Christians in Carabane, mostly <a href="mulatto" title="wikilink">mulattos</a>. The priest built his house out of <a href="Borassus" title="wikilink">Palmyra Palm</a> trunks. He visited nearby villages and sometimes went to S&lt;U+00E9&gt;dhiou. The founding of the mission in Carabane was followed by others in <a href="Ziguinchor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ziguinchor</a> (1888), <a href="Elinkine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elinkine</a> (1891), and several nearby locations in the 20th century. In 1900, a <a href="Holy_Ghost_Fathers" title="wikilink">Spiritan</a> missionary, Father Wintz,<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> wrote the first <a href="catechism" class="uri" title="wikilink">catechism</a> in the <a href="Jola_language" title="wikilink">Jola language</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>Temporarily transferred to Ziguinchor, the Carabane mission closed in 1888. Missionaries returned in 1890 and, although they immediately expanded the church building, it was still not large enough to accommodate all those who wished to attend. Thanks to subsidies by the bishop, <a href="Magloire-D&lt;U+00E9&gt;sir&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Barthet" title="wikilink">Magloire-D&lt;U+00E9&gt;sir&lt;U+00E9&gt; Barthet</a>, and to donations by the parishioners, a new church was built and inaugurated on the Catholic <a href="feast_day" title="wikilink">feast day</a> of <a href="Saint_Anne" title="wikilink">Saint Anne</a> in 1897. The mission also obtained two adjacent properties, lot #73 on the cadastral map. By the following year, the Christian community had performed 1,100 baptisms, as well as many <a href="catechumen" class="uri" title="wikilink">catechumen</a>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>Competition between the French and the Portuguese began to show itself in the region during this period. Because the Portuguese-operated trading posts in <a href="Cacheu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cacheu</a> and <a href="Farim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Farim</a> asked for higher prices than the French-operated trading posts in Carabane and <a href="Seju" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seju</a>, the Portuguese lost many traders to the French.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> This trend led to the ceding of Ziguinchor to France, which was negotiated in Carabane in April 1888 between Commissioner Oliveira and Captain <a href="Henri_Brosselard-Faidherbe" title="wikilink">Brosselard-Faidherbe</a>.</p>
<p>In 1901, the administrative capital of Casamance was transferred from Carabane to Ziguinchor, a status which was transferred in turn to <a href="Oussouye_Department" title="wikilink">Oussouye</a> two years later. By 1904, Carabane had lost several of its amenities, including its customs services, which were centralized. The island's trading houses were abandoned and the number of Christians dwindled from 1,000 to 300 by 1907.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the <a href="Anti-clericalism" title="wikilink">anti-clerical</a> movement's growth in France at the time, education in Carabane continued to be administered by the Holy Ghost Fathers for the boys and by the <a href="Sisters_of_St._Joseph_of_Cluny" title="wikilink">Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny</a> for the girls. A chapel also continued to be run on the island.</p>
<p>In 1913, just before the outbreak of , Carabane suffered a fire which caused its business to decline. People gradually left the island in search of work in Ziguinchor and even <a href="Dakar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dakar</a>.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> On December 1915, <a href="Marcel_de_Coppet" title="wikilink">Marcel de Coppet</a>, administrator of Ziguinchor, visited the island in order to recruit <a href="Senegalese_Tirailleurs" title="wikilink">tirailleurs</a>. Six inhabitants of the island accepted the position: a Christian, a pagan, and four Muslims.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>In the aftermath of the Great War, the <a href="Roman_Catholicism_in_Senegal" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic Church</a> encountered great difficulties in the region. There was insufficient staffing, the cost of living was rising, and the harsh climate began to wear on the buildings. In 1920, the diocese had, in addition to Carabane, thirteen churches and approximately thirty-five chapels. The thirteen churches were located in Dakar, <a href="Saint-Louis,_Senegal" title="wikilink">Saint-Louis</a>, <a href="Gor&lt;U+00E9&gt;e" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gor&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</a>, <a href="Rufisque" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rufisque</a>, <a href="Thi&lt;U+00E8&gt;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thi&lt;U+00E8&gt;s</a>, <a href="Ngazobil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ngazobil</a>, <a href="Joal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Joal</a>, <a href="Fadiouth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fadiouth</a>, <a href="Foundiougne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Foundiougne</a>, <a href="Kaolack" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kaolack</a>, Ziguinchor, <a href="Bignona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bignona</a> and <a href="Banjul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Banjul</a>. In 1922, the Governor decreed which buildings were authorized to practise Catholicism. While the Carabane church was one of the buildings selected, some members blamed the colonial administration for having facilitated the expansion of <a href="Islam_in_Senegal" title="wikilink">Islam in the country</a>.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>In taking leadership of the <a href="diocese" class="uri" title="wikilink">diocese</a>, Archbishop <a href="Louis_Le_Hunsec" title="wikilink">Le Hunsec</a> noted that the island of Carabane, heavily populated when trading was concentrated there, had lost its influence and now had fewer than 500 inhabitants.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> He considered transferring the mission to <a href="Oussouye_Department" title="wikilink">Oussouye</a>, which became a reality in 1927. Starting in 1937, the mission in Oussouye also performed baptisms and funerals in Carabane.<ref name="Jordi Tom<U+00E0>s i Guilera 2005 305&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>In the same year, a <a href="reform_school" title="wikilink">reform school</a> was created on the island, operating until 1953, when it was replaced by another in <a href="Nianing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nianing</a>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> A report submitted in 1938 by an educational advisor to Marcel de Coppet, Governor General of <a href="French_West_Africa" title="wikilink">French West Africa</a>, detailed the daily life of the prisoners in the school which housed up to 22 boys, mostly convicted for theft but also occasionally for murder.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>

<p>Carabane's population continued to decline gradually after . In 1950, the construction of a seminary was planned in Carabane,<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> but it was transferred to a new building in <a href="Nyassia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nyassia</a> in 1959. The Carabane mission closed its doors during the wet season of 1953, 83 years after its inception. The nuns and their interns moved to Ziguinchor.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="History_of_Senegal#Independence" title="wikilink">Senegal's independence</a> was declared on August 20, 1960, and after the dissolution of the short-lived <a href="Mali_Federation" title="wikilink">Mali Federation</a>, Casamance saw the arrival of officials coming from the north. Although many of them were Wolofs and Muslims, they did not know the Jola country and its traditions. The periods of <a href="drought" class="uri" title="wikilink">drought</a> that ravaged the <a href="Sahel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sahel</a> in the 1970s forced peanut farmers to move to regions where rice was all that grew.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>Discontent began to spread among the people, which sometimes escalated to violence. Casamance has since experienced years of <a href="Casamance_Conflict" title="wikilink">conflict</a> which put local initiatives in jeopardy, such as nature reserves and the first network of villages.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> In 1998, in the middle of the conflict, the French commune of <a href="Bon-Encontre" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bon-Encontre</a> committed to providing Carabane with humanitarian aid, both economically and culturally. Carabane has remained one of the calmest areas of Casamance throughout the conflict. Nonetheless, a few small incidents were reported around April 2000. The rebels may have wanted to take advantage of Carabane's reputation to attract media attention.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="ceasefire" class="uri" title="wikilink">ceasefire</a> of 2004 brought relative peace, but in the meantime, the sinking of the <em><a href="MV_Le_Joola" title="wikilink">Joola</a></em> in 2002 claimed the lives of many inhabitants of Carabane and curtailed much of its ability to engage in trade and accept tourists. Considering the problems brought on by the conflict and the sinking of the <em>Joola</em> along with the threat of <a href="coastal_erosion" title="wikilink">coastal erosion</a> on the island, some fear the worst.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Thus, after years of development and community outreach, Carabane is experiencing difficulties in a number of ways.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

In a country which includes some 13,000 villages, the village is considered, by a 1972 decree, the elementary entity in the administrative body of the nation. Each is administered by a leader, assisted by a council.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> After consultation, the nomination of a leader is established by the prefect and approved by the <a href="List_of_Ministers_of_the_Interior_of_Senegal" title="wikilink">Minister of the Interior</a>.

<p>While this administrative structure was decreed by a government anxious to deal with <a href="Interlocutor_(politics)" title="wikilink">interlocutors</a>, such a restructuring has not taken place in Casamance.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Jola society is devoid of any formal hierarchy.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> It has no leader with genuine permanent authority.

<p>Founded in 1892, the Carabane school was one of the first in the region. It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns belonging to the indigenous congregation of the <a href="Daughters_of_the_Holy_Heart_of_Mary" title="wikilink">Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary</a> began teaching classes for girls.

<p>In 1895, the government established a medical post in Carabane,<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> but it closed the following year.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> In 1898, the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary opened a clinic at the same time as the girls' school.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p>As of 2010, the village has a health facility which is connected to that of Oussouye and Ziguinchor.

<p>From the colonizers' perspective, Carabane's position at the mouth of the river was an undeniable asset. In the 20th and 21st centuries, in terms of trade and tourism issues, this location is more of a disadvantage because it effectively separates the island from the rest of the country.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> The problem was compounded by the <a href="The_Gambia" title="wikilink">Gambian</a> <a href="enclave" class="uri" title="wikilink">enclave</a> and the sinking of the <em>Joola</em>. <a href="Image:GambieBacs2.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|upright=1.3|right|alt=A map of The Gambia indicating the locations in the west and center where travellers may cross in order to arrive at Carabane|In order to arrive at Carabane from most locations in Senegal, travellers must cross <a href="The_Gambia" title="wikilink">The Gambia</a> at either <a href="Banjul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Banjul</a> or <a href="Farafenni" class="uri" title="wikilink">Farafenni</a>.</a> <img src="Carabane-Alley.JPG" title="fig:Although there are no cars on the island to drive on its wide roads, these roads are illuminated by solar lighting." alt="Although there are no cars on the island to drive on its wide roads, these roads are illuminated by solar lighting." /> While a direct route by sea has not been available since the sinking of the <em>Joola</em>, the traveller from Dakar may use various other means of transportation in order to arrive in Basse Casamance. Some <a href="Roads_in_Senegal" title="wikilink">national roads</a> connect to Ziguinchor, down the N1 to <a href="Kaolack" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kaolack</a>. The N4 and N5 roads cross the Gambia (both the country and <a href="Gambia_River" title="wikilink">the river</a>), the former running through <a href="Nioro_du_Rip" title="wikilink">Nioro du Rip</a> to <a href="Farafenni" class="uri" title="wikilink">Farafenni</a>, and the latter crossing the river to <a href="Banjul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Banjul</a>. The two roads merge in Bignona before descending to Ziguinchor. However, traffic is forbidden on both roads between 7 p.m. and 10 a.m., and the routes are subject to frequent accidents and constant <a href="demining" class="uri" title="wikilink">demining</a> operations.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> Alternatively, it is possible to travel by plane to the <a href="Ziguinchor_Airport" title="wikilink">airport in Ziguinchor</a> or <a href="Cap_Skirring_Airport" title="wikilink">Cap Skirring</a>, or to travel by boat to one of these locations. Reaching Carabane from either town is relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>By boat, the distance between Dakar and Carabane is , although Ziguinchor is only  away.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Before the launch of the <em>Joola</em>, other boats, mostly well-worn ones, made the connection: first <em>Cap Skirring</em>, then the <em>Casamance Express</em>, and then <em>Island Karabane</em>.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> In January 1991, a brand new <a href="ferry" class="uri" title="wikilink">ferry</a> went into operation.

On September 26, 2002, 180 extra passengers boarded the already overloaded ship at this stop,<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> and a few hours later, the <em>Joola</em> sank.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> For security reasons, the <em>Joola</em>'s successor, the <em>Wilis</em>, stopped calling at Carabane, to the great displeasure of the inhabitants.

Only the varieties of rice have changed.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<p>The basic tool used is the <em><a href="kayendo" class="uri" title="wikilink">kayendo</a></em>,<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> a kind of wooden spade or shovel ranging from , surrounded by a sharp wrought iron blade and attached to a very long, straight, cylindrical neck. The two parts are connected by strips of torn <a href="Borassus" title="wikilink">Palmyra Palm</a> leaves. The main part is manufactured from a very hard wood measuring  in length. The <em>kayendo</em> is mainly used to plough rice fields, but is also used for other purposes, such as excavation and construction.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> Men perform the clearing and ploughing while the women take care of the sowing, replanting, and weeding as well as the harvesting between October and January.</p>
<p>An even checkerboard plot model dominates the green landscape during the rainy season, which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ only in terms of soil type and location.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> Where <a href="mangrove" title="wikilink">mangroves</a> are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice <a href="paddy_field" title="wikilink">paddy fields</a> between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build <a href="levee" title="wikilink">levees</a>, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and <a href="shrimp" class="uri" title="wikilink">shrimp</a> which subsequently become trapped are harvested at the end of the rainy season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil. <img src="Carabane-Digue.jpg" title="fig:Levees are used to protect the rice paddy fields from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide." alt="Levees are used to protect the rice paddy fields from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide." width="240" /> Although practised in Basse Casamance for centuries, rice cultivation has been threatened since the late 1960s. Productivity has declined because many workers have opted for life in the city, even though they continue to support their community.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> The drought of the 1970s and 1980s further aggravated the situation.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Millet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Millet</a> and vegetables are among some of the other crops grown in Carabane. A few domestic farm animals such as pigs are raised, but they are normally left to roam free.</p>
<h4 id="palm-oil-and-palm-wine">Palm oil and palm wine</h4>
<p>Among the agricultural activities practised during the dry season, which halts work in the rice fields, the most traditional are those related to the exploitation of <a href="African_oil_palm" title="wikilink">African oil palm</a> (<em>Elaeis guineensis</em>), which provides two products which are very popular in the region: <a href="palm_oil" title="wikilink">palm oil</a> and <a href="palm_wine" title="wikilink">palm wine</a>. Palm oil is an essential ingredient in local cuisine. As a carefully preserved condiment, it is combined with plain rice on holidays. The oil comes from the fruit clusters which are picked by men and then deseeded, allowed to dry, crushed in a mortar, and boiled by women.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> <img src="Elaeis_guineensis_MS_4765.JPG" title="fig:Oil palm fruit clusters are integral to the local cuisine." alt="Oil palm fruit clusters are integral to the local cuisine." /> <img src="Mlomp-Mus&lt;U+00E9&gt;eDiola10.JPG" title="fig:Equipment for harvesting palm wine traditionally includes the calabash; however, this natural container has mostly been replaced by synthetic bottles." alt="Equipment for harvesting palm wine traditionally includes the calabash; however, this natural container has mostly been replaced by synthetic bottles." /> Palm wine (called <em>bunuk</em> or <em>bounouk</em> in the Jola language) is an alcoholic drink derived from the natural fermentation of palm sap, so is not strictly a wine, which is produced by the fermentation of <a href="Vitis_vinifera" title="wikilink">grapes</a>. The recent partial <a href="Islamization" class="uri" title="wikilink">Islamization</a> of the region has not challenged its consumption. Fruit clusters are collected exclusively by the men. Supported by a strap, the harvester climbs the tree, cuts the bud, and holds out a funnel which allows the resulting fluid to flow drip by drip into an elongated <a href="calabash" class="uri" title="wikilink">calabash</a> or, more recently, a bottle. The <a href="Ethanol" title="wikilink">alcohol</a> content of palm wine develops throughout the day. The locals consume large quantities on a daily basis, and even more at banquets and ceremonies dedicated to <a href="Fetishism" title="wikilink">fetishes</a>. Palm wine is often traded for rice or sold in the city. Many Jola proverbs attest the popularity of the drink, such as <em>Bunuk abajut birto</em>, which means &quot;With palm wine, one never stands up,&quot; or <em>Ulako, kumusaet j&lt;U+00ED&gt;gabulaju</em>, which means &quot;Sit down, don't spill the palm wine.&quot;<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="aquaculture">Aquaculture</h4>
<p>The island's proximity to the river and the ocean suggests that the area is suited to fishing and related activities, yet the indigenous people, mostly land-dwellers, have long been content to practise <a href="artisan_fishing" title="wikilink">artisan fishing</a>, just to supply their own daily needs. <a href="Pirogue" title="wikilink">Pirogues</a> cut from the trunks of <a href="kapok" class="uri" title="wikilink">kapok</a> trees are most often used, along with traps, nets, baskets, and fences. In the early 20th century, experienced fishermen from other parts of Senegal, along with others from <a href="Mali" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mali</a>, <a href="Guinea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guinea</a>, and <a href="Ghana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ghana</a>,<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> developed deep-sea fishing on the island and introduced new equipment.</p>
<p>The collection of shellfish, especially oysters, is another traditional activity which still takes place in Casamance,<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> which is one of three oyster-producing regions in Senegal, along with <a href="Petite_C&lt;U+00F4&gt;te" title="wikilink">Petite C&lt;U+00F4&gt;te</a> and <a href="Sine-Saloum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sine-Saloum</a>. Oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Oysters are an important component of the family diet. Rich in <a href="dietary_mineral" title="wikilink">dietary minerals</a> and <a href="vitamin_C" title="wikilink">vitamin C</a>, they are the second largest source of animal protein among the Jola people after fish, followed by chicken, and pork. Oysters are readily associated with rice, the <a href="staple_food" title="wikilink">staple food</a>, and in times of shortage, even replace it. Locally, oysters are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and consumed with a spicy sauce. Those destined for sale or preservation, however, are sun-dried or smoked. In some villages, including Carabane, they are kept alive for several weeks before being transported to market.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> Oysters are also a source of income, and Carabane is located in the center of the collection zone, which is one of the reasons why boats formerly called at the island. Oysters were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar, where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by <a href="Hawker_(trade)" title="wikilink">hawkers</a>.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> <img src="Carabane-Oysters.JPG" title="fig:Mangrove oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees." alt="Mangrove oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees." /> <a href="Crustacean" title="wikilink">Crustaceans</a>, such as <a href="Uca_pugilator" title="wikilink">sand fiddler crabs</a> and shrimp, among the mangroves also occupy a significant place in the local economy. While a large number of shrimp species inhabit the <a href="Senegambian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Senegambian</a> area, a single family exists in Casamance: <a href="Penaeidae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Penaeidae</a>.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> <a href="Farfantepenaeus_notialis" title="wikilink">Southern pink shrimp</a> (<em>Farfantepenaeus notialis</em>) are the most commonly collected. They were traditionally caught as part of local artisan fishing by men, women, and children. Shrimp collection in the area experienced significant development in the 1960s, following the establishment of European industrial units. The local fishermen switched to this method, and there was an increased presence of fishermen from other areas. A study in 2005 revealed the extent to which the shrimp population in the region has been depleted, citing multiple causes, including diminishing rainfall, over-salinization of the estuary, and poorly controlled harvesting. Along with the mangrove degradation, the civil unrest, and the inadequate fishery regulation, Casamance has had to deal with the closure in 2003 of a major industrial complex in <a href="Ziguinchor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ziguinchor</a> which treated and exported shrimp and other crustaceans and employed more than 2,000 people.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a></p>
<p>Grouped into cooperatives,<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> women play a leading role in the island's economy. Notably through <a href="microcredit" class="uri" title="wikilink">microcredit</a>, they engage in fishing-related activities, such as smoking fish and processing shrimp, oysters, and shellfish in general. As there is no industrial activity on the island (the closest such activity is in Ziguinchor), the island is experiencing a <a href="rural_exodus" title="wikilink">rural exodus</a> of young people. They return to help their parents in the rice fields and participate in religious ceremonies during the dry season, but they tend to settle off the island permanently.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>

<p>At the same time, national and even international controversy threatened the industry from the beginning.

Several towns in Basse Casamance, including Carabane, were selected to test an integrated <a href="agritourism" class="uri" title="wikilink">agritourism</a> managed by the villagers themselves. In the early 1970s, the agritourism promoter Christian Saglio, a young French sociologist who later became the director of the <a href="Leopold_Sedar_Senghor_French_Institute" title="wikilink">Leopold Sedar Senghor French Institute</a> in <a href="Dakar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dakar</a>, believed in Carabane's potential.

Saglio suggested the restoration of old buildings and <a href="canopy_bed" title="wikilink">canopy beds</a>.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> <img src="Carabane-H&lt;U+00F4&gt;tel.JPG" title="fig:The Catholic mission house built in 1880 has since been turned into a hotel." alt="The Catholic mission house built in 1880 has since been turned into a hotel." /> Despite his fervour, Saglio's negotiations with the local people were unsuccessful. <a href="Niomoune" class="uri" title="wikilink">Niomoune</a> and Carabane were the first two villages to attempt to apply this innovative approach, but both failed. The inhabitants were reluctant to participate, and the young inexperienced promoter had to abandon some of his <a href="Ethnography" title="wikilink">ethnographic</a> theories in favour of being careful to understand the daily realities of villages.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> The project was eventually abandoned, and the <a href="Catholic_missions" title="wikilink">Catholic missions</a> house was transformed by the nuns themselves into a modern, functional building. Despite the failure of Saglio's initiative in Carabane, agritourist camps were set up over the following decade in a dozen other nearby towns.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
<p>While Carabane's tourism sector has suffered because it has not taken part in the network of villages, tourists have avoided travelling to Casamance in general because of the civil unrest. The signing of a <a href="ceasefire" class="uri" title="wikilink">ceasefire</a> in 2004 allowed tourism to resume, but not to the extent it had reached before the conflict.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
<p>Tour operators continue to advertise the island as a lost paradise surrounded by mangroves where travellers' exotic dreams come to life,<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> but this type of discovery tourism is not as popular as traditional beach-related tourism. Thus, visitors from France, Spain, and Italy often combine tours of the <em>cases &lt;U+00E1&gt; <a href="impluvium" class="uri" title="wikilink">impluvium</a></em> in <a href="Enampore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Enampore</a> or <a href="Mlomp" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mlomp</a> with a few days of relaxation in Carabane. The area is also very conducive to the interests of fishing enthusiasts. Along the beach, small stalls offer traditional crafts and clothes at prices lower than those in <a href="Cap_Skirring" title="wikilink">Cap Skirring</a> or <a href="Saly" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saly</a>. Badji Malang, a local painter, potter, sculptor, and poet, has created a camp in the area.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a></p>
<p>Although remaining separate from the local tourism network, Carabane has demonstrated its support for <a href="social_solidarity" title="wikilink">social solidarity</a> and <a href="holism" class="uri" title="wikilink">holism</a> by joining GENSEN (Global Ecovillage Network Senegal), a network of Senegalese <a href="ecovillage" title="wikilink">ecovillages</a>.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>

There is also a French cemetery where Captain Protet was shot with a poisoned arrow and buried standing up in front of the sea, according to his last wishes.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> Some tour guides falsely claim that this is <a href="Auguste_L&lt;U+00E9&gt;opold_Protet" title="wikilink">Auguste L&lt;U+00E9&gt;opold Protet</a>,<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> the founder of the city of Dakar, but it is actually Aristide Protet who died in 1836, more than twenty years before the founding of the city, as evidenced by the plaque on his tomb.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
<p>Near the beach are ruins of buildings, <a href="Pontoon_(boat)" title="wikilink">pontoons</a>, and wells, with a large tree in the center. A huge piece of metal in its midst bears the inscription <em>CEO Forrester &amp; Co. Vauxhall Foundry. 18 Liverpool S3</em>.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></p>
<p>Carabane was added to the list of historic sites and monuments of Senegal in 2003.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> An application for Carabane to become a <a href="World_Heritage_Site" title="wikilink">World Heritage Site</a> was filed with <a href="UNESCO" class="uri" title="wikilink">UNESCO</a> on November 18, 2005.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a></p>
<p>Inspired by Gor&lt;U+00E9&gt;e's example, Carabane is attempting to pay homage to victims of <a href="slavery" class="uri" title="wikilink">slavery</a> by starting a small museum like the <a href="The_Door_of_No_Return" title="wikilink">House of Slaves</a>.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a><a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> Historic research has not established with certainty the role that Carabane played in the <a href="African_slave_trade" title="wikilink">African slave trade</a>.</p>
<p>Like Gor&lt;U+00E9&gt;e and <a href="Saint-Louis,_Senegal" title="wikilink">Saint-Louis</a>, Carabane places great importance on its <a href="cultural_heritage" title="wikilink">cultural heritage</a>. The architectural reminders of this heritage require significant restoration as they have experienced considerable degradation. In 1964, French anthropologist <a href="Louis-Vincent_Thomas" title="wikilink">Louis-Vincent Thomas</a> posed the question of whether Carabane should be preserved,<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> and this question continues to be relevant. The local people suggest that the entire <a href="Diogue" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diogue</a>&lt;U+2013&gt;<a href="Nikine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nikine</a>&lt;U+2013&gt;Carabane area needs saving.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> </p>
