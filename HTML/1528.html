<p>The <strong>Vietnam Meritorious Service Medal</strong> was a military decoration of <a href="South_Vietnam" title="wikilink">South Vietnam</a> that was issued between the years of <a href="1950" class="uri" title="wikilink">1950</a> and <a href="1974" class="uri" title="wikilink">1974</a>. Each of the three Vietnamese military services issued its own version of the Meritorious Service Medal.</p>
<p>The medal was intended to recognize significant military achievement, both in combat and non-combat service, which surpassed the degree required for the <a href="Vietnam_Gallantry_Cross" title="wikilink">Vietnam Gallantry Cross</a> but did not warrant receipt of the higher decorations such as the <a href="National_Order_of_Vietnam" title="wikilink">National Order of Vietnam</a> or the <a href="Vietnam_Military_Merit_Medal" title="wikilink">Vietnam Military Merit Medal</a>.</p>
<p>The Vietnam Meritorious Service Medal was occasionally bestowed to foreign militaries, with several <a href="United_States_military" title="wikilink">United States military</a> members receiving the decoration during the years of the <a href="Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">Vietnam War</a>. The decoration became obsolete with the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, and is today only available for purchase through private dealers of military insignia.</p>
