The Azeris are typically <a href="Muslim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muslim</a> and have a mixed cultural heritage of <a href="Turkic_peoples" title="wikilink">Turkic</a>, <a href="Iranian_peoples" title="wikilink">Iranian</a>, and <a href="Peoples_of_the_Caucasus" title="wikilink">Caucasian</a> elements.</p>
<p>Despite living on both sides of an international border, the Azeris form a single ethnic group.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> However, northerners and southerners differ due to nearly two centuries of separate social evolution in <a href="Russia" title="wikilink">Russian</a>/<a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet</a>-influenced Azerbaijan and <a href="Azarbaijan_(Iran)" title="wikilink">Iranian Azarbaijan</a>. The <a href="Azerbaijani_language" title="wikilink">Azerbaijani language</a> unifies Azeris and is mutually intelligible with <a href="Turkmen_language" title="wikilink">Turkmen</a>, <a href="Qashqai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qashqai</a> and <a href="Turkish_language" title="wikilink">Turkish</a> (including the dialects spoken by the <a href="Iraqi_Turkmen" title="wikilink">Iraqi Turkmen</a>). All of these languages are traced to the Turkic <a href="Oghuz_Turks" title="wikilink">Oghuz</a>, who moved into the Caucasus from <a href="Central_Asia" title="wikilink">Central Asia</a> in the 11th century. Following the <a href="Russo-Persian_Wars" title="wikilink">Russian-Persian Wars</a> of the 18th and 19th centuries, <a href="Qajar_dynasty" title="wikilink">Persian</a> territories in the Caucasus were ceded to the <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russian Empire</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> This included parts of the current Republic of Azerbaijan. The treaties of <a href="Treaty_of_Gulistan" title="wikilink">Gulistan</a> in 1813 and <a href="Treaty_of_Turkmenchay" title="wikilink">Turkmenchay</a> in 1828 finalized the border between Russia and <a href="Persian_Empire#Persia_and_Far_West_Eurasia_(1722&lt;U+2013&gt;1914)" title="wikilink">Persia</a> (today known as <a href="Iran" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iran</a>).</p>
<p>As a result of this separate existence, the Azeris are mainly secular in <a href="Republic_of_Azerbaijan" title="wikilink">Azerbaijan</a> and religious Muslims in <a href="Iranian_Azerbaijan" title="wikilink">Iran</a>. Since <a href="Azerbaijan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azerbaijan</a>'s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, there has been renewed interest in religion and cross-border ethnic ties <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Azerbaijan is believed to be named after <em><a href="Atropates" class="uri" title="wikilink">Atropates</a></em>, a <a href="Medes" title="wikilink">Median</a> <a href="satrap" class="uri" title="wikilink">satrap</a> (governor) who ruled in <em><a href="Atropatene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Atropatene</a></em> (modern <a href="Azarbaijan_(Iran)" title="wikilink">Iranian Azarbaijan</a>).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Atropates is derived from <a href="Old_Persian" title="wikilink">Old Persian</a> roots meaning &quot;protected by fire.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <a href="Azerbaijan_(disambiguation)" title="wikilink">Azerbaijan</a> has seen a host of inhabitants and invaders, including <a href="Caucasian_Albania" title="wikilink">Caucasians</a>, <a href="Medes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Medes</a>, <a href="Scythia" title="wikilink">Scythians</a>, <a href="Persian_Empire" title="wikilink">Persians</a>, <a href="Armenians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Armenians</a>, <a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">Greeks</a>, <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Romans</a>, <a href="Khazars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khazars</a>, <a href="Caliph" title="wikilink">Arabs</a>, <a href="Oghuz_Turks" title="wikilink">Oghuz</a>, <a href="Seljuk_Turks" title="wikilink">Seljuks</a>, <a href="Mongol_Empire" title="wikilink">Mongols</a>, and <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russians</a>.</p>
<p>In the 11th century A.D. with Seljukid conquests, <a href="Oghuz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oghuz</a> <a href="Turkic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkic</a> tribes started moving across the Iranian plateau into the Caucasus and Anatolia. The influx of the Oghuz and other Turkmen tribes was further accentuated by the Mongol invasions,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>. Here they divided into Ottomans, who were Sunni and settled, and Turkmens or Turcomans, who were nomads and in part Shiite (or rather, Alevi). The latter were to keep the name &quot;Turkmen&quot; or &quot;Turcoman&quot; for a long time: from 13th century onwards they gradually Turkified the Iranian-speaking populations of Azerbaijan, thus creating a new identity based on Shiism and the use of Turkic. These are the people today known as Azeris<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Caucasian_Albania" title="wikilink">Caucasian Albanians</a> are believed to be the earliest inhabitants of the region where modern day Republic of Azerbaijan is located.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Early invaders included the <a href="Scythia" title="wikilink">Scythians</a> in the ninth century BC.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Following the Scythians, the Medes came to dominate the area to the south of the <a href="Aras_River" title="wikilink">Aras</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The Medes forged a vast empire between 900-700 BC, which was integrated into the <a href="Achaemenids" class="uri" title="wikilink">Achaemenids</a> Empire around 550 BC. During this period, <a href="Zoroastrianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zoroastrianism</a> spread in the Caucasus and Atropatene. The Achaemenids in turn were defeated by <a href="Alexander_the_Great" title="wikilink">Alexander the Great</a> in 330 BC, but the Median satrap Atropates was allowed to remain in power. Following the decline of the <a href="Seleucid" title="wikilink">Seleucids</a> in Persia in 247 BC, an <a href="Kingdom_of_Armenia" title="wikilink">Armenian Kingdom</a> exercised control over parts of Caucasian Albania between 190 BC to 387 AD.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Caucasian Albanians established a kingdom in the first century BC and largely remained independent until the <a href="Sassanid_Empire" title="wikilink">Sassanids</a> made the kingdom a <a href="vassal_state" title="wikilink">vassal state</a> in 252 AD.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Caucasian Albania's ruler, King Urnayr, officially adopted <a href="Christianity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christianity</a> as the state religion in the fourth century AD, and Albania would remain a Christian state until the 8th century.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Sassanid control ended with their defeat by Muslim <a href="Abbasid" title="wikilink">Arabs</a> in 642 AD.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>Muslim Arabs defeated the Sassanids and <a href="Byzantine_Empire" title="wikilink">Byzantines</a> as they marched into the Caucasus region. The Arabs made Caucasian Albania a vassal state after the Christian resistance, led by Prince <a href="Javanshir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Javanshir</a>, surrendered in 667.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Between the ninth and tenth centuries, Arab authors began to refer to the region between the <a href="Kura" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kura</a> and Aras rivers as <em><a href="Arran_(Azerbaijan)" title="wikilink">Arran</a></em>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> During this time, Arabs from <a href="Basra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Basra</a> and <a href="Kufa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kufa</a> came to Azerbaijan and seized lands that indigenous peoples had abandoned; the Arabs became a land-owning elite.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Conversion to Islam was slow as local resistance persisted for centuries and resentment grew as small groups of Arabs began migrating to cities such as <a href="Tabriz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tabriz</a> and <a href="Maraghah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maraghah</a>. This influx sparked a major rebellion in <a href="Azarbaijan_(Iran)" title="wikilink">Iranian Azarbaijan</a> from 816&lt;U+2013&gt;837, led by a local <a href="Zoroastrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zoroastrian</a> commoner named <a href="Babak_Khorramdin" title="wikilink">B&lt;U+0101&gt;bak</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> However, despite pockets of continued resistance, the majority of the inhabitants of Azerbaijan converted to Islam.

<p>In the middle of the eleventh century, the <a href="Seljuk_Turks" title="wikilink">Seljuq</a> dynasty overthrew Arab rule and established an empire that encompassed most of <a href="Southwest_Asia" title="wikilink">Southwest Asia</a>. The Seljuk period marked the influx of <a href="Oghuz_Turks" title="wikilink">Oghuz</a> nomads into the region and, thus, the beginning of the <a href="cultural_assimilation" title="wikilink">turkification</a> of Azerbaijan as the West Oghuz Turkic language supplanted earlier Caucasian and Iranian ones.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>However, Iranian cultural influence survived extensively, as evidenced by the works of then contemporary writers such as <a href="Persian_language" title="wikilink">Persian</a> poet <a href="Nezami" title="wikilink">Nez&lt;U+0101&gt;m&lt;U+012B&gt; Ganjav&lt;U+012B&gt;</a>.

<p><img src="Urmiyye_market.jpg" title="fig:Early twentieth century fruit market in Urmia, Persia." alt="Early twentieth century fruit market in Urmia, Persia." width="300" /> The <a href="Safavids" class="uri" title="wikilink">Safavids</a>, who rose from Iranian Azerbaijan and lasted until 1722, established the modern Iranian state.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Noted for achievements in state building, architecture, and the sciences, the Safavid state crumbled due to internal decay and external pressures from the Russians and <a href="Hotaki" title="wikilink">Afghans</a>. The Safavids encouraged and spread Shi'a Islam which is an important part of the national identity of Iranian Azerbaijani people as well as many Azerbaijanis north of the Aras. The Safavids encouraged the arts and culture and Shah <a href="Abbas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Abbas</a> the Great created an intellectual atmosphere which according to some scholars was a new <em>Golden Age of Persia</em>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He reformed the government and the military, and responded to the needs of the common people.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

The <a href="Russo-Persian_Wars" title="wikilink">Russo-Persian Wars</a> began in the eighteenth century and ended in the early nineteenth century with the <a href="Treaty_of_Gulistan" title="wikilink">Gulistan Treaty</a> of 1813 and the <a href="Treaty_of_Turkmenchay" title="wikilink">Turkmenchay Treaty</a> in 1828, which officially gave the Caucasian portion of Qajar Iran to the Russian Empire.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Iranian Azerbaijan's role in the Iranian constitutional revolution cannot be underestimated. The greatest figures of the democracy seeking revolution <a href="Sattar_Khan" title="wikilink">Sattar Khan</a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> and <a href="Bagher_Khan" title="wikilink">Bagher Khan</a> were both from Iranian Azerbaijan. The Constitutional Revolution of 1906&lt;U+2013&gt;11 shook the Qajar dynasty, whose kings had virtually sold the country to the tobacco and oil interests of the British Empire and had lost territory to the Russian empire. A parliament (Majlis) came into existence by the efforts of the constitutionalists. It was accompanied in some regions by a peasant revolt against tax collectors and landlords, the only indigenous mainstay of the monarchy. Pro-democracy newspapers appeared, and Iranian intellectuals began to relish the modernist breezes blowing from Paris and Petrograd. The Qajar Shah and his British advisers crushed the Constitutional Revolution, but the demise of the dynasty could not be long postponed. The last Shah of the Qajar dynasty was soon removed by a military coup led by <a href="Reza_Khan" title="wikilink">Reza Khan</a>, an officer of an old Cossack regiment, which had been created by Czarist Russia and officered by Russians to protect the Qajar ruler and Russian interests. In the quest of imposing national homogeneity on the country where half of the population consisted of ethnic minorities, Reza Shah issued in quick succession bans on the use of Azerbaijani language on the premises of schools, in theatrical performances, religious ceremonies, and, finally, in the publication of books.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>With the dethronement of Reza Shah in September 1941, Russian troops captured Tabriz and northwestern Persia for military and strategic reasons. <a href="Azerbaijan_People&#39;s_Government" title="wikilink">Azerbaijan People's Government</a>, a client state set up by the order of Stalin himself, under leadership of <a href="Sayyid_Jafar_Pishevari" title="wikilink">Sayyid Jafar Pishevari</a> was proclaimed in Tabriz<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> However, under pressure by the Western countries, the Soviet army was soon withdrawn, and the Iranian government regained control over Iranian Azerbaijan by the end of 1946.</p>
<p>According to Professor. Gary R. Hess: </p>
<p>While the Azeris in Iran largely integrated into modern Iranian society, the Azeris in what is today called the <a href="Republic_of_Azerbaijan" title="wikilink">Republic of Azerbaijan</a> lived through the transition from the Russian Empire to brief <a href="Azerbaijan_Democratic_Republic" title="wikilink">independence</a> from 1918&lt;U+2013&gt;1920 and then incorporation into the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> despite pleas by <a href="Woodrow_Wilson" title="wikilink">Woodrow Wilson</a> for their independence at the <a href="Treaty_of_Versailles" title="wikilink">Treaty of Versailles</a> conference.

<p>In many references, Azerbaijanis are designated as a <a href="Turkic_peoples" title="wikilink">Turkic people</a>, due to their <a href="Turkic_languages" title="wikilink">Turkic language</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> However, modern-day Azerbaijanis are believed to be primarily the descendants of the <a href="Caucasian_Albania" title="wikilink">Caucasian</a> and <a href="Iranian_peoples" title="wikilink">Iranic</a> peoples who lived in the areas of the Caucasus and northern Iran, respectively, prior to <a href="Turkification" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkification</a>. Various historians including <a href="Vladimir_Minorsky" title="wikilink">Vladimir Minorsky</a> explain how largely Iranian and Caucasian populations became Turkish-speaking:</p>

<p>Thus, centuries of Turkic migration and turkification of the region helped to formulate the modern Azerbaijani ethnic group.</p>

By the <a href="Safavid_dynasty" title="wikilink">Safavid</a> period, the <em>Turkification</em> of Azerbaijan continued with the influence of the <a href="Kizilbash" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kizilbash</a>. The very name Azerbaijan is derived from the pre-Turkic name of the province, Azarbayjan or Adarbayjan, and illustrates a gradual language shift that took place as local place names survived Turkification, albeit in altered form.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Most academics view this migration as the most likely source of a Turkic background, but one that most likely involved the <em>linguistic</em> Turkification of predominantly non-Turkic-speaking indigenous peoples and assimilation of small bands of Turkic tribes.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

In addition to this, the epic of Koroglu is important in Azeri cultre, and some cultural items such as Alpamysh and mythology of the wolf <a href="Ashina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ashina</a> may also have something in common with Azerbaijan's culture today . The musical tradition of <a href="Ashik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ashik</a>/Ozan/Bakshy is popular in Azerbaijan as is the folk music including T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk&lt;U+00FC&gt; style mirroring Turkish folk music.</p>

<p>The Caucasian origin mostly applies to the Azeris of the Caucasus, most of whom are now inhabitants of the Republic of Azerbaijan. There is evidence that, despite repeated invasions and migrations, aboriginal <a href="Caucasian_Albania" title="wikilink">Caucasians</a> may have been culturally assimilated, first by <a href="Ancient_Iranian_peoples" title="wikilink">Iranians</a> and later by the Oghuz.

Modern Ashiqs play the <a href="saz" class="uri" title="wikilink">saz</a> (<a href="lute" class="uri" title="wikilink">lute</a>) and sing <em>dastans</em> (historical <a href="ballad" title="wikilink">ballads</a>).<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> Other musical instruments include the <a href="Tar_(lute)" title="wikilink">tar</a> (another type of lute), <a href="duduk" class="uri" title="wikilink">duduk</a> (a wind instrument), <a href="Kamancha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kamancha</a> (fiddle), and the <a href="dhol" class="uri" title="wikilink">dhol</a> (drums). Azeri classical music, called <em><a href="mugham" class="uri" title="wikilink">mugham</a></em>, is often an emotional singing performance. Composers <a href="Uzeyir_Hajibeyov" title="wikilink">Uzeyir Hajibeyov</a>, <a href="Gara_Garayev" title="wikilink">Gara Garayev</a> and <a href="Fikret_Amirov" title="wikilink">Fikret Amirov</a> created a hybrid style that combines Western <a href="European_classical_music" title="wikilink">classical music</a> with mugham. Other Azeris, notably <a href="Vagif_Mustafa_Zadeh" title="wikilink">Vagif Mustafa Zadeh</a> and <a href="Aziza_Mustafa_Zadeh" title="wikilink">Aziza Mustafa Zadeh</a>, mixed <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a> with mugham. Some Azeri musicians have received international acclaim, including <a href="Rashid_Behbudov" title="wikilink">Rashid Behbudov</a> (who could sing in over eight languages) and <a href="Muslim_Magomayev_(musician)" title="wikilink">Muslim Magomayev</a> (a pop star from the Soviet era).</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Iran, Azeri music has taken a different course. According to Iranian Azeri singer <a href="Hossein_Alizadeh" title="wikilink">Hossein Alizadeh</a>, &quot;Historically in Iran, music faced strong opposition from the religious establishment, forcing it to go underground.&quot;<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> As a result, most Iranian Azeri music is performed outside of Iran amongst exile communities.</p>
<p>Azeri film and television is largely broadcast in Azerbaijan with limited outlets in Iran. Some Azeris have been prolific film-makers, such as <a href="Rustam_Ibragimbekov" title="wikilink">Rustam Ibragimbekov</a>, who wrote <em><a href="Burnt_by_the_Sun" title="wikilink">Burnt by the Sun</a></em>, winner of the Grand Prize at the <a href="Cannes_Film_Festival" title="wikilink">Cannes Film Festival</a> and an <a href="Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">Academy Award</a> for <a href="Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film" title="wikilink">Best Foreign Language Film</a> in 1994. Many Iranian Azeris have been prominent in the <a href="Cinema_of_Iran" title="wikilink">cinematic tradition of Iran</a>, which has received critical praise since the 1980s.</p>

<p>Sports have historically been an important part of Azeri life. Numerous competitions were conducted on horseback and praised by poets and writers such as Gatran Tabrizi and <a href="Nezami" title="wikilink">Nezami Ganjavi</a>.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> Other ancient sports include wrestling, javelin throwing and ox-wrestling.</p>
<p>The Soviet legacy has in modern times propelled some Azeris to become accomplished athletes at the Olympic level.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> The Azeri government supports the country's athletic legacy and encourages Azeri youth to take part. <a href="Football_(soccer)" title="wikilink">Football</a> is very popular in both Azerbaijan and <a href="Azarbaijan_(Iran)" title="wikilink">Iranian Azarbaijan</a>. There are many prominent Azeri soccer players such as <a href="Ali_Daei" title="wikilink">Ali Daei</a>, the world's <a href="List_of_football_(soccer)_players_with_30_or_more_international_goals" title="wikilink">all-time leading goal scorer</a> in international matches and the former captain of the <a href="Team_Melli" title="wikilink">Iran national soccer team</a>.

<p><a href="Chess" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chess</a> is another popular pastime in Azerbaijan. The country has produced many notable players, such as <a href="Teimour_Radjabov" title="wikilink">Teimour Radjabov</a> and <a href="Shakhriyar_Mamedyarov" title="wikilink">Shakhriyar Mamedyarov</a>, both highly ranked internationally.</p>
<h2 id="institutions">Institutions</h2>
<p><img src="SV100098.jpg" title="fig:Statue of Women Suffrage in Azerbaijan." alt="Statue of Women Suffrage in Azerbaijan." width="200" /> Azerbaijan and Iranian Azerbaijan have developed distinct institutions as a result of divergent socio-political evolution. Azerbaijan began the twentieth century with institutions based upon those of Russia and the Soviet Union, with strict state control over most aspects of society. Since, they have moved towards the adoption of Western social models as of the late twentieth century. Since independence, relaxed state controls have allowed local <a href="civil_society" title="wikilink">civil society</a> to develop. In contrast, in Iranian Azerbaijan Islamic theocratic institutions dominate nearly all aspects of society, with most political power in the hands of the <a href="Supreme_Leader_of_Iran" title="wikilink">Supreme Leader of Iran</a> and the <a href="Council_of_Guardians" title="wikilink">Council of Guardians</a>. Yet both societies are in a state of change. In Azerbaijan there is a secular democratic system that is mired in political corruption and charges of election fraud. Azerbaijan's civil society is a work in progress: </p>
<p>Despite these problems Azerbaijan has an active political opposition that seeks more expansive democratic reforms.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> Azeris in Iran remain intertwined with the Islamic republic's <a href="theocracy" title="wikilink">theocratic</a> regime and lack any significant civil society of a secular nature that can pose a major challenge. There are signs of civil unrest due to the policies of the Iranian government in Iranian Azarbaijan and increased interaction with fellow Azeris in Azerbaijan and satellite broadcasts from <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a> have revived Azeri nationalism.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="women">Women</h2>
<p><img src="Az_girl_karabakh.jpg" title="fig:Late nineteenth to early twentieth-century Azeri girl from Shusha." alt="Late nineteenth to early twentieth-century Azeri girl from Shusha." width="200" />   Azeri females have historically struggled against a legacy of male domination but have made great strides since the twentieth century. In Azerbaijan, women were granted the right to vote in 1919.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> Women have attained Western-style equality in major cities such as <a href="Baku" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baku</a>, although in rural areas more traditional views remain.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a><a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> Some problems that are especially prevalent include violence against women, especially in rural areas. Crimes such as rape are severely punished in Azerbaijan, but rarely reported, not unlike other parts of the former Soviet Union.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> Azeri women were forced to &quot;give up the veil,&quot;<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> placing Azerbaijan in sharp contrast with Iranian Azarbajan. Women are underrepresented in elective office but have attained high positions in parliament. An Azeri woman is the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Azerbaijan, and two others are Justices of the Constitutional Court. As of 6 November 2005, women constituted 12% of all MPs (fifteen seats in total) in the <a href="National_Assembly_of_Azerbaijan" title="wikilink">National Assembly of Azerbaijan</a>.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> The Republic of Azerbaijan is also one of the few Muslim countries where <a href="abortion" class="uri" title="wikilink">abortion</a> is available on demand.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<p>In Iran, the continued unequal treatment of women has been met with increasingly vocal protests, including that of <a href="Shirin_Ebadi" title="wikilink">Shirin Ebadi</a>, who won the <a href="Nobel_Peace_Prize" title="wikilink">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 2003 for her strong advocacy for women's rights. A groundswell of grassroots movements have emerged seeking gender equality since the 1980s.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a><a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> Regular protests take place in defiance of government bans and are often dispersed through violence, as in June 2006 when &quot;[t]housands of women and male supporters came together on June 12 in Haft Tir Square in Tehran&quot; and were dispersed through &quot;brutal suppression&quot;.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> Past Iranian leaders, such as <a href="Mohammad_Khatami" title="wikilink">Mohammad Khatami</a>, promised women greater rights, but the government has opposed changes that they interpret as contrary to Islamic doctrine. As of 2004, nine Azeri women have been elected to parliament (<a href="Majlis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Majlis</a>) and while most are committed to social change, some represent conservative positions regarding gender issues.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> The social fate of Azeri women largely mirrors that of other women in Iran.</p>
