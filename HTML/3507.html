<p>In <a href="developmental_economics" title="wikilink">developmental economics</a>, the <strong>Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle</strong> (also called the <strong>Growth-Inequality-Poverty Triangle</strong> or <strong>GIP Triangle</strong>) refers to the idea that a country's change in poverty can be fully determined by its change in income growth and income inequality. According to the model, a development strategy must then also be based on income growth and income inequality. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle model was created by <a href="Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois_Bourguignon" title="wikilink">Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Bourguignon</a>, the former <a href="Chief_Economist" title="wikilink">Chief Economist</a> (2003-2007) of the <a href="World_Bank" title="wikilink">World Bank</a>.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle was originally introduced by Bourguignon in a paper presented at the Conference on Poverty, Inequality and Growth in Paris on November 13, 2003. A modified version of the paper was presented at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations in New Delhi on February 4, 2004. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Economists working for international organizations like the World Bank use the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle to create poverty reduction strategies that include both steps to reduce inequality and stimulate growth. Economists have used the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle to study poverty in both <a href="developing_countries" title="wikilink">developing countries</a> and <a href="developed_countries" title="wikilink">developed countries</a>, including China, Egypt, India, Mexico, and Nigeria.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2013, a study of the 138 countries over the period 2005 to 2010 found that the basic ideas of Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle hold and that both growth and inequality impact absolute poverty as Bourguignon described.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle can be drawn as a triangle with arrows pointing out of each corner. At the top of the triangle is &quot;absolute poverty.&quot; This refers to the percent of the population below the income <a href="poverty_line" title="wikilink">poverty line</a>. At the bottom left of the triangle is &quot;inequality&quot; or &quot;distribution.&quot; This refers to differences in income across a population. At the bottom right of the triangle is &quot;growth.&quot; This refers to the change in income for a population (for example, a change in <a href="GDP" class="uri" title="wikilink">GDP</a>). <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The arrows pointing out of &quot;absolute poverty,&quot; &quot;growth,&quot; and &quot;inequality&quot; in the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle represent cause and effect. In the model, inequality and growth affect each other and both of them affect absolute poverty. <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Bourguignon defines the change in poverty as a function of growth, distribution, and changes in distribution: &lt;U+0394&gt; poverty &lt;U+2261&gt; F(growth, distribution, &lt;U+0394&gt; distribution). This equation assumes small changes in poverty.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Bourguignon uses per capita income (<a href="GDP" class="uri" title="wikilink">GDP</a> per capita) as the measure of growth and the <a href="Gini_Index" title="wikilink">Gini Index</a> as the measure of inequality in his model. <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="significance">Significance</h2>
<p>The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle model differs from previous models of poverty in that it looks at the the interactions between growth and inequality, rather than considering the two separately. On the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle, the bottom points of the triangle are boxed together under the heading of &quot;development strategy,&quot; because Bourguignon believed the mix of policies to reduce poverty should depend on that relationship between growth and inequality. <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle model implies that reducing poverty requires a combination of country-wide policies focused on growth and country-wide policies focused on reducing inequality. Development strategies that focus on only one of these miss opportunities to reduce absolute poverty. The model describes that a change in inequality affects absolute poverty in two ways. First, a change in relative poverty affects absolute poverty by immediately changing the number of people below the poverty line. Second, a change in relative poverty changes the <a href="growth_elasticity_of_poverty" title="wikilink">growth elasticity of poverty</a>. A redistribution of income means more poverty reduction for a given amount of growth. The consequence of this is that policies that focus only on growth without considering distribution limit poverty reduction in two ways.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Economists theorize that for this reason sub-Saharan Africa and other less developed countries will not be able to meet poverty goals like the <a href="Millennium_Development_Goals" title="wikilink">Millennium Development Goals</a> through growth alone. <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="controversy">Controversy</h2>
<p>Critics argue that the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle looks at aggregate concepts in a way that ignores the processes behind those concepts. Critics say terms like &quot;poverty,&quot; &quot;inequality,&quot; and &quot;growth&quot; are too broad. Instead, critics suggest that poverty should be traced back to individual behavior. <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Developmental economists <a href="Abhijit_Banerjee" title="wikilink">Abhijit Banerjee</a> and <a href="Esther_Duflo" title="wikilink">Esther Duflo</a> argue that cross-country data cannot be used to give any meaningful insight on topics like poverty and inequality. <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Critics also argue that the simplified nature of the model means that it misses factors that affect absolute poverty. Poverty itself can be considered a barrier for economic growth, meaning that the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle would need to consider the effect of poverty on growth.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Other economists argue that the triangle should include financial instability, crises, the business cycle, and their effects on poverty. Finally, many economists believe that there is a strong link between education, literacy rates, and poverty, and that the focus on decreasing poverty should lie in targeting these areas in addition to inequality and growth. <a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
