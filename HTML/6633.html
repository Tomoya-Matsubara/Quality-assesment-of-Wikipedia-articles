<p><strong>Leonard Hyman Tose</strong> (<a href="March_6" title="wikilink">March 6</a>, <a href="1915" class="uri" title="wikilink">1915</a> - <a href="April_15" title="wikilink">April 15</a>, <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>) Born in <a href="Bridgeport,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Bridgeport, Pennsylvania</a>, made a fortune in the <a href="trucking" class="uri" title="wikilink">trucking</a> industry and was owner of the <a href="Philadelphia_Eagles" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Eagles</a>. He was known for his lavish lifestyle and eventually lost his fortune because of a <a href="gambling_addiction" title="wikilink">gambling addiction</a> and <a href="alcoholism" class="uri" title="wikilink">alcoholism</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-years">Early Years</h2>
<p>His father, who came to the United States from Russia, settled outside <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a> and was a peddler with a pack on his back. He eventually owned 10 trucks, the beginning of the family business. Eventually, Tose Inc. owned more than 700 trucks and grossed $20 million a year.</p>
<h2 id="philadelphia-eagles-owner">Philadelphia Eagles Owner</h2>
<p>In 1969 Tose bought the <a href="Philadelphia_Eagles" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Eagles</a> from <a href="Jerry_Wolman" title="wikilink">Jerry Wolman</a> for $16,155,000<a href="http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/pdf/Y_B_YHISTORY.pdf"></a>, then a record for a professional sports franchise. Tose's first official act was to fire Coach <a href="Joe_Kuharich" title="wikilink">Joe Kuharich</a>. He followed this by naming former Eagles receiving great <a href="Pete_Retzlaff" title="wikilink">Pete Retzlaff</a> as <a href="General_Manager" title="wikilink">General Manager</a> and <a href="Jerry_Williams" title="wikilink">Jerry Williams</a> as coach.</p>
<p>In 1976 he, along with <a href="General_Manager" title="wikilink">General Manager</a> <a href="Jim_Murray_(football)" title="wikilink">Jimmy Murray</a>, lured <a href="Dick_Vermeil" title="wikilink">Dick Vermeil</a> from <a href="UCLA" class="uri" title="wikilink">UCLA</a> to coach the hapless Eagles, who had one winning season from 1962-75. Vermeil's 1980 team lost to <a href="Oakland_Raiders" title="wikilink">Oakland</a> in the <a href="Super_Bowl" title="wikilink">Super Bowl</a>. In January 1983, Tose announced that his daughter, Susan Fletcher, the Eagles' vice president and legal counsel, would eventually succeed him as primary owner of the Eagles.</p>
<p>In 1985 Tose was forced to sell the Eagles to <a href="Norman_Braman" title="wikilink">Norman Braman</a> and Ed Leibowitz, highly successful automobile dealers from <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a>, for a reported $65 million to pay off his more than $25 million in gambling debts at <a href="Atlantic_City" title="wikilink">Atlantic City</a> casinos.</p>
<h2 id="lifestyle">Lifestyle</h2>
<p>A slim, suave man who was always well dressed, Mr. Tose was, by his admission, a compulsive gambler and an alcoholic with a lifestyle others called flamboyant and he called comfortable. He and the fourth of his five wives had matching Rolls-Royces. Mr. Tose flew to Eagles home games in a helicopter, was married aboard the liner Queen Elizabeth 2 and fed reporters filet mignon and shrimp cocktail.</p>
<h2 id="after-the-eagles">After the Eagles</h2>
<p>In 1991, the <a href="Sands_Hotel_and_Casino" title="wikilink">Sands</a> sued him for $1.23 million in gambling debts. He countersued, contending that the casino got him too drunk to know what he was doing. Eventually, the casino won. There was testimony from a cocktail waitress swearing that her job description was &quot;to keep Mr. Tose's glass filled.&quot; A monogrammed glass, courtesy of the casino, which she kept filled with top-shelf scotch.</p>
<p>In the end, he lost it all, by his estimate more than $20 million at Resorts International and $14 million at the Sands. In 1996, on his 81st birthday, Tose was evicted from his seven-bedroom <a href="Villanova" class="uri" title="wikilink">Villanova</a> mansion after losing the house in a <a href="United_States_Marshals_Service" title="wikilink">U.S. Marshal's</a> sale.</p>
<p>In 1999, he told a congressional hearing on compulsive gambling that his losses totaled between $40 million and $50 million. He spent his last years alone in a <a href="Center_City_Philadelphia" title="wikilink">downtown</a> hotel room. Mr. Tose died in his sleep in the hospice wing of St. Agnes Medical Center in <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>. He was 88. An obituary by Dan Dunkin captured his life: &quot;To put Leonard Tose's life in football terms, he threw on every down.&quot;*</p>
