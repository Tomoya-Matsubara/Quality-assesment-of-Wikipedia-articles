<p>The <strong>Sonestown Covered Bridge</strong> is a <a href="Burr_Truss" title="wikilink">Burr arch truss</a> <a href="covered_bridge" title="wikilink">covered bridge</a> over <a href="Muncy_Creek" title="wikilink">Muncy Creek</a> in <a href="Davidson_Township,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Davidson Township</a>, <a href="Sullivan_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Sullivan County</a>, in the <a href="U.S._state" title="wikilink">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a>. Built <em>circa</em> 1850, the bridge is  long, and was placed on the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a> (NRHP) in 1980.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The bridge is named for the nearby <a href="unincorporated_area" title="wikilink">unincorporated</a> <a href="village" class="uri" title="wikilink">village</a> of Sonestown in Davidson Township, and is also known as the Davidson Covered Bridge. It was built to provide access to a <a href="gristmill" class="uri" title="wikilink">gristmill</a>, which operated until the early 20th century.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania had the first covered bridge in the United States and the most such bridges in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. In most places in the state they were a transition between stone and metal bridges, with the roof and sides protecting the wooden structure from weather. The Sonestown bridge is a Burr arch truss type, with a <a href="Structural_engineering" title="wikilink">load-bearing</a> <a href="arch" class="uri" title="wikilink">arch</a> sandwiching multiple vertical <a href="Truss#King_post_truss" title="wikilink">king posts</a>, for strength and rigidity. The bridge construction is cruder than the other two surviving covered bridges in Sullivan County, with each Burr arch formed from six straight beams set at angles instead of a smooth curve.</p>
<p>The bridge was repaired <em>circa</em> 1969, and after flood damage in 1996 and 2005. It was also restored in 2001. Despite the repairs and restoration, as of 2006 the bridge structure's sufficiency rating on the <a href="National_Bridge_Inventory" title="wikilink">National Bridge Inventory</a> was only 18.6 percent and its condition was deemed &quot;basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action&quot;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is the shortest covered bridge in the county and is still in use, with average daily traffic of 50 vehicles in 2006.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The covered bridge crosses Muncy Creek in Davidson Township on Champion Hill Road (Township Road 310), just east of <a href="U.S._Route_220" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 220</a>. The village of Sonestown is  north of the bridge on Route 220 and has given the Sonestown Covered Bridge its name.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The bridge is also  east of the village of Muncy Valley along Route 220.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Its official name on the NRHP is Sonestown Covered Bridge.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> It is also known as the Davidson Covered Bridge, for its township.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Sullivan County is located in north central Pennsylvania, about  northwest of <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a> and  east-northeast of <a href="Pittsburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Sonestown_Covered_Bridge_side_panorama.jpg" title="fig:The south side of the bridge in October 2008" alt="The south side of the bridge in October 2008" /> The area that became Davidson Township was first settled in 1806 and was incorporated as a township in 1833.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Within the township, George Sones built a sawmill and founded the unincorporated village of Sonestown in 1843.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> All of these events occurred before Sullivan County was formed from part of <a href="Lycoming_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Lycoming County</a> on March 14, 1847.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The bridge was built in 1850, and in the late 1800s Sonestown &quot;boomed like crazy&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> as the lumber industry grew in Sullivan County. The village was then home to a plant that manufactured the staves for making barrels. It had a <a href="clothespin" class="uri" title="wikilink">clothespin</a> factory from 1903 to 1929 but lost almost all industry by the 1930s. As of 1996, Sonestown had a population of about 200, most of whom commuted to work in <a href="Muncy,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Muncy</a>, <a href="Montoursville,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Montoursville</a>, and <a href="Williamsport,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Williamsport</a>.

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>The first covered bridge in the United States was built in 1800 over the <a href="Schuylkill_River" title="wikilink">Schuylkill River</a> in Philadelphia. According to Susan M. Zacher, author of <em>The Covered Bridges of Pennsylvania: A Guide</em>, the first covered bridges of the Burr arch truss design were also built in the state. Pennsylvania is estimated to have once had at least 1,500 covered bridges and is believed to have had the most in the country between 1830 and 1875.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In 2001, Pennsylvania had more surviving historic covered bridges than any other state, with 221 remaining in 40 of its 67 counties.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Sonestown_Covered_Bridge_16.jpg" title="fig:The south side and east portal of the bridge and site of the former mill in December 2008" alt="The south side and east portal of the bridge and site of the former mill in December 2008" /> Covered bridges were a transition between stone and metal bridges, the latter made of cast-iron or steel. In 19th-century Pennsylvania, lumber was an abundant resource for bridge construction,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> but wood did not last long when exposed to the elements. The roof and enclosed sides of covered bridges protected the structural elements, allowing some of these bridges to survive for well over a century. A Burr arch truss consists of a <a href="Structural_engineering" title="wikilink">load-bearing</a> <a href="arch" class="uri" title="wikilink">arch</a> sandwiching multiple <a href="Truss#King_post_truss" title="wikilink">king posts</a>, resulting in a stronger and more rigid structure than one made of either element alone.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Although there were 30 covered bridges in Sullivan County in 1890, only five were left by 1954, and as of 2008 only three remain: <a href="Forksville_Covered_Bridge" title="wikilink">Forksville</a>, <a href="Hillsgrove_Covered_Bridge" title="wikilink">Hillsgrove</a>, and Sonestown.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="construction-and-description">Construction and description</h3>
<p>All three Sullivan County covered bridges were built in or <em>circa</em> 1850 with Burr arch trusses.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> At the time of its construction, the Sonestown bridge was the fifth covered bridge in Sullivan County.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The bridge crossed <a href="Muncy_Creek" title="wikilink">Muncy Creek</a> to provide access to Johnny Hazen's gristmill,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> which was also built in 1850.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Although sources do not list the builder of the Sonestown bridge, a 1997 newspaper article on the remaining Sullivan County covered bridges reported that Sadler Rodgers had designed it.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Rogers, a native of <a href="Forksville,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Forksville</a>, built both the Forksville and Hillsgrove bridges in 1850, when he was 18 years old.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>On July 24, 1980, the Sonestown bridge was listed on the NRHP in a <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places#Multiple_Property_Submission" title="wikilink">Multiple Property Submission</a> of seven <a href="Covered_Bridges_of_Bradford,_Sullivan_and_Lycoming_Counties" title="wikilink">Covered Bridges of Bradford, Sullivan and Lycoming Counties</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The Sonestown bridge is also on the 2006 National Bridge Inventory (NBI), which lists the covered bridge as  long, with a roadway  wide, and a maximum load of .<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> However, the maximum load posted beside the bridge itself is only . According to the NRHP, the bridge's &quot;road surface width&quot; is ,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> which is only sufficient for a single lane of traffic.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Sonestown_Covered_Bridge_7.jpg" title="fig:Bridge interior showing the angular Burr arches, with the arch on the left (north side) taller than that on the right (south side)." alt="Bridge interior showing the angular Burr arches, with the arch on the left (north side) taller than that on the right (south side)." /> According to the NRHP form, the Sonestown bridge &quot;is of lighter construction than similar bridges in south-eastern Pennsylvania&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The covered bridge rests on <a href="abutment" title="wikilink">abutments</a> of stone and mortar, which have been reinforced with concrete. The portals are flanked by wing walls below the level of the road;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> these extend out from the abutments at an angle and &quot;retain the soil of the approach embankment&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>The bridge deck is made of wide boards laid perpendicular to the axis of the bridge, with two runners on top of the deck which run the length of the bridge.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The Burr arches which support the bridge are cruder than those in the other two Sullivan County covered bridges; they are not smooth &quot;continuous arcs, but several straight segments joined at an angle&quot;.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The top of the Burr arch on the south (downstream) side of the bridge is noticeably lower than the top of the arch on the north (upstream) side.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Vertical boards cover the sides and portals of the bridge and are painted red.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The bridge has no windows but does have openings between the <a href="eave" title="wikilink">eaves</a> and the siding which run the length of the bridge on both sides. The gable roof is covered with wooden <a href="Shake_(shingle)" title="wikilink">shake shingles</a>. A sign listing the vertical clearance as  is posted above each portal.

<p>Attitudes towards covered bridges in Sullivan County changed considerably in the last half of the 20th century. Two of the five bridges that remained in 1954 were razed by 1970, when the <a href="Pennsylvania_Department_of_Transportation" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Department of Transportation</a> considered tearing down the Forksville bridge (but renovated it because of its historic nature and appeal to tourists).<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The Hillsgrove Covered Bridge was added to the NRHP in 1973, and the two other bridges were added in 1980. The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission requires its approval for renovation work on NRHP bridges in the state, and forbids the destruction of these bridges.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Sonestown_Covered_Bridge_13.jpg" title="fig:Underside of the bridge, with riprap (large rocks) protecting the west abutment" alt="Underside of the bridge, with riprap (large rocks) protecting the west abutment" /> In the 19th century the Sonestown Covered Bridge survived major floods on March 1, 1865 and June 1, 1889, that destroyed other bridges in the West Branch Susquehanna River valley. The latter flood was caused by the same storm system that caused the <a href="Johnstown_Flood" title="wikilink">Johnstown Flood</a>, which killed over 2,200 people.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> In 1885, the <a href="Williamsport_and_North_Branch_Railroad" title="wikilink">Williamsport and North Branch Railroad</a> line along Muncy Creek reached Sonestown, passing just east of the bridge. The railroad carried lumber, coal, and passengers until it closed in 1938.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>The covered bridge was built to provide access to a gristmill,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> and the 1915 state highway map of Sullivan County shows a mill just downstream of the bridge on the east bank of Muncy Creek.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The 1941 map (using data from 1939) no longer shows a water-powered mill there, although it does show two buildings on the east bank of the creek, with one just upstream and one just downstream of the bridge.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Both of these buildings had disappeared by 1999.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The NRHP form states that the bridge had been recently repaired in 1969, and that additional maintenance work was needed. The repairs done at that time included replacing some of the siding panels, reinforcing the abutments with concrete, and &quot;very minor addition of steel to the truss structure&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>In January 1996, there was major flooding throughout Pennsylvania. A <a href="North_American_blizzard_of_1996" title="wikilink">blizzard</a> from January 6–8 produced up to  of snow, which was followed on January 19–21 by more than  of rain with temperatures as high as  and winds up to . The rain and snowmelt caused flooding throughout Pennsylvania, and <a href="ice_dam" title="wikilink">ice jams</a> made the flooding worse on many streams. In neighboring Lycoming County, flooding on <a href="Lycoming_Creek" title="wikilink">Lycoming Creek</a> in and near Williamsport killed six and caused millions of dollars in damage,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> and an ice jam on <a href="Plunketts_Creek_(Loyalsock_Creek)" title="wikilink">Plunketts Creek</a> destroyed a mid-19th century <a href="Plunketts_Creek_Bridge_No._3" title="wikilink">stone arch bridge</a> which was also on the NRHP.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The pressure of the flood on the Sonestown Covered Bridge moved the center of the structure almost  downstream. This and other major damage closed the bridge from January until late December, 1996. It was one of 69 publicly-owned bridges in Pennsylvania destroyed or closed by the flooding.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Sullivan County owns the bridge and paid for its repair, which was mandated by the state since it is listed on the NRHP. The original bid was for $93,000,<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> and the repair was done by Lycoming Supply Inc. of Williamsport for $89,000 over 60 days between mid-November and Christmas.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The bridge's closure caused a  detour for those who normally used the bridge to reach their homes and businesses.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

Since beer trucks could not cross it, deliveries to the <a href="American_Legion" title="wikilink">American Legion</a> Post southeast of the bridge were made with a hand cart instead.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> On November 12, 2000, a new &quot;Veterans Memorial Bridge&quot; just downstream of the covered bridge was dedicated.

<p>According to NBI data, the covered bridge was restored in 2001.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> In September 2004, flooding from <a href="Hurricane_Ivan" title="wikilink">Hurricane Ivan</a> followed by heavy rains in April 2005 made a hole in one of the covered bridge's abutments and weakened a structural support. Repair work took six weeks and was done by mid-August 2005.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> August of that same year saw placement of <a href="riprap" class="uri" title="wikilink">riprap</a> and fill in the creek to further protect the abutments, with the work done by Rexer's Drilling and Concrete of <a href="Dushore,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Dushore</a> for $9,250. Erosion in September 2004 had destroyed a house  upstream of the bridge, so the Sullivan County Commissioners planned additional work to stabilize the creek bed and prevent further erosion damage. The work, on private property and requiring permission from the <a href="Pennsylvania_Department_of_Environmental_Protection" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection</a>,<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> was done in the summer of 2006.</p>
<p>The NRHP form describes the bridge's condition as &quot;fair&quot; in 1969 and &quot;good&quot; in 1980.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Zacher's 1994 book and the Evans 2001 book also listed it as in &quot;good&quot; condition.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Despite this and the repairs and restoration, the 2006 <a href="Federal_Highway_Administration" title="wikilink">Federal Highway Administration</a> <a href="National_Bridge_Inventory" title="wikilink">National Bridge Inventory</a> found the sufficiency rating of the bridge structure to be only 18.6 percent.
