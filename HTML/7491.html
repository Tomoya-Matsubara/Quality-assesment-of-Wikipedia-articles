He was the first coach for the <a href="Kansas_Jayhawks_football" title="wikilink">Kansas football team</a>, when he served as a player-coach in 1890. He also competed on the KU rowing team, winning the 1 mile 2 man rowing competition along with Charles Orton Lasley in 1892 with a time of 6:04.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Will was a track &amp; field athlete while at KU, as well.

<p>Coleman was born in 1869 in Kentucky to Leonidas William Coleman(July 20, 1842–1929) and Fena Coleman. At the age of one his family moved from Kentucky to rural <a href="Chase_County,_Kansas" title="wikilink">Chase County, Kansas</a> just outside of <a href="Strong_City,_Kansas" title="wikilink">Strong City</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> where he went on to become an athletic star at Chase County high school in <a href="Cottonwood_Falls,_Kansas" title="wikilink">Cottonwood Falls, Kansas</a>. After graduating from Chase County high school he attended the <a href="University_of_Kansas" title="wikilink">University of Kansas</a> in <a href="Lawrence,_Kansas" title="wikilink">Lawrence, Kansas</a> where he played football from 1890 through 1894. He was the starting center and lettered all five years he was at KU.</p>
<p>For several years during Coleman's time at Kansas, KU ran what was known as the <a href="Flying_wedge#Sports" title="wikilink">Flying V</a> formation on offense where the center, Will's position, is the point of the &quot;V&quot; leading the way for the ball carrier and other blockers and takes the brunt of the punishment from defensive players. This formation proved so dangerous and lead to so many severe injuries that it was later banned in both collegiate and pro football.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="coaching-career">Coaching career</h2>
<p>Will Coleman coached the Jayhawks in what is widely considered the <a href="1890_Kansas_vs._Baker_football_game" title="wikilink">first college football game</a> played in the state of Kansas.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> As listed by the <a href="College_Football_Data_Warehouse" title="wikilink">College Football Data Warehouse</a>, he served as the first head coach for the <a href="Kansas_Jayhawks_football" title="wikilink">Kansas football team</a>, coaching for a single season in 1890 and tallying a mark of 1–2.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The team actually went 2–1 on the field, but their last game against Baker University, which was initially won by KU with a score of 14 to 12, was awarded to Baker on a technicality.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1890 Kansas Jayhawks football team was not officially associated with the <a href="University_of_Kansas" title="wikilink">University of Kansas</a>. Coleman was not an employee or a faculty member of the University of Kansas, but instead a KU student who played <a href="Center_(American_football)" title="wikilink">center</a> on the football team. The first Jayhawks football coach recognized by the University of Kansas was faculty member <a href="Edwin_Mortimer_Hopkins" title="wikilink">Edwin Mortimer Hopkins</a>, who helmed the team the next season in 1891.</p>
