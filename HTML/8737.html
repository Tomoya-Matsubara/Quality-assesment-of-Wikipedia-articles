<p><strong>Emanuel David Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili</strong> (born 28 July 1977 in <a href="Bah&lt;U+00ED&gt;a_Blanca" title="wikilink">Bah&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Blanca</a>, <a href="Argentina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Argentina</a>), better known as Manu Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili, is an <a href="Argentine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Argentine</a> basketball player of <a href="Italian_people" title="wikilink">Italian descent</a>. Coming from a family of professional basketballers, he is a member of the <a href="Argentine_national_basketball_team" title="wikilink">Argentine national basketball team</a> and the <a href="San_Antonio_Spurs" title="wikilink">San Antonio Spurs</a> in the <a href="National_Basketball_Association" title="wikilink">National Basketball Association</a> (NBA).</p>
<p>Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili spent the early half of his basketball career in Argentina and <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, where he won several individual and team honors. His stint with Italian side <a href="Kinder_Bologna" title="wikilink">Kinder Bologna</a> was particularly productive, earning two <a href="Serie_A_(basketball)" title="wikilink">Lega A</a> <a href="Most_Valuable_Player" title="wikilink">Most Valuable Player</a> awards, one <a href="Euroleague" class="uri" title="wikilink">Euroleague</a> MVP award and the 2001 League Championship. The San Antonio Spurs drafted the shooting guard as the 57th overall pick in the <a href="1999_NBA_Draft" title="wikilink">1999 NBA Draft</a>, but Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili only joined the Spurs in 2002. He did not take long to establish himself as a key player for the Spurs, and has since won three NBA championships with the <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a> side as well as being named an <a href="NBA_All-Star" title="wikilink">All-Star</a> once.</p>
<p>With the national team, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili has also enjoyed success. He made his d&lt;U+00E9&gt;but in 1998, and was a member of the team which won the goal medal during the <a href="2004_Olympics" title="wikilink">2004 Olympics</a>. Hailed as one of the finest Europe-based players to grace the NBA with his high-tempo and intensive game, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili is also the only basketball player ever to win a Euroleague title, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal.</p>

<p>Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili comes from a family of basketball players. His older brothers Sebasti&lt;U+00E1&gt;n and Leandro have played professionally in Argentina and Spain respectively, while their father Jorge was a coach at a club in <a href="Bah&lt;U+00ED&gt;a_Blanca" title="wikilink">Bah&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Blanca</a>, where Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili learned to play the game.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Given the proliferation of basketball clubs in Bah&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Blanca and his idolization of <a href="Michael_Jordan" title="wikilink">Michael Jordan</a>, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili's love for basketball grew rapidly.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Like many Argentines, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili is a descendant of <a href="Italy" title="wikilink">Italian</a> immigrants, and he has <a href="dual_citizenship" title="wikilink">dual citizenship</a> with Argentina and Italy.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> As a result of his travels, he can speak <a href="Spanish_language" title="wikilink">Spanish</a>, <a href="Italian_language" title="wikilink">Italian</a> and <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> fluently.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In his free time, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili enjoys surfing the internet, listening to <a href="Latin_music" title="wikilink">Latin music</a>, watching movies and relaxing with his friends.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In 2004, he married Marie Orono.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

His highlight of the tournament was probably his game-winning <a href="buzzer_beater" title="wikilink">buzzer beater</a> with 0.7 seconds remaining, on the opening day of the Olympics, in a game versus <a href="Serbia_and_Montenegro_national_basketball_team" title="wikilink">Serbia and Montenegro</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili was also named the <a href="Most_Valuable_Player" title="wikilink">Most Valuable Player</a> of the tournament, as he led the team in both scoring (19.3 ppg) and assists (3.3 apg).<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="player-profile">Player profile</h2>

<p>Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili is a 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m), 205 lb (93 kg) <a href="shooting_guard" title="wikilink">shooting guard</a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> who has been deployed either as a <a href="sixth_man" title="wikilink">sixth man</a> or starter for the Spurs. He has established himself as a reliable and versatile backcourt presence, and is a relatively late bloomer, entering the NBA at age 25 in a period where <a href="prep-to-pro" title="wikilink">entering the NBA as a teenager</a> was very common.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Alongside teammates <a href="Tony_Parker" title="wikilink">Tony Parker</a> and Tim Duncan, he forms one of the centerpieces of San Antonio's game.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Apart from his up-tempo and aggressive style of play, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili is known for his <a href="clutch_(sports)" title="wikilink">clutch play</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> This is documented by his numerous European league MVP awards, 2004 Olympic tournament MVP, and his performances in San Antonio's 2004-05 championship-winning campaign. Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili's <em><a href="modus_operandi" title="wikilink">modus operandi</a></em> however, is a source of consternation for some of his opponents.
