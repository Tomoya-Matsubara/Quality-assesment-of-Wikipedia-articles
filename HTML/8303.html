<p><strong>Bryce Canyon National Park</strong> () is a <a href="national_park" title="wikilink">national park</a> located in southwestern <a href="Utah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Utah</a> in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. Contained within the park is <strong>Bryce Canyon</strong>. Despite its name, this is not actually a <a href="canyon" class="uri" title="wikilink">canyon</a>, but rather a giant natural <a href="amphitheatre" title="wikilink">amphitheater</a> created by <a href="erosion" class="uri" title="wikilink">erosion</a> along the eastern side of the <a href="Paunsaugunt_Plateau" title="wikilink">Paunsaugunt Plateau</a>. Bryce is distinctive due to its <a href="geology" title="wikilink">geological</a> structures, called <em><a href="hoodoo_(geology)" title="wikilink">hoodoos</a></em>, formed from <a href="wind" class="uri" title="wikilink">wind</a>, water, and ice erosion of the river and lakebed <a href="sedimentary_rock" title="wikilink">sedimentary rocks</a>. The red, orange and white colors of the <a href="rock_(geology)" title="wikilink">rocks</a> provide spectacular views to visitors.</p>
<p>Bryce is at a much higher elevation than nearby <a href="Zion_National_Park" title="wikilink">Zion National Park</a> and the <a href="Grand_Canyon" title="wikilink">Grand Canyon</a>. The rim at Bryce varies from 8,000 to 9,000 feet (2400 to 2700 m), whereas the south rim of the Grand Canyon sits at 7,000 feet (2100 m) above <a href="sea_level" title="wikilink">sea level</a>. The area therefore has a very different <a href="ecology" class="uri" title="wikilink">ecology</a> and <a href="climate" class="uri" title="wikilink">climate</a>, and thus offers a contrast for visitors to the region (who often visit all three parks in a single vacation).</p>
<p>The canyon area was settled by <a href="Mormon_pioneers" title="wikilink">Mormon pioneers</a> in the 1850s and was named after <a href="Ebenezer_Bryce" title="wikilink">Ebenezer Bryce</a>, who <a href="homesteading" title="wikilink">homesteaded</a> in the area in 1875. The area around Bryce Canyon became a <a href="U.S._National_Monument" title="wikilink">U.S. National Monument</a> in 1924 and was designated as a <a href="National_Park_Service" title="wikilink">national park</a> in 1928. The park covers 56 mi&lt;U+00B2&gt; (145 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;). The park receives relatively few visitors compared to Zion Canyon and the Grand Canyon, largely due to its remote location. The town of <a href="Kanab,_Utah" title="wikilink">Kanab, Utah</a> is situated at a central point between these three parks.</p>
<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p><img src="Bryce_Canyon_road_map.jpg" title="fig:Bryce Canyon follows a meandering course, oriented roughly north-south." alt="Bryce Canyon follows a meandering course, oriented roughly north-south." width="100" /> Bryce Canyon National Park is located in southern <a href="Utah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Utah</a> about 50 miles (80 km) northeast and 1000 feet (300 m) higher than <a href="Zion_National_Park" title="wikilink">Zion National Park</a>. The <a href="weather" class="uri" title="wikilink">weather</a> in Bryce Canyon is therefore cooler, and the park receives more <a href="precipitation_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">precipitation</a>. A nearby example, very similar to Bryce Canyon but at a higher elevation, is in <a href="Cedar_Breaks_National_Monument" title="wikilink">Cedar Breaks National Monument</a>.</p>
<p>The national park lies within the <a href="Colorado_Plateau" title="wikilink">Colorado Plateau</a> <a href="United_States_physiographic_region" title="wikilink">geographic province</a> of <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a> and straddles the southeastern edge of the <a href="Paunsagunt_Plateau" title="wikilink">Paunsagunt Plateau</a> west of the Paunsagunt Fault (<em>Paunsagunt</em> is <a href="Paiute" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paiute</a> for &quot;home of the <a href="beaver" class="uri" title="wikilink">beaver</a>&quot;). Park visitors arrive from the plateau part of the park and look over the plateau's edge toward a valley containing the fault and the <a href="Paria_River" title="wikilink">Paria River</a> just beyond it (<em>Paria</em> is Paiute for &quot;muddy or elk water&quot;). The edge of the <a href="Kaiparowits_Plateau" title="wikilink">Kaiparowits Plateau</a> bounds the opposite side of the valley.</p>
<p>Bryce Canyon was not formed from <a href="erosion" class="uri" title="wikilink">erosion</a> initiated from a central <a href="stream" class="uri" title="wikilink">stream</a>, meaning it technically is not a <a href="canyon" class="uri" title="wikilink">canyon</a>. Instead <a href="headward_erosion" title="wikilink">headward erosion</a> has excavated large <a href="amphitheatre" title="wikilink">amphitheater</a>-shaped features in the <a href="Cenozoic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cenozoic</a>-aged rocks of the Paunsagunt Plateau. This erosion exposed delicate and colorful pinnacles called <a href="hoodoo_(geology)" title="wikilink">hoodoos</a> that are up to 200 feet (60 m) high. A series of amphitheaters extend more than 20 miles (30 km) within the park. The largest is <a href="Bryce_Amphitheater" title="wikilink">Bryce Amphitheater</a>, which is <span style="white-space:nowrap">12 miles (19 km)</span> long, <span style="white-space:nowrap">3 miles (5 km)</span> wide and <span style="white-space:nowrap">800 feet (240 m)</span> deep.</p>
<p>The highest part of the park at 9,105 feet (2,775 m), <a href="Rainbow_Point" title="wikilink">Rainbow Point</a>, is at the end of this scenic drive. From there, <a href="Aquarius_Plateau" title="wikilink">Aquarius Plateau</a>, Bryce Amphitheater, the <a href="Henry_Mountains" title="wikilink">Henry Mountains</a>, the <a href="Vermilion_Cliffs" title="wikilink">Vermilion Cliffs</a> and the <a href="White_Cliffs_(Jurassic)" title="wikilink">White Cliffs</a> can be seen. Cope Canyon, where it exits the park in the north-east section, is the lowest part of the park at 6,600 feet (2,011 m).</p>

<h3 id="native-american-habitation">Native American habitation</h3>
<p>Little is known about early human habitation in the Bryce Canyon area. Archaeological surveys of Bryce Canyon National Park and the <a href="Paunsaugunt_Plateau" title="wikilink">Paunsaugunt Plateau</a> show that people have been in the area for at least 10,000 years. <a href="Basketmaker-period" class="uri" title="wikilink">Basketmaker-period</a> <a href="Anasazi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anasazi</a> artifacts several thousand years old have been found south of the park. Other artifacts from the <a href="Pueblo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pueblo</a>-period Anasazi and the <a href="Fremont_people" title="wikilink">Fremont culture</a> (up to the mid-12th century) have also been found.</p>
<p>The <a href="Paiute" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paiute</a> Indians moved into the surrounding valleys and plateaus in the area around the same time that the other cultures left. These <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native Americans</a> hunted and gathered for most of their food, but also supplemented their diet with some cultivated products. The Paiute in the area developed a <a href="Native_American_mythology" title="wikilink">mythology</a> surrounding the hoodoos (pinnacles) in Bryce Canyon. They believed that hoodoos were the Legend People whom the trickster <a href="Coyote_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Coyote</a> turned to stone. At least one older Paiute said his culture called the hoodoos <em>Anka-ku-wass-a-wits</em>, which is Paiute for &quot;red painted faces&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="white-exploration-and-settlement">White exploration and settlement</h3>
<p>It was not until the late 18th and the early 19th century that the first <a href="Caucasian_race" title="wikilink">Caucasians</a> explored the remote and hard to reach area. <a href="Mormon_pioneers" title="wikilink">Mormon scouts</a> visited the area in the 1850s to gauge its potential for <a href="agriculture" title="wikilink">agricultural</a> development, use for <a href="grazing" class="uri" title="wikilink">grazing</a>, and settlement.</p>
<p>The first major scientific expedition to the area was led by <a href="United_States_Army" title="wikilink">U.S. Army</a> Major <a href="John_Wesley_Powell" title="wikilink">John Wesley Powell</a> in 1872. Powell, along with a team of mapmakers and geologists, surveyed the <a href="Sevier_River" title="wikilink">Sevier</a> and <a href="Virgin_River" title="wikilink">Virgin River</a> area as part of a larger survey of the <a href="Colorado_Plateau" title="wikilink">Colorado Plateaus</a>. His mapmakers kept many of the Paiute place names.</p>
<p><img src="Bryce_Cabin_circa_1881.jpg" title="fig:Ebenezer Bryce and his family lived in Bryce Canyon, in this cabin, here photographed circa 1881." alt="Ebenezer Bryce and his family lived in Bryce Canyon, in this cabin, here photographed circa 1881." /> Small groups of Mormon pioneers followed and attempted to settle east of Bryce Canyon along the <a href="Paria_River" title="wikilink">Paria River</a>. In 1873 the <a href="Kanarra_Cattle_Company" title="wikilink">Kanarra Cattle Company</a> started to use the area for <a href="cattle" class="uri" title="wikilink">cattle</a> grazing.</p>
<p><a href="The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints" title="wikilink">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> sent <a href="Scottish_American" title="wikilink">Scottish</a> immigrant Ebenezer Bryce and his wife Mary to settle land in the Paria Valley because they thought his carpentry skills would be useful in the area. The Bryce family chose to live right below Bryce Canyon Amphitheater. Bryce grazed his cattle inside what are now park borders, and reputedly thought that the amphitheaters were a &quot;helluva place to lose a cow.&quot; (Many living members of the Bryce family refute this statement because Bryce would not have used profanity.) He also built a road to the plateau to retrieve firewood and timber, and a <a href="canal" class="uri" title="wikilink">canal</a> to irrigate his crops and water his animals. Other settlers soon started to call the unusual place &quot;Bryce's canyon&quot;, which was later formalized into Bryce Canyon.</p>
<p>A combination of <a href="drought" class="uri" title="wikilink">drought</a>, <a href="overgrazing" class="uri" title="wikilink">overgrazing</a> and <a href="flood" title="wikilink">flooding</a> eventually drove the remaining Paiutes from the area and prompted the settlers to attempt construction of a water diversion channel from the Sevier River drainage. When that effort failed, most of the settlers, including the Bryce family, left the area. Bryce moved his family to <a href="Arizona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arizona</a> in 1880. The remaining settlers did manage to dig a 10 mile (16 km) long ditch from the Sevier's east fork into Tropic Valley.</p>
<h3 id="creation-of-the-park">Creation of the park</h3>
<p>People like Forest Supervisor <a href="J._W._Humphrey" title="wikilink">J. W. Humphrey</a> promoted the scenic wonders of Bryce Canyon's amphitheaters, and by 1918 nationally distributed articles also helped to spark interest. However, poor access to the remote area and the lack of accommodations kept visitation to a bare minimum.</p>
<p><a href="Ruby_Syrett" title="wikilink">Ruby Syrett</a>, <a href="Harold_Bowman" title="wikilink">Harold Bowman</a> and the Perry brothers later built modest lodging, and set up &quot;touring services&quot; in the area. Syrett later served as the first <a href="postmaster" class="uri" title="wikilink">postmaster</a> of Bryce Canyon. Visitation steadily increased, and by the early 1920s the <a href="Union_Pacific_Railroad" title="wikilink">Union Pacific Railroad</a> became interested in expanding <a href="Rail_transport_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">rail service</a> into southwestern Utah to accommodate more tourists.</p>
<p>At the same time, <a href="conservation_ethic" title="wikilink">conservationists</a> became alarmed by the damage <a href="overgrazing" class="uri" title="wikilink">overgrazing</a> and <a href="logging" class="uri" title="wikilink">logging</a> on the plateau, along with unregulated visitation, were having on the fragile features of Bryce Canyon. A movement to have the area protected was soon started, and <a href="National_Park_Service" title="wikilink">National Park Service</a> Director <a href="Stephen_Mather" title="wikilink">Stephen Mather</a> responded by proposing that Bryce Canyon be made into a state park. The <a href="governor_of_Utah" title="wikilink">governor of Utah</a> and the <a href="Utah_Legislature" title="wikilink">Utah Legislature</a>, however, lobbied for national protection of the area. Mather relented and sent his recommendation to President <a href="Warren_G._Harding" title="wikilink">Warren G. Harding</a>, who on <a href="June_8" title="wikilink">June 8</a> <a href="1923" class="uri" title="wikilink">1923</a> declared Bryce Canyon National Monument into existence.</p>
<p><img src="Bryce_Canyon_Lodge.jpg" title="fig:Bryce Canyon Lodge was built between 1924 and 1925 from local materials." alt="Bryce Canyon Lodge was built between 1924 and 1925 from local materials." /> A road was built the same year on the plateau to provide easy access to outlooks over the amphitheaters. From 1924 to 1925, <a href="Bryce_Canyon_Lodge" title="wikilink">Bryce Canyon Lodge</a> was built from local timber and stone.</p>
<p>In 1924, members of <a href="Congress_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">U.S. Congress</a> decided to start work on upgrading Bryce Canyon's protection status from a <a href="U.S._National_Monument" title="wikilink">U.S. National Monument</a> to a <a href="National_Park_Service" title="wikilink">National Park</a> to establish Utah National Park. A process of transferring ownership of private and state-held land in the monument to the federal government started, the <a href="Utah_Parks_Company" title="wikilink">Utah Parks Company</a> negotiating much of the transfer. The last of the land in the proposed park's borders was sold to the federal government four years later, and on <a href="February_25" title="wikilink">February 25</a> <a href="1928" class="uri" title="wikilink">1928</a>, the renamed Bryce Canyon National Park was established.</p>
<p><img src="Bryce_Canyon_visitors_center.jpg" title="fig:In 1928 the canyon became a National Park. It now has this visitors&#39; center." alt="In 1928 the canyon became a National Park. It now has this visitors&#39; center." /> In 1931, President <a href="Herbert_Hoover" title="wikilink">Herbert Hoover</a> annexed an adjoining area south of the park, and in 1942 an additional 635 acres (2.57 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;) was added. This brought the park's total area to the current figure of 35,835 acres (145.02 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;). Rim Road, the scenic drive that is still used today, was completed in 1934 by the <a href="Civilian_Conservation_Corps" title="wikilink">Civilian Conservation Corps</a>. Administration of the park was conducted from neighboring <a href="Zion_Canyon_National_Park" title="wikilink">Zion Canyon National Park</a> until 1956, when Bryce Canyon's first superintendent started work.</p>

<p>The <a href="USS_Bryce_Canyon" title="wikilink">USS <em>Bryce Canyon</em></a> was named for the park and served as a supply and repair ship in the <a href="United_States_Pacific_Fleet" title="wikilink">U.S. Pacific Fleet</a> from <a href="September_15" title="wikilink">September 15</a> <a href="1950" class="uri" title="wikilink">1950</a>, to <a href="June_30" title="wikilink">June 30</a> <a href="1981" class="uri" title="wikilink">1981</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="Bryce_Canyon_Natural_History_Association" title="wikilink">Bryce Canyon Natural History Association</a> (BCNHA)</strong> was established in 1961. It runs the bookstore inside the park visitor center and is a non-profit organization created to aid the interpretive, educational and scientific activities of the National Park Service, at Bryce Canyon National Park. A portion of the profits from all bookstore sales are donated to public land units. Since BCNHA's inception in 1961, donations have exceeded <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">$</a>3.5 million.</p>
<p>Responding to increased visitation and <a href="traffic_congestion" title="wikilink">traffic congestion</a>, the <a href="National_Park_Service" title="wikilink">National Park Service</a> implemented a voluntary, summer-only, in-park shuttle system in June 2000.

<h2 id="geology">Geology</h2>

<p><img src="Natural_bridge_in_Bryce_Canyon.jpg" title="fig:Erosion of sedimentary rocks has created natural arches." alt="Erosion of sedimentary rocks has created natural arches." /> The Bryce Canyon area shows a record of deposition that spans from the last part of the <a href="Cretaceous" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cretaceous</a> period and the first half of the <a href="Cenozoic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cenozoic</a> era. The ancient depositional environment of region around what is now the park varied:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="Dakota_Sandstone" title="wikilink">Dakota Sandstone</a> and the <a href="Tropic_Shale" title="wikilink">Tropic Shale</a> were deposited in the warm, shallow waters of the advancing and retreating <a href="Cretaceous_Seaway" title="wikilink">Cretaceous Seaway</a> (outcrops of these rocks are found just outside park borders).</li>
<li>The colorful <a href="Claron_Formation" title="wikilink">Claron Formation</a> that the park's delicate <a href="hoodoo_(geology)" title="wikilink">hoodoos</a> are carved from was laid down as sediments in a system of cool <a href="stream" title="wikilink">streams</a> and <a href="lake" title="wikilink">lakes</a> that existed from 63 to about 40 million years ago (from the <a href="Paleocene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paleocene</a> to the <a href="Eocene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eocene</a> epochs). Different sediment types were laid down as the lakes deepened and became shallow and as the shoreline and <a href="river_delta" title="wikilink">river deltas</a> migrated.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Bryce_Canyon_Hoodoos.jpg" title="fig:Hoodoos can form strange shapes due to random fluctuations in erosion patterns and variations between the rock strata." alt="Hoodoos can form strange shapes due to random fluctuations in erosion patterns and variations between the rock strata." /> Several other formations were also created but were mostly <a href="erosion" title="wikilink">eroded</a> away following two major periods of uplift:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="Laramide_orogeny" title="wikilink">Laramide orogeny</a> affected the entire western part of what would become <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a> starting about 70 million years ago and lasting for many millions of years after. This event helped to build the ancestral <a href="Rocky_Mountains" title="wikilink">Rocky Mountains</a> and in the process closed the Cretaceous Seaway. The Straight Cliffs, Wahweap, and Kaiparowits formations were victims of this uplift.</li>
<li>The <a href="Colorado_Plateau" title="wikilink">Colorado Plateaus</a> were uplifted 10 to 15 million years ago and were segmented into different <a href="plateau" title="wikilink">plateaus</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; each separated from its neighbors by <a href="fault_(geology)" title="wikilink">faults</a> and each having its own uplift rate. The <a href="Boat_Mesa_Conglomerate" title="wikilink">Boat Mesa Conglomerate</a> and the <a href="Sevier_River_Formation" title="wikilink">Sevier River Formation</a> were removed following this uplift.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vertical joints were created by this uplift, which were eventually (and still are) preferentially eroded. The easily eroded Pink Cliffs of the Claron Formation respond by forming freestanding pinnacles in <a href="badlands" class="uri" title="wikilink">badlands</a> called hoodoos, while the more resistant White Cliffs formed monoliths. The pink color is from <a href="iron_oxide" title="wikilink">iron oxide</a> and <a href="manganese" class="uri" title="wikilink">manganese</a>. Also created were arches, <a href="natural_arch" title="wikilink">natural bridges</a>, walls, and windows. Hoodoos are composed of soft sedimentary rock and are topped by a piece of harder, less easily eroded stone that protects the column from the elements. Bryce Canyon has one of the highest concentrations of hoodoos of any place on Earth.</p>
<p>The formations exposed in the area of the park are part of the <a href="Grand_Staircase" title="wikilink">Grand Staircase</a>. The oldest members of this supersequence of rock units are exposed in the <a href="Grand_Canyon" title="wikilink">Grand Canyon</a>, the intermediate ones in <a href="Zion_National_Park" title="wikilink">Zion National Park</a>, and its youngest parts are laid bare in Bryce Canyon area. A small amount of overlap occurs in and around each park.</p>
<h2 id="biology">Biology</h2>
<p>The <a href="forest" title="wikilink">forests</a> and <a href="meadow" title="wikilink">meadows</a> of Bryce Canyon provide the <a href="habitat_(ecology)" title="wikilink">habitat</a> to support diverse animal life, from <a href="bird" title="wikilink">birds</a> and small <a href="mammal" title="wikilink">mammals</a> to <a href="fox" title="wikilink">foxes</a> and occasional <a href="bobcat" title="wikilink">bobcats</a>, <a href="mountain_lion" title="wikilink">mountain lions</a>, and <a href="American_black_bear" title="wikilink">black bears</a>. <a href="Mule_deer" title="wikilink">Mule deer</a> are the most common large mammals in the park. <a href="Elk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elk</a> and <a href="pronghorn_antelope" title="wikilink">pronghorn antelope</a>, which have been reintroduced nearby, sometimes venture into the park. More than 160 species of birds visit the park each year, including <a href="swift" title="wikilink">swifts</a> and <a href="hirundinidae" title="wikilink">swallows</a>.</p>
<p>Most bird species migrate to warmer regions in winter, but <a href="jay" title="wikilink">jays</a>, <a href="raven" title="wikilink">ravens</a>, <a href="nuthatch" title="wikilink">nuthatches</a>, <a href="eagle" title="wikilink">eagles</a>, and <a href="owl" title="wikilink">owls</a> stay. In winter, the mule deer, mountain lion, and <a href="coyote" title="wikilink">coyotes</a> will migrate to lower elevations. <a href="Ground_squirrel" title="wikilink">Ground squirrels</a> and <a href="marmot" title="wikilink">marmots</a> pass the winter in <a href="hibernation" class="uri" title="wikilink">hibernation</a>.</p>

<p>While humans have greatly reduced the amount of habitat that is available to wildlife in most parts of the United States, the relative scarcity of water in southern Utah restricts human development and helps account for the region's greatly enhanced diversity of wildlife.</p>

<li>Mossy Cave (one hour, <a href="Utah_State_Route_12" title="wikilink">Utah State Route 12</a> northwest of Tropic), Rim Trail (5&lt;U+2013&gt;6 hours, anywhere on rim), Bristlecone Loop (one hour, Rainbow Point), and Queens Garden (1&lt;U+2013&gt;2 hours, Sunrise Point) are easy to moderate hikes.</li>
<li>Navajo Loop (1&lt;U+2013&gt;2 hours, Sunset Point) and Tower Bridge (2&lt;U+2013&gt;3 hours, north of Sunrise Point) are moderate hikes.</li>
<li>Fairyland Loop (4&lt;U+2013&gt;5 hours, Fairyland Point) and Peekaboo Loop (3&lt;U+2013&gt;4 hours, Bryce Point) are strenuous hikes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several of these trails intersect, allowing hikers to combine routes for more challenging hikes.</p>
<p>The park also has two trails designated for overnight hiking: the 9 mile (14 km) long Riggs Loop Trail and the <span style="white-space:nowrap">23 mile (37 km)</span> long Under the Rim Trail. Both require a backcountry camping permit. In total there are 50 miles (80 km) of trails in the park.</p>
<p>More than 10 miles (16 km) of marked but ungroomed <a href="skiing" class="uri" title="wikilink">skiing</a> trails are available off of Fairyland, Paria, and Rim trails in the park. Twenty miles (32 km) of connecting groomed ski trails are in nearby <a href="Dixie_National_Forest" title="wikilink">Dixie National Forest</a> and <a href="Ruby&#39;s_Inn" title="wikilink">Ruby's Inn</a>.</p>
<p><img src="Horseriders_in_Bryce_Canyon-NPS_photo.jpg" title="fig:Horse riding is available in the park from April through October." alt="Horse riding is available in the park from April through October." /> The air in the area is so clear that on most days from Yovimpa and Rainbow points, <a href="Navajo_Mountain" title="wikilink">Navajo Mountain</a> and the Kaibab Plateau can be seen 90 miles (140 km) away in <a href="Arizona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arizona</a>. On a really clear day the Black Mesas of eastern Arizona and western <a href="New_Mexico" title="wikilink">New Mexico</a> can be seen some 200 miles (320 km) away. The park also has a 7.3 magnitude night sky, making it the one of the darkest in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a>. Stargazers can therefore see 7500 <a href="star" title="wikilink">stars</a> with the <a href="naked_eye" title="wikilink">naked eye</a>, while in most places fewer than 2000 can be seen due to <a href="light_pollution" title="wikilink">light pollution</a> (in many large cities only a few dozen can be seen). Park rangers host several public stargazing events and evening programs on astronomy, nocturnal animals, and night sky protection. The Bryce Canyon Astronomy Festival, typically held in June, attracts thousands of visitors. In honor of this astronomy festival, <a href="49272_Bryce_Canyon" title="wikilink">Asteroid 49272</a> was named after the national park.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>There are two campgrounds in the park, North Campground and Sunset Campground. Loop A in North Campground is open year-round. Additional loops and Sunset Campground are open from late spring to early autumn. The 114-room <a href="Bryce_Canyon_Lodge" title="wikilink">Bryce Canyon Lodge</a> is another way to overnight in the park.</p>
<p>A favorite activity of most visitors is landscape photography. With Bryce Canyon's high altitude and clean air, the sunrise and sunset photographs can be spectacular.</p>
