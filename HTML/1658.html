<p><strong>Robert Richard Chappuis</strong> (born <a href="February_24" title="wikilink">February 24</a> <a href="1923" class="uri" title="wikilink">1923</a> in <a href="Toledo,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Toledo, Ohio</a>) is a former <a href="College_Football_All-America_Team" title="wikilink">All-American</a> <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">football</a> player who played for the <a href="University_of_Michigan" title="wikilink">University of Michigan</a> <a href="Michigan_Wolverines_football" title="wikilink">Wolverines</a> in 1942, 1946, and 1947. His college years were interrupted by service in the <a href="U.S._Army_Air_Forces" title="wikilink">U.S. Army Air Forces</a> during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. Chappuis flew 21 missions as a <a href="radio_operator" title="wikilink">radio operator</a> and <a href="air_gunner" title="wikilink">aerial gunner</a> on <a href="B-25_Mitchell" title="wikilink">B-25 bombers</a> in the <a href="European_Theatre_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">European Theater</a>. His aircraft was shot down in February 1945 in the <a href="Lombardy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lombardy</a> region of Northern Italy. Chappuis <a href="parachute" title="wikilink">parachuted</a> from the plane before it crashed and was rescued by <a href="Italian_resistance_movement" title="wikilink">Italian partisans</a> who hid Chappuis and two other crew members for three months until the end of the war.</p>
<p>After the war, Chappuis returned to Michigan where he broke the <a href="Big_Ten_Conference" title="wikilink">Big Nine Conference</a> record for total yards of offense in 1946 and then broke his own record in 1947. He led the <a href="1947_Michigan_Wolverines_football_team" title="wikilink">1947 Michigan team</a> known as the &lt;U+201C&gt;Mad Magicians&lt;U+201D&gt; to an undefeated season and a 49–0 win over the <a href="USC_Trojans_football" title="wikilink">USC Trojans</a> in the <a href="1948_Rose_Bowl" title="wikilink">1948 Rose Bowl</a> game. Chappuis was a unanimous <a href="College_Football_All-America_Team" title="wikilink">All-American</a> selection in <a href="1947_in_sports" title="wikilink">1947</a> and was named the Most Valuable Player of the 1948 Rose Bowl. His picture appeared on the cover of <em><a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Time</a></em> magazine in 1947 in connection with a feature article about Chappuis and the 1947 Wolverines. During his career he established many football records that lasted for over a generation. He continues to hold the Big Ten Conference single-season <a href="passer_rating" title="wikilink">passer rating</a> record and the <a href="Michigan_Wolverines" title="wikilink">Michigan Wolverines</a> single-season yards/completion records.</p>
<p>Chappuis played professional football in the <a href="All-America_Football_Conference" title="wikilink">All-America Football Conference</a> for the <a href="Brooklyn_Dodgers_(football)" title="wikilink">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> and <a href="Chicago_Hornets" title="wikilink">Chicago Hornets</a> in 1948 and 1949. He led the Dodgers in total offense in 1948 with 1,402 yards passing and 310 yards rushing. When both clubs and the AAFC folded, Chappuis retired from football in 1950. He was elected to the <a href="College_Football_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">College Football Hall of Fame</a> in <a href="1988_in_sports" title="wikilink">1988</a>.</p>

<p><img src="B-25J_Bomber.jpg" title="fig:B-25 Bomber" alt="B-25 Bomber" width="200" /> Chappuis' college program was interrupted by military service from 1943–1945. During <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, Chappuis served in the <a href="U.S._Army_Air_Forces" title="wikilink">U.S. Army Air Forces</a> and flew 21 missions as a <a href="radio_operator" title="wikilink">radio operator</a> and <a href="air_gunner" title="wikilink">aerial gunner</a> in <a href="B-25_Mitchell" title="wikilink">B-25 bombers</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> He flew his first mission targeting a railroad bridge in the heavily-fortified <a href="Brenner_Pass" title="wikilink">Brenner Pass</a> on Christmas Day 1944.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> On <a href="February_13" title="wikilink">February 13</a> <a href="1945" class="uri" title="wikilink">1945</a>, Chappuis flew his 21st mission when he was assigned to fill in for a sick crew member.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Chappuis&lt;U+2019&gt; B-25 bomber was assigned to bomb a railroad tunnel in the Italian mountains north of the <a href="Po_River" title="wikilink">Po River</a>. &lt;U+201C&gt;Over the target, a burst of <a href="flak" class="uri" title="wikilink">flak</a> knocked out one engine, then the other engine went out. When the order came to bail out, the <a href="Tail_gunner" title="wikilink">tailgunner</a> went out first, and got stuck in the escape hatch, pinned against the rear of it by the wind pressure. Chappuis kicked him in the only accessible place&lt;U+2014&gt;his head &lt;U+2013&gt; and knocked him loose. Then he jumped.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

The German headquarters was two houses away, and the drill grounds were across the street. Accordingly, Chappuis and the other Americans could not walk near a window or talk above a whisper.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> They passed the time playing cards with each other and with the Ugolini family with whom they stayed, and reading a well-worn copy of <em><a href="Uncle_Tom&#39;s_Cabin" title="wikilink">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a></em>. The Americans were nearly captured one evening when the <a href="Italian_fascism" title="wikilink">Fascist</a> fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt; of one of the Ugolini daughters entered the house unannounced and found the Americans playing cards. He threatened to turn the American in, but was persuaded not to when told it would mean the death of his fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt;e and her family for aiding the Americans.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>When <a href="V-E_Day" title="wikilink">V-E Day</a> arrived in early May 1945, Chappuis and his crewmates stayed in Asola for a week-long celebration. On the night the war ended, residents of Asola removed the seats from the town&lt;U+2019&gt;s theater for a victory ball. While two orchestras played onstage, the liberated townspeople toasted the Americans, and Chappuis danced with the Ugolinis' daughters.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> When Chappuis returned to the United States, he stayed in touch with the Ugolinis and sent them weekly food packages.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Chappuis also stayed in touch with Comucci, the resistance leader who rescued him.

<p>Chappuis returned to Michigan after being discharged from the military and played football in the spring of 1946. He returned in time to join the Michigan <a href="baseball" class="uri" title="wikilink">baseball</a> team, where he played in the <a href="outfielder" title="wikilink">outfield</a>, led the team in <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">batting</a>, and helped them win the Big Nine championship with a 26-game winning streak.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>When football season arrived in the fall, Chappuis was one of many veterans who returned to college and the <a href="Gridiron_football" title="wikilink">gridiron</a> after serving in the war. Many of the returning veterans were not in prime football condition at the start of the 1946 season, and Coach <a href="Fritz_Crisler" title="wikilink">Fritz Crisler</a> &lt;U+201C&gt;predicted it might be November before ex-servicemen were adjusted physically and mentally to play their top game.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Chappuis later recalled that he was 23 years old when he returned to school, and some of the returning veterans &lt;U+201C&gt;didn't know if they could get back into the rah-rah of college football, but Fritz took care of that. He really whipped us into shape.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Despite any difficulties in re-adjusting to civilian life and football, Chappuis had a tremendous football season in 1946. He broke <a href="Otto_Graham" title="wikilink">Otto Graham</a>'s <a href="Big_Ten_Conference" title="wikilink">Big Nine Conference</a> record for total offensive yards.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Though reports differ as to Chappuis' total yards gained, <a href="University_of_Michigan" title="wikilink">University of Michigan</a> records show that Chappuis gained 1,284 yards in 1946 &lt;U+2013&gt; 734 yards passing, 501 yards rushing and 49 yards receiving.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Chappuis set the new offensive mark in 1946 with a fractured bone in his <a href="wrist" class="uri" title="wikilink">wrist</a> that he did not report until after the season had ended, at which time an operation was performed.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Chappuis later said he knew the <a href="x-ray" class="uri" title="wikilink">x-ray</a> would reveal a fracture, and he would be benched before he even began.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> He delayed the examination until the season was over because &lt;U+201C&gt;the time to break into the lineup is prior to the first game.

<p><img src="TheBigHouse.jpg" title="fig:Chappuis had a record-setting farewell to Michigan Stadium." alt="Chappuis had a record-setting farewell to Michigan Stadium." width="200" /> Given the off-season wrist surgery, Chappuis was questionable for the 1947 season. As the season got underway, Chappuis said the wrist was &lt;U+201C&gt;not as loose&lt;U+201D&gt; as it was in 1946, but he felt it was &quot;loose enough.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> In the end, Chappuis broke his own Big Nine total offense record by gaining 1,405 yards as compared with 1,284 yards in 1946.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> He completed 48 out of 84 passes for 976 yards, including 11 touchdown passes.

In his last game at <a href="Michigan_Stadium" title="wikilink">Michigan Stadium</a>, Chappuis set a Michigan single-game record for total offense that would last 20 years. Altogether, Chappuis accounted for 307 yards, <a href="Rush_(American_football)" title="wikilink">rushing</a> for 90 yards and completing 12 of 27 passes for 217 yards.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> At the end of the 1947 season, Chappuis was named a unanimous first-team <a href="College_Football_All-America_Team" title="wikilink">All-American</a>.

<p>In addition to having the most accomplished season of his collegiate career, Chappuis was a leader on campus.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> He was elected president of the Michigan Alpha chapter of the <a href="Phi_Delta_Theta" title="wikilink">Phi Delta Theta</a> fraternity whose membership included a number of his teammates and prominent University of Michigan athletic alumni such as <a href="Tom_Harmon" title="wikilink">Tom Harmon</a>, <a href="Bob_Ufer" title="wikilink">Bob Ufer</a>, and <a href="Harry_G._Kipke" title="wikilink">Harry G.

<h3 id="passing-u201cspecialistu201d">Passing &lt;U+201C&gt;specialist&lt;U+201D&gt;</h3>
<p>Chappuis drew considerable attention in the national press for his abilities as a passer, one of the game's first passing &lt;U+201C&gt;specialists.&lt;U+201D&gt; In November 1947, <em><a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Time</a></em> magazine ran a feature article about Chappuis and the 1947 Wolverines (with Chappuis' photograph on the cover) called &lt;U+201C&gt;The Specialist.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The <em>Time</em> article focused on the new era of specialization marked by coach <a href="Fritz_Crisler" title="wikilink">Fritz Crisler</a>'s decision to field separate offensive and defensive units in 1947. The article focused on Chappuis as Michigan's &lt;U+201C&gt;prize specialist,&lt;U+201D&gt; who was described as &lt;U+201C&gt;Crisler's triggerman.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> &lt;U+201C&gt;His job is to throw forward passes and there is no one in 1947 collegiate football who does it better. . . . In Michigan's first five games, Specialist Chappuis was on the field less than one-third of the time, but of the 27 passes he threw, 19 were complete &lt;U+2013&gt; five of them for touchdowns. . . . When Chappuis fades back to pass, he is a slow-motion study in coolness and concentration.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Crisler said Chappuis was &lt;U+201C&gt;the finest passer I have ever handled and probably one of the best I've ever seen. He plays as though he had ice water in his veins.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Crisler felt that &lt;U+201C&gt;great passers are born,&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> and the difference between a great and a merely good passer is in the eyes. <em>Time</em> noted that Chappuis had the ability to spot his receivers tearing downfield and defenders rushing in to nail him &lt;U+201C&gt;in one panoramic glance.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> &lt;U+201C&gt;Like a good baseball catcher, he throws the ball off his right ear, with a snap motion. He throws what the coaches call a &lt;U+2018&gt;heavy ball.&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Another writer noted that Chappuis was &lt;U+201C&gt;endowed with a passer's sixth sense, &lt;U+2018&gt;split vision,&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> and an ability to &lt;U+201C&gt;pick out his receiver after one glance over the field.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Time</em> also noted that Chappuis was unlike his predecessor, the &lt;U+201C&gt;hail-fellow&lt;U+201D&gt; <a href="Tom_Harmon" title="wikilink">Tom Harmon</a>. &lt;U+201C&gt;His snaggleteeth and sharp features earned him the nickname &lt;U+2018&gt;Bird Face&lt;U+2019&gt; when he was a kid.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> <em>Time</em> also reported that Chappuis &lt;U+201C&gt;learns easily, just as he does in the classroom, where he makes a C-plus average seemingly without ever opening a book.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>When Chappuis graduated, he held numerous school records, including most touchdown passes in a career with 23, a record that was not broken until 30 years later by four-year starter, <a href="Rick_Leach" title="wikilink">Rick Leach</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> He also held the record for most touchdown passes in a season with 13, a record that was tied by Leach in 1976.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> He also held the school record for most career total offensive yards with 3,487, a record broken in 1970 by <a href="Don_Moorhead" title="wikilink">Don Moorhead</a>.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
