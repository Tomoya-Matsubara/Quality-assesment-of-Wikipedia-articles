<p><strong>Jack the Ripper</strong> is a <a href="pseudonym" class="uri" title="wikilink">pseudonym</a> given to an unidentified <a href="serial_killer" title="wikilink">serial killer</a> active in the largely impoverished districts in and around <a href="Whitechapel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Whitechapel</a>, <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, in late 1888. The name originated in <a href="Dear_Boss_letter" title="wikilink">a letter</a> by someone claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media. The letter is widely considered to be a hoax, and may have been written by a journalist in a deliberate attempt to heighten interest in the story.</p>
<p>Attacks ascribed to the Ripper typically involve women <a href="prostitution" title="wikilink">prostitutes</a> whose throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations. The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer possessed anatomical or surgical knowledge. Rumours that the murders were connected intensified in September and October 1888, and media outlets and <a href="Scotland_Yard" title="wikilink">Scotland Yard</a> received a series of extremely disturbing letters from a writer or writers purporting to be the murderer. <a href="From_Hell_letter" title="wikilink">One letter</a>, received by <a href="George_Lusk" title="wikilink">George Lusk</a>, of the <a href="Whitechapel_Vigilance_Committee" title="wikilink">Whitechapel Vigilance Committee</a>, included half of a preserved human kidney, supposedly from one of the victims. Mainly because of the extraordinarily brutal character of the murders, and because of media treatment of the events, the public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer, Jack the Ripper. Extensive newspaper coverage bestowed widespread and enduring international notoriety on the Ripper. The murders most often attributed to the Ripper occurred in the latter half of 1888, although a longer series of brutal <a href="Whitechapel_murders" title="wikilink">killings in Whitechapel</a> persisted at least until 1891. The investigation was unable to connect the later killings conclusively to the murders of 1888, but the legend of Jack the Ripper solidified.</p>
<p>The term &quot;ripperology&quot; was coined to describe the study and analysis of the Ripper cases. As the murders were never solved, the legends surrounding them became a combination of genuine historical research, <a href="folklore" class="uri" title="wikilink">folklore</a>, and <a href="pseudohistory" class="uri" title="wikilink">pseudohistory</a>. There are over one hundred <a href="Jack_the_Ripper_suspects" title="wikilink">theories about the Ripper's identity</a>, and the murders have inspired <a href="Jack_the_Ripper_fiction" title="wikilink">multiple works of fiction</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In the mid 19th century, England experienced an influx of <a href="Irish_diaspora" title="wikilink">Irish immigrants</a>, who swelled the populations of England's major cities, including the <a href="East_End_of_London" title="wikilink">East End of London</a>. From 1882, <a href="Jew" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> refugees from eastern Europe and <a href="Tsarist_Russia" title="wikilink">Tsarist Russia</a> moved into the same area.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> London's East End, and the <a href="civil_parish" title="wikilink">civil parish</a> of <a href="Whitechapel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Whitechapel</a> became increasingly overcrowded, work and housing conditions worsened, and a massive economic underclass developed.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Robbery, violence and alcohol dependency were commonplace, and the endemic poverty drove many women to <a href="prostitution" class="uri" title="wikilink">prostitution</a>. In October 1888, the <a href="London_Metropolitan_Police" title="wikilink">London Metropolitan Police</a> estimated that there were 1200 prostitutes and about 62 brothels in Whitechapel.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The economic problems were accompanied by a steady rise in social tensions. Between 1886 and 1889, frequent demonstrations, <a href="Bloody_Sunday_(1887)" title="wikilink">such as that of 13 November 1887</a>, led to police intervention and further public unrest.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Racism, crime, social disturbance, and real deprivation fed public perceptions that Whitechapel was a notorious den of immorality.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In 1888, such perceptions were strengthened when a series of vicious and grotesque murders attributed to &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; received unprecedented coverage in the media.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>The first two cases in the Whitechapel murders file, those of <a href="Emma_Elizabeth_Smith" title="wikilink">Emma Elizabeth Smith</a> and <a href="Martha_Tabram" title="wikilink">Martha Tabram</a>, are non-canonical. Smith was robbed and sexually assaulted on <a href="Osborn_Street" title="wikilink">Osborn Street</a>, Whitechapel, on 3 April 1888. A blunt object was inserted into her <a href="vagina" class="uri" title="wikilink">vagina</a>, which ruptured her <a href="peritoneum" class="uri" title="wikilink">peritoneum</a>. She developed <a href="peritonitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">peritonitis</a>, and died the following day at <a href="London_Hospital" title="wikilink">London Hospital</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> She said that she had been attacked by two or three men, one of whom was a teenager.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Although this attack was linked to the later murders by the press,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> it was almost certainly gang violence unrelated to the Ripper.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Tabram was killed on 7 August 1888; she had suffered 39 stab wounds. The savagery of the murder, the lack of obvious motive, and the closeness of the location (George Yard, Whitechapel) and date to those of the later Ripper murders led police to link them.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> However, the attack differs from the canonical ones in that Tabram was stabbed rather than slashed at the throat and abdomen. Many experts today do not connect it with the later murders because of the difference in the wound pattern.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="canonical-five">Canonical five</h3>
<p>The canonical five Ripper victims are <a href="Mary_Ann_Nichols" title="wikilink">Mary Ann Nichols</a>, <a href="Annie_Chapman" title="wikilink">Annie Chapman</a>, <a href="Elizabeth_Stride" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Stride</a>, <a href="Catherine_Eddowes" title="wikilink">Catherine Eddowes</a> and <a href="Mary_Jane_Kelly" title="wikilink">Mary Jane Kelly</a>. Nichols' body was discovered at about 3:40 a.m. on Friday 31 August 1888 in <a href="Buck&#39;s_Row" title="wikilink">Buck's Row</a> (now <a href="Durward_Street" title="wikilink">Durward Street</a>), Whitechapel. The throat was severed deeply by two cuts, and the lower part of the abdomen was partly ripped open by a deep, jagged wound. Several other incisions on the abdomen were caused by the same knife.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Chapman's body was discovered at about 6 a.m. on Saturday 8 September 1888 near a doorway in the back yard of 29 <a href="Hanbury_Street" title="wikilink">Hanbury Street</a>, <a href="Spitalfields" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spitalfields</a>. As in the case of Mary Ann Nichols, the throat was severed by two cuts.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The abdomen was slashed entirely open, and it was later discovered that the <a href="uterus" class="uri" title="wikilink">uterus</a> had been removed.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> At the inquest, one witness described seeing Chapman with a dark-haired man of &quot;shabby-genteel&quot; appearance at about 5:30 a.m.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Stride and Eddowes were killed on Sunday 30 September 1888. Stride's body was discovered at about 1 a.m., in Dutfield's Yard, off Berner Street (now <a href="Henriques_Street" title="wikilink">Henriques Street</a>) in Whitechapel. The cause of death was one clear-cut incision which severed the main artery on the left side of the neck. Uncertainty about whether Stride's murder should be attributed to the Ripper, or whether he was interrupted during the attack, stems from the absence of mutilations to the abdomen.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Witnesses who thought they saw Stride with a man earlier that night gave differing descriptions: some said her companion was fair, others dark; some said he was shabbily-dressed, others well-dressed.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Eddowes' body was found in <a href="Mitre_Square" title="wikilink">Mitre Square</a>, in the <a href="City_of_London" title="wikilink">City of London</a>, three-quarters of an hour after Stride's. The throat was severed, and the abdomen was ripped open by a long, deep, jagged wound. The left kidney and the major part of the uterus had been removed. A local man, <a href="Joseph_Lawende" title="wikilink">Joseph Lawende</a>, had passed through the square shortly before the murder with two friends, and he described seeing a fair-haired man of shabby appearance with a woman who may have been Eddowes.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> His companions, however, were unable to confirm his description.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Eddowes' and Stride's murders were later called the &quot;double event&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Part of Eddowes' bloodied apron was found at the entrance to a tenement in Goulston Street, Whitechapel. Some writing on the wall above the apron piece, which became known as the <a href="Goulston_Street_graffito" title="wikilink">Goulston Street graffito</a>, seemed to implicate a Jew or Jews, but it was unclear whether the graffito was written by the murderer as he dropped the apron piece, or merely incidental.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> <a href="Commissioner_of_Police_of_the_Metropolis" title="wikilink">Police Commissioner</a> <a href="Charles_Warren" title="wikilink">Charles Warren</a> feared the graffito might spark <a href="Antisemitism" title="wikilink">antisemitic</a> riots, and ordered it washed away before dawn.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> <img src="MaryJaneKelly_Ripper_100.jpg" title="fig:Official police photograph of Mary Kelly&#39;s murder scene in 13 Miller&#39;s Court." alt="Official police photograph of Mary Kelly&#39;s murder scene in 13 Miller&#39;s Court." /> Kelly's gruesomely mutilated body was discovered lying on the bed in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, off <a href="Dorset_Street,_London" title="wikilink">Dorset Street, Spitalfields</a>, shortly after 10:45 a.m. on Friday 9 November 1888. The throat had been severed down to the spine, and the abdomen virtually emptied of its organs. The heart was missing.</p>
<p>The canonical five murders were perpetrated at night, on or close to a weekend, and either at the end of a month or a week or so after.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded, except for that of Stride, whose attacker may have been interrupted.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Nichols was not missing any organs; Chapman's uterus was taken; Eddowes had her uterus and a kidney removed and her face mutilated; Kelly's body was eviscerated and her face hacked away, though only her heart was missing from the crime scene.</p>
<p>Historically, the belief that these five crimes were committed by the same man derives from contemporary documents that link them together to the exclusion of others.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In 1894, Sir <a href="Melville_Macnaghten" title="wikilink">Melville Macnaghten</a>, Assistant <a href="Chief_Constable" title="wikilink">Chief Constable</a> of the <a href="Metropolitan_Police_Service" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Police Service</a> and Head of the <a href="Criminal_Investigation_Department" title="wikilink">Criminal Investigation Department</a> (CID), wrote a report that stated: &quot;the Whitechapel murderer had 5 victims&lt;U+2014&gt;&amp; 5 victims only&quot;.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Similarly, the canonical five victims were linked together in a letter written by the police surgeon <a href="Thomas_Bond_(British_physician)" title="wikilink">Thomas Bond</a> to <a href="Robert_Anderson_(police_official)" title="wikilink">Robert Anderson</a>, head of the London CID, on 10 November 1888.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> While the police evidently treated the five murders as a single case, authors Stewart P. Evans and <a href="Donald_Rumbelow" title="wikilink">Donald Rumbelow</a> argue that the canonical five is a &quot;Ripper myth&quot; and that while three cases (Nichols, Chapman, and Eddowes) can be definitely linked, there is less certainty over Stride and Kelly, and less again over Tabram.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Dr Percy Clark, assistant to the examining pathologist <a href="George_Bagster_Phillips" title="wikilink">George Bagster Phillips</a>, linked only three of the murders and thought the others were perpetrated by &quot;weak-minded individual[s] ... induced to emulate the crime&quot;.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Macnaghten did not join the police force until the year after the murders, and his memorandum contains serious factual errors about possible suspects.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Some researchers have posited that the series may not have been the work of a single murderer at all, but of an unknown larger number of killers acting independently.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Conversely, others suppose that the six murders between Tabram and Kelly were the work of a single killer.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="later-whitechapel-murders">Later Whitechapel murders</h3>
<p>Kelly is generally considered to be the Ripper's final victim, and it is assumed that the crimes ended because of the culprit's death, imprisonment, institutionalisation, or emigration.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The Whitechapel murders file does, however, detail another four murders that happened after the canonical five, those of Rose Mylett, Alice McKenzie, The Pinchin Street torso, and Frances Coles.</p>
<p>Mylett was found strangled in Clarke's Yard, High Street, <a href="Poplar,_London" title="wikilink">Poplar</a> on 20 December 1888. As there was no sign of a struggle, the police believed that she had accidentally choked herself while in a drunken stupor, or committed suicide.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Nevertheless, the inquest jury returned a verdict of murder.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>McKenzie was killed on 17 July 1889 by severance of the left carotid artery. Several minor bruises and cuts were found on the body, discovered in Castle Alley, Whitechapel. One of the examining pathologists, <a href="Thomas_Bond_(British_physician)" title="wikilink">Thomas Bond</a>, believed this to be a Ripper murder, though another pathologist, <a href="George_Bagster_Phillips" title="wikilink">George Bagster Phillips</a>, who had examined the bodies of three previous victims, disagreed.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Later writers are also divided between those who think that her murderer copied the Ripper's <em>modus operandi</em> to deflect suspicion from himself,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> and those that ascribe it to the Ripper.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;The Pinchin Street torso&quot; was a headless and legless torso of an unidentified woman found under a railway arch in Pinchin Street, Whitechapel, on 10 September 1889. It seems probable that the murder was committed elsewhere and that parts of the dismembered body were dumped at the crime scene.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Coles was killed on 13 February 1891 under a railway arch at Swallow Gardens, Whitechapel. Her throat was cut but the body was not mutilated. A man named <a href="Jack_the_Ripper_suspects#James_Thomas_Sadler" title="wikilink">James Thomas Sadler</a>, seen earlier with her, was arrested by the police, charged with her murder and was briefly thought to be the Ripper.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> He was, however, later discharged from court due to lack of evidence on 3 March 1891.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

<p>In addition to the eleven Whitechapel murders, other contemporary attacks have been connected to the Ripper by commentators. In some cases, it is unclear whether these stories were true or whether they were fabricated as a part of Ripper lore.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> &quot;Fairy Fay&quot; was a nickname for an unknown murder victim allegedly found on 26 December 1887 &quot;after a stake had been thrust through her abdomen&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> It has been suggested that &quot;Fairy Fay&quot; was a creation of the press based upon confusion of the details of the murder of Emma Elizabeth Smith with a separate non-fatal attack the previous Christmas.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The name of &quot;Fairy Fay&quot; was first used for this alleged victim in 1950.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> There were no recorded murders in Whitechapel at or around Christmas 1887.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Most authors agree that &quot;Fairy Fay&quot; never existed.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

In the 1920s and 1930s, he was depicted in film dressed in everyday clothes as a man with a hidden secret preying on his unsuspecting victims; atmosphere and evil were suggested through lighting effects and shadowplay.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> By the 1960s, the Ripper had become &quot;the symbol of a predatory aristocracy&quot;,<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> and was portrayed in a top hat dressed as a gentleman. <a href="The_Establishment" title="wikilink">The Establishment</a> as a whole became the villain with the Ripper acting as a manifestation of upper-class exploitation.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> The image of the Ripper merged or borrowed symbols from horror stories, such as <a href="Dracula" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dracula</a>'s cloak or <a href="Victor_Frankenstein" title="wikilink">Victor Frankenstein</a>'s organ harvest.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> The fictional world of the Ripper can fuse with multiple genres, ranging from <a href="Sherlock_Holmes" title="wikilink">Sherlock Holmes</a> to <a href="Assault!_Jack_the_Ripper" title="wikilink">Japanese erotic horror</a>.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>
<p>Unlike murderers of lesser fame, there is no waxwork figure of Jack the Ripper at <a href="Madame_Tussauds" title="wikilink">Madame Tussauds</a>' Chamber of Horrors, in accordance with their policy of not modelling persons whose likeness is unknown.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> He is instead depicted as a shadow.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> In 2006, Jack the Ripper was selected by <a href="BBC_History_(magazine)" title="wikilink"><em>BBC History</em> magazine</a> and its readers as the <a href="Worst_Britons_(BBC_History_poll)" title="wikilink">worst Briton in history</a>.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a><a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a></p>
