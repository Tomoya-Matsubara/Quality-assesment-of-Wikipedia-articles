<p><strong>Walter Oswald Watt</strong> <a href="Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">OBE</a> (11 February 1878 – 21 May 1921) was an Australian aviator and businessman. The son of a Scottish-Australian merchant and politician, he was born in England and came to <a href="Sydney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sydney</a> when he was a year old. He returned to Britain at the age of eleven for education at <a href="Bristol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bristol</a> and <a href="Cambridge" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cambridge</a>. In 1900 he went back to Australia and enlisted in the <a href="Australian_Army_Reserve" title="wikilink">Militia</a>, before acquiring cattle <a href="Station_(Australian_agriculture)" title="wikilink">stations</a> in <a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a> and <a href="Queensland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queensland</a>. He was also a partner in the family shipping firm.</p>
<p>Becoming in 1911 the first Australian to qualify for his <a href="Royal_Aero_Club" title="wikilink">Royal Aero Club</a> flying certificate, Watt joined the <a href="French_Foreign_Legion" title="wikilink">French Foreign Legion</a> as a pilot on the outbreak of World War I. He transferred to the <a href="Australian_Flying_Corps" title="wikilink">Australian Flying Corps</a> (AFC) in 1916, quickly progressing from a <a href="Flight_(military_unit)" title="wikilink">flight commander</a> with <a href="No._1_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 1 Squadron</a> in Egypt to the <a href="commanding_officer" title="wikilink">commanding officer</a> of <a href="No._2_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 2 Squadron</a> on the <a href="Western_Front_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">Western Front</a>. By February 1918, he had been promoted to <a href="lieutenant_colonel" title="wikilink">lieutenant colonel</a> and taken command of the AFC's <a href="No._1_Wing_RAAF" title="wikilink">1st Training Wing</a> in England.</p>
<p>A recipient of France's <a href="Legion_of_Honour" title="wikilink">Legion of Honour</a> and <a href="Croix_de_guerre_1914&lt;U+2013&gt;1918_(France)" title="wikilink">Croix de Guerre</a>, and twice <a href="mentioned_in_despatches" title="wikilink">mentioned in despatches</a> during the war, Watt was appointed an <a href="Officer_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> in 1919. He left the military to pursue business interests in Australia, and was lauded for his generosity to other returned airmen. In 1921, at the age of forty-three, he died by accidental drowning at <a href="Bilgola,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Bilgola Beach</a>, New South Wales. He is commemorated by the <a href="Oswald_Watt_Gold_Medal" title="wikilink">Oswald Watt Gold Medal</a> for outstanding achievement in Australian aviation, and the Oswald Watt Fund at the <a href="University_of_Sydney" title="wikilink">University of Sydney</a>.</p>

<p>Born on 11 February 1878 in <a href="Bournemouth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bournemouth</a>, England, Oswald Watt was the youngest son of John Brown Watt, a Scot who had migrated to <a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a> in 1842 and became a successful merchant and politician, frequently representing his state on overseas missions.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Oswald's Australian-born mother, Mary Jane, died when he was one and shortly afterwards the family relocated to <a href="Sydney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sydney</a>. Oswald was sent back to England at the age of eleven to complete his schooling at <a href="Clifton_College" title="wikilink">Clifton College</a>, <a href="Bristol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bristol</a>, before going on to study at <a href="Trinity_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, where he received a <a href="Bachelor_of_Arts" title="wikilink">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in 1899. Returning to Sydney in 1900, he was commissioned as a <a href="second_lieutenant" title="wikilink">second lieutenant</a> in the <a href="New_South_Wales_Scottish_Regiment" title="wikilink">New South Wales Scottish Rifles</a>, a <a href="Australian_Army_Reserve" title="wikilink">Militia</a> unit, and in 1902 was appointed an <a href="aide-de-camp" class="uri" title="wikilink">aide-de-camp</a> to the <a href="Governor_of_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Governor of New South Wales</a>.

This gesture was welcomed and he joined the Aviation Militaire section of the <a href="French_Foreign_Legion" title="wikilink">Foreign Legion</a> as a pilot. Though he was ranked an ordinary soldier, his colleagues in Bleriot Squadron No. 30 referred to him as &quot;<em>Capitaine</em>&quot; in deference to his previous status in the Australian Militia.
