<p>The <strong>Mets&lt;U+2013&gt;Yankees rivalry</strong> is the latest incarnation of the <a href="Subway_Series" title="wikilink">Subway Series</a>, the competition between New York City's <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> teams, the <a href="American_League" title="wikilink">American League</a> <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a> and <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> <a href="New_York_Mets" title="wikilink">New York Mets</a>. Until <a href="Interleague_play" title="wikilink">Interleague play</a> started, the two teams had only met in exhibition games. Since the inception of interleague play the two teams have met every regular season since 1997, and since 1999 they have met six times each season, playing two three-game series, one in each team's ballpark. They have made the postseason in the same year three times: , , and , and faced off in the <a href="2000_World_Series" title="wikilink">2000 World Series</a>.

<h3 id="background-and-formation-of-mets">Background and formation of Mets</h3>
<p>The Mets&lt;U+2013&gt;Yankees rivalry has its origins in the histories of the <a href="History_of_the_Brooklyn_Dodgers" title="wikilink">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>, <a href="History_of_the_New_York_Giants_(NL)" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a>, and <a href="History_of_the_New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">Yankees</a>, the three <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> teams of New York City from 1903&lt;U+2013&gt;57.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> For most of that time, the Giants played in <a href="Manhattan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a>, the Dodgers in <a href="Brooklyn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brooklyn</a>, and the Yankees in the <a href="Bronx" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bronx</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout their time in New York, the three teams chronicled a fierce intra-city rivalry. The <a href="Dodgers&lt;U+2013&gt;Giants_rivalry" title="wikilink">Dodgers&lt;U+2013&gt;Giants rivalry</a> was formed by both teams' competition for dominance in the <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a>, exemplified by <a href="Bobby_Thomson" title="wikilink">Bobby Thomson</a>'s <a href="Shot_Heard_&#39;Round_the_World_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Shot Heard 'Round the World</a> in the <a href="1951_National_League_tie-breaker_series" title="wikilink">1951 National League tie-breaker series</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The Yankees, as the city's only <a href="American_League" title="wikilink">American League</a> team, would form the <a href="Giants&lt;U+2013&gt;Yankees_rivalry" title="wikilink">Giants&lt;U+2013&gt;Yankees rivalry</a> and <a href="Dodgers&lt;U+2013&gt;Yankees_rivalry" title="wikilink">Dodgers&lt;U+2013&gt;Yankees rivalry</a> around their multiple <a href="Subway_Series" title="wikilink">Subway Series</a> competitions with the two teams, where the Yankees would compile a 10-3 record in the thirteen all-New York <a href="World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>However, in , both of New York's National League teams moved to <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>, the Giants to San Francisco to become the <a href="San_Francisco_Giants" title="wikilink">San Francisco Giants</a>, and the Dodgers to <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> to become the <a href="Los_Angeles_Dodgers" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>. The Yankees were New York City's only Major League Baseball team until , when the expansion Mets joined the National League. The Mets sought to create a fan base from fans of the departed National League teams, and adopted the Giants' NY insignia in the Giant color of orange set against a cap of Dodger blue. They played their first two seasons in the Giants' old stadium, the <a href="Polo_Grounds" title="wikilink">Polo Grounds</a>, before moving into <a href="Shea_Stadium" title="wikilink">Shea Stadium</a> in the borough of <a href="Queens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queens</a>.</p>
<p>It was announced that both teams would compete for the &quot;Mayor's Trophy&quot; in exhibition games between the two until the series was cancelled in the 1980s.</p>

<p><a href="1962_Major_League_Baseball_season" title="wikilink">1962</a> was the inaugural season of the New York Mets and they would post one of the worst regular season records in MLB history, 40-120.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Meanwhile, the Yankees won the <a href="1962_World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a> that year, the last such World Series won by the aging lineup of the 1950s dynasty. The Yankees would go to the World Series in  and , but lose both times. The 1962 and 1963 World Series were played against the Yankees' former <a href="Subway_Series" title="wikilink">Subway Series</a> rivals, the Giants in '62 and Dodgers in '63.</p>
<p>The Mets hired former Yankee legend <a href="Casey_Stengel" title="wikilink">Casey Stengel</a> as their first manager and former Yankee legend and Hall of Famer <a href="Red_Ruffing" title="wikilink">Red Ruffing</a> as their first pitching coach. Stengel's number 37 serves as the only number retired by both the Yankees and Mets. The Mets emerged as one of the worst teams in baseball for their first seven seasons. In 1966, the Mets bypassed Hall of Famer and future Yankee <a href="Reggie_Jackson" title="wikilink">Reggie Jackson</a> in the amateur draft, instead selecting <a href="Steve_Chilcott" title="wikilink">Steve Chilcott</a>, who never played in the majors. However, behind pitching ace <a href="Tom_Seaver" title="wikilink">Tom Seaver</a>, the <a href="1969_New_York_Mets_season" title="wikilink">1969 &quot;Miracle Mets&quot;</a> staged a remarkable turnaround for the franchise and defeated the heavily-favored <a href="1969_Baltimore_Orioles_season" title="wikilink">Baltimore Orioles</a> in the <a href="1969_World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a>.</p>
<p>The Mets staged a surprising late season run to capture the <a href="1973_National_League_Championship_Series" title="wikilink">1973 National League Pennant</a>, but lost the <a href="1973_World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a> in seven games to the <a href="Oakland_Athletics" title="wikilink">Oakland Athletics</a>, particularly due to the efforts in Game 7 of Reggie Jackson. The Mets winning this National League pennant was the only <a href="National_League_East" title="wikilink">NL East</a> title between 1970 and 1980 that wasn't won by either <a href="Mets&lt;U+2013&gt;Phillies_rivalry" title="wikilink">rival</a> <a href="Phillies&lt;U+2013&gt;Pirates_rivalry" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Phillies or the Pittsburgh Pirates</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Former Yankee catcher <a href="Yogi_Berra" title="wikilink">Yogi Berra</a> was a Met coach in 1969 and manager of the team in 1973. Both teams shared <a href="Shea_Stadium" title="wikilink">Shea Stadium</a> as their home field when <a href="Yankee_Stadium_(1923)" title="wikilink">Yankee Stadium</a> was being refit during the  and  seasons.</p>
<p>The Yankees returned to the World Series in , but were swept by the <a href="Big_Red_Machine" title="wikilink">Big Red Machine</a> of the <a href="Cincinnati_Reds" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Reds</a>. This caused Yankees owner <a href="George_Steinbrenner" title="wikilink">George Steinbrenner</a> to acquire the top free agent for the , Reggie Jackson. Jackson helped the Yankees won their first World Series in 15 years against former <a href="Subway_Series" title="wikilink">Subway Series</a> <a href="Yankees&lt;U+2013&gt;Dodgers_rivalry" title="wikilink">rival</a> <a href="Los_Angeles_Dodgers" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>, where Jackson earned the moniker &quot;Mr. October&quot; by hitting three home runs off of three different Dodger pitchers, all on the first pitch, in Game 6. That year, future Yankees manager <a href="Joe_Torre" title="wikilink">Joe Torre</a> made his managerial debut with the Mets. The following year, the Yankees again defeated the Dodgers in six games in the <a href="1978_World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a>.</p>
<p>The Yankees again faced the Dodgers in the <a href="1981_World_Series" title="wikilink">1981 World Series</a>, but lost in six games in the same way the Dodgers lost the 1978 series (winning the first two games at home, but dropping the next four). This began another long championship drought for the Yankees, 18 years, the longest since they first won in . The 1980s would also be the only decade since their first championship in which they did not win a World Series.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In contrast, the Mets enjoyed success during much of the decade and won the World Series in  against the Yankees' <a href="Yankees_&lt;U+2013&gt;_Red_Sox_rivalry" title="wikilink">biggest nemesis</a>, the <a href="Boston_Red_Sox" title="wikilink">Boston Red Sox</a>, in seven games. <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> called the series a &quot;painful series.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> <em><a href="Newsday" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newsday</a></em> called it &quot;woeful days for Yankee fans.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <a href="Mike_Lupica" title="wikilink">Mike Lupica</a> of the <em><a href="Daily_News_(New_York)" title="wikilink">New York Daily News</a></em> called the series &quot;the World Series that is the Yankee nightmare.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Both <em><a href="Newsday" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newsday</a></em> and <em>The Boston Globe</em> said that there were Mets T-shirts saying &quot;<a href="George_Steinbrenner" title="wikilink">Steinbrenner</a>'s nightmare,&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> referring to Yankees owner <a href="George_Steinbrenner" title="wikilink">George Steinbrenner</a>.

<p>During the  season, former Met legend <a href="Tom_Seaver" title="wikilink">Tom Seaver</a> had been acquired by the <a href="Chicago_White_Sox" title="wikilink">Chicago White Sox</a> due to the Mets taking a chance and not protecting his contract after the  season.

<h3 id="u20131998-first-official-games">1997&lt;U+2013&gt;1998: First official games</h3>
<p>In , Major League Baseball scheduled official regular season games between the American and National Leagues for the first time. On June 16, the Mets and Yankees played their first official game at Yankee Stadium, which the Mets won 6&lt;U+2013&gt;0 behind <a href="Dave_Mlicki" title="wikilink">Dave Mlicki</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The Yankees won the next two games for a series win. The Mets acquired <a href="Mike_Piazza" title="wikilink">Mike Piazza</a> for the 1998 season and made a run for the playoffs, but were eliminated in the last regular game series of the season by the Atlanta Braves. The Yankees won that year's interleague series at Shea Stadium two games to one, and would also win the <a href="1998_World_Series" title="wikilink">1998 World Series</a>, the first of three straight titles for them. David Cone won 20 games in 1998 for the Yankees, just 10 years after he accomplished the same feat for the Mets, becoming the only player to win 20 games for both teams.</p>
<p>These interleague games between the Mets and Yankees would come to be referred to as a <a href="Subway_Series" title="wikilink">Subway Series</a>, extending the use of that phrase outside the historical context of an all-New York World Series.</p>
<h3 id="both-teams-reach-the-playoffs">1999: Both teams reach the playoffs</h3>
<p>In 1999, Major League Baseball expanded Interleague play, allowing the Mets and Yankees to host a series at their home stadiums. At Shea, the Mets won their first series against the Yankees, 2 games to 1, though the regular season series was tied by virtue of a Yankees series win (2 to 1) at Yankee Stadium earlier that year. That year marked the first time both teams reached the playoffs in the same season, though the Mets needed an <a href="1999_National_League_Wild_Card_tie-breaker_game" title="wikilink">extra game</a> for their first playoff appearance since losing the <a href="1988_National_League_Championship_Series" title="wikilink">1988 National League Championship Series</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Both the Mets and Yankees reached their respective League Championship Series and played their respective rivals. The Mets were defeated by their <a href="Braves&lt;U+2013&gt;Mets_rivalry" title="wikilink">division rival</a> <a href="Atlanta_Braves" title="wikilink">Atlanta Braves</a> in <a href="1999_National_League_Championship_Series" title="wikilink">their LCS</a>,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> while the Yankees defeated <a href="Yankees_&lt;U+2013&gt;_Red_Sox_rivalry" title="wikilink">longtime rival</a> <a href="Boston_Red_Sox" title="wikilink">Boston Red Sox</a> in <a href="1999_ALCS" title="wikilink">that year's ALCS</a>.

<h2 id="world-series-meeting">2000: World Series meeting</h2>

<p>During the regular season on July 8, 2000, the Yankees defeated the Mets by identical 4-2 scores in both ends of an unusual day-night doubleheader. With the first game played at <a href="Shea_Stadium" title="wikilink">Shea Stadium</a> and the nightcap at <a href="Yankee_Stadium_(1923)" title="wikilink">Yankee Stadium</a>, it was the first time since <a href="1903_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1903</a> that two teams played two games in different stadiums on the same day. <a href="Dwight_Gooden" title="wikilink">Dwight Gooden</a> won the first game with a six inning effort in his first start since returning to the Yankees. <a href="Roger_Clemens" title="wikilink">Roger Clemens</a> won the nightcap.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> However, in the second game of that double header, an event occurred that made the rivalry between the two teams more contentious. Clemens hit Mets' star <a href="Mike_Piazza" title="wikilink">Mike Piazza</a> in the helmet with an inside fastball, causing Piazza to suffer a <a href="concussion" class="uri" title="wikilink">concussion</a> and placing him on the disabled list.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The Mets and Yankees returned to the playoffs that year and won their respective pennants, meeting in the <a href="2000_World_Series" title="wikilink">2000 World Series</a> for their first championship contest. It was the Yankees' fourth appearance in five years and the Mets' first appearance since winning the title in . It was the first <a href="Subway_Series" title="wikilink">Subway Series</a> World Series since . Game 1 went to extra innings in what was then the longest World Series game of all time, with the Yankees winning on a walk-off hit by former Met <a href="Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Vizca&lt;U+00ED&gt;no" title="wikilink">Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Vizca&lt;U+00ED&gt;no</a>.</p>
<p>Controversy ensued in Game 2 when Yankees pitcher <a href="Roger_Clemens" title="wikilink">Roger Clemens</a> faced Mets catcher <a href="Mike_Piazza" title="wikilink">Mike Piazza</a> for the first time since the hit-by-pitch earlier that season. In the match-up, Piazza shattered his bat after fouling off one of Clemens' pitches, and the splintered bathead hurtled towards the mound. Clemens threw the bathead towards the baseline and nearly hit Piazza who had been running down the foul line. The incident caused both benches to clear. The Yankees won the game 6-5.</p>
<p>The Mets won Game 3, snapping the Yankees' fourteen game winning streak in World Series play dating back to 1996 and Yankee hurler Orlando &quot;El Duque&quot; Hernandez's previously undefeated postseason record (6&lt;U+2013&gt;0). However, this would prove to be the only high point for the Mets. <a href="Derek_Jeter" title="wikilink">Derek Jeter</a> hit a home run on the first pitch of Game 4, immediately shifting momentum back to the Yankees who would win the game. Footage of this home run currently serves as the background for the title screen of YES Network's &quot;<a href="Yankeeography" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yankeeography</a>&quot; series. Despite no game in the series being decided by more than two runs, the Yankees would only require five games to beat the Mets. <a href="Al_Leiter" title="wikilink">Al Leiter</a>, a former Yankee prospect, would take the mound for the Mets in Game 5 and lose. The Yankees clinched their third straight World Series championship when Mariano Rivera got Mike Piazza to pop up for the final out of Game 5.</p>
<p><a href="World_Series_MVP" title="wikilink">World Series MVP</a> Derek Jeter said of the Mets: &quot;In my opinion, the Mets were the toughest team we have played in my five years here. Every one of these games could have gone either way. They could have given up after [losing] the first two games, but they never quit.

<p>This World Series win was sense of revenge for <a href="Roger_Clemens" title="wikilink">Roger Clemens</a>, because he won the World Series in the same stadium he lost it at in 1986 while with the Red Sox.

Mets manager <a href="Bobby_Valentine" title="wikilink">Bobby Valentine</a> chided Clemens by saying he wore a &quot;skirt&quot; when compared to past pitchers who threw hard at people like <a href="Bob_Gibson" title="wikilink">Bob Gibson</a> and <a href="Don_Drysdale" title="wikilink">Don Drysdale</a> because Clemens did not have to bat in the American League. When the game arrived, Clemens was forced to bat and Mets pitcher <a href="Shawn_Estes" title="wikilink">Shawn Estes</a> attempted to hit Clemens in retaliation but instead threw a pitch behind Clemens, prompting the home plate umpire to warn both benches. Estes later homered off of Clemens as the Mets won the game 8-0.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></li>

<li><p>&lt;U+2013&gt; the Yankees become the first and, as of <a href="2011_Major_League_Baseball_season" title="wikilink">2011</a>, only team to sweep the season series, winning all six games, including a two-park day-night doubleheader.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>&lt;U+2013&gt; the Mets win the season series for the first time, going 4&lt;U+2013&gt;2 and sweep the three games at <a href="Shea_Stadium" title="wikilink">Shea Stadium</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In 2005, the Mets signed Manager <a href="Willie_Randolph" title="wikilink">Willie Randolph</a>, who coached with the Yankees for over a decade. Randolph played much of his career with the Yankees and also played for the Mets before retiring as a player. Because of his history with the Yankees championship teams of the 70s (as a player) and the 90s (as a coach), he holds a very cordial relationship with Yankee fans despite his tenure with the Mets organization, as noted by a <a href="Subway_(restaurant)" title="wikilink">Subway</a> (a pun on the restaurant's name and the Subway Series) commercial featuring him and former Yankees manager <a href="Joe_Torre" title="wikilink">Joe Torre</a>, who had managed the Yankees during their most recent dynastic run. Torre had also been associated with the Mets as they were the last team he ever played for and the first team he ever managed. On August 2, 2008, less than two months after his abrupt and controversial dismissal as Mets manager, Randolph was greeted with a <a href="standing_ovation" title="wikilink">standing ovation</a> by the Yankee Stadium crowd when he appeared in a Yankees uniform for the <a href="Old-Timers&#39;_Day" title="wikilink">Old-Timers' Game</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></li>

<li>On June 26, 2005, the Mets won their first series at Yankee Stadium and were three outs from a sweep when <a href="Jason_Giambi" title="wikilink">Jason Giambi</a>'s bases loaded single off of <a href="Braden_Looper" title="wikilink">Braden Looper</a> in the ninth drove home the tying and winning runs for the Yankees, who forced a season series split with the Mets.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></li>

<li>On May 19, 2006, in the first Subway Series of that year at Shea, the Yankees took the lead three times in the first four innings, but the Mets rallied each time against <a href="Randy_Johnson" title="wikilink">Randy Johnson</a> and the game was tied 6-6 going into the bottom of the ninth. With two outs and runners on first and second, David Wright drives home the winning run for the Mets with a single off of Yankees' closer <a href="Mariano_Rivera" title="wikilink">Mariano Rivera</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On May 20, 2006, less than 24 hours after the Mets' comeback win, <a href="Pedro_Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;nez" title="wikilink">Pedro Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;nez</a> and <a href="Duaner_S&lt;U+00E1&gt;nchez" title="wikilink">Duaner S&lt;U+00E1&gt;nchez</a> kept the Yankees scoreless for eight innings while the Mets score four runs off of <a href="Mike_Mussina" title="wikilink">Mike Mussina</a>. In the top of the ninth, however, closer <a href="Billy_Wagner" title="wikilink">Billy Wagner</a>, who pitched a perfect ninth the night before to get the win, gave up four runs to tie the game and force extra innings. In the top of the 11th, <a href="Andy_Phillips" title="wikilink">Andy Phillips</a> singled in the go-ahead run for the Yankees while Mariano Rivera pitched two shutout innings for the win.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></li>

<ul>
<li>History is made at the <a href="2006_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game" title="wikilink">2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game</a> when two positions on both teams are manned by players from teams of the same city. <a href="David_Wright" title="wikilink">David Wright</a> and <a href="Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Reyes_(shortstop)" title="wikilink">Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Reyes</a> started at third base and shortstop respectively for the National League while <a href="Alex_Rodriguez" title="wikilink">Alex Rodriguez</a> and <a href="Derek_Jeter" title="wikilink">Derek Jeter</a> started at the same respective positions for the American League.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Both teams in  finished at the top of their division in the same season for the first time in history. For the Yankees, this was their ninth straight division title, while the Mets won their first division title since <a href="1988_New_York_Mets_season" title="wikilink">1988</a>. Despite sharing baseball's best regular season record (97-65), they would have disappointing postseasons as both lost en route to the two teams that eventually met in that year's <a href="2006_World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a>, the <a href="Detroit_Tigers" title="wikilink">Detroit Tigers</a> and <a href="St._Louis_Cardinals" title="wikilink">St. Louis Cardinals</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The teams' inverse success relationship was highlighted in . On May 29, the Yankees were tied for last place and 14.5 games back of the <a href="Boston_Red_Sox" title="wikilink">Boston Red Sox</a> while the Mets were in first place ahead of the <a href="Atlanta_Braves" title="wikilink">Atlanta Braves</a> by four games, with the lead being as high as seven in mid-September. A late season meltdown led to the Mets being eliminated from playoff contention, losing the NL East title to the <a href="Philadelphia_Phillies" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Phillies</a> on the last day of the season. On the other hand, the Yankees, though unable to finish first in the AL East for the first time since 1997, rebounded from their losing ways and clinched their 13th consecutive playoff berth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>March 24, 2008: In an article written in the <em><a href="New_York_Daily_News" title="wikilink">New York Daily News</a></em>, Alex Rodriguez said how he regretted signing with the <a href="Texas_Rangers_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Texas Rangers</a> (the team the Yankees acquired him from) in the first place and wished he had signed with the Mets rather than Texas. Rodriguez grew up a Met fan and former Met first baseman turned announcer <a href="Keith_Hernandez" title="wikilink">Keith Hernandez</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Rodriguez stated how he listened to his agent <a href="Scott_Boras" title="wikilink">Scott Boras</a> about taking more money instead and did not want to make the same mistake of not being on a team he liked playing for by leaving the Yankees.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></li>

<li>June 27, 2008: In the first game of a two-stadium, day-night doubleheader against the Yankees, <a href="Carlos_Delgado" title="wikilink">Carlos Delgado</a> scores 9 RBIs (including a grand slam) in a 15&lt;U+2013&gt;6 victory for the Mets, setting a team record for most RBIs in a single game and tying the record for most RBIs in a single game by a visiting player at <a href="Yankee_Stadium_(1923)" title="wikilink">Yankee Stadium</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>&lt;U+2013&gt; For just the second time, the Mets win the season series against the Yankees, 4&lt;U+2013&gt;2, including the Mets' only sweep at <a href="Yankee_Stadium_(1923)" title="wikilink">the old Yankee Stadium</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The 2008 season marked the first time since 1993 that both the Yankees and Mets failed to qualify for postseason, the first time for the Yankees since that year and the second straight year where the Mets were eliminated on the last day of the season. It was also the last year both teams played at their old respective ballparks, <a href="Yankee_Stadium_(1923)" title="wikilink">Yankee Stadium</a> and <a href="Shea_Stadium" title="wikilink">Shea Stadium</a>. <a href="Yogi_Berra" title="wikilink">Yogi Berra</a> was present at the closing ceremonies of both stadiums. Both teams finished with the same record (89-73) that year.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-present-new-stadiums">2009 to present: New stadiums</h2>

<p>The  season was the first year that both teams played in their new stadiums, Mets at <a href="Citi_Field" title="wikilink">Citi Field</a> and the Yankees at the new <a href="Yankee_Stadium" title="wikilink">Yankee Stadium</a>. The Yankees took it one step further opened their new stadium with their 27th World Series championship against the <a href="Philadelphia_Phillies" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Phillies</a>, the <a href="2008_World_Series" title="wikilink">defending champions</a>, becoming the first team to inaugurate two stadiums with World Series wins.</p>
<ul>
<li>June 12, 2009: Both teams played each other for the first time at the new Yankee Stadium. The game had several lead changes, including <a href="Mariano_Rivera" title="wikilink">Mariano Rivera</a> giving up the go ahead run to the Mets in the 8th. In the bottom of the 9th, after Derek Jeter stole 2nd base and <a href="Mark_Texiera" title="wikilink">Mark Texiera</a> was intentionally walked, the Mets new closer <a href="Francisco_Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez_(Venezuelan_pitcher)" title="wikilink">Francisco Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez</a> (K-Rod) paired off against Alex Rodriguez (A-Rod). In what seemed a routine pop with two outs, Mets 2nd baseman and three time <a href="Rawlings_Gold_Glove_Award" title="wikilink">gold glove</a> award winner <a href="Luis_Castillo_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Luis Castillo</a> dropped the ball. Texiera wound up scoring the winning run all the way from first on the error. It would prove to be the Yankees' 7th walk off game that season and the first statistical blown save for K-Rod as a Met. After the game, injured Yankees pitcher <a href="Brian_Bruney" title="wikilink">Brian Bruney</a> criticized K-Rod and his animated behavior on the mound to reporters. &quot;[It] couldn't have happened to a better guy on the mound, either&quot;, said Bruney. &quot;He's got a tired act. ... He gets what he deserves, man. I just don't like watching the guy pitch. I think it's embarrassing.&quot; Rodriguez responded, &quot;Instead of sending a message in the paper, next time when he sees me at <a href="Citi_Field" title="wikilink">Citi Field</a>, come up to me and say it. Don't be sending a message to the media. I don't even know who that guy is, somewhere in Double-A and not even pitching one full season.&quot; <a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>June 14, 2009 &lt;U+2013&gt; Francisco Rodriguez confronts Bruney during batting practice and are separated by teammates. The Yankees shutout the Mets 15&lt;U+2013&gt;0 in the biggest blowout in the history of the series, tagging Met ace Johan Santana for nine runs in  innings, the most Santana has ever allowed in his career.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>June 26, 2009 &lt;U+2013&gt; The two teams played each other for the first time at Citi Field. Alex Rodriguez hit his 564th home run, moving past <a href="Reggie_Jackson" title="wikilink">Reggie Jackson</a> into 11th place on the career home run list. The Yankees defeat the Mets 9&lt;U+2013&gt;1 after the Mets had committed three errors that led to four runs in the second inning, the most ever against the Yankees.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>June 28, 2009 &lt;U+2013&gt; Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, who entered the game to face a batter in the 8th inning, bats against Mets closer Francisco Rodriguez at the top of the 9th inning. Rivera drew a walk with the bases loaded, forcing home <a href="Brett_Gardner" title="wikilink">Brett Gardner</a> to earn his first career <a href="RBI" class="uri" title="wikilink">RBI</a>. Rivera would go on to finish the game and earn his 500th career save as the Yankees swept the series at Citi Field.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>May 22, 2010 - The Mets win their first Subway Series game at Citi Field with a 5-3 victory over the Yankees.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>June 20, 2010 - The Yankees earn their 9,500th franchise victory with a 4-0 win over the Mets. <a href="Mark_Texiera" title="wikilink">Mark Texiera</a> provided the only runs of the game with a third inning grand slam off of <a href="Johan_Santana" title="wikilink">Johan Santana</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>January 3, 2011 - The Yankees signed left-handed relief pitcher <a href="Pedro_Feliciano" title="wikilink">Pedro Feliciano</a> away from the Mets. Under the rules of the collective bargaining agreement of the time, the Yankees had to compensate the Mets a draft pick. The Mets would use this draft pick to get pitcher <a href="Michael_Fulmer" title="wikilink">Michael Fulmer</a>. Feliciano would immediately go on the disabled list for the Yankees due to his overuse by the Mets during his career. Setbacks in surgery would prevent him from ever throwing a pitch for the Yankees during the entirety of the two year contract. <a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>July 3, 2011 - The Mets, down to their final strike and on the verge of getting swept at Citi Field by the Yankees for the second time in three years, tie the final game of that year's Subway Series against <a href="Mariano_Rivera" title="wikilink">Mariano Rivera</a> in the bottom of the ninth on an RBI single from <a href="Ronny_Paulino" title="wikilink">Ronny Paulino</a>. In 23 previous save opportunities against the Mets, spanning the regular season and the <a href="2000_World_Series" title="wikilink">2000 World Series</a>, Rivera had converted 22 <a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> (his only previous blown save against the team was on July 10, 1999 <a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a>). The Mets would win in the 10th inning on an RBI single from <a href="Jason_Bay" title="wikilink">Jason Bay</a>, who had been struggling all season, off of former Met pitcher <a href="Luis_Ayala" title="wikilink">Luis Ayala</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Manager <a href="Terry_Collins" title="wikilink">Terry Collins</a> called the game &quot;enormous.&quot;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The Yankees still won the season series 4 games to 2.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>July 12, 2011 - Days after gaining entry into the <a href="3,000_hit_club" title="wikilink">3,000 hit club</a>, Yankee shortstop <a href="Derek_Jeter" title="wikilink">Derek Jeter</a> elected to sit out of the <a href="2011_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game" title="wikilink">2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game</a> citing &quot;physical and emotional exhaustion&quot; and recovery from a recent visit to the disabled list. Jeter, who throughout his career had been praised by people in and out of baseball for good behavior, was criticized by some players and officials including Mets outfielder <a href="Carlos_Beltr&lt;U+00E1&gt;n" title="wikilink">Carlos Beltr&lt;U+00E1&gt;n</a>. Beltran stated that &quot;I do believe, as a ballplayer, if you have no injuries, you should be here...the fans are the ones that vote for you and want to see you here.&quot; Mets shortstop <a href="Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Reyes_(shortstop)" title="wikilink">Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Reyes</a>, who also was injured, also opined on the incident saying &quot;I want to come no matter what happens.&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>June 8, 2012 - After pitching the first no-hitter in Mets history in his previous start, <a href="Johan_Santana" title="wikilink">Johan Santana</a> gives up a career-worst four home runs to the Yankees in the first Subway Series game of the year as the Mets, who were held hitless by <a href="Hiroki_Kuroda" title="wikilink">Hiroki Kuroda</a> until the sixth, lose 9-1. Two days later, after <a href="Rafael_Soriano" title="wikilink">Rafael Soriano</a> blew his first save of the year by surrendering an RBI double to <a href="Ike_Davis" title="wikilink">Ike Davis</a> in the top of the ninth, <a href="Russell_Martin" title="wikilink">Russell Martin</a> hit a home-run in the bottom of the inning off of <a href="Jon_Rauch" title="wikilink">Jon Rauch</a> to give the Yankees a 5-4 win and first-ever sweep of the Mets at the new Yankee Stadium.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>June 22, 2012 - One day before first pitch between the two teams at Citi Field, Mets closer <a href="Frank_Francisco" title="wikilink">Frank Francisco</a> taunted the Yankees by calling them chicken. Francisco's teammates greeted him in the Mets club house the next day with the <a href="Chicken_Dance" title="wikilink">Chicken Dance</a> and put up a pitcture of Derek Jeter's head on the body of a chicken. &quot;I can't wait to strike out those chickens, I want to strike out the side against them. I've done it before.&quot; Francisco would later go on to say &quot;I make a simple comment, just that they complain a lot—for every call, for everything, I thought it was funny. I didn't expect to make a big deal.&quot;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Although he would not strike out the side and allow two base runners, Francisco did notch the save in the first game of the series before going on the disabled list. Mets reliever <a href="Tim_Byrdak" title="wikilink">Tim Byrdak</a> would go as far to bring a live chicken into the clubhouse and named it &quot;Little <a href="Jerry_Seinfeld" title="wikilink">Jerry Seinfeld</a>&quot; in honor of a <em><a href="Seinfeld" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seinfeld</a></em> episode. The chicken was used as an unofficial mascot and was donated to an animal farm sanctuary in upstate New York a few days later. Francisco later admitted he himself raised chickens and is an expert about them.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Despite the Mets winning the opener, the Yankees wound up winning the next two games, including halting Mets pitcher <a href="R.A._Dickey" title="wikilink">R.A. Dickey</a>'s scoreless inning streak of  innings to win the series. Yankee outfielder <a href="Nick_Swisher" title="wikilink">Nick Swisher</a> playfully quipped at the end of the series &quot;who's chicken now?&quot; <a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></li>

<h2 id="rivalry-outside-of-baseball">Rivalry outside of baseball</h2>
<p>Outside of Major League Baseball, the teams rivalry has shown passions from fans of both sides.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the 1991 movie <em><a href="City_Slickers" title="wikilink">City Slickers</a></em> starring <a href="Billy_Crystal" title="wikilink">Billy Crystal</a>, Crystal's character is seen wearing a Mets hat. Crystal himself in reality is an avid and outspoken Yankee fan, so much that he had a personal friendship with his boyhood idol <a href="Mickey_Mantle" title="wikilink">Mickey Mantle</a> in as much he produced the movie <em><a href="61*" class="uri" title="wikilink">61*</a></em> about Mantle and <a href="Roger_Maris" title="wikilink">Roger Maris</a>'s chase for <a href="Babe_Ruth" title="wikilink">Babe Ruth</a>'s all time record for homeruns hit in a season. Crystal also celebrated his 60th birthday by signing a one-day contract with the Yankees in the 2008 Spring Training.</li>
<li>In the movie <em><a href="Two_Weeks_Notice" title="wikilink">Two Weeks Notice</a></em>, <a href="Sandra_Bullock" title="wikilink">Sandra Bullock</a> and <a href="Hugh_Grant" title="wikilink">Hugh Grant</a>'s characters Lucy Kelson and George Wade attended a Mets game. When an opposing player hit a pop-fly and Mets catcher Mike Piazza went towards the stands to get it, Lucy reached over and stole the pop fly from Piazza, preventing him from getting the player out. Piazza quipped saying she should be a Yankee fan.</li>
<li>During the 2000 World Series, the <a href="Mayor_of_New_York_City" title="wikilink">Mayor of New York City</a>, <a href="Rudy_Giuliani" title="wikilink">Rudy Giuliani</a>, showed no remorse in his partisan support of the Yankees despite being the sitting mayor in office, though he had attended Mets games before and after. Examples of this include the Mets opened the 1996 season, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch along with the <a href="Governor_of_New_York" title="wikilink">Governor of New York</a> <a href="George_Pataki" title="wikilink">George Pataki</a>,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> during the Mets' season opener in ,<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> and when the Mets hosted the first professional sporting event in New York since September 11, 2001.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></li>
<li>In 2010, pop star singer and Yankee fan <a href="Lady_Gaga" title="wikilink">Lady Gaga</a>, attended a Mets game at Citi Field with the San Diego Padres where she gave Met fans <a href="the_middle_finger" title="wikilink">the middle finger</a>. Actor and comedian <a href="Jerry_Seinfeld" title="wikilink">Jerry Seinfeld</a>, a Met fan, criticized Gaga for the incident due to children being at the game and became upset knowing that she had done the action from his personal luxury box.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></li>
