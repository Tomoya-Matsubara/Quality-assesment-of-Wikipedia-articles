<p><strong>Nachman of Breslov</strong> (), also known as <strong>Reb Nachman of Bratslav</strong>, <strong>Reb Nachman Breslover</strong> (), <strong>Nachman from Uman</strong> (April 4, 1772 â€“ October 16, 1810), was the founder of the <a href="Breslov_(Hasidic_dynasty)" title="wikilink">Breslov</a> <a href="Hasidic_Judaism" title="wikilink">Hasidic</a> movement.</p>
<p>Rebbe Nachman, a great grandson of the <a href="Baal_Shem_Tov" title="wikilink">Baal Shem Tov</a>, breathed new life into the Hasidic movement by combining the esoteric secrets of Judaism (the <a href="Kabbalah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kabbalah</a>) with in-depth <a href="Torah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Torah</a> scholarship. He attracted thousands of followers during his lifetime and his influence continues until today.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Rebbe Nachman's religious philosophy revolved around closeness to God and speaking to God in normal conversation &quot;as you would with a best friend.&quot; The concept of <em><a href="hitbodedut" class="uri" title="wikilink">hitbodedut</a></em> is central to his thinking.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

<p>Rebbe Nachman was born in the town of <a href="Medzhybizh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Medzhybizh</a>, <a href="Ukraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ukraine</a>. His mother, Feiga, was the daughter of Adil (also spelled Udel), daughter of the Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidic Judaism. His father Simcha was the son of Rabbi Nachman of <a href="Horodenka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Horodenka</a> (Gorodenka), one of the Baal Shem Tov's disciples, after whom Rebbe Nachman was named. Rebbe Nachman had two brothers, Yechiel Zvi and Yisroel Mes, and a sister, Perel.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Rebbe Nachman told his disciples that as a small child, he eschewed the pleasures of this world and set his sights on spirituality.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He paid his <a href="melamed" class="uri" title="wikilink">melamed</a> (teacher) three extra coins for every page of Talmud that he taught him, beyond the fee that his father was paying the teacher, to encourage the teacher to cover more material.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> From the age of six, he would go out at night to pray at the grave of his great-grandfather, the Baal Shem Tov, and immerse in the <a href="mikveh" class="uri" title="wikilink">mikveh</a> afterward.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>At the age of 13, he married Sashia, daughter of Rabbi Ephraim, and moved to his father-in-law's house in <a href="Ossatin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ossatin</a> (Staraya Osota today). He acquired his first disciple on his wedding day, a young man named Shimon who was several years older than he.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> He continued to teach and attract new followers in the <a href="Medvedevka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Medvedevka</a> region in the years that followed.</p>
<p>In 1798-1799 he traveled to the <a href="Land_of_Israel" title="wikilink">Land of Israel</a>, where he was received with honor by the Hasidim living in <a href="Haifa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haifa</a>, <a href="Tiberias" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tiberias</a>, and <a href="Safed" class="uri" title="wikilink">Safed</a>. In Tiberias, his influence brought about a reconciliation between the Lithuanian and Volhynian Hasidim.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Shortly before <a href="Rosh_Hashana" title="wikilink">Rosh Hashana</a> 1800, Rebbe Nachman moved to the town of <a href="Zlatopol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zlatopol</a>. The townspeople invited him to have the final word on who would lead the <a href="Rosh_Hashana" title="wikilink">Rosh Hashana</a> and <a href="Yom_Kippur" title="wikilink">Yom Kippur</a> prayer services. The man chosen to lead <em>Neilah</em>, the final prayer service of Yom Kippur, did not meet the Rebbe's approval. Suddenly the man was struck dumb and forced to step down, to his great embarrassment. After the fast ended, Rebbe Nachman spoke in a light-hearted way about what the man's true intentions had been, and the man was so incensed that he denounced Rebbe Nachman to Rabbi <a href="Aryeh_Leib_of_Shpola" title="wikilink">Aryeh Leib of Shpola</a>, known as the &quot;Shpoler Zeide&quot;, a prominent Hasidic rabbi and early disciple of Rabbi <a href="Pinchas_of_Koritz" title="wikilink">Pinchas of Koritz</a>, who was a leading figure in the first generation of Hasidut. Thus began the Shpoler Zeide's vehement campaign against Breslov Hasidism.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="move-to-breslov">Move to Breslov</h3>
<p><img src="Bratsalv.jpg" title="fig:River in Bratslav, central-west Ukraine" alt="River in Bratslav, central-west Ukraine" width="180" /> In 1802, Rebbe Nachman moved to the town of <a href="Bratslav" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bratslav</a>, <a href="Ukraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ukraine</a>, also known as &quot;Breslov&quot;. Here he declared, &quot;Today we have planted the name of the Breslover Hasidim. This name will never disappear, because my followers will always be called after the town of Breslov.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>His move to the town of Breslov brought him into contact with <a href="Nathan_of_Breslov" title="wikilink">Nathan Sternhartz</a> (&quot;Reb Noson&quot;), a 22-year-old Torah scholar in the nearby town of <a href="Nemirov" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nemirov</a>, eight miles north of Breslov. Over the next eight years, Reb Noson became his foremost disciple and scribe, recording all of Rebbe Nachman's formal lessons as well as transcribing the Rebbe's <a href="masterpiece" title="wikilink">magnum opus</a>, <em>Likutey Moharan</em>. After Rebbe Nachman's death, Reb Noson recorded all the informal conversations he and other disciples had had with the Rebbe, and published all of Rebbe Nachman's works as well as his own commentaries on them.</p>
<p>Rebbe Nachman and his wife Sashia had six daughters and two sons. Two daughters died in infancy and the two sons (Ya'akov and Shlomo Efraim) both died within a year and a half of their births. Their surviving children were Adil, Sarah, Miriam, and Chayah.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Sashia died of <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a> on June 11, 1807, the eve of <a href="Shavuot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shavuot</a>, and was buried in Zaslov just before the festival began.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The following month, Rebbe Nachman became engaged to a woman from Brody (name unknown). Right after the engagement, he contracted tuberculosis.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="move-to-uman">Move to Uman</h3>
<p>In May 1810, a fire broke out in Bratslav, destroying Rebbe Nachman's home. A group of <em><a href="Haskalah" title="wikilink">maskilim</a></em> (Jews belonging to the secular <em>Haskalah</em> [Enlightenment] movement) living in <a href="Uman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uman</a>, <a href="Ukraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ukraine</a> invited him to live in their town, and provided housing for him as his illness worsened. Many years before, Rebbe Nachman had passed through Uman and told his disciples, &quot;This is a good place to be buried.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He was referring to the <a href="cemetery" class="uri" title="wikilink">cemetery</a> where more than 20,000 Jewish <a href="martyr" title="wikilink">martyrs</a> were buried following the <a href="Massacre_of_Uman" title="wikilink">Haidamak Massacre of Uman</a> of 1768. Rebbe Nachman died of tuberculosis at the age of 38 on the fourth day of <a href="Sukkot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sukkot</a> 1810, and was buried in that cemetery.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="pilgrimage-tradition">Pilgrimage tradition</h2>
<p><img src="Nahmantomb.JPG" title="fig:Outside the modern-day synagogue which serves as the ohel for the grave of Rebbe Nachman." alt="Outside the modern-day synagogue which serves as the ohel for the grave of Rebbe Nachman." width="225" />  During the Rebbe's lifetime, thousands of Hasidim traveled to be with him for the <a href="Jewish_holiday" title="wikilink">Jewish holidays</a> of <a href="Rosh_Hashana" title="wikilink">Rosh Hashana</a>, <a href="Chanuka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chanuka</a>, and <a href="Shavuot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shavuot</a>, when he delivered his formal lessons. On the last Rosh Hashana of his life, Rebbe Nachman stressed to his followers the importance of being with him for that holiday in particular. Therefore, after the Rebbe's death, Reb Noson instituted an annual pilgrimage to the Rebbe's gravesite on Rosh Hashana.</p>
<p>This annual pilgrimage, called the <a href="Rosh_Hashana_kibbutz" title="wikilink">Rosh Hashana kibbutz</a>, drew thousands of Hasidim from all over Ukraine, <a href="Belarus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belarus</a>, <a href="Lithuania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lithuania</a> and even Poland until 1917, when the <a href="Bolshevik_Revolution" title="wikilink">Bolshevik Revolution</a> forced it to continue clandestinely. Only a dozen or so Hasidim risked making the annual pilgrimage during the <a href="Communism" title="wikilink">Communist</a> era, as the authorities regularly raided the gathering and often arrested and imprisoned worshippers. Beginning in the mid-1960s, Hasidim who lived outside Russia began to sneak into Uman to pray at Rebbe Nachman's grave during the year. After the fall of Communism in 1989, the gates were reopened entirely. In 2008, approximately 25,000 people from all over the world participated in this annual pilgrimage.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>In April 1810, Rebbe Nachman called two of his closest disciples, Rabbi <a href="Aharon_of_Breslov" title="wikilink">Aharon of Breslov</a> and Rabbi <a href="Naftali_of_Nemirov" title="wikilink">Naftali of Nemirov</a>, to act as witnesses for an unprecedented vow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If someone comes to my grave, gives a coin to charity, and says these ten Psalms [the <em>Tikkun HaKlali</em>], I will pull him out from the depths of <a href="Gehinnom" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gehinnom</a>!&quot; (Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom #141). &quot;It makes no difference what he did until that day, but from that day on, he must take upon himself not to return to his foolish ways&quot;.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This vow spurred many followers to undertake the trip to Rebbe Nachman's grave, even during the Communist crackdown.</p>
<h2 id="teachings">Teachings</h2>
<p>In his short life, Rebbe Nachman achieved much acclaim as a teacher and spiritual leader, and is considered a seminal figure in the history of Hasidism. His contributions to Hasidic Judaism include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>He rejected the idea of hereditary Hasidic dynasties, and taught that each Hasid must &quot;search for the <a href="tzaddik" class="uri" title="wikilink">tzaddik</a> ('saintly/righteous person')&quot; for himself â€” and within himself. He believed that every Jew has the potential to become a tzaddik.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He emphasized that a tzaddik should magnify the blessings on the community through his <a href="mitzvah" title="wikilink">mitzvot</a>. However, the tzaddik cannot &quot;absolve&quot; a Hasid of his sins, and the Hasid should pray only to God, not to the Rebbe. The purpose of confiding in another human being is to unburden the soul as part of the process of repentance and healing. (Modern psychology supports this idea, which is the &quot;Fifth Step&quot; in many <a href="12-step_program" title="wikilink">12-step programs</a> for recovery.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In his early life, he stressed the practice of fasting and self-castigation as the most effective means of repentance. In later years, however, he abandoned these severe ascetisms because he felt they may lead to depression and sadness. He told his followers not to be &quot;fanatics&quot;. Rather, they should choose one personal mitzvah to be very strict about, and do the others with the normal amount of care.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He encouraged his disciples to take every opportunity to increase holiness in themselves and their daily activities. For example, by marrying and living with one's spouse according to Torah law, one elevates sexual intimacy to an act bespeaking honor and respect to the God-given powers of procreation. This in turn safeguards the sign of the covenant, the <a href="brit_milah" title="wikilink">brit milah</a> (&quot;covenant of <a href="circumcision" class="uri" title="wikilink">circumcision</a>&quot;) which is considered the symbol of the everlasting pact between God and the Jewish people.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He urged everyone to seek out his own and others' good points in order to approach life in a state of continual happiness. If one cannot find any &quot;good points&quot; in himself, let him search his deeds. If he finds that his deeds were driven by ulterior motives or improper thoughts, let him search for the positive aspects within them. And if he cannot find any good points, he should at least be happy that he is a Jew. This &quot;good point&quot; is God's doing, not his.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He placed great stress on living with faith, simplicity, and joy. He encouraged his followers to clap, sing and dance during or after their prayers, bringing them to a closer relationship with God.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He emphasized the importance of intellectual learning and Torah scholarship. &quot;You can originate Torah novellae, but do not change anything in the laws of the <a href="Shulchan_Aruch" title="wikilink">Shulchan Aruch</a>!&quot; he said. He and his disciples were thoroughly familiar with all the classic texts of Judaism, including the <a href="Talmud" class="uri" title="wikilink">Talmud</a> and its commentaries, <a href="Midrash" class="uri" title="wikilink">Midrash</a>, and <a href="Shulchan_Aruch" title="wikilink">Shulchan Aruch</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He frequently recited extemporaneous <a href="prayer" title="wikilink">prayers</a>. He taught that his followers should spend an hour alone each day, talking aloud to God in his or her own words, as if &quot;talking to a good friend.&quot; This is in addition to the prayers in the <a href="siddur" class="uri" title="wikilink">siddur</a>. Breslover Hasidim still follow this practice today, which is known as <em><a href="hitbodedut" class="uri" title="wikilink">hitbodedut</a></em> (literally, &quot;to make oneself be in solitude&quot;). Rebbe Nachman taught that the best place to do <em>hitbodedut</em> was in a field or forest, among the natural works of God's creation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tikkun-haklali">Tikkun HaKlali</h3>

<p>Another prominent feature of Rebbe Nachman's teachings is his <em>Tikkun HaKlali</em> (&quot;General Rectification&quot; or &quot;General Remedy&quot;) for spiritual correction. This general rectification can override the spiritual harm caused by many sins, or one sin whose ramifications are many. Rebbe Nachman revealed that ten specific <a href="Psalms" class="uri" title="wikilink">Psalms</a>, recited in this order: Psalms 16, 32, 41, 42, 59, 77, 90, 105, 137, and 150, constitute a special remedy for the sin of wasting seed, which defiles the sign of the <a href="brit_milah" title="wikilink">covenant</a>, and, by extension, all the other <a href="mitzvah" title="wikilink">mitzvot</a>. Most Breslover Hasidim try to say the <em>Tikkun HaKlali</em> daily.</p>
<h2 id="controversy">Controversy</h2>
<p>Rebbe Nachman lived at a time of controversy between Hasidim and more traditional Orthodox Jews, known as <a href="Misnagdim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Misnagdim</a> (opponents) for their opposition to hasidism. It was also a time of friction between Hasidim and proponents of Jewish emancipation and <a href="Haskalah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haskalah</a>. (In 1816, <a href="Joseph_Perl" title="wikilink">Joseph Perl</a> wrote a denunciation of Hasidic mysticism and beliefs, in which he criticized many of the writings of Nachman, who had died six years earlier. Austrian imperial censors blocked publication of Perl's treatise, fearing that it would foment unrest among the empire's Jewish subjects.)</p>
<p>During his lifetime, Rebbe Nachman also encountered opposition from within the Hasidic movement itself, from people who questioned his new approach to Hasidut. One of these was Rabbi <a href="Aryeh_Leib_of_Shpola" title="wikilink">Aryeh Leib of Shpola</a>, known as the &quot;Shpoler Zeide&quot; (Grandfather/Sage of <a href="Shpola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shpola</a>) (1725&lt;U+2013&gt;1812), who, according to Breslov tradition, had supported Rebbe Nachman in his early years but began to oppose him after he moved to Zlatipola, near Shpola, in 1802.</p>
<p>The Shpoler Zeide saw Rebbe Nachman's teachings as deviating from classical Judaism and from the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov. Some postulate that the Zeide felt threatened because Rebbe Nachman was moving in on his territory and taking disciples away from him. Still others claim that Rebbe Nachman was a threat to other <a href="rebbe" title="wikilink">rebbes</a> because he opposed the institutional dynasties that were already beginning to form in the Hasidic world. (Rebbe Nachman himself did not found a dynasty; his two sons died in infancy and he appointed no successor.)</p>
<p>According to Breslov tradition, a number of prominent figures of Hasidut supported Rebbe Nachman against the Shpoler Zeide's opposition, including Rabbi <a href="Levi_Yitzchok_of_Berditchev" title="wikilink">Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev</a>, Rabbi <a href="Gedalia_of_Linitz" title="wikilink">Gedalia of Linitz</a>, Rabbi Zev Wolf of Charni-<a href="Ostrov" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ostrov</a>, and Rabbi <a href="Avraham_of_Kalisk" title="wikilink">Avraham of Kalisk</a>. Breslov traditions further relate, that at one point, a number of Hasidic rabbis gathered in <a href="Berdychiv" title="wikilink">Berditchev</a> to place the Shpoler Zeide in <em><a href="Herem_(censure)" title="wikilink">cherem</a></em> (a rabbinic form of excommunication) for showing contempt to a true Torah scholar. Their effort was nixed, however, when Rabbi Levi Yitzchak heard about the idea and persuaded them to desist.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="did-he-believe-he-was-the-messiah">Did he believe he was the Messiah?</h3>
<h4 id="secular-academic-view">Secular academic view</h4>
<p>The <a href="Encyclopaedia_Judaica" title="wikilink">Encyclopaedia Judaica</a> and other secular academic sources claim that Rebbe Nachman saw himself as the <a href="Jewish_messianism" title="wikilink">Messiah</a>. One proof that secular academics offer is that the messianic personality is expected to rectify errant souls. Rebbe Nachman did speak to his disciples about the principle of <em>tikkun</em> (rectification of souls), and even suggested that he was capable of rectifying souls. However, this power was also claimed by Rebbes of other Hasidic sects. The principle of <em>tikkun</em> is also found throughout the teachings of (Rabbi <a href="Isaac_Luria" title="wikilink">Isaac Luria</a>), who preceded Rebbe Nachman by several hundred years.</p>
<p>Some secular academics postulate that Rebbe Nachman was influenced by the teachings of <a href="Sabbatai_Zevi" title="wikilink">Sabbatai Zevi</a> and <a href="Jacob_Frank" title="wikilink">Jacob Frank</a>, false messiahs of the 17th and 18th centuries, respectively, but that he was not actually a Sabbatean or Frankist. As proof, they note that Rebbe Nachman's thinking on <em>tikkun olam</em>, the Kabbalistic healing of the universe, bears similarities to the teachings of Sabbatai Zevi. However in his writings, Rebbe Nachman refers to Sabbetai Zevi as <em>SHaTZ</em> (an acronym for his Hebrew name, <em>SHabbetai TZvi</em>) and concludes the reference with the expression <em>yimach shemo</em> (may his name be obliterated). The latter expression is generally reserved for the worst enemies of the Jewish people.</p>
<h4 id="breslov-view">Breslov view</h4>
<p>Rebbe Nachman never claimed that he was the Messiah. He taught the general Hasidic concept of the <em>tzaddik ha-dor</em> (<a href="tzadik" class="uri" title="wikilink">tzadik</a> of the generation or era<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a>), which is the idea that in every generation, a special, saintly person is born who could potentially become the Jewish Messiah if conditions were right in the world. Otherwise, this tzaddik lives and dies the same as any other holy man. Toward the end of his life, he said, &quot;My fire will burn until the coming of <a href="Jewish_messianism" title="wikilink">Mashiach</a>&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> â€” indicating that the Messiah had not yet arrived. Breslover Hasidim do not believe Rebbe Nachman was the Messiah, but they do believe that the light of his teachings continues to illuminate the paths of Jews from many disparate backgrounds. <a href="s:Chayey_Moharan" title="wikilink">Chayey Moharan</a> #266 states Rabbi Nachman said &quot;All the benefits Messiah can do for Israel, I can do; the only difference is Messiah will decree and it will happen, but I -- (and he stopped and did not say more) [alternate version: I cannot finish yet]&quot;</p>
<p>It should be noted that the Sabbateans based their teachings on the same <a href="Zohar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zohar</a> and <a href="Isaac_Luria" title="wikilink">Lurianic kabbalah</a> that are considered part of classical Judaism by Hasidism. Where the Sabbateans diverged from accepted teaching was in believing that Sabbatai Zevi was &quot;the Messiah&quot; and that the <a href="Halakha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Halakha</a> (Jewish law) was no longer binding. Rebbe Nachman did not do the same. He did not claim he was the Messiah, and when asked, &quot;What do we do as Breslover Hasidim?&quot; he replied, &quot;Whatever it says in the <a href="Shulchan_Aruch" title="wikilink">Shulchan Aruch</a> (Code of Jewish Law).&quot;</p>
<h2 id="published-works">Published works</h2>

<p>Rebbe Nachman's Torah lessons and stories were published and disseminated mainly after his death by his disciple, Reb Noson:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Likutey Moharan</em> (&quot;Collected Teachings of Our Teacher, Rabbi Nachman&quot;) (vol. i., Ostrog, 1808; vol. ii., Moghilev, 1811; vol. iii., Ostrog, 1815)â€”Hasidic interpretations of the <a href="Tanakh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tanakh</a>, <a href="Midrash" title="wikilink">Midrashim</a>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Sefer HaMidot</em> (<em>The Aleph-Bet Book</em>) (Moghilev, 1821)â€”a collection of practical advice gleaned from Torah sources, presented as epigrams or maxims and arranged alphabetically by topic.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Tikkun HaKlali</em> (&quot;General Remedy&quot;)â€”Rebbe Nachman's order of ten Psalms to be recited for various problems, plus commentary by Reb Noson. Published as a separate book in 1821.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="s:Tales_of_Rabbi_Nachman" title="wikilink">Sippurei Ma'asiyot</a></em> (<em>Tales of Rabbi Nachman</em> or <em>Rabbi Nachman's Stories</em>) (n.p., 1816)â€”13 story tales in <a href="Hebrew_language" title="wikilink">Hebrew</a> and <a href="Yiddish_language" title="wikilink">Yiddish</a> that are filled with deep mystical secrets. The longest of these tales is <em>The Seven Beggars</em>,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> which contains many kabbalistic themes and hidden allusions. Several fragmentary stories are also included in Rabbi <a href="Aryeh_Kaplan" title="wikilink">Aryeh Kaplan</a>'s translation of the complete tales, <em>Rabbi Nachman's Stories</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rebbe Nachman also wrote two other books, <em>Sefer HaGanuz</em> (&quot;The Hidden Book&quot;) and the <em>Sefer HaNisraf</em> (&quot;The Burned Book&quot;), neither of which are extant. Rebbe Nachman told his disciples that these volumes contained deep mystical insights which few would be able to comprehend. While he dictated the <em>Sefer HaNisraf</em> to Reb Noson, the latter said that he did not understand it at all; later he said, &quot;What I do remember is that it spoke about the greatness of the mitzvah of hospitality and preparing the bed for a guest&quot;.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Rebbe Nachman never showed the <em>Sefer HaGanuz</em> to anyone. In 1808 Rebbe Nachman burned all the copies of the <em>Sefer HaGanuz</em> and the <em>Sefer Ha-nisraf</em>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
