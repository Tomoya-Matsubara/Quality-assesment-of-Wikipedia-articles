She continued her work in education with Mayor <a href="Abraham_Beame" title="wikilink">Abraham Beame</a>, managing a training program for school security officers. In the late 1970s, she was recruited to run the <a href="New_York_Police_Foundation" title="wikilink">New York Police Foundation</a>. At the Police Foundation, she developed an innovative citywide health screening and work-site hypertension program with the <a href="New_York_City_Police_Department" title="wikilink">New York City Police Department</a> and facilitated an intensive training program for 911 operators. She created a program engaging New York City in a campaign to purchase <a href="bulletproof_vests" title="wikilink">bulletproof vests</a> for every police officer. In 1990 newly elected Mayor <a href="David_Dinkins" title="wikilink">David Dinkins</a> appointed her the first female New York City Commissioner of the Department of Parks &amp; Recreation. Gotbaum created a toll-free Parks hotline and successfully argued for a change in city policy allowing the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) and other organizations to use <a href="Central_Park" title="wikilink">Central Park</a> for fundraising events. </p>
<p>After leaving the Parks Department in 1994, Gotbaum became President of the <a href="New-York_Historical_Society" title="wikilink">New-York Historical Society</a>, a position she held until launching her campaign for Public Advocate in 2001. When she took over, the Historical Society was closed to the public and on the verge of bankruptcy after years of mismanagement. Gotbaum rescued the institution from financial collapse, renovated its landmark building, and recalled its collections from various warehouses. In November 2000, she opened the <strong>Henry Luce III Center for the Study of American Culture</strong>. She instituted exhibitions, education and public programs for a diverse and ever-increasing audience, leaving the society with a $33 million endowment. Gotbaum resigned from the Historical Society to run for the Office of the Public Advocate. </p>

She battled Bloomberg on mayoral succession issues.  In return, Bloomberg sought to eliminate the office altogether in 2002 and reduced its budget. At the request of the <a href="New_York_State_Legislature" title="wikilink">New York State Legislature</a>, Gotbaum created a Commission on School Governance to examine mayoral control before it expires in 2009. </p>
<h2 id="race-for-public-advocate-1">2005 Race for Public Advocate</h2>

<p>Gotbaum was featured in this docudrama directed by Madeleine Sackler, in which she shared some of her views:</p>
<ul>
<li>Against charter schools &lt;U+2014&gt; Charter schools are not the answer, poverty is the problem in the New York Education system</li>
<li>Pro-teachers' unions &lt;U+2014&gt; <em>&quot;I think the union is a force in New York City as well it should be. I think the union is here to stay I don't think it&lt;U+2019&gt;s going anywhere. And I think to think that you can get rid of it is a mistake.&quot;</em> </li>
