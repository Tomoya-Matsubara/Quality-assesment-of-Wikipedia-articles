Serving with the Australian Flying Corps, he was honoured for his actions on 20 March 1917, when he rescued a fellow pilot who had been forced down behind enemy lines. McNamara was the first Australian aviator, and the only one in <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, to receive the Victoria Cross.

In addition, McNamara's role overseas had become redundant.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> He was discharged from the Air Force on 11 July.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> In May 1946, the British government offered McNamara the position of Senior Education Control Officer in <a href="Westphalia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Westphalia</a>, Germany, under the auspices of the <a href="Allied_Control_Council" title="wikilink">Allied Control Commission</a>.

<p>Embittered by his dismissal from the RAAF and the meagre <a href="Severance_package" title="wikilink">severance</a> he received from the Australian Government, McNamara had insisted that his Victoria Cross not be returned to Australia after his death; his family donated it to the <a href="Royal_Air_Force_Museum" title="wikilink">RAF Museum</a>, London.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Fellow No. 1 Squadron pilot, Lieutenant (later Air Vice Marshal) <a href="Adrian_Cole_(RAAF_officer)" title="wikilink">Adrian Cole</a>, described McNamara as &quot;quiet, scholarly, loyal and beloved by all ... the last Officer for whom that high honour would have been predicted&quot;.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a><a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> He was one of the few Victoria Cross winners to subsequently attain senior rank in the armed services, however RAAF historian Dr Alan Stephens considered that his appointments were &quot;in the main routine&quot; and that his one great deed led to &quot;a degree of fame that he perhaps found burdensome&quot;.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a><a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Biographer Chris Coulthard-Clark summed up McNamara's &quot;dilemma&quot; as that of &quot;an essentially ordinary man&quot; thrust into the limelight by one &quot;truly amazing episode&quot;.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> His name is borne by Frank McNamara Park in <a href="Shepparton,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Shepparton, Victoria</a>,<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> and the Frank McNamara VC Club at <a href="Oakey_Army_Aviation_Centre" title="wikilink">Oakey Army Aviation Centre</a>, <a href="Queensland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queensland</a>.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a><a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>
