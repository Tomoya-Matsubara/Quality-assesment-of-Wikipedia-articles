<p><strong>Christopher Darrell Matthews</strong> (born <a href="September_22" title="wikilink">September 22</a>, <a href="1962" class="uri" title="wikilink">1962</a>, <a href="Perth,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Perth</a>, <a href="Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Western Australia</a>) is a former <a href="Australia" title="wikilink">Australian</a> <a href="cricketer" class="uri" title="wikilink">cricketer</a>, who played for the <a href="Australian_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Australian cricket team</a>, the <a href="Western_Warriors" title="wikilink">Western Warriors</a>, <a href="Lancashire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Lancashire County Cricket Club</a>, and the <a href="Tasmanian_Tigers" title="wikilink">Tasmanian Tigers</a>. Chris Matthews was an excellent left arm fast bowler, who generated lively pace, and performed well in the test arena, but was overshadowed by the emergence of young <a href="Queensland_Bulls" title="wikilink">Queensland</a> firebrand, <a href="Craig_McDermott" title="wikilink">Craig McDermott</a>, and never had the opportunity to show his true talent. Matthews signed for <a href="Lancashire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Lancashire County Cricket Club</a> in 1988, but only managed three matches for them. He returned to Western Australia, but failed to hold down a regular spot, and so moved to the <a href="Tasmanian_Tiger" title="wikilink">Tasmanian Tiger</a>'s in 1990, where he became highly successful, taking 119 wickets for them before retiring at the end of the 1994-95 season.</p>
