The purpose of Mudkip in the games, anime and manga, as with all other Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, is to battle both wild Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, untamed creatures encountered while the player passes through various environments, and tamed Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon owned by <a href="Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon_trainer" title="wikilink">Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon trainers</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Mudkip's name is a <a href="portmanteau" class="uri" title="wikilink">portmanteau</a> of <em>mud</em>, being a surrounding of its natural habitat, and &quot;Kip&quot;, which refers to &quot;Skip&quot;, relating to the <a href="Mudskipper" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mudskipper</a>, the fish it resembles.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The &quot;-kip&quot; may also come from the fish-species <a href="Kipper" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kipper</a>. The name <em>Mudkip</em> refers to both the overall species, and to individual Mudkip within the <a href="Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon_(video_games)" title="wikilink">games</a>, <a href="Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon_(anime)" title="wikilink">anime</a> and <a href="manga" class="uri" title="wikilink">manga</a> series. Its Japanese name is likely a <a href="portmanteau" class="uri" title="wikilink">portmanteau</a> of , water, and , <a href="Mudskipper" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mudskipper</a>.</p>
<h2 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h2>
<p>The fin on Mudkip's head acts as highly sensitive radar. Using this fin to sense movements of water and air, Mudkip can determine what is taking place around it without using its eyes. When in water, Mudkip breathes using the gills on its cheeks. On land, it can powerfully lift large boulders by planting its four feet and heaving. It sleeps by burying itself in soil at the water's edge. Its large tail fin propels it through water with powerful acceleration. If it is faced with a tight situation in battle, Mudkip will become strong enough to crush rocks bigger than itself.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>It is a <a href="Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon_types#Water-type" title="wikilink">Water-type</a> Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, meaning it specialzes in firing water (in bubbles or in jet spurts) to attack foe. Mudkip evolves, a metamorphic change within a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon caused by gaining experience in battle,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> into <a href="Marshtomp" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marshtomp</a>, its Stage-1 (middle) form at level 16, and evolves into its Stage-2 (final) form, <a href="Swampert" class="uri" title="wikilink">Swampert</a>, at Level 36.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Mudkip is often chosen as a starter because its evolved forms, Marshtomp and <a href="Swampert" class="uri" title="wikilink">Swampert</a> are <a href="Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon_types#Water-type" title="wikilink">Water-type</a> and <a href="Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon_types#Ground-type" title="wikilink">Ground-type</a>, meaning they specialize in ground-based moves as well as water-based moves. Being part ground-type gives Swampert and Marshtomp immunity to <a href="Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon_types#Electric-type" title="wikilink">electricity-based</a> moves, which water types would normally take a lot of damage from. Also, Swampert is considered an &quot;overused Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon&quot;, meaning that it is used very often in battles.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>One interesting thing about Mudkip is that its evolved forms, Marshtomp and Swampert, cannot learn Hydro Pump, which is a powerful water-based attack. On the other hand, Mudkip would learn this move at Level 42.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Mudkip is also one of the main characters in <em><a href="Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon_Mystery_Dungeon" title="wikilink">Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Mystery Dungeon</a></em>, for the <a href="Nintendo_DS" title="wikilink">Nintendo DS</a> and <a href="Nintendo_Game_Boy_Advance" title="wikilink">Nintendo Game Boy Advance</a>. At the beginning of the game, the player takes a personality quiz.

If Bulbasaur or another Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon is selected as the player, however, Mudkip can become one of the player's &quot;partners&quot; at the beginning of the game.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Mudkipstar.jpg" title="fig:Mudkip (as &quot;Mudkip Star&quot;) in the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Trading Card Game (EX Team Rocket Returns set)." alt="Mudkip (as &quot;Mudkip Star&quot;) in the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Trading Card Game (EX Team Rocket Returns set)." width="150" /> The <em><a href="Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon_Trading_Card_Game" title="wikilink">Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Trading Card Game</a></em> is a <a href="Collectible_card_game" title="wikilink">collectable card game</a> first published by <a href="Wizards_of_the_Coast" title="wikilink">Wizards of the Coast</a> in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a>, in 1999. The concept is similar to that of a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon battle in the video games in that each player takes turns to hit the opponent&lt;U+2019&gt;s Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon. In the card game, Mudkip is a Water-type Basic pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, just like its video game counterparts. As a basic pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, it can be played in a battle, as the competitions of the card game are called, without the use of a special card. If the player has a <a href="Marshtomp" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marshtomp</a> card in their hand, they can play it on top of the Mudkip card, which is the card game's equivalent of evolving.</p>
<p>Mudkip has appeared several times in the <em><a href="Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon_Trading_Card_Game" title="wikilink">Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Trading Card Game</a></em>. It has appeared in the sets <em>EX Ruby &amp; Sapphire</em> (two different cards), <em>EX Dragon</em>, and <em>EX Emerald</em>. It also appears in <em>EX Team Rocket Returns</em>, but as &quot;Mudkip Star&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> This card is different then the other Mudkip cards in that it is rarer than the rest of the cards in the set.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>One rule when playing with <em>Star</em> cards &lt;U+2014&gt; including <em>Mudkip Star</em> from the <em>EX Team Rocket Returns</em> set &lt;U+2014&gt; is that Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon with significant terms in their titles (often used to denote Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon that are all part of one set) can only evolve into Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon that also share this term. Though there is no mention on how to evolve <em>Star Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon</em>, if the rule for other <a href="suffix" title="wikilink">suffixes</a> is followed, <em>Mudkip Star</em> could only be replaced by a Marshtomp card with <em>Star</em> in its title &lt;U+2014&gt; a card which, at this point, does not exist.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> However, since players can only have one &quot;Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon <em>Star</em>&quot; card in their deck, then they couldn't evolve <em>Mudkip Star</em> into <em>Marshtomp Star</em>. This makes <em>Star</em> cards somewhat impractical, since they cannot be upgraded from their Basic stage state; they are primarily savoured for their rarity instead.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
