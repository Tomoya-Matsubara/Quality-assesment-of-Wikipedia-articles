<h4 id="jacqueline-vs.-sable">Jacqueline vs. Sable</h4>
<p>Jacqueline joined the <a href="World_Wrestling_Entertainment" title="wikilink">World Wrestling Federation</a> in mid-1998. She debuted as the on-screen girlfriend of the <a href="heel_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">heel</a> <a href="Marc_Mero" title="wikilink">Marc Mero</a> and began a feud with <a href="Rena_Mero" title="wikilink">Sable</a>, the estranged wife of Mero. After Jacqueline and Sable traded insults on several occasions, Jacqueline challenged Sable to a <a href="Bikini_contest" title="wikilink">bathing suit contest</a>. The contest took place on <a href="July_26" title="wikilink">July 26</a> at <a href="Fully_Loaded" title="wikilink">Fully Loaded</a>, with Sable winning after she removed her <a href="Halterneck" title="wikilink">halter top</a> to reveal a painted on <a href="bikini" class="uri" title="wikilink">bikini</a> top. However, the following evening on <em><a href="WWE_RAW" title="wikilink">RAW</a></em>, WWF Chairman <a href="Vince_McMahon" title="wikilink">Vince McMahon</a> disqualified Sable as <em>&quot;body paint does not constitute a bikini&quot;</em>, and Jacqueline was awarded the winner's trophy.</p>
<p>Sable recruited <a href="Gertrude_Vachon" title="wikilink">Luna Vachon</a> and the other <a href="Oddities" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oddities</a> to fight Jacqueline for her, and helped Luna pin Jacqueline on the <a href="August_10" title="wikilink">August 10</a> episode of <em>RAW</em>. After the match, Sable gave the unconscious Jacqueline's trophy to Luna. Jacqueline demanded that the trophy be returned, and faced Sable in an <a href="arm_wrestling" title="wikilink">arm wrestling</a> contest on the <a href="August_17" title="wikilink">August 17</a> episode of <em>RAW</em>. During the contest, Jacqueline broke her grip and pushed the table into Sable's <a href="solar_plexus" title="wikilink">solar plexus</a>, winding her and enabling Jacqueline to retrieve her trophy.</p>
<p>Jacqueline and Mero teamed together to face Sable and a mystery opponent on <a href="August_30" title="wikilink">August 30</a> at <a href="SummerSlam_(1998)" title="wikilink">SummerSlam 1998</a>. Sable's partner was revealed to be <a href="Adam_Copeland" title="wikilink">Edge</a>, but he was sidelined for much of the match as Jacqueline dominated Sable, preventing her from tagging out. After Sable finally managed to tag Edge, he delivered the <a href="Professional_wrestling_throws#Complete_shot" title="wikilink">Downward Spiral</a> to Mero and then placed Sable atop him, thus winning the match for himself and Sable and humiliating Mero by causing him to lose to his wife.</p>
<p>After Sable defeated Jacqueline in an <a href="Professional_wrestling_match_types#Evening_gown_match" title="wikilink">evening gown match</a> on the <a href="September_14" title="wikilink">September 14</a> episode of <em>RAW</em>, Jacqueline demanded a singles bout with Sable. The resultant match was filmed on <a href="September_15" title="wikilink">September 15</a> in <a href="Sacramento,_California" title="wikilink">Sacramento</a>, but broadcast as the <a href="September_21" title="wikilink">September 21</a> episode of <em>RAW</em>. With the revived <a href="WWE_Women&#39;s_Championship" title="wikilink">WWF Women's Championship</a> on the line (the Women's Championship had been abandoned in January <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a>, two months after <a href="Debra_Miceli" title="wikilink">Alundra Blayze</a> had left the WWF with the title itself and joined WCW, where she was shown dropping the belt into a <a href="Dustbin" title="wikilink">trash can</a>), Jacqueline defeated Sable after Mero tripped Sable and held her foot down, preventing her from kicking out of Jacqueline's <a href="Professional_wrestling_holds#Cover" title="wikilink">pin</a>.</p>
<p>Jacqueline and Sable continued to feud, with Jacqueline cutting off Sable's <a href="ponytail" class="uri" title="wikilink">ponytail</a> on the <a href="October_5" title="wikilink">October 5</a> episode of <em>RAW</em>. While Jacqueline enjoyed a strong run as champion, squashing challengers such as <a href="Noreen_Greenwald" title="wikilink">Starla Saxton</a>, Mero began to lose more and more frequently. On <a href="October_26" title="wikilink">October 26</a>, Sable challenged Jacqueline to a title match at <a href="Survivor_Series#1998" title="wikilink">Survivor Series 1998</a>. The title bout took place on <a href="November_15" title="wikilink">November 15</a> in the <a href="Scottrade_Center" title="wikilink">Kiel Center</a> in <a href="St._Louis,_Missouri" title="wikilink">St. Louis</a>. With <a href="Shane_McMahon" title="wikilink">Shane McMahon</a> acting as referee, Sable defeated Jacqueline to become the new WWF Women's Champion.</p>
<h4 id="pretty-mean-sisters">Pretty Mean Sisters</h4>
<p>Jacqueline and Mero separated on the <a href="November_22" title="wikilink">November 22</a> episode of <em><a href="WWE_HEAT" title="wikilink">Sunday Night HEAT</a></em>, and the jilted Jacqueline formed a <a href="stable_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">stable</a> of women known as the <a href="Pretty_Mean_Sisters" title="wikilink">Pretty Mean Sisters</a> (or &quot;<a href="Premenstrual_stress_syndrome" title="wikilink">P.M.S.</a>&quot;) with <a href="Terri_Runnels" title="wikilink">Terri Runnels</a>, who was separated from her husband, <a href="Virgil_Runnels_III" title="wikilink">Goldust</a>. During a match between Mero and Goldust on the <a href="November_23" title="wikilink">November 23</a> episode of RAW, Jacqueline and Terri entered the ring and <a href="Professional_wrestling_attacks#Low_blow" title="wikilink">low-blowed</a> both men.</p>
<p>In January <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a>, Terri claimed to have suffered a <a href="miscarriage" class="uri" title="wikilink">miscarriage</a> after she was knocked of the ring apron by <a href="Accie_C._Connor" title="wikilink">D'Lo Brown</a>. The guilty Brown essentially became a servant to P.M.S., who humiliated him and forced him to wrestle his friend, <a href="Mark_Henry" title="wikilink">Mark Henry</a>. The deception lasted until <a href="February_1" title="wikilink">February 1</a>, when the ringside <a href="Medicine" title="wikilink">doctor</a> told Brown that Terri had not been <a href="pregnant" class="uri" title="wikilink">pregnant</a>. P.M.S. then feuded with Brown, costing him matches and attacking his newly debuted manager, <a href="Lisa_Moretti" title="wikilink">Ivory</a>. Jacqueline returned to the women's division in March 1999, and on the <a href="April_12" title="wikilink">April 12</a> episode of <em>RAW</em> she, Ivory, <a href="Terri_Poch" title="wikilink">Tori</a> and Sable took part in a four way match for the Women's Championship. The match was declared a no-contest after Sable's <a href="bodyguard" class="uri" title="wikilink">bodyguard</a> <a href="Nicole_Bass" title="wikilink">Nicole Bass</a> stormed the ring and <a href="Chokeslam" title="wikilink">chokeslammed</a> the three challengers.</p>
<p>P.M.S. gained a &quot;<a href="Love_slave" title="wikilink">Love slave</a>&quot;, <a href="Shawn_Stasiak" title="wikilink">Meat</a>, in May 1999. In the same month the stable expanded once more to incorporate <a href="Alicia_Webb" title="wikilink">Ryan Shamrock</a>, who had been spurned by the womanizing <a href="Sean_Morley" title="wikilink">Val Venis</a>. Shamrock left both the stable and the WWF in the following months, while Terri and Jacqueline assisted Meat in his matches. Tension began to grow between the two women as Terri exhausted Meat with hours of <a href="sex" class="uri" title="wikilink">sex</a> before his matches, then berated her fatigued lover when he lacked the energy to win matches, and Jacqueline left the stable after Terri forced Meat to kiss her feet on the <a href="August_1" title="wikilink">August 1</a> episode of <em>Sunday Night HEAT</em>.</p>
<h4 id="solo-career">Solo career</h4>
<p>On the <a href="September_6" title="wikilink">September 6</a> episode of <em>RAW</em>, Jacqueline faced the <a href="misogynistic" class="uri" title="wikilink">misogynistic</a> <a href="Jeff_Jarrett" title="wikilink">Jeff Jarrett</a> in advance of his <a href="WWE_Intercontinental_Championship" title="wikilink">WWF Intercontinental Championship</a> match with <a href="Joanie_Laurer" title="wikilink">Chyna</a>. Jarrett <a href="squash_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">squashed</a> Jacqueline, choking her with the ring ropes, forcing her to submit with the <a href="Professional_wrestling_holds#Figure_four_leglock" title="wikilink">figure four leglock</a> and breaking a <a href="guitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitar</a> over her head.</p>
<p>Jacqueline soon returned to her pursuit of the Women's Championship, which she failed to win from Ivory in a three way <a href="Professional_wrestling_match_types#Hardcore_Rules_Match" title="wikilink">hardcore match</a> which also included Luna on <a href="November_18" title="wikilink">November 18</a>. On <a href="November_25" title="wikilink">November 25</a>, Jacqueline defeated Ivory in a &quot;gravy bowl match&quot; to win the Golden Ladle Trophy. At <a href="WWE_Armageddon#1999" title="wikilink">Armageddon 1999</a> on <a href="December_12" title="wikilink">December 12</a> she took part in a four way evening gown match for the Women's Championship, but was stripped following a combined assault from her opponents, Ivory, <a href="Stacy_Carter" title="wikilink">Miss Kitty</a> and <a href="Cathy_Dingman" title="wikilink">B.B.</a>. On <a href="January_23" title="wikilink">January 23</a>, <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a> at the <a href="Royal_Rumble_(2000)" title="wikilink">Royal Rumble</a>, Jacqueline entered the &quot;Miss Royal Rumble&quot; swimit contest, which was won by <a href="Mae_Young" title="wikilink">Mae Young</a>.</p>

Her reign lasted throughout <a href="February_2000" title="wikilink">February</a> and <a href="March_2000" title="wikilink">March</a>, with Jacqueline defeating Ivory and <a href="Amy_Dumas" title="wikilink">Lita</a> to retain the title, until <a href="March_30" title="wikilink">March 30</a>, when she was challenged by <a href="Stephanie_McMahon-Levesque" title="wikilink">Stephanie McMahon</a>. The inexperienced Stephanie defeated Jacqueline following extensive interference from <a href="D-Generation_X" title="wikilink">D-Generation X</a>.</p>
<p>Jacqueline's requests for a rematch were denied, and she lost a <a href="battle_royal" title="wikilink">battle royal</a> for the number one contendership to Lita. On the <a href="July_2" title="wikilink">July 2</a> episode of <em>Sunday Night HEAT</em>, <a href="WWE_Light_Heavyweight_Championship" title="wikilink">WWF Light Heavyweight Champion</a> <a href="Dean_Simon" title="wikilink">Dean Malenko</a> challenged <em>&quot;anyone with enough manhood&quot;</em> to face him. After Jacqueline came to the ring, Malenko explained that he had said <em>&quot;manhood, not somebody <u>from</u> the hood.&quot;</em> Jacqueline was granted a title shot, but submitted to Malenko's <a href="Professional_wrestling_holds#Texas_cloverleaf" title="wikilink">Texas cloverleaf</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout <a href="August_2000" title="wikilink">August</a> and <a href="September_2000" title="wikilink">September</a>, Jacqueline feuded with WWF Women's Champion Lita, aligning herself with <a href="Edge_and_Christian" title="wikilink">Edge and Christian</a> to counter the presence of Lita's constant companions, <a href="Hardy_Boyz" title="wikilink">The Hardy Boyz</a>. She received further title shots on <a href="October_9" title="wikilink">October 9</a> and <a href="November_2" title="wikilink">November 2</a>, but failed to unseat Lita on both occasions.</p>
<h4 id="the-a.p.a.">The A.P.A.</h4>
<p>The <a href="Acolyte_Protection_Agency" title="wikilink">Acolyte Protection Agency</a> (<a href="Ron_Simmons" title="wikilink">Faarooq</a> and <a href="John_Layfield" title="wikilink">Bradshaw</a>) recruited Jacqueline on the <a href="December_18" title="wikilink">December 18</a> episode of RAW, asking her to take care of <a href="Trish_Stratus" title="wikilink">Trish Stratus</a> while they fought Stratus' clients, <a href="T_&amp;_A" title="wikilink">T &amp; A</a>.

On the <a href="December_21" title="wikilink">December 21</a> episode of <em><a href="WWE_Friday_Night_SmackDown!" title="wikilink">SmackDown!</a></em>, Jacqueline challenged <a href="Right_to_Censor" title="wikilink">Right to Censor</a> member Ivory to a title match. After the other members of R.T.C. distracted Jacqueline and enabled Ivory to pin her, the A.P.A. repaid the favor by saving Jacqueline from a group beating after the match.</p>
<p>The feud between the A.P.A. and R.T.C. continued throughout early-<a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>, and culminated in a match at <a href="WrestleMania_X-Seven" title="wikilink">WrestleMania X-Seven</a> on <a href="April_1" title="wikilink">April 1</a> which pitted R.T.C. (<a href="Barry_Buchanan" title="wikilink">Bull Buchanan</a>, <a href="Charles_Wright_(wrestler)" title="wikilink">The Goodfather</a> and Val Venis) against The A.P.A. and <a href="Peter_Senerca" title="wikilink">Tazz</a>. In the early stages of the match, Jacqueline <a href="DDT_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">DDT'ed</a> <a href="Michael_Manna" title="wikilink">Steven Richards</a>, the leader of R.T.C. who had accompanied them to ringside. R.T.C. lost the match after Bradshaw pinned The Goodfather.</p>

Several weeks later, Jacqueline challenged Trish for the title at <a href="WWE_Vengeance#2001" title="wikilink">Vengeance 2001</a>. Due to Trish's relative inexperience, Jacqueline dominated the match but was surprised by a backslide pin costing herself victory and another championship reign. Jacqueline and Trish did shake hands before and after the match, in a show of good sportsmanship.</p>
