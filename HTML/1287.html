<h3 id="goodales-cutoff">Goodale's Cutoff</h3>
<p>European <a href="Trapping_(Animal)" title="wikilink">fur trappers</a> avoided the lava field area below the Pioneer Mountains by following Indian trails.

<p>After <a href="gold" class="uri" title="wikilink">gold</a> was discovered in the <a href="Salmon_River_(Idaho)" title="wikilink">Salmon River</a> area of Idaho, a group of emigrants persuaded an <a href="Illinois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Illinois</a>-born trapper and trader named <a href="Tim_Goodale" title="wikilink">Tim Goodale</a> to lead them through the cutoff.

<p>In 1879, two Arco cattlemen named Arthur Ferris and J.W.

<p>The few whites who visited the area in the 19th century created local legends that it looked like the surface of the <a href="Moon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moon</a>. Geologists Harold T.

<p>A series of newspaper and magazine articles written by Limbert were later published about this and previous treks, which increased public awareness of the area.

Various types of volcanos may form at these vents: gas-rich pulverized lava creates <a href="cinder_cone" title="wikilink">cinder cones</a> (such as Inferno Cone &lt;U+2013&gt; stop 4), and pasty lava blobs form <a href="spatter_cone" title="wikilink">spatter cones</a> (such as Spatter Cones &lt;U+2013&gt; stop 5).<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Later stages of an eruption push lava streams out through the side or base of cinder cones, which usually ends the life of the cinder cone (North Crater, Watchmen, and Sheep Trail Butte are notable exceptions). This will sometimes breach part of the cone and carry it away as large and craggy blocks of cinder (as seen at North Crater Flow &lt;U+2013&gt; stop 2 &lt;U+2013&gt; and Devils Orchard &lt;U+2013&gt; stop 3). Solid crust forms over lava streams and lava tubes (a type of cave), and are created when lava vacates its course (examples can be seen at the Cave Area &lt;U+2013&gt; stop 7).</p>
<p>Geologists feared that a large <a href="1983_Borah_Peak_earthquake" title="wikilink">earthquake</a> that shook <a href="Borah_Peak" title="wikilink">Borah Peak</a>, Idaho's tallest mountain, in 1983 would restart volcanic activity at Craters of the Moon, though this proved not to be the case.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Geologists predict that the area will experience its next eruption some time in the next 900 years with the most likely period in the next 100 years.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="conditions">Conditions</h3>
<p><img src="Scoria_field_at_Craters_of_the_Moon_NM-750px.JPG" title="fig:This scoria field shows typical conditions at Craters of the Moon." alt="This scoria field shows typical conditions at Craters of the Moon." /> All plants and animals that live in and around Craters of the Moon are under great environmental stress due to constant dry <a href="wind" title="wikilink">winds</a> and heat-absorbing black lavas that tend to quickly sap water from living things. Summer <a href="soil" class="uri" title="wikilink">soil</a> temperatures often exceed  and plant cover is generally less than 5% on cinder cones and about 15% over the entire monument.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Adaptation is therefore necessary for survival in this <a href="semi-arid" class="uri" title="wikilink">semi-arid</a> harsh <a href="climate" class="uri" title="wikilink">climate</a>.</p>
<p>Water is usually only found deep inside holes at the bottom of blow-out craters.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Animals therefore get the moisture they need directly from their food.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The black soil on and around cinder cones does not hold moisture for long, making it difficult for plants to establish themselves. Soil particles first develop from direct rock decomposition by <a href="lichen" title="wikilink">lichens</a> and typically collect in crevices in lava flows. Successively more complex plants then colonize the microhabitat created by the increasingly productive soil.</p>
<p>The shaded north slopes of cinder cones provide more protection from direct <a href="sun" title="wikilink">sunlight</a> and prevailing southwesterly winds and have a more persistent snow cover (an important water source in early spring). These parts of cinder cones are therefore colonized by plants first.</p>
<p>Gaps between lava flows were sometimes cut-off from surrounding vegetation. These literal islands of habitat are called <a href="k&lt;U+012B&gt;puka" title="wikilink">k&lt;U+012B&gt;pukas</a>, a <a href="Hawaiian_language" title="wikilink">Hawaiian</a> name used for older land surrounded by younger lava. Carey K&lt;U+012B&gt;puka is one such area in the southernmost part of the monument and is used as a benchmark to measure how plant cover has changed in less pristine parts of southern Idaho.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="plants">Plants</h3>
<p>There are 375 <a href="species" class="uri" title="wikilink">species</a> of plant known to grow in the monument. When wildflowers are not in bloom, most of the vegetation is found in semi-hidden pockets and consists of <a href="pine_tree" title="wikilink">pine trees</a>, cedars, <a href="juniper" title="wikilink">junipers</a>, and <a href="sagebrush" class="uri" title="wikilink">sagebrush</a>. Strategies used by plants to cope with the adverse conditions include:<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Drought tolerance by physiological adaptations such as the ability to survive extreme <a href="dehydration" class="uri" title="wikilink">dehydration</a> or the ability to extract water from very dry soil. Sagebrush and <a href="Purshia_tridentata" title="wikilink">Antelope Bitterbrush</a> are examples.</li>
<li>Drought avoidance by having small, hairy, or succulent leaves to minimize moisture loss or otherwise conserve water. Hairs on scorpionweed, the succulent parts of the <a href="Opuntia" title="wikilink">Pricklypear Cactus</a>, and the small leaves of the <a href="Stephanomeria" title="wikilink">Wirelettuce</a> are all local examples.</li>

<li>Drought escape by growing in small crevices or near persistent water supplies, or by staying dormant for about 95% of the year.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> <a href="Moss" title="wikilink">Mosses</a> and <a href="fern" title="wikilink">ferns</a> in the area grow near constant water sources such as natural potholes and seeps from <a href="ice_cave" title="wikilink">ice caves</a>. <a href="Penstemon_deustus" title="wikilink">Scabland</a> <a href="Penstemon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Penstemon</a>, Fernleaf <a href="Fleabane" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fleabane</a>, and <a href="Potentilla" title="wikilink">Gland Cinquefoil</a> grow in shallow crevices. <a href="Syringa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syringa</a>, <a href="Spiraea" title="wikilink">Bush Rockspirea</a>, <a href="Chamaebatiaria" title="wikilink">Tansybush</a>, and even <a href="Limber_Pine" title="wikilink">Limber Pine</a> grow in large crevices.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> While <a href="Mimulus" title="wikilink">Dwarf Monkeyflowers</a> (<a href=":Image:Monkeyflower_at_Craters_of_the_Moon_National_Monument.jpeg" title="wikilink">photo</a>) carry out their entire <a href="biological_life_cycle" title="wikilink">life cycle</a> during the short wet part of the year and survive in <a href="seed" class="uri" title="wikilink">seed</a> form the rest of the time.</li>
</ul>
<p>A common plant seen on the lava field is the Dwarf <a href="Buckwheat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buckwheat</a> (<a href=":image:Drawf_Buckweat_at_Craters_of_the_Moon_National_Monument.jpeg" title="wikilink">photo</a>), a flowering plant  tall with a root system  wide.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The root system monopolizes soil moisture in its immediate area, resulting in individual plants that are evenly spaced. Consequently, many visitors have asked park rangers if the buckwheat were systematically planted.</p>
<p><a href="Wildflower" title="wikilink">Wildflowers</a> bloom from early May to late September but most are gone by late August.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Moisture from snow-melt along with some rainfall in late spring kick-starts the <a href="germination" class="uri" title="wikilink">germination</a> of annual plants, including wildflowers. Most of these plants complete their entire <a href="biological_life_cycle" title="wikilink">life cycle</a> in the few months each year that moisture levels are good. The onset of summer decreases the number of wildflowers and by autumn only the tiny yellow flowers of sagebrush and rabbitbrush remain. Some wildflowers that grow in the area are the <a href="Balsamorhiza_sagittata" title="wikilink">Arrow-leaved</a> <a href="Balsamorhiza" title="wikilink">Balsamroot</a>, <a href="Bitterroot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bitterroot</a>, <a href="Liatris" title="wikilink">Blazing Star</a>, <a href="Lomatium" title="wikilink">Desert Parsley</a>, Dwarf Monkeyflower, <a href="Butterfly_weed" title="wikilink">Paintbrush</a>, <a href="Phacelia_bolanderi" title="wikilink">Scorpionweed</a>, Scabland Penstemon and the <a href="Wild_Onion" title="wikilink">Wild Onion</a>.</p>
<h3 id="animals">Animals</h3>
<p>Years of cataloging by biologists and park rangers have recorded 2000 species of insect, 8 reptiles, 169 birds, 48 mammals, and even one amphibian (the <a href="Western_Toad" title="wikilink">Western Toad</a>). Birds and some <a href="rodent" title="wikilink">rodents</a> are seen most frequently in the Craters of the Moon area.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> <a href="Brown_Bear" title="wikilink">Brown Bears</a> once roamed this area but have long ago become locally <a href="extinction" title="wikilink">extinct</a>. Traditional <a href="livestock" class="uri" title="wikilink">livestock</a> grazing continues within the grass/shrublands administered by the BLM.</p>
<p><img src="Marmot_at_Devils_Orchard_in_Craters_of_the_Moon_NM-550px.JPG" title="fig:Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel at Devil&#39;s Orchard" alt="Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel at Devil&#39;s Orchard" /> Most desert animals are <a href="nocturnal" class="uri" title="wikilink">nocturnal</a>, or mainly active at night. Nocturnal behavior is an adaptation to both predation and hot summer daytime temperatures. Nocturnal animals at Craters of the Moon include <a href="woodrat" title="wikilink">woodrats</a> (also called packrats), <a href="skunk" title="wikilink">skunks</a>, <a href="fox" title="wikilink">foxes</a>, <a href="bobcat" title="wikilink">bobcats</a>, <a href="mountain_lion" title="wikilink">mountain lions</a>, <a href="bat" title="wikilink">bats</a>, <a href="nighthawk" title="wikilink">nighthawks</a>, <a href="owl" title="wikilink">owls</a>, and most other small desert rodents.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>Animals that are most active at dawn and dusk, when temperatures are cooler than mid-day, are called <a href="crepuscular" class="uri" title="wikilink">crepuscular</a>. The subdued morning and evening light helps make them less visible to predators, but is bright enough to allow them to locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include <a href="mule_deer" title="wikilink">mule deer</a>, <a href="coyote" title="wikilink">coyotes</a>, <a href="porcupine" title="wikilink">porcupines</a>, <a href="Mountain_Cottontail" title="wikilink">Mountain Cottontails</a>, <a href="jackrabbit" title="wikilink">jackrabbits</a>, and many <a href="songbird" title="wikilink">songbirds</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>Some desert animals are diurnal, or primarily active during the day. These include <a href="ground_squirrel" title="wikilink">ground squirrels</a>, <a href="marmot" title="wikilink">marmots</a>, <a href="chipmunk" title="wikilink">chipmunks</a>, <a href="lizard" title="wikilink">lizards</a>, <a href="snake" title="wikilink">snakes</a>, <a href="hawk" title="wikilink">hawks</a>, and <a href="eagle" title="wikilink">eagles</a>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>Many animals have a specific temperature range where they are active, meaning the times they are active vary with the seasons. Snakes and lizards <a href="hibernation" title="wikilink">hibernate</a> during the winter months, are diurnal during the late spring and early fall, and become crepuscular during the heat of summer. Many insects and some birds also alter their times of activity. Some animals, like ground squirrels and marmots, have one or more periods of <a href="estivation" class="uri" title="wikilink">estivation</a>, a summer hibernation that allows them to avoid the hottest and driest periods.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>Several animals are unique to Craters of the Moon and the surrounding area. Subspecies of <a href="Great_Basin_Pocket_Mouse" title="wikilink">Great Basin Pocket Mouse</a>, <a href="pika" class="uri" title="wikilink">pika</a>, <a href="Yellow-pine_Chipmunk" title="wikilink">Yellow-pine Chipmunk</a>, and <a href="Yellow-bellied_Marmot" title="wikilink">Yellow-bellied Marmot</a> are found nowhere else.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> <a href="Lava_tube_beetle" title="wikilink">Lava tube beetles</a> and many other cave animals are found only in the lava tubes of eastern Idaho.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="mule-deer">Mule Deer</h4>
<p>In May 1980 wildlife researcher Brad Griffith of the <a href="University_of_Idaho" title="wikilink">University of Idaho</a> started a three year study to mark and count the <a href="Mule_Deer" title="wikilink">Mule Deer</a> in the monument.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The <a href="National_Park_Service" title="wikilink">National Park Service</a> was concerned that the local herd might grow so large that it would damage its habitat. Griffith found that this group of Mule Deer has developed a totally unique <a href="drought" class="uri" title="wikilink">drought</a> evasion strategy for its species.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="deer" class="uri" title="wikilink">deer</a> arrive in the southern part of the pre-2000 extent of the monument mid-April each year once winter snows have melted away enough to allow for foraging. Griffith found that by late summer plants in the area have already matured and dried to the point that they can no longer provide enough moisture to sustain the deer. In late July after about 12 days above  and warm nights above  the herd migrates  north to the Pioneer Mountains to obtain water from free-flowing streams and shade themselves in <a href="aspen" class="uri" title="wikilink">aspen</a> and <a href="Douglas-fir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Douglas-fir</a> groves.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Rain in late September prompts the herd to return to the monument to feed on bitterbrush until snow in November triggers them to migrate back to their winter range. This herd, therefore, has a dual summer range. It is also very productive with one of the highest fawn survival rates of any herd in the species.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>Afternoon winds usually die down in the evening, prompting behavioral modifications in the herd. The deer avoid the dry wind by being more active at night when the wind is not blowing.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> In 1991 there was a three-year average of 420 Mule Deer.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="CRMO_loop_drive_map.png" title="fig:Craters of the Moon Loop Drive map" alt="Craters of the Moon Loop Drive map" width="350" /> A series of fissure vents, cinder cones, <a href="volcanic_cone#Spatter_cone" title="wikilink">spatter cones</a>, rafted blocks, and overlapping lava flows are accessible from the Loop Drive,  long. <a href="Wildflower" title="wikilink">Wildflowers</a>, shrubs, trees, and wild animals can be seen by hiking on one of the many trails in the monument or by just pulling over into one of the turn-offs. More rugged hiking opportunities are available in the Craters of the Moon Wilderness Area and Backcountry Area, the roadless southern and major part of the monument.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Visitor Center is located near the monument's only entrance. Various displays and publications along with a short film about the geology of the area help to orient visitors. Ranger-led walks are available in summer and cover topics such as wildlife, flowers, plants, or geology. Self-guiding tours and displays are available year-round and are easily accessible from the Loop Drive.</li>
<li>A paved trail less than 1/4 mile (400 m) long at <em>North Crater Flow</em> (<a href=":image:North_Crater_cinder_cone_and_flow-1200px.jpeg" title="wikilink">photo</a>) crosses the North Crater Lava Flow, which formed about 2200 years ago, making it one of the youngest lava flows on the Craters of the Moon Lava Field.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> This lava is named for the purplish-blue tint that tiny pieces of <a href="obsidian" class="uri" title="wikilink">obsidian</a> (volcanic glass) on its surface exhibit. Good examples of pahoehoe (ropey), aa (jagged), and some block lava are readily visible along with large rafted crater wall fragments. The rafted crater wall fragments seen on the flow were once part of this cinder cone but were torn away when the volcano's lava-filled crater was breached. A 1.8-mile-long trail (2.9 km) includes the 1/2 mile (800 m) overlook trail but continues on through the crater and to the Big Craters/Spatter Cones parking lot.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></li>
<li><em>Devils Orchard</em> (<a href=":image:Devils_Orchard_at_Craters_of_the_Moon_National_Monument.jpeg" title="wikilink">photo</a>) is a group of lava-transported cinder cone fragments (also called monoliths or cinder crags) that stand in cinders. Like the blocks at stop 2 they were once part of the North Crater cinder cone but broke off during an eruption of lava. A 1/2 mile-long (800 m) paved loop trial through the formations and trees of the &quot;orchard&quot; is available.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> The interpretive displays on the trail emphasize human impacts to the area.</li>
<li><em>Inferno Cone Viewpoint</em> (<a href=":Image:Craters_of_the_Moon_National_Monument_from_Inferno_Cone-2000px.jpg" title="wikilink">photo</a>) is located on top of Inferno Cone cinder cone. A short but steep trail up the cinder cone leads to an overlook of the entire monument. From there the Spatter Cones can be seen just to the south along with a large part of the Great Rift. In the distance is the over 700-foot-tall (&gt;200 m) Big Cinder Butte, one of the world's largest, purely <a href="basalt" title="wikilink">basaltic</a>, cinder cones.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Further away are the Pioneer Mountains (behind the Visitor Center) and beyond the monument are the <a href="White_Knob_Mountains" title="wikilink">White Knob Mountains</a>, the <a href="Lost_River_Range" title="wikilink">Lost River Range</a>, and the <a href="Lemhi_Range" title="wikilink">Lemhi Range</a>.</li>
<li><em>Big Craters and Spatter Cones</em> (<a href=":image:Spatter_Cones_at_Craters_of_the_Moon_National_Monument.jpeg" title="wikilink">photo</a>) sit directly along the local part of the Great Rift fissure. Spatter cones are created by accumulations of pasty gas-poor lava as they erupt from a vent. Big Craters is a cinder cone complex located less than  up a steep foot trail.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></li>
<li><em>Tree Molds</em> (<a href=":image:Tree_mold_at_Craters_of_the_Moon_National_Monument.jpeg" title="wikilink">photo</a>) is an area within the Craters of the Moon Wilderness where lava flows overran part of a forest. The trees were incinerated but as some of them burned they released enough water to cool the lava to form a cast. Some of these casts survived the eruption and mark the exact location and shape of the burning trees in the lava. Both holes and horizontal molds were left, some still showing shapes indicative of bark. The actual Tree Molds area is located a mile (1.6 km) from the Tree Molds parking lot and <a href="picnic" class="uri" title="wikilink">picnic</a> area off a moderately difficult wilderness trail.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The Wilderness trail also leaves from this parking lot, and extends nearly  into the wilderness area before gradually disappearing near The Sentinel cinder cone. The  Broken Top loop trail encircles the youngest cinder cone in the monument and can be done separately or as part of a longer trek on the Wilderness trail. A pull off on the spur road leading to the Tree Molds area presents the Lava Cascades, a frozen river of Blue Dragon Flow lava that temporarily pooled in the Big Sink.</li>
<li><em>Cave Area</em> is the final stop on Loop Drive and, as the name indicates, has a collection of lava tube <a href="cave" title="wikilink">caves</a>. Formed from the Blue Dragon Flow, the caves are located a half-mile (800 m) from the parking lot and include,<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></li>

<p>Backcountry <a href="hiking" class="uri" title="wikilink">hiking</a> is available in the Craters of the Moon Wilderness and the much larger Backcountry Area beyond (added in 2000). Only two trails enter the <a href="wilderness_area" title="wikilink">wilderness area</a> and even those stop after a few miles or kilometers. From there most hikers follow the Great Rift and explore its series of seldom-visited volcanic features. All overnight backcountry hikes require registration with a ranger. No drinking water is available in the backcountry and the dry climate quickly dehydrates hikers. Avoiding summer heat and winter cold are therefore recommended by rangers. Pets, camp fires, and all mechanized vehicles, including bicycles, are not allowed in the wilderness area.</p>
<p>Skiing is allowed on the Loop Drive after it is closed to traffic in late November due to <a href="snow_drift" title="wikilink">snow drifts</a>.
