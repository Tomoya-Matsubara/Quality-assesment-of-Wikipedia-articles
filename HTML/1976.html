A <a href="homing_pigeon" title="wikilink">homing pigeon</a> was fitted with an aluminum breast harness to which a lightweight time-delayed miniature camera could be attached. Neubronner's German patent application was initially rejected, but was granted in December 1908 after he produced authenticated photographs taken by his pigeons. He publicized the technique at the 1909 Dresden International Photographic Exhibition, and sold some images as <a href="postcard" title="wikilink">postcards</a> at the Frankfurt International Aviation Exhibition and at the 1910 and 1911 <a href="Paris_Air_Show" title="wikilink">Paris Air Shows</a>. The lack of military or commercial interest in the technology after the First World War led Neubronner to abandon his experiments, but his idea was briefly resurrected in the 1930s by a Swiss <a href="clockmaker" class="uri" title="wikilink">clockmaker</a>, and reportedly also by the German and French militaries and the American <a href="Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="wikilink">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA).</p>
<p>The construction of sufficiently small and light cameras with a timer mechanism, and the training and handling of the birds to carry the necessary loads, presented major challenges, as did the limited control over the pigeons' position, orientation and speed when the photographs were being taken. In 2004 the <a href="BBC" title="wikilink">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> (BBC) used miniature television cameras attached to falcons and goshawks to obtain live footage, and today some researchers, enthusiasts and artists similarly employ small digital photo or video cameras with various species of wild or domestic animals.</p>

(The pigeon post was discontinued after three years when the sanatorium was closed.) He delivered urgent medications up to  by the same method, and positioned some of his pigeons with his wholesaler in Frankfurt to profit from faster deliveries himself. When one of his pigeons lost its orientation in fog and mysteriously arrived, well-fed, four weeks late, Neubronner was inspired with the playful idea of equipping his pigeons with automatic cameras to trace their paths. This thought led him to merge his two hobbies into a new &quot;double sport&quot; combining <a href="carrier_pigeon" title="wikilink">carrier pigeon</a> fancying with amateur photography.

In 1907 he had sufficient success to apply for a patent. Initially his invention &quot;Method of and Means for Taking Photographs of Landscapes from Above&quot; was rejected by the German patent office as impossible, but after presentation of authenticated photographs the patent was granted in December 1908.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> (The rejection was based on a misconception about the carrying capacity of <a href="Domestic_Pigeon" title="wikilink">domestic pigeons</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>) The technology became widely known through Neubronner's participation in the 1909 International Photographic Exhibition in <a href="Dresden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dresden</a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and the 1909 International Aviation Exhibition in Frankfurt.

<p>A photograph of Schlosshotel Kronberg (then called <em>Schloss Friedrichshof</em> after its owner <a href="Victoria,_Princess_Royal" title="wikilink">Kaiserin Friedrich</a>) became famous due to its accidental inclusion of the photographer's wing tips. In a breach of copyright it was shown in German cinemas as part of the weekly <a href="newsreel" class="uri" title="wikilink">newsreel</a> in 1929.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>In a short book published in 1909 Neubronner described five camera models:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &quot;double camera&quot; described in the patent had two lenses pointing in opposite directions (forward/backward), each with a <a href="focal_length" title="wikilink">focal length</a> of 40 mm. Operated by a single <a href="focal-plane_shutter" title="wikilink">focal-plane shutter</a>, the camera could take two simultaneous <a href="photographic_plate" title="wikilink">glass plate</a> exposures at a time determined by the pneumatic system.</li>
<li>A <a href="stereoscopy" title="wikilink">stereoscopic</a> camera had similar characteristics, but both lenses pointed in the same direction.</li>
<li>One model was capable of transporting film and taking several exposures in a row.</li>
<li>One model had its lens fixed to a <a href="bellows_(photography)" title="wikilink">bag bellows</a>. A <a href="scissor_mechanism" title="wikilink">scissor mechanism</a> held the bellows in its expanded state until the photo was taken, but condensed it immediately afterwards. This allowed one exposure of size 6 cm &lt;U+00D7&gt; 9 cm on a photographic plate, at a focal length of 85 mm.</li>
<li>In a panoramic camera, the focal-plane shutter was replaced by a rotation of 180&lt;U+00B0&gt; of the lens itself.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> This model was the basis for the <a href="Doppel-Sport_Panoramic_Camera" title="wikilink">Doppel-Sport Panoramic Camera</a>, which Neubronner tried to market around 1910. It captured a panoramic view on 3 cm &lt;U+00D7&gt; 8 cm film. It never went into serial production, though.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In a 1920 pamphlet, Neubronner described his last model as weighing slightly more than  and being capable of taking 12 exposures.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In 2007, a researcher remarked that only little technical information is available about lenses, shutters and the speed of the photographic media, but reported that Neubronner obtained the film for his panoramic camera from <a href="ADOX" class="uri" title="wikilink">ADOX</a>. For this camera he estimated a <a href="film_speed" title="wikilink">film speed</a> of ISO 25/15&lt;U+00B0&gt; &lt;U+2013&gt; 40/17&lt;U+00B0&gt; and a shutter speed of 1/60 s &lt;U+2013&gt; 1/100 s. The film was cut to the format 30 mm &lt;U+00D7&gt; 60 mm and bent into a concave shape to prevent unnecessary distortion due to the half-circle movement of the lens.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1920 Neubronner found that ten years of hard work and considerable expenses had been rewarded only with his inclusion in encyclopedias and the satisfaction that an ancillary technology, the mobile dovecote (described below), had proved its worth in the war.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Neubronner's panoramic camera is displayed at the <a href="German_Museum_of_Technology" title="wikilink">German Museum of Technology</a> in Berlin and the <a href="Deutsches_Museum" title="wikilink">Deutsches Museum</a> in Munich.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="first-world-war">First World War</h2>
<p>Neubronner's invention was at least partially motivated by the prospect of military applications. At the time photographic aerial reconnaissance was possible but cumbersome, as it involved <a href="Balloon_(aircraft)" title="wikilink">balloons</a>, <a href="kite" title="wikilink">kites</a> or <a href="rocket" title="wikilink">rockets</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The <a href="Wright_brothers" title="wikilink">Wright brothers</a>' successful flight in 1903 presented new possibilities, and <a href="surveillance_aircraft" title="wikilink">surveillance aircraft</a> were introduced and perfected during the First World War. But pigeon-based photography, despite its practical difficulties, promised to deliver complementary, detailed photographs taken from a lower height.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="File:Neubronner_mobile_dovecote_and_darkroom.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|left|upright=0.7|Neubronner's mobile <a href="dovecote" class="uri" title="wikilink">dovecote</a> and darkroom as shown at 1909 exhibitionsThe</a> <a href="Prussian_Minister_of_War" title="wikilink">Prussian War Ministry</a> was interested, but some initial skepticism could only be overcome through a series of successful demonstrations. The pigeons proved relatively indifferent to explosions, but during battle a dovecote may need to be moved, and pigeons can take some time to orient to their new position.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The problem of making carrier pigeons accept a displaced dovecote with only a minimum of retraining had been tackled with some success by the Italian army around 1880;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> the French artillery captain Reynaud solved it by raising the pigeons in an itinerant dovecote.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> There is no indication that Neubronner was aware of this work, but he knew there must be a solution as he had heard of an itinerant fairground worker who was also a <a href="pigeon_keeping" title="wikilink">pigeon fancier</a> with a dovecote in his <a href="travel_trailer" title="wikilink">trailer</a>. At the 1909 exhibitions in Dresden and Frankfurt he presented a small carriage that combined a <a href="darkroom" class="uri" title="wikilink">darkroom</a> with a mobile dovecote in flashy colors. In months of laborious work he trained young pigeons to return to the dovecote even after it was displaced.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1912<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Neubronner completed his task (set in 1909) of photographing the waterworks at <a href="Tegel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tegel</a> using only his mobile dovecote. Almost 10 years of negotiations were scheduled to end in August 1914 with a practical test at a maneuver in <a href="Strasbourg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Strasbourg</a>, followed by the state's acquisition of the invention. These plans were thwarted by the outbreak of the war. Neubronner had to provide all his pigeons and equipment to the military, which tested them in the battlefield with satisfactory results, but did not employ the technique more widely.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Instead, under the novel conditions of <a href="attrition_warfare" title="wikilink">attrition warfare</a>, <a href="War_pigeon#World_War_I" title="wikilink">war pigeons</a> in their traditional role as <a href="pigeon_post" title="wikilink">pigeon post</a> saw a renaissance. Neubronner's mobile dovecote found its way to the <a href="Battle_of_Verdun" title="wikilink">Battle of Verdun</a>, where it proved so advantageous that similar facilities were used on a larger scale in the <a href="Battle_of_the_Somme" title="wikilink">Battle of the Somme</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> After the war, the War Ministry responded to Neubronner's inquiry to the effect that the use of pigeons in aerial photography had no military value and further experiments were not justified.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>Although <a href="war_pigeon" title="wikilink">war pigeons</a> and mobile dovecotes were used extensively during the Second World War, it is not clear to what extent, if any, they were employed for aerial photography. According to a report in 1942, the Russian army discovered abandoned German trucks with pigeon cameras that could take photos in five-minute intervals, as well as dogs trained to carry pigeons in baskets.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> On the allied side, as late as 1943 it was reported that the American <a href="Signal_Corps_(United_States_Army)" title="wikilink">Signal Corps</a> was aware of the possibility of adopting the technique.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>It is certain, however, that during the Second World War pigeon photography was introduced into German nurseries in toy form. From around 1935 the toy figures produced under the brand <em>Elastolin</em>, some of which show motifs from before 1918 with updated uniforms, began to include a signal corps soldier with a pigeon transport dog. The soldier releases a pigeon that carries an oversized pigeon camera.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Thanks to research conducted by the <em>Mus&lt;U+00E9&gt;e suisse de l'appareil photographique</em> at <a href="Vevey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vevey</a>, much more is known about the pigeon cameras developed at about the same time by the Swiss clockmaker Christian Adrian Michel (1912&lt;U+2013&gt;1980)<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> in <a href="Schmiedrued" title="wikilink">Walde</a>. He was assigned to the <a href="Military_of_Switzerland" title="wikilink">Swiss Army</a>'s carrier pigeons service in 1931, and in 1933 he began work on adapting Neubronner's panoramic camera to <a href="16_mm_film" title="wikilink">16 mm film</a>, and improving it with a mechanism to control the delay before the first exposure and to transport the film between exposures. Michel's camera, patented in 1937,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> weighed only , and may have been one of the first to have a timer operated by <a href="clockwork" class="uri" title="wikilink">clockwork</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Michel's plan to sell his camera to the Swiss Army failed, as he was unable to find a manufacturer to produce it in quantity. Only about 100 of his cameras were constructed.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> After the outbreak of the Second World War Michel patented a shell and harness for the transport of items such as film rolls by carrier pigeon.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Between 2002 and 2007 three of his cameras were auctioned by <a href="Christie&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christie's</a> in London.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
