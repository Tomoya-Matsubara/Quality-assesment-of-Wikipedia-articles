<p><strong>The Librarian of <a href="Unseen_University" title="wikilink">Unseen University</a></strong> is a recurring character in <a href="Terry_Pratchett" title="wikilink">Terry Pratchett</a>'s <em><a href="Discworld" class="uri" title="wikilink">Discworld</a></em> series of fantasy novels.</p>
<h2 id="fictional-history">Fictional history</h2>
<p>The Librarian appeared in the first novel of the series, <em><a href="The_Colour_of_Magic" title="wikilink">The Colour of Magic</a></em>, and was transformed into an <a href="orang-utan" class="uri" title="wikilink">orang-utan</a> in <em><a href="The_Light_Fantastic" title="wikilink">The Light Fantastic</a></em> as the Octavo fired a beam of magic upwards. On discovering that being an orang-utan had certain advantages for a librarian - he can climb up to high shelves, for example - he refused to be transformed back into a human and has remained an orang-utan ever since. The other wizards have gradually become used to the situation, to the extent that, from <em><a href="Night_Watch_(novel)" title="wikilink">Night Watch</a></em>: &lt;U+2018&gt;if someone ever reported that there was an orang-utan in the Library, the wizards would probably go and ask the Librarian if he'd seen it.&lt;U+2019&gt;</p>
<p>Being an ape, he is known for his violent reaction to most people calling him a &quot;<em><a href="monkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">monkey</a></em>.&quot; He speaks a language whose vocabulary consists primarily of the single word <em>Ook</em> (originally <em>Oook</em>), inflected for simple affirmations and negations. <em>Eeek</em> is also occasionally heard, particularly in moments of panic or rage. Nonetheless, most people seem able to understand him.</p>
<p>The Librarian's name has never been given in any of the books; he is always simply &lt;U+2018&gt;the Librarian.&lt;U+2019&gt; If the Librarian's true name were known, he could be changed back into a human, and he has from <em><a href="The_Last_Continent" title="wikilink">The Last Continent</a></em> carefully excised his name from the records of the University. <em><a href="The_Discworld_Companion" title="wikilink">The Discworld Companion</a></em> hints that he may once have been Dr. Horace Worblehat, which goes most of the way to explaining why he is happier as an orang-utan. <em><a href="The_Art_of_Discworld" title="wikilink">The Art of Discworld</a></em> confirms that the Librarian was indeed Dr. Horace Worblehat, and that his fears of turning back into human are baseless at most &lt;U+2013&gt; although with such a name, one can surmise a past which he is reluctant to return to. <a href="Rincewind" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rincewind</a> is apparently the only wizard who still remembers the Librarian's name, but has agreed not to tell anyone.</p>
<p>The Librarian served a brief stint in the <a href="City_Watch" title="wikilink">City Watch</a> during the reign of terror caused by the dragon of <a href="Ankh-Morpork" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ankh-Morpork</a>, where he helped to rescue <a href="Samuel_Vimes" title="wikilink">Sam Vimes</a> from the <a href="Havelock_Vetinari" title="wikilink">Patrician's</a> cell. He retained an honorary position with the Watch, and is considered as of <em><a href="Thud!" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thud!</a></em> to be one of the first members of the 'Specials' &lt;U+2013&gt; the Ankh-Morpork City Militia. He also used the Librarian ability of travelling through <a href="L-Space" class="uri" title="wikilink">L-Space</a>, (mentioned below, an <a href="extradimensional" class="uri" title="wikilink">extradimensional</a> space that connects all libraries and other large accumulations of books) to save books from the great library of <a href="Discworld_geography#Ephebe" title="wikilink">Ephebe</a> in <em><a href="Small_Gods" title="wikilink">Small Gods</a></em>, (it is as-of-yet unknown if this also includes <a href="Death_(Discworld)" title="wikilink">Death's</a> infinite Autobiography Library.) In <em><a href="Soul_Music_(novel)" title="wikilink">Soul Music</a></em>, he joined the <a href="Band_with_Rocks_In" title="wikilink">Band with Rocks In</a> since his large hands and wide reach make him an excellent keyboard player, though he left before they became famous (a reference to <a href="Pete_Best" title="wikilink">Pete Best</a> and the <a href="Beatles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beatles</a>). He remains the chief organist for the <a href="Unseen_University" title="wikilink">Unseen University</a>, and does not consider an organ complete without a vox diabolica-stop, a thunder pedal, and a 256-ft Earthquake pipe.</p>
<p>The Librarian is a member of a small elite group of senior librarians who have the knowledge and ability to travel through <a href="L-space" class="uri" title="wikilink">L-space</a>. The very strict rules that members of this group are pledged to enforce are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Silence</li>
<li>Books must be returned no later than the date shown</li>
<li>Do not meddle with the nature of <a href="causality" class="uri" title="wikilink">causality</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, the Librarian has been known to break both the first and third rules on occasion, but he is adamant about the second.</p>
<p>In <em><a href="Men_at_Arms" title="wikilink">Men at Arms</a></em>, it is stated that the Librarian likes being the <a href="Wedding_ceremony_participants#Best_man" title="wikilink">Best Man</a> at weddings because he is allowed to kiss the <a href="bridesmaid" title="wikilink">bridesmaids</a> and they are not allowed to run away; in <em><a href="Lords_and_Ladies" title="wikilink">Lords and Ladies</a></em> the Librarian served as the Best Man for Magrat and Verence.</p>
<p>The cover of the Discworld picture book <em><a href="Where&#39;s_My_Cow?" title="wikilink">Where's My Cow?</a></em> indicates that it has won the <a href="Ankh-Morpork" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ankh-Morpork</a> Librarian's award.</p>
<h2 id="in-other-media">In other media</h2>
<p>The Librarian appears in orang-utan form in the video games <a href="Discworld_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Discworld</a> and <a href="Discworld_II" title="wikilink">Discworld II</a>. In the first game, a <a href="running_gag" title="wikilink">running gag</a> is used where he assaults anybody who happens to say the word &quot;monkey&quot;, either deliberately or by accident, followed by the victim inquiring &quot;Did you get the number of that donkey cart?&quot;. In the second game, the violence is toned down, and he simply gets irritated whenever the word monkey is said. Rincewind states at one point, &quot;I happen to know there is no animation of me being hit on the head &lt;U+2013&gt; why do you think the Librarian's letting me off so easily this time?&quot;.</p>
<p>In <a href="Terry_Pratchett&#39;s_The_Colour_of_Magic" title="wikilink">the 2008 TV adaptation</a> of <em>The Colour of Magic</em> and <em>The Light Fantastic</em>, by <a href="Sky_One" title="wikilink">Sky One</a>, he appears in both human and orang-utan form. His human form is played by Nicolas Tennant, who had previously played <a href="Nobby_Nobbs" title="wikilink">Corporal Nobbs</a> in <em><a href="Terry_Pratchett&#39;s_Hogfather" title="wikilink">Terry Pratchett's Hogfather</a></em>. This adaptation also establishes his name as Horace Worblehat.</p>
