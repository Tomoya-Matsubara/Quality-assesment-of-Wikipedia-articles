<p><strong>Samuel &quot;Sam&quot; Babson Fuld</strong> (born November 20, 1981) is an American professional <a href="baseball" class="uri" title="wikilink">baseball</a> <a href="outfielder" class="uri" title="wikilink">outfielder</a> with the <a href="Tampa_Bay_Rays" title="wikilink">Tampa Bay Rays</a> of <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite being diagnosed with <a href="diabetes" class="uri" title="wikilink">diabetes</a> at the age of 10, Fuld began his baseball career by twice <a href="Batting_average_(baseball)" title="wikilink">batting</a> .600 in high school, during which time <em><a href="Baseball_America" title="wikilink">Baseball America</a></em> ranked him 19th in the country.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He then played college baseball at <a href="Stanford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stanford</a>, where he was an <a href="All_American" title="wikilink">All American</a>, set the school record for career <a href="run_(baseball)" title="wikilink">runs</a> scored, and set the <a href="College_World_Series" title="wikilink">College World Series</a> record for career <a href="hit_(baseball)" title="wikilink">hits</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Fuld was drafted by the <a href="Chicago_Cubs" title="wikilink">Chicago Cubs</a> in 2004. He was an <a href="All_Star" title="wikilink">All Star</a> two years later in the <a href="Florida_State_League" title="wikilink">Florida State League</a>. A year after that, he was voted the Most Valuable Player in the <a href="Arizona_Fall_League" title="wikilink">Arizona Fall League</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Fuld made his major league debut with the Cubs in 2007. He became a fan favorite for his acrobatic defense.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> After the 2010 season, he was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>Fuld, who is Jewish,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> is the son of Kenneth Fuld, the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Professor of Psychology at the <a href="University_of_New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">University of New Hampshire</a>, and <a href="Amanda_Merrill" title="wikilink">Amanda Merrill</a>, a <a href="New_Hampshire_Senate" title="wikilink">New Hampshire State Senator</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> He is also a <a href="second_cousin" title="wikilink">second cousin</a> of former <a href="Lehman_Brothers" title="wikilink">Lehman Brothers</a> CEO <a href="Dick_Fuld" title="wikilink">Dick Fuld</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>He got his start playing baseball hitting <a href="wiffle_ball" title="wikilink">wiffle balls</a> with his grandmother when he was three years old.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Instead of carrying around the typical teddy bear or worn-down baby blanket when he was young, he carried a book of baseball stats with him all the time, like a security blanket.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> &quot;He was only 5 or 6 and he was already computing <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">batting averages</a> and <a href="Earned_run_average" title="wikilink">ERAs</a>,&quot; his father said. &quot;He'd sit in the bathtub, and I'd say 'If a guy goes 17-for-37, what's his batting average?' What struck me is that he'd perform these operations in very creative ways&lt;U+2013&gt;not just that he got the right answer, but his methodology, adding in a factor and then dividing by 10, etc. I'd watch him and say 'wow,' just like I said 'wow' when he used to hit.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Shorter than most major leaguers, Fuld says: &quot;When I realized I was going to be limited physically, I looked for guys in the big leagues who were little. I'd buy baseball cards and find anyone under 5&lt;U+2013&gt;10 who played in the outfield, and say, 'That's my guy; there's hope.'&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Despite his size, by the time he was 12 years old, Fuld was competing in a league of 14- to 16-year-olds.</p>
<p>In June 2009, Fuld married his high school sweetheart, Sarah. He had met her while they were fellow students at <a href="Phillips_Exeter_Academy" title="wikilink">Phillips Exeter Academy</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> She is an athlete as well, and won two national lacrosse championships playing for Princeton University.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="diabetes">Diabetes</h2>

<p>Fuld was diagnosed with <a href="diabetes_mellitus_type_1" title="wikilink">Type 1 diabetes</a> when he was 10 years old. He recalled, &quot;I was losing weight, I was thirsty all the time, just classic symptoms, so my parents knew something was wrong and the doctor diagnosed it right away. It was tough, but when I realized there was no other alternative, I just looked at it as a challenge.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>At the age of 12, he met pitcher <a href="Bill_Gullickson" title="wikilink">Bill Gullickson</a>, who also had diabetes, and talked to him for two minutes. &quot;That was enough to inspire me,&quot; Fuld said.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> &quot;Any time I can talk to young diabetic kids, I look forward to that opportunity,&quot; said Gullickson.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Former Cub All Star third baseman <a href="Ron_Santo" title="wikilink">Ron Santo</a> was also afflicted with Type 1 diabetes. Santo hid his ailment from others during his playing days, because he was afraid they would consider him weak.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Santo later had both his legs amputated, because of complications caused by his diabetes.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Now, at least six times a day Fuld opens a small black case, withdraws a <a href="glucometer" class="uri" title="wikilink">glucometer</a>, pricks a finger (&quot;It's pretty painless; I've got calloused fingers&quot;), and checks his <a href="blood_sugar" title="wikilink">blood sugar</a> (a 30-second process).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He does it whenever he feels he should check his blood sugar level, even if he is in the clubhouse or the dugout.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> He gives himself shots of <a href="insulin" class="uri" title="wikilink">insulin</a> at breakfast and dinner times.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Fuld is also comfortable handling the kidding in the clubhouse regarding his treatments. &quot;We dish it out pretty good about his insulin shots,&lt;U+201D&gt; said his AA manager <a href="Pat_Listach" title="wikilink">Pat Listach</a>. &quot;We always give him stuff about putting needles in the refrigerator, and shooting up in the clubhouse. He takes it all in stride. He&lt;U+2019&gt;s a good guy.&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Asked whether he thinks about his blood sugar level when he is chasing fly balls, he answered: &quot;For those brief moments, it's out of my mind. I get back to the dugout, and it definitely crosses my mind. 'OK, my face is intact &lt;U+2013&gt; what about my sugar?'&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="high-school">High school</h3>
<p>Fuld attended <a href="Berwick_Academy" title="wikilink">Berwick Academy</a> as an eighth grader, during which time the University of New Hampshire's baseball coach opined that he had the best batting swing of any player in the State. He then transferred to <a href="Phillips_Exeter_Academy" title="wikilink">Phillips Exeter Academy</a>, where he played baseball and soccer, and ran track.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Playing in New Hampshire, due to the chilly weather he was limited to short baseball seasons, and some of his games were played as it snowed.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Fuld batted .613 as a freshman, and .489 as a sophomore with 11 <a href="Stolen_base" title="wikilink">steals</a>. He led his club to a league title as a junior in 1999, as he batted .600 with 9 steals. As a senior he hit .550 with 6 <a href="homer" title="wikilink">homers</a>, 12 <a href="RBI" title="wikilink">RBIs</a>, and 13 stolen bases.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> He was a three-time team captain and four-time MVP of the varsity baseball team.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="college">College</h3>

<p>A total of 94 colleges approached Fuld after high school, and he chose to attend <a href="Stanford_University" title="wikilink">Stanford University</a>. He was an <a href="economics" class="uri" title="wikilink">economics</a> major there, ultimately graduating in 2004.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> He was a star, record-setting 4-year starter in center field for the Cardinals, the school's baseball team.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2001, as a freshman, he batted .357 as he established himself as the team's <a href="leadoff_hitter" title="wikilink">leadoff hitter</a>. Fuld was fifth in the Pacific-10 (<a href="Pac-10" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pac-10</a>) conference in runs scored (56), sixth in <a href="walk" title="wikilink">walks</a> (32), and ninth in hits (81). In the post-season he hit .396.

<p>As a sophomore in 2002, he led the Pac-10 in hits (110), breaking Stanford's single-season record, while batting .375, third-best in the conference.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Fuld also led the conference in total bases (162), was third in runs scored (67) and doubles (20), and fifth in <a href="triple_(baseball)" title="wikilink">triples</a> (4). He was named a First-Team (<em>ABCA</em>, <em>Baseball America</em>, <em>Baseball Weekly</em>) and Third-Team (<em>Collegiate Baseball</em>, NCBWA) All-American. He was also named a <em><a href="Jewish_Sports_Review" title="wikilink">Jewish Sports Review</a></em> College Baseball First Team All-American, along with future major leaguers <a href="Craig_Breslow" title="wikilink">Craig Breslow</a> and <a href="Adam_Greenberg_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Adam Greenberg</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> In addition, Fuld earned the Stanford Jack Shepard Memorial Award and Come Through Award. He batted .421 with two homers in four CWS games, earning a spot on the All-College World Series Team for the second straight year.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Fuld also played with <a href="Team_USA" title="wikilink">Team USA</a> in the summers of 2001 and 2002.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2003, Fuld was named a First-Team (NCBWA) and Third-Team (<em>Baseball America</em>) Pre-Season All-American. In the regular season, as a junior he tied the school season record for runs with 83 (# 1 in the Pac-10). He also hit .321 with 35 RBIs and 10 steals in 10 attempts, leading the conference in triples (9) while coming in fifth in hits (97), eighth in doubles (18) and total bases (145), and ninth in walks (34). In the post-season his 24 career hits broke the <a href="College_World_Series" title="wikilink">College World Series</a> record of 23 set by <a href="Keith_Moreland" title="wikilink">Keith Moreland</a> in 1973&lt;U+2013&gt;75.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> And commenting on his defense, Stanford coach <a href="Mark_Marquess" title="wikilink">Mark Marquess</a> said: &quot;If it's in the ballpark, he's going to catch it. He's the premier center fielder in college baseball.&quot;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> He earned All-Pac-10 honors for the third straight season. Reflecting on his college career, Fuld said: &quot;I think one of the things you take away from playing under Coach Marquess is whatever you do, be it baseball or anything else, you do it well and you do it with passion. You do it with excitement because, really, that's the way to go about things. Not only in sports, but beyond sports.&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>Fuld was drafted in the 24th round (703rd overall) of the <a href="2003_Major_League_Baseball_Draft" title="wikilink">2003 Draft</a> by the Chicago Cubs, but did not sign.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Marquess thought that Fuld might have been drafted relatively low because, as a 5' 10&quot; leadoff hitter, he did not fit the stereotype of a tall, power-hitting major league outfielder.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> But Fuld said of the Cub's bid: &quot;It was a generous offer. It was a tough choice.&quot;<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> He then batted .361 with 14 RBIs and 10 stolen bases in the summer of 2003 for the <a href="Hyannis_Mets" title="wikilink">Hyannis Mets</a> in the <a href="Cape_Cod_League" title="wikilink">Cape Cod League</a>, and was voted a Cape Cod League All Star.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>Before the 2004 season, Fuld was named a First-Team (NCBWA), Second-Team (<a href="Louisville_Slugger" title="wikilink">Louisville Slugger</a>),<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> and Third Team (<em>Baseball America</em>, <em>Collegiate Baseball</em>) Pre-season All-American, and an Honorable Mention Pac-10 All-Academic.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Diving for a ball in the outfield in his second-to-last game in college, he broke his shoulder, tore his <a href="torn_labrum" title="wikilink">labrum</a>, and partially tore his <a href="rotator_cuff" title="wikilink">rotator cuff</a>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a><a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> For the season, he received Honorable Mention to the Pac-10 All-Academic Team and All-Conference Team<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>When he became Stanford's and the Pac-10's all-time leader in runs scored (268), Fuld modestly said: &quot;It means a lot to break the record. Obviously, a record like that is more of a tribute to the teammates I've had over the last four years.&quot;<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> When he graduated Stanford, in addition he ranked among the school's all-time top 10 in hits (353; # 2), triples (16; # 3T), and doubles (58; # 6T).<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>Fuld said: &quot;I want to try my hand. It's been a lifelong dream, really, to play professional baseball. I just love it too much not to give it a shot.&quot;<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The Cubs drafted him for a second time, in the 10th round (306th overall) of the <a href="2004_Major_League_Baseball_Draft" title="wikilink">2004 Draft</a>, and this time Fuld signed.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> When he made it to the major leagues, he became the 78th former Stanford Cardinal to do so.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> During the baseball off-season, Fuld returns to Stanford to pursue a master's degree in statistics.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
