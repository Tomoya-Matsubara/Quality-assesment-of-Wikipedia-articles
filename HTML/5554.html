<h4 id="nebraska">Nebraska</h4>
<p>Glasgow enrolled at the <a href="University_of_Nebraska&lt;U+2013&gt;Lincoln" title="wikilink">University of Nebraska</a> in 1925.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> As a freshman at Nebraska, Glasgow saw that the <a href="Nebraska_Cornhuskers_football" title="wikilink">Cornhuskers</a> were emphasizing &quot;beef and brawn&quot; over &quot;speed and agility.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> At 5 feet, 8 inches, and 175 pounds, Glasgow concluded he would see more playing time elsewhere and transferred to the <a href="University_of_Iowa" title="wikilink">University of Iowa</a>.</p>
<h4 id="iowa">Iowa</h4>
<p>After sitting out the 1926 season following his transfer, Glasgow played three years each for <a href="Iowa_Hawkeyes_football" title="wikilink">Iowa's football</a> and baseball teams. As a baseball player, he played <a href="shortstop" class="uri" title="wikilink">shortstop</a> and won three <a href="varsity_letter" title="wikilink">varsity letters</a>. He was the starting shortstop and leading hitter of the 1927 Iowa baseball team that tied for the <a href="Big_Ten_Conference" title="wikilink">Big Ten Conference</a> championship.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> He gained his greatest acclaim playing at the <a href="Halfback_(American_football)" title="wikilink">halfback</a> position for Iowa's football team from 1927 to 1929. Glasgow was the football team's leading ground gainer three straight years, a record that has not been equaled.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In addition to his talent as a runner, Glasgow was also known as &quot;a deadly tackler while operating at <a href="Safety_(American_football_position)" title="wikilink">safety</a> in the old diamond defense.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He also handled <a href="Punter_(football)" title="wikilink">punting</a> and <a href="Placekicker" title="wikilink">place kicking</a> responsibilities for the Hawkeyes. Iowa coach <a href="Burt_Ingwersen" title="wikilink">Burt Ingwersen</a> later said of Glasgow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I think Bill's greatest attribute as a ball carrier was the fact that you could never run him out of bounds. When tacklers would corner him against the <a href="sidelines" class="uri" title="wikilink">sidelines</a>, he'd cut back, put his head down and let them have it. I'll never forget one game at Minnesota. He ran into a tackler so hard the poor Minnesota fellow got up and lined up in our <a href="backfield" class="uri" title="wikilink">backfield</a> on the next play.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="section">1927</h5>
<p>As a sophomore in 1927, Glasgow ran for three <a href="touchdown" title="wikilink">touchdowns</a> and kicked two <a href="extra_point" title="wikilink">extra points</a> in the second quarter of his first football game for the Hawkeyes, a 32–6 win over <a href="Monmouth_College" title="wikilink">Monmouth College</a>. His 20-point total in the second quarter against Monmouth remains an Iowa Hawkeyes record for scoring in a single quarter.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="section-1">1928</h5>
<p>As a junior in 1928, Glasgow helped lead Iowa to six straight victories, including a 14–7 win over <a href="1928_Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football_team" title="wikilink">Ohio State</a> in which Glasgow ran for 153 yards.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The 1928 team lost the Big Ten Conference championship after a 10–7 loss to <a href="1928_Michigan_Wolverines_football_team" title="wikilink">Michigan</a>, a game in which Iowa's only touchdown came on a 55-yard run by Glasgow.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Glasgow also gained acclaim in 1928 for his punting performance in Iowa's 7–6 win over a <a href="1928_Minnesota_Golden_Gophers_football_team" title="wikilink">Minnesota</a> team featuring <a href="Bronko_Nagurski" title="wikilink">Bronko Nagurski</a>. Glasgow's punting helped keep Minnesota from scoring in the first three quarters. In the fourth quarter, a long punt by Glasgow sailed high over the head of Minnesota's <a href="Frederick_L._Hovde" title="wikilink">Fred Hovde</a>, but Hovde ran back to the nine-yard line where he retrieved the punt and ran for a 91-yard touchdown. Glasgow was injured trying to catch Hovde.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> At the end of the 1928 season, Glasgow was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten and All-Western player.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> He placed fourth in the voting for the <a href="Chicago_Tribune_Silver_Football" title="wikilink">Chicago Tribune Silver Football</a> trophy as the most valuable player in the Big Ten Conference in 1928 and was elected by his teammates as the captain of the 1929 Iowa Hawkeyes football team.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In reporting on his election as Iowa's 1929 captain, one Iowa newspaper described his as the team's &quot;Dancing Master&quot;: &quot;Glasgow is commonly known as Iowa's Dancing master because of his shiftiness on the gridiron and because he is manager of the most popular ball room in Iowa City.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> At the end of the 1928 season, <em><a href="The_Des_Moines_Register" title="wikilink">The Des Moines Register</a></em> wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The new leader is something more than a <a href="triple_threat_man" title="wikilink">triple threat man</a>. His off-tackle dashes and ability in an open field are supplemented by his accomplishments as a place kicker, punter, and forward passer. Weighing only 160 pounds, Glasgow's 5 feet 9 inches of height ranked him as one of the shortest men on the squad. He was apparently immune to injury, and despite the fact that he was the target of every defense the Hawkeyes encountered, he almost never called for time out.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="section-2">1929</h5>
<p>As a senior in 1929, Glasgow gained further acclaim as the captain of a football team that permitted its opponents to score only 28 points all season. Despite the low-scoring by opponents, the Hawkeyes finished with a record of 4–2–2. On October 5, 1929, Glasgow scored the first touchdown in Iowa's new football stadium, now known as <a href="Kinnick_Stadium" title="wikilink">Kinnick Stadium</a>, on a 31-yard run.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> He also scored the first touchdown in the official dedication game against the <a href="Illinois_Fighting_Illini_football" title="wikilink">University of Illinois</a>. In the Illinois game, Glasgow ran for a 78-yard touchdown on the first play from scrimmage.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The touchdown was Iowa's only score in a 7–7 tie game against Illinois. Glasgow wore a protective face mask in the 1929 Illinois game (<em>pictured above</em>) to protect a broken cheek bone suffered in an earlier game.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Glasgow also kicked a game-winning field goal in Iowa's 9–7 win over <a href="1929_Minnesota_Golden_Gophers_football_team" title="wikilink">Minnesota</a> on November 9, 1929.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>The Iowa football program became embroiled in scandal late in the 1929 season. After an investigation revealed a slush fund used to pay football players, Iowa was banned from the Big Ten Conference. Following a 7–0 loss to <a href="Purdue_Boilermakers_football" title="wikilink">Purdue</a>, sports writer Irving Vaughn praised Glasgow in the <em><a href="Chicago_Tribune" title="wikilink">Chicago Tribune</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If Iowa needs any consolation for its failure to create more havoc in the Big Ten circle from which it is to be banished, it can find it quite easily. Hawkeyes have Capt. Bill Glasgow. No halfback ever revealed himself in a brighter light. He ran off the tackles, he ripped into the line and he passed. He literally carried almost the entire Purdue team with him at times. When tougher and more willing backs are built, they will have to make the model from the stocky lad from Shenandoah, Iowa.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the conclusion of the <a href="1929_college_football_season" title="wikilink">1929 college football season</a>, Glasgow was selected as a first-team <a href="1929_College_Football_All-America_Team" title="wikilink">All-American</a> by <a href="Grantland_Rice" title="wikilink">Grantland Rice</a> for <em><a href="Collier&#39;s_Weekly" title="wikilink">Collier's Weekly</a></em>,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> the Newspaper Editors Association (based on a poll of 100 coaches and football writers),<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> <em><a href="The_New_York_Sun" title="wikilink">The New York Sun</a></em>,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> and sports writer Lawrence Perry.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> He was also named the outstanding back in the country by <em>The New York Sun</em> and received the <a href="Chicago_Tribune_Silver_Football" title="wikilink">Chicago Tribune Silver Football</a> trophy as the most valuable player in the <a href="Big_Ten_Conference" title="wikilink">Big Ten Conference</a>. Glasgow was also honored by being selected to play for the East team in the 1930 <a href="East-West_Shrine_Game" title="wikilink">East-West Shrine Game</a>. He scored one of the East's touchdowns in a 19–7 win but also suffered a shoulder injury in the Shrine Game that hampered his professional baseball career.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>In four years of football at Iowa, Glasgow was credited with running for 1,424 yards on 364 attempts for an average of four yards per attempt. He scored a total of 80 points for the Hawkeyes on 10 touchdowns 17 extra points, and one field goal. He successfully converted 17 out of 22 extra point kicks.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>At the end of 1929, officials of the University of Iowa athletic department selected Glasgow as one of the 12 greatest Iowa athletes of all time in all sports.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Glasgow graduated from Iowa with a bachelor of arts degree in 1930.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="professional-athlete">Professional athlete</h3>
<p>In January 1930, Branch Rickey signed Glasgow to a contract to play professional baseball for the <a href="St._Louis_Cardinals" title="wikilink">St. Louis Cardinals</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Glasgow attended spring training with the Cardinals but was released to the minor leagues at the end of March 1929.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> He played in 1930 for the Cardinals' Western League club in <a href="St._Joseph,_Missouri" title="wikilink">St. Joseph, Missouri</a> and also for the team in <a href="Moline,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Moline, Illinois</a>.

<h3 id="legal-career">Legal career</h3>
<p>Glasgow attended law school at the <a href="University_of_Iowa_College_of_Law" title="wikilink">University of Iowa College of Law</a> while playing professional football, using the money he earned in the NFL to pay for his legal education.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> During the 1932 college football season, Glasgow was asked to serve as an assistant coach at Iowa under head coach <a href="Ossie_Solem" title="wikilink">Ossie Solem</a>. Glasgow was in his final year of law school at the time and sought the extra remuneration to pay his expenses. However, the Big Ten at the time had a rule that prevented players who had played professional football from obtaining coaching positions at Big Ten schools. Glasgow applied to the conference for reinstatement of his amateur status, but the application was denied.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
