<p><strong>Warwick Castle</strong> ( ) is a medieval <a href="castle" class="uri" title="wikilink">castle</a> developed from an original built by <a href="William_I_of_England" title="wikilink">William the Conqueror</a> in 1068. <a href="Warwick" class="uri" title="wikilink">Warwick</a> is the <a href="county_town" title="wikilink">county town</a> of <a href="Warwickshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Warwickshire</a>, England, situated on a bend of the <a href="River_Avon,_Warwickshire" title="wikilink">River Avon</a>. The original wooden <a href="motte-and-bailey" class="uri" title="wikilink">motte-and-bailey</a> castle was rebuilt in stone in the 12th century. During the <a href="Hundred_Years_War" title="wikilink">Hundred Years War</a>, the facade opposite the town was refortified, resulting in one of the most recognisable examples of 14th century military architecture. It was used as a <a href="stronghold" class="uri" title="wikilink">stronghold</a> until the early 17th century, when it was granted to <a href="Fulke_Greville,_1st_Baron_Brooke" title="wikilink">Sir Fulke Greville</a> by <a href="James_I" title="wikilink">James I</a> in 1604. Greville converted it to a <a href="country_house" title="wikilink">country house</a> and it was owned by the Greville family, who became earls of Warwick in 1759, until 1978 when it was bought by <a href="the_Tussauds_Group" title="wikilink">the Tussauds Group</a>.</p>

The river, which runs below the castle on the east side, has eroded the rock the castle stands on, forming a cliff. The river and cliff form natural defences. When construction began in 1068, four houses belonging to the <a href="History_of_Coventry#Early_history" title="wikilink">Abbot of Coventry</a> were demolished to provide room. The castle's position made it strategically important in safeguarding the Midlands against rebellion.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> During the 12th century, King <a href="Henry_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry I</a> was suspicious of <a href="Roger_de_Beaumont,_2nd_Earl_of_Warwick" title="wikilink">Roger de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Warwick</a>.

<p>An Anglo-Saxon <a href="burh" class="uri" title="wikilink">burh</a> was established on the site in 914; with fortifications instigated by <a href="Ethelfleda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ethelfleda</a>, daughter of <a href="Alfred_the_Great" title="wikilink">Alfred the Great</a>. The burh she established was one of ten which defended <a href="Mercia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mercia</a> against the marauding <a href="Danes_(Germanic_tribe)" title="wikilink">Danes</a>. Its position allowed it to dominate the <a href="Fosse_Way" title="wikilink">Fosse Way</a>, as well as the river valley and the crossing over the River Avon. Though the motte to the south-west of the present castle is now called &quot;Ethelfleda's Mound&quot;, it is in fact part of the later Norman fortifications, and not of Anglo-Saxon origin.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

In the case of Warwick, the least recorded of the 11 urban castles in the <a href="Domesday_Book" title="wikilink">1086 survey</a>, four houses were torn down to make way for the castle.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> A motte-and-bailey castle consists of a mound &lt;U+2013&gt; on which usually stands a <a href="keep" class="uri" title="wikilink">keep</a> or tower &lt;U+2013&gt; and a bailey, which is an enclosed courtyard.

<p>In 1153, the wife of Roger de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Warwick, was tricked into believing that her husband was dead, and surrendered control of the castle to the invading army of Henry of Anjou, later King Henry II.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> According to the <em><a href="Deeds_of_King_Stephen" title="wikilink">Gesta Regis Stephani</a></em>, a 12th-century historical text, Roger de Beaumont died on hearing the news that his wife had handed over the castle.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Henry later returned the castle to the Earls of Warwick as they had been supporters of his mother, <a href="Empress_Matilda" title="wikilink">Empress Matilda</a>, in <a href="The_Anarchy" title="wikilink">The Anarchy</a> of 1135&lt;U+2013&gt;54.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>From 1088, the castle had traditionally belonged to the <a href="Earl_of_Warwick" title="wikilink">Earl of Warwick</a>, and it served as a symbol of his power. The castle was taken in 1153 by <a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry of Anjou</a>, later Henry II. It has been used to hold prisoners, including some from the <a href="Battle_of_Poitiers_(1356)" title="wikilink">Battle of Poitiers</a> in the 14th century. Under the ownership of <a href="Richard_Neville,_16th_Earl_of_Warwick" title="wikilink">Richard Neville</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; also known as &quot;Warwick the Kingmaker&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; Warwick Castle was used in the 15th century to imprison the English king, <a href="Edward_IV_of_England" title="wikilink">Edward IV</a>.</p>

This new <a href="archaeological_phase" title="wikilink">phase</a> took the form of a shell keep with all the buildings constructed against the <a href="Curtain_wall_(fortification)" title="wikilink">curtain wall</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> During the <a href="Revolt_of_1173&lt;U+2013&gt;1174" title="wikilink">barons' rebellion of 1173&lt;U+2013&gt;74</a>, the Earl of Warwick remained loyal to King Henry II, and the castle was used to store provisions.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The castle and the lands associated with the earldom passed down in the Beaumont family until 1242.

After the death of William Mauduit in 1267, the title and castle passed to his nephew <a href="William_de_Beauchamp,_9th_Earl_of_Warwick" title="wikilink">William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick</a>. Following William's death, Warwick Castle passed through seven generations of the Beauchamp family, who over the next 180 years were responsible for most of the additions made to the castle.

<p>The facade overlooking the river was designed as a symbol of the power and wealth of the Beauchamp earls and would have been &quot;of minimal defensive value&quot;; this followed a trend of 14th-century castles being more statements of power than designed exclusively for military use.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

Neville attempted to rule in the king's name;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> however, constant protests by the king's supporters forced the Earl to release the king.

Warwick Castle then passed from Neville to his son-in-law, <a href="George_Plantagenet,_1st_Duke_of_Clarence" title="wikilink">George Plantagenet</a>. George Plantagenet was executed in 1478 and his lands passed onto <a href="Edward_Plantagenet,_17th_Earl_of_Warwick" title="wikilink">Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick</a>; however, Edward Plantagenet was only two when his father died so his lands were taken in the custody of <a href="The_Crown" title="wikilink">The Crown</a>.

<p>While in the care of The Crown, Warwick Castle underwent repairs and renovations using about 500 loads of stone. The castle, as well as lands associated with the earldom, was in Crown care from 1478 until 1547, when they were granted to <a href="John_Dudley,_1st_Duke_of_Northumberland" title="wikilink">John Dudley</a> with the second creation of the title the Earl of Warwick.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> When making his appeal for ownership of the castle Dudley said of the castle's condition: &quot;... the castle of its self is not able to lodge a good baron with his train, for all the one side of the said castle with also the dungeon tower is clearly ruinated and down to the ground&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

The 8th Baron Brooke was also bestowed with the title Earl of Warwick in 1759, the fourth creation of the title. With the recreation of the title, the castle was back in the ownership of the earls of Warwick. <a href="Daniel_Garrett" title="wikilink">Daniel Garrett</a>'s work at Warwick is documented in 1748; <a href="Howard_Colvin" title="wikilink">Howard Colvin</a> attributed to him the <a href="Gothic_Revival" title="wikilink">Gothick</a> interior of the Chapel.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> <a href="Lancelot_Brown" title="wikilink">Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown</a> had been on hand since 1749.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Brown, who was still head gardener at Stowe at the time and had yet to make his reputation as the main exponent of the <a href="English_landscape_garden" title="wikilink">English landscape garden</a>, was called in by Lord Brooke to give Warwick Castle a more &quot;natural&quot; connection to its river. Brown simplified the long narrow stretch by sweeping it into a lawn that dropped right to the riverbank, stopped at each end by bold clumps of native trees. A serpentine drive gave an impression of greater distance between the front gates and the castle entrance.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Horace_Walpole" title="wikilink">Horace Walpole</a> saw Brown's maturing scheme in 1751 and remarked in a letter: &quot;The castle is enchanting.

<p>In 1754 the poet <a href="Thomas_Gray" title="wikilink">Thomas Gray</a>, a member of Walpole's Gothicising circle, commented disdainfully on the activity at the castle:</p>

<p>Gray's mention of Argyle Buildings, Westminster, London,<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> elicited a connotation of an inappropriately modern Georgian urban development, for the buildings in Argyll Street were a speculation to designs of <a href="James_Gibbs" title="wikilink">James Gibbs</a>, 1736&lt;U+2013&gt;40.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

<p>Individuals had been visiting the castle since the end of the 17th century<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> and this grew in importance through the 19th century.

<h2 id="owners">Owners</h2>

<p>Over its 950 years of history Warwick Castle has been owned by 36 different individuals, plus four periods as crown property under seven different monarchs. It was the family seat of three separate creations of the Earls of Warwick, and has been a family home for members of the Beaumont, Beauchamp, Neville, Plantagenet, Dudley and Greville families. The first creation of the Earldom specifically included the right of inheritance through the female line, so the castle three times had a woman (or girl) as the owner. Eleven of the owners were under 20 when they inherited, including a girl aged two and a boy aged three. At least three owners died in battle, two were executed and one murdered. Every century except the 21st has seen major building work or adaptations at the castle.</p>
