<p>The School can trace its origins to 1871 when <a href="John_Ruskin" title="wikilink">John Ruskin</a> founded a drawing school in the University Galleries (subsequently the <a href="Ashmolean_Museum_of_Art_and_Archaeology" title="wikilink">Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology</a>) to encourage artisanship and technical skills. The Ruskin remained at the Ashmolean until 1974 when it moved to 74 <a href="High_Street,_Oxford" title="wikilink">High Street</a>. It also occupies a further building at 128 Bullingdon Road.</p>
<p>The School was originally called the Ruskin School of Drawing. Fine Art was added as a discrete focus in 1945.</p>
