<p><strong>&quot;Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t&quot; (040/041)</strong> (lit. Karl-equipment) was a <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> German <a href="self-propelled" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-propelled</a> siege <a href="howitzer" class="uri" title="wikilink">howitzer</a>. It is notable as the largest self-propelled weapon ever built<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. It was used to attack the Soviet fortresses of <a href="Brest_Fortress" title="wikilink">Brest-Litovsk</a> and <a href="Siege_of_Sevastopol_(1941&lt;U+2013&gt;1942)" title="wikilink">Sevastopol</a>, bombarded Polish rebels in <a href="Warsaw_Uprising" title="wikilink">Warsaw</a> and participated in the <a href="Battle_of_the_Bulge" title="wikilink">Battle of the Bulge</a> and the attacks against the <a href="Ludendorff_Bridge" title="wikilink">Remagen Bridgehead</a>. Only one survivor exists today.</p>

<p>In March 1936 Rheinmetall made a proposal for a super-heavy howitzer to attack the <a href="Maginot_Line" title="wikilink">Maginot Line</a>. The initial concept was for a weapon that would be transported by several tracked vehicles and assembled on site, but the lengthy preparation time drove Rheinmetall to change it to a self-propelled weapon in January 1937. Extensive driving trials took place in 1938 and 1939 using the Neubau Fahrzeug No. 1 and a scale model to investigate the extremely high ground pressure and steering such an enormous vehicle. The full-scale driving trials were held at <a href="Unterl&lt;U+00FC&gt;ss" class="uri" title="wikilink">Unterl&lt;U+00FC&gt;ss</a> in May 1940. Firing trials took place in June 1939.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Delivery of the six production vehicles took place from November 1940 to August 1941.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> General <a href="Karl_Becker_(general)" title="wikilink">Karl Becker</a> of the Artillery was involved in the development, from whom the huge weapon gained its nickname.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In total, seven Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te guns were manufactured. The first six had the nicknames &quot;Adam&quot;, &quot;Eva&quot;, &quot;Thor&quot;, &quot;Odin&quot;, &quot;Loki&quot;, and &quot;Ziu&quot;; the seventh, the research and test weapon, had no name. In February 1941, discussions commenced concerning increasing the range of the weapon, and in May 1942, 54 cm barrels <em>(Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t 041)</em> were ordered for the six vehicles. At a conference with Hitler in March 1943 it was stated that the first 54 cm <em>Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t 041</em> would be delivered by June 1943, and the third, by mid-August. Only three of the 54 cm barrels were completed and they could be mounted on Nos. I, IV and V<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, although any model could be converted to use the smaller weapon. Twenty-two <a href="Panzer_IV" title="wikilink">Panzer IV</a> Ausf. D, E and F chassis were modified with a superstructure capable of carrying four shells that replaced the turret and outfitted with a crane as <em>Munitionsschlepper</em> ammunition transporters/loaders.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Two or three of these <em>Munitionsschlepper</em> were assigned to each weapon.</p>

For longer distances the <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t</em> was disassembled using a special  crane into seven loads. The chassis was loaded onto a six-axle Culemeyer-Strassenfahrzeug lowboy trailer. The other parts of the gun were lighter and used four-axle trailers. If the trailer with the chassis on board had to cross a bridge that couldn't carry their combined weight the chassis had to be off-loaded and driven across under its own power.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The weapon was moved long distances via rail on a variant of a <a href="Schnabel_car" title="wikilink">Schnabel car</a>; the whole chassis was hung between two huge pedestal-mounted swiveling arms fixed to five-axle <a href="bogies" class="uri" title="wikilink">bogies</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> When it reached its destination, the weapon was detached from its supporting arms, driven to its intended firing location, then the chassis was lowered to the ground to distribute the recoil forces more evenly in preparation for firing. The <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t</em> proved to have no problems moving over normal soil, but under no circumstances was it allowed to make turns on soft soil lest it throw a track. The chassis had to be backed into position to fire, which expedited movement to a new position, but the firing position had to be precisely leveled and the approach route prepared ahead of time to fill in soft spots and any ditches, etc.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> It could only be loaded at zero elevation, so it had to be re-aimed between every shot.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>The various <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te</em> used two different types of transmissions, engines and suspension system. The table below outlines how each vehicle was outfitted. After May 1944 the gasoline engines were replaced by diesels. Little information is available for No. VII, the experimental model, and the data below must be regarded as unconfirmed.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="section">1941</h3>
<p>On 3 January 1941 <em>schwere Batterie 833</em> was created at the Bergen training ground and ordered to be combat ready by 15 February 1941. On 2 April 1941 it was expanded into <em>schwere Artillerie Batallion (Heavy Artillery Battalion) 833</em>. The original <em>Batterie 833</em> was redesignated as the first battery of the new battalion and a new second battery was formed, each battery having two M&lt;U+00F6&gt;rsers, with orders to be combat ready by 1 May 1941 in preparation for <a href="Operation_Barbarossa" title="wikilink">Operation Barbarossa</a>. Initially a single battery was to be deployed against the Soviet fortress at <a href="Brest_Fortress" title="wikilink">Brest-Litovsk</a>, but that was changed by 14 May 1941 when the other battery was to ordered to attack the Soviet border fortifications near <a href="Lviv" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lviv</a>. The <em>First Battery</em> was assigned to <em>IV Army Corps</em> of <em><a href="17th_Army_(Germany)" title="wikilink">17th Army</a></em> of <em><a href="Army_Group_South" title="wikilink">Army Group South</a></em> near <a href="Lviv" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lviv</a> while <em>Second Battery</em> was ordered to support the attack by the <em><a href="4th_Army_(Germany)" title="wikilink">4th Army</a></em> of <em><a href="Army_Group_Center" title="wikilink">Army Group Center</a></em> against the <a href="Brest_Fortress" title="wikilink">Brest Fortress</a>. The batteries were issued 60 and 36 rounds respectively.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Little is known of <em>First Battery's</em> operations except that <em>IV Army Corps</em> reported on 23 June that the battery was no longer needed and was no longer operational due to technical deficiencies. <em>Second Battery's</em> weapons had some assembly problems, issues with the electrical firing mechanism and non-standard ammunition, not surprising for the <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t</em>'s combat debut, but managed to fire 31 of their 36 rounds by the 24th of June. It was ordered home that day by <em><a href="Army_Group_Center" title="wikilink">Army Group Center</a></em> where the battalion was ordered to reform with eight <a href="21_cm_Mrs_18" title="wikilink">21 cm M&lt;U+00F6&gt;rser 18</a> howitzers on 6 August 1941.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="section-1">1942</h3>
<p>In preparation for the <a href="Siege_of_Sevastopol_(1941&lt;U+2013&gt;1942)" title="wikilink">attack on Sevastopol</a> scheduled for the early summer <em>schwere Artillerie-Abteilung 833</em> was ordered to form a <em>Karl-Batterie</em> with three M&lt;U+00F6&gt;rsers on 18 February 1942. Camouflaged firing positions  long,  wide and  deep had to be dug for each howitzer to minimize Soviet counter-fire before they could move into position. On 20 May 1942 <em><a href="11th_Army_(Germany)" title="wikilink">11th Army</a></em> reported all three <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te</em> were at the front with a total of 72 s. Betongranate (anti-concrete shells) and 50 le. Betongranate. <em>LIV Army Corps</em> reported that 19 s. Betongranate were fired between 2 and 6 June, 54 on 7 June and all 50 light shells between 8 and 13 June. More shells (29 schwere and 50 leichte) shipped to the battery before the end of the month. All 50 light shells were fired on 30 June and 25 heavy shells the following day. Many of these shells were fired at the two  twin-gun armored turrets of the <em>Maxim Gorkii</em> coast defense battery<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>, although shells fired at the turrets had little effect other than to jam one of the turrets and possibly knock out electrical power to the turrets, both of which were repaired without too much trouble. They did rather more damage to the concrete structure supporting the turrets as well as the command center located some 600 meters away (called the <em>Bastion</em> by the Germans). On 19 July 1942 the battery was ordered to ship their weapons to <a href="Hillersleben" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hillersleben</a> for refurbishment.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>On 7 July 1942 <em>schwere Artillerie-Abteilung 833</em> was ordered to form a new battery with one or two <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te</em>. This was done by 15 August as <em>schwere Batterie 628 (Karl)</em> with two weapons, although sufficient personnel to man three guns was to be furnished by <em>schwere Artillerie-Abteilung 833</em>. On 22 July OKH issued an order to send the batterie to <em><a href="Army_Group_North" title="wikilink">Army Group North</a></em> to support its planned offensive, <em>Unternehmen Georg</em>, against <a href="Siege_of_Leningrad" title="wikilink">Leningrad</a>. The order for <em>Unternehmen Georg</em>, dated 22 August, specified <em>Batterie 628</em> with three guns, presumably with two operational guns and one in reserve. <em>Army Group North</em> reported the batterie's arrival on 1 and 2 September 1942, but the Soviets preempted <em>Georg</em> with heavy attacks against the German forces besieging Leningrad so the <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te</em> didn't get into action.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>On 18 October OKH ordered the <em><a href="11th_Army_(Germany)" title="wikilink">11th Army</a></em> to transfer the batterie as soon as possible to <a href="Leipzig" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leipzig</a>, but the <em>11th Army</em> asked to retain it to use in a new version of <em>Georg</em> to begin later that month. <em>Georg</em> was again postponed in late October, and later canceled. A new attack, code-named <em>Feuerzauber</em> (Fire Magic), was planned in which the batterie was to participate, but it, too, was canceled after the Soviet encirclement of the German forces attacking <a href="Battle_of_Stalingrad" title="wikilink">Stalingrad</a>. OKH finally ordered the return home of the batterie on 4 December 1942 when it was clear that it had no mission.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="section-2">1943</h3>
<p>OKH issued orders to create a schwere Artillerie-Abteilung (Karl) on 4 May 1943 using the vehicles and equipment of <em>schwere Artillerie Batterie 628</em>. This became the first battery of the new battalion while the other battery was raised from scratch on 15 May as was the battalion Stab (Headquarters). Each battery had two <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te</em> plus a fifth in reserve. <em><a href="18th_Army_(Germany)" title="wikilink">18th Army</a></em> of <em>Army Group North</em> had plans to use one <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t</em> against the <a href="Oranienbaum_Bridgehead" title="wikilink">Oranienbaum Bridgehead</a> west of Leningrad during the summer of 1943, but the battalion was ordered to return the <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te</em> to Leipzig on 8 August. Just like the 833rd the battalion was ordered to reform with eight <a href="21_cm_Mrs_18" title="wikilink">21 cm M&lt;U+00F6&gt;rser 18</a> howitzers on <a href="29_August" title="wikilink">29 August</a> 1943 with effect by 10 September. A <em>Kommando f&lt;U+00FC&gt;r Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te</em> was formed on that same date as caretakers for the weapons. This was redesignated <em>Kommando f&lt;U+00FC&gt;r Sonder-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t des schwere Artillerie-Abteilung (mot.) 628 (Unit for Special-Equipment of heavy Artillery Battalion (motorized) 628)</em> on 2 June 1944.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="section-3">1944</h3>
<p>On 13 August 1944 a battery was ordered to be created immediately with one 54 cm <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t</em> and sent to the <em><a href="9th_Army_(Germany)" title="wikilink">9th Army</a></em> to help it suppress the <a href="Warsaw_Uprising" title="wikilink">Warsaw Uprising</a>. The next day the <em>Kommando f&lt;U+00FC&gt;r Sonder-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te</em> formed the <em>Heeres-Artillerie Batterie (bodenst&lt;U+00E4&gt;ndige) 638 (Army Artillery Battery (Static))</em> with 60 cm <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t</em> Nr. VI since no 54 cm weapon was available and a firing table hadn't yet been computed. It arrived at the Warsaw West train station at 0700 on 17 August 1944, although the ammunition train didn't arrive until the following morning.</p>
<p>On 24 August OKH noted that it had been very successful in combat and ordered another <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t</em> sent to Warsaw. A second battery, numbered 428, was formed 2 days later by the <em>Kommando f&lt;U+00FC&gt;r Sonder-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te</em>, but it didn't arrive at the Warsaw West train station until 1257 on 7 September 1944. A third <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t 040</em> was shipped to Warsaw on 10 September and incorporated into <em>H.Art.Bttr. (bo.) 428</em>. <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t</em> Nr. VI needed repairs and was shipped on 22 September back to <a href="J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog" class="uri" title="wikilink">J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog</a>. At some point a fourth <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t</em> was shipped to Warsaw as it was reported as operational on 25 September.</p>
<h4 id="status-report-29-september-1944">Status Report 29 September 1944</h4>

<p><em>Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. II:</em> Only set up as 040. Currently being overhauled in <a href="J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog" class="uri" title="wikilink">J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog</a>. Motor installation will be completed in about 14 days.</p>
<p><em>Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. III:</em> About 14 days ago the gun tube blew apart while test firing. Only about 50% is reusable. Hitler has decided that this <em>Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t</em> is to be restored to full operating condition. However, the schedule for restoring it isn't known.</p>
<p><em>Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. IV:</em> Set up for both 040 and 041. Currently equipped as 040 with <em>Batterie 428</em>.</p>
<p><em>Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. V:</em> Set up for both 040 and 041. Equipped as a 040, it will be sent to <em>Batterie 638</em> in <a href="Budapest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Budapest</a>.</p>
<p><em>Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. VI:</em> Only set up as 040. Came back from employment in Warsaw. Repairs will be completed in about 20 days.</p>
<p><em>Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. VII:</em> Versuschsger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t 041 (Research equipment for the 041 weapon) Currently with the Waffenamt for test firing and obtaining firing table data. It is not currently operational because important components (engine) are being overhauled and won't be operational before April 1945.</p>
<p><strong>2. Guns</strong></p>
<p>Six  041 guns have been ordered. Three have been completed and are stored in J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog. A decision on the other three is requested because delivery will take at least 14 months.</p>
<p><strong>3. 35 ton Crane</strong> <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te</em> can only be employed when each battery has a 35 ton crane. Two are in service, one is in J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog without its trailer, which was destroyed by fire.</p>
<p><img src="KarlonCulemeyer.jpg" title="fig:A Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t ready for road transport aboard its Culemeyer trailer" alt="A Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t ready for road transport aboard its Culemeyer trailer" /> <strong>4. Culemeyer-Strassenfahrzeuge</strong> Each battery needs one complete set of these heavy transport trailers. The two sets in service are set up for 040. Three 16-wheel trailers set up for 040 are available. Another 24-wheel trailer must be acquired to employ any additional <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te</em>.</p>
<p><strong>5. <em>Munitionsschlepper</em></strong> 13 total, of which 6 are with <em>Batteries 428</em> and <em>638</em>, 2 with Waffenamt for 040, 2 converted to 041 and 2 available.</p>
<p><strong>6. Ammunition</strong> a. Munition 040: 264 shells are immediately available, of which 150 are planned to be allotted to Batterie 638. Another 96 will be completed in the next few days. 241 round are in Unterluss to change their high explosive filler. About 10 completed daily. Part of the cartridges must be reworked. Powder testing will occur on 5 October so that the rest of the ammunition can be refilled.</p>
<p>b. Munition 041: 50 Betongranaten have been delivered to Hillersleben to be shot for firing table data in early October. 25 Betongranaten will still be delivered by the end of September, another 25 by the end of October, from then on 50 per month are planned. 50 Sprenggranaten are to be completed for firing table data in November. In early 1945 a total of 60 rounds of Spreng- and Betongranaten are to be produced monthly.</p>
<p>Three days later <em>H.Art.Bttr. 638</em> was ordered to transfer to Budapest and was loaded without any <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t</em>. Nr. V was rerouted to Budapest to equip the battery. <em>H.Art.Bttr. 428</em> followed on 10-11 October 1944. Both batteries were ordered back to Warsaw on 19 October, although they didn't arrive until 28 October. On 6 November H.Art.Bttr. 638 transferred one <em>Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t 040</em> to <em>H.Art.Bttr. 428</em> and returned to J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog on 10 November to rearm with a <em>Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te 041</em>. <em>H.Art.Bttr. 428</em> didn't remain near Warsaw much longer and departed for J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog itself on 15 November.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Batterie 428</em> exchanged its guns for Nr. II and VI (both with <em>Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te 040</em>) and departed for the West on 14 December 1944 to participate in <em>Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein</em> (Operation Watch on the Rhine), which would be known by Americans as the <a href="Battle_of_the_Bulge" title="wikilink">Battle of the Bulge</a>, but didn't reach the front until 29 December. <em>Batterie 628</em> followed on 20 December after equipping with Nr. IV, the first 54 cm Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t 041 to be committed to battle.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="section-4">1945</h3>
<p>Little is known of their activities during the battle, but Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. II was damaged enroute by a bomb and was back in J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog on 6 January 1945. It was repaired using parts from Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. I by 3 February. Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. IV was damaged by a number of penetrating hits and arrived in J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog on 31 January. Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. VI was still at the front on 19 January. In the meantime Nr. V was converted to use the 54 cm howitzer and had its engine rebuilt.</p>
<p><em>Batterie 628</em> was initially ordered to the Vistula Front on 7 March, but this was countermanded on 11 March and the Batterie was sent west to the Remagen area. The OKW war diary reported that 14 rounds were fired at the <a href="Ludendorff_Bridge" title="wikilink">Remagen Bridgehead</a> on 20 March 1945. <em>Batterie 428</em> was also ordered west on 11 March, but was to serve in the <a href="1st_Army_(Germany)" title="wikilink">1st Army</a> sector.</p>
<p>A status report dated 22 March showed Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te Nr. I and IV were still at J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog, with Nr. I configured as a 040 and Nr. IV to be completed as a 041. Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te Nr. II and V had left for the front on 11 and 10 March respectively. Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t VI was returning to J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog with engine damage. Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t III had been virtually destroyed and only the gun <a href="breech" class="uri" title="wikilink">breech</a> was salvageable. Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t VII needed parts and wasn't going to be made operational anytime soon.</p>
<p><em>Batterie 628</em> was ordered disbanded on 11 April and its personnel incorporated into <em>Batterie 428</em>, although it's unlikely that either unit actually saw action except in local defense.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="fate">Fate</h2>

II (&quot;Eva&quot;) as well as Nr. V (&quot;Loki&quot;) were captured by US forces in the period 21 March to 11 April 1945. Nr. VII (experimental chassis) was captured by the US Army in Hillersleben and later shipped to <a href="Aberdeen_Proving_Grounds" title="wikilink">Aberdeen Proving Grounds</a> but later scrapped.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Nr. VI (&quot;Ziu&quot;)was captured by the <a href="Red_Army" title="wikilink">Red Army</a>, probably at <a href="J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog" class="uri" title="wikilink">J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog</a> on 20 April 1945. This is on display at Kubinka, although marked as Nr. I (&quot;Adam&quot;).<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Nr. IV (&quot;Odin&quot;) was also captured by the Red Army. The fate of guns Nr. I (&quot;Adam&quot;) and Nr. III (&quot;Thor&quot;) are not known. It is probable both were captured by the Red Army in J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog.</p>
