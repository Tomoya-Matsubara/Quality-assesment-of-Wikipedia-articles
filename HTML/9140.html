<p><strong>Corfu</strong> (, <em>K&lt;U+00E9&gt;rkyra</em>, ; ; ; ) is a <a href="Greece" title="wikilink">Greek</a> <a href="list_of_islands_of_Greece" title="wikilink">island</a> in the <a href="Ionian_Sea" title="wikilink">Ionian Sea</a>. It is the second largest of the <a href="Ionian_Islands" title="wikilink">Ionian Islands</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The island is part of the <a href="Corfu_(peripheral_unit)" title="wikilink">Corfu peripheral unit</a>, and is administered as a single municipality. The municipality includes the island Corfu and the smaller islands <a href="Ereikoussa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ereikoussa</a>, <a href="Mathraki" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mathraki</a> and <a href="Othonoi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Othonoi</a>. The principal town of the island and seat of the municipality (pop. 33,886) is also named <a href="Corfu_(city)" title="wikilink">Corfu</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Corfu is home to the <a href="Ionian_University" title="wikilink">Ionian University</a>.</p>
<p>The island is connected to the <a href="history_of_Greece" title="wikilink">history of Greece</a> from the beginning of <a href="Greek_mythology" title="wikilink">Greek mythology</a>. Its Greek <a href="name" class="uri" title="wikilink">name</a>, <em>Kerkyra</em> or <em><a href="Korkyra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Korkyra</a></em>, is related to two powerful water symbols: <a href="Poseidon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poseidon</a>, god of the sea, and <a href="Asopus" title="wikilink">Asopos</a>, an important Greek mainland river.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> According to myth, Poseidon fell in love with the beautiful nymph <a href="Korkyra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Korkyra</a>, daughter of Asopus and river nymph <a href="Metope_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Metope</a>, and abducted her.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Poseidon brought Korkyra to the hitherto unnamed island and, in marital bliss, offered her name to the place: <em>Korkyra</em>,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> which gradually evolved to <em>Kerkyra</em> (<a href="Doric_Greek" title="wikilink">Doric</a>).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Together, they had a child they called <em>Phaiax</em>, after whom the inhabitants of the island were named: <em><a href="Scheria" title="wikilink">Phaiakes</a></em>. This term was transliterated via <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> to Phaeacians.</p>
<p>The island's history is laden with battles and conquests. The legacy of these struggles is visible in the form of castles punctuating strategic locations across the island. Two of these castles enclose its capital, which is the only city in Greece to be surrounded in such a way. As a result, Corfu's capital has been officially declared a <em>Kastropolis</em> (&quot;castle city&quot;) by the Greek government.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Corfu was long controlled by <a href="Venetian_Republic" title="wikilink">Venice</a>, which repulsed several <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Turkish</a> sieges, before falling under <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> rule following the <a href="Napoleonic_Wars" title="wikilink">Napoleonic Wars</a>. Corfu was eventually ceded by the British Empire along with the remaining islands of the <a href="United_States_of_the_Ionian_Islands" title="wikilink">United States of the Ionian Islands</a>, and unification with <a href="Kingdom_of_Greece" title="wikilink">modern Greece</a> was concluded in 1864 under the <a href="Treaty_of_London_(1864)" title="wikilink">Treaty of London</a>.</p>
<p>In 2007, the city's old town was designated for the <a href="UNESCO" class="uri" title="wikilink">UNESCO</a> <a href="World_Heritage_List" title="wikilink">World Heritage List</a>, following a recommendation by <a href="International_Council_on_Monuments_and_Sites" title="wikilink">ICOMOS</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Two high and well-defined ranges divide the island into three districts, of which the northern is mountainous, the central undulating, and the southern low-lying. The more important of the two ranges, that of Pantokrator (&lt;U+03A0&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03AC&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03C9&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt; - the ancient Istone) stretches east and west from Cape Falacro to Cape Psaromita, and attains its greatest elevation in the summit of the same name.</p>

<p>The second range culminates in the mountain of Santi Jeca, or Santa Decca, as it is called by misinterpretation of the Greek designation <em>&lt;U+0386&gt;&lt;U+03B3&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt; &lt;U+0394&gt;&lt;U+03AD&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;</em> (Hagioi Deka), or the Ten Saints. The whole island, composed as it is of various limestone formations, presents great diversity of surface, and views from more elevated spots are magnificent. Beaches are found in Agios Gordis, the <a href="Korission_lagoon" title="wikilink">Korission lagoon</a>, Agios Georgios, Marathia, Kassiopi, Sidari, Palaiokastritsa and many others. Corfu is located near the <a href="Kefalonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kefalonia</a> geological fault formation; earthquakes have occurred. Corfu town and countryside have not lost the traditional architecture from the 16th century.</p>
<p>Corfu's coastline spans  including capes; its highest point is <a href="Mount_Pantokrator" title="wikilink">Mount Pantokrator</a> (); and the second Stravoskiadi, at . The full extent of capes and promentories take in Agia Aikaterini, Drastis to the north, Lefkimmi and Asprokavos to the southeast, and Megachoro to the south. Two islands are also to be found at a middle point of Gouvia and Corfu Bay, which extends across much of the eastern shore of the island; are known as Lazareto and Ptychia (or Vido).

The old town, having grown within fortifications, where every metre of ground was precious, is a labyrinth of narrow streets paved with cobblestones, sometimes tortuous but colourful and clean. These streets are known as <em>kanto&lt;U+00FA&gt;nia</em> (), and the older amongst them sometimes follow the gentle irregularities of the ground; while many are too narrow for vehicular traffic.

Nonetheless, the interior has been restored and is in use for cultural events, such as concerts (&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03C5&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C5&gt;&lt;U+03BB&gt;&lt;U+03AF&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt;) and Sound and Light Productions (&lt;U+0397&gt;&lt;U+03C7&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt; &lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt; &lt;U+03A6&gt;&lt;U+03C9&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt;), when historical events are recreated using sound and light special effects.

The site of the ancient city of Corcyra (Kerkyra) is well ascertained, about  to the south-east of Corfu, upon the narrow piece of ground between the sea-lake of <a href="Halikiopoulo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Halikiopoulo</a> and the Bay of Castrades, in each of which it had a port. The circular tomb of <a href="Menekrates" class="uri" title="wikilink">Menekrates</a>, with its well-known inscription, is on the Bay of Castrades.

<p>German <a href="Wilhelm_II_of_Germany" title="wikilink">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> was also fond of taking holidays in Corfu. Having purchased the Achilleion in 1907 after Sissi's death, he appointed <a href="Carl_Ludwig_Sprenger" title="wikilink">Carl Ludwig Sprenger</a> as the botanical architect of the Palace, and also built a bridge to be named by the locals after him: &quot;Kaiser's bridge&quot; (Greek: &lt;U+03B7&gt; &lt;U+03B3&gt;&lt;U+03AD&gt;&lt;U+03C6&gt;&lt;U+03C5&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt; &lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C5&gt; &lt;U+039A&gt;&lt;U+03AC&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03B6&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt; transliterated as: i yefyra tou Kaizer), to access the beach without traversing the road forming the island's main artery to the south. The bridge, arching over the road, spanned the distance between the lower gardens of Achilleion and the nearby beach; its remains, a monument to imperial vanity as well as impracticality, are an important landmark on the highway. The bridge's central section was, ironically, demolished by the <a href="Wehrmacht" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wehrmacht</a> during the German occupation of World War II to allow for the free movement of its vehicles.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>The earliest reference to Corfu is the <a href="Mycenaean_Greece" title="wikilink">Mycenaean Greek</a> word <em>ko-ro-ku-ra-i-jo (</em>&quot;man from Kerkyra&quot;) written in <a href="Linear_B" title="wikilink">Linear B</a> syllabic script, ca. 1300 BC.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> According to <a href="Strabo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Strabo</a> Corcyra (&lt;U+039A&gt;&lt;U+03CC&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03C5&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;) was the <a href="Homer" title="wikilink">Homeric</a> island of <a href="Scheria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scheria</a> (&lt;U+03A3&gt;&lt;U+03C7&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03AF&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;),<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> and its earliest inhabitants were the <a href="Phaeacians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phaeacians</a> (&lt;U+03A6&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03AF&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt;). The island has indeed been identified by some scholars with Scheria, the island of the Phaeacians described in <a href="Homer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homer</a>'s Odyssey, though conclusive and irrefutable evidence for this theory or for <a href="Ithaca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ithaca</a>'s location have not been found. At a date no doubt previous to the foundation of <a href="Syracuse,_Italy" title="wikilink">Syracuse</a> it was peopled by settlers from <a href="Ancient_Corinth" title="wikilink">Corinth</a>, probably 730 BC, but it appears to have previously received a stream of emigrants from <a href="Eretria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eretria</a>. The commercially advantageous location of Corcyra on the way between Greece and <a href="Magna_Grecia" title="wikilink">Magna Grecia</a>, and its fertile lowlands in the southern section of the island favoured its growth and, influenced perhaps by the presence of non-Corinthian settlers, its people, quite contrary to the usual practice of Corinthian colonies, maintained an independent and even hostile attitude towards the mother city. This opposition came to a head in the early part of the 7th century BC, when their fleets fought the first naval battle recorded in Greek history: 665 BC. according to <a href="Thucydides" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thucydides</a>. These hostilities ended in the conquest of Corcyra by the Corinthian tyrant <a href="Periander" class="uri" title="wikilink">Periander</a> (&lt;U+03A0&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03AF&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt;) who induced his new subjects to join in the colonization of <a href="Apollonia,_Illyria" title="wikilink">Apollonia</a> and <a href="Anactorium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anactorium</a>. The island soon regained its independence and henceforth devoted itself to a purely mercantile policy. During the <a href="Iran" title="wikilink">Persian</a> invasion of 480 BC it manned the second largest Greek fleet (60 ships), but took no active part in the war. In 435 BC it was again involved in a quarrel with <a href="Ancient_Corinth" title="wikilink">Corinth</a> over the control of <a href="Epidamnus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Epidamnus</a>, and sought assistance from Athens (see <a href="Battle_of_Sybota" title="wikilink">Battle of Sybota</a>). <a href="File:Temple_at_Kardaki_in_Corfu.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|left|200px|The ruins of the Temple at Kardaki about 700 BC</a> This new alliance was one of the chief immediate causes of the <a href="Peloponnesian_War" title="wikilink">Peloponnesian War</a>, in which Corcyra was of considerable use to the <a href="Athens" title="wikilink">Athenians</a> as a naval station, but did not render much assistance with its fleet. The island was nearly lost to Athens by two attempts of the oligarchic faction to effect a revolution; on each occasion the popular party ultimately won the day and took a most bloody revenge on its opponents (427 BC and 425 BC). During the <a href="Sicily" title="wikilink">Sicilian</a> campaigns of Athens Corcyra served as a supply base; after a third abortive rising of the oligarchs in 410 BC it practically withdrew from the war. In 375 BC it again joined the Athenian alliance; two years later it was besieged by a <a href="Sparta" title="wikilink">Spartan</a> force, but in spite of the devastation of its flourishing countryside held out successfully until relieved. In the <a href="Hellenistic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hellenistic</a> period Corcyra was exposed to attack from several sides.</p>
<p>In 303 BC after a vain siege by <a href="Cassander" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cassander</a>, the island was occupied for a short time by the <a href="Lacedaemonian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lacedaemonian</a> general <a href="Cleonymus_of_Sparta" title="wikilink">Cleonymus of Sparta</a>, then regained its independence and later it was attacked and conquered by <a href="Agathocles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Agathocles</a>.

The island then became a member of the Epirotic alliance. It was then perhaps that the settlement of <a href="Cassiope(city)" title="wikilink">Cassiope</a> was founded to serve as a base for the King of Epirus' expeditions. The island remained in the Epirotic alliance until 255 BC when it became independent after the death of <a href="Alexander_II_of_Epirus" title="wikilink">Alexander</a>, last King of Epirus. In 229, it was captured by the <a href="Illyrians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Illyrians</a>, but was speedily delivered by a <a href="Roman_Republic" title="wikilink">Roman</a> fleet and remained a Roman naval station until at least 189. At this time, it was governed by a prefect (presumably nominated by the consuls), but in 148 it was attached to the province of <a href="Macedonia_(Roman_province)" title="wikilink">Macedonia</a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In 31 BC, it served <a href="Augustus_Caesar" title="wikilink">Octavian</a> (Augustus) as a base against <a href="Mark_Antony" title="wikilink">Mark Antony</a>. From AD 336 onwards, it was ruled by the Eastern Roman Empire. After the definitive division of the Roman Empire in 395, Kerkyra remained with the Eastern Roman Empire, known in modern historiography as the Byzantine Empire.</p>

<p>Eclipsed by the foundation of <a href="Nicopolis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nicopolis</a>, Kerkyra for a long time passed out of notice. With the rise of the <a href="Normans" title="wikilink">Norman</a> kingdom in Sicily and the <a href="Italy" title="wikilink">Italian</a> naval powers, it again became a frequent object of attack. In 1081-1085 it was held by <a href="Robert_Guiscard" title="wikilink">Robert Guiscard</a>, in 1147-1154 by <a href="Roger_II_of_Sicily" title="wikilink">Roger II of Sicily</a>. During the break-up of the Later <a href="Byzantine_Empire" title="wikilink">Byzantine Empire</a> it was occupied by <a href="Genoa" title="wikilink">Genoese</a> privateers (1197&lt;U+2013&gt;1207) who in turn were expelled by the Venetians. In 1214-1259 it passed to the Greek <a href="despotate_of_Epirus" title="wikilink">despots of Epirus</a>, and in 1267 became a possession of the Neapolitan house of <a href="Anjou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anjou</a>. Under the latter's weak rule the island suffered considerably from the inroads of various adventurers; hence in 1386 it placed itself under the protection of <a href="Republic_of_Venice" title="wikilink">Venice</a>, which in 1401 acquired formal sovereignty over Corfu and kept it until the French Occupation in 1797.</p>

<p>Kerkyra, the &quot;Door of Venice&quot; during the centuries when the whole Adriatic was the <a href="Gulf_of_Venice" title="wikilink">Gulf of Venice</a>,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> remained in Venetian hands from 1401 until 1797, though several times assailed by Turkish naval and land forces and subjected to four notable sieges in 1537, 1571, 1573 and 1716, in which the great natural strength of the city and its defenders asserted itself time after time. The effectiveness of the powerful Venetian fortifications of the island as well as the strength of some old Byzantine fortifications in <a href="Angelokastro_(Corfu)" title="wikilink">Angelokastro</a>, Kassiopi, Gardiki and others, was another strong factor that enabled Corfu to remain the last bastion of free, uninterrupted Greek Christian civilization in the southern Balkans after the fall of <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a>. <a href="Will_Durant" title="wikilink">Will Durant</a> claims that Corfu owed to the <a href="Republic_of_Venice" title="wikilink">Republic of Venice</a> the fact that it was the only part of Greece never conquered by the muslim Turks.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>A series of attempts by the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman</a> Turks to take the island began in 1431 when Turkish troops under Ali Bey landed on the island, tried to take the castle and raided the surrounding area, but were repulsed.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Siege_of_Corfu_(1537)" title="wikilink">Siege of Corfu (1537)</a> was the first great siege by the Ottomans. It began on the 29th August, 1537, with 25,000 soldiers from the Turkish fleet landing and pillaging the island and taking 20,000 hostages as slaves. Despite the destruction wrought on the countryside, the city castle held out in spite of repeated attempts over twelve days to take it, and the Turks left the island unsuccessfully because of poor logistics and an epidemic that decimated their ranks.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>Thirty-four years later, in August, 1571, Turkish forces returned for yet another attempt to conquer the island. Having seized Parga and Mourtos from the Greek mainland side they attacked the Paxi islands. Subsequently they landed on Corfu's southeast shore and established a large beachhead all the way from the southern tip of the island at Lefkimi to Ipsos in Corfu's eastern midsection. These areas were thoroughly pillaged as in past encounters. Nevertheless the city castle stood firm again, a testament to Corfiot-Venetian steadfastness as well as the Venetian castle-building <a href="engineering" class="uri" title="wikilink">engineering</a> skills. It is also worth mentioning that another castle, <a href="Angelokastro_(Corfu)" title="wikilink">Angelokastro</a> (Greek: &lt;U+0391&gt;&lt;U+03B3&gt;&lt;U+03B3&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03BB&gt;&lt;U+03CC&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt; meaning <em>Angelo's Castle</em> and named for its Byzantine owner Angelos Komnenos), situated on the northwest coast near Palaiokastritsa (Greek: &lt;U+03A0&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03BB&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03AF&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt; meaning <em>Old Castle place</em>) and located on particularly steep and rocky terrain, a tourist attraction today, also held out.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>These Turkish defeats in the east and the west of the island proved decisive and the Turks abandoned their siege and departed. Two years later Turkish forces repeated their attempt. Coming from <a href="Africa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Africa</a> after a victorious campaign, they landed in Corfu and wreaked havoc on rural areas a further time. This force's troops were not particularly noted for their discipline, however, so following a counterattack by the Venetian-Corfiot forces they were forced to leave the city by way of the sea.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>The second great siege of Corfu took place in 1716, during the last <a href="Turkish-Venetian_War_(1714-1718)" title="wikilink">Turkish Venetian War</a>. After the conquest of the Peloponnese in 1715, the Ottoman fleet appeared in <a href="Buthrotum" title="wikilink">Butrinto</a> opposite Corfu. On 8 July the Turkish fleet, carrying 33,000 men, sailed to Corfu from Butrinto and established a beachhead at Ipsos.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The same day, the Venetian fleet encountered the Turkish fleet off the channel of Corfu and defeated it in the ensuing naval battle. On 19 July, after taking a few outlying forts, the Ottoman army reached the hills around the city of Corfu and laid siege to it. Despite repeated assaults and heavy fighting, the Turks were unable to breach the defences and were forced to raise the siege after 22 days. The 5,000 Venetians and foreign mercenaries, together with 3,000 Corfiotes, under the leadership of Count <a href="Johann_Matthias_von_der_Schulenburg" title="wikilink">von der Schulenburg</a> who commanded the defence of the island, were victorious once more.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The success is owed in no small part to the extensive fortifications, where Venetian castle engineering had proven itself once again against considerable odds. The repulse of the Ottomans was widely celebrated in Europe, Corfu being seen as a bastion of <a href="western_culture" title="wikilink">Western civilization</a> against the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman</a> tide. Today, however, this role is often relatively unknown or ignored, but was celebrated in <em><a href="Juditha_triumphans" title="wikilink">Juditha triumphans</a></em> by the Venetian composer <a href="Antonio_Vivaldi" title="wikilink">Antonio Vivaldi</a>.</p>

<p>Corfu Town looks very different from most Greek towns, because of Corfu's unique history. From 1386 to 1797, Corfu was ruled by Venetian nobility; much of the town reflects this era when the island belonged to the <a href="Republic_of_Venice" title="wikilink">Republic of Venice</a>, with multi-storied buildings on narrow lanes.</p>
<p>Many Venetian-speaking families settled in Corfu during these centuries and until the second half of the 20th century, the <em><a href="Venetian_language" title="wikilink">Veneto da mar</a></em> was spoken in Corfu: they were called <a href="Corfiot_Italians" title="wikilink">Corfiot Italians</a>. During this time, the local Greek language assimilated a large number of Italian and Venetian words, many of which are still common today.</p>
<p>The Venetian feudal families pursued a mild but somewhat enervating policy towards the natives, who began to adopt some segments of Venetian customs and culture. The Corfiotes were encouraged to enrich themselves by the cultivation of the olive, but were debarred from entering into commercial competition with Venice.</p>
<p>The island served as a refuge for Greek scholars, and in 1732 became the home of the first academy of modern Greece. A Corfu clergyman and scholar, <a href="Nikephoros_Theotokis" title="wikilink">Nikephoros Theotokis</a> (1732&lt;U+2013&gt;1800) became renowned in Greece as an educator, and in <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a> (where he moved later in his life) as an Orthodox archbishop.</p>
<p>Many Italian Jews took refuge in Corfu during the Venetian centuries and spoke their own language (<a href="Italkian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italkian</a>), a mixture of Hebrew-Italian in a Venetian or Apulian dialect with some Greek words.</p>
<p>The Venetian influence was important in the development of opera on Corfu. During Venetian rule, the Corfiotes developed a fervent appreciation of Italian opera, which was the real source of the extraordinary (given the conditions in the mainland of Greece) musical development of the island during that era. It was in Venetian times that the town saw the erection of the first opera in Greece, but it was badly damaged during World War II by German artilery.</p>
<p>The internationally renowned Venetian-born British photographer <a href="Felice_Beato" title="wikilink">Felice Beato</a> is thought to have spent much of his childhood in Corfu.</p>
<p>Venetians promoted the <a href="Catholic_church" title="wikilink">Catholic church</a> during their four centuries rule in Corfu. Even if today the majority of Corfiots are <a href="Greek_Orthodox" title="wikilink">Greek Orthodox</a> (following the official religion of Greece), a percentage of Catholics (5%) nevertheless owe their faith to these origins. These contemporary Catholics are mostly families who came from <a href="Malta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malta</a>, but also from Italy during the <a href="Republic_of_Venice" title="wikilink">Republic of Venice</a>, and today the Catholic community takes in about 4000 people, (2/3 of Maltese descent) who live almost exclusively in the Venetian &quot;Citadel&quot; of <a href="Corfu_City" title="wikilink">Corfu City</a>, and harmoniously side-by-side with the Orthodox community. Like other native Greek Catholics, they celebrate <a href="Easter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Easter</a> using the same calendar as the <a href="Greek_Orthodox" title="wikilink">Greek Orthodox</a> church.</p>
<p>The island's way of life absorbed Venetian influence in a variety of ways ; its local cuisine, for example, took in such elements and today's Corfiot cooking maintains some of these Venetian delicacies and recipes: &quot;Pastitsada&quot;, deriving from the Venetian &quot;Pastissada&quot; (Italian: &quot;Spezzatino&quot;) and is the most popular dish in the island of Corfu, &quot;Sofrito&quot;, &quot;Strapatsada&quot;, &quot;Savoro&quot;, &quot;Bianco&quot; and &quot;Mandolato&quot;.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

For a short time it became the capital of a self-governing federation of the <a href="Septinsular_Republic" title="wikilink">Heptanesos</a> (&quot;Seven Islands&quot;), under Ottoman suzerainty; in 1807 after the <a href="Treaty_of_Tilsit" title="wikilink">Treaty of Tilsit</a> its faction-ridden government was again replaced by a French administration under governor <a href="Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois-Xavier_Donzelot" title="wikilink">Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois-Xavier Donzelot</a>, and in 1809 it was besieged in vain by a British fleet, which had taken all the other Ionian islands. When, by the <a href="Treaty_of_Paris_(1815)" title="wikilink">Treaty of Paris</a> of 5 November 1815, the Ionian Islands became a protectorate of the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> as the <a href="United_States_of_the_Ionian_Islands" title="wikilink">United States of the Ionian Islands</a>, Corfu became the seat of the British <a href="Lord_High_Commissioner_of_the_Ionian_Islands" title="wikilink">Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands</a>. The British commissioners, who were practically autocrats in spite of the retention of the native senate and assembly, introduced a strict method of government which brought about a decided improvement in the material prosperity of the island, but by its very strictness displeased the natives. On 29 March 1864, the United Kingdom, Greece, France and Russia signed the Treaty of London, pledging the transfer of sovereignty to Greece upon ratification. Thus, on 28 May, by proclamation of the Lord High Commissioner, the Ionian Islands were united with Greece.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>During the <a href="Greco-Italian_War" title="wikilink">Greco-Italian War</a>, Corfu was occupied by the Italians in April 1941.

<p>After World War II and the <a href="Greek_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Greek Civil War</a>, the island was rebuilt under the general programme of reconstruction of the Greek Government (&lt;U+0391&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03CC&gt;&lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt;) and many elements of its classical architecture remain. Its economy grew but a portion of its inhabitants left the island for other parts of the country; buildings erected during Italian occupation &lt;U+2013&gt; such as schools or government buildings &lt;U+2013&gt; were put back to civic use.

<p>Corfiote musical tradition is significant. In the past, people would join in the singing of <em>cant&lt;U+00E1&gt;des</em> (), impromptu choral songs in two, three or four voices, usually accompanied by a guitar. Nowadays, in the face of rigours of a modern life from which Corfiote society has not been spared, <em>cant&lt;U+00E1&gt;des</em> (from the Italian verb <em>cantare</em>, <em>to sing</em>) are only performed by semi-professional or amateur singers, often as attractions for visitors.</p>
<p>'Bands' (Philharmonic societies, or <em>&lt;U+03A6&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BB&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03AD&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt;</em>), which also provide free instruction in music, are still popular and continue to attract young recruits. There are nineteen such marching wind bands throughout the island.<br />
Corfu Town is home to the three most prestigious bands - in order of seniority:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="Philharmonic_Society_of_Corfu" title="wikilink">Philharmonic Society of Corfu</a> use dark blue uniforms with dark red accents, and blue and red helmet plumes. It is usually called the <em>Old Philharmonic</em> or simply the <em>Pali&lt;U+00E1&gt;</em> (&quot;Old&quot;). Founded September 12, <a href="1840" class="uri" title="wikilink">1840</a>.</li>
<li>the <a href="Nikolaos_Mantzaros" title="wikilink">Mantzaros</a> Philharmonic Society use blue uniforms with blue and white helmet plumes. It is commonly called the <em>N&lt;U+00E9&gt;a</em> (&quot;New&quot;). Founded October 25, <a href="1890" class="uri" title="wikilink">1890</a>.</li>
<li>the <a href="John_Capodistria" title="wikilink">Capodistria</a> Philharmonic Union use bright red and black uniforms and plumes. It is commonly called the <em>C&lt;U+00F3&gt;nte Capod&lt;U+00ED&gt;stria</em> or simply the <em>C&lt;U+00F3&gt;nte</em> (&quot;<a href="Count" class="uri" title="wikilink">Count</a>&quot;). It is the juniormost of the three (founded April 18, <a href="1980" class="uri" title="wikilink">1980</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>All three maintain two major bands each, the main marching bands that can field up to 200 musicians on grand occasions, and the 60-strong student <em>bandinas</em> meant for lighter fare and on-the-job training.</p>
<p>The bands give regular summer weekend promenade concerts at the Spianada Green <a href="gazebo" title="wikilink">&quot;<em>p&lt;U+00E1&gt;lko</em>&quot;</a>, and have a prominent part in the yearly Holy Week ceremonies. A considerable but mostly friendly rivalry between them persists, and each rigorously adhere to their respective repertoires. Every time one of these bands passes in front of the building housing another, they stop and give a musical &quot;salute&quot; to their rival. While this is officially a sign of respect, it is actually a challenge meant to show off to the rivals and impress them with a display of superior musicianship.</p>

Late in the afternoon, the squads come together to form one band in order to accompany the <a href="Epitaphios_(liturgical)" title="wikilink">Epitaph procession</a> of the cathedral, while the funeral marches that the bands play differ depending on the band ; the Old Philharmonic play <a href="Albinoni" class="uri" title="wikilink">Albinoni</a>'s <em>Adagio</em>, the Mantzaros play <a href="Giuseppe_Verdi" title="wikilink">Verdi</a>'s <em>Marcia Funebre</em> from <a href="Don_Carlo" title="wikilink">Don Carlo</a>, and the Capodistria play <a href="Fr&lt;U+00E9&gt;d&lt;U+00E9&gt;ric_Chopin" title="wikilink">Chopin</a>'s <em>Funeral March</em> and <a href="Angelo_Mariani_(conductor)" title="wikilink">Mariani</a>'s <em>Sventura</em>.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>On Holy Saturday morning, the three town bands again take part in the <a href="Epitaphios_(liturgical)" title="wikilink">Epitaph processions</a> of St. Spyridon Cathedral in procession with the Saint's relics.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> At this point the bands play different funeral marches, with the Mantzaros playing <a href="Miccheli" class="uri" title="wikilink">Miccheli</a>'s <em>Calde Lacrime</em>, the Palia playing <em>Marcia Funebre</em> from <a href="Franco_Faccio" title="wikilink">Faccio</a>'s <em><a href="Amleto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amleto</a></em>, and the Capodistria playing the <em>Funeral March</em> from <a href="Ludwig_van_Beethoven" title="wikilink">Beethoven</a>'s <em><a href="Symphony_No._3_(Beethoven)" title="wikilink">Eroica</a></em>. This custom dates from the 19th century, when colonial administrators banned the participation of the British garrison band in the traditional Holy Friday funeral cortege. The defiant Corfiotes held the litany the following morning, and paraded the relics of St. Spyridon too, so that the administrators would not dare intervene.</p>
<p>The litany is followed by the celebration of the &quot;Early Resurrection&quot;; balconies in the old town are decked in bright red cloth, and Corfiotes throw down large clay pots (the <em>b&lt;U+00F3&gt;tides</em>, &lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03C0&gt;&lt;U+03CC&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt;) full of water to smash on the street pavement, especially in wider areas of Liston|Liston}} and in an organised fashion.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> This is enacted in anticipation of the Resurrection of Jesus, which is to be celebrated that same night,<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> and to commemorate <a href="King_David" title="wikilink">King David</a>'s phrase: &quot;<em>Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel</em>&quot; (<a href="Psalm_2" title="wikilink">Psalm 2</a>:9).</p>
<p>Once the <em>b&lt;U+00F3&gt;tides</em> commotion is over, the three bands parade the clay-strewn streets playing the famous &quot;<em>Graiko&lt;U+00ED&gt;</em>&quot; festive march.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> This legendary march, the anthem of the island, was composed during Venetian rule, and its lyrics urged: &quot;<em>Greeks, never fear, we are all enslaved: you to the Turks, we to the Venetians, but one day we shall all be free</em>&quot;. The Venetians were replaced by the French and the French by the British, and both the lyrics and the performance of the march were officially banned. The bands, however, defiantly played it on the Eve of Easter, as a token of the resurrection of the nation, and the tradition is honored to this day.</p>
<h4 id="musical-history">Musical history</h4>
<p>While much of present-day Greece was under Ottoman rule, the Ionian Islands enjoyed a Golden Age in music and opera. Corfu was the capital city of a prized Venetian colony and it benefited from a unique musical and theatrical heritage. Then in the 19th century, as a <a href="Protectorate" title="wikilink">British Protectorate</a>, Corfu developed a musical heritage of its own and which constitutes the nucleus of modern Greek musical history. Until the early 18th century, musical life took place in town and village squares, with performances of straight or musical comedies &lt;U+2013&gt; known as Momaries or Bobaries. From <a href="1720" class="uri" title="wikilink">1720</a>, Corfu became the possessor of the first theatre in post-<a href="1452" class="uri" title="wikilink">1452</a> Greece. It was the Teatro San Giacomo (now the Town Hall) named after the nearby Roman Catholic cathedral (completed in <a href="1691" class="uri" title="wikilink">1691</a>).<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>

<p>In <a href="Republic_of_Venice" title="wikilink">Venetian rule</a>, the Corfiotes developed a fervent appreciation of Italian <a href="opera" class="uri" title="wikilink">opera</a>, which was the real source of the extraordinary (given conditions in the mainland of <a href="Greece" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greece</a>) musical development of the island during this era.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> The opera house of Corfu during 18th and 19th century was that of the <a href="Nobile_Teatro_di_San_Giacomo_di_Corf&lt;U+00F9&gt;" title="wikilink">Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo</a>, named after the neighbouring catholic cathedral, but the theatre was later converted into the Town Hall.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> It was both the first <a href="theatre" class="uri" title="wikilink">theatre</a> and first <a href="opera_house" title="wikilink">opera house</a> of Greece in <a href="modern_history" title="wikilink">modern times</a> and the place where the first Greek opera, <a href="Spyridon_Xyndas" title="wikilink">Spyridon Xyndas</a>' &quot;The Parliamentary Candidate&quot; based on an exclusively Greek <a href="libretto" class="uri" title="wikilink">libretto</a> was performed.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> A long series of local composers, such as <a href="Nikolaos_Mantzaros" title="wikilink">Nikolaos Mantzaros</a>, <a href="Spyridon_Xyndas" title="wikilink">Spyridon Xyndas</a>, <a href="Antonio_Liberali" title="wikilink">Antonio Liberali</a>, <a href="Domenico_Padovani" title="wikilink">Domenico Padovani</a>, the <a href="Zante" title="wikilink">Zakynthian</a> <a href="Pavlos_Carrer" title="wikilink">Pavlos Carrer</a>, the <a href="Lambelet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lambelet</a> family, <a href="Spyridon_Samaras" title="wikilink">Spyridon Samaras</a>, and others, all developed careers intertwined with the theatre.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> San Giacomo's place was taken by the Municipal Theatre in 1902, which maintained the operatic tradition vividly until its destruction during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> as a result of a 1943 <a href="Axis_occupation_of_Greece_during_World_War_II" title="wikilink">German air raid</a>.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
