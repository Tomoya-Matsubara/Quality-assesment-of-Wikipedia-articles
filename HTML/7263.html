<p>A <strong>toilet</strong> is a <a href="sanitation" class="uri" title="wikilink">sanitation</a> fixture used primarily for the disposal of human urine and feces. They are often found in a small room referred to as a <a href="toilet_(room)" title="wikilink">toilet/bathroom/lavatory</a>. <a href="Flush_toilet" title="wikilink">Flush toilets</a>, which are common in many parts of the world, may be connected to a nearby <a href="septic_tank" title="wikilink">septic tank</a> or more commonly in urban areas via &quot;large&quot; () sewer pipe connected to a <a href="sewerage" class="uri" title="wikilink">sewerage</a> pipe system. The water and waste from many different sources is piped in large pipes to a more distant <a href="sewage_treatment" title="wikilink">sewage treatment plant</a>. <a href="Chemical_toilet" title="wikilink">Chemical toilets</a> are used in mobile and many temporary situations where there is no access to sewerage, dry toilets, including <a href="pit_toilet" title="wikilink">pit toilets</a> and <a href="composting_toilet" title="wikilink">composting toilet</a> require no or little water with excreta being removed manually or <a href="composted" class="uri" title="wikilink">composted</a> in situ.</p>

<p>According to Teresi et al. (2002):<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The third millennium BC was the &quot;Age of Cleanliness.&quot; Toilets and sewers were invented in several parts of the world, and <a href="Mohenjo-Daro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mohenjo-Daro</a> circa 2800 BC had some of the most advanced, with lavatories built into the outer walls of houses. These were primitive &quot;Western-style&quot; toilets made from bricks with wooden seats on top. They had vertical chutes, through which waste fell into street drains or cesspits. <a href="Mortimer_Wheeler" title="wikilink">Sir Mortimer Wheeler</a>, the director general of archaeology in India from 1944 to 1948, wrote, &quot;The high quality of the sanitary arrangements could well be envied in many parts of the world today.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The toilets at <a href="Mohenjo-Daro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mohenjo-Daro</a>, built about 2600 BC and described above, were only used by the affluent classes. Most people would have squatted over old pots set into the ground or used open pits.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The people of the <a href="Indus_Valley_Civilization" title="wikilink">Harappan civilization</a> in Pakistan and north-western India had primitive water-cleaning toilets that used flowing water in each house that were linked with drains covered with burnt clay bricks. The flowing water removed the human wastes.</p>
<p>Early toilets that used flowing water to remove the waste are also found at <a href="Skara_Brae" title="wikilink">Skara Brae</a> in <a href="Orkney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orkney</a>, Scotland, which was occupied from about 3100 BC until 2500 BC. Some of the houses there have a drain running directly beneath them, and some of these had a cubicle over the drain. Around the 18th century BC, toilets started to appear in <a href="Minoan_Crete" title="wikilink">Minoan Crete</a>; <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a> in the time of the <a href="Pharaohs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pharaohs</a> and ancient <a href="Persia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Persia</a>. In <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Roman</a> civilization, toilets using flowing water were sometimes part of public <a href="Public_bathing" title="wikilink">bath houses</a>.</p>
<p>In 2012, archaeologists founded what is believed to be Southeast Asia's earliest latrine during the excavation of a neolithic village in the <a href=":vi:Di_t&lt;U+00ED&gt;ch_kh&lt;U+1EA3&gt;o_c&lt;U+1ED5&gt;_h&lt;U+1ECD&gt;c_R&lt;U+1EA1&gt;ch_N&lt;U+00FA&gt;i" title="wikilink">R&lt;U+1EA1&gt;ch N&lt;U+00FA&gt;i archaeological site</a>, Southern <a href="Viet_Nam" title="wikilink">Viet Nam</a>. The toilet, dating back 1500 BC, yielded important clues about early Southeast Asian society. More than 30 preserved feces from humans and dogs containing fish and shattered animal bones from the site provided a wealth of information on both the diet of humans and dogs at R&lt;U+1EA1&gt;ch N&lt;U+00FA&gt;i, but also on the types of parasites each had to contend with.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Roman toilets, like the ones pictured here, are commonly thought to have been used in the sitting position. But sitting toilets only came into general use in the mid-19th century in the Western world.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The Roman toilets were probably elevated to raise them above open sewers which were periodically &quot;flushed&quot; with flowing water, rather than elevated for sitting. The Romans weren't the first civilisation to adopt a sewer system - The Indus Valley civilisation had a rudimentary network of sewers built under grid pattern streets and it was the most advanced seen so far.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> <a href="Squat_toilet" title="wikilink">Squat toilets</a> (also known as an Arabic, French, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Iranian, Indian, Turkish or Natural-Position toilet) are toilets used by squatting rather than sitting, and are still used by the majority of the world's population.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> There are several types of squat toilets, but they all consist essentially of a hole in the ground or floor with various provisions for human waste.</p>
<h3 id="early-modern-europe">Early modern Europe</h3>
<p><img src="Bourdaloue_dsc02723.jpg" title="fig:Bourdaloue chamber pots from the Austrian Imperial household" alt="Bourdaloue chamber pots from the Austrian Imperial household" /> <a href="Chamber_pot" title="wikilink">Chamber pots</a> were in common use in Europe from ancient times, even being taken to the Middle East by Christian pilgrims during the Middle Ages.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> By the Early Modern era, chamber pots were frequently made of china or copper and could include elaborate decoration. They were emptied into the gutter of the street nearest to the home. During the <a href="Victorian_era" title="wikilink">Victorian era</a>, British housemaids emptied household chamber pots into a &quot;slop sink&quot; that was inside a housemaid's cupboard on the upper floor of the house. The housemaids' cupboard also contained a separate sink, made of wood with a lead lining to prevent chipping china chamber pots, for washing the &quot;bedroom ware&quot;. Once indoor running water was built into British houses, servants were sometimes given their own lavatory downstairs, separate from the family lavatory.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>By the 16th century, <a href="cesspit" title="wikilink">cesspits</a> and cesspools were increasingly dug into the ground near houses in Europe as a means of collecting waste, as urban populations grew and street gutters became blocked with the larger volume of human waste. Rain was no longer sufficient to wash away waste from the gutters. A pipe connected the latrine to the cesspool, and sometimes a small amount of water washed waste through the pipe into the cesspool. Cesspools would be cleaned out by tradesmen, who pumped out liquid waste, then shovelled out the solid waste and collected it in horse-drawn carts during the night. This solid waste would be used as fertilizer. The perception that human waste had value as fertilizer, and in ammonia production, delayed the construction of a modern sewer system in Paris as a replacement for the city's cesspool system. In the early 19th century, public officials and public hygiene experts studied and debated the matter at length, for several decades. The construction of an underground network of pipes to carry away solid and liquid waste was only begun in the 1880s, gradually replacing the cesspool system, although cesspools were still in use in some parts of Paris into the 20th century.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The growth of indoor plumbing, toilets and bathtubs with running water came at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="america">America</h3>
<p><img src="Co-ed.jpg" title="fig:Outhouse near Hidden Lake and Round Valley hike, Palm Springs" alt="Outhouse near Hidden Lake and Round Valley hike, Palm Springs" /> American lavatories followed the pattern of constructing cesspools in urban areas, using the practise already established in Europe, although the use of the <a href="outhouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">outhouse</a> near the family home was also common where more land was available, and keeping the waste well away from the well water was not a challenge. A textbook of architecture from 1903 indicates that cesspool construction was ideally done with 20-inch thick quarried stone, with cement mortar, and 6 feet deep.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The chain-pull indoor toilet, invented in England in the 1880s, was soon introduced to America, in the homes of the wealthy and in hotels. Flush toilets were introduced in the 1890s. Public awareness of germ theories about disease, as well as inexpensive manufacturing methods, helped the flushing toilet to spread to middle class and even working class households. Important American inventors who contributed to the development of the toilet during the early 1900s included <a href="William_Elvis_Sloan" title="wikilink">William Elvis Sloan</a> (1867-1961), of <a href="Chicago,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Chicago, Illinois</a>, and <a href="Philip_Haas" title="wikilink">Philip Haas</a> (1875-1927), of <a href="Dayton,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Dayton, Ohio</a>. Sloan introduced the 'Flushometer' and was responsible for several flush valve designs. Haas obtained numerous patents for flush valves, flushing systems, and water closet designs. Indoor plumbing, including flushing toilets, was common in American households by the 1920s. Edward and Clarence Scott began selling white perforated toilet tissue during this era, bringing additional convenience to the American public, who had until then relied on rough paper for toilet use.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="operation">Operation</h3>

<p><img src="Toilet_370x580.jpg" title="fig:Flush toilet bowl" alt="Flush toilet bowl" /> <embed src="Toilettensp&lt;U+00FC&gt;lung_01.ogg" title="fig:Sound of flush toilet in operation" /> A typical flush toilet is a <a href="vitreous_enamel" title="wikilink">vitreous</a>, <a href="ceramic" class="uri" title="wikilink">ceramic</a> bowl containing water plus special <a href="plumbing" class="uri" title="wikilink">plumbing</a> made to be rapidly filled with more water. The water in the toilet bowl is connected to a hollow drain pipe shaped like an upside down U connecting the drain. One side of the U channel is arranged as a hollow <a href="siphon" class="uri" title="wikilink">siphon</a> tube longer than the water in the bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The bottom of the upside down U-shaped drain pipe limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. If water is poured slowly into the toilet bowl it simply flows over the bottom of the upside down U and pours slowly down the drain&lt;U+2014&gt;the toilet does not flush. The water in the bowl both acts as a barrier to sewer gas entering and as a receptacle for waste. Sewer gas is vented through a vent pipe attached to the sewer line.</p>
<p>When a user flushes a toilet, a valve opens, and allows the toilet tank's water to quickly enter the toilet bowl. This rapid influx of water into the toilet bowl from the tank causes the swirling water in the bowl to rapidly rise and fill the upside down U-shaped drain and the siphon tube mounted in the back of the toilet. This full siphon tube starts the toilet's <a href="siphon" class="uri" title="wikilink">siphon</a> action. The siphon action rapidly (4&lt;U+2013&gt;7 seconds) &lt;U+201C&gt;pulls&lt;U+201D&gt; nearly all of the water and waste in the bowl and the on-rushing tank water down the drain&lt;U+2014&gt;it <strong>flushes</strong>. When most of the water has drained out of the bowl, the continuous column of water up and over the bottom of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe (the siphon) is broken when air enters the siphon tube. The toilet then gives its characteristic gurgle as the siphon action ceases and no more water flows out of the toilet. After flushing, the flapper valve in the water tank closes, and various water lines and valves connected to the household water supply refill the toilet tank and bowl. The toilet is again ready for use.</p>
<p>At the top of the toilet bowl is a rim built into the toilet with many slanted drain holes connected to the toilet tank to fill, rinse and induce swirling in the toilet bowl when it is flushed. Mounted above the toilet is a large holding tank with about (now)  of water. This tank is built with a large drain  diameter hole at its bottom covered by a flapper valve that allows the water to rapidly leave the holding tank. The toilet's <a href="plumbing" class="uri" title="wikilink">plumbing</a> is built to allow entry of the toilet tank&lt;U+2019&gt;s water into the toilet in a very short period of time. This water pours through the holes in the rim and a siphon jet hole about  diameter in the bottom of the toilet. Other toilets use a large hole in the front of the rim to allow rapid filling of the toilet bowl.</p>
<h3 id="manufacture">Manufacture</h3>
<p><img src="Old_toilet_with_elevated_cistern_and_chain.jpg" title="fig:Toilet with an elevated cistern of water and a chain attached to the tank to release water and flush the waste away" alt="Toilet with an elevated cistern of water and a chain attached to the tank to release water and flush the waste away" /> A two-piece attaching seat and toilet bowl lid are typically mounted over the toilet bowl, to allow covering the toilet when it is not in use, and to provide seating comfort while using the toilet. A toilet's body is made from vitreous china, which starts out as a thin clay mixture called a <a href="Slip_(ceramics)" title="wikilink">slip</a>. It takes about  of slip per toilet.</p>
<p>This slip is poured into the space between <a href="plaster_of_Paris" title="wikilink">plaster of Paris</a> molds. Toilet bowl, toilet rim, toilet tank and toilet tank lid all require separate molds. The molds are assembled and set up for filling and the slip-filled molds sit for about an hour after filling while the plaster of Paris molds absorb moisture from the slip making it semisolid next to the mold but staying liquid further from the surface of the molds. Then, the workers remove plugs that allow any excess liquid slip from the centers of the mold to pour from the mold&lt;U+2014&gt;this excess slip is recycled for later use. This drained-out slip leaves voids inside the fixture using less material, keeping it both lighter and easier to fire in a <a href="kiln" class="uri" title="wikilink">kiln</a>, and it allows the formation of intricate waste lines in the fixture&lt;U+2014&gt;the drain's centers are poured out as slip.</p>
<p>At this point, the toilet parts without their molds look like and are about as strong as soft clay. After about one hour the top core mold (interior of toilet) is removed. The rim mold bottom, which includes a place to mount the holding tank is removed, and it has the appropriate slanted holes for the rinsing jets cut and the mounting holes for tank and seat are punched into the rim piece. Large flapper valve holes for rapid water entry into the toilet are cut into the rim pieces. The exposed top of the bowl piece is then covered with a thick slip and the still uncured rim piece is attached on top of the bowl piece. The bowl and hollow rim are now a single piece. The bowl plus rim is then inverted and the toilet bowl is set upside down on the top rim mold to hold the pieces together as they dry. Later all the rest of the mold pieces are removed. As the clay dries further it hardens more and continues to shrink. After a few hours the casting is self-supporting, and is called <a href="pottery" title="wikilink">greenware</a>.</p>
<p>After the molds are removed' workers use hand tools and sponges to smooth the edges and surface of the greenware and remove the mold joints or roughness: this is called <em>fettling</em>. For large scale production pieces these steps may be automated. The parts are then left outside or put in a warm dry room to dry before going through a dryer at about 93&lt;U+00B0&gt;C (200&lt;U+00B0&gt;F), for about 20&lt;U+2013&gt;36 hours.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>After finishing the surfaces, the bowls and tanks are sprayed with <a href="ceramic_glaze" title="wikilink">glaze</a> of various kinds to get different colors. This glaze is designed to shrink and contract at the same rate as the greenware while undergoing firing. After being sprayed with glaze the toilet bowls, tanks, and lids are placed in stacks on a conveyor belt or &quot;car&quot; that slowly goes through a large kiln to be <a href="Pottery" title="wikilink">fired</a>. The belt slowly moves the glaze covered greenware into a tunnel kiln, which has different temperature zones inside it starting at about 200&lt;U+00B0&gt;C (400&lt;U+00B0&gt;F) at the front, increasing towards the middle to over 1,200&lt;U+00B0&gt;C (2,200&lt;U+00B0&gt;F) degrees and exiting around out 90&lt;U+00B0&gt;C (200&lt;U+00B0&gt;F). During the firing in the kiln, the greenware and glaze are vitrified as one solid finished unit. Transiting the kiln takes glaze covered greenware around 23&lt;U+2013&gt;40 hours.</p>
<p>When the pieces are removed from the kiln and fully cooled, they are ready for inspection for cracks. After inspection, the flushing mechanism may be installed on a one piece toilet. On a two piece toilet with a separate tank the flushing mechanism may only be put on the tank with final assembly waiting installation. The seat too may be installed at this time, or the parts may be sold separately and assembled by a plumbing distributor.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

They are more often used in <a href="emergency" class="uri" title="wikilink">emergency</a>, <a href="rural" class="uri" title="wikilink">rural</a> and <a href="wilderness" class="uri" title="wikilink">wilderness</a> areas as well as in much of the <a href="developing_nation" title="wikilink">developing world</a>. The waste pit or trench, in some cases, will be large enough that the reduction in mass of the contained waste products by the ongoing process of <a href="decomposition" class="uri" title="wikilink">decomposition</a> allows the pit to be used more or less permanently. In other cases, when the pit becomes too full, it may be emptied or the hole covered with dirt. Pit toilets have to be located away from drinking water sources (wells, streams, etc.) to minimize the possibility of disease spread. Army units typically use a form of pit toilet when they are in the field and away from functional <a href="sewerage" class="uri" title="wikilink">sewerage</a> systems. The use of correctly located pit toilets were found to prevent much of the spread of various diseases which used to kill many more soldiers than the <a href="bullet" title="wikilink">bullets</a> and <a href="artillery" class="uri" title="wikilink">artillery</a> used in pre-1940 warfare.</p>

<h3 id="public-toilets">Public toilets</h3>

<p><img src="Limbourg_Ves1JPG.jpg" title="fig:Public urinal (Limbourg, Belgium)" alt="Public urinal (Limbourg, Belgium)" /> A <a href="public_toilet" title="wikilink">public toilet</a>, frequently called a restroom, is accessible to the general public. It may be within a building that, while privately owned, allows public access. Access to a public toilet may require a fee, (<a href="pay_toilet" title="wikilink">pay toilet</a>), or may be limited to business's customers.</p>
<p>Depending on culture, there may be varying degrees of separation between men and women and different levels of privacy. Typically, the entire room, or a stall or cubicle containing a toilet is lockable. <a href="Urinals" class="uri" title="wikilink">Urinals</a>, if present in a men's toilet, are typically mounted on wall with or without a divider between them. In the most basic form, a public toilet may be not much more than an open <a href="latrine" class="uri" title="wikilink">latrine</a>. Another form is a street urinal known as a <em>pissoir</em> after the French term<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> (see <a href="urinal_(restroom)" title="wikilink">Urinal</a>).</p>

They are typically self-contained units that are made to be easily moved to different locations as needed. Most portable toilets are <a href="unisex" class="uri" title="wikilink">unisex</a> single units with privacy ensured by a simple lock on the door. The units are usually light weight and easily transported by a <a href="flatbed_truck" title="wikilink">flatbed truck</a> and loaded and unloaded by a small <a href="forklift" class="uri" title="wikilink">forklift</a>. Many portable toilets are small molded plastic or <a href="fiberglass" class="uri" title="wikilink">fiberglass</a> portable rooms with a lockable door and a receptacle to catch waste in a chemically treated container. If used for an extended period of time they have to be cleaned out and new chemicals put in the waste receptacle. For servicing multiple portable toilets tanker trucks, often called <a href="Cesspool_emptier" title="wikilink">&quot;Honey Trucks&quot;</a>, are equipped with lage vacuums to evacuate the waste and replace the chemicals.</p>
<h3 id="high-tech-toilets">High-tech toilets</h3>

<h3 id="floating-toilets">Floating toilets</h3>
<p>A <em>floating toilet</em> is essentially an <a href="outhouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">outhouse</a> built on a platform built above or floating on the water. Instead of wastes going into the ground they are collected in a tank or barrel. To reduce the amount of waste that needs to hauled to shore, many use <a href="urine_diversion" title="wikilink">urine diversion</a>.

<h3 id="garderobes">Garderobes</h3>

<p>Garderobes were toilets used in the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a>, most commonly found in upper-class dwellings. Essentially, they were flat pieces of wood or stone spanning from one wall to the other, with one or more holes to sit on. These would go into pipes that would lead outside the <a href="castle" class="uri" title="wikilink">castle</a> or <a href="manor" class="uri" title="wikilink">manor</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Garderobes would be placed in areas away from bedrooms to shun the smell<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and also near kitchens or fireplaces to keep the enclosure warm.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="urinals">Urinals</h3>

<p>Although it is possible for <a href="urinal" title="wikilink">urinals</a> to be used by females, they were originally designed for males. They are intended for the disposal of liquid waste, not solid waste. Urinals are meant to be used for the convenience of male users in a standing position. They typically have no door or stall enclosure, and thus take up less space. These fixtures are most commonly found in public places, but can occasionally be found in a private home</p>

<h3 id="squat-toilets">Squat toilets</h3>

<p>The squat toilet (also called &lt;U+201C&gt;squatter&lt;U+201D&gt; or &lt;U+201C&gt;squatty-potty&lt;U+201D&gt;) consists of a hole in the ground. However, common modern versions flush like a modern seated toilet, and are not to be compared to a contemporary portable toilet with no plumbing. To use this toilet, one is in a squatting position rather than sitting, by placing one foot on each side of the toilet and squatting over it. Modern versions are in separate stalls when they are in public lavatories, and include toilet tissue rolls for the user's convenience. The squatting method is accompanied by advantages as well <a href="Squat_toilet#Advantages_of_squat_toilets" title="wikilink">health benefits</a> that connect to easiness of procedures such as child birth.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The squat toilet is most commonly found in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East but can also occasionally be found in some European (Romania), Mediterranean, and South American countries.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="toilet">Toilet</h3>
<p>The word <strong>toilet</strong> came to be used in English along with other French fashions. It originally referred to the <em>toile</em>, French for &quot;cloth&quot;, draped over a lady or gentleman's shoulders while their hair was being dressed, and then (in both French and English) by extension to the various elements, and also the whole complex of operations of <a href="hairdressing" class="uri" title="wikilink">hairdressing</a> and body care that centered at a dressing table, also covered by a cloth, on which stood a mirror and various brushes and containers for powder and make-up: this ensemble was also a <em><a href="toilette" class="uri" title="wikilink">toilette</a></em>, as also was the period spent at the table, during which close friends or tradesmen were often received.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The English poet <a href="Alexander_Pope" title="wikilink">Alexander Pope</a> in <em><a href="The_Rape_of_the_Lock" title="wikilink">The Rape of the Lock</a></em> (1717) described the intricacies of a lady's preparation.</p>
<p>The word <em>toilet</em> may also be used, especially in <a href="British_English" title="wikilink">British English</a> to describe the <a href="Toilet_(room)" title="wikilink">room containing the fixture</a>, for which <a href="euphemisms" class="uri" title="wikilink">euphemisms</a> such as <em>restroom</em> or <em>bathroom</em> are used in <a href="American_English" title="wikilink">American English</a>. Prior to the introduction of modern flush toilets, most human waste disposal was done through the use of household <a href="chamber_pot" title="wikilink">chamber pots</a>, or took place outdoors in <a href="outhouse" title="wikilink">outhouses</a> or <a href="latrines" class="uri" title="wikilink">latrines</a>. <a href="Pail_closet" title="wikilink">Pail closets</a> were introduced in England and France in an attempt to reduce sewage problems in rapidly expanding cities.</p>

<p>These various senses are first recorded by the <em><a href="OED" class="uri" title="wikilink">OED</a></em> in rapid sequence in the later 17th century: the set of &quot;articles required or used in dressing&quot; 1662, the &quot;action or process of dressing&quot; 1681, the cloth on the table 1682, the cloth round the shoulders 1684, the table itself 1695, and the &quot;reception of visitors by a lady during the concluding stages of her toilet&quot; 1703 (also known as a &quot;toilet-call&quot;), but in the sense of a special room the earliest use is 1819, and this does not seem to include a lavatory.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>Through the 18th century, everywhere in the English-speaking world, these various uses centred around a lady's draped dressing-table remained dominant. In the 19th century, apparently first in the United States,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> the word was adapted as a genteel euphemism for the room and the object as we know them now, perhaps following the French usage <em>cabinet de toilette</em>, much as <em>powder-room</em> may be coyly used today, and this has been linked to the introduction of public toilets, for example on railway <a href="train" title="wikilink">trains</a>, which required a plaque on the door. The original usages have become obsolete, and the table has become a <em>dressing-table</em>.</p>
<p>Vestiges of the original meaning continue to be reflected in terms such as <em>toiletries</em>, <em><a href="eau_de_toilette" title="wikilink">eau de toilette</a></em> and <em>toiletry bag</em> (to carry flannels, soaps, etc.). This seemingly contradictory terminology has served as the basis for various parodies e.g. <em><a href="Cosmopolitan_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Cosmopolitan</a></em> magazine (&quot;If it doesn't say 'eau de toilette' on the label, it most likely doesn't come from the famed region of Eau de Toilette in France and might not even come from toilets at all.&quot;)</p>
<p>The word <em>toilet</em> itself may be considered an impolite word in Anglophone North America, while elsewhere the word is used without any embarrassment. The choice of the word used instead of <em>toilet</em> is highly variable, not just by regional <a href="dialect" class="uri" title="wikilink">dialect</a> but also, at least in Britain, by <a href="social_class" title="wikilink">class</a> connotations. <a href="Nancy_Mitford" title="wikilink">Nancy Mitford</a> wrote an essay out of the choice of wording; see <a href="U_and_non-U_English" title="wikilink">U and non-U English</a>. Some manufacturers show this uneasiness with the word and its class attributes: <a href="American_Standard_Companies" title="wikilink">American Standard</a>, the largest manufacturer, sells them as &quot;toilets&quot;, yet the higher priced products of the <a href="Kohler_Company" title="wikilink">Kohler Company</a>, often installed in more expensive housing, are sold as <em><a href="commode" title="wikilink">commodes</a></em> or <em>closets</em>, words which also carry other meanings. Confusingly, products imported from Japan such as <a href="TOTO_(company)" title="wikilink">TOTO</a> are referred to as &quot;toilets&quot;, even though they carry the cachet of higher cost and quality. When referring to the room or the actual piece of equipment, the word <em>toilet</em> is often substituted with other <a href="euphemism" title="wikilink">euphemisms</a> and <a href="dysphemism" title="wikilink">dysphemisms</a> (See <em><a href="toilet_humor" title="wikilink">toilet humor</a></em>).</p>
<p>As old euphemisms have become accepted, they have been progressively replaced by newer ones, an example of the <a href="euphemism_treadmill" title="wikilink">euphemism treadmill</a> at work.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The choice of word used to describe the room or the piece of plumbing relies as much on regional variation (<a href="dialect" class="uri" title="wikilink">dialect</a>) as on social situation and level of formality (<a href="register_(sociolinguistics)" title="wikilink">register</a>).</p>
<h3 id="lavatory">Lavatory</h3>
<p>The term <strong>lavatory</strong>, abbreviated in slang to <strong>lav</strong>, derives from the , which in turn comes from Latin <em><a href="wikt:lav&lt;U+014D&gt;#Latin" title="wikilink">lav&lt;U+014D&gt;</a></em> (&quot;I wash&quot;). The word was originally used to refer to a vessel for washing, such as a <a href="sink" class="uri" title="wikilink">sink</a>/<a href="wash_basin" title="wikilink">wash basin</a>, but eventually came to mean a room with such washing vessels, as for example in medieval monasteries, where the <a href="lavatorium" class="uri" title="wikilink">lavatorium</a> was the monks' communal washing area.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The toilets in monasteries however were not in the <em>lavatorium</em> but in the <a href="reredorter" class="uri" title="wikilink">reredorter</a>. Nevertheless the word was later associated with toilets and the meaning evolved into its current one, namely a polite and formal euphemism for a toilet and the room containing it. <strong>Lavatory</strong> is the common <a href="signage" class="uri" title="wikilink">signage</a> for toilets on commercial airlines around the world, see <a href="Aircraft_lavatory" title="wikilink">Aircraft lavatory</a>.</p>
<h3 id="loo">Loo</h3>
<p>The origin of the (chiefly British) term <strong>loo</strong> is unknown. According to the OED, the etymology is obscure, but it might derive from the word Waterloo. The first recorded entry is in fact from <a href="James_Joyce" title="wikilink">James Joyce</a>'s <em><a href="Ulysses_(novel)" title="wikilink">Ulysses</a></em> (1922)'': &quot;O yes, mon loup. How much cost? Waterloo. Watercloset&quot;.</p>
<p>Other theories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>That it derives from the term &quot;gardyloo&quot; (a corruption of the French phrase <em>gardez l'eau!</em> (or maybe ) loosely translated as &quot;watch out for the water!&quot;) which was used in <a href="medieval" class="uri" title="wikilink">medieval</a> times when <a href="chamber_pot" title="wikilink">chamber pots</a> were emptied from a window onto the street. However the first recorded usage of &quot;loo&quot; comes long after this term became obsolete.</li>
<li>That the word comes from <a href="nautical" class="uri" title="wikilink">nautical</a> terminology, loo being an old-fashioned word for <a href="leeward" title="wikilink">lee</a>. The standard nautical pronunciation (in <a href="British_English" title="wikilink">British English</a>) of <em>leeward</em> is <em>looward</em>. Early ships were not fitted with toilets but the crew would urinate over the side of the vessel. However it was important to use the leeward side. Using the <a href="windward" class="uri" title="wikilink">windward</a> side would result in the urine blown back on board: hence the phrases 'pissing into the wind' and 'spitting into the wind'. Even now most yachtsmen refer to <em>the loo</em> rather than ''the <a href="head_(watercraft)" title="wikilink">heads''</a>.</li>
<li>That the word derives from the 17th century preacher <a href="Louis_Bourdaloue" title="wikilink">Louis Bourdaloue</a>. Bourdaloue's sermons at the Saint Paul-Saint Louis Church in Paris lasted at least three hours and myth has it that wealthier ladies took along &quot;travelling&quot; <a href="chamber_pot" title="wikilink">chamber pots</a> that could be hidden under their dresses whenever the need arose to avoid the need to leave. Due to the popularity of the myth the bowls became known as Bourdaloues after the preacher and the name became corrupted to portaloos and sometimes just plain loos due to the habit of shortening words in slang.</li>
<li>That the word comes from the French word <em>lieu</em> (place), as in <em>lieu d'aisance</em> (literally: &quot;place of ease&quot;, a common euphemism for lavatory) or <em>lieu &lt;U+00E0&gt; l'anglaise</em> (literally: &quot;English place&quot;). From around 1770 the term <em>lieu &lt;U+00E0&gt; l'anglaise</em> began to appear in France, referring to this English invention which was sometimes installed for the benefit of English visitors.

The etymology of the word is uncertain, but it is believed to be either derived from a corruption of &quot;necessity&quot; or from graffiti scrawled on <a href="Hadrian&#39;s_Wall" title="wikilink">Hadrian's Wall</a>.
