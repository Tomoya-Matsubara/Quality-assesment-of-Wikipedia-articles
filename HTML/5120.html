<h3 id="new-york-giants">New York Giants</h3>
<p>Cohen's success in the <a href="Texas_League" title="wikilink">Texas League</a> drew the attention of <a href="John_McGraw" title="wikilink">John McGraw</a>, manager of the <a href="San_Francisco_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a>, who had been looking to sign a Jewish player to help draw crowds to compete with the <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a> and <a href="Babe_Ruth" title="wikilink">Babe Ruth</a> playing across the <a href="Harlem_River" title="wikilink">Harlem River</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In May 1926, the Giants purchased Cohen's contract for $20,000 from the <a href="Waco,_Texas" title="wikilink">Waco</a> team in the Texas League.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Cohen debuted in a May 31, 1926, game against the <a href="Philadelphia_Phillies" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Phillies</a>, with a <a href="pinch_hit" title="wikilink">pinch hit</a> single to <a href="center_field" title="wikilink">center field</a> batting for <a href="Frankie_Frisch" title="wikilink">Frankie Frisch</a>, and an assist in the field.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Cohen batted .257 in 32 games with the Giants in the 1926 season, with 9 hits (including a triple) in 35 <a href="at_bat" title="wikilink">at bats</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Cohen played 10 games at second, 10 as <a href="shortstop" class="uri" title="wikilink">shortstop</a>, and two at <a href="third_base" title="wikilink">third base</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> McGraw gave Cohen the option to stay with the team, but Cohen chose to be sent to Buffalo of the <a href="International_League" title="wikilink">International League</a>, where he would have an opportunity to be an everyday player.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="The_Sporting_News" title="wikilink">The Sporting News</a> wrote that he had: &quot;all the natural characteristics (physically) of his race &lt;U+2014&gt; thick, dark hair, dark skin and keen mentality.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>With the slot at second base filled by <a href="Rogers_Hornsby" title="wikilink">Rogers Hornsby</a> with the parent team, Cohen spent the 1927 season in Buffalo, with his .353 batting average leading the team to a league title.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> He was warmly welcomed by Buffalo's Jewish community, which held an &quot;Andy Cohen Day&quot; in which he was bestowed with gifts, including a diamond ring from fans and a black onyx ring from a jewelry store, among other gifts.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Hornsby had played 155 games at second base in the 1927 season, but he was traded by the Giants to the <a href="Atlanta_Braves" title="wikilink">Boston Braves</a> in January 1928, freeing up a slot for Cohen.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> With the <a href="Mayor_of_New_York_City" title="wikilink">Mayor of New York City</a>, <a href="Jimmy_Walker" title="wikilink">Jimmy Walker</a>, on hand to throw out the first ball at the 1928 Opening Day game, Cohen led the Giants to a 5–3 victory over the Boston Braves, hitting two singles and a double, knocking in two runs, and scoring two.

<p>He was part of a <a href="vaudeville" class="uri" title="wikilink">vaudeville</a> act, telling jokes and singing parodies with <a href="Shanty_Hogan" title="wikilink">Shanty Hogan</a>, an Irish teammate from the Giants who played <a href="catcher" class="uri" title="wikilink">catcher</a> for the team. After the 1928 season they started performing on the Loew Circuit, with their first appearance on stage at the Loew's Commodore Theatre in the <a href="Manhattan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a> on October 15, 1928.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The duo earned $1,800 a week, billed as &quot;Cohen &amp; Hogan&quot;, except in <a href="Boston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boston</a>, when the billings were reversed.

<p>Cohen batted .294 in 101 games with the Giants in the 1929 season, hitting 12 doubles, two triples, and five home runs, and playing what turned out to be his final major league game on October 5, 1929.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The Giants sent Cohen to Newark during the 1929 season, to help refine Cohen's fielding. Cohen batted .318 and set an International League record with 59 consecutive errorless games.
