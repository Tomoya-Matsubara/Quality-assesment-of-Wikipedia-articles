<p><a href="Cleveland_Brown" title="wikilink">Cleveland</a> is excited to have a new family, but his step-kids don't warm up to him. He finds out from Donna about a father-daughter dance, the Daddy-Daughter Dinner Dance, and tries to coax his new step-daughter <a href="Roberta_Tubbs" title="wikilink">Roberta</a> into going with him. She is at first annoyed and unwilling to go, but eventually accepts when he buys her a set of diamond earrings. Cleveland decides to buy a cake to celebrate. As he backs out of the driveway, he accidentally runs over the family dog, <a href="Meadowlark_Lemon" title="wikilink">Meadowlark Lemon</a>. In an attempt to keep this a secret, Cleveland allows his neighbor Lester to dispose of the body. Lester later eats the dog. Cleveland realizes that he has to tell his family after being advised by Tim. They are shocked and angry. Roberta refuses to go to the dance with her step-dad, and instead wants to go with her father Robert. He attempts to patch things up by buying a new dog but Rallo says that his dog is not replaceable. Cleveland angrily tells Rallo to move on before going to be there for Roberta. He arrives at the high school to find out that Robert has bailed out on Roberta again, so he goes to the dance anyways to be there for Roberta.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, after being seen kissing his dad goodbye on the cheek, <a href="Cleveland_Brown,_Jr." title="wikilink">Cleveland Jr.</a> is harassed by everyone at school, including the gym teacher, calling him Beth, until the students find him useful as a &quot;door&quot; for the doorless stalls in the boys' bathroom. This leads to Junior becoming a self-appointed <a href="bathroom_attendant" title="wikilink">bathroom attendant</a>, until Cleveland finds out and tells him to stop it because he looks like &quot;a racist cliche in a <a href="Ron_Howard" title="wikilink">Ron Howard</a> movie.&quot; He tells his son to boil his clothes and that tomorrow he will teach him how to play baseball.</p>
