After <em>Paradise Beach</em> she had casual work on <em><a href="Hey_Hey_It&#39;s_Saturday" title="wikilink">Hey Hey It's Saturday</a></em> before she co-hosted the popular <a href="Seven_Network" title="wikilink">Seven Network</a> series <em><a href="Gladiators_(Australian_TV_series)" title="wikilink">Gladiators</a></em>.</p>

In 1999, she moved to the United States to study acting at the <a href="Atlantic_Theater_Company" title="wikilink">Atlantic Theater Company</a> in New York, before spending 18 months trying for auditions in Los Angeles. In 2001, she was cast as Jo Ellison in the British television series <em><a href="Cold_Feet" title="wikilink">Cold Feet</a></em>. She appeared in the fourth and fifth series and returned to Australia two days after filming the final episode in 2002. In 2004, she appeared in a major recurring role as Dr. Grace Connelly in six episodes of the Australian soap opera <em><a href="All_Saints_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">All Saints</a></em>. She returned to America after filming <em>All Saints</em>, where she got a small role as flight attendant <a href="Characters_of_Lost#Minor_Oceanic_815_crash_survivors" title="wikilink">Cindy Chandler</a> in the pilot episode of <em><a href="Lost_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Lost</a></em>. The role was supposed to be a one-off in the pilot but a producer liked Joseph and the character, so brought her back for a recurring role in the second and third seasons.</p>

<p>At the age of 19, Joseph dropped out of university when she got the part of Cassie Barsby in the <a href="soap_opera" title="wikilink">soap opera</a> <em><a href="Paradise_Beach" title="wikilink">Paradise Beach</a></em>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Like many of the cast she had no formal acting training, though she turned this to her advantage with &quot;exuberance and energy&quot;.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The short-lived soap was on Australian screens for 15 months before being cancelled but Joseph gained experience and friendships with <a href="Raelee_Hill" title="wikilink">Raelee Hill</a>, <a href="Megan_Connolly" title="wikilink">Megan Connolly</a>, and <a href="Isla_Fisher" title="wikilink">Isla Fisher</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> After <em>Paradise Beach</em> ended, she began appearing in the <a href="Nine_Network" title="wikilink">Nine Network</a> variety show <em><a href="Hey_Hey_It&#39;s_Saturday" title="wikilink">Hey Hey It's Saturday</a></em>. Joseph had no contract with Nine, and was making the appearances because she was friends with host <a href="Daryl_Somers" title="wikilink">Daryl Somers</a>. Nine Network executives wanted to make her a regular on the show and began using her in publicity material, however, rival network <a href="Seven_Network" title="wikilink">Seven</a> offered her a contract to co-host <em><a href="Gladiators_(Australian_TV_series)" title="wikilink">Gladiators</a></em> before Nine could make her <em>Hey Hey</em> contract permanent. Her defection to Nine in 1995 caused a small scandal.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> She described hosting <em>Gladiators</em> as &quot;tough and scary&quot; on account of the live audience.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> She appeared for two series and some international specials before taking the role of Joanne Brennan in <em><a href="Home_and_Away" title="wikilink">Home and Away</a></em> in an effort to get away from presenting.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The character, a secretary who dealt drugs to school children, appeared from 1995 to 1996.

<p>Unitl 1999, she worked as a &quot;jobbing actress&quot;, making appearances in <em><a href="Hercules:_the_Legendary_Journeys" title="wikilink">Hercules: the Legendary Journeys</a></em> and <em><a href="Sale_of_the_Century_(Australian_game_show)" title="wikilink">Sale of the Century</a></em>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Eager to move away from soap opera acting, Joseph moved to the United States to study acting with the <a href="Atlantic_Theater_Company" title="wikilink">Atlantic Theater Company</a> in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> She then moved to <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> where she spent 18 months living off her savings trying to get auditions.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> In those 18 months, her only jobs were a single commericial and a job interviewing LA-based film actors for Australian television.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In 2001, her lawyer informed her that she would have to travel to <a href="Sydney,_Australia" title="wikilink">Sydney</a> to be interviewed for her <a href="Permanent_residence_(United_States)" title="wikilink">green card</a>. On the day she was due to fly back to Australia, her agent informed her of an audition for the British television series <em><a href="Cold_Feet" title="wikilink">Cold Feet</a></em>, whose producer was looking for an Australian actress to become a new main cast member. Two weeks later she had moved to <a href="Manchester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manchester</a> and was doing script read-throughs with the rest of the cast.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Her character, Jo Ellison, appeared in all episodes of the <a href="Cold_Feet_(series_4)" title="wikilink">fourth</a> and <a href="Cold_Feet_(series_5)" title="wikilink">fifth</a> series. Two days after filming the final episode in 2002, Joseph left Britain and returned to Australia.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2004, she appeared on Australian television for the first time since a regular role in <em>Tales of the South Seas</em> in 1999, playing Dr. Grace Connelly for six episodes on <em><a href="All_Saints_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">All Saints</a></em>. The day after she completed filming of her scenes, she returned to Los Angeles for the pilot season.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> She got a small part as a flight attendant in the <a href="Pilot_(Lost)" title="wikilink">pilot episode</a> of <em><a href="Lost_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Lost</a></em>. Joseph's scenes, on an airplane set, were filmed over two and a half days in Los Angeles. An early script draft of the pilot called for her character to be seen dead on a beach, though subsequent rewrites removed the scene. A producer liked Joseph and her character, and planned to bring both back to the series at a later date. She returned at the beginning of the <a href="Lost_(season_2)" title="wikilink">second season</a>, when it was revealed that her character, given the name <a href="Characters_of_Lost#Minor_Oceanic_815_crash_survivors" title="wikilink">Cindy Chandler</a>, had survived the plane crash in the pilot episode along with other passengers from the tail section of the plane. Despite being asked not to change her appearance too much after the pilot, Joseph had her haircut, so in her first few episodes of the second season, she had to &quot;go through the whole debacle of putting a Rambo scarf around [her] head, which just looked ridiculous.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Her episodes for season 2 were filmed over five weeks and were broadcast in 2005.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Her character was abducted in the middle of an episode and was not seen again until in the <a href="Lost_(season_3)" title="wikilink">third season</a>, when Joseph reprised the role for two episodes and the whereabouts of her character are revealed. She has a minor role in <em><a href="Angels_&amp;_Demons_(film)" title="wikilink">Angels &amp; Demons</a></em>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
