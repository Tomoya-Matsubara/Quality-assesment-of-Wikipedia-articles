<p>The <strong><a href="Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Republic of Ireland</a></strong> does not recognize <strong><a href="civil_union" title="wikilink">civil unions</a></strong> or <a href="same-sex_marriage" title="wikilink">same-sex marriages</a> and there is very little provision for unmarried <a href="cohabitation" title="wikilink">cohabiting</a> couples, whether <a href="homosexuality" title="wikilink">homosexual</a> or <a href="heterosexuality" title="wikilink">heterosexual</a>. The situation has been under investigation by various Government bodies since <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a>. In January <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, <a href="Taoiseach" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taoiseach</a> <a href="Bertie_Ahern" title="wikilink">Bertie Ahern</a> endorsed the report of an <a href="Oireachtas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oireachtas</a> committee which recommended registered Civil Partnerships. A Government working group recommended in November 2006 that full civil partnership would address the majority of issues. The Government has said that it plans to enact legislation following the report of this group.</p>
<p>The 2002 <a href="Ireland" title="wikilink">Irish</a> census revealed cohabiting couples had almost doubled since 1996 to 77,000 families and this included 1,300 in same-sex relationships.</p>
<h2 id="current-legal-position">Current legal position</h2>
<p>Some test cases were taken in the 1990s challenging the legal non-recognition, but were not successful. Examples are those of a man who sought to use his partners free-travel rights, and of a man whose partner, the leaseholder of their residence, died.</p>
<p>In March 2004, there was controversy in the D&lt;U+00E1&gt;il surrounding a definition of 'spouse' when it was claimed that the <a href="Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs_(Ireland)" title="wikilink">Minister for Social and Family Affairs</a>, <a href="Mary_Coughlan" title="wikilink">Mary Coughlan</a> was seeking to exclude non-married partners from Social welfare legislation <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> . The exclusion was a Government response to a finding by the Equality Tribunal that a gay couple was discriminated against in travel privileges.</p>
<p>In 2004, section 2(2)(e) of the Civil Registration Act set out what was previously the common law exclusion of same sex couples from the institution of marriage.</p>
<p>In a <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a> case, &quot;Karner v Austria&quot;, the <a href="European_Court_of_Human_Rights" title="wikilink">European Court of Human Rights</a> held that cohabiting same-sex partners are entitled to the same rights as unmarried cohabiting opposite-sex partners <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> in certain circumstances. However there are currently no defined rights for any cohabiting partners in Ireland.</p>
<p>During his November 2004 nomination hearings, <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a> Justice <a href="European_Commission" title="wikilink">Commissioner</a> <a href="Franco_Frattini" title="wikilink">Franco Frattini</a> said that states are obliged to recognise the family life of couples in non-marital relationships under the provisions regarding free-movement of people from one state to another in the <a href="Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union" title="wikilink">EU Charter of Fundamental Rights</a>. The charter has been incorporated into the proposed <a href="European_Constitution" title="wikilink">European Constitution</a> which would give it a legal basis under the <a href="European_Court_of_Justice" title="wikilink">European Court of Justice</a> <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> . In <a href="May_2006" title="wikilink">May 2006</a> a reform of EU residency rules took effect, including the right of gay couples to reside anywhere in the EU and have their relationship 'facilitated' <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> .</p>
<p>In <a href="January_2006" title="wikilink">January 2006</a>, the Irish Equality Authority suggested that there is a legal requirement on the Irish Government under the <a href="Belfast_Agreement" title="wikilink">Belfast Agreement</a> to provide the same level of human rights as in Northern Ireland, where <a href="Civil_partnerships_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">UK Civil Partnerships</a> have been available since <a href="December_2005" title="wikilink">December 2005</a>.</p>
<p>In a December 2006 judgement in the 'KAL Case' (see below), the Irish High Court held that marriage as defined in the Irish Constitution was between a man and a woman and that there was no breach of rights in the refusal of the Revenue Commissioners to recognise foreign same-sex marriages.</p>
<h2 id="public-debate">Public debate</h2>
<p>Since the decriminalization of homosexual sex in 1993, there have been no high-profile <a href="gay_rights" title="wikilink">gay rights</a> campaigns in Ireland. However Irish media has increasingly covered international developments in the same-sex partnerships issue <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> , particularly since 2001. This has included coverage of reports on the issue, legal cases taken by gay Irish couples, surrogate parenthood <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> , adoption <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> , extra-legal same-sex unions, blessings and the foreign partnerships of Irish politicians <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> . There was extensive coverage of the 2005 introduction of Civil Partnerships in the UK <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> , which applies to Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Irish Legislators began to comment publicly from 2003 <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> , demonstrating some awareness of the issues involved and tentatively suggesting legislation, but some also referring to Catholic teachings <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> . There has been no significant public adverse reaction, with a 2005 online poll showing most respondents seeing some recognition as inevitable and acceptable <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> . More rigorous public polls taken during 2006 <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> <a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> <a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> showed an increasing majority of the population, up to 80%, supporting the introduction of some partnership rights for gay couples, with a slim majority favouring full marriage. The numbers in favour of <a href="gay_adoption" title="wikilink">gay adoption</a> were lower but less clear.</p>
<p>Some public and religious figures, including bishops in the Catholic Church <a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and in the Church of Ireland <a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> , have also proposed legal recognition, but in a form different to marriage.</p>
<p>During the <a href="Irish_general_election,_2002" title="wikilink">May 2002 General Election</a> campaign, the manifesto of the <a href="Green_Party_(Ireland)" title="wikilink">Green Party</a> was the only one to explicitly referred to the rights of gay couples. In June 2004, <a href="Fine_Gael" title="wikilink">Fine Gael</a> launched Partnership registration proposals <a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and in November 2004, in reaction to the legal challenge on tax issues <a href="Taoiseach" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taoiseach</a> and <a href="Fianna_F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il" title="wikilink">Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il</a> leader <a href="Bertie_Ahern" title="wikilink">Bertie Ahern</a> said <em>&quot;Couples want equality and we should try to deal with some of those issues&quot;</em> but added that moves to legalise gay marriage are <em>&quot;a long way off&quot;</em> <a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> . <a href="Irish_Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" title="wikilink">Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</a> <a href="Michael_McDowell" title="wikilink">Michael McDowell</a> of the <a href="Progressive_Democrats" title="wikilink">Progressive Democrats</a> said in 2004 that Ireland should pursue civil partnerships. On December 14th, 2006, the Labour party launched their civil union bill<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>. The Green Party's policy on same-sex marriage and partnership rights was launched on 12th October 2006. <a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-kal-recognition-case">The 'KAL' Recognition Case</h2>
<p>In November 2004 lesbian couple Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan (K &amp; AL) were granted leave by the <a href="Courts_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Irish High Court</a> to pursue a claim to have their September 2003 <a href="Same-sex_marriage_in_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">Vancouver marriage</a> recognised for the filing of joint tax returns in Ireland <a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> . Justice McKechnie said that the case was significant and would embrace far-reaching issues touching many aspects of society. Lead barrister, Gerard Hogan, argued that neither the 1937 Irish constitution nor more recent tax laws specifically define marriage as between one man and one woman. Following a delay, the Government announced in April 2005 that it would contest the case on the basis of advice from the Attorney General that it would prevail. The case has attracted international attention and was reported by <a href="The_Boston_Globe" title="wikilink">The Boston Globe</a> in December 2005 <a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> . The couple were also interviewed on the <a href="The_Late_Late_Show" title="wikilink">The Late Late Show</a> <a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The court case began on October 3, 2006 <a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> and concluded on October 13. Judgement <a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> was delivered on the 14th December, 2006 <a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a>. Ms. Justice Dunne found that although a 'living document', the Irish constitution had always meant for marriage to be between a man and a woman, that the definitions used in the Civil Registration Act of 2004 was an expression of the current attitudes of the state and that she could find no reason to change that. Further, she found that the constitution did not violate the plaintiffs rights under European law. The judgement did say, however, that the topic is very much in the news and that there were undoubtedly difficultes and hardships for same-sex and unmarried hetrosexual couples and that</p>
<dl>

<dd><em>&quot;It is to be hoped that the legislative changes to ameliorate these difficulties will not be long in coming. Ultimately, it is for the legislature to determine the extent to which such changes should be made.&quot;</em>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The case will be appealed to the Supreme Court</p>
<h2 id="law-reform-commission">Law Reform Commission</h2>
<p>In December 2000, as part of the Second Programme of Law Reform, the Government requested the Law Reform Commission of Ireland to examine the Rights and Duties of co-habitees. In April 2004, the commission published a consultation paper <a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> with provisional recommendations on legal issues related to cohabiting relationships <a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> <a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> . The report included an analysis of issues for same-sex couples. Following responses, the final report <a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> was launched in December 2006 by Justice Minster McDowell. <a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> .</p>
<p>The consultation proposals called for legal 'presumed' recognition of <em>qualifying</em> cohabiting relationships. <em>Qualifying Cohabitees</em> were defined as unmarried same-sex or opposite-sex cohabiting couples in a 'marriage-like' relationships of 2 years (or 3 years in some cases), to be determined by the courts.</p>
<p>The commission reviewed such areas as property, succession, maintenance, pensions, social welfare and tax and recommended some changes in the law to provide rights for qualifying co-habitees. These rights would be applied by the court on application as distinct from the 'automatic' rights of legal marriage. The commission took care not to propose anything which would equate co-habitation with marriage due to concerns that such a proposal might violate the constitutional protection of the family.</p>
<p>The paper also included recommendations on other steps that cohabiting couples should take such writing wills, defining power of attorney etc.</p>
<h2 id="other-statutory-bodies-and-ngos">Other Statutory Bodies and NGOs</h2>
<p>Since 2002, various statutory bodies have issued reports calling for recognition of homosexual and de-facto heterosexual relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Equality Authority:</strong> In Jan 2001, the authority produced a report on Same-sex partnerships in Ireland <a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> which it had commissioned to inform its own debate. In May 2002, the Equality Authority issued its formal report on Equality for Lesbians Gays and Bisexuals <a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> which highlighted the lack of recognition for same-sex couples in Irish law. In a departure from the norm, the report recommended legislative changes. These were to give legal recognition to same-sex couples, to provide equality with married couples in the areas of adoption, inheritance and taxation to eliminate discrimination.</p>
<p><strong>NESF:</strong> In April 2003, the National Economic and Social Forum (NESF) published Report 27 <a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> - The implementation of Equality policies for Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual people. The recommendations included calls for the Law Reform Commission to consider models to achieve equal rights for same-sex couples in its then upcoming report.</p>
<p><strong>Human Rights Commission:</strong> In a report on de facto couples <a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> presented to the Justice Minister in May 2006, the Irish Human Rights Commission evaluated international standards in dealing with unmarried couples, and assessed the changes needed in Irish law from a human rights perspective <a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> . They called for legal recognition of all de facto relationships, but did not call for civil marriage to be made available to same-sex couples.</p>
<p><strong>Irish Council for Civil Liberties:</strong> Legal recognition of partnership rights and addressing inequalities in family law are a strategic objective of the ICCL for 2004-2009 <a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> . In a <a href="December_2004" title="wikilink">December 2004</a> submission, they welcomed the Law Reform proposals <a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> but said that registered unions were necessary. In a radio interview in 2005 the parterships officer said that full civil marriage would not be likely to succeed in a referendum. However, their <a href="May_2006" title="wikilink">May 2006</a> report on the issue - &quot;Equality for All Families&quot; <ref> </p>
<p></ref> , launched by ICCL founder <a href="Kader_Asmal" title="wikilink">Kader Asmal</a>, called for legislated partnership registration and revisions to the constitutional provisions on civil marriage and the family, to give improved protection to children. This revision, which would require a referendum, should include a right to marry irrespective of sexual orientation. <a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> .</p>
<h2 id="the-constitutional-review">The constitutional review</h2>
<p>The All-Party <a href="Oireachtas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oireachtas</a> Committee on the <a href="Constitution_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Constitution</a> <a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> , re-established in December 2002, has been conducting a review of the entire constitution. In October 2004 it invited submissions on the Articles related to the family <a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> . Chairman <a href="Denis_O&#39;Donovan" title="wikilink">Denis O'Donovan</a> TD stated that it was examining these Articles <em>to ascertain the extent to which they are serving the good of individuals and the community, with a view to deciding whether changes in them would bring about a greater balance between the two</em>. Among the many issues raised by the committee were the definition of the family and the rights of gay couples to marry.</p>
<p>The relevant provisions are Articles 40.3, 41 and 42</p>
<dl>

<dd><strong>Article 41</strong>
</dd>
<dd>1&lt;U+00B0&gt; <em>The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage, on which the family is founded, and to protect it against attack.</em>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The committee held oral hearings in Spring 2005 <a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> <a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> and received an unexpectedly large volume of written submissions with at least 60% being opposed to any constitutional changes to marriage or the family. The final report <a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> , the Tenth interim report of the committee, originally due in September 2005, was launched by Taoiseach Ahern on 24 January 2006 <a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> . It recommended no change to the constitutional definitions, as it expected such a referendum to fail. It suggested that there should instead be legislation for a civil partnership registration open to homosexual or heterosexual couples which would confer succession, maintenance and taxation rights. Controversially, it also recommended that the 'presumed' recognition of co-habiting partners by the courts, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, should also be legislated for, but only for heterosexual couples. The basis for the limitation was that it would be easy for the courts to determine the validity of a male/female relationship if there were children.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-legislation">Enabling Legislation</h2>
<h3 id="the-norris-bill-of-2004">The Norris bill of 2004</h3>
<p>In 2003 Independent <a href="Senator" class="uri" title="wikilink">Senator</a> <a href="David_Norris_(campaigner)" title="wikilink">David Norris</a> began work on legislation for the recognition of unmarried partnerships. As a result, the Senator introduced a private members bill <a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> in December 2004 in the <a href="Seanad_&lt;U+00C9&gt;ireann" title="wikilink">Seanad</a>. Introduction of a bill in the Seanad is an unusual step, last taken some 50 years earlier. In the 1970's and 1980's Senator Norris was central to the <a href="Campaign_for_Homosexual_Law_Reform" title="wikilink">Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform</a> and its case in the <a href="European_Court_of_Human_Rights" title="wikilink">European Court of Human Rights</a>.</p>
<p>The bill defines eligibility for a civil partnership and the process of registering a civil partnership. Rather than listing all the rights of a civil partner, it specifies that all the rights of marriage would apply to anyone in a civil partnership. However it specifically defines the dissolution process. It also defines the process for recognising foreign civil partnerships.</p>
<p>The second-stage debate took place on <a href="16_February" title="wikilink">16 February</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a> <a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> and included contributions from Justice Minister McDowell. While there was little controversy on the content of the bill itself, rancour surrounded a Government amendment designed to postpone a vote. This postponement was to allow for input and advices from the Law Reform Commission, the High court Case on Recognition of the Canadian Marriage and the Constitutional Review committee. After some discussion it was agreed to hold a debate on the bill but adjourn a vote indefinitely.</p>
<p>The majority of Senators who spoke in the two-hour debate supported the principles behind the bill and complimented Senator Norris on his work. Some expressed reservations regarding the Constitutional protection of the family. According to Senator Norris, the Bill was initiated <em>&quot;to protect the rights of adults who find themselves in relationships outside the conventional bonds of marriage&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;to meet the requirements of those who are making arrangements in their personal lives outside the formalities of marriage&quot;</em> and who also <em>&quot;need to be supported in the creation of mature stable relationships&quot;</em>. The bill is to cover both same-sex and opposite-sex cohabiting couples. Norris also said he had done substantial research in order to achieve consensus on a moderate bill which took on board stated reservations.</p>
<h3 id="labour-party-bill-2006">Labour Party Bill 2006</h3>
<p>In December 2006, on the same day as the judgment in the KAL case, the opposition Labour Party launched a Civil Unions Bill <a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> specifically for same-sex couples, in the Dail, which they hope will be debated early in 2007. <a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="department-of-justice-working-group">Department of Justice working group</h2>
<p>On December 20, 2005, Justice Minister Michael McDowell announced that he was creating a working group in the Department of Justice to provide options for government consideration <a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> . This announcement came on the day after <a href="Belfast" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belfast</a> in Northern Ireland held the first of the new UK Civil Partnership registration ceremonies.</p>
<p>Chaired by former TD <a href="Anne_Colley" title="wikilink">Anne Colley</a>, this working group included GLEN, the gay rights lobby organisation, who said they expected a recommendation for civil marriage. The group facilitated a conference on the topic in May 2006, as input to its reports which was attended by experts from other countries which have introduced civil unions and gay marriage. During his speech, Minister McDowell was interrupted by members of the Ancient Order of Hibernians shouting opposition to the Government plans <a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Initially to report by March 2006, the group presented its report <a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> to Government in November 2006 <a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a>. . They recommended that a civil parternship scheme would resolve most of the issues for same-sex and cohabiting couples, while providing less benefits than marriage. Offering civil marriage to gay couples would be open to constitutional challenge. They also recommended a legal presumption of partnership for couples which have lived together for three years, or have children together. No recommendations were made for couples in non-<a href="conjugal" class="uri" title="wikilink">conjugal</a> relationships due to lack of research. The cabinet has reviewed the report, and Government had previously said that it would enact legislation in response, but the Taoiseach has also said that there will not be time to do this before the <a href="30th_Irish_general_election" title="wikilink">next general election</a>.</p>
