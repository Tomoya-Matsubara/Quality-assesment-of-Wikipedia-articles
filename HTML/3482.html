<p><strong>Lie Kim Hok</strong> (; 1 November 1853 &lt;U+2013&gt; 6 May 1912) was a <a href="Chinese_Indonesian" title="wikilink"><em>peranakan</em> Chinese</a> teacher, writer, and <a href="social_work" title="wikilink">social worker</a> active in the <a href="Dutch_East_Indies" title="wikilink">Dutch East Indies</a>. Born in <a href="Bogor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bogor</a>, <a href="West_Java" title="wikilink">West Java</a>, Lie received his formal education in missionary schools and by the 1870s was fluent in <a href="Sundanese_language" title="wikilink">Sundanese</a>, <a href="Malay_trade_and_creole_languages" title="wikilink">vernacular Malay</a>, and <a href="Dutch_language" title="wikilink">Dutch</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; he was unable to understand <a href="Chinese_language" title="wikilink">Chinese</a>. In the mid-1870s Lie married and edited two periodicals published by his teacher and mentor D. J. van der Linden; after his wife died Lie quit this position. In 1884 Lie published his first books, including the critically acclaimed <em><a href="syair" class="uri" title="wikilink">syair</a></em> (poem) <em><a href="Sair_Tjerita_Siti_Akbari" title="wikilink">Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari</a></em> and grammar <em><a href="Malajoe_Batawi" title="wikilink">Malajoe Batawi</a></em>. When van der Linden died in 1885, Lie purchased the printing press and opened his own company.</p>
<p>Over the following two years Lie published numerous books, including <em><a href="Tjhit_Liap_Seng" title="wikilink">Tjhit Liap Seng</a></em>, considered the first Chinese Malay novel; Lie also acquired printing rights for <em><a href="Pembrita_Betawi" title="wikilink">Pembrita Betawi</a></em>, a newspaper based in Batavia (now <a href="Jakarta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jakarta</a>) and moved to the city. After he sold his printing press in 1887, Lie spent three years working various odd jobs until he found stability at a rice mill operated by his friend in 1890. The following year he married Tan Sioe Nio; the couple had four children. Lie published two books in the 1890s and, in 1900, became a founding member of the Chinese organisation <a href="Tiong_Hoa_Hwe_Koan" title="wikilink">Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan</a>, which he left in 1904. Lie focused on his translations and social work for the remainder of his life, until his death of <a href="typhus" class="uri" title="wikilink">typhus</a> at age 58.</p>
<p>Lie has been considered influential in the colony's journalism, linguistics, and literature; he is best remembered for his contributions to the latter field, having been styled the &quot;father of Chinese Malay literature&quot; in recognition of his work. Several of his writings saw multiple printings, and <em>Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari</em> was adapted for the stage and <a href="Siti_Akbari" title="wikilink">film</a>. However, as a result of the <a href="language_politics" title="wikilink">language politics</a> in the Indies and independent Indonesia he has become marginalised. When several of his writings were revealed as uncredited adaptations of exisiting works, Lie was criticised as unoriginal. This conclusion has been debated by several critics, who have found evidence of innovation in Lie's writing style and handling of plots.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Lie was born in <a href="Bogor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bogor</a>, <a href="West_Java" title="wikilink">West Java</a>, on 1 November 1853, the first child of seven born to Lie Hian Tjouw and his second wife Oey Tjiok Nio; the elder Lie had four children from a previous marriage. The well-to-do <a href="Chinese_Indonesians" title="wikilink"><em>peranakan</em> Chinese</a> couple was living in <a href="Cianjur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cianjur</a> at the time but had gone to Bogor to give birth as they had family there. The family soon returned to Cianjur, where Lie Kim Hok was <a href="homeschooling" title="wikilink">homeschooled</a> in <a href="Chinese_tradition" title="wikilink">Chinese tradition</a> and the local <a href="Sundanese_people" title="wikilink">Sundanese</a> culture and <a href="Sundanese_language" title="wikilink">language</a>. By age seven he could haltingly read Sundanese and <a href="Malay_language" title="wikilink">Malay</a>.</p>
<p>In the mid-18th century the colony's ethnic Chinese population was severely undereducated, unable to enter schools for Europeans or <a href="native_Indonesians" title="wikilink">natives</a>. At age ten he was enrolled in a <a href="Calvinist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calvinist</a> <a href="missionary" class="uri" title="wikilink">missionary</a> school run by Christiaan Albers. This school had roughly 60 male students, mostly Chinese. Under Albers, a fluent speaker of Sundanese, Lie received his formal education, including the sciences, language, and Christianty &lt;U+2013&gt; the schools were meant to promote Christianity in the <a href="Dutch_East_Indies" title="wikilink">Dutch East Indies</a>, and students were required to pray before class. Lie &lt;U+2013&gt; as with most students &lt;U+2013&gt; did not convert, although biographer <a href="Tio_Ie_Soei" title="wikilink">Tio Ie Soei</a> writes that the religion likely affected his <a href="world_view" title="wikilink">world view</a>.</p>
<p><img src="Raden_Saleh.jpg" title="fig:Lie studied painting under Raden Saleh." alt="Lie studied painting under Raden Saleh." /> Lie and his family returned to Bogor in 1866. At the time there were no schools offering a European-style education in the city, and thus Lie was sent to a Chinese-run school. For three years, in which Lie studied under three different headmasters, he was made to repeat traditional <a href="Hokkien_dialect" title="wikilink">Hokkien</a> phrases and copy <a href="Chinese_character" title="wikilink">Chinese characters</a> without understanding them. Tio suggests that Lie obtained little knowledge at the school, and until his death Lie was unable to speak <a href="Chinese_language" title="wikilink">Chinese</a>. During his time in Bogor Lie studied painting under <a href="Raden_Saleh" title="wikilink">Raden Saleh</a>, a friend of his father's. Although he reportedly showed skill, he did not continue the hobby as his mother disapproved. He also showed a propensity for traditional literary forms such as <em><a href="pantun" class="uri" title="wikilink">pantun</a></em>.</p>
<p>When <a href="Sierk_Coolsma" title="wikilink">Sierk Coolsma</a> opened a missionary school on 31 May 1869, Lie was in the first class of ten. Once again studying in Sundanese, Lie studied similar subjects to his time in Cianjur; around this time he began studying <a href="Dutch_language" title="wikilink">Dutch</a>. After a government-run school opened in 1872, most of Lie's classmates were ethnic Chinese; the Sundanese students, mostly Muslim, had transferred to the new school for fear of being converted. In 1873 Coolsma was tasked to <a href="Sumedang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sumedang</a> to translate the Bible into Sundanese and was replaced by D. J. van der Linden. Studies resumed, using Malay as van der Linden was unable to speak Sundanese. Lie and his new headmaster soon became close. The two would work together at van der Linden's school and publishing house and shared an interest in the traditional theatre, including <em><a href="wayang" class="uri" title="wikilink">wayang</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="teacher-and-publisher">Teacher and publisher</h2>
<p>Lie had soon begun assisting van der Linden with the school, and in the mid-1870s operated his own for poor children. Lie likewise worked for the missionary's printing press, Zending Pers, earning forty <a href="Netherlands_Indies_gulden" title="wikilink">gulden</a> a month while serving as editor of two religious magazines, the Dutch-language monthly <em>De Opwekker</em> and the Malay-language bi-weekly <em>Bintang Djohor</em>.  In 1876 he married Oey Pek Nio, seven years his younger; Tio, in an interview with scholar of <a href="Chinese_Malay_literature" title="wikilink">Chinese Malay literature</a> Claudine Salmon, stated that Lie had been betrothed to Oey's elder sister , but when she ran away the night before the ceremony Lie was told to marry Oey Pek Nio to save face. Lie was displeased with the marriage, but followed through under his parent's urgings. The pair soon grew close, and the following year they had their first child; the baby died soon after birth. Lie's mother died in 1879, and his father died the following year.</p>
<p><img src="Sair_Tjerita_Siti_Akbari.jpg" title="fig:Cover of Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari, Lie&#39;s first published syair (poem)." alt="Cover of Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari, Lie&#39;s first published syair (poem)." /> Following these deaths Lie sold his school to Oey Kim Hoat and left his position at Zending Pers to ensure his family's financial stability. In 1881 Oey Pek Nio gave birth to another child, but <a href="Maternal_death" title="wikilink">died soon afterwards</a>. As Lie was unable to take care of the child, the baby was sent to live with Lie's father-in-law in Gadok, but died in 1886. Three years later Lie published his first books. Two of these, <em>Kitab Edja</em> and <em>Sobat Anak-Anak</em>, were published by Zending Pers; the former was a study book to help students learn to write Malay, while the latter was a collection of <a href="Children&#39;s_literature" title="wikilink">stories for children</a> which Aprinus Salam of <a href="Gadjah_Mada_University" title="wikilink">Gadjah Mada University</a> credits as the first work of <a href="popular_culture" title="wikilink">popular literature</a> in the Indies. The other two books were published by W. Bruining &amp; Co., based in the colonial capital at Batavia (now <a href="Jakarta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jakarta</a>). One of these, <em><a href="Malajoe_Batawi" title="wikilink">Malajoe Batawi</a></em>, was a grammar of Malay intended to standardise the language's spelling. The other was the four-volume <em><a href="syair" class="uri" title="wikilink">syair</a></em> (poem) <em><a href="Sair_Tjerita_Siti_Akbari" title="wikilink">Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari</a></em>; this book, dealing with a <a href="cross-dressing" title="wikilink">gender disguised</a> warrior who conquers the Sultanate of Hindustan to save her husband, became one of Lie's best known works.</p>
<p>After van der Linden's death in 1885, Lie paid his teacher's widow a total of 1,000 gulden to acquire the Zending Pers. He changed the printer's name to Lie Kim Hok soon afterwards. He devoted most of his time to the publishing house and it grew quickly, printing works by other authors and reprinting some of Lie's earlier works; the publishing house was, however, unable to turn a profit. That year Lie published a new <em>syair</em>, consisting of 24 <a href="quartet" title="wikilink">quartets</a>, entitled <em>Orang Prampoewan</em>. He also wrote opinion pieces in various newspapers, including <em>Bintang Betawi</em> and <em>Domingoe</em>.</p>
<p>The following year Lie purchased publishing rights to the Malay-language newspaper <em><a href="Pembrita_Betawi" title="wikilink">Pembrita Betawi</a></em>, based in Batavia and edited by W. Meulenhoff, for 1000 gulden. The publishing house was moved to Batavia soon after and, beginning in mid-1886, Lie's publishing house was credited as printer. While busy with the press Lie wrote or contributed to four books: two pieces of nonfiction, one a collection of Chinese prophecies and the other detailing lease laws; a translation of the <em><a href="One_Thousand_and_One_Nights" title="wikilink">One Thousand and One Nights</a></em>, a collection already popular with Malay audiences; and a single novel, <em><a href="Tjhit_Liap_Seng" title="wikilink">Tjhit Liap Seng</a></em>. Following a group of educated persons in mainland China, <em>Tjhit Liap Seng</em> is credited as the first Malay Chinese novel.</p>
<p>Lie continued to publish novels set in China through 1887, writing five in this period. Several of these stories were based on extant Chinese tales, as retold by Lie's Chinese-speaking friends. Lie sold his shares in <em>Pembrita Betawi</em> to Karsseboom &amp; Co. the following year. He continued to print the newspaper until it &lt;U+2013&gt; and Lie's printing press &lt;U+2013&gt; were acquired by Albrecht &amp; Co. Lie would not work as a publisher again, although he continued to contribute writings to various newspapers, including Meulenhoff's new publication <em>Hindia Olanda</em>. He spent the next three years working a multitude of jobs, including bamboo salesman, contractor, and cashier.</p>
<h2 id="tiong-hoa-hwe-koan-translations-and-death">Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan, translations, and death</h2>
<p>In 1890 Lie began to work at a rice mill operated by his friend Tan Wie Siong; this would remain his main source of income for the remainder of his life. The following year he married Tan Sioe Nio, twenty years his younger. The new couple had a comfortable life: Lie received an adequate salary and the work did not consume much energy. To supplement his income Lie returned to translating, Dutch to Malay or vice-versa. Sometimes he would translate land deeds or other legal documents. Other times he translated works of literature. This included, in 1894, <em>De Graaf de Monte Cristo</em>, a translation of <a href="Alexandre_Dumas" title="wikilink">Alexandre Dumas</a>' <em><a href="The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo" title="wikilink">Le Comte de Monte-Cristo</a></em> in collaboration with the <a href="Indo_people" title="wikilink">Indo journalist</a> F. Wiggers. Lie and Wiggers included footnotes to describe aspects of European culture they deemed difficult to understand for non-European readers. Three years later Lie published a book on the teachings of <a href="Confucius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Confucius</a>. Entitled <em>Hikayat Kong Hoe Tjoe</em>, the book's contents were derived from European writings on <a href="Confucianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Confucianism</a> and his friends' explanations.</p>
<p><img src="Phoa_Keng_Hek.jpg" title="fig:Lie&#39;s former schoolmate Phoa Keng Hek, one of the Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan&#39;s founders." alt="Lie&#39;s former schoolmate Phoa Keng Hek, one of the Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan&#39;s founders." /> With nineteen other ethnic Chinese, including his former schoolmate <a href="Phoa_Keng_Hek" title="wikilink">Phoa Keng Hek</a>, Lie was an establishing member of the <a href="Tiong_Hoa_Hwe_Koan" title="wikilink">Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan</a> (THHK) school system and social organisation in 1900. Meant to promote ethnic Chinese rights at a time when they were <a href="Discrimination_against_Chinese_Indonesians" title="wikilink">treated as second-class citizens</a> and provide standardised formal education to ethnic Chinese students where the Dutch had not, the organisation was based on the teachings of Confucius and opened schools for both boys and girls. The THHK grew quickly and expanded into different fields; Lie would help organise a debating club, sports club, and charity fairs and concerts. Lie spent 1903 and 1904 as a managing member of the board, serving mainly as its treasurer.</p>
<p>Lie left the THHK in 1904, although he remained active in social work. Despite increasingly poor health Lie wrote opinion pieces for the dailies <em>Sin Po</em> and <em>Perniagaan</em>. He also translated extensively. In 1905 Lie published the first volume of his last Chinese-themed novel, <em>Pembalasan Dendam Hati</em>. This was followed in 1908 by <em>Kapitein Flamberge</em>, a translation of Paul Sauni&lt;U+00E8&gt;re's <em>Le Capitaine Belle-Humeur</em>. The following years saw him translate several books starring <a href="Pierre_Alexis_Ponson_du_Terrail" title="wikilink">Pierre Alexis Ponson du Terrail</a>'s character <a href="Rocambole_(character)" title="wikilink">Rocambole</a>, beginning with <em>Kawanan Pendjahat</em> in 1910. Two final translations, <em>Genevi&lt;U+00E8&gt;ve de Vadans</em> from a book entitled <em>De Juffrouw van Gezelschap</em> and <em>Prampoean jang Terdjoewal</em> from Hugo Hartmann's <em>Dolores, de Verkochte Vrouw</em>, were published in newspapers and collated as novels after Lie's death; the former translation was completed by the journalist Lauw Giok Lan.</p>
<p>On the night of 2 May 1912 Lie caught ill, and two days later his doctor diagnosed him with <a href="typhus" class="uri" title="wikilink">typhus</a>. Forbidden from leaving the house, Lie's condition steadily declined. He died on 6 May 1912 and was buried in <a href="Petamburan,_Tanah_Abang" title="wikilink">Kota Bambu, Batavia</a>, while THHK schools throughout the city flew their flags at <a href="half-mast" class="uri" title="wikilink">half-mast</a>. Lie was survived by his wife and four children: Soan Nio (born 1892), Hong Nio (born 1896), Kok Hian (born 1898), and Kok Hoei (born 1901). Tan Sioe Nio died the following year.</p>
<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
<p>During his early life Lie was known as a good student and, later, a good teacher. By the age of twenty he had a considerable command of Sundanese and Malay; he also spoke fair Dutch, a rarity for ethnic Chinese at the time. In his journalism career Lie attempted to avoid the <a href="yellow_press" title="wikilink">yellow press</a> tactics used by his contemporaries and preferred to avoid extensive <a href="polemic" title="wikilink">polemics</a> in the press. Malaysian journalism historian Ahmat Adam, writing in 1995, notes that Lie's entry into the press sparked an increase in Chinese presence in the <a href="Dutch_East_Indies" title="wikilink">Dutch East Indies</a>, and Soemardjo suggests that Lie remained best known to native Indonesians through his work in the press.</p>
<p>From a <a href="Linguistics" title="wikilink">linguist's</a> perspective, Kasijanto Sastrodinomo of the <a href="University_of_Indonesia" title="wikilink">University of Indonesia</a> describes <em>Malajoe Batawi</em> as &quot;extraordinary&quot;, noting that the first Malay-language textbook was written by a non-Malay. He also emphsises that the book did not use any English-derived linguistics terms which were omnipresent in 20th century Indonesian textbooks. Linguist Waruno Mahdi writes that Lie's dictionary was the &quot;most remarkable achievement of Chinese Malay writing&quot; from a linguist's point of view. In his doctoral dissertation, Benitez suggests that Lie may have hoped for bazaar Malay to become a <em><a href="lingua_franca" title="wikilink">lingua franca</a></em> in the Dutch East Indies. Adam found Lie's works to have left &quot;an indelible mark on the development of modern Indonesian language&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="Poster_siti_akbari.jpg" title="fig:One sheet for the Wong brothers&#39; Siti Akbari, said to be based on Lie&#39;s poem" alt="One sheet for the Wong brothers&#39; Siti Akbari, said to be based on Lie&#39;s poem" /> Adam suggests that Lie is best remembered for his contributions to <a href="Indonesian_literature" title="wikilink">Indonesian literature</a>. Lie's works of fiction were well received by his contemporaries. Tio writes that &quot;old and young intimately read his (Lie's) writings, which were praised for their simple language, rythym, clarity, freshness, and strength. The skill and accuracy with which he chose his words, the neatness and orderliness with which he arranged his sentences. ... People said that he was ahead of his time. He was likened to a large shining star, a stark contrast to the small, faded stars in the dark sky.&quot; Further praise was awarded by other contemporaries, both native and Chinese, such as Ibrahim gelar Marah Soetan and <a href="Agus_Salim" title="wikilink">Agus Salim</a>. When ethnic Chinese writers became common in the early 1900s, critics named Lie the &quot;father of Chinese Malay literature&quot; for his contributions, including <em>Siti Akbari</em> and <em>Tjhit Liap Seng</em>.</p>
<p>Several of Lie's books, including <em>Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari</em>, <em>Kitab Edja</em>, <em>Orang Prampoewan</em>, and <em>Sobat Anak-anak</em>, saw multiple printings. Tio does not record any after the 1920s. In 2000 <em>Kitab Edja</em> was reprinted in the inaugural volume of <em>Kesastraan Melayu Tionghoa dan Kebangsaan Indonesia</em>, an anthology of Chinese Malay literature. His <em>Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari</em>, which he considered one of his best works, was adapted for the stage several times. Lie used a simplified version to lead a troupe of teenaged actors, which saw some success in West Java. In 1922 the <a href="Sukabumi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sukabumi</a> branch of the Shiong Tih Hui published another stage adaptation under the title <em>Pembalesan Siti Akbari</em> (<em>Revenge of Siti Akbari</em>), which was being performed by <a href="Miss_Riboet&#39;s_Orion" title="wikilink">Miss Riboet's Orion</a> by 1926; this stageplay was reprinted by the <a href="Lontar_Foundation" title="wikilink">Lontar Foundation</a> in 2006 using the <a href="EYD" title="wikilink">Perfected Spelling System</a>. In 1940 the <a href="Wong_brothers" title="wikilink">Wong brothers</a> directed a film entitled <em><a href="Siti_Akbari" title="wikilink">Siti Akbari</a></em>, starring <a href="Roekiah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Roekiah</a> and <a href="Rd._Mochtar" title="wikilink">Rd. Mochtar</a>; the film was purportedly based on Lie's poem, although the extent of the influence is uncertain.</p>
<p>After the rise of the <a href="Indonesian_National_Awakening" title="wikilink">nationalist</a> movement and the Dutch colonial government's efforts to use <a href="Balai_Pustaka" title="wikilink">Balai Pustaka</a> to publish literary works for native consumption, Lie's work began to be marginalised. The Dutch colonial government used <a href="Malay_language" title="wikilink">Court Malay</a> as a language of administration, a language for everyday dealings which was taught in schools. The Indonesian nationalists appropriated the language to help build a national culture, promoted through the press and literature. Chinese Malay literature, written in &quot;low&quot; Malay, was declared steadily marginalised. Tio, writing in 1958, found that the younger generation were not learning about Lie and his works.</p>
<h2 id="controversy">Controversy</h2>
<p>In a 1923 article for the Chinese-owned newspaper <em>Lay Po</em>, Tio revealed that <em>Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari</em> had been heavily influenced by the 1847 poem <em><a href="Sjair_Abdoel_Moeloek" title="wikilink">Sjair Abdoel Moeloek</a></em>, credited variously to <a href="Raja_Ali_Haji" title="wikilink">Raja Ali Haji</a> or his sister Saleha. He noted that <em>Sair Siti Akbari</em>, which Lie stated to be his own, closely followed the earlier work's plot. In his 1958 biography of Lie, Tio revealed that Lie's <em>Tjhit Liap Seng</em> was an amalgamation of two European works: <a href="Jacob_van_Lennep" title="wikilink">Jacob van Lennep</a>'s <em>Klaasje Zevenster</em> (1865) and <a href="Jules_Verne" title="wikilink">Jules Verne</a>'s <em><a href="Tribulations_of_a_Chinaman_in_China" title="wikilink">Les Tribulations d'un Chinois en Chine</a></em> (<em>Tribulations of a Chinaman in China</em>; 1879). Tio noted a third work, <em>Pembalasan dendam Hati</em>, had extensive parallels with a work by Xavier de Mont&lt;U+00E9&gt;pin translated as <em>De Wraak van de Koddebeier</em> (<em>The Gamekeeper's Revenge</em>). In face of these revelations, literary critics such as Tan Soey Bing and Tan Oen Tjeng wrote that none of Lie's works were original.</p>
<p>This conclusion has been extensively challenged by writers who have shown original elements in Lie's work. Tio noted that in translating <em>Kapitein Flamberge</em> Lie had changed the ending; the main character no longer died in an explosion of <a href="dynamite" class="uri" title="wikilink">dynamite</a>, but survived to marry his love interest Hermine de Morlay. In exploring the similarities between <em>Sjair Abdoel Moeloek</em> and <em>Siti Akbari</em>, Zaini-Lajoubert noted that the main plot elements in both stories are the same, although some elements are present in one story and not the other &lt;U+2013&gt; or given more detail. She found that the two differed greatly in their styles, especially Lie's emphasis on description and realism. Salmon found that <em>Tjhit Liap Seng</em>{{'s}} general plot mostly followed that of <em>Klaasje Zevenster</em>, with some sections which seemed to be direct translations. However, she found that Lie also added, subtracted, and modified contents; she noted Lie's more sparse approach to description and the introduction of a new character, Thio Tian, who had lived in Java. The Indonesian literary critic Jakob Soemardjo summarised that Lie &quot;may be said to have been original in his style, but not in his material&quot;.</p>
