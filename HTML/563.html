<p><img src="Auto_Mechanic.jpg" title="fig:A mechanic working on the differential of a car" alt="A mechanic working on the differential of a car" />  An <strong>auto mechanic</strong> (or <strong>car mechanic</strong> in <a href="British_English" title="wikilink">British English</a> and <strong>motor mechanic</strong> in <a href="Australian_English" title="wikilink">Australian English</a>) is a <a href="mechanic" class="uri" title="wikilink">mechanic</a> who specializes in <a href="automobile" class="uri" title="wikilink">automobile</a> maintenance, repair, and sometimes modification. A mechanic may be knowledgeable in working on all parts of a variety of car makes or may specialize either in a specific area or in a specific make of car. In repairing cars, their main role is to diagnose the problem accurately and quickly. They often have to quote prices for their customers before commencing work or after partial disassembly for inspection. The mechanic uses both electronic means of gathering data as well as their senses. Their job may involve the repair of a specific part or the replacement of one or more parts as assemblies.</p>
<p>Basic vehicle maintenance is a fundamental part of a mechanic's work in some countries, while in others they are only consulted when a vehicle is already showing signs of malfunction. Preventative maintenance is also a fundamental part of a mechanic's job, but this is not possible in the case of vehicles that are not regularly maintained by a mechanic. One misunderstood aspect of preventative maintenance is <em>scheduled replacement</em> of various parts, which occurs before failure to avoid far more expensive damage. Because this means that parts are replaced before any problem is observed, many vehicle owners will not understand why the expense is necessary.</p>
<p>With the rapid advancement in technology, the mechanic's job has evolved from purely mechanical, to include electronic technology. Because vehicles today possess complex computer and electronic systems, mechanics need to have a broader base of knowledge than in the past. Lately, the term &quot;auto mechanic&quot; is being used less and less frequently and is being replaced by the euphemistic title &lt;U+201C&gt;automotive service technician&lt;U+201D&gt;. Fading quickly is the day of the 'shade tree mechanic', who needed little knowledge of today's computerized systems.</p>
<p>Due to the increasingly labyrinthine nature of the technology that is now incorporated into automobiles, most automobile dealerships now provide sophisticated diagnostic computers to each technician, without which they would be unable to diagnose or repair a vehicle.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<h3 id="australia">Australia</h3>
<p>In Australia, an apprentice works under one or more qualified mechanics for a period of four years. During that time, they attend a Technical and Further Education (TAFE) college one day per week for three years. In some states, mechanics are required to be trade qualified and hold a tradesman's certificate in order to work as a mechanic, and the workshop in which they work is required to have a workshop license. In other states, no such licensing is required.</p>
<h3 id="usa">USA</h3>
<p>In the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, several programs and schools that offer training for those interested in pursuing competencies as an automotive mechanic, or as an auto technician already exist (such as <a href="WyoTech" class="uri" title="wikilink">WyoTech</a> or <a href="Universal_Technical_Institute" title="wikilink">UTI</a>). A few of the aspects usually taught those studying for this career are: <a href="powertrain" class="uri" title="wikilink">powertrain</a> repair and diagnosis, emissions, and suspension. The National Automotive Technicians Education Foundation (NATEF) is responsible for evaluating technician training programs against standards developed by the automotive industry. NATEF certifies programs in four different categories: automotive, auto body, trucks (diesel technology) and alternative fuels.</p>
<p>Some mechanics are <a href="Automotive_Service_Excellence" title="wikilink">ASE</a> certified, which is a standardized method of testing skill level. While it's not required by law for a mechanic to be certified, some companies only hire or promote employees who have passed ASE tests. The technology used in automobiles changes very rapidly and the mechanic must be prepared to learn these new technologies and systems. The auto mechanic has a physically demanding job, often exposed to temperature extremes and well as lifting heavy objects and staying in uncomfortable positions for extended periods as well as exposure to gasoline, asbestos, and other toxic chemicals.</p>
<p>The Internet is even spreading to mechanics and you can now find certified mechanics providing advice online with sites such as <a href="http://www.2carpros.com/">2carpros</a> and <a href="http://www.driverside.com">Driverside's Ask a Mechanic</a>. This trend is consistent with the urbanization of the population. In larger cities it is less common to have a trusted neighborhood mechanic.</p>
<h2 id="related-careers">Related careers</h2>
<p>A mechanic may opt to engage in other careers related to his field. Teaching of automotive trade courses, for example, is almost entirely carried out by qualified mechanics in many countries.</p>
<p>There are several other trade qualifications for working on motor vehicles, including <em>panel beater</em>, <em>spray painter</em>, <em>body builder</em> and <em>motorcycle mechanic</em>. In some countries, these are separate trade courses, but a qualified tradesman from one can change to working as another. This usually requires that they work under another tradesman in much the same way as an apprentice.</p>
<p>Auto body repair involves less work with oily and greasy parts of vehicles, but involves exposure to particulate dust from sanding bodywork and potentially toxic chemical fumes from paint and related products. Salespeople and dealers often also need to acquire an in-depth knowledge of cars, and some mechanics are successful in these roles because of their knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="pit-crews">Pit crews</h3>
<p>Pit crews for motor racing are a specialized form of work undertaken by some mechanics. It is sometimes portrayed as glamorous in movies and television and is considered prestigious in some parts of the automotive industry. Working in a pit crew in professional racing circuits is dangerous and very stressful work but usually pays highly. This work is sometimes perceived as being difficult to come by because of the skill levels required.</p>
<h3 id="aircraft">Aircraft</h3>
<p>A mechanic who works on aircraft is called a <a href="Aircraft_Maintenance_Technician" title="wikilink">Aircraft Maintenance Technician</a>(or Aviation mechanic in the united states). The skill set and techniques are very similar, especially for those working with <a href="general_aviation" title="wikilink">general aviation</a> aircraft.</p>
