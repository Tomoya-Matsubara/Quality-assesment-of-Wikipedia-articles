<p>Stephen O'Connell was born in <a href="West_Palm_Beach,_Florida" title="wikilink">West Palm Beach, Florida</a> in 1916, and he attended public schools in West Palm Beach and <a href="Titusville,_Florida" title="wikilink">Titusville, Florida</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> After graduating from high school, he attended the University of Florida from 1934 to 1940, where he was a member, and later president, of <a href="Alpha_Tau_Omega" title="wikilink">Alpha Tau Omega</a> fraternity (Alpha Omega chapter).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> While he was a Florida student, he was elected president of the sophomore class, the student body and <a href="Florida_Blue_Key" title="wikilink">Florida Blue Key</a> leadership society.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He was also a star athlete, captained the varsity <a href="boxing" class="uri" title="wikilink">boxing</a> team, set the university record for fastest <a href="knock-out" class="uri" title="wikilink">knock-out</a>—twelve seconds including the count—and won the <a href="Southeastern_Conference" title="wikilink">Southeastern Conference</a> (SEC) middle-weight championship.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> O'Connell completed both his <a href="bachelor_of_science" title="wikilink">bachelor of science</a> degree from the <a href="Warrington_College_of_Business_Administration" title="wikilink">College of Business Administration</a> and his <a href="bachelor_of_laws" title="wikilink">bachelor of laws</a> degree from the <a href="University_of_Florida_College_of_Law" title="wikilink">College of Law</a> in 1940.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="war-law-and-politics">War, law and politics</h2>
<p>After briefly practicing law in <a href="Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida" title="wikilink">Fort Lauderdale, Florida</a>, O'Connell accepted an appointment as the civilian director of physical training for the U.S. <a href="Third_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Third Air Force</a> in <a href="Tampa,_Florida" title="wikilink">Tampa, Florida</a>, and thereafter entered active duty service with <a href="U.S._Army_Air_Corps" title="wikilink">U.S. Army Air Corps</a> when the United States entered <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> after the Japanese <a href="attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" title="wikilink">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> During the war, he served with the U.S. <a href="Fifth_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Fifth Air Force</a> in <a href="Brisbane,_Australia" title="wikilink">Brisbane, Australia</a> and as <a href="executive_officer" title="wikilink">executive officer</a> of the 312th Bombardment Group in the western Pacific, and completed his war-time service as a <a href="major" class="uri" title="wikilink">major</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>O'Connell married Rita McTigue after he returned from the war, and restarted his Fort Lauderdale law practice in 1946.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He also became an active member of the <a href="Broward_County" title="wikilink">Broward County</a> <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic Party</a>, and participated in the gubernatorial and senatorial campaign organizations of <a href="Dan_McCarty" title="wikilink">Dan McCarty</a>, <a href="George_Smathers" title="wikilink">George Smathers</a> and <a href="LeRoy_Collins" title="wikilink">LeRoy Collins</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In appreciation of his loyal work on behalf of the Democratic Party, Governor LeRoy Collins appointed O'Connell to the <a href="Florida_Supreme_Court" title="wikilink">Florida Supreme Court</a> in 1955.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> His time on the state supreme court followed the <a href="U.S._Supreme_Court" title="wikilink">U.S. Supreme Court</a>'s decision in <em><a href="Brown_v._Board_of_Education" title="wikilink">Brown v. Board of Education</a></em>, and O'Connell's judicial philosophy was characterized by conservatism and gradualist <a href="racial_integration" title="wikilink">integration</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> His fellow justices elected him chief justice of the court in 1967, in which position he would serve only briefly.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> O'Connell served as a justice until the <a href="Florida_Board_of_Regents" title="wikilink">Florida Board of Regents</a> selected him to be the president of the University of Florida later in 1967.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="university-president">University president</h2>
<p>O'Connell was the sixth president of the University of Florida, and the first <a href="alumnus" class="uri" title="wikilink">alumnus</a> of the university to be appointed as its president.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> When O'Connell assumed the presidency of the university in 1967, the student protest movement was peaking nation-wide, and numerous demonstrations, both peaceful and militant, were held on the Florida campus during his six-year term.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Faculty-administration relations were also strained, because many professors were sympathetic to the student protesters and their various social and political goals.</p>

<p>O'Connell's administration canceled classes on May 6, 1970, the day after the <a href="Kent_State_shootings" title="wikilink">Kent State shootings</a>, and declared a day of morning.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> It was the first time classes had been canceled at the University of Florida.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The University of Florida had integrated racially in 1958 without violence and with little protest.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> By the 1967 fall term, however, only sixty-one black students were enrolled, and many black students were actually foreign exchange students.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The Black Student Union organized a sit-in protest inside the university president's office suite on April 15, 1971; the students were demanding a black cultural center. The occupation ended with the peaceful arrest of sixty-six students, after O'Connell had threatened them with expulsion.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In the aftermath of the sit-in, O'Connell refused to grant complete amnesty to the student demonstrators who had participated, and 123 of the university's black students and several black faculty members left the university in protest.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>On balance, O'Connell's administration did much to further integrate <a href="African-American" title="wikilink">African-Americans</a> into the mainstream of the University of Florida's academic life. When he assumed the presidency in 1967, there were sixty-one black students and no black professors; when O'Connell retired in 1973, 642 black students were enrolled, a ten-fold increase, and the faculty included nineteen black professors.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>O'Connell's critics accused him of racial and political animus in his sometimes hard-line decisions, but his administration kept the university open, and classes, exams and commencements were held without serious interruption in the aftermath of the Kent State shootings, when many American universities were forced to close and send their students home.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> During the August 1973 commencement proceedings, the assembled graduating students twice rose to their feet spontaneously to pay tribute to the man who guided the university through its most difficult era.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>O'Connell's greatest long-term impact may have been the reorganization of the University of Florida Alumni Association and the creation of an Office of Development staffed by professional fundraisers.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The reorganization of the alumni association and advancement program led to the rapid growth of the university's <a href="financial_endowment" title="wikilink">endowment</a> over the years following his presidency.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> O'Connell began a reversal of policy and attitudes among many state legislators and academics who had previously opposed large-scale private fund-raising and endowment of the Florida's public universities.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>O'Connell announced his resignation on June 28, 1973.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He did not provide a specific reason, but it was known that his wife was ill with diabetes.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> After retiring as university president, he returned to his home in <a href="Tallahassee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tallahassee</a>, restarted his law practice, remained active in university affairs, and engaged in cattle ranching.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> O'Connell later became the chairman and <a href="chief_executive_officer" title="wikilink">chief executive officer</a> of Lewis State Bank, then the oldest bank in Florida, and held that position until 1983.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Thereafter, he returned to the active practice of law in Tallahassee in partnership with a Tampa-based firm.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
