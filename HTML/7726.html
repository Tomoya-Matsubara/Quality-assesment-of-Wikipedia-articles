<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="construction">Construction</h3>
<p>John F. Kennedy International Airport was originally <strong>Idlewild Airport</strong>  after the Idlewild Golf Course that it displaced. It was built to relieve <a href="LaGuardia_Airport" title="wikilink">LaGuardia Airport</a> which was crowded soon after opening in 1939. Construction began in 1943 by local firms such as the Edenwald Group headed by the late Charles Follini Sr. About $60 million was initially spent, but only  of land on the site of the Idlewild golf course were earmarked for use.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The project was renamed <strong>Major General Alexander E. Anderson Airport</strong> in 1943 after a Queens resident who had commanded a Federalized National Guard unit in the southern United States and who had died in late 1942. In March 1948 the <a href="New_York_City_Council" title="wikilink">New York City Council</a> changed it to <strong>New York International Airport, Anderson Field</strong>, but the common name was &quot;Idlewild&quot; until 1963.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The Port Authority leased the airport property from the City of New York in 1947 and maintains this lease as of the late 2000s.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The first commercial flight at the airport was on July 1, 1948; the opening ceremony was attended by President <a href="Harry_Truman" title="wikilink">Harry Truman</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The Port Authority cancelled foreign airlines' permits to use LaGuardia, effectively forcing them to move to the new airport during the next couple of years.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The airport opened with six runways and a seventh under construction;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> runways 1L and 7L were held in reserve and never came into use as runways. Runway 31R (originally ) is still in use; runway 31L (originally ) opened soon after the rest of the airport and is still in use; runway 1R closed in 1957 and runway 7R closed around 1966. Runway 4 (originally 8,000 ft, now runway 4L) opened June 1949 and runway 4R was added ten years later. A smaller runway 14/32 was constructed after runway 7R closed and was used through 1990.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> This short runway was used by <a href="general_aviation" title="wikilink">general aviation</a>, <a href="STOL" class="uri" title="wikilink">STOL</a>, and smaller commuter flights.</p>

<p>The airport was renamed <strong>John F. Kennedy International Airport</strong> on December 24, 1963, one month after the <a href="assassination_of_President_John_F._Kennedy" title="wikilink">assassination of President John F. Kennedy</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>The Port of New York Authority originally planned a single 55-gate terminal, but the major airlines did not agree with this plan, arguing that the terminal would be far too small for future traffic.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Architect <a href="Wallace_Harrison" title="wikilink">Wallace Harrison</a> then designed a master plan under which each major airline at the airport would be given its own space to develop its own terminal design.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> This scheme made construction more practical, made terminals more navigable and introduced incentives for airlines to compete with each other for the best design.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The revised plan met airline approval in 1955, with seven terminals initially planned&lt;U+2014&gt;five for individual airlines, one developed for 3 airlines, and an international arrivals building. (National Airlines and British Airways arrived later.)<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The International Arrivals Building, or IAB, was the first new terminal project at the airport, designed by <a href="Skidmore,_Owings_and_Merrill" title="wikilink">Skidmore, Owings and Merrill</a> and opening in December 1957. Stretching nearly  parallel to runway 7R where Terminal 4 is now, it was designed by <a href="Skidmore,_Owings_&amp;_Merrill" title="wikilink">Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</a> and had &quot;finger&quot; piers at right-angles to the main building. These allowed a greater number of aircraft to park, a major innovation at the time.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></li>
<li><a href="United_Airlines" title="wikilink">United Airlines</a> opened Terminal 7 (later renumbered Terminal 9), a Skidmore design similar to that of the IAB, in October 1959. <a href="Eastern_Airlines" title="wikilink">Eastern Airlines</a> opened its <a href="Chester_L._Churchill" title="wikilink">Chester L.

<li><a href="American_Airlines" title="wikilink">American Airlines</a> opened Terminal 8 in 1960. The terminal was designed by <a href="Kahn_and_Jacobs" title="wikilink">Kahn and Jacobs</a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and had a  <a href="stained_glass" title="wikilink">stained glass</a> facade designed by <a href="Robert_Sowers" title="wikilink">Robert Sowers</a>, the largest stained glass installation in the world until 1979. The facade was removed in 2007 as the terminal was demolished to make room for the new Terminal 8; American cited the prohibitive cost of removing the enormous installation.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></li>
<li><a href="Pan_American_World_Airways" title="wikilink">Pan American World Airways</a> opened the <a href="Worldport_(Pan_Am)" title="wikilink">Worldport</a> (later Terminal 3) in 1960. It featured a large, elliptical roof suspended by 32 sets of radial posts and cables; the roof extended  beyond the base of the terminal to cover the passenger loading area. It was one of the first airline terminals in the world to feature <a href="Jetway" title="wikilink">Jetways</a> that connected to the terminal and that could be moved to provide an easy walkway for passengers from the terminal to a docked aircraft, rather than having to board the plane outside via <a href="airstairs" class="uri" title="wikilink">airstairs</a>, which descend from an aircraft, via truck-mounted mobile stairs, or via wheeled stairs.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></li>
<li><a href="Trans_World_Airlines" title="wikilink">Trans World Airlines</a> opened the <a href="TWA_Flight_Center" title="wikilink">TWA Flight Center</a> in 1962, designed by <a href="Eero_Saarinen" title="wikilink">Eero Saarinen</a> with a distinctive winged-bird shape. With the demise of TWA in 2001, the terminal remained vacant until 2005 when <a href="JetBlue_Airways" title="wikilink">JetBlue Airways</a> and the <a href="Port_Authority_of_New_York_and_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ)</a> financed the construction of a new 26-gate terminal partly encircling the Saarinen building. Called now Terminal 5 (or simply T5), the new terminal opened October 22, 2008. T5 is connected to the Saarinen central building through the original passenger departure-arrival tubes which connected the building to the outlying gates; the Port Authority is working on restorations to the remaining original Saarinen terminal, also known as the head house.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></li>
<li><a href="Northwest_Airlines" title="wikilink">Northwest Airlines</a>, <a href="Braniff_International" title="wikilink">Braniff International</a> and <a href="Northeast_Airlines" title="wikilink">Northeast Airlines</a> opened a joint terminal in 1962 (now Terminal 2).<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></li>
<li><a href="National_Airlines_(NA)" title="wikilink">National Airlines</a> opened the <a href="Sundrome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sundrome</a> (now Terminal 6) in 1970. The terminal was designed by <a href="Pei_Cobb_Freed_&amp;_Partners" title="wikilink">I.M.Pei</a>. It was unique for its use of all-glass <a href="mullion" title="wikilink">mullions</a> dividing the window sections, unprecedented at the time.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In 2001, <a href="United_Airlines" title="wikilink">United Airlines</a> planned to redevelop this terminal and the TWA Flight Center as a new United terminal,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Terminal 6 was used by <a href="JetBlue_Airways" title="wikilink">JetBlue Airways</a> from 2001 through 2008 and vacated and demolished when JetBlue moved to Terminal 5.</li>

<p>JFK was designed for aircraft up to  gross weight<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> and had to be modified in the late 1960s to accommodate <a href="Boeing_747" title="wikilink">Boeing 747s</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>Airlines began scheduling jets into Idlewild in 1958&lt;U+2013&gt;59; LaGuardia didn't get jet airliners until 1964, so Idlewild soon became New York's busiest airline airport. In 1962&lt;U+2013&gt;67 it had more airline takeoffs and landings than LGA and EWR combined and was the second-busiest airline airport in the country, peaking at 403,981 airline operations in 1967. During 1960&lt;U+2013&gt;66 LaGuardia got a new terminal and longer runways, and by the middle 1970s the two airports had roughly equal passenger airline traffic (by flight count, not passenger count). (Until the 1980s Newark was always third place, except during LGA's reconstruction.) The supersonic <a href="Concorde" class="uri" title="wikilink">Concorde</a>, operated by <a href="Air_France" title="wikilink">Air France</a> and <a href="British_Airways" title="wikilink">British Airways</a>, provided scheduled <a href="Transatlantic_flight" title="wikilink">trans-Atlantic</a> <a href="supersonic" class="uri" title="wikilink">supersonic</a> service to JFK from November 22, 1977 until October 24, 2003, when Concorde was retired by both carriers.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>JFK went through a $10.3 billion redevelopment. Construction of the <a href="AirTrain_JFK" title="wikilink">AirTrain JFK</a> rapid transit system began in 1998; completed in December 2003, the rail network links each airport terminal to New York City subways and regional commuter trains at <a href="Howard_Beach,_New_York" title="wikilink">Howard Beach</a> and <a href="Jamaica,_New_York" title="wikilink">Jamaica, Queens</a>. The airport opened a new Terminal 1 on May 28, 1998, and the $1.4 billion replacement for the International Arrivals Building, Terminal 4, opened on May 24, 2001.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Construction has been completed on <a href="JetBlue_Airways" title="wikilink">JetBlue Airways</a>'s new Terminal 5, which incorporates the historic landmark TWA Flight Center terminal, while Terminals 8 and 9 were recently demolished and rebuilt as a unified Terminal 8 for the <a href="American_Airlines" title="wikilink">American Airlines</a> hub. In 2008 the Port Authority Board of Commissioners approved a $20 million planning study for the much needed redevelopment of Terminals 2 and 3, the hub of <a href="Delta_Air_Lines" title="wikilink">Delta Air Lines</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>On March 19, 2007 JFK became the first airport in the United States to receive the <a href="Airbus_A380" title="wikilink">Airbus A380</a> with passengers aboard. The route, with capacity for more than 500 passengers was operated by Lufthansa and Airbus and arrived at Terminal 1. On August 1, 2008 JFK received the first regularly scheduled commercial A380 flight to the United States, on <a href="Emirates_Airline" title="wikilink">Emirates</a>' New York &lt;U+2013&gt; Dubai route using Terminal 4.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> This service was suspended in 2009, due to poor demand;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> </p>
<h2 id="previous-terminals">Previous terminals</h2>
<h3 id="eastern-air-lines-terminal">Eastern Air Lines terminal</h3>
<p>This terminal, which sat on the site of today's Terminal 1, opened in 1959 and was demolished a few years after the collapse of <a href="Eastern_Air_Lines" title="wikilink">Eastern Air Lines</a> in 1991.</p>
<h3 id="terminal-3-worldport">Terminal 3 (Worldport)</h3>

<p>Terminal 3 was built as the <a href="Worldport_(Pan_Am)" title="wikilink">Worldport</a> in 1960 for Pan American; it expanded after the introduction of the 747 in 1970. After Pan Am's demise in 1991 Delta Air Lines took over ownership of the terminal and was its only occupant until its closure in 2013, and had a connector to Terminal 2, Delta's other terminal. Terminal 3 had 16 Jetway equipped gates: 1&lt;U+2013&gt;10, 12, 14&lt;U+2013&gt;18 with two hardstand gates (Gate 11) and a helipad on Taxiway 'KK'.</p>
<p>A $1.2 billion project was completed in 2013, which Terminal 4 was expanded with Delta is moving its T3 operations to T4. T3 will be entirely demolished in 2015 (including the 'flying saucer' roof) to provide additional aircraft parking stands to speed up ground handling.</p>
<p>On May 23, 2013 the final departure from the terminal, <a href="Delta_Air_Lines" title="wikilink">Delta Air Lines</a> Flight 286, a <a href="Boeing_747-400" title="wikilink">Boeing 747-400</a> to <a href="Tel_Aviv" title="wikilink">Tel Aviv</a> <a href="Ben_Gurion_Airport" title="wikilink">Ben Gurion Airport</a>, departed from Gate 6 at 11:25pm local time.

<p>The original Terminal 8 opened in 1960; its stained-glass facade was the largest in existence at the time. It was always used by <a href="American_Airlines" title="wikilink">American Airlines</a>, and in later years it was used by other <a href="oneworld" class="uri" title="wikilink">oneworld</a> airlines that did not use Terminal 7. Terminal 9 opened in 1959 and was used by <a href="United_Airlines" title="wikilink">United Airlines</a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> until it vacated the terminal in 1991 and became a tenant at British Airways' Terminal 7. Terminal 9 then became the home of American Airlines' domestic operations and <a href="American_Eagle_Airlines" title="wikilink">American Eagle</a> flights for the remainder of its life. The terminals were demolished in the early-to-mid-2000s and replaced with a new Terminal 8.</p>
<h3 id="tower-air-terminal">Tower Air terminal</h3>
<p>The <a href="Tower_Air" title="wikilink">Tower Air</a> terminal, unlike other terminals at JFK airport, sat outside the Central Terminals area in Building 213 in Cargo Area A. Originally used by <a href="Pan_American_World_Airways" title="wikilink">Pan Am</a> until the expansion of the Worldport (later Terminal 3), it was later used by Tower Air and twa shuttle until the airline's collapse in 2000.

<p><img src="JFK_terminal_map.jpg" title="fig:A map of JFK&#39;s terminals" alt="A map of JFK&#39;s terminals" /> JFK has six terminals (ten until the late 1990s, then nine until the early 2000s, followed by eight until 2011 and seven until May 2013) containing 151 gates, numbered 1&lt;U+2013&gt;8, but skipping Terminal 6, the former <a href="Sundrome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sundrome</a>, which was demolished in 2011 after Terminal 5 was expanded (the number will remain disused and skipped). Terminal 3, which is closed but still standing at this time, will also be a disused and skipped number when demolished.</p>
<p>The terminal buildings, with the exception of the former <a href="Tower_Air" title="wikilink">Tower Air</a> terminal, are arranged in a deformed U-shaped wavy pattern around a central area containing parking, a power plant, and other airport facilities. The terminals are connected by the <a href="AirTrain_JFK" title="wikilink">AirTrain</a> system and access roads. Wayfinding signage throughout the terminals was designed by <a href="Paul_Mijksenaar" title="wikilink">Paul Mijksenaar</a>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> A 2006 survey by <a href="J.D._Power_and_Associates" title="wikilink">J.D.

<p>Until the early 1990s, the terminals were known by the primary airlines that served it, except for Terminal 4, which was known as the International Arrivals Building. In the early 1990s, all of the terminals were given numbers except for the Tower Air terminal, which sat outside the Central Terminals area and was not numbered. Like in the other airports controlled by the Port Authority, terminals are sometimes managed and operated by independent terminal operators. At JFK, all terminals are currently operated by airlines or consortiums of the airlines serving them, with the exception of the <a href="Schiphol_Group" title="wikilink">Schiphol Group</a>-operated Terminal 4. All terminals except Terminal 2 can handle international arrivals.</p>

<p>Terminal 1 was opened in 1998, 50 years after the opening of JFK, at the direction of the Terminal One Group, a consortium of four key operating carriers: <a href="Air_France" title="wikilink">Air France</a>, <a href="Japan_Airlines" title="wikilink">Japan Airlines</a>, <a href="Korean_Air" title="wikilink">Korean Air</a> and <a href="Lufthansa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lufthansa</a>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> This partnership was founded after the four airlines reached agreement that existing international carrier facilities were inadequate for their needs.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> It was designed by William Nicholas Bodouva + Associates.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Terminal 1, along with <a href="#Terminal_4" title="wikilink">Terminal 4</a>, has the capability to handle the superjumbo <a href="Airbus_A380" title="wikilink">Airbus A380</a> aircraft, which are flown by Air France on the route from <a href="Paris-Charles_de_Gaulle_Airport" title="wikilink">Paris Charles De Gaulle</a>, Lufthansa on the route from <a href="Frankfurt_Airport" title="wikilink">Frankfurt Airport</a> and Korean Air on the route from <a href="Incheon_Airport" title="wikilink">Incheon Airport</a>. Air France operated <a href="Concorde" class="uri" title="wikilink">Concorde</a> here until 2003. Terminal 1 has 11 gates.</p>
<h3 id="terminal-2">Terminal 2</h3>
<p>Terminal 2 opened in 1962 as the home of <a href="Northeast_Airlines" title="wikilink">Northeast Airlines</a>, <a href="Braniff" class="uri" title="wikilink">Braniff</a> and <a href="Northwest_Airlines" title="wikilink">Northwest Airlines</a>, and is now used by <a href="Delta_Air_Lines" title="wikilink">Delta Air Lines</a>. After the demise of Northeast Airlines and Braniff, the building was taken over by Pan American World Airways, and subsequently by Delta. Since the opening of the Terminal 4 addition in May 2013, Terminal 2 has been designated as the &quot;C&quot; gates by Delta, and has 8 Jetway-equipped gates (C60-C63, C67-C70) and 17 stands for <a href="Delta_Connection" title="wikilink">Delta Connection</a> carriers (C64A&lt;U+2013&gt;H, C64J, C66K&lt;U+2013&gt;N, C66P&lt;U+2013&gt;S). It is also currently moving its international operations into a new expansion of Terminal 4 and demolishing Terminal 3. The project was approved by the Port Authority on August 5, 2010.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> T2 will be closed once Phase Two of the T4 expansion is completed by 2015.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="JFKNewYorkTerm4_1.jpg" title="fig:Terminal 4 replaced the former International Arrivals Building in May 2001" alt="Terminal 4 replaced the former International Arrivals Building in May 2001" /> Terminal 4, the international terminal, is able to handle the <a href="Airbus_A380" title="wikilink">Airbus A380</a> and was developed by LCOR, Inc and is managed by the <a href="Schiphol_Group" title="wikilink">Schiphol Group</a>. This terminal serves as a major international hub for <a href="Delta_Air_Lines" title="wikilink">Delta Air Lines</a> and was the first one in the United States to be managed by a foreign airport operator. Terminal 4 is the major gateway for international arrivals at JFK. Opened in 2001 and designed by <a href="Skidmore,_Owings_and_Merrill" title="wikilink">Skidmore, Owings and Merrill</a>,<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> the new  building was built at a cost of $1.4 billion and replaced JFK's old International Arrivals Building, or simply IAB, which opened in 1957.</p>
<p>Terminal 4 has 26 gates in two concourses: A2&lt;U+2013&gt;A7, B20, B22&lt;U+2013&gt;B41. As of 2013, Delta and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey agreed<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> to an additional $175 million phase II expansion, which will allow Delta to construct 11 regional jet gates at Terminal 4, as well. The agreement allows Delta to eliminate a proposed physical connection it has previously planned to build with its existing Terminal 2 and instead close T2. The work on the Delta hub has commenced, with funding primarily from $900 million in special-project <a href="Bond_(finance)" title="wikilink">bonds</a>.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Delta will <a href="http://www.panynj.gov/corporate-information/pdf/board_minutes_feb_6_2013-final.pdf">seek funding</a> for the regional jet expansion from the <a href="http://www.nycedc.com/nycida">New York City Industrial Development Agency.</a></p>
<p><a href="Concourse" class="uri" title="wikilink">Concourse</a> A has six gates, numbered A2&lt;U+2013&gt;A7. Concourse B has twenty gates, numbered B20&lt;U+2013&gt;B41, with the exclusion of B21. As Terminal 4 was built during the construction of the AirTrain, the AirTrain station was built inside the terminal building. Other AirTrain stations are built across from terminal buildings. Delta Air Lines has also moved much of its operations to T4, as it expands operations beyond T2, with T3 now closed.</p>
<p>The terminal was recently expanded on May 24, 2013, which includes nine new international gates, additional baggage space, customs and border-security facilities,<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> and serves many international airlines daily, including <a href="Swiss_International" title="wikilink">Swiss International</a>, <a href="Asiana_Airlines" title="wikilink">Asiana Airlines</a>, <a href="Singapore_Airlines" title="wikilink">Singapore Airlines</a>, <a href="EgyptAir" class="uri" title="wikilink">EgyptAir</a>, <a href="Emirates_(airline)" title="wikilink">Emirates</a>, <a href="Pakistan_International" title="wikilink">Pakistan International</a>, <a href="Kuwait_Airways" title="wikilink">Kuwait Airways</a> and <a href="Etihad_Airways" title="wikilink">Etihad Airways</a>.</p>

The Saarinen building is currently closed for refurbishment; it is unclear when the building will reopen or what purpose it will have. Saarinen also designed the terminal at <a href="Washington_Dulles_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Washington Dulles International Airport</a>. The active T5 building has 26 gates: 1&lt;U+2013&gt;12, 14&lt;U+2013&gt;27. There is no gate 13 at T5. The terminal is also used by <a href="Hawaiian_Airlines" title="wikilink">Hawaiian Airlines</a>, which announced a partnership agreement with JetBlue and began service in Terminal 5 in June 2012.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> <a href="Aer_Lingus" title="wikilink">Aer Lingus</a> moved to the terminal from Terminal 4 on April 3, 2013.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> On May 31, 2012, JetBlue announced that the Port Authority had approved an expansion to T5 in order to accommodate international arrivals, where as now non-cleared international JetBlue flights arrive at Terminal 4.

<p>Terminal 7 was designed by <a href="GMW_Architects" title="wikilink">GMW Architects</a><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> and built for <a href="British_Overseas_Airways_Corporation" title="wikilink">BOAC</a> and <a href="Air_Canada" title="wikilink">Air Canada</a> in 1970. It is currently operated by <a href="British_Airways" title="wikilink">British Airways</a>. This terminal is the only terminal owned and operated by a foreign carrier on US soil. A variety of <a href="Oneworld" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oneworld</a> alliance carriers operate out of Terminal 7 at this time, including British Airways, <a href="Cathay_Pacific" title="wikilink">Cathay Pacific</a>, <a href="Iberia_(airline)" title="wikilink">Iberia</a> (which is owned by the same parent company as British Airways), and <a href="Qantas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qantas</a>. <a href="Star_Alliance" title="wikilink">Star Alliance</a> carriers <a href="United_Airlines" title="wikilink">United Airlines</a>, <a href="US_Airways" title="wikilink">US Airways</a> and <a href="All_Nippon_Airways" title="wikilink">ANA</a> also use the terminal.

British Airways is currently evaluating the future of Terminal 7, as its lease with the Port Authority ends in 2015. Management has indicated a desire to relocate British Airways/Iberia's operations to a new pier located east and connected to Terminal 8, pending approval of an alliance with American Airlines.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>

The new terminal was built in four phases, which involved the construction of a new midfield concourse, demolition of the old Terminal 9, and finally demolition of the old Terminal 8. It opened in stages between 2005 and had its &quot;official&quot; opening in August 2007.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> It is a major <a href="Oneworld" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oneworld</a> hub, and American Airlines is the major Oneworld carrier at Terminal 8. American operates Terminal 8, is the largest carrier in the terminal, and is the third largest carrier at JFK. In addition to operations at Terminal 7, some Oneworld airlines including <a href="Finnair" class="uri" title="wikilink">Finnair</a>, <a href="Royal_Jordanian_Airlines" title="wikilink">Royal Jordanian Airlines</a>, <a href="airberlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">airberlin</a> and <a href="LAN_Airlines" title="wikilink">LAN Airlines</a> (and its affiliates)<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> operate out of Terminal 8. Future member <a href="Qatar_Airways" title="wikilink">Qatar Airways</a> also operates its flights out of Terminal 8.</p>
<p>The terminal is twice the size of <a href="Madison_Square_Garden" title="wikilink">Madison Square Garden</a>. It offers dozens of retail and food outlets, 84 ticket counters, 44 self-service kiosks, 10 security checkpoint lanes and a U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility that can process more than 1,600 people an hour. Terminal 8 has an annual capacity of 12.8M passengers.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> It has two American Airlines <a href="Admirals_Club" title="wikilink">Admirals Clubs</a> and a Flagship Lounge for premium class passengers.</p>

Gate 32 is subdivided into 4 regional service gates for small jets, 32F&lt;U+2013&gt;32I. The total number of jetbridges is, therefore, 36. Passenger access to Concourse C is by an underground tunnel which includes moving walkways. Of interest are a history of American Airlines logos on display between the security checkpoint and the concourses.</p>

Because it lies almost entirely within Kennedy Airport, the JFK Expressway was constructed, and is maintained by the Port Authority. The expressway was built as part of an ongoing, multi-billion overhaul of Kennedy Airport that began in the late 1980s. It was designed to relieve up to 30 percent of the traffic volume from the Van Wyck Expressway.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> Approximately 6 major rental car companies serve JFK Airport, with rental locations located on and off the airport.
