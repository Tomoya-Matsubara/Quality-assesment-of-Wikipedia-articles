<p><strong><em>Doe v. Bolton</em></strong>, 410 U.S. 179 (1973), was a <a href="landmark_case" title="wikilink">landmark</a> decision of the <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">United States Supreme Court</a> overturning the <a href="abortion" class="uri" title="wikilink">abortion</a> law of <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>. The Supreme Court's decision was released on January 22, 1973, the same day as the decision in the better-known case of <em><a href="Roe_v._Wade" title="wikilink">Roe v. Wade</a></em>, 410 U.S. 113 (1973).</p>

<p>The Georgia law in question permitted abortion only in cases of rape, severe fetal deformity, or the possibility of severe or fatal injury to the mother. Other restrictions included the requirement that the procedure be approved in writing by three physicians and by a special committee of the staff of the hospital where the abortion was to be performed. In addition, only Georgia residents could receive abortions under this statutory scheme: non-residents could not have an abortion in Georgia under any circumstances.</p>
<p>The plaintiff, a pregnant woman who was given the pseudonym &quot;Mary Doe&quot; in court papers to protect her identity, sued Arthur K. Bolton, then the Attorney General of Georgia, as the official responsible for enforcing the law. The anonymous plaintiff has since been identified as <a href="Sandra_Cano" title="wikilink">Sandra Cano</a>, a 22-year-old mother of three who was nine weeks pregnant at the time the lawsuit was filed. Cano describes herself as pro-life and claims her attorney, <a href="Margie_Pitts_Hames" title="wikilink">Margie Pitts Hames</a>, lied to her in order to have a plaintiff. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>A three-judge panel of the <a href="United_States_district_court" title="wikilink">United States district court</a> declared the conditional restrictions portion of the law unconstitutional, but upheld the medical approval and residency requirements, and refused to issue an injunction against enforcement of the law. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court under a statute, since repealed, permitting bypass of the circuit appeals court.</p>
<p>The oral arguments and re-arguments followed the same schedule as those in <em>Roe</em>. Atlanta attorney Hames represented Doe at the hearings, while Georgia assistant attorney general Dorothy Toth Beasley represented Bolton.</p>
<p>The same 7-2 majority (Justices <a href="Byron_White" title="wikilink">White</a> and <a href="William_Rehnquist" title="wikilink">Rehnquist</a> dissenting) that struck down a <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a> abortion law in <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, invalidated most of the remaining restrictions of the Georgia abortion law, including the medical approval and residency requirements. Together, <em>Doe</em> and <em>Roe</em> declared abortion as a <a href="United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">constitutional right</a> and by implication overturned most laws against abortion in other <a href="US_state" title="wikilink">US states</a>.</p>
<h3 id="broad-definition-of-health">Broad definition of health</h3>
<p>The Court's opinion in <em>Doe v. Bolton</em> stated that a woman may obtain an abortion after <a href="Fetus#Viability" title="wikilink">viability</a>, if necessary to protect her health. The Court defined health as follows:</p>

When the appeals court also denied her motion,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> she requested review by the United States Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court declined to hear Sandra Cano's suit to overturn the ruling.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
