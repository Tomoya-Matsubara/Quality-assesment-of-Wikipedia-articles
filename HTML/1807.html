It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with <em><a href="Hamlet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hamlet</a></em>, is one of his most frequently performed plays. Today, the title characters are regarded as <a href="archetype" title="wikilink">archetypal</a> young lovers.</p>
<p><em>Romeo and Juliet</em> belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity. Its plot is based on an Italian tale, translated into verse as <em><a href="The_Tragical_History_of_Romeus_and_Juliet" title="wikilink">The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet</a></em> by <a href="Arthur_Brooke_(poet)" title="wikilink">Arthur Brooke</a> in 1562, and retold in prose in <em><a href="Palace_of_Pleasure" title="wikilink">Palace of Pleasure</a></em> by <a href="William_Painter" title="wikilink">William Painter</a> in 1582. Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both, but developed supporting characters, particularly <a href="Mercutio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mercutio</a> and <a href="Count_Paris" title="wikilink">Paris</a>, in order to expand the plot. Believed to be written between 1591 and 1595, the play was first published in a <a href="First_Quarto" title="wikilink">quarto</a> version in 1597. This text was of poor quality, and later editions corrected it, bringing it more in line with Shakespeare's original text.</p>
<p>Shakespeare's use of <a href="dramatic_structure" title="wikilink">dramatic structure</a>, especially effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension, his expansion of minor characters, and his use of sub-plots to embellish the story, has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill. The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters, sometimes changing the form as the character develops. Romeo, for example, grows more adept at the <a href="sonnet" class="uri" title="wikilink">sonnet</a> over the course of the play.</p>
<p><em>Romeo and Juliet</em> has been adapted numerous times for stage, film, musical and opera. During the <a href="English_Restoration" title="wikilink">Restoration</a>, it was revived and heavily revised by <a href="William_Davenant" title="wikilink">William Davenant</a>. <a href="David_Garrick" title="wikilink">David Garrick's</a> 18th-century version also modified several scenes, removing material then considered indecent, and <a href="Georg_Benda" title="wikilink">Georg Benda's</a> operatic adaptation omitted much of the action and added a happy ending. Performances in the 19th century, including <a href="Charlotte_Cushman" title="wikilink">Charlotte Cushman's</a>, restored the original text, and focused on greater realism. <a href="John_Gielgud" title="wikilink">John Gielgud's</a> 1935 version kept very close to Shakespeare's text, and used Elizabethan costumes and staging to enhance the drama. In the 20th century the play has been adapted in versions as diverse as MGM's comparatively faithful <a href="Romeo_and_Juliet_(1936_film)" title="wikilink">1936 film</a>, the 1950s stage musical <em><a href="West_Side_Story" title="wikilink">West Side Story</a></em>, and 1996's MTV-inspired <em><a href="Romeo_+_Juliet" title="wikilink">Romeo + Juliet</a></em>.</p>

Oil on canvas, 1823." alt="L&lt;U+2019&gt;ultimo bacio dato a Giulietta da Romeo by Francesco Hayez. Oil on canvas, 1823." /> The play begins with a street brawl between <a href="Characters_in_Romeo_and_Juliet#Montagues" title="wikilink">Montagues</a> and <a href="Characters_in_Romeo_and_Juliet#Capulets" title="wikilink">Capulets</a>. The <a href="Prince_Escalus" title="wikilink">Prince of Verona</a> intervenes and declares that further breach of the peace will be punishable by death. Later, <a href="Count_Paris" title="wikilink">Count Paris</a> talks to <a href="Lord_Capulet" title="wikilink">Lord Capulet</a> about marrying his daughter, but Capulet is wary of the request because <a href="Juliet_Capulet" title="wikilink">Juliet</a> is still only thirteen. Capulet asks Paris to wait another two years and invites him to attend a planned Capulet <a href="Ball_(dance)" title="wikilink">ball</a>. Lady Capulet and Juliet's nurse try to persuade Juliet to accept Paris' courtship. After the brawl, <a href="Benvolio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Benvolio</a> talks with his cousin <a href="Romeo_Montague" title="wikilink">Romeo</a>, Lord Montague's son, about Romeo's recent depression. Benvolio discovers that it stems from unrequited love for a girl named <a href="Rosaline" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rosaline</a>, one of Lord Capulet's nieces. Persuaded by Benvolio and <a href="Mercutio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mercutio</a>, Romeo attends the ball at the Capulet house in hopes of meeting Rosaline. However, Romeo instead meets and falls in love with Juliet. After the ball, in what is now called the &quot;balcony scene&quot;, Romeo sneaks into the Capulet courtyard and overhears Juliet on her balcony vowing her love to him in spite of her family's hatred of the Montagues. Romeo makes himself known to her and they agree to be married.</p>
<p>With the help of <a href="Friar_Lawrence" title="wikilink">Friar Laurence</a>, who hopes to reconcile the two families through their children's union, they are married secretly the next day. Juliet's cousin <a href="Tybalt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tybalt</a>, offended that Romeo had snuck into the Capulet ball, challenges him to a duel. Romeo, now considering Tybalt his kinsman, refuses to fight him. Mercutio is incensed by Tybalt's insolence, as well as Romeo's &quot;vile submission&quot;,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and accepts the duel on Romeo's behalf. Mercutio is fatally wounded and Romeo, angered by his friend's death, pursues and slays Tybalt. The Prince exiles Romeo from Verona for the killing. He also adds that if Romeo returns, &quot;that hour is his last&quot;. Lord Capulet, misinterpreting Juliet's grief, agrees to marry her to Count Paris and threatens to disown her when she refuses to become Paris's &quot;joyful bride&quot;. When she then pleads for the marriage to be delayed, her mother rejects her. Romeo secretly spends the night in Juliet's chamber, where they <a href="consummate" class="uri" title="wikilink">consummate</a> their marriage.</p>
<p>Juliet visits Friar Laurence for help, and he offers her a drug which will put her into a death-like coma for &quot;two and forty hours&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The Friar promises to send a messenger to inform Romeo of the plan, so that he can rejoin her when she awakens. On the night before the wedding, she takes the drug and, when discovered apparently dead, she is laid in the family crypt.</p>
<p>The messenger, however, does not reach Romeo and, instead, he learns of Juliet's apparent death from his servant Balthasar. Grief-stricken, Romeo buys poison from an <a href="Characters_in_Romeo_and_Juliet#Apothecary" title="wikilink">apothecary</a> and goes to the Capulet crypt. He encounters Paris who has come to mourn Juliet privately. Believing Romeo to be a vandal Paris confronts him and, in the ensuing battle, Romeo kills Paris. Still believing Juliet to be dead, he drinks the poison. Juliet then awakens and, finding Romeo dead, stabs herself with his dagger. The feuding families and the Prince meet at the tomb to find all three dead. Friar Laurence recounts the story of the two &quot;star-cross'd lovers&quot;. The families are reconciled by their children's deaths and agree to end their violent feud. The play ends with the Prince's elegy for the lovers: &quot;For never was a story of more woe / Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p><em>Romeo and Juliet</em> borrows from a tradition of tragic love stories dating back to antiquity. One of these is <a href="Pyramus_and_Thisbe" title="wikilink">Pyramus and Thisbe</a>, from <a href="Ovid" title="wikilink">Ovid's</a> <a href="Metamorphoses" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metamorphoses</a>, which contains parallels to Shakespeare's story: the lovers' parents despise each other, and Pyramus falsely believes his lover Thisbe is dead.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The <em><a href="Ephesian_Tale" title="wikilink">Ephisiaca</a></em> of <a href="Xenophon" title="wikilink">Xenophon of Ephesus</a>, written in the 3rd century, also contains several similarities to the play, including the separation of the lovers, and a potion which induces a deathlike sleep.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The earliest known version of the <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> tale is the story of Mariotto and Gianozza by <a href="Masuccio_Salernitano" title="wikilink">Masuccio Salernitano</a>, in the 33rd novel of his <em>Il Novellino</em> published in 1476.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Salernitano sets the story in <a href="Siena" class="uri" title="wikilink">Siena</a> and insists its events took place in his own lifetime. His version of the story includes the secret marriage, the colluding friar, the fray where a prominent citizen is killed, Mariotto's exile, Gianozza's forced marriage, the potion plot, and the crucial message that goes astray. In this version, Mariotto is caught and beheaded and Gianozza dies of grief.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Luigi_da_Porto" title="wikilink">Luigi da Porto</a> adapted the story as <em>Giulietta e Romeo</em> and included it in his <em>Historia novellamente ritrovata di due Nobili Amanti</em> published in 1530.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Da Porto drew on <em>Pyramus and Thisbe</em> and <a href="Giovanni_Boccaccio" title="wikilink">Boccacio's</a> <a href="Decameron" class="uri" title="wikilink">Decameron</a>. He gave it much of its modern form, including the names of the lovers, the rival families of Montecchi and Capuleti, and the location in <a href="Verona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Verona</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He also introduces characters corresponding to Shakespeare's <a href="Mercutio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mercutio</a>, <a href="Tybalt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tybalt</a>, and <a href="Count_Paris" title="wikilink">Paris</a>. Da Porto presents his tale as historically true and claims it took place in the days of <a href="Bartolomeo_II_della_Scala" title="wikilink">Bartolomeo II della Scala</a> (a century earlier than Salernitano). Montecchi and Capuleti were actual 13th-century political factions, but the only connection between them is a mention in <a href="Dante" title="wikilink">Dante's</a> <a href="Divine_Comedy#Purgatorio" title="wikilink">Purgatorio</a> as an example of civil dissention.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In da Porto's version Romeo takes poison and Giulietta stabs herself with his dagger.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1554, <a href="Matteo_Bandello" title="wikilink">Matteo Bandello</a> published the second volume of his <em>Novelle</em> which included his version of <em>Giuletta e Romeo</em>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Bandello emphasises Romeo's initial depression and the feud between the families, and introduces the <a href="Nurse_(Romeo_and_Juliet_character)" title="wikilink">Nurse</a> and <a href="Benvolio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Benvolio</a>. Bandello's story was translated into French by <a href="Pierre_Boaistuau" title="wikilink">Pierre Boaistuau</a> in 1559 in the first volume of his <em>Histories Tragiques</em>.

<p><a href="Christopher_Marlowe" title="wikilink">Christopher Marlowe's</a> <em><a href="Hero_and_Leander_(poem)" title="wikilink">Hero and Leander</a></em> and <em><a href="Dido,_Queen_of_Carthage" title="wikilink">Dido, Queen of Carthage</a></em>, both similar stories written in Shakespeare's day, are thought to be less of a direct influence, although they may have created an atmosphere in which tragic love stories could thrive.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Romeo_and_Juliet_Q2_Title_Page-2.jpg" title="fig:Title page of the Second Quarto of Romeo and Juliet published in 1599" alt="Title page of the Second Quarto of Romeo and Juliet published in 1599" /> It is unknown when exactly Shakespeare wrote <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. Juliet's nurse refers to an earthquake which she says occurred 11 years ago.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> An earthquake did occur in England in 1580, possibly dating that particular line to 1591, although other earthquakes&lt;U+2014&gt;both in England and in Verona&lt;U+2014&gt;have been proposed in support of different dates.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> But the play's stylistic similarities with <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> and other plays conventionally dated around 1594&lt;U+2013&gt;95, place its composition sometime between 1591 and 1595.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> One conjecture is that Shakespeare may have begun a draft in 1591, which he completed in 1595.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Shakespeare's <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> was published in two <a href="quarto_(text)" title="wikilink">quarto</a> editions prior to the publication of the <a href="First_Folio" title="wikilink">First Folio</a> of 1623. These are referred to as Q1 and Q2. The first printed edition, Q1, appeared in early 1597, printed by John Danter. Because its text contains numerous differences from the later editions, it is labelled a '<a href="bad_quarto" title="wikilink">bad quarto</a>'; the 20th-century editor T. J. B. Spencer described it as &quot;a detestable text, probably a reconstruction of the play from the imperfect memories of one or two of the actors&quot;, suggesting that it had been pirated for publication.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> An alternative explanation for Q1's shortcomings is that the play (like many others of the time) may have been heavily edited before performance by the playing company.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In any event, its appearance in early 1597 makes 1596 the latest possible date for the play's composition.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The superior Q2 called the play <em>The Most Excellent and Lamentable Tragedie of Romeo and Juliet</em>. It was printed in 1599 by <a href="Thomas_Creede" title="wikilink">Thomas Creede</a> and published by <a href="Cuthbert_Burby" title="wikilink">Cuthbert Burby</a>. Q2 is about 800 lines longer than Q1.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Its title page describes it as &quot;Newly corrected, augmented and amended&quot;. Scholars believe that Q2 was based on Shakespeare's pre-performance draft (called his <a href="foul_papers" title="wikilink">foul papers</a>), since there are textual oddities such as variable tags for characters and &quot;false starts&quot; for speeches that were presumably struck through by the author but erroneously preserved by the typesetter. It is a much more complete and reliable text, and was reprinted in 1609 (Q3), 1622 (Q4) and 1637 (Q5).<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In effect, all later Quartos and Folios of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> are based on Q2, as are all modern editions since editors believe that any deviations from Q2 in the later editions (whether good or bad) are likely to arise from editors or compositors, not from Shakespeare.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>The First Folio text of 1623 was based primarily on Q3, with clarifications and corrections possibly coming from a theatrical promptbook or Q1.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Other Folio editions of the play were printed in 1632 (F2), 1664 (F3), and 1685 (F4).<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Modern versions&lt;U+2014&gt;that take into account several of the Folios and Quartos&lt;U+2014&gt;first appeared with <a href="Nicholas_Rowe_(dramatist)" title="wikilink">Nicholas Rowe's</a> 1709 edition, followed by <a href="Alexander_Pope" title="wikilink">Alexander Pope's</a> 1723 version. Pope began a tradition of editing the play to add information such as stage directions missing in Q2 by locating them in Q1. This tradition continued late into the <a href="Romanticism" title="wikilink">Romantic</a> period. Fully annotated editions first appeared in the <a href="Victorian_period" title="wikilink">Victorian period</a> and continue to be produced today, printing the text of the play with footnotes describing the sources and culture behind the play.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="themes-and-motifs">Themes and motifs</h2>
<p>Scholars have found it extremely difficult to assign one specific, over-arching <a href="Theme_(literature)" title="wikilink">theme</a> to the play. Proposals for a main theme include a discovery by the characters that human beings are neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead are more or less alike,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> awaking out of a dream and into reality, the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate. None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found it is clear that the play is full of several small, thematic elements which intertwine in complex ways. Several of those which are most often debated by scholars are discussed below.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="love">Love</h3>

<p><em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is sometimes considered to have no unifying theme, save that of young love.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Romeo and Juliet have become emblematic of young lovers and doomed love. Since it is such an obvious subject of the play, several scholars have explored the language and historical context behind the romance of the play.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>On their first meeting, Romeo and Juliet use a form of communication recommended by many etiquette authors in Shakespeare's day: metaphor. By using metaphors of saints and sins, Romeo was able to test Juliet's feelings for him in a non-threatening way. This method was recommended by <a href="Baldassare_Castiglione" title="wikilink">Baldassare Castiglione</a> (whose works had been translated into English by this time). He pointed out that if a man used a metaphor as an invitation, the woman could pretend she did not understand him, and he could retreat without losing honour. Juliet, however, participates in the metaphor and expands on it. The religious metaphors of &quot;shrine&quot;, &quot;pilgrim&quot; and &quot;saint&quot; were fashionable in the poetry of the time and more likely to be understood as romantic rather than blasphemous, as the concept of sainthood was associated with the Catholicism of an earlier age.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Later in the play, Shakespeare removes the more daring allusions to Christ's resurrection in the tomb he found in his source work: Brooke's <em><a href="The_Tragical_History_of_Romeus_and_Juliet" title="wikilink">Romeus and Juliet</a></em>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>In the later balcony scene, Shakespeare has Romeo overhear Juliet's soliloquy, but in Brooke's version of the story her declaration is done alone. By bringing Romeo into the scene to eavesdrop, Shakespeare breaks from the normal sequence of courtship. Usually a woman was required to be modest and shy to make sure that her suitor was sincere, but breaking this rule serves to speed along the plot. The lovers are able to skip a lengthy part of wooing, and move on to plain talk about their relationship—developing into an agreement to be married after knowing each other for only one night.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In the final suicide scene, there is a contradiction in the message&lt;U+2014&gt;in the Catholic religion, suicides were often thought to be condemned to hell, whereas people who die to be with their loves under the &quot;<a href="Courtly_love" title="wikilink">Religion of Love</a>&quot; are joined with their loves in paradise. Romeo and Juliet's love seems to be expressing the &quot;Religion of Love&quot; view rather than the Catholic view. Another point is that although their love is passionate, it is only consummated in marriage, which prevents them from losing the audience's sympathy.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>The play arguably equates love and sex with death. Throughout the story, both Romeo and Juliet, along with the other characters, fantasize about <a href="Death_(personification)" title="wikilink">it as a dark being</a>, often equating it with a lover. Capulet, for example, when he first discovers Juliet's (faked) death, describes it as having <a href="virginity" title="wikilink">deflowered</a> his daughter.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Juliet later erotically compares Romeo and death. Right before her suicide she grabs Romeo's dagger, saying &quot;O happy dagger! This is thy sheath.

<h3 id="fate-and-chance">Fate and chance</h3>

<p>Scholars are divided on the role of fate in the play. No consensus exists on whether the characters are truly fated to die together or whether the events take place by a series of unlucky chances. Arguments in favour of fate often refer to the description of the lovers as &quot;star-cross'd&quot;.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> This phrase seems to hint that the stars have predetermined the lovers' future.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> John W. Draper points out the parallels between the Elizabethan belief in <a href="the_four_humors" title="wikilink">the four humors</a> and the main characters of the play (for example, Tybalt as a choleric). Interpreting the text in the light of humours reduces the amount of plot attributed to chance by modern audiences.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Still, other scholars see the play as a series of unlucky chances&lt;U+2014&gt;many to such a degree that they do not see it as a tragedy at all, but an emotional <a href="melodrama" class="uri" title="wikilink">melodrama</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Ruth Nevo believes the high degree to which chance is stressed in the narrative makes <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> a &quot;lesser tragedy&quot; of happenstance, not of character. For example, Romeo's challenging Tybalt is not impulsive, it is, after Mercutio's death, the expected action to take. In this scene, Nevo reads Romeo as being aware of the dangers of flouting <a href="Norm_(sociology)" title="wikilink">social norms</a>, identity and commitments. He makes the choice to kill, not because of a <a href="tragic_flaw" title="wikilink">tragic flaw</a>, but because of circumstance.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="light-and-dark">Light and dark</h3>

<p>Scholars have long noted Shakespeare's widespread use of light and dark <a href="imagery" class="uri" title="wikilink">imagery</a> throughout the play. Caroline Spurgeon considers the theme of light as &quot;symbolic of the natural beauty of young love&quot; and later critics have expanded on this interpretation.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> For example, both Romeo and Juliet see the other as light in a surrounding darkness. Romeo describes Juliet as being like the sun,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> brighter than a torch,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> a jewel sparkling in the night,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> and a bright angel among dark clouds.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Even when she lies apparently dead in the tomb, he says her &quot;beauty makes / This vault a feasting presence full of light.&quot;<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Juliet describes Romeo as &quot;day in night&quot; and &quot;Whiter than snow upon a raven's back.&quot;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> This contrast of light and dark can be expanded as symbols&lt;U+2014&gt;contrasting love and hate, youth and age in a metaphoric way.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Sometimes these intertwining metaphors create <a href="Irony" title="wikilink">dramatic irony</a>. For example, Romeo and Juliet's love is a light in the midst of the darkness of the hate around them, but all of their activity together is done in night and darkness, while all of the feuding is done in broad daylight. This paradox of imagery adds atmosphere to the <a href="Ethical_dilemma" title="wikilink">moral dilemma</a> facing the two lovers: loyalty to family or loyalty to love. At the end of the story, when the morning is gloomy and the sun hiding its face for sorrow, light and dark have returned to their proper places, the outward darkness reflecting the true, inner darkness of the family feud out of sorrow for the lovers. All characters now recognise their folly in light of recent events, and things return to the natural order, thanks to the love of Romeo and Juliet.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The &quot;light&quot; theme in the play is also heavily connected to the theme of time, since light was a convenient way for Shakespeare to express the passage of time through descriptions of the sun, moon, and stars.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="time">Time</h3>

<p>Time plays an important role in the language and plot of the play. Both Romeo and Juliet struggle to maintain an imaginary world void of time in the face of the harsh realities that surround them. For instance, when Romeo swears his love to Juliet by the moon, she protests &quot;O swear not by the moon, th'inconstant moon, / That monthly changes in her circled orb, / Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.&quot;<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> From the very beginning, the lovers are designated as &quot;star-cross'd&quot;<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> referring to an <a href="astrology" title="wikilink">astrologic</a> belief associated with time. Stars were thought to control the fates of humanity, and as time passed, stars would move along their course in the sky, also charting the course of human lives below. Romeo speaks of a foreboding he feels in the stars' movements early in the play, and when he learns of Juliet's death, he defies the stars' course for him.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>Another central theme is haste: Shakespeare's <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> spans a period of four to six days, in contrast to Brooke's poem's spanning nine months.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Scholars such as G. Thomas Tanselle believe that time was &quot;especially important to Shakespeare&quot; in this play, as he used references to &quot;short-time&quot; for the young lovers as opposed to references to &quot;long-time&quot; for the &quot;older generation&quot; to highlight &quot;a headlong rush towards doom&quot;.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Romeo and Juliet fight time to make their love last forever. In the end, the only way they seem to defeat time is through a death which makes them immortal through art.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>Time is also connected to the theme of light and dark. In Shakespeare's day, plays were often performed at noon in broad daylight. This forced the playwright to use words to create the illusion of day and night in his plays. Shakespeare uses references to the night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to create this illusion. He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story. All in all, no fewer than 103 references to time are found in the play, adding to the illusion of its passage.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="criticism-and-interpretation">Criticism and interpretation</h2>
<h3 id="critical-history">Critical history</h3>
<p><img src="Samuel_Pepys.jpg" title="fig:Portrait of the earliest recorded critic of the play, Samuel Pepys, by John Hayls. Oil on canvas, 1666." alt="Portrait of the earliest recorded critic of the play, Samuel Pepys, by John Hayls. Oil on canvas, 1666." /> Critics have noted many weak points in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, but it is still regarded as one of Shakespeare's best plays. The earliest known critic of the play was diarist <a href="Samuel_Pepys" title="wikilink">Samuel Pepys</a>, who wrote in 1662: &quot;it is a play of itself the worst that I ever heard in my life.&quot;<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Poet <a href="John_Dryden" title="wikilink">John Dryden</a> wrote 10 years later in praise of the play and its comic character Mercutio: &quot;Shakespear show'd the best of his skill in his <em>Mercutio</em>, and he said himself, that he was forc'd to kill him in the third Act, to prevent being killed by him.&quot;<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Criticism of the play in the 18th century was less sparse, but no less divided. Publisher <a href="Nicholas_Rowe_(dramatist)" title="wikilink">Nicholas Rowe</a> was the first critic to ponder the theme of the play, which he saw as the just punishment of the two feuding families. In mid-century, writer <a href="Charles_Gildon" title="wikilink">Charles Gildon</a> and philosopher <a href="Lord_Kames" title="wikilink">Lord Kames</a> argued that the play was a failure in that it did not follow the classical rules of drama: the tragedy must occur because of some <a href="Hamartia" title="wikilink">character flaw</a>, not an accident of fate. Writer and critic <a href="Samuel_Johnson" title="wikilink">Samuel Johnson</a>, however, considered it one of Shakespeare's &quot;most pleasing&quot; plays.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>In the later part of the 18th and through the 19th century, criticism centred on debates over the moral message of the play. Actor and playwright <a href="David_Garrick" title="wikilink">David Garrick's</a> 1748 adaptation excluded Rosaline: Romeo abandoning her for Juliet was seen as fickle and reckless. Critics such as <a href="Charles_Dibdin" title="wikilink">Charles Dibdin</a> argued that Rosaline had been purposely included in the play to show how reckless the hero was, and that this was the reason for his tragic end. Others argued that Friar Laurence might be Shakespeare's spokesman in his warnings against undue haste. With the advent of the 20th century, these moral arguments were disputed by critics like <a href="Richard_Green_Moulton" title="wikilink">Richard Green Moulton</a>. He argued that accident, and not some character flaw, led to the lovers' deaths.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="dramatic-structure">Dramatic structure</h3>
<p>In <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, Shakespeare employs several dramatic techniques that have garnered praise from critics; most notably the abrupt shifts from comedy to tragedy (an example is the <a href="punning" class="uri" title="wikilink">punning</a> exchange between Romeo and Mercutio just before Tybalt arrives). Before Mercutio's death in Act three, the play is largely a comedy.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> After his accidental demise, the play suddenly becomes serious and takes on a tragic tone. When Romeo is banished, rather than executed, and Friar Laurence offers Juliet a plan to reunite her with Romeo, the audience can still hope that all will end well. They are in a &quot;breathless state of suspense&quot; by the opening of the last scene in the tomb: If Romeo is delayed long enough for the Friar to arrive, he and Juliet may yet be saved.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> These shifts from hope to despair, reprieve, and new hope, serve to emphasise the tragedy when the final hope fails and both the lovers die at the end.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>Shakespeare also uses sub-plots to offer a clearer view of the actions of the main characters. For example, when the play begins, Romeo is in love with Rosaline, who has refused all of his advances. Romeo's infatuation with her stands in obvious contrast to his later love for Juliet. This provides a comparison through which the audience can see the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet's love and marriage. Paris' love for Juliet also sets up a contrast between Juliet's feelings for him and her feelings for Romeo. The formal language she uses around Paris, as well as the way she talks about him to her Nurse, show that her feelings clearly lie with Romeo. Beyond this, the <a href="Subplot" title="wikilink">sub-plot</a> of the Montague&lt;U+2013&gt;Capulet feud overarches the whole play, providing an atmosphere of hate that is the main contributor to the play's tragic end.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="language">Language</h3>
<p>Shakespeare uses a variety of poetic forms throughout the play. He begins with a 14-line <a href="prologue" class="uri" title="wikilink">prologue</a> in the form of a <a href="Shakespearean_sonnet" title="wikilink">Shakespearean sonnet</a>, spoken by a Chorus. Most of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is, however, written in <a href="blank_verse" title="wikilink">blank verse</a>, and much of it in strict <a href="iambic_pentameter" title="wikilink">iambic pentameter</a>, with less rhythmic variation than in most of Shakespeare's later plays.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> In choosing forms, Shakespeare matches the poetry to the character who uses it. Friar Laurence, for example, uses <a href="sermon" class="uri" title="wikilink">sermon</a> and <a href="sententiae" class="uri" title="wikilink">sententiae</a> forms, and the Nurse uses a unique <a href="blank_verse" title="wikilink">blank verse</a> form that closely matches <a href="colloquial_speech" title="wikilink">colloquial speech</a>.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Each of these forms is also moulded and matched to the emotion of the scene the character occupies. For example, when Romeo talks about Rosaline earlier in the play, he attempts to use the <a href="Petrarchan_sonnet" title="wikilink">Petrarchan sonnet</a> form. Petrarchan sonnets were often used by men to exaggerate the beauty of women who were impossible for them to attain, as in Romeo's situation with Rosaline. This sonnet form is used by Lady Capulet to describe Count Paris to Juliet as a handsome man.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> When Romeo and Juliet meet, the poetic form changes from the Petrarchan (which was becoming archaic in Shakespeare's day) to a then more contemporary sonnet form, using &quot;pilgrims&quot; and &quot;saints&quot; as metaphors.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Finally, when the two meet on the balcony, Romeo attempts to use the sonnet form to pledge his love, but Juliet breaks it by saying &quot;Dost thou love me?&quot;<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> By doing this, she searches for true expression, rather than a poetic exaggeration of their love.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Juliet uses monosyllabic words with Romeo, but uses formal language with Paris.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Other forms in the play include an <a href="epithalamium" class="uri" title="wikilink">epithalamium</a> by Juliet, a <a href="Epic_poetry" title="wikilink">rhapsody</a> in Mercutio's <a href="Queen_Mab" title="wikilink">Queen Mab</a> speech, and an <a href="elegy" class="uri" title="wikilink">elegy</a> by Paris.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Shakespeare saves his prose style most often for the common people in the play, though at times he uses it for other characters, such as Mercutio.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Humour, also, is important: scholar Molly Mahood identifies at least 175 puns and wordplays in the text.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Many of these jokes are sexual in nature, especially those involving Mercutio and the Nurse.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="psychoanalytic-criticism">Psychoanalytic criticism</h3>
<p>Early <a href="Psychoanalytic_criticism" title="wikilink">psychoanalytic critics</a> saw the problem of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> in terms of Romeo's impulsiveness, deriving from &quot;ill-controlled, partially disguised aggression&quot;, which leads both to Mercutio's death and to the double suicide.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is not considered to be exceedingly psychologically complex, and sympathetic psychoanalytic readings of the play make the tragic male experience equivalent with sicknesses.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Norman Holland, writing in 1966, considers Romeo's dream<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> as a realistic &quot;wish fulfilling fantasy both in terms of Romeo's adult world and his hypothetical childhood at stages oral, phallic and oedipal&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; while acknowledging that a dramatic character is not a human being with mental processes separate from those of the author.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Critics such as <a href="Julia_Kristeva" title="wikilink">Julia Kristeva</a> focus on the hatred between the families, arguing that this hatred is the cause of Romeo and Juliet's passion for each other. That hatred manifests itself directly in the lovers' language: Juliet, for example, speaks of &quot;my only love sprung from my only hate&quot;<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> and often expresses her passion through an anticipation of Romeo's death.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> This leads on to speculation as to the playwright's psychology, in particular to a consideration of Shakespeare's grief for the death of his son, <a href="Hamnet_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">Hamnet</a>.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="feminist-criticism">Feminist criticism</h3>
<p><a href="Feminist_literary_criticism" title="wikilink">Feminist critics</a> argue that the blame for the family feud lies in Verona's <a href="patriarchal_society" title="wikilink">patriarchal society</a>. For Copp&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia Kahn, for example, the strict, masculine code of violence imposed on Romeo is the main force driving the tragedy to its end. When Tybalt kills Mercutio, Romeo shifts into this violent mode, regretting that Juliet has made him so &quot;effeminate&quot;.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> In this view, the younger males &quot;become men&quot; by engaging in violence on behalf of their fathers, or in the case of the servants, their masters. The feud is also linked to male virility, as the numerous jokes about maidenheads aptly demonstrate.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Juliet also submits to a female code of docility by allowing others, such as the Friar, to solve her problems for her. Other critics, such as Dympna Callaghan, look at the play's <a href="feminism" class="uri" title="wikilink">feminism</a> from an <a href="Historicism" title="wikilink">historicist</a> angle, stressing that when the play was written the feudal order was being challenged by increasingly centralised government and the advent of <a href="capitalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">capitalism</a>. At the same time, emerging <a href="Puritan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Puritan</a> ideas about marriage were less concerned with the &quot;evils of female sexuality&quot; than those of earlier eras, and more sympathetic towards love-matches: so when Juliet dodges her father's attempt to force her to marry a man she has no feeling for, she is challenging the patriarchal order in a way that would not have been possible at an earlier time.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="queer-theory">Queer theory</h3>
<p><a href="Queer_theory" title="wikilink">Queer studies</a> critics question the sexuality of Mercutio and Romeo, comparing their friendship with sexual love. Mercutio, in friendly conversation, mentions Romeo's <a href="phallus" class="uri" title="wikilink">phallus</a>, suggesting traces of <a href="homoeroticism" class="uri" title="wikilink">homoeroticism</a>.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> An example is his joking wish &quot;To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle ... letting it there stand / Till she had laid it and conjured it down.&quot;<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a><a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Romeo's homoeroticism can also be found in his attitude to Rosaline, a woman who is distant and unavailable and brings no hope of offspring. As Benvolio argues, she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate. Shakespeare's <a href="procreation_sonnets" title="wikilink">procreation sonnets</a> describe another young man who, like Romeo, is having trouble creating offspring and who is homosexual. Gender critics believe that Shakespeare may have used Rosaline as a way to express homosexual problems of procreation in an acceptable way. In this view, when Juliet says &quot;...that which we call a rose [or Rosaline] / By any other name would smell as sweet&quot;,<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between the beauty of a man and the beauty of a woman.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Peter_Brook" title="wikilink">Peter Brook's</a> 1947 version was the beginning of a different style of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> performances. Brook was less concerned with realism, and more concerned with translating the play into a form that could communicate with the modern world.

<li id="fn1"><em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, I.0.6. Levenson (2000: 142) defines &quot;star-cross'd&quot; as &quot;thwarted by a malign star&quot;.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn2">Gibbons (1980: 80); Levenson (2000: 139-140); Spencer (1967: 51-52). This section lists only the major and supporting characters. The play also has numerous supernumiaries: further servants of Capulet (two of them named Antony and Potpan), musicians (three of them named Simon Catling, Hugh Rebeck and James Soundpost), watchmen, citizens of Verona, masquers, torchbearers and pages. Paris' page is a minor speaking role, as is Capulet's cousin, an old man. Levenson renders Abram as &quot;Abraham&quot;. Rosaline is an important unseen character, and as such does not appear in any cast list.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
