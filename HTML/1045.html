<h2 id="greeting-cook">Greeting Cook</h2>
<p>Upon Cook's first arrival to Hawaii, Kanaina was one of two chiefs to first greet the navigator.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> One of the ships crew writes: </p>
<p>Kanaina had been of help to the foreigners from very early on, even after some mistreatment by the crew of the <em>Resolution</em> when the chief had urged a common islander to suggest too high a price for his pig. Many of the other chiefs were less respectful of the newcomers and stole heavily. An islander had grabbed a chisel and tongs and jumped overboard. Cook and <a href="James_King_(Royal_Navy_officer)" title="wikilink">James King</a> searched beach under harassment from the townspeople of the Island. Cooks had to make threats of firing his weapon with little success in intimidating the crowds.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>When Cook was on the beach with the King in hand, a group of islanders began to gather in mass on the surrounding beach. In the <a href="melee" class="uri" title="wikilink">melee</a> Cook struck the chief first with his sword. Kalaimanokaho&lt;U+02BB&gt;owaha immediately seized Cook and held him in his grip when the king's attendant, a lower ranking chief named, Nuaa stabbed Cook from behind.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <a href="Sheldon_Dibble" title="wikilink">Sheldon Dibble</a> says that Cook shot and killed the man who struck him with a stone and also struck Kanaina, who quickly seized the British Commander. Cook is said to have let out a groan when an islander struck him on the head knocking him to the ground where he dropped and lost his musket. As he was rising, he was stabbed by one of the chiefs.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
