<p>The <strong>University of Cambridge</strong> (often <strong>Cambridge University</strong>), located in <a href="Cambridge" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cambridge</a>, <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, is the <a href="List_of_oldest_universities_in_continuous_operation" title="wikilink">second-oldest</a> university in the English-speaking world and has a <a href="University_of_Cambridge#Reputation" title="wikilink">reputation</a> as one of the world's most prestigious universities.</p>
<p>The University grew out of an association of scholars in the city of Cambridge that was formed, <a href="University_of_Cambridge#Early_history" title="wikilink">early records suggest</a>, in 1209 by scholars leaving <a href="Oxford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxford</a> after a dispute with local townsfolk there.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The universities of <a href="University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">Oxford</a> and Cambridge are often jointly referred to as <em><a href="Oxbridge" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxbridge</a></em>. In addition to cultural and practical associations as a historic part of <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> society, the two universities also have a long <a href="Oxbridge_rivalry" title="wikilink">history of rivalry</a> with each other.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cantabrigian</em></strong> is the formal adjective meaning &quot;of Cambridge University&quot; which is also used as a term for the university's members (abbreviated as <strong><em>Cantab.</em></strong> in <a href="post-nominal_letters" title="wikilink">post-nominal letters</a> for alumni).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Cambridge is a <a href="collegiate_university" title="wikilink">collegiate university</a>, with its main functions divided between the central departments of the university and 31 <a href="Colleges_of_the_University_of_Cambridge" title="wikilink">colleges</a>. In general, the departments perform research and provide centralised lectures to students, while the colleges are responsible for the domestic arrangements and welfare of undergraduate students, graduate students, some of the postdocs and some University staff. The colleges also provide most of the small group teaching for undergraduates, referred to as <a href="Tutorial" title="wikilink">supervisions</a>. The 31 colleges are technically institutions independent of the university itself and enjoy considerable autonomy. For example, colleges decide which students they are to admit, and appoint their own <a href="fellow" title="wikilink">fellows</a> (senior members). In Cambridge, &lt;U+201C&gt;the university&lt;U+201D&gt; often refers to the University as opposed to the colleges.</p>

<p>The current <a href="Chancellor_(education)" title="wikilink">Chancellor</a> of the university is the <a href="Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh" title="wikilink">Duke of Edinburgh</a>. The current <a href="Vice-Chancellor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vice-Chancellor</a> is <a href="Alison_Fettes_Richard" title="wikilink">Professor Alison Richard</a>. The office of Chancellor, which is held for life, is mainly ceremonial, while the Vice-Chancellor is <em>de facto</em> the prinicipal academic and administrative officer. The University's internal governance is carried out almost entirely by its own members, with little external representation on its governing bodies with the exception of the Audit Committee. The governing body of the University is the <a href="Regent_House" title="wikilink">Regent House</a> (comprised of resident senior members of the University and the Colleges, together with the Chancellor, the <a href="High_Steward_(academia)" title="wikilink">High Steward</a>, the Deputy High Steward, and the Commissary). The University Council is the principal executive and policy-making body of the University, and is subject to Regent House. Since January 2005, the membership of the Council has included two external members.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The General Board of the Faculties is responsible, subject to the Regent House and to the responsibilities of the Council, for the academic and educational policy of the University.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The Cambridge Reporter Regent House and The Senate consists of all holders of the <a href="Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge_and_Dublin)" title="wikilink">MA</a> degree or higher degrees.

<p>The University of Cambridge currently has 31 <a href="Colleges_within_UK_Universities" title="wikilink">colleges</a>, of which three admit only women (<a href="New_Hall,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">New Hall</a>, <a href="Newnham_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Newnham</a> and <a href="Lucy_Cavendish_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Lucy Cavendish</a>). The remaining 28 are mixed, <a href="Magdalene_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Magdalene</a> being the last all-male college to begin admitting women in 1988. Two colleges admit only <a href="postgraduate" title="wikilink">postgraduates</a> (<a href="Clare_Hall,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Clare Hall</a> and <a href="Darwin_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Darwin</a>), and four more admit mainly <a href="mature_student" title="wikilink">mature students</a> or <a href="graduate_student" title="wikilink">graduate students</a> (<a href="Hughes_Hall,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Hughes Hall</a>, <a href="Lucy_Cavendish_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Lucy Cavendish</a>, <a href="St_Edmund&#39;s_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">St Edmund&lt;U+2019&gt;s</a> and <a href="Wolfson_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Wolfson</a>). The other 25 colleges admit mainly <a href="undergraduate" class="uri" title="wikilink">undergraduate</a> students, but also postgraduates following courses of study or research. Although various colleges are traditionally strong in a particular subject, for example <a href="Churchill_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Churchill</a> has a formalised bias towards the <a href="science" title="wikilink">sciences</a> and <a href="engineering" class="uri" title="wikilink">engineering</a>, the colleges all admit students from just about the whole range of subjects, although some colleges do not take students for a handful of subjects such as <a href="architecture" class="uri" title="wikilink">architecture</a> or <a href="history_of_art" title="wikilink">history of art</a>. It is noteworthy that costs to students (accommodation and food prices) vary considerably from college to college. This may be of increasing significance to potential applicants as Government grants decline in the next few years.</p>
<p>There are several historical colleges which no longer exist, such as <a href="King&#39;s_Hall" title="wikilink">King&lt;U+2019&gt;s Hall</a> (founded in 1317) and <a href="Michaelhouse,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Michaelhouse</a> which were combined together by <a href="Henry_VIII_of_England" title="wikilink">King Henry VIII</a> to establish <a href="Trinity_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Trinity</a> in 1546, and Gonville Hall which was founded in 1348 and then re-founded in 1557 as <a href="Gonville_and_Caius_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Gonville &amp; Caius</a>.</p>
<p>There are also several theological colleges in Cambridge, (for example <a href="Westminster_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Westminster College</a> and <a href="Ridley_Hall,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Ridley Hall Theological College</a>) that are loosely affiliated with the university through the <a href="Cambridge_Theological_Federation" title="wikilink">Cambridge Theological Federation</a>.</p>

Cambridge tends to have a slight bias towards <a href="science" title="wikilink">scientific</a> subjects, but it also has a number of strong <a href="humanities" class="uri" title="wikilink">humanities</a> and <a href="social_sciences" title="wikilink">social science</a> faculties. Academic staff (and often graduate students for the larger subjects) teach the undergraduates in both lectures and personal <em>supervisions</em> in which a ratio of one teacher to between one and three students is usually maintained. This <a href="pedagogy" title="wikilink">pedagogical</a> system is often cited as being unique to the Universities of Cambridge and <a href="University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">Oxford</a> (where &lt;U+201C&gt;supervisions&lt;U+201D&gt; are known as &lt;U+201C&gt;tutorials&lt;U+201D&gt;) &lt;U+2013&gt; similar practices can be found elsewhere, though not on the <a href="Oxbridge" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxbridge</a> scale.</p>
<p>All research and lectures are conducted by University Departments. The colleges are in charge of giving or arranging most supervisions, student accommodation, and funding most extra-curricular activities. During the 1990s Cambridge added a substantial number of new specialist research laboratories on several University sites around the city, and major expansion continues on a number of sites<a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/building/">1</a>.</p>
<p>Cambridge is a member of the <a href="Russell_Group" title="wikilink">Russell Group</a>, a network of research-led British universities; the <a href="Coimbra_Group" title="wikilink">Coimbra Group</a>, an association of leading European universities; the <a href="League_of_European_Research_Universities" title="wikilink">League of European Research Universities</a>; and the <a href="International_Alliance_of_Research_Universities" title="wikilink">International Alliance of Research Universities</a>.

<h3 id="finances">Finances</h3>
<p>In 2006, it was reported that approximately one third of Cambridge&lt;U+2019&gt;s income comes from UK government funding for teaching and research, with another third coming from other research grants. Endowment income contributes around 6%.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In late 2006, the total financial endowment of the university and the colleges was estimated at &lt;U+00A3&gt;4.1 billion: &lt;U+00A3&gt;1.2 billion tied directly to the university, &lt;U+00A3&gt;2.9 billion to the colleges<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> &lt;U+2013&gt; this endowment is arguably the largest in Europe.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Each college is an independent charitable institution with its own endowment, separate from that of the central university endowment.</p>
<p>If ranked on a <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">US</a> university endowment table using figures reported in 2006, Cambridge would rank sixth or seventh (depending on whether one includes the <a href="University_of_Texas_System" title="wikilink">University of Texas System</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; which incorporates nine full scale universities and six health institutions), or fourth in a ranking compared with only the eight <a href="Ivy_League" title="wikilink">Ivy League</a> institutions.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2005, the <a href="http://www.foundation.cam.ac.uk/800-home.php">Cambridge 800th Anniversary Campaign</a> was launched, aimed at raising &lt;U+00A3&gt;1 billion by 2012 &lt;U+2013&gt; the first US-style university fundraising campaign in Europe. &lt;U+00A3&gt;300 million of funds had already been secured in the pre-launch period.</p>

<p>Cambridge is often rated extremely highly on British league tables. The 2008 edition of <a href="The_Good_University_Guide" title="wikilink">The Good University Guide</a> rated Cambridge overall first place.

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="early-history">Early history</h3>
<p><a href="Roger_of_Wendover" title="wikilink">Roger of Wendover</a> wrote that Cambridge University could trace its origins to a crime committed in 1209. Although not always a reliable source, the detail given in his contemporaneous writings lends them credence. Two Oxford scholars were convicted of the murder or manslaughter of a woman and were hanged by the town authorities with the assent of the King. In protest at the hanging, the <a href="University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">University of Oxford</a> went into voluntary suspension, and scholars migrated to a number of other locations, including the pre-existing school at Cambridge (Cambridge had been recorded as a &lt;U+201C&gt;school&lt;U+201D&gt; rather than University when John Grim held the office of Master there in 1201). These post-graduate researchers from Oxford started Cambridge&lt;U+2019&gt;s life as a University in 1209. Cambridge&lt;U+2019&gt;s status as a University is further confirmed by a decree in 1233 from <a href="Pope_Gregory_IX" title="wikilink">Pope Gregory IX</a> which awarded the <em><a href="ius_non_trahi_extra" title="wikilink">ius non trahi extra</a></em> (a form of legal protection) to the <em>chancellor and universitas of scholars</em> at Cambridge. After Cambridge was recognised by papal bull as a <em><a href="studium_generale" title="wikilink">studium generale</a></em> by <a href="Pope_Nicholas_IV" title="wikilink">Pope Nicholas IV</a> in 1290, it became common for researchers from other European <a href="medieval_universities" title="wikilink">medieval universities</a> to come and visit Cambridge to study or to give lecture courses.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

No college is as old as the university itself. The colleges were endowed fellowships of scholars. There were also institutions without endowments, called hostels. The hostels were gradually absorbed by the colleges over the centuries, but they have left some indicators of their time, such as the name of Garrett Hostel Lane.</p>
<p><a href="Hugh_Balsham" title="wikilink">Hugh Balsham</a>, <a href="Bishop" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bishop</a> of <a href="Ely" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ely</a>, founded <a href="Peterhouse,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Peterhouse</a> in 1284, Cambridge&lt;U+2019&gt;s first college. Many colleges were founded during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, but colleges continued to be established throughout the centuries to modern times, although there was a gap of 204 years between the founding of <a href="Sidney_Sussex_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Sidney Sussex</a> in 1596 and <a href="Downing_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Downing</a> in 1800. The most recent college established is <a href="Robinson_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Robinson</a>, built in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>In <a href="medieval" class="uri" title="wikilink">medieval</a> times, colleges were founded so that their students would <a href="pray" class="uri" title="wikilink">pray</a> for the <a href="soul" title="wikilink">souls</a> of the founders. For that reason they were often associated with <a href="chapel" title="wikilink">chapels</a> or <a href="abbey" title="wikilink">abbeys</a>. A change in the colleges&lt;U+2019&gt; focus occurred in 1536 with the <a href="Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries" title="wikilink">dissolution of the monasteries</a>. King <a href="Henry_VIII_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry VIII</a> ordered the university to disband its Faculty of Canon Law and to stop teaching &lt;U+201C&gt;<a href="scholastic_philosophy" title="wikilink">scholastic philosophy</a>&lt;U+201D&gt;. In response, colleges changed their curricula away from canon law and towards the <a href="classics" class="uri" title="wikilink">classics</a>, the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a>, and <a href="mathematics" class="uri" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>.</p>
<h3 id="mathematics">Mathematics</h3>
<p>From the time of <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Isaac Newton</a> in the later 17th century until the mid-19th century, the university maintained a strong emphasis on mathematics. Study of this subject was compulsory for graduation, and students were required to take an exam for the <a href="Bachelor_of_Arts" title="wikilink">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree, the main first degree at Cambridge in both arts and science subjects. This exam is known as a <a href="Tripos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tripos</a>. Students awarded <a href="British_undergraduate_degree_classification" title="wikilink">first-class honours</a> after completing the mathematics Tripos were named <a href="Wrangler_(University_of_Cambridge)" title="wikilink">wranglers</a>. The <a href="Cambridge_Mathematical_Tripos" title="wikilink">Cambridge Mathematical Tripos</a> was competitive and helped produce some of the most famous names in British science, including <a href="James_Clerk_Maxwell" title="wikilink">James Clerk Maxwell</a>, <a href="William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin" title="wikilink">Lord Kelvin</a>, and <a href="John_Strutt,_3rd_Baron_Rayleigh" title="wikilink">Lord Rayleigh</a>. However, some famous students, such as <a href="G._H._Hardy" title="wikilink">G. H.

<p>Although diversified in its research and teaching interests, Cambridge today maintains its strength in mathematics. The <a href="Isaac_Newton_Institute" title="wikilink">Isaac Newton Institute</a>, part of the university, is widely regarded as the UK&lt;U+2019&gt;s national research institute for mathematics and theoretical physics. Cambridge alumni have won eight <a href="Fields_Medal" title="wikilink">Fields Medals</a> and one <a href="Abel_Prize" title="wikilink">Abel Prize</a> for mathematics. The University also runs a special <a href="CASM" title="wikilink">Certificate of Advanced Studies in Mathematics</a> course.</p>
<h3 id="womenu2019s-education">Women&lt;U+2019&gt;s education</h3>
<p>Originally all students were male. The first colleges for women were <a href="Girton_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Girton College</a> (founded by <a href="Emily_Davies" title="wikilink">Emily Davies</a>) in 1869 and <a href="Newnham_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Newnham College</a> in 1872. The first women students were examined in 1882 but attempts to make women full members of the university did not succeed until 1947. Although Cambridge did not give degrees to women until this date women were in fact allowed to study courses, sit examinations, and have their results recorded from the nineteenth century onwards. In the twentieth century women could be given a &lt;U+201C&gt;titular degree&lt;U+201D&gt;; although they were not denied recognised qualifications, without a full degree they were excluded from the governing of the university. Since students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to colleges established only for women. All of the men&lt;U+2019&gt;s colleges began to admit women between 1960 and 1988. One women&lt;U+2019&gt;s college, Girton, also began to admit men, but the other women&lt;U+2019&gt;s colleges did not follow suit. In the academic year 2004-5, the university&lt;U+2019&gt;s student gender ratio, including post-graduates, was male 52%: female 48% (Source: Cambridge University Reporter, <a href="http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2004-05/special/19/">15</a>).</p>
<h2 id="admissions">Admissions</h2>
<h3 id="history-1">History</h3>

<p>The proportion drawn from independent schools has dropped over the years, and now form a significant minority of the intake. In 2005, UK applicants from private/independent schools accounted for about 40% of the total number of undergraduate acceptances<a href="http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2005-06/special/11/table1-1.pdf">16</a>, which is about the same proportion of private/independent applications.</p>

<p>The application system to Cambridge and <a href="University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">Oxford</a> often involves additional requirements. Candidates are also typically called to face-to-face interviews.</p>
<p>How applicants perform in the interview process best determines which candidates are accepted.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Most applicants are expected to be predicted at least three A-grade <a href="Advanced_Level_(UK)" title="wikilink">A-level</a> qualifications relevant to their chosen undergraduate course, or equivalent overseas qualifications. Due to a very high proportion receiving the highest school grades from the private and grammar schools, this makes the interview process crucial at distinguishing the most able candidates and important in trying to recruit from comprehensive schools.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In 2005, 5,325 students were rejected who went on to get 3 A levels or more at grade A, representing about 60% of all applicants rejected.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The interview is performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors such as potential for original thinking and creativity.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> For exceptional candidates, a <em>Matriculation Offer</em> is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above - <a href="Christ&#39;s_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Christ's College</a> is unusual in making this offer to about one-third of successful candidates.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In recent years, admissions tutors in certain subjects have required applicants to sit the more difficult <a href="Sixth_Term_Examination_Paper" title="wikilink">STEP papers</a>, tuition for which is not normally provided by British schools outside the private or independent sector, in addition to achieving top grades in their A-levels or <a href="International_Baccalaureate" title="wikilink">International Baccalaureate</a> diplomas. For example, Peterhouse requires 1 and 2 or better in STEP as well as A grades at A-levels including A-level Mathematics and Further Mathematics in order to be considered for entry for the Mathematical Tripos. Between one-half and two-thirds of those who apply with the required grades are given offers of a place.</p>
<p>Public debate in the United Kingdom continues over whether admissions processes at Oxford and Cambridge are entirely merit based and fair; whether enough students from <a href="state_schools" title="wikilink">state schools</a> are encouraged to apply to Cambridge; and whether these students succeed in gaining entry. Almost half of all successful applicants come from independent schools. However, the average qualifications for successful applicants from state schools are slightly lower than the average qualification of successful applicants from private schools . Critics have argued that the lack of state school applicants with the required grades applying to Cambridge and Oxford has had a negative impact on Oxbridge&lt;U+2019&gt;s reputation for many years, and the University has encouraged pupils from state schools to apply for Cambridge to help redress the imbalance. Others counter that government pressure to increase state school admissions constitutes inappropriate <a href="social_engineering_(political_science)" title="wikilink">social engineering</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Graduate admission is first decided by the faculty or department relating to the applicant&lt;U+2019&gt;s subject. This effectively guarantees admission to a college - though not necessarily the applicant&lt;U+2019&gt;s preferred choice.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="sport-and-other-extracurricular-activities">Sport and other extracurricular activities</h2>
<p>Cambridge maintains a long tradition of student participation in sport and recreation. <a href="Rowing_(sport)" title="wikilink">Rowing</a> is a particularly popular sport at Cambridge, and there are competitions between colleges (notably the <a href="bumps_race" title="wikilink">bumps races</a>) and against Oxford (the <a href="Boat_Race" title="wikilink">Boat Race</a>). There are also <a href="Varsity_match" title="wikilink">Varsity matches</a> against Oxford in many other sports, ranging from <a href="rugby_union" title="wikilink">rugby</a> (see <a href="Cambridge_University_RUFC" title="wikilink">Cambridge University RUFC</a>) and <a href="cricket" class="uri" title="wikilink">cricket</a>, to <a href="chess" class="uri" title="wikilink">chess</a> and <a href="tiddlywinks" class="uri" title="wikilink">tiddlywinks</a>. Athletes representing the university in certain sports entitle them to apply for a <a href="Cambridge_Blue" title="wikilink">Cambridge Blue</a> at the discretion of the <em>Blues Committee,</em> consisting of the captains of the thirteen most prestigious sports. There is also the self-described &lt;U+201C&gt;unashamedly elite&lt;U+201D&gt; <a href="Hawks&#39;_Club" title="wikilink">Hawks&lt;U+2019&gt; Club</a> (men only), whose membership is usually restricted to Cambridge Full Blues and Half Blues.</p>
<p>The <a href="Cambridge_Union" title="wikilink">Cambridge Union</a> serves as a focus for debating. Drama societies notably include the <a href="Cambridge_University_Amateur_Dramatic_Club" title="wikilink">Amateur Dramatic Club (ADC)</a> and the comedy club <a href="Footlights" class="uri" title="wikilink">Footlights</a>, which are known for producing well-known showbusiness personalities.

<h2 id="myths-legends-and-traditions">Myths, legends and traditions</h2>
<p><img src="Mathematicians_bridge_cambridge_large.jpg" title="fig:The Mathematical Bridge over the river Cam (at Queens&lt;U+2019&gt; College)" alt="The Mathematical Bridge over the river Cam (at Queens&lt;U+2019&gt; College)" width="250" /> </p>
<p>There are many popular myths associated with the University of Cambridge:</p>
<p>One famous myth relates to <a href="Queens&#39;_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Queens&lt;U+2019&gt; College</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s so-called <a href="Mathematical_Bridge" title="wikilink">Mathematical Bridge</a> (pictured right). Supposedly constructed by Sir Isaac Newton, it reportedly held itself together without any bolts or screws. Legend has it inquisitive students took it apart and were then unable to reassemble it without bolts. However, the bridge was erected 22 years after Newton&lt;U+2019&gt;s death. This myth may have arisen from the fact that earlier versions of the bridge used iron pins and screws at the joints, whereas the current bridge uses more visible nuts and bolts.</p>
<p>Another famous myth involves Clare Bridge, <a href="List_of_bridges_in_Cambridge" title="wikilink">currently the oldest bridge</a>, which is attached to <a href="Clare_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Clare College</a>. Spherical stone ornaments adorn this bridge. One of these has a quarter sphere wedge removed from the back. This is a feature pointed out on almost all tours over the bridge. Various myths are associated with this sphere. See <a href="University_of_Cambridge_legends#Clare_College_bridge" title="wikilink">Cambridge legends</a>.</p>
<p>A discontinued tradition is that of the <a href="wooden_spoon_(award)" title="wikilink">wooden spoon</a>, the &lt;U+2018&gt;prize&lt;U+2019&gt; awarded to the student with the lowest passing grade in the final examinations of the Mathematical Tripos. The last of these spoons was awarded in 1909 to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the Lady Margaret Boat Club of <a href="St_John&#39;s_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">St John&lt;U+2019&gt;s College</a>. It was over one metre in length and had an oar blade for a handle. It can now be seen outside the Senior Combination Room of St John's. Since 1909, results were published alphabetically within class rather than score order. This made it harder to ascertain who the winner of the spoon was (unless there was only one person in the third class), and so the practice was abandoned.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the legend of the <a href="Austin_7" title="wikilink">Austin 7</a> delivery van that ended up on the apex of the Senate House is no myth at all. The <a href="Gonville_and_Caius_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Caius College</a> website recounts in detail how this vehicle &lt;U+201C&gt;went up in the world&lt;U+201D&gt;. <a href="http://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/college/past/legend/index.php">23</a></p>

The first president (<a href="Henry_Dunster" title="wikilink">Henry Dunster</a>), the first benefactor (<a href="John_Harvard_(clergyman)" title="wikilink">John Harvard</a>), and the first schoolmaster (<a href="Nathaniel_Eaton" title="wikilink">Nathaniel Eaton</a>) of Harvard were all Cambridge University alumni, as was the then ruling (and first) governor of the <a href="Massachusetts_Bay_Colony" title="wikilink">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a>, <a href="John_Winthrop" title="wikilink">John Winthrop</a>.

<p>In <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>, there is a Cambridge and Oxford Society,<a href="http://www.camford.org/">25</a> a rare example of the name Cambridge coming before Oxford when the two universities are referred to together &lt;U+2014&gt; traditionally, the order used when referring to both universities is &lt;U+201C&gt;Oxford and Cambridge&lt;U+201D&gt;, the order in which they were founded. The probable reason for this inversion is that the Cambridge Club was founded first in Japan, and it also had more members than its Oxford counterpart when they amalgamated in 1905.</p>
<p>The University&lt;U+2019&gt;s publishing arm, the <a href="Cambridge_University_Press" title="wikilink">Cambridge University Press</a>, is the oldest printer and publisher in the world.</p>
