<p><strong><em>Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies</em></strong> is the 1623 published collection of <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">William Shakespeare</a>'s plays. Modern scholars commonly refer to it as the <strong>First Folio</strong>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Printed in <a href="Folio_(printing)" title="wikilink">folio</a> format and containing 36 plays (see <a href="Shakespeare&#39;s_plays#Canonical_plays" title="wikilink">list of Shakespeare's plays</a>), it was prepared by Shakespeare's colleagues <a href="John_Heminges" title="wikilink">John Heminges</a> and <a href="Henry_Condell" title="wikilink">Henry Condell</a>. It was dedicated to the &quot;incomparable pair of brethren&quot; <a href="William_Herbert,_3rd_Earl_of_Pembroke" title="wikilink">William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke</a> and his brother <a href="Philip_Herbert,_4th_Earl_of_Pembroke" title="wikilink">Philip Herbert</a>, Earl of Montgomery (later 4th Earl of Pembroke).</p>
<p>Although eighteen of Shakespeare's plays had been published in <a href="quarto" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarto</a> prior to 1623, the First Folio is the only reliable text for about twenty of the plays, and a valuable source text even for many of those previously published. The Folio includes all of the plays generally accepted to be Shakespeare's, with the exception of <em><a href="Pericles,_Prince_of_Tyre" title="wikilink">Pericles, Prince of Tyre</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Two_Noble_Kinsmen" title="wikilink">The Two Noble Kinsmen</a></em>, and the two <a href="lost_work" title="wikilink">&quot;lost plays&quot;</a>, <em><a href="The_History_of_Cardenio" title="wikilink">Cardenio</a></em> and <em><a href="Love&#39;s_Labour&#39;s_Won" title="wikilink">Love's Labour's Won</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="printing">Printing</h2>
<p>The contents of the First Folio were compiled by <a href="John_Heminges" title="wikilink">Heminges</a> and <a href="Henry_Condell" title="wikilink">Condell</a>;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> the members of the <a href="Worshipful_Company_of_Stationers_and_Newspaper_Makers" title="wikilink">Stationers Company</a> who published the book were the booksellers <a href="Edward_Blount" title="wikilink">Edward Blount</a> and the father/son team of <a href="William_Jaggard" title="wikilink">William and Isaac Jaggard</a>. The Jaggards were printers as well as booksellers, an unusual but not unprecedented combination. William Jaggard has seemed an odd choice by the <a href="King&#39;s_Men_(playing_company)" title="wikilink">King's Men</a>, since he had published the questionable collection <em><a href="The_Passionate_Pilgrim" title="wikilink">The Passionate Pilgrim</a></em> as Shakespeare's, and in 1619 had printed new editions of ten Shakespearean quartos to which he did not have clear rights, some with false dates and title pages (the <a href="False_Folio" title="wikilink">False Folio</a> affair). Heminges and Condell emphasised that the Folio was replacing the earlier publications, which they characterised as &quot;stol'n and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by frauds and stealths of injurious impostors&quot;, asserting that Shakespeare's true words &quot;are now offer'd to your view cured, and perfect of their limbes; and all the rest, absolute in their numbers as he conceived them.&quot;</p>
<p>The paper industry in England was then in its infancy and the quantity of quality <a href="History_of_paper" title="wikilink">rag paper</a> for the book was imported from France.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> It is thought that the <a href="typesetting" class="uri" title="wikilink">typesetting</a> and printing of the First Folio was such a large job that the King's Men simply needed the capacities of the Jaggards' shop. William Jaggard was old, infirm and blind by 1623, and died a month before the book went on sale; most of the work in the project must have been done by his son Isaac. <img src="Bad_quarto,_good_quarto,_first_folio.png" title="fig:Comparison of the &quot;To be, or not to be&quot; soliloquy in the first three editions of Hamlet, showing the varying quality of the text in the Bad Quarto, the Good Quarto and the First Folio" alt="Comparison of the &quot;To be, or not to be&quot; soliloquy in the first three editions of Hamlet, showing the varying quality of the text in the Bad Quarto, the Good Quarto and the First Folio" width="320" /></p>
<p>The First Folio's publishing syndicate also included two stationers who owned the rights to some of the individual plays that had been previously printed: <a href="William_Aspley" title="wikilink">William Aspley</a> (<em><a href="Much_Ado_About_Nothing" title="wikilink">Much Ado About Nothing</a></em> and <em><a href="Henry_IV,_Part_2" title="wikilink">Henry IV, Part 2</a></em>) and <a href="John_Smethwick" title="wikilink">John Smethwick</a> (<em><a href="Love&#39;s_Labour&#39;s_Lost" title="wikilink">Love's Labour's Lost</a>,</em> <em><a href="Romeo_and_Juliet" title="wikilink">Romeo and Juliet</a>,</em> and <em><a href="Hamlet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hamlet</a></em>). Smethwick had been a business partner of another Jaggard, William's brother John.</p>
<p>The printing of the Folio was probably done between February 1622 and early November 1623.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The printer originally expected to have the book ready early, since it was listed in the <a href="Frankfurt_Book_Fair" title="wikilink">Frankfurt Book Fair</a> catalogue as a book to appear between April and October 1622.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The first impression had a publication date of 1623, and the earliest record of a retail purchase is an account book entry for 5 December 1623 of <a href="Sir_Edward_Dering,_1st_Baronet" title="wikilink">Edward Dering</a> (who purchased two); the <a href="Bodleian_Library" title="wikilink">Bodleian Library</a>, in <a href="University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">Oxford</a>, received its copy in early 1624 (which it subsequently sold for &lt;U+00A3&gt;24 as a superseded edition when the <a href="Folios_and_Quartos_(Shakespeare)" title="wikilink">Third Folio</a> became available in 1664).</p>
<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>
<p>The thirty-six plays of the First Folio occur in the order given below; plays that had never been published before 1623 are marked with an <a href="asterisk" class="uri" title="wikilink">asterisk</a>. Each play is followed by the type of source used, as determined by bibliographical research.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>(Some definitions are needed. The term &quot;<a href="foul_papers" title="wikilink">foul papers</a>&quot; refers to Shakespeare's working drafts of a play; when completed, a transcript or &quot;fair copy&quot; of the foul papers would be prepared, by the author or by a scribe. Such a manuscript would have to be heavily annotated with accurate and detailed stage directions and all the other data needed for performance, and then could serve as a <a href="Prompt_book" title="wikilink">&quot;prompt-book&quot;</a>, to be used by the <a href="Prompt_(theatre)" title="wikilink">prompter</a> to guide a performance of the play. Any of these manuscripts, in any combination, could be used as a source for a printed text. On rare occasions a printed text might be annotated for use as a prompt-book; this may have been the case with <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>. The label Q<em>n</em> denotes the <em>n</em>th quarto edition of a play.)</p>

<p><em>Troilus and Cressida</em> was originally intended to follow <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, but the typesetting was stopped, probably due to a conflict over the rights to the play; it was later inserted as the first of the Tragedies, when the rights question was resolved. It does not appear in the table of contents.</p>
<h2 id="compositors">Compositors</h2>
<p>As far as modern scholarship has been able to determine,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> the First Folio texts were set into type by five compositors, with different spelling habits, peculiarities, and levels of competence. Researchers have labelled them A through E, A being the most accurate, and E an apprentice who had significant difficulties in dealing with manuscript copy. Their shares in typesetting the pages of the Folio break down like this:</p>

<p>Compositor &quot;E&quot; was most likely one John Leason, whose apprenticeship contract dated only from 4 November 1622. One of the other four might have been a John Shakespeare, of <a href="Warwickshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Warwickshire</a>, who apprenticed with Jaggard in 1610&lt;U+2013&gt;17. (&quot;Shakespeare&quot; was a common name in Warwickshire in that era; John was no known relation to the playwright.)</p>
<h2 id="the-first-folio-and-variants">The First Folio and variants</h2>
<p><img src="First_Folio_VA.jpg" title="fig:The First Folio (Victoria and Albert Museum, London)" alt="The First Folio (Victoria and Albert Museum, London)" /> <a href="W._W._Greg" title="wikilink">W. W. Greg</a> has argued that <a href="Edward_Knight_(King&#39;s_Men)" title="wikilink">Edward Knight</a>, the &quot;book-keeper&quot; or &quot;book-holder&quot; (<a href="prompter" class="uri" title="wikilink">prompter</a>) of the <a href="King&#39;s_Men_(playing_company)" title="wikilink">King's Men</a>, did the actual proofreading of the manuscript sources for the First Folio. Knight is known to have been responsible for maintaining and annotating the company's scripts, and making sure that the cuts and changes ordered by the <a href="Master_of_the_Revels" title="wikilink">Master of the Revels</a> were complied with.</p>
<p>Some pages of the First Folio &lt;U+2013&gt; 134 out of the total of 900 &lt;U+2013&gt; were proofread and corrected while the job of printing the book was ongoing. As a result, the Folio differs from modern books in that individual copies vary considerably in their typographical errors. There were about 500 corrections made to the Folio in this way.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> These corrections by the typesetters, however, consisted only of simple typos, clear mistakes in their own work; the evidence suggests that they almost never referred back to their manuscript sources, let alone tried to resolve any problems in those sources. The well-known <a href="crux_(literary)" title="wikilink">cruxes</a> in the First Folio texts were beyond the typesetters' capacity to correct.</p>
<p>The Folio was typeset and bound in &quot;sixes&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; 3 sheets of paper, taken together, were folded into a booklet-like quire or gathering of 6 leaves, 12 pages. Once printed, the &quot;sixes&quot; were assembled and bound together to make the book. The sheets were printed in 2-page formes, meaning that pages 1 and 12 of the first quire were printed simultaneously on one side of one sheet of paper (which became the &quot;outer&quot; side); then pages 2 and 11 were printed on the other side of the same sheet (the &quot;inner&quot; side). The same was done with pages 3 and 10, and 4 and 9, on the second sheet, and pages 5 and 8, and 6 and 7, on the third. Then the first quire could be assembled with its pages in the correct order. The next quire was printed by the same method: pages 13 and 24 on one side of one sheet, etc. This meant that the text being printed had to be &quot;cast off&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; the compositors had to plan before-hand how much text would fit onto each page. If the compositors were setting type from manuscripts (perhaps messy, revised and corrected manuscripts), their calculations would frequently be off by greater or lesser amounts, resulting in the need to expand or compress. A line of verse could be printed as two; or verse could be printed as prose to save space, or lines and passages could even be omitted (a disturbing prospect for those who prize Shakespeare's works).<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="performing-shakespeare-using-the-first-folio">Performing Shakespeare using the First Folio</h2>
<p>Some Shakespeare directors and theatre companies producing Shakespeare believe that while modern editions of Shakespeare's plays, which are heavily edited and changed, are more readable, they remove possible actor cues found in the Folio, such as capitalization, different punctuation and even the changing or removal of whole words. Among the theatre companies that have based their production approach upon use of the First Folio was the <a href="Riverside_Shakespeare_Company" title="wikilink">Riverside Shakespeare Company</a>, which, in the early 1980s, began a studied approach to their stage productions relying upon the First Folio as their textual guide. In the 1990s, the First Folio was reissued in a paperback format more accessible to the general public.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Today, many theatre companies and festivals producing the works of Shakespeare use the First Folio as the basis for their theatrical productions and training programmes, including London's Original Shakespeare Company, a theatre company which works exclusively from cue scripts drawn from the First Folio.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>However, what are now the widely accepted versions of these plays include lines taken from the Quartos, which are not in the First Folio. For instance, small passages of <em>Hamlet</em> are omitted &lt;U+2013&gt; among them Horatio's line &quot;A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye&quot;, and his subsequent speech beginning with &quot;In the most high and palmy state of Rome, / A little ere the mightiest Julius fell...&quot; Also missing is Hamlet's encounter with the Norwegian captain from Fortinbras's army in Act IV, Scene IV, along with perhaps the most important cut, the soliloquy &quot;How all occasions do inform against me&quot;. <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> omits the prologue, with its famous line about &quot;star-crossed lovers&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="holdings-sales-and-valuations">Holdings, sales and valuations</h2>
<p>The First Folio's original price was 1 <a href="pound_sterling" title="wikilink">pound</a>, the equivalent of about &lt;U+00A3&gt;95&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+00A3&gt;110 in 2006.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Like most books of that time the Folio was sold unbound and buyers would spend another pound or two to have it bound in leather, with various embellishments.</p>
<p>It is believed that around 800 copies of the First Folio were printed, of which there are 233 known surviving copies.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The <a href="British_Library" title="wikilink">British Library</a> holds 5 copies. The <a href="Folger_Shakespeare_Library" title="wikilink">Folger Shakespeare Library</a> in Washington, D.C. holds the world's largest collection with 82 copies.

<p>The First Folio is one of the most valuable printed books in the world: a copy sold at <a href="Christie&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christie's</a> in New York in October 2001 made $6.16 million <a href="Auction#Terminology" title="wikilink">hammer price</a> (then &lt;U+00A3&gt;3.73m).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Oriel_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Oriel College, Oxford</a>, raised a conjectured &lt;U+00A3&gt;3.5 million from the sale of its First Folio to <a href="John_Paul_Getty,_Jr." title="wikilink">Sir Paul Getty</a> in 2003.</p>
<p>On 13 July 2006, a complete copy of the First Folio owned by <a href="Dr_Williams&#39;s_Library" title="wikilink">Dr Williams's Library</a> was auctioned at <a href="Sotheby&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sotheby's</a> auction house.
