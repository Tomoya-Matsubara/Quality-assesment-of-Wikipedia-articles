<p>The idea of &lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna continued to endure to a certain extent in post-war Poland, because Polish anti-communists saw the Soviet-backed communist rise to power as the fruition of pre-war anti-Polish agitation; and with it came the implication of Jewish responsibility. The appointment of Jews in positions responsible for oppressing the populace further fueled this perception.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna survives in the post-Soviet era primarily in rhetoric on the political fringe. However, in the minds of others the contentions of some Polish historians regarding Jewish disloyalty to Poland under the Soviets raises the specter of &lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>The concept of a Jewish conspiracy threatening Polish social order dates in print to the pamphlet <em>Rok 3333 czyli sen nies&lt;U+0142&gt;ychany</em> (The Year 3333, or the Incredible Dream) by <a href="Enlightenment_in_Poland" title="wikilink">Polish Enlightenment</a> author and political activist <a href="Julian_Ursyn_Niemcewicz" title="wikilink">Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz</a>, written in 1817 and published posthumously in 1858.

<p>At the end of the 19th century, <a href="Roman_Dmowski" title="wikilink">Roman Dmowski</a>'s <a href="National_Democracy" title="wikilink">National Democratic</a> party characterized Poland's Jews and other opponents of Dmowski's party as internal enemies who were behind international conspiracies inimical to Poland and who were agents of disorder, disruption and socialism.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Historian <a href="Antony_Polonsky" title="wikilink">Antony Polonsky</a> writes that before World War I &quot;The National Democrats brought to Poland a new and dangerous ideological fanaticism, dividing society into 'friends' and 'enemies' and resorting constantly to conspiratorial theories (&quot;Jewish-Masonic plot&quot;; &quot;<em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em>&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;&quot;Jew-communism&quot;) to explain Poland's difficulties.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Meanwhile, Jews played into National Democratic rhetoric by affirming themselves as alien through their participation in exclusively Jewish organizations such as the <a href="General_Jewish_Labour_Bund" title="wikilink">Bund</a> and the <a href="Zionism" title="wikilink">Zionist movement</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="origin">Origin</h2>
<p>The term <em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em> originated in connection with the Russian <a href="Bolshevik_Revolution" title="wikilink">Bolshevik Revolution</a> and became a prominent antisemitic stereotype<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> expressing political paranoia<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and targeting Jewish communists during the <a href="Polish-Soviet_War" title="wikilink">Polish-Soviet War</a>. The <a href="October_Revolution" title="wikilink">Russian revolution</a> and emerging <a href="Soviet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Soviet</a> regime was seen by many Poles as Russian <a href="imperialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">imperialism</a> in a new guise.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The visibility of Jews in both the Soviet leadership and in the <a href="Polish_Communist_Party" title="wikilink">Polish Communist Party</a> further heightened such fears.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> According to <a href="Jaff_Schatz" title="wikilink">Jaff Schatz</a>, the strength of the <em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em> belief stemmed from age-old Polish fears of Russia and from anti-communist and antisemitic attitudes. Schatz writes that &quot;because anti-Semitism was one of the main forces that drew Jews to the Communist movement, &lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna meant turning the effects of anti-Semitism into a cause of its further increase.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> <em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em> boosted antisemitism by amplifying ideas about an alleged &quot;<a href="List_of_conspiracy_theories#Jewish_world_domination" title="wikilink">Jewish world conspiracy</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> According to this thinking, Bolshevism and communism became &quot;the modern means to the long-attempted Jewish political conquest of Poland; the &lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna conspirators would finally succeed in establishing a '<a href="Judeopolonia" title="wikilink">Judeo-Polonia</a>.'&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Accusations of <em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em> accompanied a wave of <a href="anti-Jewish_violence_in_Poland,_1918&lt;U+2013&gt;20" title="wikilink">anti-Jewish violence in Poland during the years 1918-1920</a>, when violence against Jews was legitimized as Polish national self-defense against a people who were oppressors of the Polish nation. Some soldiers and officers in the Polish eastern territories shared the conviction that Jews were enemies of the Polish nation-state and were collaborators with Poland's enemies. Some of these troops treated all Jews as Bolsheviks. This <em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em> paranoia led to violence and killings of Jews in a number of towns, including the <a href="Pinsk_massacre" title="wikilink">Pinsk massacre</a>, in which 35 innocent Jews were murdered, and the <a href="Lw&lt;U+00F3&gt;w_pogrom_(1918)" title="wikilink">Lw&lt;U+00F3&gt;w pogrom</a>, in which 72 Jews were murdered. Occasional instances of Jewish support for Bolshevism during the <a href="Polish-Soviet_War" title="wikilink">Polish-Soviet War</a> served to heighten the stereotype.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The concept of <em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em> was exploited in propaganda by Poland's interwar <a href="endecja" title="wikilink">National Democrats</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Publications of the <a href="Catholic_Church_in_Poland" title="wikilink">Catholic Church in Poland</a> also commonly expressed anti-Jewish views.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Though Jews were well represented in the <a href="Polish_Communist_Party" title="wikilink">Polish Communist Party</a>, Jewish communists were a minuscule political and social group with little actual influence in the Polish-Jewish community or Poland as a whole.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>During <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, the term <em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em> was made to resemble the <em><a href="Judeo-bolshevism" title="wikilink">Jewish-Bolshevism</a></em> rhetoric of <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi Germany</a>, wartime <a href="Romania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romania</a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> and other war-torn countries of <a href="Central_Europe" title="wikilink">Central</a> and <a href="Eastern_Europe" title="wikilink">Eastern Europe</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> A number of historians, such as <a href="Jan_T._Gross" title="wikilink">Jan T.

<p>The National Democrats (<em>Endeks</em>) emerged from the <a href="Polish_legislative_election,_1930" title="wikilink">1930 Polish elections</a> to <a href="Sejm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sejm</a> as the main opposition party to the <a href="J&lt;U+00F3&gt;zef_Pi&lt;U+0142&gt;sudski" title="wikilink">Pi&lt;U+0142&gt;sudski</a> government. Pi&lt;U+0142&gt;sudski had a liberal attitude towards minorities, and was respected by much of the Polish Jewish minority.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In the midst of the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a> and in a climate of widespread nationalist and antisemitic sentiment, the Endeks launched an anti-Jewish campaign aimed at exploiting dissatisfaction with the government at a time of economic crisis. The anti-Jewish agitation included calls for reducing the numbers of Jews in the country and an economic boycott (launched in 1931), leading to outbreaks of violence against Jews, particularly at universities. Following the death of Pi&lt;U+0142&gt;sudski in 1935, the Endeks moved towards seizing power in Poland, and began to exploit the &quot;Jewish question&quot; in full. The Endeks and other parties on the right employed the old <em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em> stereotype alongside a new slogan, <em>Folksfront</em>, both signifying an alleged alliance between Jews and communists.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> While there was a limited audience for <em>Endek</em> propaganda, it was supplemented by the much larger circulation enjoyed by Catholic Church publications, which increasingly referred to the communist threat and the alleged &quot;Godlessness&quot; of the Jews. One antisemitic Church newspaper alone, the <em>Samoobrona Narodu</em> (&quot;Self-Defense of the Nation,&quot; which meant defense against Jews), had a circulation of over one million.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>In the period between the two world wars, the <em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em> myth grew concurrently in Poland with the myth of the &quot;criminal Jew.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Statistics from the 1920s had indicated a Jewish crime rate that was well below the percentage of Jews in the population. However, a subsequent reclassification of how crime was recorded&lt;U+2014&gt;which now included minor offenses&lt;U+2014&gt;succeeded in reversing the trend, and Jewish criminal statistics showed an increase relative to the Jewish population by the 1930s. These statistics were used by the Polish antisemitic press to propagate an image of the &quot;criminal Jew;&quot; additionally, political crimes by Jews were magnified, creating a perception of a criminal <em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Another important factor was the perceived dominance of Jews in the leadership of the <a href="Communist_Party_of_Poland" title="wikilink">Communist Party of Poland</a> (<em>KPP</em>). As noted by historian <a href="Joseph_Marcus" title="wikilink">Joseph Marcus</a>, the KPP should not be considered a &quot;Jewish party,&quot; as it was in fact in opposition to traditional Jewish economic and national interests.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The Jews supporting KPP saw themselves as international communists and rejected much of the Jewish culture and tradition.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Nonetheless, the KPP, along with the <a href="Polish_Socialist_Party" title="wikilink">Polish Socialist Party</a>, was notable for its decisive stand against anti-semitism.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Notably, the party had strong Jewish representation at higher levels. Out of fifteen leaders of the <em>KPP</em> central administration in 1936, eight were Jews. Jews constituted 53% of the &quot;active members&quot; of the <em>KPP</em>, 75% of its &quot;publication apparatus,&quot; 90% of the &quot;international department for help to revolutionaries&quot; and 100% of the &quot;technical apparatus&quot; of the Home Secretariat. In Polish court proceedings against communists between 1927 and 1936, 90% of the accused were Jews. In terms of membership, before its dissolution in 1938, 25% of <em>KPP</em> members were Jews; most urban <em>KPP</em> members were Jews&lt;U+2014&gt;a substantial number, given an 8.7% Jewish minority in <a href="Second_Polish_Republic" title="wikilink">prewar Poland</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Jaff Schatz's summary of Jewish participation in the prewar Polish communist movement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Throughout the whole interwar period, Jews constituted a very important segment of the Communist movement. According to Polish sources and to Western estimates, the proportion of Jews in the KPP [the Communist Party of Poland] was never lower than 22 percent. In the larger cities, the percentage of Jews in the KPP often exceeded 50 percent and in smaller cities, frequently over 60 percent. Given this background, a respondent's statement that &quot;in small cities like ours, almost all Communists were Jews,&quot; does not appear to be a gross exaggeration.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Research on voting patterns in Poland's parliamentary elections in the 1920s has shown that Jewish support for the communists was proportionally less than their representation in the total population.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Support for Poland's communist and pro-Soviet parties came largely from Ukrainian and <a href="Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Orthodox</a> Belarusian voters.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Schatz notes that even if post-war claims by Jewish communists that 40% of the 266,528 communist votes on several lists of front organizations at the <a href="Polish_legislative_election,_1928" title="wikilink">1928 Sejm election</a> came from the Jewish community were true (a claim Marcus describes as &quot;almost certainly an exaggeration&quot;),<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> this would amount to no more than 5% of Jewish votes for the communists, indicating the Jewish population at large was &quot;far from sympathetic to communism.&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> In the end, while most Jews were neither communists nor communist sympathizers, a substantial and quite visible portion of the Polish Communist leadership in the interwar period were Jews. However, research by Jeffrey Koppstein and Jason Wittenberg, who analyzed the communist vote in interwar Poland, has shown that the notion of the &quot;communist Jew&quot; was a myth at the mass level. The authors note that not only were most communists not Jews, but most Jews were not communists, and in fact &quot;Jews were no more communist than the Catholic Poles, and far less so than the Belarusans or Ukrainians.&quot;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Nonetheless it was the disproportionately large representation of Jews in the communist leadership led to the <em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em> myth being widely used in the propaganda of the Endeks.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

<p>After the <a href="German_invasion_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">German invasion of the Soviet Union</a> in 1941, belief in the <em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em> stereotype, combined with the German Nazi encouragement for expression of anti-Semitic attitudes, was a principal cause of massacres of Jews by gentile Poles in Poland's northeastern <a href="&lt;U+0141&gt;om&lt;U+017C&gt;a" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+0141&gt;om&lt;U+017C&gt;a</a> province in the summer of 1941, including the massacre at <a href="Jedwabne_pogrom" title="wikilink">Jedwabne</a>.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>

<p>The Soviet-backed communist government was as harsh towards non-communist Jewish cultural, political and social life as they were towards Polish.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Thousands of Jews returned from exile in Soviet Union; among them were a small number of Jewish communists who played a minor, but highly visible, role in the unpopular communist government and its security apparatus.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> The new government's hostility to the wartime Polish exile government and resistance&lt;U+2014&gt;which it accused of being nationalist, reactionary and antisemitic&lt;U+2014&gt;further strengthened the myth of <em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em>, to the point where in the popular consciousness Jewish Bolshevism was seen as having conquered Poland.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> It was in this context, reinforced by the immediate post-war lawlessness, that Poland experienced an unprecedented wave of <a href="Anti-Jewish_violence_in_Poland,_1944-1946" title="wikilink">anti-Jewish violence</a> (of which most notable was the <a href="Kielce_pogrom" title="wikilink">Kielce pogrom</a>).<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>The Polish-American historian <a href="Marek_Jan_Chodakiewicz" title="wikilink">Marek Jan Chodakiewicz</a> stressed that after the <a href="History_of_Poland_(1945-1989)" title="wikilink">Soviet takeover of Poland</a> in 1945 violence had developed amid postwar retribution and counter-retribution, exacerbated by the breakdown of law and order and a <a href="cursed_soldiers" title="wikilink">Polish anti-Communist insurgency</a>.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> According to Chodakiewicz, some Jewish &quot;avengers&quot; endeavored to extract justice from the Poles who harmed Jews during the War and in some cases Jews attempted to reclaim property confiscated by the Nazis. These phenomena further reinforced the stereotype of <em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em>, a Jewish-Communist conspiracy in post-war Poland. Chodakiewicz noted that after World War Two, the Jews were not only victims, but also aggressors. He describes cases in which Jews cooperated with the Polish secret police, denouncing Poles and members of the <a href="Home_Army" title="wikilink">Home Army</a>. Chodakiewicz noted that some 3500 to 6500 Poles died in late 1940s because of Jewish denunciations or were killed by Jews themselves.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>Regarding this period, <a href="Andre_Gerrits" title="wikilink">Andre Gerrits</a> writes, in his study of the myth, that though communism was now a reality in Poland,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vigor of antisemitism during the first post-war decade cannot be exclusively attributed to the prominent role of individuals of Jewish extraction in the newly-established Communist regimes. Various factors played a role&lt;U+2014&gt;from the continuation of traditional anti-Jewish sentiments (ethnically or religiously inspired) to the overall radicalizing effect of the war and the fear that the Jews who returned from camps, exile or hiding would reclaim their [property].<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The combination of the effects of the Holocaust and postwar antisemitism led to a dramatic mass emigration of Polish Jewry in the immediate postwar years. Of the estimated 240,000 Jews in Poland in 1946, only 90,000 remained a year later.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The surviving Jews of Poland found themselves victims of the explosive postwar political situation. The image of the Jew as a threatening outsider took on a new form as antisemitism was now linked to the imposition of communist rule in Poland, and rumors of massive collaboration of Jews with the unpopular new regime and the Soviet Union. Of the fewer than 80,000 Jews who remained in Poland, many had political reasons for doing so; according to one historian, &quot;their group profile ever more closely resembled the mythic &lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna.&quot;<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a><a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="s">1950s</h2>
<p>During <a href="Stalinism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stalinism</a>, the preferred Soviet policy was to keep sensitive posts in the hands of non-Poles. As a result &quot;all or nearly all of the directors (of the widely despised <a href="Ministry_of_Public_Security_of_Poland" title="wikilink">Ministry of Public Security of Poland</a>) were Jewish&quot; as noted by Polish journalist <a href="Teresa_Tora&lt;U+0144&gt;ska" title="wikilink">Teresa Tora&lt;U+0144&gt;ska</a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> among others.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> A recent study by the Polish <a href="Institute_of_National_Remembrance" title="wikilink">Institute of National Remembrance</a> showed that out of 450 people in director positions in the <a href="Ministry_of_Public_Security_of_Poland" title="wikilink">Ministry</a> between 1944 and 1954, 167 (37.1%) were of Jewish ethnicity, while Jews made up approximately 1% of the post-war Polish population.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>These Jewish members of the security forces would become useful as <a href="scapegoat" title="wikilink">scapegoats</a> in the period of de-Stalinization. According to one account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While Poland&lt;U+2019&gt;s communists had been highly selective in their choice of Jewish scapegoats after Stalin&lt;U+2019&gt;s death, if only because other Jews in the party and security apparatus could not be excluded from participating in the whole process, and the desire of the leadership to keep a tight grip on the scope of the ensuing investigations, there is further evidence to suggest that Poland&lt;U+2019&gt;s communists had grown accustomed to placing the burden of their own failures to gain sufficient legitimacy among the Polish population during the entire communist period on the shoulders of Jews in the party.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>

The categorization of the security forces as a Jewish institution, as disseminated in the post-war anti-communist press at various times, is biased and rooted in a belief in <em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em>.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a><a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Krzysztof Szwagrzyk has quoted <a href="Jan_T._Gross" title="wikilink">Jan T.

<p>The <em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em> myth and scapegoating of Jews reappeared at times of severe political and socioeconomic crises in Stalinist Poland. After the death of <a href="Polish_United_Workers&#39;_Party" title="wikilink">Polish United Workers' Party</a> leader <a href="Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw_Bierut" title="wikilink">Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Bierut</a> in 1956, a <a href="Polish_October" title="wikilink">de-Stalinization</a> and a subsequent battle among rival factions looked to lay blame for the excesses of the Stalin era. As described in one historical account, the party hardline <a href="Natolin_faction" title="wikilink">&quot;Natolin&quot; faction</a> &quot;once again used anti-Semitism as a political weapon and found an echo both in the party <em>apparat</em> and in society at large, where traditional stereotypes of an insidious Jewish cobweb of political influence and economic gain resurfaced, but now in the context of 'Judeo-communism,' the &lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna.&quot;<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> &quot;Natolin&quot; leader <a href="Zenon_Nowak" title="wikilink">Zenon Nowak</a> entered the concept of &quot;Judeo-Stalinization&quot; and placed the blame for the party's failures, errors and repression on &quot;the Jewish <a href="apparatchik" title="wikilink">apparatchiks</a>.&quot; Documents from this period chronicle antisemitic attitudes within Polish society, including beatings of Jews, loss of employment, and persecution. These outbursts of antisemitic sentiment from both Polish society and within the rank and file of the ruling party spurred the exodus of some 40,000 Polish Jews between 1956 and 1958.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a><a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="section">1968</h2>

<p>Perversely, the old stereotype of &lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna was even reignited by Polish state propaganda during the anti-semitic <a href="1968_Polish_political_crisis" title="wikilink">1968 March crisis</a>. As historian Dariusz Stola notes, the anti-Jewish campaign combined century-old conspiracy theories, recycled anti-semitic claims and classic communist propaganda. Regarding the tailoring of the <em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em> myth to communist Poland, Stola writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Paradoxically, probably the most powerful slogan of the communist propaganda in March was the accusation that the Jews were zealous communists. They were blamed for a major part, if not all, of the crimes and horrors of the Stalinist period. The myth of Judeo-bolshevism had been well known in Poland since the Russian revolution and the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920, yet its 1968 model deserves interest as a tool of communist propaganda. This accusation exploited and developed the popular stereotype of Jewish communism to purify communism: the Jews were the dark side of communism; what was wrong in communism was due to them.&quot;<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="present">1989–present</h2>
<p>Post-communist Poland experienced what has been described as a sudden, intense and widespread outburst of anti-Jewish mood, including allegations that Jews were to blame for Poland's &quot;decline&quot; during the communist years, and Jew-baiting of political opponents during election campaigns. More recent efforts have emerged from a wide range of sources in the Polish community to challenge these conceptions of Jews and to foster a pluralistic society in Poland.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p>The expression <em>&lt;U+017B&gt;ydokomuna</em> is now used almost exclusively by fringe nationalists, usually in reference to former communist party members and to &quot;liberals&quot; who have supported capitalist reforms, <a href="globalization" class="uri" title="wikilink">globalization</a> and <a href="European_integration" title="wikilink">European integration</a>.
