<p>The list of <strong>Virginia Tech bowl games</strong> played since the creation of the <a href="Virginia_Tech_football" title="wikilink">Virginia Tech Hokies football</a> team in 1892 consists of 21 post-season <a href="bowl_game" title="wikilink">bowl games</a>. Included in those 21 games are three <a href="Bowl_Championship_Series" title="wikilink">Bowl Championship Series</a> game appearances and one appearance in the <a href="BCS_National_Championship_Game" title="wikilink">national championship game</a>. The Hokies have been invited to a bowl game every year since 1993, a 15-year streak that is surpassed only by Michigan (33 games), Florida State (26 games), and Florida (17 games) for active teams.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Including historical streaks, Virginia Tech is tied for eighth with <a href="Ole_Miss_Rebels_football" title="wikilink">Mississippi</a> and <a href="Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football" title="wikilink">Ohio State</a>, who had bowl game streaks during the periods 1957-1971 and 1972-1986, respectively.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Dozens of <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a> <a href="NFL_draft" title="wikilink">draft picks</a> have played for Virginia Tech in bowl games, including two <a href="List_of_National_Football_League_first_overall_draft_choices" title="wikilink">first-overall selections</a>: <a href="Bruce_Smith" title="wikilink">Bruce Smith</a> and <a href="Michael_Vick" title="wikilink">Michael Vick</a>. Smith participated in the <a href="1984_Independence_Bowl" title="wikilink">1984 Independence Bowl</a>, while Vick <a href="quarterback" title="wikilink">quarterbacked</a> the Hokies to their first national championship appearance during the <a href="2000_Sugar_Bowl" title="wikilink">2000 Sugar Bowl</a>, and followed that performance by leading the Hokies to the <a href="2001_Gator_Bowl" title="wikilink">2001 Gator Bowl</a>, his final collegiate game.

<p>Since 1987, the Virginia Tech football team has been led by head coach <a href="Frank_Beamer" title="wikilink">Frank Beamer</a>. Since 1993, Beamer has led the Hokies to 15 consecutive bowl games, going 6–9 during that period. Beamer has earned <a href="Paul_&quot;Bear&quot;_Bryant_Award" title="wikilink">national coach of the year</a> honors several times from various organizations, and has the third-most wins of any active <a href="Division_I" title="wikilink">Division I</a> college football coach.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Virginia Tech's first post-season bowl game was in 1947, when the Hokies participated in the <a href="1947_Sun_Bowl" title="wikilink">1947 Sun Bowl</a> in <a href="El_Paso,_Texas" title="wikilink">El Paso, Texas</a> on <a href="New_Year&#39;s_Day" title="wikilink">New Year's Day</a> against the <a href="Cincinnati_Bearcats_football" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Bearcats</a>.

<h2 id="sun-bowl">1947 Sun Bowl</h2>


<p>The first bowl game in Virginia Tech history came at the conclusion of the 1946 college football season as the Hokies earned a bid to the 1947 <a href="Sun_Bowl" title="wikilink">Sun Bowl</a>. The Hokies, led by coach <a href="James_Kitts" title="wikilink">James Kitts</a>, finished the regular season with three losses, three wins, and three ties (3–3–3). The team also recorded Virginia Tech's first win over an <a href="AP_Poll" title="wikilink">Associated Press</a> Top 25 team in school history,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> the <a href="Washington_and_Lee_University" title="wikilink">Washington and Lee University</a> Generals, and the Hokies' traditional rivals, the <a href="Virginia_Military_Institute" title="wikilink">Virginia Military Institute</a> Keydets.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Despite those victories, Tech's bid to the Sun Bowl only came about because the bowl's first and second picks had declined the bid and because an influential Tech alumnus on the selection committee had suggested Virginia Tech.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Opposing the Hokies were the <a href="Cincinnati_Bearcats_football" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Bearcats</a>, who had gone 8–2 during the regular season.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The game <a href="Kickoff_(American_football)" title="wikilink">kicked off</a> on <a href="January_1" title="wikilink">January 1</a>, <a href="1947" class="uri" title="wikilink">1947</a> at at <a href="Kidd_Field" title="wikilink">Kidd Field</a> in <a href="El_Paso,_Texas" title="wikilink">El Paso, Texas</a> in freezing temperatures.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Defense dominated on both sides in the first half due to the weather and tough play. Neither team scored, but Virginia Tech had the best chance&lt;U+2014&gt;driving to a <a href="Down_(American_football)" title="wikilink">first down</a> inside the Cincinnati two-yard line in the first quarter. The Cincinnati defense held, however, and the game went into <a href="halftime" class="uri" title="wikilink">halftime</a> scoreless.</p>
<p>In the second half, the favored Bearcats managed to find success on offense. Behind <a href="All-American" class="uri" title="wikilink">All-American</a> Roger Stephens, the Bearcats tallied three <a href="touchdown" title="wikilink">touchdowns</a> to Virginia Tech's one.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The Hokies managed to block all three Cincinnati <a href="extra_point" title="wikilink">extra point</a> kicks, but without touchdowns of their own, the Hokies had no chance to win. Cincinnati emerged victorious as time ran out, 18–6.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="liberty-bowl">1966 Liberty Bowl</h2>


<p>Virginia Tech's second bowl game did not come until nearly 20 years after its first. On <a href="December_10" title="wikilink">December 10</a>, <a href="1966" class="uri" title="wikilink">1966</a>, the Hokies faced off against the No. 9 <a href="Miami_Hurricanes_football" title="wikilink">Miami Hurricanes</a> in the <a href="Liberty_Bowl" title="wikilink">Liberty Bowl</a> in <a href="Memphis,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Memphis</a>, <a href="Tennessee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tennessee</a>. Tech came into the game having gone 8–1–1 during <a href="1966_college_football_season" title="wikilink">the regular season</a> under head coach <a href="Jerry_Claiborne" title="wikilink">Jerry Claiborne</a>,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> while the Hurricanes boasted a 7–2–1 regular-season record, including wins over <a href="USC_Trojans_football" title="wikilink">Southern California</a> and <a href="Florida_Gators_football" title="wikilink">Florida</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The Hokies were led by <a href="All-America" class="uri" title="wikilink">All-America</a> <a href="Safety_(American_football)" title="wikilink">safety</a> <a href="Frank_Loria" title="wikilink">Frank Loria</a>, who caught three <a href="interception" title="wikilink">interceptions</a> and <a href="punt_return" title="wikilink">returned</a> three <a href="punt" title="wikilink">punts</a> for touchdowns as a <a href="junior" class="uri" title="wikilink">junior</a> during the 1966 season.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> On the opposite side of the ball, the Hurricanes were led by All-American Ted Hendricks.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The game kicked off in frigid  weather,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and from the beginning, defense dominated. In the first half, Tech held Miami to just 16 yards of <a href="total_offense" title="wikilink">total offense</a>,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and Miami set bowl game records for fewest rushing yards allowed and fewest first downs allowed.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The Hokies got the first big break of the game after blocking Miami's first punt of the game. Taking over at the Miami 21-yard line, it took Virginia Tech just five plays to march into the <a href="end_zone" title="wikilink">end zone</a> for an early 7–0 lead.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Virginia Tech and Miami battled to a stalemate for the rest of the first half, and Tech went into <a href="halftime" class="uri" title="wikilink">halftime</a> still clinging to a 7–0 lead.</p>
<p>In the second half, Tech's fortune turned. Late in the third quarter, the Virginia Tech defense stopped Miami's offense for yet another time, but instead of receiving the punt cleanly, the Hokies committed a <a href="American_football_rules#Fouls_against_the_defense" title="wikilink">roughing the kicker penalty</a> that allowed Miami to retain possession of the ball with a first down. A few plays later, Miami scored its first touchdown of the game. In the fourth quarter Miami finally took the lead on a 10-play, 70-yard drive.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The Hokies were unable to answer the Hurricanes' score, and Miami won the 1966 Liberty Bowl, 14–7.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="liberty-bowl-1">1968 Liberty Bowl</h2>


<p>Two years after its previous trip to the Liberty Bowl, Virginia Tech was again asked to travel to <a href="Memphis,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Memphis</a>, <a href="Tennessee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tennessee</a> to play in a post-season bowl game. This time, the opponent was <a href="Ole_Miss_Rebels_football" title="wikilink">Mississippi</a>, which had amassed a 6–3–1 record during the regular season.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The Hokies came into the game with a 7–3 record that included a loss to Tech's previous Liberty Bowl opponent, Miami.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1968 Liberty Bowl kicked off on <a href="January_14" title="wikilink">January 14</a>, <a href="1968" class="uri" title="wikilink">1968</a>. As in the Hokies' previous Liberty Bowl appearance, Virginia Tech got off to a fast start. On the game's second play, Tech ran 58 yards for a touchdown, courtesy of a trick play. After Mississippi fumbled, Tech recovered and scored another quick touchdown. At the end of the first quarter, Tech added a field goal to the two touchdowns it had already earned, making the score 17–0 at the end of one quarter. From that point onward, however, almost nothing would go in Virginia Tech's favor. Tech attempted an <a href="onside_kick" title="wikilink">onside kick</a> following the field goal, but were unable to successfully recover the ball. With good field position following the kick, Mississippi quarterback <a href="Archie_Manning" title="wikilink">Archie Manning</a> orchestrated a 49-yard drive for the Rebels' first points of the game.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Mississippi scored another touchdown before halftime, and the Hokies clung to a 17–14 lead at the beginning of the second half. That three-point lead quickly evaporated, however, as 21 seconds into the third quarter, Mississippi's Steve Hindman ran for 79 yards and a touchdown to give Mississippi a 21–17 lead.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Ole Miss added 13 more points before the game was over and earned the victory, 34–17.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The Virginia Tech offense was stymied by repeated turnovers. Tech <a href="fumble" title="wikilink">fumbled</a> the ball three times and Tech quarterback Humphries threw two interceptions.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Tech committed 120 yards in penalties and was held to just two passing yards for the entire game.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="peach-bowl">1981 Peach Bowl</h2>


<p>Following the <a href="1980_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season" title="wikilink">1980 college football season</a>, Virginia Tech was awarded a bid to the 1981 <a href="Peach_Bowl" title="wikilink">Peach Bowl</a> as a reward for finishing 8–3 during the regular season.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Facing Virginia Tech was a familiar post-season opponent&lt;U+2014&gt;Miami&lt;U+2014&gt;whom the Hokies had played in the 1966 Liberty Bowl. No. 20 Miami finished the regular season with an 8–3 record.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1981 Peach Bowl kicked off on <a href="January_2" title="wikilink">January 2</a>, <a href="1981" class="uri" title="wikilink">1981</a> at <a href="Fulton_County_Stadium" title="wikilink">Fulton County Stadium</a> in <a href="Atlanta,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Atlanta</a>, <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>. Unlike the 1966 Liberty Bowl, in which Virginia Tech scored first, it was Miami who dominated the game's early going. The Hurricanes scored a touchdown on the first drive of the game and tacked on another touchdown early in the second quarter. Tech was held scoreless in the early going, thanks to two Miami interceptions at the <a href="goal_line" title="wikilink">goal line</a> as Virginia Tech was threatening to score. Late in the second quarter, Tech was finally able to get on the scoreboard with a field goal, but at halftime, the Miami Hurricanes led 14–3.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>After halftime, the Hokies threatened Miami for the first time all game. Virginia Tech mounted an 80-yard drive that resulted in a touchdown, cutting Miami's lead to 14–10. But the Hurricanes' defense clamped down on any further offensive attempts by Virginia Tech and denied the Hokies more points. Miami added two field goals: one in the third quarter and one in the fourth quarter that finally put the game out of reach for Virginia Tech.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Miami earned the win, 20–10. Miami's win was its first bowl victory since the 1966 Liberty Bowl, which also featured a Hurricanes victory over Virginia Tech.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="independence-bowl">1984 Independence Bowl</h2>


<p>The Virginia Tech Hokies earned a bid to the 1984 <a href="Independence_Bowl" title="wikilink">Independence Bowl</a> following an 8–3 record during the <a href="1984_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season" title="wikilink">1984-1985 football season</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Facing the Hokies were the <a href="Air_Force_Falcons_football" title="wikilink">Falcons</a> of the <a href="United_States_Air_Force_Academy" title="wikilink">United States Air Force Academy</a>, who had gone 7–4 during the regular season, including a 5–3 record in the <a href="Western_Athletic_Conference" title="wikilink">Western Athletic Conference</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1984 Independence Bowl kicked off on <a href="December_15" title="wikilink">December 15</a>, <a href="1984" class="uri" title="wikilink">1984</a> in <a href="Shreveport,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Shreveport</a>, <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a>. Weather at kickoff was a comfortable  and the wind was from the southwest at &lt;U+2013&gt;. An estimated 41,100 people came out to watch the Falcons take on the Hokies.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Air Force scored first with a 35-yard field goal, but the Hokies struck back with a touchdown off of a 10-play, 72-yard drive, putting Virginia Tech ahead 7–3. That score would remain until halfway through the second quarter, when Virginia Tech <a href="fumble" title="wikilink">fumbled</a> the ball at its own three-yard line. Air Force recovered the ball and scored a touchdown on the next play, regaining a 10–7 lead.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>At halftime, Air Force still led by 10–7. Following the half, Virginia Tech's defense began to break down under Air Force's <a href="Rush_(American_football)" title="wikilink">rushing</a> offense. The Hokies and Air Force battled defensively throughout the third quarter, but in the fourth quarter, Air Force's offense broke free for 13 unanswered points.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Tech's offense was stifled by two Air Force interceptions and two lost fumbles, allowing Air Force to earn the easy victory, 23–7.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="peach-bowl-1">1986 Peach Bowl</h2>


<p>Virginia Tech's first bowl win in school history came in a dramatic 25–24 win over the No. 18 <a href="North_Carolina_State_Wolfpack_football" title="wikilink">North Carolina State Wolfpack</a> in the 1986 Peach Bowl. Tech came into the game with a 9–1–1 record that included an unusual forfeit win over <a href="Temple_Owls" title="wikilink">Temple</a>. The Owls, who had played the game with an ineligible player, won the game on the field, but later forfeited the victory to Virginia Tech.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Facing the Hokies in the 1986 Peach Bowl were the 18th-ranked Wolfpack from <a href="North_Carolina_State_University" title="wikilink">North Carolina State University</a>.

<p>The 1986 Peach Bowl kicked off on <a href="December_31" title="wikilink">December 31</a>, <a href="1986" class="uri" title="wikilink">1986</a> at Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> five years minus one day since Virginia Tech had last played in Atlanta for the 1981 Peach Bowl. Virginia Tech scored first, but NC State's Bulluck blocked a Tech punt in the Tech end zone and recovered it for a tying touchdown. Virginia Tech kicked a field goal at the end of the quarter to take a 10–7 lead, but NC State fought back, scoring 14 unanswered points in the second quarter to take a 21–10 lead by halftime.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>In the third quarter, the game turned into a defensive battle. Neither side scored until late in the third quarter, when Tech took advantage of a State fumble to score the first touchdown of the second half. Tech failed to convert a two-point conversion, but NC State fumbled again on the ensuing possession, and Tech was able to drive for another touchdown. Leading 22–21, Tech attempted another two-point conversion, which also failed.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>NC State, needing to score, drove down the field and kicked a go-ahead 33-yard field goal with 7:12 remaining in the game. After a failed possession, Tech was forced to ball away, allowing NC State to run down the clock. The Virginia Tech defense eventually forced a stop, giving the Tech offense one final chance to win the game. With 1:53 on the clock and beginning from their own 20-yard line, the Hokies drove 57 yards to the NC State 23-yard line. There, kicker Craig Kinzer successfully kicked a 40-yard field goal as time expired to give Virginia Tech a 25–24 win.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="independence-bowl-1">1993 Independence Bowl</h2>


<p>The No. 22 Virginia Tech Hokies came into the 1993 Independence Bowl with a 8–3 regular-season record that included wins over Pittsburgh and Virginia.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The bowl appearance was the first for head coach <a href="Frank_Beamer" title="wikilink">Frank Beamer</a>, who had turned the team around after a 2–8–1 season the previous year.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Facing the Hokies were the No. 21 Indiana Hoosiers, who were playing in their first bowl game since the 1991 <a href="Copper_Bowl" title="wikilink">Copper Bowl</a>.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

Indiana climbed back with two field goals that cut Tech's lead to 14–13. With Indiana in possession of the ball and time running down, it appeared that Indiana would have at least one more attempt on offense before halftime. Before the Indiana drive could get moving, John Paci <a href="fumble" title="wikilink">fumbled</a> the ball, which was recovered by Virginia Tech and returned 20 yards for a touchdown.

<p>The Hokies struggled back in the third quarter, scoring six unanswered points to close the score to 35–16.

<p>In 1995, Virginia Tech received its first bid to a <a href="Bowl_Coalition" title="wikilink">Bowl Coalition</a> game. The Bowl Coalition, predecessor to the modern <a href="Bowl_Championship_Series" title="wikilink">Bowl Championship Series</a>, was intended to match up the two best teams in the <a href="Sugar_Bowl" title="wikilink">Sugar</a>, <a href="Orange_Bowl_(game)" title="wikilink">Orange</a>, <a href="Fiesta_Bowl" title="wikilink">Fiesta</a>, and <a href="Rose_Bowl" title="wikilink">Rose Bowls</a>, with the two highest-ranked teams playing in a <a href="NCAA_Division_I-A_national_football_championship" title="wikilink">National Championship Game</a>.

Defense dominated in the first quarter as neither team scored during the game's first four possessions. Late in the quarter, however, Texas' offense, led by quarterback James Brown, put together an eight-play, 72-yard drive that ended with a four-yard <a href="touchdown" class="uri" title="wikilink">touchdown</a> <a href="forward_pass" title="wikilink">pass</a>. At the end of the first quarter, Texas led 7–0.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Early in the second quarter, Texas added another three points with a 52-yard field goal that came off of an interception.

The Hokies' 7–0 lead at the end of the first quarter didn't last long, however. Nebraska scored a field goal early in the second quarter and tacked on a touchdown to take a 10–7 lead halfway through the second quarter. Then Nebraska got its biggest play of the game as Tech's Druckenmiller <a href="fumble" title="wikilink">fumbled</a> the ball. A Nebraska player scooped up the ball, returning it 31 yards for a touchdown.

<p>Nebraska widened its lead with a 33-yard touchdown run six minutes into the second half, but Tech answered right back with a 33-yard touchdown pass on its subsequent possession. The score cut Nebraska's lead to 24–21. Unfortunately for the Hokies, that score was the closest they would get to a lead as Nebraska's offense began to wear down the Tech defense.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Nebraska scored another touchdown in the fourth quarter, then racked up 10 points in the fourth quarter to secure the victory.

The Hokies scored the only points of a third quarter as <a href="running_back" title="wikilink">running back</a> <a href="Lee_Suggs" title="wikilink">Lee Suggs</a> ran into the <a href="end_zone" title="wikilink">end zone</a> from one yard out, allowing Tech to take a 17–10 lead into the fourth quarter. The Falcons didn't give up easily, however. Air Force kicker Joey Ashcroft cut into the Tech lead with a 21-yard field goal. Tech matched the score later in the quarter to restore the one-touchdown lead. As time ran down, Air Force had one final chance to tie the game and send it into <a href="overtime" class="uri" title="wikilink">overtime</a>. Beginning at its own 18-yard line with 4:11 left to play, the Falcons drove deep into Tech territory.

<p>During the latter half of the <a href="2003_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season" title="wikilink">2003 college football season</a>, Virginia Tech struggled. Following an 8–4 regular season, that saw the Hokies lose four of its last six regular-season games, Tech accepted a bid to the 2003 <a href="Insight_Bowl" title="wikilink">Insight Bowl</a>.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Facing the Hokies were the <a href="California_Golden_Bears_football" title="wikilink">California Golden Bears</a>, who had gone 7–6 during the regular season, tying for third place in the <a href="Pacific_10" title="wikilink">Pacific 10</a>.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p>The 2003 Insight Bowl kicked off on <a href="December_26" title="wikilink">December 26</a>, <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a> at <a href="Bank_One_Ballpark" title="wikilink">Bank One Ballpark</a> in <a href="Phoenix,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Phoenix</a>, <a href="Arizona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arizona</a>. From the beginning, it was a quick-paced, high-scoring game. In the first quarter, Virginia Tech jumped out to a 21–7 lead courtesy of the Tech passing game, which saw quarterback <a href="Bryan_Randall" title="wikilink">Bryan Randall</a> eventually throw four touchdowns. In the second quarter, California partially recovered from its 14-point first-quarter deficit by scoring two touchdowns. Tech, meanwhile, scored another, and took a 28–21 lead into halftime.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>The offensive onslaught continued in the second half, though it was California that took the advantage at first. Bolstered by an improved defensive effort that held the Hokies scoreless throughout the third quarter, California, behind quarterback <a href="Aaron_Rodgers" title="wikilink">Aaron Rodgers</a>, scored 21 unanswered points to take a 42–28 lead into the fourth quarter. But in that quarter, the Hokies clawed back into competition. Tech scored a touchdown to begin the quarter, but Cal answered right back with one of its own, making the score 49–35. The Hokies then evened the score at 49–49 after an 80-yard drive that took less than two minutes and a punt return by DeAngelo Hall for a touchdown.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> With time running out, Cal still had a chance to drive for a game-winning score. The post-score Tech kickoff went out of bounds, giving the Bears possession at their 35-yard line. Cal needed just seven plays to march 47 yards to set up the game-winning field goal. As time expired, kicker Tyler Frederickson kicked a 35-yard field goal try to give California the 52–49 win.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>

<p>A decade after Virginia Tech's selection the 1995 Sugar Bowl and five years after its appearance in a Sugar Bowl game that served as the national championship game, Tech was again selected to play in New Orleans' annual Sugar Bowl game. The No. 9 Hokies finished the regular season 10–2 and won the <a href="Atlantic_Coast_Conference" title="wikilink">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> championship their first year in the conference, winning an automatic bid to the game.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Facing the Hokies were the No. 3 <a href="Auburn_Tigers_football_team" title="wikilink">Auburn Tigers</a>, who had gone 12–0 during the regular season.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Normally, Auburn's undefeated season would have been justification for a spot in the <a href="2005_BCS_National_Championship_Game" title="wikilink">2005 BCS National Championship Game</a>, but because two other teams had also gone undefeated during the regular season, Auburn, as the No. 3 team in the country, was left out of the National Championship game.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Superdome_Sunset.jpg" title="fig:The Louisiana Superdome was the site of the 2005 Sugar Bowl" alt="The Louisiana Superdome was the site of the 2005 Sugar Bowl" width="200" /> The 2005 Sugar Bowl kicked off at the <a href="Louisiana_Superdome" title="wikilink">Louisiana Superdome</a> in <a href="New_Orleans,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a>, <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a> on <a href="January_3" title="wikilink">January 3</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>. The game's early going was marked by defense and field goals. Virginia Tech didn't score in the first half, and Auburn managed just three field goals, including one taken inside the Virginia Tech <a href="red_zone" title="wikilink">red zone</a> after Auburn failed to score a touchdown from the Tech one-yard line. Tech also had a chance to score a touchdown from inside their opponent's one-yard line, but like Auburn, failed to do so. The Hokies elected to try for a touchdown rather than a field goal on <a href="Down_(American_football)" title="wikilink">fourth down</a>, but were stopped. At halftime, Auburn had a 9–0 lead.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<p>In the second half, both teams had more offensive success. Auburn scored the game's first touchdown four and a half minutes into the third quarter, widening the Tigers' lead to 16–0. Virginia Tech fought back, driving inside the Auburn 10-yard line before settling for a field goal attempt. Kicker Brandon Pace missed the 23-yard field goal try, leaving the score at 16–0. Tech would have other chances, however. With less than seven minutes remaining in the game, Tech scored its first points of the game after a six-play, 78-yard drive. A 29-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Bryan Randall made the score 16–6 after a missed <a href="two-point_conversion" title="wikilink">two-point conversion</a>. As time ran down, Tech closed the gap even further. With just over two minutes remaining in the game, Randall connected on an 80-yard pass to wide receiver Josh Morgan for a touchdown. With the score now at 16–13 and time running out, Tech elected to attempt an <a href="onside_kick" title="wikilink">onside kick</a> in hopes of having a chance for a game-winning offensive drive. Auburn recovered the kick, however, and ran out the clock.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p>Auburn won the game, 16–13, and Auburn quarterback Jason Campbell was named the game's most valuable player.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
