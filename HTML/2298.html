There were as many as 62 different buildings in 3FSHQ. Construction of a more fortified headquarters near the base of a hill at Stuart in Townsville commenced in <a href="1942" class="uri" title="wikilink">1942</a>. It is on the side of a hill near Mount Stuart, on the west side of the road to Charters Towers. It can still be seen today on the hill on the opposite side of the Stuart Shopping centre (Wulguru).</p>
<p>This site finally became fully operational on <a href="20_December" title="wikilink">20 December</a> <a href="1944" class="uri" title="wikilink">1944</a>. The main operations building was made of 12 inch (30 cm) thick re-inforced concrete designed to withstand a direct bomb hit. It had a mezzanine floor and was air-conditioned.</p>
<p>There were other fortifications in Townsville and the rest of Australia that were also air-conditioned such as the <a href="Green_St._Bunker,_West_End" title="wikilink">Green Street bunker</a> at West End in Townsville and the Ramsay Street bunker at Garbutt in Townsville. <img src="3fs01.jpg" title="fig:|Aerial view of 3 FSHQ Stuart/Wulguru circa 1942" alt="|Aerial view of 3 FSHQ Stuart/Wulguru circa 1942" width="250" /> 3 Fighter Sector Headquarters comprised 32 rooms in the large rectangular concrete building with caneite partitions forming various passageways. The building still stands today and is 60 ft X 42 ft. The mezzanine floor has long since disappeared.</p>
<p>The role of the Fighter Sector Headquarters was to co-ordinate all of the intelligence information from the various D/F stations and VAOC posts, decide on the most appropriate response and then advise the appropriate fighter or bomber squadrons to respond. 3FSHQ was in telephone and radio contact with all of the anti-aircraft, searchlight, RDF and HF/DF stations in the Townsville area.</p>
<p>All air raid warnings were initiated from this bunker by red, yellow and white flares.</p>
<p>103 FCU was disbanded in Townsville on <a href="21_January" title="wikilink">21 January</a> <a href="1945" class="uri" title="wikilink">1945</a>.</p>
<p>Modern day use of the site has apparently been hindered by the presence of old tunnels that were in use during WW2.</p>
<p>There was also HQ located in <a href="North_Ward,_Queensland" title="wikilink">North Ward, Townsville</a>.</p>
