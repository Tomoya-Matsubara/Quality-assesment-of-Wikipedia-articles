<p>Until the year 1940, the &lt;U+2018&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;Archaeological Museum of Preveza &lt;U+2013&gt; Nikopolis&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt; was located in an Ottoman <a href="mosque" class="uri" title="wikilink">mosque</a>, in the city of <a href="Preveza,_Greece" title="wikilink">Preveza, Greece</a>. In the year 1940, the mosque was bombed by Italian aircraft and was partially destroyed. Some of the exhibits were stolen. After the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, the mosque was demolished by the Greek state. In the year 1965 the state built a small Archaeological <a href="Museum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Museum</a> inside the Byzantine walls of ancient Nikopolis. From 1998 to 2006 a new archaeological museum was built 5Â km North of Preveza,but it will not open until 2010.</p>
