<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The University of South Carolina began efforts to open a school of commerce as early as <a href="1914" class="uri" title="wikilink">1914</a>. USC founded the school in <a href="1919" class="uri" title="wikilink">1919</a> and dean George Olson firmly established the school by the early <a href="1920s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1920s</a>. The school grew with the university. In <a href="1958" class="uri" title="wikilink">1958</a>, the school established the <a href="MBA" title="wikilink">Masters of Business Administration</a> program. By 1963, <a href="AACSB" class="uri" title="wikilink">AACSB</a> gave the school full accreditation.</p>
<p><img src="MooreDarla.jpg" title="fig:Darla Moore has donated $70 million to the school and the Moore School of Business is named in her honor." alt="Darla Moore has donated $70 million to the school and the Moore School of Business is named in her honor." width="125" /> The Professional Masters of Business Administration (PMBA, but then called MBA-ETV) started in <a href="1970" class="uri" title="wikilink">1970</a>. The PMBA program allows people in South Carolina to receive an MBA by taking part-time classes at remote locations and over the internet. Then in <a href="1974" class="uri" title="wikilink">1974</a> the school established its Masters of International Business (MIBS). National publications hold the program in high esteem and the program continuously garners high rankings in international business.</p>
<p>In <a href="1998" class="uri" title="wikilink">1998</a>, <a href="Wall_Street" title="wikilink">Wall Street</a> financier and USC graduate <a href="Darla_Moore" title="wikilink">Darla Moore</a> donated $25 million to the business school. In her honor the school was renamed Darla Moore School of Business. The first name was dropped shortly thereafter and the school is now officially called The Moore School of Business.</p>
<p>In <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a> <a href="Joel_A._Smith_III" title="wikilink">Joel A. Smith III</a>, a former <a href="Bank_of_America" title="wikilink">Bank of America</a> Executive was appointed to be the <a href="dean_(education)" title="wikilink">dean</a> of the Moore School.</p>
<p>The school combined its MIBS and MBA programs to form the IMBA program in <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a>. The same year, the school started offering a specialization in international business for undergraduate students as a major.</p>
<p>On <a href="April_23" title="wikilink">April 23</a>, <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a> the Business School announced another gift by Darla Moore. She donated $45 million with the challenge to the University to match that sum. The funds are dedicated to a complete renovation of the Hipp-Close building and to increase the school's endowment.</p>

<p>The International Masters of Administration at the Moore School combines traditional business education with intensive language training in one of eight languages &lt;U+2013&gt; <a href="Arabic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arabic</a>, <a href="Chinese_language" title="wikilink">Chinese</a>, <a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French</a>, <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German</a>, <a href="Italian_language" title="wikilink">Italian</a>, <a href="Japanese_language" title="wikilink">Japanese</a>, <a href="Portuguese_language" title="wikilink">Portuguese</a>, or <a href="Spanish_language" title="wikilink">Spanish</a>. In addition to the language tracks, the global track allows students to study the business and cultural issues of regions around the world without learning a language other than <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a>. All tracks are 20-22 months, with the exception of Chinese and Japanese, which require 29-34 months of study to give students added exposure to the more complex languages and cultures of these countries.</p>
<p>Students begin the program with an intensive core of business courses. The core last from July to December. In January, students begin language training in the country that natively speaks the language they are learning. Then around May 1, students begin a mandatory internship, usually in the language they studied.</p>
<p>After their internships are completed, students in both the language and global tracks return to the Moore School of Business to continue their business education. Students take elective classes during their final two semesters either at USC or they may choose to complete a one-semester exchange.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
