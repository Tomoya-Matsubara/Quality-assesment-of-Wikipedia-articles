Palmer &amp; Co.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In 1868, after bowing out of involvement in day to day operations with his new partners of Field, Palmer &amp; Leiter, <a href="Potter_Palmer" title="wikilink">Potter Palmer</a> convinced <a href="Marshall_Field" title="wikilink">Marshall Field</a> and <a href="Levi_Leiter" title="wikilink">Levi Leiter</a> to move the Field, Leiter &amp; Co. store to a building Palmer owned on State Street at the corner of Washington Street.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> After being consumed by the <a href="Great_Chicago_Fire" title="wikilink">Great Chicago Fire</a> and splitting the wholesale business from the retail operations, the store resumed operations at State and Washington in a building leased from the <a href="Singer_Sewing_Machine_Company" title="wikilink">Singer Sewing Machine Company</a>. This building was consumed in another fire in 1877, and when a new Singer Building was built to replace it at the same location in 1879, Field purchased it. The business has remained there ever since, and it has added four subsequent buildings to form the integrated structure that is now called the Marshall Field and Company Building.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Chicago's retailing center was State Street in the downtown <a href="Chicago_Loop" title="wikilink">Loop</a> after the <a href="Great_Chicago_Fire" title="wikilink">Great Chicago Fire</a> of 1871, and this center has been anchored by <a href="Marshall_Field&#39;s" title="wikilink">Marshall Field's</a> and its predecessor companies in this building.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> However, commuter suburbs began to have significant retail districts by the 1920s.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> After 1950, suburban development and the <a href="Magnificent_Mile" title="wikilink">Magnificent Mile</a> reduced the role of the Loop's daily significance to many Chicagoans as downtown retail sales slipped.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Nonetheless, the Marshall Field and Company Building has survived at this location.</p>

<p>The store housed a business that established new retailing standards and broke with many business conventions of the day. Before Marshall Field's death in 1906, his company became the largest wholesale and retail dry goods enterprise in the world.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The Marshall Field&lt;U+2019&gt;s &amp; Company offered the first <a href="bridal_registry" title="wikilink">bridal registry</a>, provided the first in-store dining facilities and established the first <a href="European" class="uri" title="wikilink">European</a> buying office. In the early 1900&lt;U+2019&gt;s, annual sales topped $60 million and buying branches were located in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a>, <a href="Tokyo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tokyo</a>, <a href="Stockholm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stockholm</a> and <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

Marshall Field envisioned the clock as a beacon for his store which he viewed as a meeting place. The clock was installed after the southwest corner of the store had became a popular meeting place and people began leaving notes for one another on the Marshall Field's windows. The clock was an attempt to end this practice, and encourage punctuality.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
