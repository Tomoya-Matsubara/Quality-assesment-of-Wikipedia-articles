<p><strong>Maya textiles</strong> are the clothing and other <a href="indigenous_textile_arts_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">textile arts</a> of the <a href="Maya_people" title="wikilink">Maya people</a>, <a href="indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">indigenous peoples</a> of the <a href="Yucatan_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Yucatan Peninsula</a> in <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>, <a href="Guatamala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guatamala</a>, <a href="Honduras" class="uri" title="wikilink">Honduras</a>, <a href="El_Salvador" title="wikilink">El Salvador</a>, and <a href="Belize" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belize</a>. Women have traditionally created textiles in Mayan society, and textiles were a significant form of <a href="Mayan_art" title="wikilink">Mayan art</a> and <a href="Mayan_religion" title="wikilink">religious beliefs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<p>In woven textiles, the first step is preparing fiber, which can come from plants, such as <a href="cotton" class="uri" title="wikilink">cotton</a> or <a href="maguey" class="uri" title="wikilink">maguey</a>, or animals, such as <a href="wool" class="uri" title="wikilink">wool</a> from sheep. The loose fibers are spun into threads by hand, with <a href="Spindle_(textiles)" title="wikilink">spindles</a>, a long stick-like device for holding the thread, and <a href="whorl" title="wikilink">whorls</a>, a weight held on the spindle to increase its motion.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In the <a href="precolumbian_era" title="wikilink">precolumbian era</a>, Mayan women exclusively wove with <a href="loom#Back_strap_loom" title="wikilink">backstrap looms</a>, that use sticks and straps worn around one's waist to create tension. After European contact, <a href="treadle" class="uri" title="wikilink">treadle</a> looms were introduced, although backstrap looms continue to be popular.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Bone picks were used before contact and were unique in that they had different designs for most families and were usually passed on from generation to generation with the elite having the most expensive and beautiful.</p>
<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>
<p>In ancient Maya women had two natural types of cotton to work with, one white and the other light brown, both of which were commonly dyed. The preparation of cotton for spinning was very burdensome, as it had to be washed and picked clean of seeds.</p>
<p>Elite women were also given the opportunity to work with the most expensive <a href="dyes" class="uri" title="wikilink">dyes</a>, feathers, and pearl beads. However, women of the elite not only had to prepare the best clothing for their families they also had to be talented in weaving <a href="tapestry" class="uri" title="wikilink">tapestry</a>, brocade, <a href="embroidery" class="uri" title="wikilink">embroidery</a>, and tie-dyeing for <a href="tribute" class="uri" title="wikilink">tribute</a> to other families and rulers. Weavers had three different <a href="natural_dye" title="wikilink">natural dyes</a> to work with, <a href="indigo" class="uri" title="wikilink">indigo</a> which supplied different shades of blue. <a href="Cochineal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cochineal</a>, an insect that when crushed and dried makes the color red, and a coastal <a href="mollusk" class="uri" title="wikilink">mollusk</a> which they used to whiten cloth by extracting fluid from its glands. Women also worked with <a href="maguey" class="uri" title="wikilink">maguey</a>, which is a variety of fibers taken from an <a href="agaves" class="uri" title="wikilink">agaves</a> plant. Maguey was of major value as a cordage material used for horse gear, nets, <a href="hammocks" class="uri" title="wikilink">hammocks</a>, and bags.</p>
<h2 id="huipil">Huipil</h2>
<p>The most prevalent and influential aspect of women&lt;U+2019&gt;s clothing in ancient Maya is the <a href="huipil" class="uri" title="wikilink">huipil</a>, which is still prominent in <a href="Guatemala" title="wikilink">Guatemalan</a> and <a href="Mexican_culture" title="wikilink">Mexican culture</a> today. The huipil is a loose rectangular garment with a hole in the middle for the head made from lightweight sheer cotton. The huipil is usually white with colorful cross-stripping and zigzag designs woven into the cloth using the <a href="brocade" class="uri" title="wikilink">brocade</a> technique still commonly used today. The huipil could be worn loose or tucked into a skirt; this depends on the varying lengths of the huipil. Huipils were important displaying one&lt;U+2019&gt;s religion and tribal affiliation. Different communities tended to have different designs, colors, lengths as well as particular huipils for ceremonial purposes. It was uncommon and often disgraceful to wear a huipil design from another community within one&lt;U+2019&gt;s village; although, it was a sign of respect to wear a community&lt;U+2019&gt;s huipil when visiting another village. Although, women were not just limited to their community&lt;U+2019&gt;s design. Instead the design offered an outline for what women were required to have and within the community design women were allowed creativity to make theirs different from others often to express praise to different kiuggkes animals around the collar.</p>
<h2 id="hair-sash">Hair sash</h2>
<p><img src="JacaltecBrocade.jpg" title="fig: Detail of hair sash being brocaded on a Jakaltek Maya backstrap loom." alt=" Detail of hair sash being brocaded on a Jakaltek Maya backstrap loom." /> The hair sash is often the only part of the traditional outfit that is still locally woven by women on a backstrap loom. Each ethnic group not only has their own way of wearing the hair sash interlaced or wrapped around their long hair, but colors, motifs, widths, and the manner of setting up the loom and incorporating the geometric and figurative designs into the cloth are distinct. Elaborate hair sashes woven of finer thread with more complex imagery are worn on special occasions.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="ideological-aspects">Ideological aspects</h2>
<p>The Maya believed that clothing could transform a person and a person could transform the garment and is expressed through it, so naturally clothing was of great cultural significance. They would often make textiles to enhance religious power; the most common way of doing this was dressing for the maize gods. Women and men would wear a net overskirt made of <a href="jade" class="uri" title="wikilink">jade</a>, the color of life, which represented their high place in society. In order to dress as a maize deity and manipulate the regeneration of the maize plant they would weave serpents onto huipils to symbolize lightning. The lightning god is the god believed to have created maize on the top of Mt. Sustenance. Mayan elite would also wear a shark shell belt and a jade-netted collar to the maize deity costume. Other significant costumes consisted of wearing many <a href="quetzal" class="uri" title="wikilink">quetzal</a> and eagle feathers on headdresses to represent and elite&lt;U+2019&gt;s power in blue and green tones, which represented the fifth direction, the center of celestial, terrestrial and the underworld levels of the cosmos. Kings would also wear <a href="jaguar" class="uri" title="wikilink">jaguar</a> skin skirts, which signified their connection between the sky and the earth.</p>
