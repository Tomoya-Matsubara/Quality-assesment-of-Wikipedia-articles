<p><strong>Route 19</strong> is a <a href="state_highway" title="wikilink">state highway</a> in <a href="Passaic_County,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Passaic County</a>, <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a>, <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. Also referred to as the <strong>Paterson Peripheral</strong>, it runs  from an intersection with <a href="County_Route_509_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">County Route 509</a> (Broad Street) and County Route 609 (Colfax Avenue) in <a href="Clifton,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Clifton</a> north to another intersection with County Route 509 (Main Street) in downtown <a href="Paterson,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Paterson</a>. Berween <a href="U.S._Route_46" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 46</a> in Clifton and <a href="Interstate_80_in_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Interstate 80</a> in Paterson, Route 19 is a <a href="freeway" class="uri" title="wikilink">freeway</a>. The main purpose of the route is to connect the <a href="Garden_State_Parkway" title="wikilink">Garden State Parkway</a> to I-80 and downtown Paterson. The road was originally proposed as the Paterson spur of the Garden State Parkway that was to run north to <a href="Wayne,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Wayne</a>. In 1959, it was planned to become part of the Paterson Peripheral, an extension of <a href="New_Jersey_Route_20" title="wikilink">Route 20</a> from downtown Paterson. By 1971, the road was completed between the Garden State Parkway and I-80, at which time it received the Route 20 designation; the rest was cancelled in 1978 due to feared community disruption. In 1988, this portion of Route 20 became Route 19 as it did not connect with the other segment of the route. In the 1990s, Route 19 was extended to Main Street in downtown Paterson as part of a project that also completed the interchange with I-80.</p>

In 1988, this portion of Route 20 was redesignated Route 19 as it did not connect with the mainline of the route. In 1992, a project to complete the interchange with I-80 and extend the route to Main Street in downtown Paterson to ease congestion was finished at a cost of $27 million.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> This interchange received the Prize Bridge Award in the category of Grade Separation from Modern Steel Construction magazine in 1996.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
