<p>The <strong>Ireland cricket team</strong> is the <a href="cricket" class="uri" title="wikilink">cricket</a> team representing <a href="Ireland" title="wikilink">all Ireland</a> (i.e. both the <a href="Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Republic of Ireland</a> and <a href="Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland</a>). Due to political difficulties, the Irish Cricket Union was not elected to the <a href="International_Cricket_Council" title="wikilink">International Cricket Council</a> until <a href="1993" class="uri" title="wikilink">1993</a>, and qualified for the <a href="Cricket_World_Cup" title="wikilink">World Cup</a> for the first time in <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>. However, cricket has been played in Ireland since at least the 1880s <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> - including a tour of <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a> in 1888. Their first match with <a href="First-class_cricket" title="wikilink">first-class</a> status was played in <a href="1902" class="uri" title="wikilink">1902</a> against a London County side including <a href="W.G._Grace" title="wikilink">W.G. Grace</a>. The Irish won convincingly, by <a href="The_result_in_cricket" title="wikilink">238 runs</a>.</p>
<p>Ireland's greatest cricketing success to date was in the <a href="2007_Cricket_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2007 Cricket World Cup</a>, where they achieved a <a href="tie_(draw)" title="wikilink">tie</a> against <a href="Zimbabwe_national_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Zimbabwe</a> and victories over <a href="Pakistan_national_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a> and <a href="Bangladesh_national_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Bangladesh</a>, and ended the tournament ranked 10th overall in the official ICC rankings <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> above <a href="Zimbabwe_national_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Zimbabwe</a> and <a href="Kenyan_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Kenya</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>After the 1902 tour of England, where four matches yielded one win, two draws and one loss, the Irish didn't play first-class cricket again for five years (although London County visited again in 1903 and drew. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>). The Irish were soundly beaten on home soil, by <a href="Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Yorkshire</a> and <a href="South_African_cricket_team" title="wikilink">South Africa</a>, suggesting that there was still quite a gap in class.</p>
<p>The Irish played yearly first-class games with the <a href="Scottish_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Scots</a> with regularity, only interrupted by wars, up until <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a>, but all their other cricket was dictated by whenever touring international sides would find it convenient to visit Ireland. However, they often surprised <a href="Test_cricket" title="wikilink">Test</a> nations in these games, winning by 60 runs in a 3-day game in <a href="Dublin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dublin</a> over the <a href="West_Indian_cricket_team" title="wikilink">West Indies</a> in <a href="1928" class="uri" title="wikilink">1928</a>, for example. They did, in fact, take a liking to the West Indies - their arguably finest cricketing moment came in <a href="1969" class="uri" title="wikilink">1969</a>, when they defeated a West Indian side including <a href="Clive_Lloyd" title="wikilink">Clive Lloyd</a> and <a href="Clyde_Walcott" title="wikilink">Clyde Walcott</a> (who admittedly was 43 at the time) by nine wickets, after bowling them out for 25. The match was played at Sion Mills in <a href="County_Tyrone" title="wikilink">County Tyrone</a>.</p>
<p>The Scots and the Irish were mostly competing with <a href="Sri_Lankan_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Sri Lanka</a> for the title as best non-Test nation at the time - indeed, Ireland drew with Sri Lanka in a rain-hit first-class match in <a href="1979" class="uri" title="wikilink">1979</a>, Ireland scoring a total of 341 for seven wickets in two innings while Sri Lanka made 288 for six wickets in one innings. However, the <a href="International_Cricket_Council" title="wikilink">ICC</a> refused to include them until <a href="1993" class="uri" title="wikilink">1993</a>, and the following year they competed in the <a href="ICC_Trophy" title="wikilink">ICC Trophy</a>. However, their good players of the 1960s and 1970s were gone by now, and they lost four of seven games to finish seventh in the tournament.</p>
<p>Four years later in <a href="Malaysia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malaysia</a>, they squeezed through to the semi-finals after a good showing in the group stage, but lost by seven runs to <a href="Kenyan_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Kenya</a> after <a href="Justin_Benson" title="wikilink">Justin Benson</a>, who had played <a href="county_cricket" title="wikilink">county cricket</a> for <a href="Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Leicestershire</a>, had slowed down proceedings with an 85-ball 35. As Ireland needed 216 <a href="run_(cricket)" title="wikilink">runs</a> from 50 <a href="over" title="wikilink">overs</a> (300 balls) to win, that left the other batsmen to hit very, very quickly, and that was not possible. To compound their misery, they lost the third place play-off with <a href="Scottish_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>, thus missing a place at the <a href="1999_cricket_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1999 cricket World Cup</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a> tournament in <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a> showed the batting skills of <a href="Ed_Joyce" title="wikilink">Ed Joyce</a>, who ended up with <a href="Batting_average#Batting_average_in_cricket" title="wikilink">a batting average</a> of 71.80 in eight innings, including four fifties. Joyce, who had been signed by <a href="Middlesex_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Middlesex</a> two years earlier, could not save the team from a number of defeats, however. They lost to the <a href="United_States_cricket_team" title="wikilink">USA</a> by six wickets in the first match in Canada, and also lost to <a href="Danish_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Denmark</a> by 12 runs. In the end, the Irish lost five matches, finishing seventh in the tournament. This was possibly Ireland's lowest point in cricketing history.</p>
<p>The <a href="2005_ICC_Trophy" title="wikilink">2005 ICC Trophy</a>, which was hosted in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland - the group stages in <a href="Belfast" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belfast</a>, <a href="Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland</a>, the final stages in <a href="Dublin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dublin</a>, <a href="Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Republic of Ireland</a> - has seen the Irish improve drastically, however. Ed Joyce's four years in <a href="county_cricket" title="wikilink">county cricket</a>, where he earlier in <a href="2005_English_cricket_season" title="wikilink">2005</a> became the first batsman to hit 1,000 runs, gave him the experience to lift the Irish to big totals (he <a href="Batting_average#Batting_average_in_cricket" title="wikilink">averaged</a> 106 in four innings for the Irish), and even when he left for <a href="County_Championship" title="wikilink">County Championship</a> games with <a href="Middlesex_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Middlesex</a>, they managed to win, taking a four-wicket thriller over <a href="Canadian_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Canada</a> thanks to <a href="Peter_Gillespie" title="wikilink">Peter Gillespie</a>, who hit a career highest score in the ICC Trophy with 64 not out - his first fifty - to anchor their chase to 239. Earlier, South African-born <a href="Andre_Botha_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Andre Botha</a> had taken four <a href="wicket#dismissing_a_batsman" title="wikilink">wickets</a> for 47 runs against. Indeed, their <a href="bowling" class="uri" title="wikilink">bowling</a> was often the key in this tournament, but former <a href="Essex_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Essex</a> player <a href="Adrian_McCoubrey" title="wikilink">Adrian McCoubrey</a> was in fact one of the least penetrative. However, that bowling let them down in the final against <a href="Scottish_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>, as they conceded a total of 324 for 9 after electing to bowl first. The return of <a href="Ed_Joyce" title="wikilink">Joyce</a> did not help them, as he made 81, but the Irish still lost the match by 47 runs. Joyce later that year qualified to play for <a href="English_Cricket_Team" title="wikilink">England</a>, leaving the Irish cricket team. He is still hailed as one of the best players ever produced by Ireland.</p>
<p>Ireland have had a busy period in their build up to the World Cup. From April, they took part in a newly expanded <a href="C&amp;G_Trophy" title="wikilink">C&amp;G Trophy</a>, playing nine English county sides. For this tournament, they were bolstered by the signings of <a href="Saqlain_Mushtaq" title="wikilink">Saqlain Mushtaq</a> and <a href="Shahid_Afridi" title="wikilink">Shahid Afridi</a>, the two overseas players they are allowed when competing in English domestic competitions. Ireland recorded one win (at <a href="The_County_Ground,_Bristol" title="wikilink">Bristol</a> against <a href="Gloucestershire_Gladiators" title="wikilink">Gloucestershire</a>)in their 9 matches, though they lost the remainder.</p>
<p>In May, they started their defence of the Intercontinental Cup, with a five-wicket win against Namibia (who beat Nepal) at Clontarf 17-20 May, 2006. This was followed by a drawn game against Scotland in August.</p>
<p>Ireland's first official <a href="One-day_International" title="wikilink">One-day International</a> was played in Belfast (at Northern Ireland Civil Service Cricket Club, <a href="Stormont" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stormont</a>) against <a href="English_cricket_team" title="wikilink">England</a> on <a href="13_June" title="wikilink">13 June</a> <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>. It was the first time Ireland have played the full England side. Tickets sold well for the game, with a full house of 7,500 attendees.</p>
<p><a href="Marcus_Trescothick" title="wikilink">Marcus Trescothick</a> scored a century as England, scoring 301 for 7 from their 50 overs, overcame a gritty and proud Irish team who made 263 for 9 from their allotment, including 52 from <a href="Andre_Botha_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Andre Botha</a> in his first full One-day International. Two months later, Ireland recorded their first ODI win, beating fellow Associates <a href="Scottish_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Scotland</a> by 85 runs after <a href="Eoin_Morgan" title="wikilink">Eoin Morgan</a> made 99. Ireland also received a valuable 5-figure sum from <a href="Vodafone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vodafone</a>, who sponsored the game. <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The game was televised live on <a href="BBC_Two_Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">BBC Two Northern Ireland</a>.</p>
<p>August saw them participate in Division One of the European Championship, against <a href="Danish_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Denmark</a>, <a href="Italian_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, <a href="Dutch_cricket_team" title="wikilink">The Netherlands</a> and <a href="Scottish_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>. The games against The Netherlands and Scotland had ODI status. They won this tournament, and the Irish teams won the European Championships at every single age level, from Under 13s upwards.</p>

<h4 id="matches-before-the-world-cup">Matches before the World Cup</h4>
<p>January 2007 saw the start of more than 3 months of almost constant cricket. First was a visit to Kenya, where they took part in <a href="2007_ICC_World_Cricket_League_Division_One" title="wikilink">Division One</a> of the <a href="ICC_World_Cricket_League" title="wikilink">ICC World Cricket League</a>. They then traveled to the <a href="United_Arab_Emirates" title="wikilink">United Arab Emirates</a>, where they played an Intercontinental Cup game against the UAE at Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>In the final 13-a-side warm-up matches before the World Cup, Ireland lost to <a href="South_African_cricket_team" title="wikilink">South Africa</a>, but only by 35 runs; and beat <a href="Canadian_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Canada</a> comfortably by 7 wickets.</p>
<h4 id="the-world-cup">The World Cup</h4>
<p>Ireland had an excellent World Cup debut in the <a href="2007_Cricket_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2007 tournament</a>. Their first game was on <a href="March_15" title="wikilink">March 15</a> when they tied with <a href="Zimbabwean_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Zimbabwe</a>, primarily thanks to Ireland's first ever World Cup century by <a href="Jeremy_Bray_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Jeremy Bray</a> and economical bowling in the final overs by <a href="Trent_Johnston" title="wikilink">Trent Johnston</a> and <a href="Andre_Botha_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Andre Botha</a>; the Zimbabweans were dismissed for 221 off the last ball of the innings (<a href="Ed_Rainsford" title="wikilink">Ed Rainsford</a> run out) with the scores level.</p>
<p>In their second match, played on <a href="Saint_Patrick&#39;s_Day" title="wikilink">Saint Patrick's Day</a>, they beat the fourth-ranked team in the world, <a href="Pakistani_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a>, by three wickets, thus knocking Pakistan out of the competition. The result is regarded as one of the biggest shocks in international cricket history.</p>
<p>These two results were sufficient to advance Ireland to the &quot;Super 8&quot; stage of the tournament. Their final group stage game was against <a href="West_Indies_cricket_team" title="wikilink">the West Indies</a>, where they lost by eight wickets.</p>
<p>In the Super 8 stage, they lost their first four matches against England, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, but then recorded a 74-run victory against the 9th ranked team in the world and Test playing nation <a href="Bangladesh_national_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Bangladesh</a>.</p>
<p>As this was their second win against a full ICC member, Ireland have gained 'promotion' by way of recognition in the ICC's official one-day rankings <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>. This list now consists of the ten full members, Kenya and Ireland. Ireland were defeated in their final Super-8 match agianst <a href="Sri_Lanka_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Sri Lanka</a>, by 8 wickets, with 40 overs remaining.</p>
<p>The Irish team received a heroes welcome on <a href="April_24" title="wikilink">April 24</a> <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a> in <a href="Dublin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dublin</a> after a highly successful World Cup campaign.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="after-the-world-cup">After the World Cup</h4>
<p>After the World Cup, Ireland will play in the English domestic one-day <a href="Friends_Provident_Trophy" title="wikilink">Friends Provident Trophy</a> against nine English county sides throughout May and June, and in July will play two triangular series, one against the <a href="Dutch_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Netherlands</a> and the West Indies, the other against the Netherlands and <a href="Scottish_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>. This will be followed by the inaugural <a href="European_Twenty20_Championship" title="wikilink">European Twenty20 Championship</a>.</p>
<p>In May 2007 they will will play in the final of the <a href="ICC_Intercontinental_Cup" title="wikilink">ICC Intercontinental Cup</a> against Canada. This competition represents the next level after Test Match status for non-Test international teams, and Ireland are the reigning champions. Regardless of the result of the match with Canada, in August 2007 Ireland will play Scotland and the Netherlands in the First Round of next year's competition.</p>
<p>In addition, India have agreed to play South Africa in a series of One Day Internationals in Ireland in the summer of 2007, as a result of a 'neutral venue' contract for such matches between BCCI and the Indian broadcaster <a href="Zee_TV" title="wikilink">Zee TV</a>. In addition to lucrative staging rights, it has been confirmed that Ireland will play a one off match at Stormont match against both teams. Thus Ireland will play at least three and possibly four ODIs against test nations, and at least 6 and possibly 8 ODIs in total this summer.</p>
