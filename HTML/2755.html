<p>The <strong>Australian Magpie</strong> (<em>Cracticus tibicen</em>) is a medium-sized black and white <a href="passerine" class="uri" title="wikilink">passerine</a> bird native to Australia and southern New Guinea. A member of the <a href="Artamidae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Artamidae</a>, it is closely related to the <a href="butcherbird" title="wikilink">butcherbirds</a>. At one stage, the Australian Magpie was considered to be three separate species, although zones of hybridisation between forms reinforced the idea of a single species with several <a href="subspecies" class="uri" title="wikilink">subspecies</a>, nine of which are now recognised. The adult Australian Magpie is a fairly robust bird ranging from 37–43 cm (14.5–17 in) in length, with distinctive black and white <a href="plumage" class="uri" title="wikilink">plumage</a>, red eyes and a solid wedge-shaped bluish-white and black bill. The male and female are similar in appearance, and can be distinguished by differences in back markings. With its long legs, the Australian Magpie walks rather than waddles or hops and spends much time on the ground. This adaptation has led to some authorities maintaining it in its own genus <em>Gymnorhina</em>. Described as one of Australia's most accomplished songbirds, the Australian Magpie has an array of complex vocalisations.</p>
<p>The Australian Magpie is <a href="omnivore" title="wikilink">omnivorous</a>, with the bulk of its varied diet made up of <a href="invertebrates" class="uri" title="wikilink">invertebrates</a>. It is generally sedentary and territorial throughout its range. Common and widespread, it has adapted well to human habitation and is a familiar bird of parks, gardens and farmland in Australia and <a href="New_Guinea" title="wikilink">New Guinea</a>. Magpies were introduced into <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> in the 1860s and are proving to be a pest by displacing native birds. Introductions also occurred in the <a href="Solomon_Islands" title="wikilink">Solomon Islands</a> and <a href="Fiji" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fiji</a>, where these birds have not become <a href="Invasive_species" title="wikilink">invasive</a>.</p>
<p>Spring in Australia is magpie season, when a small minority of breeding magpies (almost always males) around the country become aggressive and swoop and attack those who approach their nests, especially bike riders. This species is commonly fed by households around the country and is the mascot of several famous Australian sporting teams.</p>

<p>The Australian Magpie was first described by English ornithologist <a href="John_Latham_(ornithologist)" title="wikilink">John Latham</a> in 1802 as <em>Coracias tibicen</em>, the type collected in the <a href="Port_Jackson" title="wikilink">Port Jackson</a> region.

<p>The bird was named for its similarity in colouration to the <a href="European_Magpie" title="wikilink">European Magpie</a>; it was a common practice for early settlers to name plants and animals after European counterparts.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> However, the European Magpie is a member of the <a href="Corvidae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Corvidae</a>, while its Australian counterpart is placed in the <a href="Artamidae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Artamidae</a> family (although both are members of a broad <a href="corvida" title="wikilink">corvid</a> lineage). The Australian Magpie's affinities with butcherbirds and currawongs were recognised early on and the three genera were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by <a href="John_Albert_Leach" title="wikilink">John Albert Leach</a> after he had studied their musculature.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> American ornithologists <a href="Charles_Sibley" title="wikilink">Charles Sibley</a> and <a href="Jon_Edward_Ahlquist" title="wikilink">Jon Ahlquist</a> recognised the close relationship between <a href="woodswallow" title="wikilink">woodswallows</a> and the butcherbirds in 1985, and placed them in a Cracticini clade,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> now the family Artamidae.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The Australian Magpie had been placed in its own genus <em>Gymnorhina</em>, however several authorities, Storr in 1952 and later authors including Christidis and Boles in their 2008 official checklist, place it in the butcherbird genus <em>Cracticus</em>, giving rise to its current binomial name; they argue that its adaptation to ground-living is not enough to consider it as a separate genus.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The Australian Magpie was subdivided into three species in the literature for much of the twentieth century&lt;U+2014&gt;the Black-backed Magpie (<em>G. tibicen</em>), the White-backed Magpie (<em>G. hypoleuca</em>), and the Western Magpie (<em>G. dorsalis</em>).<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> They were later noted to <a href="hybrid_(biology)" title="wikilink">hybridise</a> readily where their territories crossed, with hybrid grey or striped-backed magpies being quite common.

<p>There are currently thought to be nine subspecies of the Australian Magpie, however there are large zones of overlap with intermediate forms between the taxa. There is a tendency for birds to become larger with increasing latitude, the southern subspecies being larger than those further north the exception being the Tasmanian form which is small.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The original form known as the <strong>Black-backed Magpie</strong> and classified as <em>Gymnorhina tibicen</em> has been split into four black-backed races:</p>

The black legs are long and strong.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The plumage is pure glossy black and white; both sexes of all subspecies have black heads, wings and underparts with white shoulders. The tail has a black terminal band. The nape is white in the male and light greyish-white in the female. Mature magpies have dull red eyes, in contrast to the yellow eyes of currawongs and white eyes of Australian ravens and crows.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The main difference between the subspecies lies in the &quot;saddle&quot; markings on the back below the nape. Black-backed subspecies have a black saddle and white nape.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> White-backed subspecies have a wholly white nape and saddle. The male Western Australian subspecies <em>dorsalis</em> is also white-backed, but the equivalent area in the female is scalloped black.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Juveniles have lighter greys and browns amidst the starker blacks and whites of their plumage;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> two or three year old birds of both sexes closely resemble and are difficult to distinguish from adult females.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Immature birds have dark brownish eyes until around two years of age.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Australian Magpies generally live to around 25 years of age,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> though ages of up to 30 years have been recorded.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The reported age of first breeding has varied according to area, but the average is between the ages of three and five years.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>Well-known and easily recognisable, the Australian Magpie is unlikely to be confused with any other species.

<h3 id="vocalisations">Vocalisations</h3>
<p>One of Australia's most highly-regarded songbirds, the Australian Magpie has a wide variety of calls, many of which are complex. Pitch may vary over up to four octaves,<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> and the bird can mimic over 35 species of native and introduced bird species, as well as dogs and horses.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Its complex, musical, warbling call is one of the most familiar Australian bird sounds. In <a href="Denis_Glover" title="wikilink">Denis Glover</a>'s poem <a href="The_Magpies" title="wikilink">The Magpies</a>, the mature magpie's call is described as <em>quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle</em>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a>, one of the most famous lines in New Zealand poetry, and in the children's book <em>Waddle Giggle Gargle</em> by <a href="Pamela_Allen" title="wikilink">Pamela Allen</a>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>When alone, a magpie may make a quiet musical warbling; these complex melodious warbles or subsongs are pitched at 2–4 K<a href="Hertz" title="wikilink">Hz</a> and do not carry for long distances. These songs have been recorded up to 70 minutes in duration and are more frequent after the end of the breeding season.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Pairs of magpies often take up a loud musical calling known as <em>carolling</em> to advertise or defend their territory; one bird initiates the call with the second (and sometimes more) joining in.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Often preceded by warbling,<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> carolling is pitched between 6–8 kHz and has 4–5 elements with slurring indistinct noise in between.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Birds will adopt a specific posture by tilting their heads back, expanding their chests, and moving their wings backwards.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> A group of magpies will sing a short repetitive version of carolling just before dawn (<em>dawn song</em>), and at twilight after sundown (<em>dusk song</em>), in winter and spring.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>Fledgling and juvenile magpies emit a repeated short and loud (80 <a href="Decibel" title="wikilink">dB</a>), high-pitched (8 kHz) begging call.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Magpies may indulge in beak-clapping to warn other species of birds.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> They employ several high pitched (8–10 kHz) alarm or rallying calls when intruders or threats are spotted.

Birds nest and shelter in trees but forage mainly on the ground in these open areas.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> It has also been recorded in mature <a href="pine_plantation" title="wikilink">pine plantations</a>; birds only occupy rainforest and wet <a href="sclerophyll_forest" title="wikilink">sclerophyll forest</a> in the vicinity of cleared areas.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> In general, evidence suggests the range and population of the Australian Magpie has increased with land-clearing, although local declines in Queensland due to a 1902 drought, and in Tasmania in the 1930s have been noted; the cause for the latter is unclear but rabbit baiting, pine tree removal, and spread of the <a href="Masked_Lapwing" title="wikilink">Masked Lapwing</a> (<em>Vanellus miles</em>) have been implicated.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="behaviour">Behaviour</h2>
<p>The Australian Magpie is almost exclusively <a href="diurnality" title="wikilink">diurnal</a>, although it may call into the night, like some other members of the Artamidae.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Natural predators of magpies include various species of <a href="monitor_lizard" title="wikilink">monitor lizard</a> and the <a href="Barking_Owl" title="wikilink">Barking Owl</a>.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Birds have also been killed on roads or electrocuted by powerlines, or poisoned after killing and eating House Sparrows or mice, rats or rabbits targeted with baiting.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> The <a href="Australian_Raven" title="wikilink">Australian Raven</a> may take nestlings left unattended.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Gymnorhina_tibicen_(Magpie_venturing_inside).jpg" title="fig:Displaying walking gait" alt="Displaying walking gait" /> On the ground, the Australian Magpie moves around by walking, and is the only member of the Artamidae to do so; woodswallows, butcherbirds and currawongs all tend to hop with legs parallel. The magpie has a short <a href="femur" class="uri" title="wikilink">femur</a> (thigh bone), and long lower leg below the knee, suited to walking rather than running, although birds can run in short bursts when hunting prey.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>The magpie is generally sedentary and territorial throughout its range, living in groups occupying a territory, or in flocks or fringe groups. A group may occupy and defend the same territory for many years.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Much energy is spent defending a territory from intruders, particularly other magpies, and different behaviours are seen with different opponents. The sight of a <a href="bird_of_prey" title="wikilink">raptor</a> results in a rallying call by sentinel birds and subsequent coordinated mobbing of the intruder. Magpies place themselves either side of the bird of prey so that it will be attacked from behind should it strike a defender, and harass and drive the raptor to some distance beyond the territory.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> A group will use carolling as a signal to advertise ownership and warn off other magpies. In the <em>negotiating display</em>, the one or two dominant magpies parade along the border of the defended territory while the rest of the group stand back a little and look on. The leaders may fluff their feathers or caroll repeatedly. In a <em>group strength display</em>, employed if both the opposing and defending groups are of roughly equal numbers, all magpies will fly and form a row at the border of the territory.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> The defending group may also resort to an aerial display where the dominant magpies, or sometimes the whole group, swoop and dive while calling to warn an intruding magpie's group.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Magpie_inflight.jpg" title="fig:Female, subsp. tyrannica, in flight" alt="Female, subsp. tyrannica, in flight" />A wide variety of displays are seen, with aggressive behaviours outnumbering pro-social ones.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Crouching low and uttering quiet begging calls are common signs of submission.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> The <em>manus flutter</em> is a submissive display where a magpie will flutter its <a href="Flight_feather#Primaries" title="wikilink">primary feathers</a> in its wings.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> A magpie, particularly a juvenile, may also fall, roll over on its back and expose its underparts.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Birds may fluff up their flank feathers as an aggressive display or preceding an attack.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Young birds display various forms of play behaviour, either by themselves or in groups, with older birds often initiating the proceedings with juveniles. These may involve picking up, manipulating or tugging at various objects such as sticks, rocks or bits of wire, and handing them to other birds. A bird may pick up a feather or leaf and flying off with it, with other birds pursuing and attempting to bring down the leader by latching onto its tail feathers. Birds may jump on each other and even engage in mock fighting. Play may even take place with other species such as <a href="Blue-faced_Honeyeater" title="wikilink">Blue-faced Honeyeaters</a> and <a href="Australasian_Pipit" title="wikilink">Australasian Pipits</a>.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="feeding">Feeding</h3>
<p><img src="Tasmag1.JPG" title="fig:Tasmanian subsecies being hand fed" alt="Tasmanian subsecies being hand fed" /> The Australian Magpie is omnivorous, eating various items located at or near ground level including invertebrates such as <a href="earthworm" title="wikilink">earthworms</a>, <a href="millipede" title="wikilink">millipedes</a>, <a href="snail" title="wikilink">snails</a>, <a href="spider" title="wikilink">spiders</a> and <a href="scorpion" title="wikilink">scorpions</a> as well as a wide variety of <a href="insect" title="wikilink">insects</a>—<a href="cockroach" title="wikilink">cockroaches</a>, ants, beetles, moths and caterpillars and other larvae. <a href="Skink" title="wikilink">Skinks</a>, frogs, mice and other small animals as well as grain, tubers, figs and walnuts have also been noted as components of their diet.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> It has even learnt to safely eat the poisonous <a href="cane_toad" title="wikilink">cane toad</a> by flipping it over and consuming the underparts.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Predominantly a ground feeder, the Australian Magpie paces open areas methodically searching for insects and their larvae.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> One study showed birds were able to find <a href="Scarabaeidae" title="wikilink">scarab beetle</a> larvae by sound or vibration.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Birds use their bills to probe into the earth or otherwise overturn debris in search of food.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Smaller prey are swallowed whole, although magpies rub off the stingers of bees and wasps before swallowing.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="breeding">Breeding</h3>
<p><img src="Magnest3.JPG" title="fig:Nest in a banksia tree" alt="Nest in a banksia tree" /> Magpies have a long breeding season which varies in different parts of the country; in northern parts of Australia they will breed between June and September, but not commence until August or September in cooler regions, and may continue until January in some alpine areas.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> The nest is a bowl-shaped structure made of sticks and lined with softer material such as grass and bark. Near human habitation, synthetic material may be incorporated.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Nests are built exclusively by females and generally placed high up in a tree fork, often in an exposed position.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> The trees used are most commonly <a href="eucalypt" title="wikilink">eucalypts</a>, although a variety of other native trees as well as introduced <a href="pine" class="uri" title="wikilink">pine</a>, <em><a href="Crataegus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crataegus</a></em>, and <a href="elm" class="uri" title="wikilink">elm</a> have been recorded.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Other bird species, such as the <a href="Yellow-rumped_Thornbill" title="wikilink">Yellow-rumped Thornbill</a> (<em>Acanthiza chrysorrhoa</em>), <a href="Willie_Wagtail" title="wikilink">Willie Wagtail</a> (<em>Rhipidura leucophrys</em>), <a href="Southern_Whiteface" title="wikilink">Southern Whiteface</a> (<em>Aphelocephala leucopsis</em>), and (less commonly) <a href="Noisy_Miner" title="wikilink">Noisy Miner</a> (<em>Manorina melanocephala</em>), often nest in the same tree as the magpie. The first two species may even locate their nest directly beneath a magpie nest, while the diminutive <a href="Striated_Pardalote" title="wikilink">Striated Pardalote</a> (<em>Pardalotus striatus</em>) has been known to make a burrow for breeding into the base of the magpie nest itself. These incursions are all tolerated by the magpies.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> The <a href="Channel-billed_Cuckoo" title="wikilink">Channel-billed Cuckoo</a> (<em>Scythrops novaehollandiae</em>) is a notable brood parasite in eastern Australia; magpies will raise cuckoo young, which eventually outcompete the magpie nestlings.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Gymnorhina_tibicen,_nesting.JPG" title="fig:Western Magpie female (note scalloped back) collecting nesting material" alt="Western Magpie female (note scalloped back) collecting nesting material" /> The Australian Magpie produces a clutch of two to five light blue or greenish <a href="egg_(biology)" title="wikilink">eggs</a>, which are oval in shape and about 27 x 38 mm (1 x 1.5 in).<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> The chicks hatch synchronously around 20 days after <a href="Avian_incubation" title="wikilink">incubation</a> begins; like all <a href="passerine" title="wikilink">passerines</a>, the chicks are <a href="altricial" class="uri" title="wikilink">altricial</a>—they are born pink, naked, and blind with large feet, a short broad beak and a bright red throat. Their eyes are fully open at around 10 days. Chicks develop fine downy feathers on their head, back and wings in the first week, and pinfeathers in the second week. The black and white coloration is noticeable from an early stage.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Nestlings are fed exclusively by the female, though the male magpie will feed his partner.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> The Australian Magpie is known to engage in <a href="cooperative_breeding" title="wikilink">cooperative breeding</a>, and helper birds will assist in feeding and raising young.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> This does vary from region to region, and with the size of the group—the behaviour is rare or nonexistent in pairs or small groups.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p>Juvenile magpies begin foraging on their own three weeks after leaving the nest, and mostly feeding themselves by six months old. Some birds continue begging for food until eight or nine months of age, but are usually ignored. Birds reach adult size by their first year.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> The age at which young birds disperse varies across the country, and depends on the aggressiveness of the dominant adult of the corresponding sex; males are usually evicted at a younger age. Many leave at around a year old, but the age of departure may range from eight months to four years.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="relationship-with-humans">Relationship with humans</h2>
<h3 id="swooping">Swooping</h3>
<p>Magpies are ubiquitous in urban areas all over Australia, and have become accustomed to people. A small percentage of birds become highly aggressive during breeding season from late August to early October, and will swoop and sometimes attack passersby. The percentage has been difficult to estimate but is significantly less than 9%.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> Almost all attacking birds (around 99%) are male,<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> and they are generally known to attack pedestrians at around 50 m (150 ft) from their nest, and cyclists at around 100 m (300 ft).<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Attacks begin as the eggs hatch, increase in frequency and severity as the chicks grow, and tail off as the chicks leave the nest.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>These magpies may engage in an escalating series of behaviours to drive off intruders. Least threatening are alarm calls and distant swoops, where birds fly within several metres from behind and perch nearby. Next in intensity are close swoops, where a magpie will swoop in from behind or the side and audibly &quot;snap&quot; their beaks or even peck or bite at the face, neck, ears or eyes. More rarely, a bird may dive-bomb and strike the intruder's (usually a cyclist's) head with its chest. A magpie may rarely attack by landing on the ground in front of a person and lurching up and landing on the victim's chest and peck at the face and eyes.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
<p>Magpie attacks can cause injuries, typically wounds to the head and particularly the eyes, with potential detached retinas and bacterial infections from a beak used to <a href="Fossicking" title="wikilink">fossick</a> in the ground.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> A 13-year-old boy died from <a href="tetanus" class="uri" title="wikilink">tetanus</a>, apparently from a magpie injury, in northern New South Wales in 1946.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> Being unexpectedly swooped while cycling is not uncommon, and can result in loss of control of the bicycle, which may cause injury.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a><a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>

<p>If it is necessary to walk near the nest, wearing a broad-brimmed or legionnaire's hat or using an umbrella will deter attacking birds, but beanies and bicycle helmets are of little value as birds attack the sides of the head and neck.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> Eyes painted on hats or helmets will deter attacks on pedestrians but not cyclists.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> Attaching a long pole with a flag to a bike is an effective deterrent.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> As of 2008, the use of cable ties on helmets has become common and appears to be effective.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> Magpies prefer to swoop at the back of the head; therefore, keeping the magpie in sight at all times can discourage the bird. Using a basic disguise to fool the magpie as to where a person is looking (such as painting eyes on a hat, or wearing sunglasses on the back of the head) can also prove effective. In some cases, magpies may become extremely aggressive and attack people's faces; it may become very difficult to deter these birds from swooping. Once attacked, shouting aggressively and waving one's arms at the bird should deter a second attack. If a bird presents a serious nuisance the local authorities may arrange for that bird to be legally destroyed, or more commonly, to be caught and translocated to an unpopulated area.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> Magpies have to be moved some distance as almost all are able to find their way home from distances of less than 25 km.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> Removing the nest is of no use as birds will simply breed again and possibly be more aggressive the second time around.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
<p>Magpies are a protected native species in Australia, so it is illegal to kill or harm them. However, this protection is removed in some Australian States if a magpie attacks a human, allowing for the bird to be destroyed if it is considered particularly aggressive (such a provision is made, for example, in section 54 of the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act).<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> It is claimed by some that swooping can be prevented by hand-feeding magpies. The idea is that humans thereby appear less of a threat to the nesting birds. This has not been studied systematically, although there are reports of its success.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>
