<p><strong>Edgar G. &quot;Sonny&quot; Mouton, Jr.</strong>, (born <a href="September_22" title="wikilink">September 22</a>, <a href="1929" class="uri" title="wikilink">1929</a>) is a prominent <a href="Lafayette,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Lafayette</a> attorney who was a <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic</a> member of the <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a> <a href="Louisiana_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">House of Representatives</a> from <a href="1964" class="uri" title="wikilink">1964</a> to <a href="1966" class="uri" title="wikilink">1966</a> and the state Senate from 1966-<a href="1980" class="uri" title="wikilink">1980</a>. He ran unsuccessfully for governor in the <a href="1979" class="uri" title="wikilink">1979</a> <a href="jungle_primary" title="wikilink">jungle primary</a>.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Mouton (pronouned MOO TAHN) became the executive counsel (1980-<a href="1983" class="uri" title="wikilink">1983</a>) to newly-elected Governor <a href="David_C._Treen" title="wikilink">David C. Treen</a>, the first Louisiana <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> to hold the office since <a href="Reconstruction" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reconstruction</a>. In <a href="1985" class="uri" title="wikilink">1985</a>, he returned briefly as a special consultant to Governor <a href="Edwin_Washington_Edwards" title="wikilink">Edwin Washington Edwards</a>, who had won a third term in the 1983 primary by unseating Treen.</p>
<p>Mouton was born in Lafayette to Mr. and Mrs. Edgar G. Mouton, Sr. He attended Cathedral High School and graduated as class valedictorian in <a href="1947" class="uri" title="wikilink">1947</a>. He received his bachelor's degree from <a href="Tulane_University" title="wikilink">Tulane University</a> in <a href="New_Orleans" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a> in <a href="1951" class="uri" title="wikilink">1951</a>. He obtained his <a href="Juris_Doctor" title="wikilink">Juris Doctor</a> degree from Tulane in <a href="1953" class="uri" title="wikilink">1953</a>.</p>
<h2 id="elections-to-the-state-house-and-senate">Elections to the state House and Senate</h2>
<p>Having served only two years as a representative, Mouton entered a <a href="special_election" title="wikilink">special election</a> for the District 23 Senate seat early in 1966. He was elected and served in the Senate for 14 years. When Mouton became a senator, his state House seat went Republican -- the first time since <a href="Reconstruction" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reconstruction</a> that a Republican had won a legislative seat in <a href="Lafayette_Parish" title="wikilink">Lafayette Parish</a>. The new lawmaker was Mouton's special friend, <a href="Roderick_Miller" title="wikilink">Roderick Luke Miller</a> (<a href="1924" class="uri" title="wikilink">1924</a>-<a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>).</p>
<p>In the Louisiana state general election held on <a href="February_6" title="wikilink">February 6</a>, <a href="1968" class="uri" title="wikilink">1968</a>, Mouton was challenged by Miller, who had been a representative for just under two years himself. Mouton easily defeated Miller -- 57.1 -- 42.9 percent. Miller, however, would not give up so easily. In <a href="1972" class="uri" title="wikilink">1972</a>, Miller challenged Mouton for state senate reelection and lost again. Mouton then polled 18,771 votes (62.2 percent) to Miller's 11,395 (37.8 percent).</p>
<p>Miller and Mouton, in their two campaigns, debated &quot;issues&quot; and declined to engage in personal attacks to gain an advantage. Miller depicted himself as one oriented toward business growth, whereas Mouton's philosophy, he claimed, involved the expansion of government. Mouton, however, saw himself as a &quot;people senator&quot; there to lend assistance to those that he could help.</p>
<p>Mouton defended the interests of teachers and state employees. He worked for salary increases, which more likely than not were less than he had desired. He was generally considered a &quot;liberal&quot; senator by Louisiana standards but &quot;moderate&quot; from a national viewpoint. In his third full Senate term, <a href="1976" class="uri" title="wikilink">1976</a>-1980, he was elected President Pro-Tempore. Mouton was hence the first non-lieutenant governor to preside over the state Senate under the Louisiana Constitution of <a href="1974" class="uri" title="wikilink">1974</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-cajun-candidate-for-governor-1979">The &quot;Cajun&quot; candidate for governor, 1979</h2>
<p>In 1979, at the age of 50, Senate President Pro-Tempore Mouton sought to become the &quot;Cajun&quot; candidate to succeed Democrat Edwin Edwards, Louisiana's first governor from what had become known as &quot;Acadiana&quot; in many decades. Mouton's claim as the &quot;Cajun&quot; candidate was strengthened by virtue of his having been the principal author of the legislation which created the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana, popularly known as CODOFIL. Mouton had also pushed successfully for adoption of the state constitution, which assures all citizens of their cultural and linguistic heritage.</p>
<p>However, he faced a rival within the &quot;Cajun&quot; ranks, young Secretary of State <a href="Paul_Hardy" title="wikilink">Paul Hardy</a> (born <a href="1942" class="uri" title="wikilink">1942</a>) who though he has an English name is fluent in <a href="French_(language)" title="wikilink">French</a>. Mouton and Hardy divided the &quot;Cajun&quot; vote in the primary, and neither secured a general election slot. In fact, Hardy ran fourth, with 227,026 votes (16.6 percent) followed by outgoing House Speaker <a href="E.L._&quot;Bubba&quot;_Henry" title="wikilink">E.L. &quot;Bubba&quot; Henry</a> (born <a href="1936" class="uri" title="wikilink">1936</a>) of <a href="Jonesboro,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Jonesboro</a>, the seat of <a href="Jackson_Parish" title="wikilink">Jackson Parish</a>, in north Louisiana. Mouton finished in a disappointing sixth position. Henry received 135,299 votes (9.9 percent) to Mouton's 123,126 (9.1 percent).</p>
<p>The general election was between the Republican frontrunner Treen (21.8 percent) and then Public Service Commissioner <a href="Louis_Lambert" title="wikilink">Louis J. Lambert</a> (20.7 percent) of <a href="Ascension_Parish" title="wikilink">Ascension Parish</a>, near Baton Rouge. Treen emerged as the general election winner by fewer than 10,000 votes. Hardy, Henry, Mouton, and the third-place finisher, outgoing Lieutenant Governor <a href="Jimmy_Fitzmorris" title="wikilink">James E. Fitzmorris, Jr.</a>, of New Orleans all endorsed Treen over Lambert, who had the support of the traditional Democratic <a href="interest_group" title="wikilink">interest groups</a>.</p>
<p>Treen appointed Mouton as his gubernatorial counsel. Mouton succeeded his friend, Judge <a href="Edmund_Reggie" title="wikilink">Edmund Reggie</a> of <a href="Crowley,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Crowley</a> in <a href="Acadia_Parish" title="wikilink">Acadia Parish</a>, who was the counsel under Edwards. Reggie is also the father-in-law of the powerful Democratic U.S. Senator <a href="Edward_M._Kennedy" title="wikilink">Edward M. Kennedy</a> of Massachusetts.</p>
<h2 id="moutons-enduring-legacy">Mouton's enduring legacy</h2>
<p>Mouton is <a href="Roman_Catholic" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a>. He and his wife, Patsy Mouton, reside in Lafayette. He has been president of the Hub City Kiwanis Club, national vice-president of the Muscular Dystrophy Association, a board memberr of Lafayette <a href="Chamber_of_Commerce" title="wikilink">Chamber of Commerce</a>, Chairman of the Bishop Services Appeal, a board member of Catholic Charities, and a member of the Lafayette Parish Bar Association.</p>
<p>When his friend, former Lafayette Mayor <a href="Kenny_Bowen" title="wikilink">Kenneth Francis &quot;Kenny&quot; Bowen</a> , a Democrat, died of cancer in <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a>, Mouton delivered a moving eulogy at the funeral. When his friend Roderick Miller, a Republican, died of cancer early in 2005, Mouton issued a similarly touching tribute in an article published in the <i>Lafayette Daily Advertiser</i>, his hometown newspaper. The tributes can be accessed under the Wikipedia articles entitled <a href="Kenny_Bowen" title="wikilink">Kenny Bowen</a> and <a href="Roderick_Miller" title="wikilink">Roderick Miller</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>, Mouton was nominated as a &quot;Living Legend&quot; by the Acadian Museum in <a href="Erath,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Erath</a>. In <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a>, Mouton, along with Judge Reggie, was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in <a href="Winnfield,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Winnfield</a>.</p>
