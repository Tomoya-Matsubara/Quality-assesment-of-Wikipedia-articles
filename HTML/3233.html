<p><strong>Troy</strong> is a <a href="city" class="uri" title="wikilink">city</a> in <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">U.S.</a>, and the <a href="county_seat" title="wikilink">county seat</a> of <a href="Rensselaer_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Rensselaer County</a>. As of the <a href="United_States_Census_2000" title="wikilink">2000 census</a>, the population was 49,170. Troy's motto is <em>Ilium fuit, Troja est,</em> which means &quot;Ilium was, Troy is.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Troy is located on the western edge of Rensselaer County and on the eastern bank of the <a href="Hudson_River" title="wikilink">Hudson River</a>. Troy has close ties with the nearby cities of <a href="Albany,_New_York" title="wikilink">Albany</a> and <a href="Schenectady,_New_York" title="wikilink">Schenectady</a>, forming a region popularly called the <a href="Capital_District" title="wikilink">Capital District</a>. This area makes up the bulk of the Albany-Schenectady-Troy Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) with a population of 850,957. Troy is home to <a href="Rensselaer_Polytechnic_Institute" title="wikilink">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>, <a href="Russell_Sage_College" title="wikilink">Russell Sage College</a>, <a href="Hudson_Valley_Community_College" title="wikilink">Hudson Valley Community College</a> and the <a href="Emma_Willard_School" title="wikilink">Emma Willard School</a>, and was the hometown of <a href="Samuel_Wilson" title="wikilink">Uncle Sam</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The site of the city was a part of the <a href="Kiliaen_Van_Rensselaer" title="wikilink">Van Rensselaer</a> grant of 1629. Dirck Van der Heyden was one of the first settlers. In 1707, he purchased a farm of  which in 1787 was laid out as a village.</p>
<p>A local legend that a Dutch girl had been kidnapped by an Indian male who did not want her to marry someone else gained some credence when two skeletons were found in a cave under Poestenkill Falls in the 1950s. One skeleton was female and Caucasian with an iron ring. The other was Native-American and male.</p>
<p>The name Troy (after the legendary city of <a href="Troy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Troy</a>, made famous in <a href="Homer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homer</a>'s <em><a href="Iliad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iliad</a></em>) was adopted in 1789, and the region was formed into the Town of Troy in 1791 from part of the <a href="Rensselaerwyck" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rensselaerwyck</a> Manor. The township included the current city and the town of <a href="Brunswick,_New_York" title="wikilink">Brunswick</a>. Troy became a village in 1801 and was chartered as a city in 1816. In 1900, the city of Lansingburgh was merged into Troy.</p>
<p>In the post-Revolutionary War years, as central New York was first settled, there was a strong trend to classical names, and Troy's naming fits the same pattern as the New York cities of Syracuse, Rome, Utica, Ithaca, or the towns of Sempronius, Manlius, or dozens of other classically named towns to the west of Troy.</p>
<p>Northern and Western New York was a theater of the <a href="War_of_1812" title="wikilink">War of 1812</a>, and militia and regular army forces were led by <a href="Stephen_Van_Rensselaer" title="wikilink">Stephen Van Rensselaer</a> of Troy. Quartermaster supplies were shipped through Troy. A local butcher and meat-packer named <a href="Samuel_Wilson" title="wikilink">Samuel Wilson</a> supplied the military, and, according to an unprovable legend, barrels stamped &quot;U.S.&quot; were jokingly taken by the troops to stand for &quot;<a href="Uncle_Sam" title="wikilink">Uncle Sam</a>&quot; meaning Wilson. Troy has since claimed to be the historical home of Uncle Sam.</p>
<p>Through much of the 19th and into the early 20th century, Troy was not only one of the most prosperous cities in New York State, but one of the most prosperous cities in the entire country. Prior to its rise as an industrial center, Troy was the transshipment point for meat and vegetables from Vermont which were sent by the Hudson River to New York City. The Federal Dam at Troy is the head of the tides in the Hudson River and Hudson River sloops and steamboats plied the river on a regular basis. This trade was vastly increased after the construction of the <a href="Erie_Canal" title="wikilink">Erie Canal</a>, with its eastern terminus directly across the Hudson from Troy at Cohoes in 1825.</p>
<p>Troy's one-time great wealth was produced in the steel industry, with the first American <a href="Bessemer_process" title="wikilink">Bessemer converter</a> erected on the small Postenkill river in a small valley near the middle of the city. The industry first used charcoal and iron ore from the Adirondacks. Later on, ore and coal from the Midwest was shipped on the <a href="Erie_Canal" title="wikilink">Erie Canal</a> to Troy, and there processed before being sent on down the Hudson to New York City. The iron and steel was also used by the extensive federal arsenal across the Hudson at <a href="Watervliet,_New_York" title="wikilink">Watervliet, New York</a>, then called West Troy. After the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a>, the steel production industry moved west to be closer to raw materials. The presence of iron and steel also made it possible for Troy to be an early site in the development of iron storefronts and steel structural supports in architecture, and there are some significant early examples still in the city.</p>
<p>The initial emphasis on heavier industry later spawned a wide variety of highly engineered mechanical and scientific equipment. Troy was the home of <a href="Gurley_Precision_Instruments" title="wikilink">W. &amp; L. E. Gurley, Co.</a>, makers of precision instruments. Gurley's theodolites were used to survey much of the American West after the Civil War and were highly regarded until laser and digital technology eclipsed the telescope and compass technology in the 1970s. Bells manufactured by Troy's <a href="Meneely_Bell_Company" title="wikilink">Meneely Bell Company</a> ring all over the world. And Troy was also home to a manufacturer of racing shells that used impregnated paper in a process that presaged the later use of fiberglass, Kevlar and carbon fiber composites.</p>
<p>This scientific and technical proficiency was supported by the presence of <a href="Rensselaer_Polytechnic_Institute" title="wikilink">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>, or RPI, one of the highest-ranked engineering schools in the country.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> RPI was originally sponsored by <a href="Stephen_Van_Rensselaer" title="wikilink">Stephen Van Rensselaer</a>, one of the most prominent members of that family. RPI was founded in 1824, and eventually absorbed the campus of the short-lived, liberal arts based <a href="Troy_University_(New_York)" title="wikilink">Troy University</a>, which closed in 1862 during the Civil War. Rensselaer founded RPI for the &quot;application of science to the common purposes of life&quot;, and it is the oldest technological university in the English-speaking world.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The institute is known for its success in the transfer of technology from the laboratory to the marketplace.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>On December 23, 1823, <em>The <a href="Troy_Sentinel" title="wikilink">Troy Sentinel</a></em> was the first publisher of the world-famous Christmas poem &quot;<a href="A_Visit_from_St._Nicholas" title="wikilink">A Visit from St. Nicholas</a>&quot; (also known as &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot; or &quot;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot;). The poem was published anonymously. Its author has long been believed to have been <a href="Clement_Clarke_Moore" title="wikilink">Clement Clarke Moore</a>, but its author is now regarded by a few to have been <a href="Henry_Livingston,_Jr." title="wikilink">Henry Livingston, Jr.</a></p>
<p>Troy was an early home of professional baseball, and was the host of two major league teams. The first team to call Troy home was the <a href="Troy_Haymakers" title="wikilink">Troy Haymakers</a>, a <a href="National_Association" title="wikilink">National Association</a> team in 1871 and 1872. One of their major players was <a href="Bill_Craver" title="wikilink">Williams H. &quot;Bill&quot; Craver</a>, a noted catcher and Civil War veteran, who also managed the team. Their last manager was <a href="Jimmy_Wood" title="wikilink">Jimmy Wood</a>, reckoned the first Canadian in professional baseball. The Troy Haymakers folded, and Troy had no team for seven seasons. Then, for four seasons, 1879 to 1882, Troy was home to the <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> <a href="Troy_Trojans_(MLB_team)" title="wikilink">Troy Trojans</a>. The Trojans were not competitive in the league, but they did have the biggest hitter in professional baseball, Dan Brouthers.<a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teams/troy.shtml">1</a> For the 1883 season, the Trojans were moved to New York City where they became the <a href="New_York_Gothams" title="wikilink">New York Gothams</a>, better know later as the Giants. The Gothams had the same ownership as the <a href="New_York_Metropolitans" title="wikilink">New York Metropolitans</a> of the rival American Association. As a result classic Met players became Giants, including Hall of Fame Pitcher Tim Keefe. Troy was also the birthplace of the famous player <a href="King_Kelly" title="wikilink">Michael Joseph &quot;King&quot; Kelly</a>.</p>
<p>Troy has been nearly destroyed by fire three times. The Great Troy fire of 1862 burnt the W. &amp; L. E. Gurley, Co. factory, which was later that year replaced by the new <a href="W._&amp;_L._E._Gurley_Building" title="wikilink">W. &amp; L. E. Gurley Building</a>, now a <a href="National_Historic_Landmark" title="wikilink">National Historic Landmark</a>.</p>
<p>In 1892, there were election riots there during which Robert Ross was murdered. One of his alleged slayers, &quot;Bat&quot; Shea, was executed in 1896.</p>
<p>In 1900 Troy annexed <a href="Lansingburgh,_New_York" title="wikilink">Lansingburgh</a>, a former town and village in Rensselaer County. Lansingburgh is thus often referred to as &quot;North Troy&quot;. However, prior to the annexation, that portion of Troy north of Division Street was called North Troy and the neighborhood south of Washington Park is referred to as South Troy. To avoid confusion with streets in Troy following the annexation, Lansingburgh's numbered streets were renamed: its 1st Street, 2nd Street, 3rd Street, etc., became North Troy's 101st Street, 102nd Street, 103rd Street, etc. Lansingburgh was home to the <a href="Lansingburgh_Academy" title="wikilink">Lansingburgh Academy</a>.</p>
<p><img src="Leyendecker_arrow_color_1907.jpg" title="fig:Illustration for Arrow Collar, 1907. J.C. Leyendecker." alt="Illustration for Arrow Collar, 1907. J.C. Leyendecker." /> In addition to the strong presence of the early American steel industry, Troy was also a manufacturing center for shirts, shirtwaists, collars and cuffs. In 1825, a local resident <a href="false-collar" title="wikilink">Hannah Lord Montague</a>, was tired of cleaning her blacksmith husband's shirts. She cut off the collars of her husband's shirts, since only the collar was soiled, bound the edges and attached strings to hold them in place. (This also allowed the collars and cuffs to be starched separately.) Hannah Montague's idea caught on, and changed the fashion for American men's dress for a century. Her patented collars and cuffs were first manufactured by Maullin &amp; Blanchard, which eventually was absorbed by <a href="The_Arrow_Collar_Man" title="wikilink">Cluett, Peabody &amp; Company</a>. Cluett's &quot;Arrow shirts&quot; are still worn by men across the country.<a href="http://www.arrowshirt.com/heritage.aspx">2</a> The large labor force required by the shirt manufacturing industry also, in 1864, produced the nation's first female <a href="Labor_Union" title="wikilink">Labor Union</a>, the <a href="Collar_Laundry_Union" title="wikilink">Collar Laundry Union</a>, founded in Troy by <a href="Kate_Mullany" title="wikilink">Kate Mullany</a>. On February 23, 1864, 300 members of the union went on strike. After six days, the laundry owners gave in to their demands and raised wages 25 percent. There were further developments in the industry, when, in 1933, Sanford Cluett invented a process he called <a href="Sanforization" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sanforization</a>, a process which shrinks <a href="cotton" class="uri" title="wikilink">cotton</a> <a href="textile" title="wikilink">fabrics</a> thoroughly and permanently. Cluett, Peabody's last main plant in Troy was closed in the 1980s, but the industrial output of the plant had long been transferred to facilities in the South.</p>
<p>One of the downtown landmarks of troy was Frear's Troy Cash Bazaar, also known as Frear's Department Store, which was one of the largest in the state.</p>
<p>When the iron &amp; steel industry moved to Pennsylvania and beyond, and with a similar downturn in the collar industry, Troy's prosperity began to fade. After the passage of <a href="Prohibition" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prohibition</a>, and given the strict control of <a href="Albany,_New_York" title="wikilink">Albany</a> by the Daniel P. O'Connell political machine, Troy became a way station for an illegal alcohol trade from Canada to New York City. Likewise, the stricter control of morality laws in the neighboring <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a> states, left Troy with openly operating speakeasies and brothels. Gangsters such as <a href="Legs_Diamond" title="wikilink">Legs Diamond</a> conducted business in Troy. This gave Troy a somewhat colorful reputation through <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. A few of the finer houses have since been converted to fine restaurants, such as the former Old Daly Inn. Like many old industrial cities, Troy has had to deal with not only the loss of its manufacturing base, but a drainage of population and wealth to <a href="suburbs" class="uri" title="wikilink">suburbs</a> and other parts of the country. Troy's population in 1910 was over 75,000, this is more than 50% higher than today. These factors have lead to a sizable degree of dilapidation and disinvestment, although numerous efforts have been made to preserve Troy's architectural and cultural past.</p>

The city has a large number of intact <a href="Louis_Comfort_Tiffany" title="wikilink">Tiffany</a> stained-glass windows in original architectural settings.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> With much 19th century architecture, particularly in the <a href="Central_Troy_Historic_District" title="wikilink">Central Troy Historic District</a>, several major movies have filmed in Troy, including <em><a href="Ironweed" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ironweed</a></em>, <em><a href="Age_of_Innocence" title="wikilink">Age of Innocence</a></em>, <em><a href="Scent_of_a_Woman" title="wikilink">Scent of a Woman</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Bostonians" title="wikilink">The Bostonians</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Emperor&#39;s_Club" title="wikilink">The Emperor's Club</a></em>, and <em><a href="The_Time_Machine_(2002_film)" title="wikilink">The Time Machine</a>.</em> There are many buildings in a state of disrepair, but community groups and investors are restoring many of them.</p>

Left to right: Slocum Hall, Sage Hall, Hyphen, Kellas Hall, Alumnae Chapel" /> As with many American cities, several city blocks in downtown Troy were razed during the 1970s as a part of an attempted <a href="urban_renewal" title="wikilink">urban renewal</a> plan which was never successfully executed, leaving still vacant areas in the vicinity of Federal Street. Today, however, there have since been much more successful efforts to save the remaining historic downtown structures.</p>
<p>Part of this effort has been the arrival of the &quot;Antique District&quot; on River Street downtown. Cafes and art galleries are calling the area home. As home to many art, literature, and music lovers, the city hosts many free shows during the summer, on River Street, in parks, and in cafes and coffee shops. The <a href="http://www.troymarket.org/">Troy Farmer's Market</a>is a popular event since 2000 that occurs every Saturday on River Street during the summer, or in the Atrium of downtown Troy during the winter.</p>
<p>Troy has been known to recognize the contributions of its residents to local music and arts community. Mayor <a href="Harry_Tutunjian" title="wikilink">Harry Tutunjian</a> declared February 25th 2006 &lt;U+201C&gt;<a href="Super_400" title="wikilink">Super 400</a> Day in Troy&lt;U+201D&gt; in honor of the musical group's ten year anniversary.</p>
<p>Many notable artists were born or grew up in Troy, including actress <a href="Maureen_Stapleton" title="wikilink">Maureen Stapleton</a> and authors <a href="Alice_Fulton" title="wikilink">Alice Fulton</a>, <a href="Don_Rittner" title="wikilink">Don Rittner</a> and <a href="Richard_Selzer" title="wikilink">Richard Selzer</a>. Past notable residents include <a href="Herman_Melville" title="wikilink">Herman Melville</a>, <a href="Emma_Willard" title="wikilink">Emma Willard</a>, <a href="Russell_Sage" title="wikilink">Russell Sage</a>, and <a href="Jane_Fonda" title="wikilink">Jane Fonda</a>. Several books by noted author <a href="Kurt_Vonnegut" title="wikilink">Kurt Vonnegut</a> are set in the fictional city of &quot;Illium&quot;, which is modeled after Troy.</p>
<p>Troy has produced at least three <a href="Medal_of_Honor" title="wikilink">Medal of Honor</a> recipients, including Lt. Colonel William J. O'Brien and Sergeant Thomas A. Baker, both from U.S. Army, 105th Infantry, 27th Infantry Division in World War II, and Specialist Fourth Class Peter C. Guenette from U.S. Army, Company D, 2d Battalion (Airborne), 506th Infantry, 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile), in Vietnam.</p>
