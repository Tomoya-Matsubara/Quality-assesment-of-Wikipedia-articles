<p><img src="1907_Panic.png" title="fig:A swarm gathers on Wall Street during the bank panic in October 1907." alt="A swarm gathers on Wall Street during the bank panic in October 1907." width="250" /> The <strong>Panic of 1907,</strong> also known as the <strong>1907 Bankers' Panic</strong>, was a <a href="financial_crisis" title="wikilink">financial crisis</a> that occurred in the United States when its <a href="stock_market" title="wikilink">stock market</a> fell close to 50 percent from its peak the previous year. Panic occurred during a time of economic <a href="recession" class="uri" title="wikilink">recession</a>, when there were numerous <a href="bank_run" title="wikilink">runs on banks</a> and <a href="Trust_company" title="wikilink">trust companies</a>. The 1907 panic eventually spread throughout the nation, and many state and local banks and businesses entered into bankruptcy. Primary causes of the run included a retraction of <a href="market_liquidity" title="wikilink">market liquidity</a> by a number of New York City banks, a loss of confidence among depositors, and the absence of a statutory <a href="lender_of_last_resort" title="wikilink">lender of last resort</a>.</p>
<p>The crisis occurred after the failure of an October 1907 attempt to <a href="Cornering_the_market" title="wikilink">corner the market</a> on <a href="stock" class="uri" title="wikilink">stock</a> of the <a href="United_Copper" title="wikilink">United Copper Company</a>. When this bid failed, banks that had lent money to the cornering scheme suffered runs which later spread to affiliated banks and trusts, leading a week later to the downfall of the <a href="Knickerbocker_Trust_Company" title="wikilink">Knickerbocker Trust Company</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;New York City's third largest trust. The collapse of the Knickerbocker spread fear throughout the city's trusts as regional banks withdrew reserves from New York City banks. Panic extended across the nation as vast numbers of people withdrew deposits from their regional banks.</p>
<p>The panic would have deepened if not for the intervention of <a href="J.P._Morgan" title="wikilink">J.P. Morgan</a>, who pledged large sums of his own money, and convinced other New York bankers to do the same, to shore up the banking system. At the time, the United States did not have a central bank to inject <a href="liquidity" class="uri" title="wikilink">liquidity</a> back into the market. By November the contagion had largely ended, yet a further crisis emerged when a large brokerage firm borrowed heavily using the stock of <a href="Tennessee_Coal,_Iron_and_Railroad_Company" title="wikilink">Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company</a> (TC&amp;I) as collateral. Collapse of TC&amp;I's stock price was averted by an emergency takeover approved by <a href="Trust-busting" title="wikilink">anti-monopoly crusading</a> president <a href="Theodore_Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Theodore Roosevelt</a>. The following year, Senator <a href="Nelson_W._Aldrich" title="wikilink">Nelson W. Aldrich</a> established and chaired a commission to investigate the crisis and propose future solutions, leading to the creation of the <a href="Federal_Reserve_System" title="wikilink">Federal Reserve System</a>.</p>

<p>The 1907 panic began with a stock manipulation scheme to <a href="cornering_the_market" title="wikilink">corner the market</a> in <a href="F._Augustus_Heinze" title="wikilink">F. Augustus Heinze</a>'s <a href="United_Copper" title="wikilink">United Copper Company</a>. Heinze had made a fortune as a copper magnate in <a href="Butte,_Montana" title="wikilink">Butte, Montana</a>, and in 1906 moved to New York City, where he formed a close relationship with a notorious <a href="Wall_Street" title="wikilink">Wall Street</a> banker <a href="Charles_W._Morse" title="wikilink">Charles W. Morse</a>. Morse had once successfully cornered New York City's ice market, and together with Heinze gained control of many banks&lt;U+2014&gt;the pair served on at least six national banks, 10 state banks, five trust companies and four insurance firms.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Curb_market.jpg" title="fig:The panic began in the vibrant marketplace for stocks that took place on the curb outside the New York Stock Exchange; this curb market later became the American Stock Exchange." alt="The panic began in the vibrant marketplace for stocks that took place on the curb outside the New York Stock Exchange; this curb market later became the American Stock Exchange." /> Augustus's brother, Otto, devised the scheme to corner United Copper, believing that the Heinze family already controlled a majority of the company. A significant number of the Heinze's <a href="Share_(finance)" title="wikilink">shares</a> had been borrowed, and Otto believed that many of these had been loaned to investors who hoped the stock price would drop, and they could thus replace the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference in a technique known as <a href="short_selling" title="wikilink">short selling</a>. Otto proposed a scheme called a &quot;bear squeeze&quot;, whereby the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the prices, and, unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>To finance the scheme, Otto, Augustus and Charles Morse met with <a href="Charles_T._Barney" title="wikilink">Charles T. Barney</a>, president of the city's third largest <a href="trust_company" title="wikilink">trust</a>, the <a href="Knickerbocker_Trust_Company" title="wikilink">Knickerbocker Trust Company</a>. Barney had provided financing for previous Morse schemes. Morse, however, cautioned Otto that he needed much more money than he had to attempt the squeeze and Barney declined to provide funding.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Otto decided to attempt the corner anyway. On Monday, October 14, he began aggressively purchasing shares of United Copper, which rose in one day to $52 per share from $39 per share. On Tuesday, he issued the call for short-sellers to give back the borrowed stock. Share prices rose to nearly $60, but the short-sellers were able to find plenty of United Copper shares from sources other than the Heinzes. Otto had misread the market, and the share price of United Copper began to collapse.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The stock closed at $30 on Tuesday and fell to $10 by Wednesday. Otto Heinze was ruined. The stock of United Copper was traded outside the hall of the <a href="New_York_Stock_Exchange" title="wikilink">New York Stock Exchange</a>, literally an outdoor market &quot;on the curb&quot; (this curb market would later become the <a href="American_Stock_Exchange" title="wikilink">American Stock Exchange</a>). After the crash, <em><a href="The_Wall_Street_Journal" title="wikilink">The Wall Street Journal</a></em> reported, &quot;Never has there been such wild scenes on the Curb, so say the oldest veterans of the outside market.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="contagion-spreads">Contagion spreads</h3>
<p>The failure of the corner left Otto unable to meet his obligations and sent his brokerage house, Gross &amp; Kleeberg, into bankruptcy. On Thursday, October 17, the New York Stock Exchange suspended Otto's trading privileges. As a result of United Copper's collapse, the State Savings Bank of Butte Montana (owned by F. Augustus Heinze) announced its insolvency. The Montana bank had held United Copper stock as <a href="Collateral_(finance)" title="wikilink">collateral</a> against some of its lending and had been a <a href="correspondent_bank" title="wikilink">correspondent bank</a> for the <a href="Mercantile_National_Bank" title="wikilink">Mercantile National Bank</a> in New York City, of which F. Augustus Heinze was then president.</p>
<p>F. Augustus Heinze's association with the corner and the insolvent State Savings Bank proved too much for the board of the Mercantile to accept. Although they forced him to resign before lunch time,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> by then it was too late. As news of the collapse spread, depositors rushed <em>en masse</em> to withdraw money from the Mercantile National Bank. The Mercantile had enough capital to withstand a few days of withdrawals, but depositors began to pull cash from the banks of the Heinzes' associate Charles W. Morse. Runs occurred at both the Morse's National Bank of North America and the New Amsterdam National. Afraid of the impact the tainted reputations of Augustus Heinze and Morse could have on the banking system, the <a href="New_York_Clearing_House" title="wikilink">New York Clearing House</a> (a consortium of the city's banks) forced Morse and Heinze to resign all banking interests.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> By the weekend after the failed corner, there was not yet systemic panic. Funds were withdrawn from Heinze-associated banks, only to be deposited with other banks in the city.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="panic-hits-the-trusts">Panic hits the trusts</h3>
<p>In the early 1900s, <a href="Trust_company" title="wikilink">trust companies</a> were booming; in the decade before 1907, their assets had grown by 244 percent. During the same period, national bank assets grew by 97 percent, while state banks in New York grew by 82 percent.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The leaders of the high-flying trusts were mainly prominent members of New York's financial and social circles. One of the most respected was <a href="Charles_T._Barney" title="wikilink">Charles T. Barney</a>, whose late father-in-law <a href="William_Collins_Whitney" title="wikilink">William Collins Whitney</a> was a famous financier. Barney's <a href="Knickerbocker_Trust_Company" title="wikilink">Knickerbocker Trust Company</a> was the third largest trust in New York.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>Because of past association with Charles W. Morse and F. Augustus Heinze, on Monday, October 21, the board of the Knickerbocker asked that Barney resign (depositors may have first begun to pull deposits from the Knickerbocker on October 18, prompting the concern<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a>). That day, the <a href="National_Bank_of_Commerce" title="wikilink">National Bank of Commerce</a> announced it would not serve as <a href="Clearing_house_(finance)" title="wikilink">clearing house</a> for the Knickerbocker. On October 22, the Knickerbocker faced a classic bank run. From the bank's opening, the crowd grew. As <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> reported, &quot;as fast as a depositor went out of the place ten people and more came asking for their money [and the police] were asked to send some men to keep order&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In less than three hours, $8 million was withdrawn from the Knickerbocker. Shortly after noon it was forced to suspend operations.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>As news spread, other banks and trust companies were reluctant to lend out any money. The interest rates on loans to brokers at the stock exchange soared and, with brokers unable to get money, stock prices fell to a low not seen since December of 1900.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The panic quickly spread to two other large trusts, Trust Company of America and Lincoln Trust Company. By Thursday, October 24, a chain of failures littered the street: Twelfth Ward Bank, Empire City Savings Bank, Hamilton Bank of New York, First National Bank of Brooklyn, International Trust Company of New York, Williamsburg Trust Company of Brooklyn, Borough Bank of Brooklyn, Jenkins Trust Company of Brooklyn and the Union Trust Company of Providence.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="enter-j.p.-morgan">Enter J.P. Morgan</h3>
<p>When the chaos began to shake the confidence of New York's banks, the city's most famous banker was out of town. <a href="J.P._Morgan" title="wikilink">J.P. Morgan</a>, president of the eponymous <a href="J.P._Morgan_&amp;_Co." title="wikilink">J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.</a>, was attending a church convention in <a href="Richmond,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Richmond, Virginia</a>. Morgan was not only the city's wealthiest and most well-connected banker, but he had experience with crisis&lt;U+2014&gt;he helped rescue the <a href="United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury" title="wikilink">U.S. Treasury</a> during the <a href="Panic_of_1893" title="wikilink">Panic of 1893</a>. As news of the crisis gathered, Morgan returned to Wall Street from his convention late on the night of Saturday, October 19. The following morning, the <a href="The_Morgan_Library_&amp;_Museum" title="wikilink">library</a> of Morgan's <a href="brownstone" class="uri" title="wikilink">brownstone</a> at Madison Avenue and 36th St. had become a revolving door of New York City bank and trust company presidents arriving to share information about (and seek help surviving) the impending crisis.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p>Morgan and his associates examined the books of the Knickerbocker Trust, but decided it was insolvent and did not intervene to stop the run. Its failure, however, triggered runs on even healthy trusts, prompting Morgan to take charge of the rescue operation. On the afternoon of Tuesday, October 22, the president of the Trust Company of America asked Morgan for assistance. That evening Morgan conferred with <a href="George_Fisher_Baker" title="wikilink">George F. Baker</a>, the president of First National Bank, <a href="James_Stillman" title="wikilink">James Stillman</a> of the National City Bank of New York (the ancestor of <a href="Citibank" class="uri" title="wikilink">Citibank</a>), and the <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury" title="wikilink">United States Secretary of the Treasury</a>, <a href="George_B._Cortelyou" title="wikilink">George B. Cortelyou</a>. Cortelyou said that he was ready to deposit government money in the banks to help shore up their deposits. After an overnight audit of the Trust Company of America showed the institution to be sound, on Wednesday afternoon Morgan declared, &lt;U+201C&gt;This is the place to stop the trouble, then.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>As a run began on the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to liquidate the company's assets to allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew that additional money would be needed to keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies and held them in a meeting until midnight when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America to stay open the next day.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> On Thursday morning Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> <a href="John_D._Rockefeller" title="wikilink">John D. Rockefeller</a>, the wealthiest man in America, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman's National City Bank.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Rockefeller's massive deposit left the National City Bank with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. To instill public confidence, Rockefeller phoned <a href="Melville_Elijah_Stone" title="wikilink">Melville Stone</a>, the manager of the <a href="Associated_Press" title="wikilink">Associated Press</a>, and told him that he would pledge half of his wealth to maintain America's credit.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="stock-exchange-nears-collapse">Stock exchange nears collapse</h3>
<p>Despite the infusion of cash, the banks of New York were reluctant to make the short-term loans they typically provided to facilitate daily stock trades. Unable to obtain these funds, prices on the exchange began to <a href="Stock_market_crash" title="wikilink">crash</a>. At 1:30 p.m. Thursday, October 24, Ransom Thomas, the president of the <a href="New_York_Stock_Exchange" title="wikilink">New York Stock Exchange</a>, rushed to Morgan's offices to tell him that he would have to close the exchange early. Morgan was emphatic that an early close of the exchange would be catastrophic.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Stockexchange.jpg" title="fig:Near panic broke on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in April 1907 when money reserves dried up." alt="Near panic broke on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in April 1907 when money reserves dried up." width="250" /> Morgan summoned the presidents of the city's banks to his office. They started to arrive at 2 p.m.; Morgan informed them that as many as 50 stock exchange houses would fail unless $25 million was raised in 10 minutes. By 2:16 p.m., 14 bank presidents had pledged $23.6 million to keep the stock exchange afloat. The money reached the market at 2:30 p.m., in time to finish the day's trading, and by the 3 o'clock market close, $19 million had been loaned out. Disaster was averted. Morgan usually eschewed the press, but as he left his offices that night he made a statement to reporters: &quot;If people will keep their money in the banks, everything will be all right.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Friday, however, saw more panic on the exchange. Morgan again approached the bank presidents, but this time was only able to convince them to pledge $9.7 million. In order for this money to keep the exchange open, Morgan decided the money could not be used for <a href="margin_(finance)" title="wikilink">margin sales</a>. The volume of trading on Friday was 2/3 that of Thursday. The markets again narrowly made it to the closing bell.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="crisis-of-confidence">Crisis of confidence</h3>
<p>Morgan, Stillman, Baker and the other city bankers were unable to pool money indefinitely. Even the U.S. Treasury was low on funds. Public confidence needed to be restored, and on Friday evening the bankers formed two committees&lt;U+2014&gt;one to persuade the clergy to calm their congregations on Sunday, and second to explain to the press the various aspects of the financial rescue package. Europe's most famous banker, <a href="Nathan_Rothschild,_1st_Baron_Rothschild" title="wikilink">Lord Rothschild</a>, sent word of his &quot;admiration and respect&quot; for Morgan.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In an attempt to gather confidence, the Treasury Secretary Cortelyou agreed that if he returned to Washington it would send a signal to Wall Street that the worst had passed.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>To ensure a free flow of funds on Monday, the New York Clearinghouse issued $100 million in loan certificates to be traded between banks to settle balances, allowing them to retain cash reserves for depositors.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Reassured both by the clergy and the newspapers, and with bank balance sheets flushed with cash, a sense of order returned to New York that Monday.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>Unbeknownst to Wall Street, a new crisis was being averted in the background. On Sunday, Morgan's associate, <a href="George_Walbridge_Perkins" title="wikilink">George Perkins</a>, was informed that the City of New York required at least $20 million by November 1 or it would go bankrupt. The city tried to raise money through a standard bond issue, but failed to gather enough financing. On Monday and again on Tuesday, <a href="Mayor_of_New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York Mayor</a> <a href="George_Brinton_McClellan,_Jr." title="wikilink">George McClellan</a> approached Morgan for assistance. In an effort to avoid the disastrous signal that a New York City bankruptcy would send, Morgan contracted to purchase $30 million worth of city bonds.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="calm-and-resolution">Calm and resolution</h3>
<p>Although calm was restored in New York by Saturday, November 2, yet another crisis loomed. One of the exchange's largest brokerage firms, Moore &amp; Schley, was heavily in debt and in danger of collapse. The firm had borrowed heavily, using stock from the <a href="Tennessee_Coal,_Iron_and_Railroad_Company" title="wikilink">Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company</a> (TC&amp;I) as collateral. Recent market difficulties meant there was little demand for TC&amp;I shares, and that not only would Moore &amp; Schley be unable to repay their creditors if the loans were called, but that the market would be flooded with TC&amp;I stock. Thus it was presumed bank failure would rapidly spread.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>If Monday morning's exchange opened with Moore &amp; Schley's fate still uncertain, fear would likely result in a massive crash. One obstacle remained: the <a href="anti-trust" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-trust</a> crusading President <a href="Theodore_Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, who had made breaking up <a href="monopoly" title="wikilink">monopolies</a> a focus of his presidency.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Morgan retained one ally that had not been tapped, the <a href="U.S._Steel_Corporation" title="wikilink">U.S. Steel Corporation</a>, a company Morgan had helped form through the merger of the steel companies of <a href="Andrew_Carnegie" title="wikilink">Andrew Carnegie</a> and <a href="Elbert_Henry_Gary" title="wikilink">Elbert Gary</a>. U.S. Steel had no involvement in banking, but could acquire TC&amp;I.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Morgan, Perkins, Baker and Stillman, along with U.S. Steel's Gary and <a href="Henry_Clay_Frick" title="wikilink">Henry Clay Frick</a> worked Saturday and Sunday arranging the terms and by Sunday night had a plan for acquisition.</p>
<p>Frick and Gary traveled overnight by train to the <a href="White_House" title="wikilink">White House</a> to implore Roosevelt to set aside the principles of the <a href="Sherman_Antitrust_Act" title="wikilink">Sherman Antitrust Act</a> and allow&lt;U+2014&gt;before the market opened&lt;U+2014&gt;a company that already had a 60 percent market share to make a massive acquisition. Roosevelt's secretary refused to see them, yet Frick and Gary convinced <a href="James_Rudolph_Garfield" title="wikilink">James Rudolph Garfield</a>, the <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_the_Interior" title="wikilink">Secretary of the Interior</a>, to bypass the secretary and allow them go directly to the president. With less than an hour before markets opened, Roosevelt and <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_State" title="wikilink">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Elihu_Root" title="wikilink">Elihu Root</a>, began to review the proposed takeover and absorb the news of a potential crash if the merger was not approved.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Roosevelt relented, and he later recalled of the meeting, &quot;It was necessary for me to decide on the instant before the Stock Exchange opened, for the situation in New York was such that any hour might be vital.

The market bottom of 53 was recorded on the close of November 15, 1907." width="300" /> The panic of 1907 occurred during a lengthy <a href="economic_contraction" title="wikilink">economic contraction</a>—measured by the <a href="National_Bureau_of_Economic_Research" title="wikilink">National Bureau of Economic Research</a> as occurring between May 1907 and June 1908.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> <a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The interrelated contraction, bank panic and falling stock market resulted in significant economic disruption. Robert Bruner and Sean Carr cite a number of statistics quantifying the damage in <em>The Panic of 1907: Lessons Learned from the Market's Perfect Storm</em>. Industrial production dropped further than after any bank run before then, while 1907 saw the second highest volume of bankruptcies to that date. Production fell by 11 percent, imports by 26 percent, while unemployment rose to 8 percent from under 3 percent. Immigration dropped to 750,000 people in 1909, from 1.2 million two years earlier.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>Since the end of the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a>, the United States had experienced panics of varying severity. Economists Charles Calomiris and Gary Gorton rate the worst panics as those leading to widespread bank suspensions&lt;U+2014&gt;the <a href="Panic_of_1873" title="wikilink">Panic of 1873</a>, <a href="Panic_of_1893" title="wikilink">Panic of 1893</a>, as well as 1907 and a suspension in 1914. Widespread suspensions were forestalled through coordinated actions during both the <a href="panic_of_1884" title="wikilink">1884</a> and the <a href="panic_of_1890" title="wikilink">1890</a> panics. A bank <a href="panic_of_1896" title="wikilink">crisis in 1896</a>, in which there was a perceived need for coordination, is also sometimes classified as a panic.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>The frequency of crises and the severity of the 1907 panic added to concern about the outsized role of J.P. Morgan which led to renewed impetus toward a national debate on reform.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> In May 1908, Congress passed the <a href="Aldrich-Vreeland_Act" title="wikilink">Aldrich&lt;U+2013&gt;Vreeland Act</a> which established the <a href="National_Monetary_Commission" title="wikilink">National Monetary Commission</a> to investigate the panic and to propose legislation to regulate banking.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Senator <a href="Nelson_Aldrich" title="wikilink">Nelson Aldrich</a> (<a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">R</a>&lt;U+2013&gt;<a href="Rhode_Island" title="wikilink">RI</a>), the chairman of the <a href="National_Monetary_Commission" title="wikilink">National Monetary Commission</a>, went to Europe for almost two years to study that continent's banking systems.</p>
<h3 id="central-bank">Central bank</h3>

<p>A significant difference between the European and U.S. banking systems was the absence of a <a href="central_bank" title="wikilink">central bank</a> in the United States. European states were able to extend the <a href="money_supply" title="wikilink">supply of money</a> during periods of low cash reserves. The belief that the U.S. economy was vulnerable without a central bank was not new. Early in 1907, <a href="Jacob_Schiff" title="wikilink">Jacob Schiff</a> of <a href="Kuhn,_Loeb_&amp;_Co." title="wikilink">Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.</a> warned in a speech to the New York Chamber of Commerce that, &quot;unless we have a central bank with adequate control of credit resources, this country is going to undergo the most severe and far reaching money panic in its history&quot;.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Aldrich convened a secret conference with a number of the nation's leading financiers at the <a href="Jekyll_Island_Club" title="wikilink">Jekyll Island Club</a>, off the coast of <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>, to discuss monetary policy and the banking system in November 1910.

<p><em><a href="Forbes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Forbes</a></em> magazine founder <a href="B._C._Forbes" title="wikilink">B. C. Forbes</a> wrote several years later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Picture a party of the nation&lt;U+2019&gt;s greatest bankers stealing out of New York on a private railroad car under cover of darkness, stealthily riding hundreds of miles South, embarking on a mysterious launch, sneaking onto an island deserted by all but a few servants, living there a full week under such rigid secrecy that the names of not one of them was once mentioned, lest the servants learn the identity and disclose to the world this strangest, most secret expedition in the history of American finance. I am not romancing; I am giving to the world, for the first time, the real story of how the famous Aldrich currency report, the foundation of our new currency system, was written.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The final report of the National Monetary Commission was published on January 11, 1911. For nearly two years legislators debated the proposal and it was not until December 22, 1913, that Congress passed the <a href="Federal_Reserve_Act" title="wikilink">Federal Reserve Act</a>. President <a href="Woodrow_Wilson" title="wikilink">Woodrow Wilson</a> signed the legislation immediately and the legislation was enacted on the same day, December 22, 1913, creating the <a href="Federal_Reserve_System" title="wikilink">Federal Reserve System</a>.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> <a href="Charles_Hamlin" title="wikilink">Charles Hamlin</a> became the Fed's first chairman, and none other than Morgan's deputy <a href="Benjamin_Strong" title="wikilink">Benjamin Strong</a> became president of the <a href="Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York" title="wikilink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a>, the most important regional bank with a permanent seat on the <a href="Federal_Open_Market_Committee" title="wikilink">Federal Open Market Committee</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p>Although Morgan was briefly seen as a hero, widespread fears concerning <a href="plutocracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">plutocracy</a> and concentrated wealth soon eroded this view. Morgan's bank had survived, but the trust companies that were a growing rival to traditional banks were badly damaged. Some analysts believed that the panic had been engineered to damage confidence in trust companies so that banks would benefit.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Others believed Morgan took advantage of the panic to allow his U.S. Steel company to acquire TC&amp;I.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> The significance of the role Morgan played in staving off worse disaster is undisputed, but he also became the focus of intense scrutiny and criticism.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>

The committee issued a scathing report on the banking trade, and found that the officers of <a href="J.P._Morgan_&amp;_Co." title="wikilink">J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.</a> also sat on the boards of directors of 112 corporations with a market capitalization of $22.5 billion (the total capitalization of the <a href="NYSE" class="uri" title="wikilink">NYSE</a> was then estimated at $26.5 billion).<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>Although suffering ill health, J.P. Morgan testified before the Pujo Committee and faced several days of questioning from <a href="Samuel_Untermyer" title="wikilink">Samuel Untermyer</a>. Untermyer and Morgan's famous exchange on the fundamentally psychological nature of banking&lt;U+2014&gt;that it is an industry built on trust&lt;U+2014&gt;is often quoted in business articles:<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> <poem></p>
<dl>

<dd><strong>Untermyer:</strong> Is not commercial credit based primarily upon money or property?
</dd>
<dd><strong>Morgan:</strong> No, sir. The first thing is character.
</dd>
<dd><strong>Untermyer:</strong> Before money or property?
</dd>
<dd><strong>Morgan:</strong> Before money or anything else. Money cannot buy it ... a man I do not trust could not get money from me on all the bonds in Christendom.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a>

<p></poem> Associates of Morgan blamed his continued physical decline on the hearings.
