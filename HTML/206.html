<p>__NOTOC__ </p>
<p>The <strong>Daimler D.I</strong> (also known by the company designation <strong>L6</strong>) was a German fighter aircraft of World War I. It was a conventional biplane design with a very small interplane gap - the top wing nearly touched the top of the fuselage. Power was provided by a <a href="Daimler_D.III" title="wikilink">Daimler D.III</a> engine. The L6 prototype won an <a href="Idflieg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Idflieg</a> competition for a new fighter design in 1918, but only six examples were built before the end of the war.</p>
