<p><strong>Frank Leroy Chance</strong> (September 9, 1876Â &lt;U+2013&gt; September 15, 1924) was an American <a href="professional_baseball" title="wikilink">professional baseball</a> player. A <a href="first_baseman" title="wikilink">first baseman</a>, Chance played in <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> for the <a href="Chicago_Cubs" title="wikilink">Chicago Cubs</a> (initially named the &quot;Orphans&quot;) and <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a> from 1898 through 1914. He also served as <a href="manager_(baseball)" title="wikilink">manager</a> of the Cubs, Yankees, and <a href="Boston_Red_Sox" title="wikilink">Boston Red Sox</a>.</p>
<p>Discovered by the Cubs as he played <a href="semi-professional" class="uri" title="wikilink">semi-professional</a> baseball while attending college, Chance debuted with the Cubs in 1898, serving as a part-time player. In 1903, Chance became the Cubs' regular first baseman, and in 1905, he succeeded <a href="Frank_Selee" title="wikilink">Frank Selee</a> as the team's manager. Chance led the Cubs to four <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> championships in the span of five years (1906&lt;U+2013&gt;1910) and won the <a href="World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a> championships in 1907 and 1908. With <a href="Joe_Tinker" title="wikilink">Joe Tinker</a> and <a href="Johnny_Evers" title="wikilink">Johnny Evers</a>, Chance formed a strong <a href="double_play" title="wikilink">double play</a> combination, which was immortalized as &quot;Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance&quot; in &quot;<a href="Baseball&#39;s_Sad_Lexicon" title="wikilink">Baseball's Sad Lexicon</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Let go by the Cubs after the 1912 season, Chance signed with the Yankees, serving as a player&lt;U+2013&gt;manager for two seasons. He joined the <a href="Los_Angeles_Angels" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Angels</a> of the <a href="Pacific_Coast_League" title="wikilink">Pacific Coast League</a> as a player&lt;U+2013&gt;manager, returning to MLB in 1923 as manager of the Red Sox. Chance was named the manager of the <a href="Chicago_White_Sox" title="wikilink">Chicago White Sox</a> in 1924, but never took control of the team as he became ill. He died later that year.</p>
<p>Noted for his leadership abilities, Chance earned the nickname &quot;Peerless Leader&quot;. He is the all-time leader in managerial <a href="winning_percentage" title="wikilink">winning percentage</a> in Cubs history. Chance was elected to the <a href="Baseball_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in the <a href="Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_balloting,_1946" title="wikilink">1946 balloting</a> by the <a href="Veterans_Committee" title="wikilink">Veterans Committee</a>, along with Tinker and Evers.</p>
