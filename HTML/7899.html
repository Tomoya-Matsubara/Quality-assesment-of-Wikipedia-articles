<p><strong>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien</strong>, <a href="Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">CBE</a> (3 January 1892 &lt;U+2013&gt; 2 September 1973), whose surname is pronounced  (in <a href="General_American" title="wikilink">General American</a> also ),<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> was an English writer, poet, <a href="Philology" title="wikilink">philologist</a>, and university professor, best known as the author of the classic <a href="high_fantasy" title="wikilink">high fantasy</a> works <em><a href="The_Hobbit" title="wikilink">The Hobbit</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, and <em><a href="The_Silmarillion" title="wikilink">The Silmarillion</a></em>.</p>
<p>Tolkien was <a href="Rawlinson_and_Bosworth_Professor_of_Anglo-Saxon" title="wikilink">Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon</a> at <a href="Oxford_University" title="wikilink">Oxford University</a> from 1925 to 1945 and <a href="Merton_Professors" title="wikilink">Merton Professor of English Language and Literature</a> there from 1945 to 1959.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He was a close friend of <a href="C._S._Lewis" title="wikilink">C. S. Lewis</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the <a href="Inklings" class="uri" title="wikilink">Inklings</a>. Tolkien was appointed a <a href="Commander_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> by Queen <a href="Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Elizabeth II</a> on 28 March 1972.</p>
<p>After his death, Tolkien's son <a href="Christopher_Tolkien" title="wikilink">Christopher</a> published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including <em>The Silmarillion</em>. These, together with <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about an imagined world called <a href="Arda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arda</a>, and <a href="Middle-earth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Middle-earth</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term <em><a href="legendarium" class="uri" title="wikilink">legendarium</a></em> to the larger part of these writings.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> the great success of <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> when they were published in paperback in the United States led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the &quot;father&quot; of modern fantasy literature<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>&lt;U+2014&gt;or, more precisely, of high fantasy.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Tolkien's writings have <a href="works_inspired_by_J._R._R._Tolkien" title="wikilink">inspired many other works of fantasy</a> and have had a lasting effect on the entire field.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In 2008, <em><a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">The Times</a></em> ranked him sixth on a list of &quot;The 50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <a href="Forbes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Forbes</a> ranked him the 5th top-earning dead celebrity in 2009.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> </p>

<h3 id="tolkien-family-origins">Tolkien family origins</h3>
<p>Most of Tolkien's paternal ancestors were craftsmen. The Tolkien family had its roots in <a href="Lower_Saxony" title="wikilink">Lower Saxony</a>, but had been living in England since the 18th century, becoming &quot;quickly intensely English&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The surname <em>Tolkien</em> is said to come from the <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German</a> word <em>tollk&lt;U+00FC&gt;hn</em><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> (&quot;foolhardy&quot;, etymologically corresponding to English <em>dull-keen</em>, literally <em><a href="oxymoron" class="uri" title="wikilink">oxymoron</a></em>), and the surname <em>Rashbold</em>, given to two characters in Tolkien's <em><a href="The_Notion_Club_Papers" title="wikilink">The Notion Club Papers</a></em>, is similarly a <a href="compound_word" title="wikilink">compound word</a> composed of two words with contrasting meanings.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> German writers have suggested that in reality the name is more likely to derive from the village Tolkynen in Rastenburg in <a href="East_Prussia" title="wikilink">East Prussia</a> (after WWII <a href="To&lt;U+0142&gt;kiny" class="uri" title="wikilink">To&lt;U+0142&gt;kiny</a>, Poland). The name of that place is derived from the now extinct <a href="Old_Prussian_language" title="wikilink">Old Prussian language</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Tolkien's maternal grandparents, John and Edith Jane Suffield, were <a href="Baptists" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baptists</a> who lived in <a href="Birmingham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Birmingham</a> and owned a shop in the city centre. The Suffield family had run various businesses out of the same building, called Lamb House, since the early 1800s. From 1810 Tolkien's great-great-grandfather William Suffield had a book and stationery shop there; from 1826 Tolkien's great-grandfather, also named John Suffield, had a <a href="drapery" class="uri" title="wikilink">drapery</a> and <a href="hosiery" class="uri" title="wikilink">hosiery</a> business there.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="childhood">Childhood</h3>
<p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in <a href="Bloemfontein" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bloemfontein</a> in the <a href="Orange_Free_State" title="wikilink">Orange Free State</a> (now <a href="Free_State_Province" title="wikilink">Free State Province</a>, part of South Africa) to <a href="Arthur_Tolkien" title="wikilink">Arthur Reuel Tolkien</a> (1857&lt;U+2013&gt;1896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, <em>n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</em> Suffield (1870&lt;U+2013&gt;1904). The couple had left England when Arthur was promoted to head the Bloemfontein office of the British bank for which he worked. Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, Hilary Arthur Reuel, who was born on 17 February 1894.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>As a child, Tolkien was bitten by a large <a href="baboon_spider" title="wikilink">baboon spider</a> in the garden, an event which some think would have later echoes in his stories, although Tolkien admitted no actual memory of the event and no special hatred of spiders as an adult. In another incident, a family house-boy, who thought Tolkien a beautiful child, took the baby to his <a href="kraal" class="uri" title="wikilink">kraal</a> to show him off, returning him the next morning.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>When he was three, Tolkien went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit. His father, however, died in South Africa of <a href="rheumatic_fever" title="wikilink">rheumatic fever</a> before he could join them.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> This left the family without an income, and so Tolkien's mother took him to live with her parents in <a href="Kings_Heath" title="wikilink">Kings Heath</a>,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Birmingham. Soon after, in 1896, they moved to <a href="Sarehole" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sarehole</a> (now in <a href="Hall_Green" title="wikilink">Hall Green</a>), then a <a href="Worcestershire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Worcestershire</a> village, later annexed to Birmingham.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> He enjoyed exploring <a href="Sarehole_Mill" title="wikilink">Sarehole Mill</a> and <a href="Moseley_Bog" title="wikilink">Moseley Bog</a> and the <a href="Clent_Hills" title="wikilink">Clent</a>, <a href="Lickey_Hills" title="wikilink">Lickey</a> and <a href="Malvern_Hills" title="wikilink">Malvern Hills</a>, which would later inspire scenes in his books, along with Worcestershire towns and villages such as <a href="Bromsgrove" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bromsgrove</a>, <a href="Alcester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alcester</a>, and <a href="Alvechurch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alvechurch</a> and places such as his aunt Jane's farm of Bag End, the name of which would be used in his fiction.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Mabel Tolkien herself taught her two sons, and Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen pupil.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> She taught him a great deal of <a href="botany" class="uri" title="wikilink">botany</a> and awakened in him the enjoyment of the look and feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> very early.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> He could read by the age of four and could write fluently soon afterwards. His mother allowed him to read many books. He disliked <em><a href="Treasure_Island" title="wikilink">Treasure Island</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Pied_Piper" title="wikilink">The Pied Piper</a></em> and thought <em><a href="Alice&#39;s_Adventures_in_Wonderland" title="wikilink">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a></em> by <a href="Lewis_Carroll" title="wikilink">Lewis Carroll</a> was &quot;amusing but disturbing&quot;. He liked stories about <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">&quot;Red Indians&quot;</a> and the fantasy works by <a href="George_MacDonald" title="wikilink">George MacDonald</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In addition, the &quot;Fairy Books&quot; of <a href="Andrew_Lang" title="wikilink">Andrew Lang</a> were particularly important to him and their influence is apparent in some of his later writings.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Tolkien attended <a href="King_Edward&#39;s_School,_Birmingham" title="wikilink">King Edward's School, Birmingham</a>, and later <a href="St._Philip&#39;s_School" title="wikilink">St. Philip's School</a>, before winning a Foundation Scholarship and returning to King Edward's School. While a pupil at King Edward's School, he was one of a party of cadets from the school's Officers Training Corps who helped &quot;line the route&quot; for the <a href="coronation" class="uri" title="wikilink">coronation</a> parade of King <a href="George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">George V</a>, being posted just outside the gates of <a href="Buckingham_Palace" title="wikilink">Buckingham Palace</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Mabel Tolkien was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1900 despite vehement protests by her Baptist family,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> who then stopped all financial assistance to her. In 1904, when Tolkien was 12, she died of acute <a href="diabetes" class="uri" title="wikilink">diabetes</a> at Fern Cottage in <a href="Rednal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rednal</a>, which she was then renting. Mabel Tolkien was then about 34 years of age, about as old as a person with <a href="diabetes_mellitus_type_1" title="wikilink">diabetes mellitus type 1</a> could live with no treatment&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="insulin" class="uri" title="wikilink">insulin</a> would not be discovered until two decades later. Nine years after his mother's death, Tolkien wrote, &quot;My own dear mother was a martyr indeed, and it is not to everybody that God grants so easy a way to his great gifts as he did to Hilary and myself, giving us a mother who killed herself with labour and trouble to ensure us keeping the faith.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Prior to her death, Mabel Tolkien had assigned the guardianship of her sons to Fr. Francis Xavier Morgan of the <a href="Birmingham_Oratory" title="wikilink">Birmingham Oratory</a>, who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics. Tolkien grew up in the <a href="Edgbaston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edgbaston</a> area of Birmingham. He lived there in the shadow of <a href="Perrott&#39;s_Folly" title="wikilink">Perrott's Folly</a> and the <a href="Victorian_architecture" title="wikilink">Victorian</a> tower of <a href="Edgbaston_Waterworks" title="wikilink">Edgbaston Waterworks</a>, which may have influenced the images of the dark towers within his works.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Another strong influence was the <a href="Romanticism" title="wikilink">romantic</a> medievalist paintings of <a href="Edward_Burne-Jones" title="wikilink">Edward Burne-Jones</a> and the <a href="Pre-Raphaelite_Brotherhood" title="wikilink">Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood</a>;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> the <a href="Birmingham_Museum_and_Art_Gallery" title="wikilink">Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery</a> has a large and world-renowned collection of works and had put it on free public display from around 1908.</p>

<p><img src="J._R._R._Tolkien_(1911).png" title="fig:Tolkien in 1911" alt="Tolkien in 1911" /> In 1911, while they were at <a href="King_Edward&#39;s_School,_Birmingham" title="wikilink">King Edward's School, Birmingham</a>, Tolkien and three friends, Rob Gilson, Geoffrey Smith, and Christopher Wiseman, formed a semi-secret society which they called &quot;the T.C.B.S.&quot;, the initials standing for &quot;Tea Club and Barrovian Society&quot;, alluding to their fondness for drinking tea in Barrow's Stores near the school and, secretly, in the school library.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> After leaving school, the members stayed in touch, and in December 1914 they held a &quot;Council&quot; in London, at Wiseman's home. For Tolkien, the result of this meeting was a strong dedication to writing poetry.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1911, Tolkien went on holiday in Switzerland, a trip that he recollects vividly in a 1968 letter,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> noting that <a href="Bilbo_Baggins" title="wikilink">Bilbo</a>'s journey across the <a href="Misty_Mountains" title="wikilink">Misty Mountains</a> (&quot;including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods&quot;) is directly based on his adventures as their party of 12 hiked from <a href="Interlaken" class="uri" title="wikilink">Interlaken</a> to <a href="Lauterbrunnen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lauterbrunnen</a> and on to camp in the <a href="moraine" title="wikilink">moraines</a> beyond <a href="M&lt;U+00FC&gt;rren" class="uri" title="wikilink">M&lt;U+00FC&gt;rren</a>. Fifty-seven years later, Tolkien remembered his regret at leaving the view of the eternal snows of <a href="Jungfrau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jungfrau</a> and <a href="Silberhorn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Silberhorn</a> (&quot;the Silvertine (<a href="Celebdil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Celebdil</a>) of my dreams&quot;). They went across the <a href="Kleine_Scheidegg" title="wikilink">Kleine Scheidegg</a> to <a href="Grindelwald" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grindelwald</a> and on across the <a href="Grosse_Scheidegg" title="wikilink">Grosse Scheidegg</a> to <a href="Meiringen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Meiringen</a>. They continued across the <a href="Grimsel_Pass" title="wikilink">Grimsel Pass</a>, through the upper <a href="Valais" class="uri" title="wikilink">Valais</a> to <a href="Brig,_Switzerland" title="wikilink">Brig</a> and on to the <a href="Aletsch_glacier" title="wikilink">Aletsch glacier</a> and <a href="Zermatt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zermatt</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>In October of the same year, Tolkien began studying at <a href="Exeter_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Exeter College, Oxford</a>. He initially studied <a href="Classics" class="uri" title="wikilink">Classics</a> but changed to <a href="English_Language" title="wikilink">English Language</a>, graduating in 1915.</p>
<h3 id="courtship-and-marriage">Courtship and marriage</h3>
<p>At the age of 16, Tolkien met <a href="Edith_Bratt" title="wikilink">Edith Mary Bratt</a>, who was three years older, when he and his brother Hilary moved into the boarding house in which she lived. According to Humphrey Carpenter:  His guardian, Father Francis Morgan, viewing Edith as a distraction from Tolkien's school work and horrified that his young charge was seriously involved with a <a href="Protestant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Protestant</a> girl, prohibited him from meeting, talking to, or even corresponding with her until he was 21. He obeyed this prohibition to the letter,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> with one notable early exception which made Father Morgan threaten to cut short his University career if he did not stop.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>On the evening of his twenty-first birthday, Tolkien wrote to Edith a declaration of his love and asked her to marry him. Edith replied saying that she had already agreed to marry another man, but that she had done so because she had believed Tolkien had forgotten her. The two met up and beneath a railway viaduct renewed their love; Edith returned her engagement ring and announced that she was marrying Tolkien instead.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Following their engagement Edith relunctantly announced that she was converting to Catholicism at Tolkien's insistence. Her landlord, a staunch <a href="Protestant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Protestant</a>, was infuriated and evicted her as soon as she was able to find other lodgings.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Edith and Ronald were formally engaged in Birmingham, in January 1913, and married at <a href="Warwick,_England" title="wikilink">Warwick</a>, England, at Saint Mary Immaculate Catholic Church on 22 March 1916.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="world-war-i">World War I</h3>
<p>In 1914, the United Kingdom entered <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> amidst an atmosphere of <a href="ultra-nationalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">ultra-nationalism</a>. As a result, Tolkien's relatives were shocked when he elected not to immediately volunteer for the <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a>. Instead, Tolkien entered a program wherein he delayed enlisting until completing his degree in July 1915. He was then commissioned as a <a href="Second_Lieutenant" title="wikilink">Second Lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Lancashire_Fusiliers" title="wikilink">Lancashire Fusiliers</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> He trained with the 13th (Reserve) Battalion on <a href="Cannock_Chase" title="wikilink">Cannock Chase</a>, <a href="Staffordshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Staffordshire</a>, for eleven months. In a letter to Edith, Tolkien complained, &quot;Gentlemen are rare among the superiors, and even human beings rare indeed.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Tolkien was then transferred to the 11th (Service) Battalion with the <a href="British_Expeditionary_Force_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">British Expeditionary Force</a>, arriving in France on 4 June 1916. His departure from England on a troop transport inspired him to write his poem, <em>The Lonely Isle</em>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> He later wrote, &quot;Junior officers were being killed off, a dozen a minute. Parting from my wife then ... it was like a death.&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Tolkien served as a signals officer at the <a href="Battle_of_the_Somme_(1916)" title="wikilink">Somme</a>, participating in the <a href="Battle_of_Thiepval_Ridge" title="wikilink">Battle of Thiepval Ridge</a> and the subsequent assault on the <a href="Schwaben_Redoubt" title="wikilink">Schwaben Redoubt</a>. According to John Garth, however:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although <a href="Herbert_Kitchener,_1st_Earl_Kitchener" title="wikilink">Kitchener</a>'s army enshrined old social boundaries, it also chipped away at the class divide by throwing men from all walks of life into a desperate situation together. Tolkien wrote that the experience taught him, 'a deep sympathy and feeling for the <a href="Tommy_Atkins" title="wikilink">Tommy</a>; especially the plain soldier from the agricultural counties.' He remained profoundly grateful for the lesson. For a long time, he had been imprisoned in a tower, not of pearl, but of ivory.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tolkien's time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared that every knock on the door might carry news of her husband's death. In order to get around the <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a>'s <a href="postal_censorship" title="wikilink">postal censorship</a>, the Tolkiens had developed a secret code which accompanied his letters home. By using the code, Edith was able to track her husband's movements on a map of the <a href="Western_Front_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">Western Front</a>.</p>
<p>On 27 October 1916 Tolkien came down with <a href="trench_fever" title="wikilink">trench fever</a>, a disease carried by the <a href="lice" class="uri" title="wikilink">lice</a> which were common in the dugouts. According to the memoirs of the Reverend Mervyn S. Evers, <a href="Anglican" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglican</a> chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers: </p>
<p>Tolkien was invalided to England on 8 November 1916.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Many of his dearest school friends, including Gilson and Smith of the T.C.B.S., were killed in the war. In later years, Tolkien indignantly declared that those who searched his works for parallels to the Second World War were entirely mistaken: </p>
<h4 id="homefront">Homefront</h4>
<p>A weak and emaciated Tolkien spent the remainder of the war alternating between hospitals and garrison duties, being deemed medically unfit for general service.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>During his recovery in a cottage in <a href="Great_Haywood" title="wikilink">Great Haywood</a>, <a href="Staffordshire,_England" title="wikilink">Staffordshire</a>, he began to work on what he called <em><a href="The_Book_of_Lost_Tales" title="wikilink">The Book of Lost Tales</a></em>, beginning with <em><a href="The_Fall_of_Gondolin" title="wikilink">The Fall of Gondolin</a></em>. Throughout 1917 and 1918 his illness kept recurring, but he had recovered enough to do home service at various camps and was promoted to <a href="Lieutenant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lieutenant</a>. It was at this time that Edith bore their first child, John Francis Reuel Tolkien.</p>
<p>When he was stationed at <a href="Kingston_upon_Hull" title="wikilink">Kingston upon Hull</a>, he and Edith went walking in the woods at nearby <a href="Roos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Roos</a>, and Edith began to dance for him in a clearing among the flowering hemlock. After his wife's death in 1971, Tolkien remembered,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I never called Edith <em>Luthien</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; but she was the source of the story that in time became the chief part of the <em>Silmarillion</em>. It was first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> at Roos in Yorkshire (where I was for a brief time in command of an outpost of the Humber Garrison in 1917, and she was able to live with me for a while). In those days her hair was raven, her skin clear, her eyes brighter than you have seen them, and she could sing &lt;U+2013&gt; and <em>dance</em>. But the story has gone crooked, &amp; I am left, and <em>I</em> cannot plead before the inexorable <a href="Mandos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mandos</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tolkien's first civilian job after World War I was at the <em><a href="Oxford_English_Dictionary" title="wikilink">Oxford English Dictionary</a></em>, where he worked mainly on the history and etymology of words of Germanic origin beginning with the letter <em>W</em>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> In 1920 he took up a post as <a href="Reader_(academic_rank)" title="wikilink">Reader</a> in English Language at the <a href="University_of_Leeds" title="wikilink">University of Leeds</a>, and became the youngest professor there.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> While at Leeds he produced <em>A Middle English Vocabulary</em> and, with <a href="E._V._Gordon" title="wikilink">E.

<p>During his time at Pembroke, Tolkien wrote <em><a href="The_Hobbit" title="wikilink">The Hobbit</a></em> and the first two volumes of <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, whilst living at 20 <a href="Northmoor_Road" title="wikilink">Northmoor Road</a> in <a href="North_Oxford" title="wikilink">North Oxford</a> (where a <a href="blue_plaque" title="wikilink">blue plaque</a> was placed in 2002).

<h4 id="beowulf"><em>Beowulf</em></h4>
<p>Of Tolkien's academic publications, the 1936 lecture &quot;<a href="Beowulf:_The_Monsters_and_the_Critics" title="wikilink">Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics</a>&quot; had a lasting influence on <em><a href="Beowulf" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beowulf</a></em> research.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Lewis E. Nicholson said that the article Tolkien wrote about <em>Beowulf</em> is &quot;widely recognized as a turning point in Beowulfian criticism&quot;, noting that Tolkien established the primacy of the poetic nature of the work as opposed to its purely linguistic elements.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> At the time, the consensus of scholarship deprecated <em>Beowulf</em> for dealing with childish battles with monsters rather than realistic tribal warfare; Tolkien argued that the author of <em>Beowulf</em> was addressing human destiny in general, not as limited by particular tribal politics, and therefore the monsters were essential to the poem.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Where <em>Beowulf</em> does deal with specific tribal struggles, as at <a href="Finnsburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Finnsburg</a>, Tolkien argued firmly against reading in fantastic elements.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> In the essay, Tolkien also revealed how highly he regarded Beowulf: &quot;Beowulf is among my most valued sources,&quot; and this influence may be seen throughout his <a href="Middle-Earth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Middle-Earth</a> <a href="legendarium" class="uri" title="wikilink">legendarium</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>According to <a href="Humphrey_Carpenter" title="wikilink">Humphrey Carpenter</a>, Tolkien had an ingenious means of beginning his series of lectures on <em>Beowulf</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He would come silently into the room, fix the audience with his gaze, and suddenly begin to declaim in a resounding voice the opening lines of the poem in the original Anglo-Saxon, commencing with a great cry of <em>Hw&lt;U+00E6&gt;t!</em> (The first word of this and several other Old English poems), which some undergraduates took to be 'Quiet!' It was not so much a recitation as a dramatic performance, an impersonation of an Anglo-Saxon bard in a mead hall, and it impressed generations of students because it brought home to them that <em>Beowulf</em> was not just a set text to be read for the purposes of examination, but a powerful piece of dramatic poetry.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>More than a quarter century after his death, Tolkien's handwritten translation of and commentary on <em>Beowulf</em>, running to roughly 2000 pages, was discovered in the archives of the <a href="Bodleian_Library" title="wikilink">Bodleian Library</a>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="world-war-ii">World War II</h4>
<p>In the run-up to <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, Tolkien was earmarked as a <a href="Cryptanalysis" title="wikilink">codebreaker</a>.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> In January 1939, he was asked whether he would be prepared to serve in the <a href="Cryptography" title="wikilink">cryptographical</a> department of the Foreign Office in the event of national emergency.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> He replied in the affirmative and, beginning on 27 March, took an instructional course at the London HQ of the <a href="Government_Code_and_Cypher_School" title="wikilink">Government Code and Cypher School</a>.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> However, although he was &quot;keen&quot;<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> to become a codebreaker, he was informed in October that his services would not be required at that time.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Ultimately he never served as one.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> In 2009, <em><a href="The_Daily_Telegraph" title="wikilink">The Daily Telegraph</a></em> claimed Tolkien turned down a &lt;U+00A3&gt;500-a-year offer to become a full-time recruit for unknown reasons.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1945, Tolkien moved to <a href="Merton_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Merton College, Oxford</a>, becoming the <a href="Merton_Professors" title="wikilink">Merton Professor of English Language and Literature</a>,<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> in which post he remained until his retirement in 1959. He served as an external examiner for <a href="University_College,_Dublin" title="wikilink">University College, Dublin</a>, for many years. In 1954 Tolkien received an honorary degree from the National University of Ireland (of which U.C.D. was a constituent college). Tolkien completed <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> in 1948, close to a decade after the first sketches.</p>
<p>Tolkien also helped to translate the <em><a href="Jerusalem_Bible" title="wikilink">Jerusalem Bible</a></em>, which was published in 1966.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="family">Family</h3>
<p>The Tolkiens had four children: John Francis Reuel Tolkien (17 November 1917 &lt;U+2013&gt; 22 January 2003), Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien (22 October 1920 &lt;U+2013&gt; 27 February 1984), <a href="Christopher_Tolkien" title="wikilink">Christopher John Reuel Tolkien</a> (born 21 November 1924) and Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien (born 18 June 1929). Tolkien was very devoted to his children and sent them illustrated <a href="The_Father_Christmas_Letters" title="wikilink">letters from Father Christmas</a> when they were young. Each year more characters were added, such as the Polar Bear (Father Christmas's helper), the Snow Man (his gardener), Ilbereth the elf (his secretary), and various other, minor characters. The major characters would relate tales of Father Christmas's battles against <a href="goblin" title="wikilink">goblins</a> who rode on bats and the various pranks committed by the Polar Bear.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="friendships">Friendships</h3>
<h4 id="c.-s.-lewis">C. S. Lewis</h4>
<p><a href="C._S._Lewis" title="wikilink">C. S. Lewis</a>, whom Tolkien first met at Oxford, was perhaps his closest friend and colleague, although their relationship cooled later in their lives. They had a shared affection for good talk, laughter, and beer, and in May 1927 Tolkien enrolled Lewis in the &quot;Coalbiters&quot;,<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> a club which read Icelandic sagas in the original <a href="Old_Norse" title="wikilink">Old Norse</a>. As a result, &quot;a long and complex friendship had begun.&quot; It was Tolkien and <a href="Hugo_Dyson" title="wikilink">Hugo Dyson</a> who persuaded Lewis convert to Christianity from Atheism, and Tolkien was accustomed to read aloud passages from his Silmarillion mythology, <em>The Hobbit</em>, and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> while Lewis listened.</p>
<p>Tolkien later recalled,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The unpayable debt I owe to him was not 'influence' as it is ordinarily understood, but sheer encouragement. He was for long my only audience. Only from him did I ever get the idea that my 'stuff' could be more than a private hobby.&quot;<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lewis's growing reputation as a Christian apologist and his return to the Anglicanism of his childhood seriously bothered Tolkien. After Lewis published the story of his conversion under the title, <a href="The_Pilgrim&#39;s_Regress" title="wikilink">The Pilgrim's Regress</a>, Tolkien complained,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Lewis would regress. He would not enter Christianity by a new door, but by the old one: at least in the sense that in taking it up again he would also take up again, or reawaken, the prejudices so sedulously planted in childhood and boyhood. He would become again a <a href="Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland</a> protestant.&quot;<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the mid-<a href="1940s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1940s</a>, Tolkien felt that Lewis was receiving, &quot;too much [publicity] for his or any of our tastes&quot;.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>It was the arrival of <a href="Charles_Williams_(UK_writer)" title="wikilink">Charles Williams</a>, who worked for Oxford University Press, that changed the relationship between Tolkien and Lewis. Lewis's enthusiasm shifted almost imperceptibly from Tolkien to Williams, especially during the writing of Lewis's third novel <em><a href="That_Hideous_Strength" title="wikilink">That Hideous Strength</a></em>.</p>
<p>However, Lewis's skepticism over the <a href="Second_Spanish_Republic" title="wikilink">Second Spanish Republic</a>'s <a href="Anti-Catholic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anti-Catholic</a> <a href="pogrom" title="wikilink">pogroms</a> seriously offended Tolkien. In a 1944 letter to his son Christopher, he wrote: </p>
<p>According to <a href="Humphrey_Carpenter" title="wikilink">Humphrey Carpenter</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...he and Lewis might conceivably have preserved something of their old friendship had not Tolkien been puzzled and even angered by Lewis' marriage to <a href="Joy_Davidman" title="wikilink">Joy Davidman</a>, which lasted from 1957 to her death in 1960. Some of his feelings might be explained by the fact that she had been divorced from her previous husband before she married Lewis, some by resentment of Lewis' expectation that his friends should pay court to his new wife -- whereas in the thirties Lewis, very much the bachelor, had liked to ignore the fact that his friends had wives to go home to. But there was more to it than that. It was almost as if Tolkien felt betrayed by the marriage, resented the intrusion of a woman into his friendship with Lewis -- just as Edith had resented Lewis' intrusion into her marriage. Ironically, it was Edith who became friends with Joy Davidman.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> In a 1964 letter, Tolkien described the marriage as &quot;very strange&quot;.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>The cessation of Tolkien's frequent meetings with Lewis in the 1950s marked the end of the &quot;clubbable&quot; chapter in Tolkien's life, which started with the T.C.B.S. at school and ended with the Inklings at Oxford.</p>
<p>His friendship with Lewis was nevertheless renewed to some degree in later years. During Lewis' last illness, Tolkien approached his friend's stepson, <a href="Douglas_Gresham" title="wikilink">Douglas Gresham</a>, and offered him a place to stay. After Lewis's death in November 1963, Tolkien wrote to his daughter Priscilla: &quot;So far I have felt the normal feelings of a man of my age&lt;U+2014&gt;like an old tree that is losing all its leaves one by one: this feels like an axe-blow near the roots.&quot;<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="w.-h.-auden">W. H. Auden</h4>
<p><a href="W._H._Auden" title="wikilink">W. H. Auden</a>, who had spent much of his life as an avowed <a href="Marxist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marxist</a>, began corresponding with Tolkien during the mid-1950s. By this time, Auden had broken with his former beliefs and returned to the Anglicanism of his childhood. They remained close friends for the remainder of Tolkien's life. In one letter, Auden recalled,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I don't think I have ever told you what an unforgettable experience it was for me as an undergraduate, hearing you recite <a href="Beowulf" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beowulf</a>.

</blockquote>
<p>In addition, Auden was among the most prominent literary critics to praise <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. Tolkien wrote in a 1971 letter: </p>
<h4 id="roy-campbell">Roy Campbell</h4>
<p>At a meeting of the Inklings in October 1944, Tolkien met and was charmed by the <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South African</a> poet and Roman Catholic convert <a href="Roy_Campbell_(poet)" title="wikilink">Roy Campbell</a>, who had been discharged from the <a href="King&#39;s_African_Rifles" title="wikilink">King's African Rifles</a> after being severely injured in a motorcycle accident.

<p>In Campbell's eyes, the Spanish Civil War was an uncomplicated battle between the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic Church</a> and <a href="Stalinism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stalinism</a>. Tolkien, who shared his opinion, admiringly compared Campbell to the Ranger <a href="Aragorn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aragorn</a> from his <a href="Middle_Earth" title="wikilink">Middle Earth</a> <a href="legendarium" class="uri" title="wikilink">legendarium</a>. C. S.

<h3 id="retirement-and-old-age">Retirement and old age</h3>
<p>During his life in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973, Tolkien received steadily increasing public attention and literary fame. The sales of his books were so profitable that he regretted he had not chosen early retirement.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> While at first he wrote enthusiastic answers to readers' enquiries, he became more and more bothered by the emerging <a href="Tolkien_fandom" title="wikilink">Tolkien fandom</a>, especially among the <a href="hippie" class="uri" title="wikilink">hippie</a> movement in the United States.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> In a 1972 letter he deplored having become a <a href="Tolkien_fandom" title="wikilink">cult-figure</a>, but admitted that &quot;even the nose of a very modest idol [...] cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense!&quot;<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>

<p>Fan attention became so intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number out of the public directory<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> and eventually he and Edith moved to <a href="Bournemouth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bournemouth</a>, which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper class. Although Tolkien's status as a bestselling author gave them easy entry into polite society, Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow intellectuals. Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which was the reason Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place.</p>
<p>According to <a href="Humphrey_Carpenter" title="wikilink">Humphrey Carpenter</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those friends who knew Ronald and Edith Tolkien over the years never doubted that there was deep affection between them. It was visible in the small things, the almost absurd degree in which each worried about the other's health, and the care in which they chose and wrapped each other's birthday presents'; and in the large matters, the way in which Ronald willingly abandoned such a large part of his life in retirement to give Edith the last years in <a href="Bournemouth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bournemouth</a> that he felt she deserved, and the degree in which she showed pride in his fame as an author. A principal source of happiness to them was their shared love of their family. This bound them together until the end of their lives, and it was perhaps the strongest force in the marriage. They delighted to discuss and mull over every detail of the lives of their children, and later their grandchildren.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="views">Views</h2>
<p>Tolkien was a devout Roman Catholic, and in his religious and political views he was mostly conservative, in the sense of favouring established conventions and orthodoxies over innovation and modernization; in 1943 he wrote, &quot;My political opinions lean more and more to <a href="Anarchy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anarchy</a> (<a href="philosophical_anarchism" title="wikilink">philosophically understood</a>, meaning abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs)&lt;U+2014&gt;or to 'unconstitutional' <a href="monarchism" title="wikilink">Monarchy</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p>Tolkien had an intense dislike for the side effects of <a href="industrialization" class="uri" title="wikilink">industrialization</a>, which he considered to be devouring the English countryside. For most of his adult life, he was disdainful of <a href="cars" class="uri" title="wikilink">cars</a>, preferring to ride a bicycle.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> This attitude can be seen in his work, most famously in the portrayal of the forced &quot;industrialization&quot; of the <a href="Shire_(Middle-earth)" title="wikilink">Shire</a> in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>Many commentators<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> have remarked on a number of potential parallels between the Middle-earth saga and events in Tolkien's lifetime. <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> is often thought to represent England during and immediately after World War II. Tolkien ardently rejected this opinion in the foreword to the second edition of the novel, stating he preferred applicability to allegory.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> This theme is taken up at greater length in his essay &quot;<a href="On_Fairy-Stories" title="wikilink">On Fairy-Stories</a>&quot;, where he argues that fairy-stories are so apt because they are consistent both within themselves and with some truths about reality. He concludes that Christianity itself follows this pattern of inner consistency and external truth. His belief in the fundamental truths of Christianity leads commentators to find Christian themes in <em>The Lord of the Rings.</em> Tolkien objected strongly to C. S. Lewis's use of religious references in his stories, which were often overtly allegorical.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> However, Tolkien wrote that the Mount Doom scene exemplified lines from the <a href="Lord&#39;s_Prayer" title="wikilink">Lord's Prayer</a>.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<p>His love of myths and his devout faith came together in his assertion that he believed that <a href="mythology" class="uri" title="wikilink">mythology</a> is the divine echo of &quot;the Truth&quot;.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> This view was expressed in his poem <em><a href="Mythopoeia_(poem)" title="wikilink">Mythopoeia</a></em>,<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> and his idea that myths held &quot;fundamental truths&quot; became a central theme of the <a href="Inklings" class="uri" title="wikilink">Inklings</a> in general.</p>
<h3 id="religion">Religion</h3>
<p>Tolkien's devout faith was a significant factor in the conversion of <a href="C._S._Lewis" title="wikilink">C. S.

<p>In the last years of his life, Tolkien became greatly <a href="Traditionalist_Catholic" title="wikilink">disappointed</a> by the reforms and changes implemented after the <a href="Second_Vatican_Council" title="wikilink">Second Vatican Council</a>,<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> as his grandson <a href="Simon_Tolkien" title="wikilink">Simon Tolkien</a> recalls:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I vividly remember going to church with him in <a href="Bournemouth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bournemouth</a>. He was a devout Roman Catholic and it was soon after the Church had changed the <a href="liturgy" class="uri" title="wikilink">liturgy</a> from Latin to English. My grandfather obviously didn't agree with this and made all the responses very loudly in Latin while the rest of the congregation answered in English.

<p>At a time when many Western writers and intellectuals openly admired <a href="Stalin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stalin</a>, Tolkien made no effort to hide his contempt for the <a href="dictator" class="uri" title="wikilink">dictator</a> of the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>. Even during World War II, when Britain was allied with the <a href="USSR" class="uri" title="wikilink">USSR</a>, Tolkien referred to Stalin as &quot;that bloodthirsty old murderer&quot;<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> and expressed hope that the Americans would overthrow him after Hitler's defeat.</p>
<p>However, in 1961, Tolkien sharply criticized a Swedish commentator who suggested that <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> was an anti-communist <a href="parable" class="uri" title="wikilink">parable</a> and identified the Dark Lord with Stalin.

<h4 id="debate-over-race">Debate over race</h4>
<p>The question of <a href="racism" title="wikilink">racist</a> or <a href="racialism" title="wikilink">racialist</a> elements in Tolkien's views and works has been the matter of some scholarly debate.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> Christine Chism<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> distinguishes accusations as falling into three categories: intentional racism,<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> unconscious <a href="Eurocentric" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eurocentric</a> bias, and an evolution from latent racism in Tolkien's early work to a conscious rejection of racist tendencies in his late work.</p>
<p>Tolkien expressed disgust at what he acknowledged as racism and once wrote of <a href="South_Africa_under_apartheid" title="wikilink">racial segregation</a> in South Africa, &quot;The treatment of colour nearly always horrifies anyone going out from Britain.&quot;<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a></p>

To Tolkien's outrage, he was asked beforehand whether he was of <a href="Aryan_race" title="wikilink">Aryan</a> origin. In a letter to his British publisher <a href="Stanley_Unwin_(publisher)" title="wikilink">Stanley Unwin</a>, he condemned <a href="Nazism" title="wikilink">Nazi</a> &quot;race-doctrine&quot; and <a href="Antisemitism" title="wikilink">anti-Semitism</a> as &quot;wholly pernicious and unscientific&quot;. He added that he had many Jewish friends and was considering, &quot;letting a German translation go hang&quot;.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> He provided two letters to R&lt;U+00FC&gt;tten &amp; Loening and instructed Unwin to send whichever he preferred. The more tactful letter was sent and was lost during the later bombing of Germany. In the unsent letter, Tolkien makes the point that &quot;Aryan&quot; is a linguistic term, denoting speakers of <a href="Indo-Iranian_languages" title="wikilink">Indo-Iranian languages</a>. He continued,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of <em>Jewish</em> origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have <em>no</em> ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the eighteenth century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject&lt;U+2014&gt;which should be sufficient. I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army. I cannot, however, forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, he expressed his resentment at the distortion of Germanic history in &quot;Nordicism&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... that ruddy little ignoramus Adolf Hitler ... Ruining, perverting, misapplying, and making for ever accursed, that noble northern spirit, a supreme contribution to Europe, which I have ever loved, and tried to present in its true light. Nowhere, incidentally, was it nobler than in England, nor more early sanctified and Christianized.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1968, he objected to a description of Middle-earth as &quot;<a href="Nordic_race" title="wikilink">Nordic</a>&quot;, a term he said he disliked because of its association with <a href="Nordic_theory" title="wikilink">racialist theories</a>.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We were supposed to have reached a stage of civilization in which it might still be necessary to execute a criminal, but not to gloat, or to hang his wife and child by him while the orc-crowd hooted. The destruction of Germany, be it 100 times merited, is one of the most appalling world-catastrophes. Well, well,&lt;U+2014&gt;you and I can do nothing about it. And that [should] be a measure of the amount of guilt that can justly be assumed to attach to any member of a country who is not a member of its actual Government.

</blockquote>
<p>He also reacted with anger at the excesses of <a href="Anti-German_sentiment" title="wikilink">anti-German</a> propaganda during the war. In 1944, he wrote in a letter to his son Christopher:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... it is distressing to see the press grovelling in the gutter as low as <a href="Joseph_Goebbels" title="wikilink">Goebbels</a> in his prime, shrieking that any German commander who holds out in a desperate situation (when, too, the military needs of his side clearly benefit) is a drunkard, and a besotted fanatic. ... There was a solemn article in the local paper seriously advocating systematic exterminating of the entire German nation as the only proper course after military victory: because, if you please, they are <a href="rattlesnake" title="wikilink">rattlesnakes</a>, and don't know the difference between good and evil!

<p><a href="Edward_Wyke-Smith" title="wikilink">Edward Wyke-Smith</a>'s <em>The Marvellous Land of Snergs</em>, with its &quot;table-high&quot; title characters, strongly influenced the incidents, themes, and depiction of Bilbo's race in <em>The Hobbit</em>.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>
<p>Tolkien also cited <a href="Henry_Rider_Haggard" title="wikilink">H.

Critics have compared this device to the <em>Testament of Isildur</em> in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em><a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> and to Tolkien's efforts to produce as an illustration a realistic page from the <em><a href="Book_of_Mazarbul" title="wikilink">Book of Mazarbul</a>.</em><a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> Critics starting with <a href="Edwin_Muir" title="wikilink">Edwin Muir</a><a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> have found resemblances between Haggard's romances and Tolkien's.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a><a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a><a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>
<p>Tolkien wrote of being impressed as a boy by <a href="Samuel_Rutherford_Crockett" title="wikilink">S. R.

<h4 id="european-mythology">European mythology</h4>
<p>Tolkien was much inspired by early <a href="Germanic_peoples" title="wikilink">Germanic</a>, especially <a href="Anglo-Saxons" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon</a> literature, <a href="Germanic_poetry" title="wikilink">poetry</a>, and <a href="Germanic_paganism" title="wikilink">mythology</a>, which were his chosen and much-loved areas of expertise. These sources of inspiration included <a href="Anglo-Saxon_literature" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon literature</a> such as <em><a href="Beowulf" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beowulf</a></em>, <a href="Saga" title="wikilink">Norse sagas</a> such as the <em><a href="Volsunga_saga" title="wikilink">Volsunga saga</a></em> and the <em><a href="Hervarar_saga" title="wikilink">Hervarar saga</a></em>,<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> the <em><a href="Poetic_Edda" title="wikilink">Poetic Edda</a></em>, the <em><a href="Prose_Edda" title="wikilink">Prose Edda</a></em>, the <em><a href="Nibelungenlied" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nibelungenlied</a></em>, and numerous other culturally related works.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> Despite the similarities of his work to the <em>Volsunga saga</em> and the <em>Nibelungenlied</em>, which were the basis for <a href="Richard_Wagner" title="wikilink">Richard Wagner</a>'s opera cycle <em><a href="Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen" title="wikilink">Der Ring des Nibelungen</a></em>, Tolkien dismissed critics' direct comparisons to Wagner, telling his publisher, &quot;Both rings were round, and there the resemblance ceases.&quot; However, some critics<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a><a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a><a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> believe that Tolkien was, in fact, indebted to Wagner for elements such as the &quot;concept of the Ring as giving the owner mastery of the world ...&quot;<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> Two of the characteristics possessed by the One Ring, its inherent malevolence and corrupting power upon minds and wills, were not present in the mythical sources but have a central role in Wagner's opera.</p>

<h4 id="beowulf-the-monsters-and-the-critics"><em>Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics</em></h4>
<p>As well as his fiction, Tolkien was also a leading author of academic literary criticism. His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic <em><a href="Beowulf" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beowulf</a></em> by literary critics. The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day. <em>Beowulf</em> is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details of both <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> being adapted from the poem. The piece reveals many of the aspects of <em>Beowulf</em> which Tolkien found most inspiring, most prominently the role of monsters in literature, particularly that of the dragon which appears in the final third of the poem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for the poem, one dragon, however hot, does not make a summer, or a host; and a man might well exchange for one good dragon what he would not sell for a wilderness. And dragons, real dragons, essential both to the machinery and the ideas of a poem or tale, are actually rare.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="the-silmarillion"><em>The Silmarillion</em></h4>
<p>Tolkien wrote a brief &quot;Sketch of the Mythology&quot; which included the tales of Beren and L&lt;U+00FA&gt;thien and of T&lt;U+00FA&gt;rin, and that sketch eventually evolved into the <em><a href="Quenta_Silmarillion" title="wikilink">Quenta Silmarillion</a></em>, an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published. Tolkien desperately hoped to publish it along with <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, but publishers (both <a href="Allen_&amp;_Unwin" title="wikilink">Allen &amp; Unwin</a> and <a href="HarperCollins" title="wikilink">Collins</a>) got cold feet. Moreover, printing costs were very high in <a href="1950s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1950s</a> Britain, requiring <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> to be published in three volumes.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> The story of this continuous redrafting is told in the posthumous series <em><a href="The_History_of_Middle-earth" title="wikilink">The History of Middle-earth</a></em>, edited by Tolkien's son, <a href="Christopher_Tolkien" title="wikilink">Christopher Tolkien</a>.

Other stories included <em><a href="Mr._Bliss" title="wikilink">Mr. Bliss</a></em> and <em><a href="Roverandom" class="uri" title="wikilink">Roverandom</a></em> (for children), and <em><a href="Leaf_by_Niggle" title="wikilink">Leaf by Niggle</a></em> (part of <em><a href="Tree_and_Leaf" title="wikilink">Tree and Leaf</a></em>), <em><a href="The_Adventures_of_Tom_Bombadil" title="wikilink">The Adventures of Tom Bombadil</a></em>, <em><a href="On_Fairy-Stories" title="wikilink">On Fairy-Stories</a></em>, <em><a href="Smith_of_Wootton_Major" title="wikilink">Smith of Wootton Major</a></em> and <em><a href="Farmer_Giles_of_Ham" title="wikilink">Farmer Giles of Ham</a></em>. <em>Roverandom</em> and <em>Smith of Wootton Major</em>, like <em><a href="The_Hobbit" title="wikilink">The Hobbit</a></em>, borrowed ideas from his <em>legendarium</em>.</p>
<h4 id="the-hobbit"><em>The Hobbit</em></h4>
<p>Tolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called <em><a href="The_Hobbit" title="wikilink">The Hobbit</a></em>, which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm George Allen &amp; Unwin, who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> However, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel.</p>
<h4 id="the-lord-of-the-rings"><em>The Lord of the Rings</em></h4>
<p>Even though he felt uninspired, the request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic novel <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> (originally published in three volumes 1954&lt;U+2013&gt;1955). Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, during which time he received the constant support of the <a href="Inklings" class="uri" title="wikilink">Inklings</a>, in particular his closest friend Lewis, the author of <em><a href="The_Chronicles_of_Narnia" title="wikilink">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em>. Both <em><a href="The_Hobbit" title="wikilink">The Hobbit</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> are set against the background of <em><a href="The_Silmarillion" title="wikilink">The Silmarillion</a></em>, but in a time long after it.</p>
<p>Tolkien at first intended <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> to be a children's tale in the style of <em>The Hobbit</em>, but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> Though a direct sequel to <em>The Hobbit</em>, it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense <a href="back_story" title="wikilink">back story</a> of <a href="Beleriand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beleriand</a> that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in <em><a href="The_Silmarillion" title="wikilink">The Silmarillion</a></em> and other volumes. Tolkien's influence weighs heavily on the <a href="fantasy_fiction" title="wikilink">fantasy</a> genre that grew up after the success of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.</p>
<p><em>The Lord of the Rings</em> became immensely popular in the 1960s and has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the 20th century, judged by both sales and reader surveys.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> In the 2003 &quot;<a href="Big_Read" title="wikilink">Big Read</a>&quot; survey conducted by the BBC, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> was found to be the &quot;Nation's Best-loved Book&quot;.

<p>Tolkien had appointed his son <a href="Christopher_Tolkien" title="wikilink">Christopher</a> to be his <a href="literary_executor" title="wikilink">literary executor</a>, and he (with assistance from <a href="Guy_Gavriel_Kay" title="wikilink">Guy Gavriel Kay</a>, later a well-known fantasy author in his own right) organized some of his father's unpublished material into a single coherent volume, published as <em><a href="The_Silmarillion" title="wikilink">The Silmarillion</a></em> in <a href="1977_in_literature" title="wikilink">1977</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;his father had previously attempted to get a collection of &quot;Silmarillion&quot; material published in 1937 before writing <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a></p>

<p>In <a href="1980_in_literature" title="wikilink">1980</a> Christopher Tolkien published a collection of more fragmentary material, under the title <em><a href="Unfinished_Tales" title="wikilink">Unfinished Tales of N&lt;U+00FA&gt;menor and Middle-earth</a></em>. In subsequent years (<a href="1983_in_literature" title="wikilink">1983</a>&lt;U+2013&gt;<a href="1996_in_literature" title="wikilink">1996</a>) he published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called <em><a href="The_History_of_Middle-earth" title="wikilink">The History of Middle-earth</a></em>. They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and <em>The Hobbit</em>, the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing <em>The Hobbit</em> for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="the-children-of-hu00farin"><em>The Children of H&lt;U+00FA&gt;rin</em></h4>
<p>More recently, in 2007, the collection was completed with the publication of <em><a href="The_Children_of_H&lt;U+00FA&gt;rin" title="wikilink">The Children of H&lt;U+00FA&gt;rin</a></em> by <a href="HarperCollins" class="uri" title="wikilink">HarperCollins</a> (in the UK and Canada) and <a href="Houghton_Mifflin" title="wikilink">Houghton Mifflin</a> (in the US).

<p>In February 2009, <em><a href="Publishers_Weekly" title="wikilink">Publishers Weekly</a></em> announced that <a href="Houghton_Mifflin_Harcourt" title="wikilink">Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</a> had acquired the American rights to Tolkien's unpublished work <em><a href="The_Legend_of_Sigurd_and_Gudr&lt;U+00FA&gt;n" title="wikilink">The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr&lt;U+00FA&gt;n</a></em>.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> The work, which was released worldwide on 5 May 2009 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and HarperCollins, retells the legend of <a href="Sigurd" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sigurd</a> and the fall of the <a href="Niflungs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Niflungs</a> from Germanic mythology.

<p>According to Christopher Tolkien, it is no longer possible to trace the exact date of the work's composition. On the basis of circumstantial evidence, he suggests that it dates from the 1930s. In his foreword he wrote, &quot;He scarely ever (to my knowledge) referred to them. For my part, I cannot recall any conversation with him on the subject until very near the end of his life, when he spoke of them to me, and tried unsuccessfully to find them.&quot;<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> In a 1967 letter to <a href="W._H._Auden" title="wikilink">W.

<h4 id="mr.-bliss"><em>Mr. Bliss</em></h4>
<p>One of Tolkien's least-known short works, published in 1982, it tells the story of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of <em>The Hobbit</em>. The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he didn't have time to do so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien's difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each facing page.</p>

<h2 id="languages-and-philology">Languages and philology</h2>
<h3 id="linguistic-career">Linguistic career</h3>
<p>Both Tolkien's academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and <a href="philology" class="uri" title="wikilink">philology</a>. He specialized in English philology at university and in 1915 graduated with <a href="Old_Norse" title="wikilink">Old Norse</a> as special subject. He worked for the <a href="Oxford_English_Dictionary" title="wikilink">Oxford English Dictionary</a> from 1918 and is credited with having worked on a number of words starting with the letter W, including <a href="walrus" class="uri" title="wikilink">walrus</a>, over which he struggled mightily.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> In 1920, he became Reader in English Language at the <a href="University_of_Leeds" title="wikilink">University of Leeds</a>, where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of <a href="linguistics" class="uri" title="wikilink">linguistics</a> from five to twenty. He gave courses in <a href="Old_English" title="wikilink">Old English</a> <a href="heroic_verse" title="wikilink">heroic verse</a>, <a href="history_of_English" title="wikilink">history of English</a>, various <a href="Old_English" title="wikilink">Old English</a> and <a href="Middle_English" title="wikilink">Middle English</a> texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory <a href="Germanic_languages" title="wikilink">Germanic</a> philology, <a href="Gothic_language" title="wikilink">Gothic</a>, <a href="Old_Icelandic" title="wikilink">Old Icelandic</a>, and <a href="Middle_Welsh_language" title="wikilink">Medieval Welsh</a>. When in 1925, aged thirty-three, Tolkien applied for the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon at the Pembroke College, he boasted that his students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a &quot;<a href="Viking_revival" title="wikilink">Viking Club</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> He also had a certain, if imperfect, knowledge of Finnish.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a></p>
<p>Privately, Tolkien was attracted to &quot;things of <a href="Race_(classification_of_human_beings)" title="wikilink">racial</a> and linguistic significance&quot;, and in his 1955 lecture <em><a href="English_and_Welsh" title="wikilink">English and Welsh</a></em>, which is crucial to his understanding of race and language, he entertained notions of &quot;inherent linguistic predilections&quot;, which he termed the &quot;native language&quot; as opposed to the &quot;cradle-tongue&quot; which a person first learns to speak.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> He considered the <a href="West_Midlands_(region)" title="wikilink">West Midlands</a> dialect of <a href="Middle_English" title="wikilink">Middle English</a> to be his own &quot;native language&quot;, and, as he wrote to <a href="W._H._Auden" title="wikilink">W. H. Auden</a> in 1955, &quot;I am a West-midlander by blood (and took to early west-midland Middle English as a known tongue as soon as I set eyes on it).&quot;<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a></p>
<p>Tolkien learned <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a>, French, and German from his mother, and while at school he learned <a href="Middle_English" title="wikilink">Middle English</a>, <a href="Old_English" title="wikilink">Old English</a>, Finnish, <a href="Gothic_language" title="wikilink">Gothic</a>, Greek, Italian, <a href="Old_Norse" title="wikilink">Old Norse</a>, Spanish, Welsh, and <a href="Medieval_Welsh" title="wikilink">Medieval Welsh</a>. He was also familiar with Danish, Dutch, <a href="Lombardic_language" title="wikilink">Lombardic</a>, Norwegian, Icelandic, Russian, Swedish, <a href="Middle_Dutch" title="wikilink">Middle Dutch</a>, <a href="Middle_High_German" title="wikilink">Middle High German</a>, <a href="Middle_Low_German" title="wikilink">Middle Low German</a>, <a href="Old_High_German" title="wikilink">Old High German</a>, <a href="Proto-Slavic_language" title="wikilink">Old Slavonic</a>, and <a href="Lithuanian_language" title="wikilink">Lithuanian</a>,<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> revealing his deep linguistic knowledge, above all of the <a href="Germanic_languages" title="wikilink">Germanic languages</a>.</p>
<h3 id="language-construction">Language construction</h3>

<p>Parallel to Tolkien's professional work as a philologist, and sometimes overshadowing this work, to the effect that his academic output remained rather thin, was his affection for the construction of <a href="artificial_language" title="wikilink">artificial languages</a>. The best developed of these are <a href="Quenya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quenya</a> and <a href="Sindarin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sindarin</a>, the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien's <em>legendarium</em>. Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of <a href="aesthetics" class="uri" title="wikilink">aesthetics</a> and <a href="euphony" class="uri" title="wikilink">euphony</a>, and Quenya in particular was designed from &quot;phonaesthetic&quot; considerations; it was intended as an &quot;Elvenlatin&quot;, and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from Finnish, Welsh, English, and Greek.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> A notable addition came in late 1945 with <a href="Ad&lt;U+00FB&gt;naic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ad&lt;U+00FB&gt;naic</a> or <a href="N&lt;U+00FA&gt;men&lt;U+00F3&gt;rean" class="uri" title="wikilink">N&lt;U+00FA&gt;men&lt;U+00F3&gt;rean</a>, a language of a &quot;faintly <a href="Semitic_languages" title="wikilink">Semitic</a> flavour&quot;, connected with Tolkien's <a href="Atlantis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Atlantis</a> legend, which by <em><a href="The_Notion_Club_Papers" title="wikilink">The Notion Club Papers</a></em> ties directly into his ideas about inability of language to be inherited, and via the &quot;<a href="Second_Age" title="wikilink">Second Age</a>&quot; and the story of <a href="E&lt;U+00E4&gt;rendil" class="uri" title="wikilink">E&lt;U+00E4&gt;rendil</a> was grounded in the <em>legendarium</em>, thereby providing a link of Tolkien's twentieth-century &quot;real primary world&quot; with the legendary past of his Middle-earth.</p>
<p>Tolkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them, and he consequently took a dim view of <a href="International_auxiliary_language" title="wikilink">auxiliary languages</a>: in 1930 a congress of Esperantists were told as much by him, in his lecture <em><a href="A_Secret_Vice" title="wikilink">A Secret Vice</a></em>, &quot;Your language construction will breed a mythology&quot;, but by 1956 he had concluded that &quot;<a href="Volap&lt;U+00FC&gt;k" class="uri" title="wikilink">Volap&lt;U+00FC&gt;k</a>, <a href="Esperanto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Esperanto</a>, <a href="Ido" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ido</a>, <a href="Novial" class="uri" title="wikilink">Novial</a>, &amp;c, &amp;c, are dead, far deader than ancient unused languages, because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends&quot;.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>
<p>The popularity of Tolkien's books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's idiosyncratic spellings <em>dwarves</em> and <em>dwarvish</em> (alongside <em>dwarfs</em> and <em>dwarfish</em>), which had been little used since the mid-1800s and earlier. (In fact, according to Tolkien, had the <a href="Old_English" title="wikilink">Old English</a> plural survived, it would have been <em>dwerrow</em>.) He also coined the term <em><a href="eucatastrophe" class="uri" title="wikilink">eucatastrophe</a></em>, though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work.</p>
<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>

<h3 id="adaptations">Adaptations</h3>

<p>In a 1951 letter to Milton Waldman, Tolkien wrote about his intentions to create a &quot;body of more or less connected legend&quot;, of which &quot;[t]he cycles should be linked to a majestic whole, and yet leave scope for other minds and hands, wielding paint and music and drama&quot;.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> The hands and minds of many artists have indeed been inspired by Tolkien's legends. Personally known to him were <a href="Pauline_Baynes" title="wikilink">Pauline Baynes</a> (Tolkien's favourite illustrator of <em><a href="The_Adventures_of_Tom_Bombadil" title="wikilink">The Adventures of Tom Bombadil</a></em> and <em><a href="Farmer_Giles_of_Ham" title="wikilink">Farmer Giles of Ham</a></em>) and <a href="Donald_Swann" title="wikilink">Donald Swann</a> (who set the music to <em><a href="The_Road_Goes_Ever_On" title="wikilink">The Road Goes Ever On</a></em>). Queen <a href="Margrethe_II_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Margrethe II of Denmark</a> created illustrations to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> in the early 1970s. She sent them to Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity they bore in style to his own drawings.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a></p>
<p>However, Tolkien was not fond of all the artistic representation of his works that were produced in his lifetime, and was sometimes harshly disapproving. In 1946, he rejected suggestions for illustrations by Horus Engels for the German edition of <em>The Hobbit</em> as &quot;too <a href="The_Walt_Disney_Company" title="wikilink">Disnified</a> ... Bilbo with a dribbling nose, and Gandalf as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the <a href="Odin" title="wikilink">Odinic</a> wanderer that I think of&quot;.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a></p>
<p>Tolkien was sceptical of the emerging <a href="Tolkien_fandom" title="wikilink">Tolkien fandom</a> in the United States, and in 1954 he returned proposals for the dust jackets of the American edition of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>: </p>
<p>He had dismissed dramatic representations of fantasy in his essay &quot;<a href="On_Fairy-Stories" title="wikilink">On Fairy-Stories</a>&quot;, first presented in 1939: </p>
<p>On receiving a <a href="screenplay" class="uri" title="wikilink">screenplay</a> for a proposed movie adaptation of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> by Morton Grady Zimmerman, Tolkien wrote: </p>
<p>Tolkien went on to criticize the script scene by scene (&quot;yet one more scene of screams and rather meaningless slashings&quot;). He was not implacably opposed to the idea of a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> to <a href="United_Artists" title="wikilink">United Artists</a> in 1968.
