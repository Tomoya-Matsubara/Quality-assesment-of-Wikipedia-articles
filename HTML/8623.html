<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The channel 27 frequency in Roanoke was originally home to <strong>WROV-TV</strong>, which operated from late <a href="1952" class="uri" title="wikilink">1952</a> until early <a href="1953" class="uri" title="wikilink">1953</a>. It was the first UHF station in the country to go dark after less than three months on the air. Southwest <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a> is very mountainous and the difficulties faced by UHF stations at the time were magnified by the area's rugged terrain. Its facilities were eventually sold to the Times-World Corporation to launch its new station, <a href="WDBJ-TV" class="uri" title="wikilink">WDBJ-TV</a> in <a href="1955" class="uri" title="wikilink">1955</a>.</p>
<p>Also appearing on the channel 27 frequency was <strong>WRFT</strong>, which was known to have broadcasted from the early 1960s to <a href="1974" class="uri" title="wikilink">1974</a> as an <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC</a> affiliate. At the time, the area's primary ABC affiliate, WLVA-TV in Lynchburg (now <a href="WSET-TV" class="uri" title="wikilink">WSET-TV</a>), provided only marginal coverage of Roanoke.</p>
<p>The current incarnation of channel 27 debuted on <a href="July_11" title="wikilink">July 11</a>, <a href="1981" class="uri" title="wikilink">1981</a> as religious station <strong>WVFT-TV</strong> (<strong>V</strong>ictory <strong>F</strong>aith <strong>T</strong>elevision). It was the first non-network station to sign on in the Roanoke / Lynchburg market as well as the first new commercial station in the area since WDBJ signed on 26 years earlier. On <a href="June_5" title="wikilink">June 5</a>, <a href="1983" class="uri" title="wikilink">1983</a>, WVFT became the area's first full-service independent station. It lost its license in <a href="1984" class="uri" title="wikilink">1984</a> (for reasons that are unknown to this day), but was sold to new owners later in the year. The FCC licensed it as a new station, retaining the WVFT calls.</p>
<p>In <a href="1984" class="uri" title="wikilink">1984</a>, Jefferson-Pilot Communications (now <a href="Lincoln_Financial_Media" title="wikilink">Lincoln Financial Media</a>) launched <strong>WJPR</strong> as an independent station on channel 21, with the callsign meaning <strong>J</strong>efferson <strong>P</strong>ilot <strong>R</strong>adio. In <a href="1986" class="uri" title="wikilink">1986</a>, WJPR became a charter <a href="FOX" class="uri" title="wikilink">FOX</a> affiliate.</p>
<p>On <a href="September_15" title="wikilink">September 15</a>, <a href="1993" class="uri" title="wikilink">1993</a>, Milt Grant bought WJPR and WVFT, and began airing the same programming on both stations with WVFT serving as the main station. Although channel 21 decently covers Roanoke, it doesn't provide a strong signal to the <a href="New_River_Valley" title="wikilink">New River Valley</a> (despite its 4.1 million-watt ERP). The two stations provide a strong combined signal with 60% overlap. In <a href="October" class="uri" title="wikilink">October</a> of <a href="1993" class="uri" title="wikilink">1993</a>, WVFT was renamed <strong>WFXR-TV</strong>.</p>
<p>In <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a>, Fox 21/27 approached <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a> affiliate <a href="WSLS-TV" class="uri" title="wikilink">WSLS-TV</a> on the topic of a &quot;news sharing agreement&quot;. The deal would allow WSLS to produce a 10 PM newscast for Fox 21/27. They had originally approached <a href="CBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">CBS</a> affiliate WDBJ with a similar idea, but nothing came of it. &quot;The FOX 10 O'Clock News&quot; with Frances Scott and John Carlin premiered on <a href="October_28" title="wikilink">October 28</a>, 1996 as the market's first primetime newscast.</p>
<p>On <a href="June_30" title="wikilink">June 30</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, the call letters of WJPR were changed to <strong>WWCW</strong>. The new call letters matched the new affiliation agreement with <a href="The_CW" title="wikilink">The CW</a>, which appear on both station's DT2 digital subchannel (see below). FOX will continue to be on both WFXR and WWCW, with both analog and digital signals. This drew the ire of some people who were used to the WJPR calls, as well as of those who think the WWCW calls should only be used if that station's analog channel is a CW affiliate as well. At present, Grant has no plans to split off the two stations and make channel 21 solely a CW station.</p>
<h2 id="wbva-tv-wb-5">&quot;WBVA-TV&quot; &quot;WB 5&quot;</h2>
<p>WFXB &amp; WWCW operated the area's cable-only <a href="The_WB" title="wikilink">WB</a> affiliate known by the fictional calls of <strong>&quot;WBVA-TV&quot;</strong>. It was offered on Cox cable channel 5 and as a result was known on-air as &quot;WB 5&quot;. When WFXB &amp; WWCW's digital signals signed on in <a href="April" class="uri" title="wikilink">April</a> of <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a>, WBVA was added to their DT2 digital subchannels. The WB afiliate was also offered on <a href="DirecTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">DirecTV</a> and <a href="Dish_Network" title="wikilink">Dish Network</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="January_24" title="wikilink">January 24</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, the <a href="UPN" class="uri" title="wikilink">UPN</a> and WB networks announced that they would end broadcasting and merge. The newly combined network would be called <strong>The CW</strong>, the letters representing the first initial of its corporate parents CBS (the parent company of UPN) and the <a href="Warner_Bros." title="wikilink">Warner Bros.</a> unit of <a href="Time_Warner" title="wikilink">Time Warner</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="March_28" title="wikilink">March 28</a>, 2006, it was announced that WBVA would become the area's CW affiliate. To reflect this, the fictional WBVA calls were changed to <strong>&quot;WCW5-TV&quot;</strong> in <a href="June" class="uri" title="wikilink">June</a> of 2006. The CW began broadcasting on <a href="September_18" title="wikilink">September 18</a>, 2006 which is when the affiliate changed its branding to &quot;CW 5&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="newscasts">Newscasts</h2>
<p>WFXR &amp; WWCW's daily 10 PM newscast is produced by the area's NBC affiliate <a href="WSLS" class="uri" title="wikilink">WSLS</a>. This is a result of a news share agreement between the stations. The newscast is simulcasted on &quot;CW 5&quot;. Whenever FOX programming or sports delays the broadcast of the 10 PM newscasts on WFXR &amp; WWCW, it is aired on &quot;CW 5&quot;.</p>
