<p>The <strong>Temple of Eshmun</strong> () dedicated to <a href="Eshmun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eshmun</a>, the <a href="Phoenecian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phoenecian</a> god of healing, is situated by the <a href="Awali_(river)" title="wikilink">Awali river</a>,  northeast of <a href="Sidon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sidon</a> in southwestern <a href="Lebanon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lebanon</a>. The site was occupied from the 7th century BCE to the 8th century CE, suggesting an integrated relationship with the nearby city of Sidon. Although originally constructed by Sidonian king <a href="Eshmunazar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eshmunazar</a> II in the <a href="Achaemenid_Empire" title="wikilink">Achaemenid era</a> ( 529&lt;U+2013&gt;333 BCE) to celebrate the city's recovered wealth and stature, the temple complex was greatly expanded by Bodashtart, Yatan-milk and later monarchs. Due to the expansion works spanning many centuries of alternating independence and foreign <a href="hegemony" class="uri" title="wikilink">hegemony</a>, the sanctuary features a wealth of different architectural and decorative styles and influences.</p>
<p>The sanctuary consists of an <a href="esplanade" class="uri" title="wikilink">esplanade</a> and a grand court limited by a huge <a href="limestone" class="uri" title="wikilink">limestone</a> terrace wall that supports a monumental <a href="podium" class="uri" title="wikilink">podium</a> which was once topped by Eshmun's Graeco-Persian style <a href="marble" class="uri" title="wikilink">marble</a> temple. The sanctuary features a series of ritual <a href="Ritual_purification" title="wikilink">ablution</a> basins fed by canals channeling water from the Asclepius river (modern <a href="Awali_(river)" title="wikilink">Awali</a>) and from the sacred &quot;Ydll&quot; spring;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> these installations were used for therapeutic and purificatory purposes that characterize the cult of Eshmun. The sanctuary site has yielded many artifacts of value, especially those inscribed with <a href="Phoenician_alphabet" title="wikilink">Phoenician texts</a>, providing valuable insight into the site's history and that of ancient Sidon.</p>
<p>The Eshmun Temple declined and fell into oblivion as <a href="paganism" class="uri" title="wikilink">paganism</a> was overrun by <a href="Early_Christianity" title="wikilink">Christianity</a> and its large limestone blocks were used to build later structures. The temple site was rediscovered in 1900 by local <a href="Treasure_hunting" title="wikilink">treasure hunters</a> who stirred the curiosity of international scholars. Maurice Dunand, a French archaeologist, thoroughly excavated the site from 1963 until the beginning of the <a href="Lebanese_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Lebanese Civil War</a> in 1975. After the end of the hostilities and the retreat of <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a> from <a href="South_Lebanon" title="wikilink">South Lebanon</a>, the site was rehabilitated and inscribed to the <a href="World_Heritage_Site" title="wikilink">World Heritage Site</a> tentative list.</p>
<h2 id="eshmun">Eshmun</h2>

<p>Eshmun was the Phoenician god of healing and renewal of life; he was one of the most important divinities of the Phoenician <a href="Pantheon_(gods)" title="wikilink">pantheon</a> and the main male divinity of <a href="Sidon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sidon</a>. Originally a nature divinity, and a god of spring vegetation, Eshmun was equated to <a href="Babylonian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Babylonian</a> deity <a href="Tammuz_(deity)" title="wikilink">Tammuz</a>. His role later expanded within the Phoenician pantheon, and he gained celestial and cosmic attributes.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The myth of Eshmun was related by the 6th century CE <a href="Syria" title="wikilink">Syrian</a> <a href="Neoplatonism" title="wikilink">philosopher</a> <a href="Damascius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Damascius</a> and 9th century CE <a href="Ecumenical_Patriarch_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">Patriarch</a> of <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a> <a href="Photios_I_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">Photius</a>. They recount that Eshmun, a young man from <a href="Beirut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beirut</a>, was hunting in the woods when <a href="Astarte" class="uri" title="wikilink">Astarte</a> saw him and was stricken by his beauty. She harassed him with her amorous pursuit until he <a href="Emasculation" title="wikilink">emasculated</a> himself with an <a href="axe" class="uri" title="wikilink">axe</a> and died. The grieving goddess revived Eshmun and transported him to the heavens where she made him into a <a href="Heaven" title="wikilink">uranic</a> god.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>From a historical perspective, the first written mention of Eshmun goes back to 754 BCE, the date of the signing of the treaty between <a href="Assyria" title="wikilink">Assyrian</a> king <a href="Ashur-nirari_V" title="wikilink">Ashur-nirari V</a> and Mati'el, king of <a href="Arpad_(Syria)" title="wikilink">Arpad</a>; Eshmun figures in the text as a patron of the treaty.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Eshmun was identified with <a href="Asclepius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asclepius</a> as a result of the <a href="Hellenistic_civilization" title="wikilink">Hellenic</a> influence over Phoenicia; the earliest evidence of this equation is given by coins from <a href="Amrit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amrit</a> and <a href="Acre,_Israel" title="wikilink">Acre</a> from the 3rd century BCE. This fact is exemplified by the Hellenized names of the <a href="Awali_(river)" title="wikilink">Awali</a> river which was dubbed <em>Asclepius fluvius</em>, and the Eshmun Temple&lt;U+2019&gt;s surrounding groves, known as the groves of Asclepius.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>In the 9th century BCE, the <a href="Assyria" title="wikilink">Assyrian</a> king <a href="Ashurnasirpal_II" title="wikilink">Ashurnasirpal II</a> conquered <a href="Mount_Lebanon" title="wikilink">the Lebanon</a> mountain range and its coastal cities. The new sovereigns exacted tribute from Sidon, along with every other <a href="Phoenicia" title="wikilink">Phoenician</a> city. These payments stimulated Sidon&lt;U+2019&gt;s search for new means of provisioning and furthered Phoenician emigration and expansion, which peaked in the 8th century BCE.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> When Assyrian king <a href="Sargon_II" title="wikilink">Sargon II</a> died in 705 BCE, the Sidonian king <a href="Luli" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luli</a> joined with the <a href="Ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">Egyptians</a> and <a href="Kingdom_of_Judah" title="wikilink">Judah</a> in an unsuccessful rebellion against Assyrian rule,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> but was forced to flee to <a href="Kition" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kition</a> (modern <a href="Larnaca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Larnaca</a> in <a href="Cyprus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cyprus</a>) with the arrival of the Assyrian army headed by <a href="Sennacherib" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sennacherib</a>, Sargon II's son and successor. Sennacherib instated <a href="Ittobaal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ittobaal</a> on the throne of Sidon and reimposed the annual tribute.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> When <a href="Abdi-Milkutti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Abdi-Milkutti</a> ascended to Sidon's throne in 680, he also rebelled against the Assyrians.

Abdi-Milkutti was captured and beheaded in 677 BCE after a three-year siege, while his city was destroyed and renamed Kar-Ashur-aha-iddina (the harbor of Esarhaddon). Sidon was stripped of its territory, which was awarded to <a href="Baal_I" title="wikilink">Baal I</a>, the king of rival <a href="Tyre,_Lebanon" title="wikilink">Tyre</a> and loyal <a href="vassal" class="uri" title="wikilink">vassal</a> to Esarhaddon.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Baal I and Esarhaddon signed a <a href="treaty" class="uri" title="wikilink">treaty</a> in 675 in which Eshmun&lt;U+2019&gt;s name features as one of the deities invoked as guarantors of the covenant.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>Sidon returned to its former level of prosperity while Tyre was besieged for 13 years (586&lt;U+2013&gt;573 BCE) by the <a href="Chaldea" title="wikilink">Chaldean</a> king <a href="Nebuchadnezzar_II" title="wikilink">Nebuchadnezzar II</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Nevertheless, the Sidonian king was still held in exile at the court of <a href="Babylon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Babylon</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Sidon reclaimed its former standing as Phoenicia&lt;U+2019&gt;s chief city in the <a href="Achaemenid_Empire" title="wikilink">Achaemenid era</a> ( 529&lt;U+2013&gt;333 BCE).

<p>The first hit to the Eshmun sanctuary was by an earthquake in the 4th century BCE, which demolished the marble temple atop the podium; this structure was not rebuilt but many chapels and temples were later annexed at the base of the podium.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The temple site remained a place of pilgrimage in the <a href="Ancient_history" title="wikilink">ancient world</a> until the advent of <a href="Christianity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christianity</a>, when the cult of Eshmun was banned and a <a href="Christian_church" title="wikilink">Christian church</a> was built at the temple site across the <a href="Roman_roads" title="wikilink">Roman street</a> from the podium.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Remnants and mosaic floors of the <a href="Byzantine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Byzantine</a> church can still be seen on the site.

It is  long by  wide and  tall.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a><a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Unearthed in 1963 by Maurice Dunand, it stands on a <a href="limestone" class="uri" title="wikilink">limestone</a> <a href="Socle_(architecture)" title="wikilink">socle</a> plated with marble blocks that rest against a retaining wall .<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The altar is adorned with <a href="Hellenistic_art" title="wikilink">Hellenistic style</a> <a href="relief" class="uri" title="wikilink">relief</a> sculptures and is framed by decorative <a href="Molding_(decorative)" title="wikilink">moldings</a>,<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> one of which divides the altar into two distinct <a href="Register_(sculpture)" title="wikilink">registers</a> of symmetrical composition.

<p>Northeast of the site, another 3rd century BCE temple stands adjacent to the Astarte chapel. Its  fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade is built with large limestone blocks and displays a two-register relief decoration illustrating a <a href="Bacchanalia" title="wikilink">drunken revelry</a> in honor of <a href="Dionysus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dionysus</a>, the Greek god of wine. Among the temple reliefs, one shows a man attempting to seize a large rooster which was the common sacrificial animal for Eshmun-Asclepius.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>The Eshmun Temple complex comprises an elaborate <a href="Hydraulics" title="wikilink">hydraulic installation</a> channeling water from &lt;U+201C&gt;Ydll&lt;U+201D&gt; spring that is made up of an intricate system of water canals, a series of retaining basins, sacred ablution basins and paved pools. This system demonstrates the importance of ritual ablutions in Phoenician therapeutic cults.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>Later vestiges date from the <a href="History_of_Lebanon_under_Roman_rule" title="wikilink">Roman epoch</a> and include a colonnaded road lined with shops. Of the large marble columns bordering the Roman street only fragments and bases remain. The <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Romans</a> also built a monumental staircase adorned with <a href="mosaic" class="uri" title="wikilink">mosaic</a> patterns that leads to the top of the podium. To the right of the Roman road, near the entrance of the site stands a <a href="nymphaeum" class="uri" title="wikilink">nymphaeum</a> with <a href="Niche_(architecture)" title="wikilink">niches</a> where statues of the <a href="nymph" title="wikilink">nymphs</a> once stood. The floor of the nymphaeum is covered by a mosaic depicting the <a href="Maenads" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maenads</a>. Across the colonaded road, facing the nymphaeum, are the ruins of a <a href="Roman_villa" title="wikilink">Roman villa</a>; only the villa&lt;U+2019&gt;s courtyard has survived along with the remains of a mosaic depicting the <a href="Season" title="wikilink">four seasons</a>. To the right of the processional Roman staircase stands a cubic <a href="altar" class="uri" title="wikilink">altar</a>, also of Roman construction. Other Roman period structures include two columns of a great portico leading to pools and other cultic installations.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a><a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="function">Function</h2>
<p>Eshmun&lt;U+2019&gt;s cult enjoyed a particular importance at Sidon as he was the chief deity after 500 BCE. Aside from the extramural sanctuary at Bustan el-Sheikh, Eshmun also had a temple within the city. The extramural Eshmun Temple was associated with purification and healing; ritual lustral ablutions were performed in the sanctuary&lt;U+2019&gt;s sacred basins supplemented by running water from the Asclepius River and the &lt;U+201D&gt;Ydll&lt;U+201D&gt; spring water which was considered to have a sacred character and therapeutic quality.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> The healing attributions of Eshmun were combined with his divine consort Astarte&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="fertility" title="wikilink">fertilizing</a> powers; the latter had an annex chapel with a sacred paved pool within the Eshmun sanctuary.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Pilgrims from all over the ancient world flocked to the Eshmun Temple leaving <a href="Votive_offering" title="wikilink">votive</a> traces of their devotion and proof of their cure.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> There is evidence that from the 3rd century BCE onwards there have been attempts to Hellenize the cult of Eshmun and to associate him with his Greek counterpart Asclepius, but the sanctuary retained its curative function.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="artifacts-and-finds">Artifacts and finds</h2>
<p><img src="Votive_statue_Eshmun.jpg" title="fig:Votive marble head of a child found at the Eshmun Temple site; National Museum of Beirut collection, beginning of the 4th century BCE." alt="Votive marble head of a child found at the Eshmun Temple site; National Museum of Beirut collection, beginning of the 4th century BCE." /> Apart from the large decorative elements, carved friezes and mosaics which were left <a href="in_situ" title="wikilink">in situ</a>, many artifacts were recovered and moved from the Eshmun Temple to the <a href="National_Museum_of_Beirut" title="wikilink">national museum</a>, the <a href="Louvre" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louvre</a> or are in possession of the Lebanese directorate general of antiquities. Some of these smaller finds include a collection of inscribed <a href="ostracon" title="wikilink">ostraca</a> unearthed by Dunand providing rare examples of cursive Phoenician writing in the Phoenician mainland.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> One of the recovered ostracon bears the <a href="Theophoric_name" title="wikilink">theophoric</a> Phoenician name &quot;grtnt&quot; which suggests that veneration of the lunar-goddess <a href="Tanit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tanit</a> occurred in Sidon.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>A number of fragmented votive life-size sculptures of little children lying on their side and holding a pet animal or a small object were also recovered at the temple site; among the best known of these is a sculpture of a royal child holding a dove with his right hand; the boy&lt;U+2019&gt;s head is shaved, his torso is bare and his lower body is wrapped in a large cloth. The socle of this sculpture is inscribed with a dedication from Baalshillem,<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a>&lt;ref name&quot;JCL&quot;&gt;</ref> the son of a Sidonian king to Eshmun, which illustrates the importance of the site to the Sidonian monarchy.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a><a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a><a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> These votive sculptures appear to have been purposely broken after dedication to Eshmun and then ceremoniously cast into the sacred canal, probably simulating the sacrifice of the sick child. All of these sculptures represent boys.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> A  limestone bust of a <a href="Kouros" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kouros</a> dating from the 6th century BCE was found at the site, but unlike the archaic Greek kouroi this figure is not bare.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<p>Among the notable finds is a golden plaque showing <a href="Rod_of_Asclepius" title="wikilink">a snake curling on a staff</a>, a Hellenic symbol of Eshmun.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> and a <a href="granite" class="uri" title="wikilink">granite</a> <a href="altar" class="uri" title="wikilink">altar</a> bearing the name of <a href="Ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">Egyptian</a> <a href="Pharaoh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pharaoh</a> <a href="Achoris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Achoris</a> uncovered in the Eshmun sanctuary.

<p>The repute of the sanctuary was far reaching. <a href="Cyprus" title="wikilink">Cypriot</a> pilgrims from <a href="Paphos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paphos</a> left marks of their devotion for Astarte on a marble <a href="stele" class="uri" title="wikilink">stele</a> inscribed both in Greek and <a href="Cypriot_syllabary" title="wikilink">Cypriot syllabary</a> at Astarte's shrine; this stele is now in the custody of the Lebanese directorate general of antiquities.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="pillaging">Pillaging</h2>
<p>Treasure hunters have sought out the Eshmun Temple since antiquity;<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> around 1900 artifacts bearing Phoenician inscriptions from the temple site found their way to <a href="Beirut" title="wikilink">Beirutine</a> <a href="Antiquities_trade" title="wikilink">antiquities markets</a> where they stirred the interest of the <a href="Ottoman_empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman</a> authorities and prompted a series of archeological digs.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> During the civil war, upon a request from then Lebanese director general of antiquities Maurice Chehab, Maurice Dunand moved more than 2000 artifacts from Sidon to a subterranean chamber at the <a href="Byblos_Castle" title="wikilink">Byblos crusader castle</a>,  north of Beirut. In 1981, the depot was looted and around 600 sculptures and architectural elements were stolen and smuggled out of Lebanon. Rolf Stucky, ex-director of the Institute of Classical Archeology of <a href="Basel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Basel</a> affirmed during a conference in Beirut in December 2009 the successful identification and return of eight sculptures to the Lebanese national museum.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
