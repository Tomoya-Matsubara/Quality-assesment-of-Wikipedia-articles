<p>Financial problems started to hit Souths in the early 1970s, forcing some players to go to other clubs. The licensed Leagues Club, traditionally such an important revenue provider to all first grade league sides, was closed in 1973 but a &quot;Save Our Souths&quot; campaign ensured the club survived. &quot;Super Coach&quot; <a href="Jack_Gibson_(rugby_league)" title="wikilink">Jack Gibson</a>'s<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> arrival turned the club's form, winning the pre-season competition in 1978.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The club captured victories in the mid-week <a href="Amco_Cup" title="wikilink">Tooth Cup</a> competition in <a href="New_South_Wales_Rugby_League_season_1981" title="wikilink">1981</a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and in the pre-season <a href="Rugby_League_World_Sevens" title="wikilink">&quot;Sevens&quot;</a> competition in 1988.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The Rabbitohs were able to make the finals on five occasions in the 1980s, including a dominant season to finish as minor premiers in <a href="New_South_Wales_Rugby_League_season_1989" title="wikilink">1989</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The <a href="New_South_Wales_Rugby_League_season_1989" title="wikilink">1989 season</a> proved to be the club's most successful in years, but also marked the last time the club has been able to reach the finals. The following season the Rabbitohs finished as <a href="wooden_spoon" title="wikilink">wooden spooners</a>.</p>
<p>The club stayed afloat in the 1990s despite major financial problems. Souths' only success came in <a href="New_South_Wales_Rugby_League_season_1994" title="wikilink">1994</a> when they won the pre-season competition, defeating the <a href="Brisbane_Broncos" title="wikilink">Brisbane Broncos</a> 27&lt;U+2013&gt;26 in the final.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The <a href="Super_League_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Super League War</a> and the eventual formation of the <a href="National_Rugby_League" title="wikilink">National Rugby League</a> affected the club greatly when it was determined in 1998 that the newly formed competition would be contracted to 14 teams for the 2000 season. Following a series of mergers by other teams South Sydney failed to meet the NRL's selection criteria to compete in the competition and were subsequently excluded from the premiership at the end of the <a href="National_Rugby_League_season_1999" title="wikilink">1999 season</a>.</p>
<p>In 2000 and 2001, South Sydney fought their way back into the competition following a string of high profile legal battles against the National Rugby League and <a href="News_Limited" title="wikilink">News Limited</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> A number of well attended public rallies took place during this time, as supporters from many different clubs got behind South Sydney's case. Upon appeal to the <a href="Federal_Court_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Federal Court</a> in 2001,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> South Sydney won readmission into the premiership for the <a href="National_Rugby_League_season_2002" title="wikilink">2002 season</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Since being readmitted, the Rabbitohs have been rather unsuccessful in the premiership, finishing amongst the bottom three teams for five seasons straight including three <a href="wooden_spoon" title="wikilink">wooden spoons</a>. However, following the club's takeover by famous Hollywood actor <a href="Russell_Crowe" title="wikilink">Russell Crowe</a> and <a href="Peter_Holmes_a_Court" title="wikilink">Peter Holmes a Court</a> in 2006,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> the club has had great success in securing a number of major player signings as well as recruiting several key managerial positions including <a href="Jason_Taylor_(rugby_league_footballer)" title="wikilink">Jason Taylor</a> as head coach.</p>
<h2 id="crest">Crest</h2>
<p><img src="Souths_emblem_orig.JPG" title="fig:The original Rabbitohs emblem introduced in 1959" alt="The original Rabbitohs emblem introduced in 1959" width="100" /> One version of how the club got the &quot;Rabbitohs&quot; nickname comes from their <a href="rugby_union" title="wikilink">rugby union</a> days at the turn of the 20th century. In those hard times, players wearing their <a href="cardinal_red" title="wikilink">cardinal red</a> and <a href="myrtle_(color)" title="wikilink">myrtle green</a> football jumpers, earned some extra money on Saturday mornings by hawking rabbits around the district with the traditional cry of &quot;Rabbitoh!&quot; echoing through the narrow streets.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> As they made a sale, they would sling the bunny from their shoulder and skin it on the spot, inevitably accumulating some of the fur and blood on their jerseys as they did so. When they played in those blood stained jumpers that afternoon, opponents from wealthier rugby clubs did not always appreciate the aroma and would mockingly repeat the &quot;Rabbitoh!&quot; cry.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Another account of the legend relates that the Rabbitoh name was a disparaging reference by opposing teams to South's home ground being plagued with &quot;rabbit 'oles&quot;. In those early days <a href="Redfern_Oval" title="wikilink">Redfern Oval</a> was then known as Nathan's Cow Paddock.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Yet another version links the Rabbitoh name as being adopted from that of the touring <a href="Australia_national_rugby_union_team" title="wikilink">Australian rugby union</a> teams of the early 1900s who where nicknamed &quot;Rabbits&quot; prior to discarding the name in 1908 in favour of the moniker &quot;Wallabies&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>The &quot;Rabbitoh&quot; emblem (a white running rabbit) first appeared on the team's jersey in <a href="New_South_Wales_Rugby_League_season_1959" title="wikilink">1959</a>. The Rabbitoh emblem has in various forms been carried as the club's crest on all players jerseys ever since. The original &quot;Rabbitoh&quot; emblem design that appeared on the team's jerseys throughout the 1960s and 1970's has now been incorporated on the current jersey.</p>
<h2 id="colours">Colours</h2>
<p><img src="Minties_jersey.jpg" title="fig:South Sydney &quot;Minties&quot; jersey of the early 1980s." alt="South Sydney &quot;Minties&quot; jersey of the early 1980s." width="150" /> South Sydney has used <a href="cardinal_red" title="wikilink">cardinal red</a> and <a href="myrtle_(color)" title="wikilink">myrtle green</a> colours on its playing jerseys for the vast majority of the club's history. Some sources have suggested that this combination of colours was due to the local <a href="rugby_union" title="wikilink">rugby union</a> club being nicknamed the &quot;Redfern Waratahs&quot;. The first British inhabitants had often called the <a href="waratah" class="uri" title="wikilink">waratah</a> a &quot;red fern&quot; instead, hence giving the suburb its name, and ultimately the local rugby club its emblem. Red and green dominate the colours of the waratah and hence, possibly, the South Sydney Rugby League Football Club adopted these colours for their jerseys.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>The club's jersey has been a hooped-styled one comprising of alternating red and green, and has been used for the vast majority of the club's history.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> In 1945 and 1946 the club broke with this tradition and used a green design with a red &quot;V&quot; around the collar, before reverting back to the original hoop style. From <a href="New_South_Wales_Rugby_League_season_1980" title="wikilink">1980</a> to 1984 the team played in a strip which saw the inclusion of white hoops within a predominately green design with a central red stripe and was affectionately known as the &quot;Minties&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> jersey (so-called due to its apparent similarity to the wrapper design of the popular candy).<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> With the introduction of &quot;away&quot; jerseys towards the end of the <a href="20th_Century" title="wikilink">20th Century</a>, the club initially introduced a predominantly white jersey for away matches which was changed to a predominantly black one for the <a href="National_Rugby_League_season_2006" title="wikilink">2006 season</a>.</p>
<p>Before the start of the <a href="National_Rugby_League_season_2007" title="wikilink">2007 season</a>, the club announced that the away jersey would be styled identically to the traditional home jersey, with the exception of sponsorship and the rabbit emblem, which as been styled similarly to the one that initially featured on jerseys in the 1960s.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> For home matches, the rabbit emblem will remain white and for away matches the emblem will be black.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>The playing shorts worn were historically black, though in the late 1970s the club adopted green shorts with a red vertical stripe. This was then superceded by the white shorts of the &quot;Minties&quot; outfit. When the club subsequently reverted to their traditional playing strip, the decision was made to wear black shorts once more.</p>

<p><img src="Aussie_Stadium.jpg" title="fig:The Sydney Football Stadium as it appears whilst hosting a National Rugby League finals match." alt="The Sydney Football Stadium as it appears whilst hosting a National Rugby League finals match." width="250" /> During the early years of the <a href="New_South_Wales_Rugby_League_premiership" title="wikilink">New South Wales Rugby League premiership</a>, &quot;home games&quot; were not assigned as readily as they are today. However, South Sydney played most of their games at the <a href="Sydney_Showground" title="wikilink">Royal Agricultural Society Ground</a> from 1908 until the club's final departure in 1920. From 1911 onwards, the <a href="Sydney_Sports_Ground" title="wikilink">Sydney Sports Ground</a> was also used interchangeably with the Agricultural Ground over a decade for hosting matches.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In 1947 the club played its final season at the Sports Ground, before relocating to <a href="Redfern_Oval" title="wikilink">Redfern Oval</a> in 1948.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> It was here that team played in the heart of the club's territory and played the vast majority of its allocated home matches for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>In 1988, the club began to play in the newly-built <a href="Sydney_Football_Stadium" title="wikilink">Sydney Football Stadium</a>,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> built upon the former Sydney Sports Ground and Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2 Oval. <img src="Panorama-TelstraStadium-Oct2005.jpg" title="fig:Telstra Stadium the Rabbitohs current home ground." alt="Telstra Stadium the Rabbitohs current home ground." width="250" />The side continued to play here up until 2005, with the exception of 2000 and 2001 during South Sydney's absence from the premiership. In 2006 the club relocated games to <a href="Telstra_Stadium" title="wikilink">Telstra Stadium</a> in <a href="Sydney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sydney</a>'s west, where it continues to be stationed for home matches until the club's contract with Telstra Stadium ends at the end of 2008.</p>
<p>Currently $19.5 million is being spent by the <a href="City_of_Sydney" title="wikilink">City of Sydney Council</a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> to completely upgrade and renovate Redfern Oval which will allow the Rabbitohs to return to Redfern in 2008 for training as well as the option of hosting minor pre-season and exhibition matches.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Bob_McCarthy" title="wikilink">Bob McCarthy</a> holds the record for the most first grade games for the club, having played 211 matches between 1963 and 1978.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Craig Coleman and <a href="Eric_Simms" title="wikilink">Eric Simms</a> are the only other two players to have played over 200 matches, having taken to the field in 208 and 206 games respectively.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Eric_Simms" title="wikilink">Eric Simms</a> holds the club record for the most points, tallying 1841 points between 1965 and 1975.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> <a href="John_Graves" title="wikilink">Johnny Graves</a>' tally of 29 points in a match against <a href="Sydney_Roosters" title="wikilink">Eastern Suburbs</a> in 1952<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> remains the club record for the most individual points in a match. Had this feat been scored as it is today it would have stood at 32 points. Eric Simms scored 265 points on his own for South Sydney in 1969 and this tally along with ones achieved in 1970 and 1967 remain unsurpassed by any other player at the club.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The 1969 tally was once a league record, and has since been broken by a number of players at other clubs.</p>
<p>Eric Simms still holds a club and competition record for the most number of goals (112 goals and 19 field goals) in a season, most career field goals (86) and most field goals in a game (5).</p>
<p>Between 1921 and 1933 <a href="Benny_Wearing" title="wikilink">Benny Wearing</a> scored 144 tries in his 172 games for the club,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> which is an exceptional proportion of tries per games played. <a href="Les_Brennan" title="wikilink">Les Brennan</a>'s 29 tries in 19 games in 1954 remain a club record,<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> having broken <a href="John_Graves" title="wikilink">Johnny Graves</a>' tally of 28 in 17 games set just three years earlier. During his career Bob McCarthy scored 100 tries for the club, the most by a forward.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>The Rabbitohs have won the most first grade premierships, <a href="South_Sydney_Rabbitohs_competition_honours" title="wikilink">20</a> in all.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> They have also won the most reserve grade premierships, again 20.</p>
<p><a href="Jack_Rayner" title="wikilink">Jack Rayner</a> holds the individual record of the most grand final successes as a captain (5) and coach (5) achieved between 1950 and 1955.</p>
<p>The club has the distinction of scoring the most points (42), most tries (8) and most goals (9) in a grand final, all achieved against <a href="Manly_Sea_Eagles" title="wikilink">Manly</a> in 1951.</p>
<p>Souths' 1925 first grade side is one of six NSW sides to ever go through a season undefeated. The club won the premiership in all three grades in 1925, a feat only repeated on three other occasions (<a href="Balmain_Tigers" title="wikilink">Balmain Tigers</a> in 1915 and 1916 and <a href="St_George_Dragons" title="wikilink">St George Dragons</a> in 1963).</p>

<p>While other players may play for South Sydney during the year, the Rabbitohs as with every NRL club are required to select a top 25 First Grade squad for the season.
