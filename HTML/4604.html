<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The Durant area was once claimed by both Spain and France before officially becoming part of the United State after the <a href="Louisiana_Purchase" title="wikilink">Louisiana Purchase</a> and <a href="Adams-Onis_Treaty" title="wikilink">Adams-Onis Treaty</a>. During the 1820s and 1830s the area was designated as part of the Choctaw Nation in the southern Indian Territory. During the <a href="Indian_removal" title="wikilink">Indian removals</a> the Choctaws followed the <a href="Choctaw_Trail_of_Tears" title="wikilink">Choctaw Trail of Tears</a> from their ancestral homeland in <a href="Mississippi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mississippi</a> and <a href="Alabama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alabama</a> into this area. The Choctaw Nation originally extended from the <a href="Mexico" title="wikilink">Mexican</a> border in the west (now part of the <a href="Texas_panhandle" title="wikilink">Texas panhandle</a>) to the <a href="Arkansas_Territory" title="wikilink">Arkansas Territory</a> in the east, from the Red River in the south to the <a href="South_Canadian_River" title="wikilink">South Canadian River</a> in the north.</p>
<p>Pierre Durant and his four sons, all of French-Choctaw origin, made the journey up the Trail of Tears on the way to the southeastern part of the <a href="Choctaw_Nation_of_Oklahoma" title="wikilink">Choctaw Nation</a> in 1832. The brothers, grown, with families of their own, established homesteads from the Arkansas line to Durant. One son, Fisher, married to a full blood <a href="Choctaw" class="uri" title="wikilink">Choctaw</a>, found a beautiful location for a home between Durant's present Eight and Ninth Avenues.</p>
<p>Fisher Durant's son Dixon Durant is recognized as the founder of Durant and is honored as its namesake. As an early day minister, businessman and civic leader, Dixon Durant is credited with pastorates in local Presbyterian, Congregationalist and Methodist churches. He established the first store selling general merchandise and possibly influenced the 1872 creation of the <a href="Missouri-Kansas-Texas_Railroad" title="wikilink">Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad</a> (Katy Railroad) siding at Durant, thus producing the initial impetus for establishing the community.</p>
<p>A <a href="post_office" title="wikilink">post office</a> for &lt;U+201C&gt;Durant Station&lt;U+201D&gt; was authorized in 1879, evidence that a village of some size had developed during the seven years since the coming of the railroad. A.E. Fulsom was post master. Discontinued in 1881, the post office re-established in 1882 with the address as &lt;U+201C&gt;Durant, Choctaw Nation, Indian Territory.&lt;U+201D&gt; The word &lt;U+201C&gt;station&lt;U+201D&gt; was never again used as part of the official name for the community.</p>
<p>W.H. Hilton was elected as the first mayor of Durant.</p>
<p>A memorable event in Durant&lt;U+2019&gt;s rail history occurred on April 5, 1905. A special southbound Katy train stopped in the city with none other than President <a href="Theodore_Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Theodore Roosevelt</a> aboard.</p>
<p>Bryan County was created from Choctaw lands in 1907, the same time as statehood, and was named after <a href="William_Jennings_Bryan" title="wikilink">William Jennings Bryan</a>. He was nominated three times for <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President of the United States</a> and at the age of 36 lost to <a href="William_McKinley" title="wikilink">William McKinley</a>. He also lost to <a href="Woodrow_Wilson" title="wikilink">Woodrow Wilson</a>, and <a href="William_H._Taft" title="wikilink">William H. Taft</a>. Woodrow Wilson appointed Bryan as <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_State" title="wikilink">United States Secretary of State</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="1894" class="uri" title="wikilink">1894</a>, <a href="Calvin_Institute" title="wikilink">Calvin Institute</a>, one of a few schools for <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native American</a> youths, was established in Durant. The school was to change its name twice more (Durant Presbyterian College in <a href="1900" class="uri" title="wikilink">1900</a>, and Oklahoma Presbyterian College in <a href="1910" class="uri" title="wikilink">1910</a>), and by <a href="1899" class="uri" title="wikilink">1899</a> it had attracted an enrollment of 300. The school eventually became known as Oklahoma Presbyterian College. This was accomplished shortly after Oklahoma was admitted to the Union as a State. The support for the school came from the <a href="Choctaw_Nation_of_Oklahoma" title="wikilink">Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma</a>, the federal government, and several denominational missionary boards. Because of financial difficulties, the school was closed as a learning institution in the late 1960s.</p>

Impressive ceremonies were held August 17, 1976, commemorating the title transfer.

The buildings has been renovated, and administration of many Choctaw programs are headquartered there.</p>
<p>Calvin Institute was originally the North Building of the Choctaw Nation Headquarters.

The Nation and has since then built several other structures behind the main buildings to accommodate even more growth, creating today's complex.</p>
