He also serves as a member of the board of trustees at <a href="Grinnell_College" title="wikilink">Grinnell College</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Buffett was born in 1930 in <a href="Omaha,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Omaha, Nebraska</a>, the second of three children and only son of businessman and politician <a href="Howard_Buffett" title="wikilink">Howard Buffett</a>,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and his wife Leila (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Stahl). Buffett began his education at Rose Hill Elementary School in Omaha. In 1942, his father was elected to the first of four terms in the <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">United States Congress</a>, and after moving with his family to Washington, D.C., Warren finished elementary school, attended Alice Deal Junior High School, and graduated from <a href="Woodrow_Wilson_High_School_(Washington,_DC)" title="wikilink">Woodrow Wilson High School</a> in 1947, where his senior yearbook picture reads: &quot;likes math; a future stock broker.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Even as a child, Buffett displayed an interest in making and saving money. He went door to door selling chewing gum, <a href="Coca-Cola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Coca-Cola</a>, or weekly magazines. For a while, he worked in his grandfather's grocery store. While still in high school he was successful in making money by delivering newspapers, selling golfballs and stamps, and detailing cars, among other means. Filing his first income <a href="Tax_return_(United_States)" title="wikilink">tax return</a> in 1944, Buffett took a $35 deduction for the use of his bicycle and watch on his paper route.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In 1945, in his sophomore year of high school, Buffett and a friend spent $25 to purchase a used <a href="pinball" class="uri" title="wikilink">pinball</a> machine, which they placed in the local <a href="barber" title="wikilink">barber shop</a>. Within months, they owned several machines in different barber shops.</p>
<p>Buffett's interest in the stock market and investing also dated to his childhood, to the days he spent in the customers' lounge of a regional <a href="stock_brokerage" title="wikilink">stock brokerage</a> near the office of his father's own brokerage company. On a trip to New York City at the age of ten, he made a point to visit the <a href="New_York_Stock_Exchange" title="wikilink">New York Stock Exchange</a>. At the age of 11, he bought three shares of <a href="Cities_Service" title="wikilink">Cities Service</a> Preferred for himself, and three for his sister.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> While in high school he invested in a business owned by his father and bought a farm worked by a tenant farmer. By the time he finished college, Buffett had accumulated more than $90,000 in savings measured in 2009 dollars.</p>

<p>Buffett entered college as a freshmen in 1947 at the <a href="Wharton_Business_School" title="wikilink">Wharton Business School</a> of the <a href="University_of_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">University of Pennsylvania</a> and studied there for two years from 1947 to 1949. In the year 1950, when he entered his junior year, he transferred to the <a href="University_of_Nebraska&lt;U+2013&gt;Lincoln" title="wikilink">University of Nebraska&lt;U+2013&gt;Lincoln</a> where at the age of nineteen, he graduated with a degree of Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. After the completion of his undergraduate studies, Buffett enrolled at <a href="Columbia_Business_School" title="wikilink">Columbia Business School</a> after learning that <a href="Benjamin_Graham" title="wikilink">Benjamin Graham</a> (author of &quot;<a href="The_Intelligent_Investor" title="wikilink">The Intelligent Investor</a>&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; one of his favorite books on investing) and <a href="David_Dodd" title="wikilink">David Dodd</a>, two well-known <a href="securities_analyst" title="wikilink">securities analysts</a>, taught there. He received a M.S. in Economics from <a href="Columbia_Business_School" title="wikilink">Columbia Business School</a> in 1951. Buffett also attended the <a href="New_York_Institute_of_Finance" title="wikilink">New York Institute of Finance</a>. In Buffett&lt;U+2019&gt;s own words: </p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>

<p>Warren Buffett was employed from 1951&lt;U+2013&gt;54 at <em>Buffett-Falk &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="Omaha,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Omaha</a> as an investment salesman, from 1954&lt;U+2013&gt;1956 at <em>Graham-Newman Corp.</em>, New York as a securities analyst, from 1956&lt;U+2013&gt;1969 at <em>Buffett Partnership, Ltd.</em>, Omaha as a general partner and from 1970Â &lt;U+2013&gt; Present at <a href="Berkshire_Hathaway" title="wikilink">Berkshire Hathaway Inc</a>, Omaha as its <a href="Chair_(official)" title="wikilink">Chairman</a>, CEO.</p>
<p>In 1950, at the age of 20, Buffett had made and saved $9,800. In April 1952, Buffett discovered <a href="Benjamin_Graham" title="wikilink">Graham</a> was on the board of <a href="GEICO" class="uri" title="wikilink">GEICO</a> insurance. Taking a train to Washington, D.C. on a Saturday, he knocked on the door of GEICO's headquarters until a janitor allowed him in. There he met Lorimer Davidson, Geico's Vice President, and the two discussed the insurance business for hours. Davidson would eventually become Buffett's life-long friend and a lasting influence<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and later recall that he found Buffett to be an &quot;extraordinary man&quot; after only fifteen minutes. Buffett graduated from Columbia and wanted to work on <a href="Wall_Street" title="wikilink">Wall Street</a>, however, both his father and Ben Graham urged him not to. He offered to work for Graham for free, but Graham refused.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Buffett returned to Omaha and worked as a stockbroker while taking a <a href="Dale_Carnegie" title="wikilink">Dale Carnegie</a> public speaking course. Using what he learned, he felt confident enough to teach an &quot;Investment Principles&quot; night class at the <a href="University_of_Nebraska-Omaha" title="wikilink">University of Nebraska-Omaha</a>. The average age of his students was more than twice his own. During this time he also purchased a Sinclair Texaco gas station as a side investment. However, this did not turn out to be a successful business venture.</p>
<p>In 1952<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Buffett married <a href="Susan_Buffett" title="wikilink">Susan Thompson</a> at Dundee Presbyterian Church and the next year they had their first child, <a href="Susan_Alice_Buffett" title="wikilink">Susan Alice Buffett</a>. In 1954, Buffett accepted a job at <a href="Benjamin_Graham" title="wikilink">Benjamin Graham</a>'s partnership. His starting salary was $12,000 a year (approximately $97,000 adjusted to 2008 dollars). There he worked closely with <a href="Walter_Schloss" title="wikilink">Walter Schloss</a>. Graham was a tough man to work for. He was adamant that stocks provide a wide margin of safety after weighting the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. The argument made sense to Buffett but he questioned whether the criteria were too stringent and caused the company to miss out on big winners that had more qualitative values. That same year the Buffetts had their second child, <a href="Howard_Graham_Buffett" title="wikilink">Howard Graham Buffett</a>. In 1956, <a href="Benjamin_Graham" title="wikilink">Benjamin Graham</a> retired and closed his partnership. At this time Buffett's personal savings were over $174,000 ($1.2Â million inflation adjusted to 2009 dollars) and he started Buffett Partnership Ltd., an investment partnership in Omaha.</p>
<p><img src="Dundee_HD_Omaha_NE.JPG" title="fig:Buffett&#39;s home in Omaha" alt="Buffett&#39;s home in Omaha" /> In 1957, Buffett had three partnerships operating the entire year. He purchased a five-bedroom stucco house in <a href="Omaha,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Omaha</a>, where he still lives, for $31,500. In 1958 the Buffett's third child, <a href="Peter_Andrew_Buffett" title="wikilink">Peter Andrew Buffett</a>, was born. Buffett operated five partnerships the entire year. In 1959, the company grew to six partnerships operating the entire year and Buffett was introduced to <a href="Charlie_Munger" title="wikilink">Charlie Munger</a>. By 1960, Buffett had seven partnerships operating: Buffett Associates, Buffett Fund, Dacee, Emdee, Glenoff, Mo-Buff and Underwood. He asked one of his partners, a doctor, to find ten other doctors willing to invest $10,000 each in his partnership. Eventually eleven agreed, and Buffett pooled their money with a mere $100 original investment of his own. In 1961, Buffett revealed that Sanborn Map Company accounted for 35% of the partnership's assets. He explained that in 1958 Sanborn stock sold at only $45 per share when the value of the Sanborn investment portfolio was $65 per share. This meant that buyers valued Sanborn stock at &quot;minus $20&quot; per share and were unwilling to pay more than 70 cents on the dollar for an investment portfolio with a map business thrown in for nothing. This earned him a spot on the board of Sanborn.</p>
<h3 id="as-a-millionaire">As a millionaire</h3>
<p>In 1962, Buffett became a millionaire, because of his partnerships, which in January 1962 had an excess of $7,178,500, of which over $1,025,000 belonged to Buffett. Buffett merged all partnerships into one partnership. Buffett invested in and eventually took control of a textile manufacturing firm, Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett's partnerships began purchasing shares at $7.60 per share. In 1965, when Buffett's partnerships began purchasing Berkshire aggressively, they paid $14.86 per share while the company had <a href="working_capital" title="wikilink">working capital</a> of $19 per share. This did not include the value of fixed assets (factory and equipment). Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway at the board meeting and named a new president, Ken Chace, to run the company. In 1966, Buffett closed the partnership to new money. Buffett wrote in his letter: &quot;... unless it appears that circumstances have changed (under some conditions added capital would improve results) or unless new partners can bring some asset to the partnership other than simply capital, I intend to admit no additional partners to BPL.&quot;</p>
<p>In a second letter, Buffett announced his first investment in a private businessÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; Hochschild, Kohn and Co, a privately owned Baltimore department store. In 1967, Berkshire paid out its first and only dividend of 10 cents. In 1969, following his most successful year, Buffett liquidated the partnership and transferred their assets to his partners. Among the assets paid out were shares of Berkshire Hathaway. In 1970, as chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett began writing his now-famous annual letters to shareholders. However, he lived solely on his salary of $50,000 per year, and his outside investment income. In 1979, Berkshire began the year trading at $775 per share, and ended at $1,310. Buffett's net worth reached $620Â million, placing him on the <a href="Forbes_400" title="wikilink">Forbes 400</a> for the first time.</p>
<p>In 1973, Berkshire began to acquire stock in the <a href="Washington_Post_Company" title="wikilink">Washington Post Company</a>. Buffett became close friends with <a href="Katharine_Graham" title="wikilink">Katharine Graham</a>, who controlled the company and its flagship newspaper, and became a member of its board of directors. In 1974, the SEC opened a formal investigation into Warren Buffett and Berkshire's acquisition of WESCO, due to possible conflict of interest. No charges were brought. In 1977, Berkshire indirectly purchased the <em>Buffalo Evening News</em> for $32.5Â million. Antitrust charges started, instigated by its rival, the <em>Buffalo Courier-Express</em>. Both papers lost money, until the <em>Courier-Express</em> folded in 1982.</p>
<p>In 1979, Berkshire began to acquire stock in ABC. Capital Cities announced $3.5Â billion purchase of ABC on March 18, 1985 surprised the media industry, as ABC was four times bigger than Capital Cities at the time. <a href="Berkshire_Hathaway" title="wikilink">Berkshire Hathaway</a> chairman Warren Buffett helped finance the deal in return for a 25% stake in the combined company.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The newly merged company, known as Capital Cities/ABC (or CapCities/ABC), was forced to sell off some stations due to FCC ownership rules. Also, the two companies owned several radio stations in the same markets.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1987, Berkshire Hathaway purchased a 12% stake in Salomon Inc., making it the largest shareholder and Buffett the director. In 1990, a scandal involving <a href="John_Gutfreund" title="wikilink">John Gutfreund</a> (former CEO of <a href="Salomon_Brothers" title="wikilink">Salomon Brothers</a>) surfaced. A <a href="rogue_trader" title="wikilink">rogue trader</a>, <a href="Paul_Mozer" title="wikilink">Paul Mozer</a>, was submitting bids in excess of what was allowed by the Treasury rules. When this was discovered and brought to the attention of Gutfreund, he did not immediately suspend the rogue trader. Gutfreund left the company in August 1991.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Buffett became Chairman of Salomon until the crisis passed; on September 4, 1991, he testified before Congress.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In 1988, Buffett began buying stock in <a href="Coca-Cola_Company" title="wikilink">Coca-Cola Company</a>, eventually purchasing up to 7% of the company for $1.02Â billion. It would turn out to be one of Berkshire's most lucrative investments, and one which it still holds.</p>
<h3 id="as-a-billionaire">As a billionaire</h3>
<p>Buffett became a billionaire on paper when Berkshire Hathaway began selling class A shares on May 29, 1990, when the market closed at $7,175 a share.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In 1998, in an unusual move, he acquired <a href="General_Re" title="wikilink">General Re</a> (Gen Re) for stock. In 2002, Buffett became involved with <a href="Maurice_R._Greenberg" title="wikilink">Maurice R. Greenberg</a> at <a href="AIG" class="uri" title="wikilink">AIG</a>, with General Re providing <a href="reinsurance" class="uri" title="wikilink">reinsurance</a>. On March 15, 2005, AIG's board forced Greenberg to resign from his post as Chairman and CEO under the shadow of criticism from <a href="Eliot_Spitzer" title="wikilink">Eliot Spitzer</a>, former attorney general of the state of New York. On February 9, 2006, AIG and the New York State Attorney General's office agreed to a settlement in which AIG would pay a fine of $1.6Â billion.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In 2010, the federal government settled with Berkshire Hathaway for $92Â million in return for the firm avoiding prosecution in an AIG fraud scheme, and undergoing 'corporate governance concessions'.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2002, Buffett entered in $11Â billion worth of <a href="forward_contract" title="wikilink">forward contracts</a> to deliver U.S. dollars against other currencies. By April 2006, his total gain on these contracts was over $2Â billion. In 2006, Buffett announced in June that he gradually would give away 85% of his Berkshire holdings to five foundations in annual gifts of stock, starting in July 2006. The largest contribution would go to the <a href="Bill_and_Melinda_Gates_Foundation" title="wikilink">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In 2007, in a letter to shareholders, Buffett announced that he was looking for a younger successor, or perhaps successors, to run his investment business.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Buffett had previously selected Lou Simpson, who runs investments at <a href="Geico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Geico</a>, to fill that role. However, Simpson is only six years younger than Buffett.</p>

<p>Buffett ran into criticism<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> during the <a href="Subprime_mortgage_crisis" title="wikilink">subprime crisis of 2007&lt;U+2013&gt;2008</a>, part of the <a href="late_2000s_recession" title="wikilink">late 2000s recession</a>, that he had allocated capital too early resulting in suboptimal deals. &lt;U+201C&gt;Buy American.

He thus became the single largest shareholder in the enlarged group with his <a href="Berkshire_Hathaway" title="wikilink">Berkshire Hathaway</a>, which provided $3Â billion, underlining his instrumental role during the current crisis in debt and equity markets.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>In addition to suggestions of mistiming, questions have been raised as to the wisdom in keeping some of Berkshire's major holdings, including The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) which in 1998 peaked at $86. Buffett discussed the difficulties of knowing when to sell in the company's 2004 annual report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That may seem easy to do when one looks through an always-clean, rear-view mirror. Unfortunately, however, it&lt;U+2019&gt;s the windshield through which investors must peer, and that glass is invariably fogged.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>In March 2009, Buffett stated in a cable television interview that the economy had &quot;fallen off a cliff... Not only has the economy slowed down a lot, but people have really changed their habits like I haven't seen&quot;. Additionally, Buffett fears we may revisit a 1970s level of inflation, which led to a painful <a href="stagflation" class="uri" title="wikilink">stagflation</a> that lasted many years.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2009, Buffett divested his failed investment in ConocoPhillips, saying to his Berkshire investors,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I bought a large amount of ConocoPhillips stock when oil and gas prices were near their peak. I in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices that occurred in the last half of the year. I still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current $40&lt;U+2013&gt;$50 price. But so far I have been dead wrong.

<p>The merger with the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (<a href="BNSF" class="uri" title="wikilink">BNSF</a>) closed upon BNSF shareholder approval in 1Q2010. This deal is valued at approximately $34Â billion and reflects an increase of a previously existing stake of about 22%.</p>
<p>In June 2010, Buffett defended the credit rating agencies for their role in the US financial crisis, claiming that:</p>

<p>Warren Buffett's writings include his annual reports and various articles. Buffett is recognized by communicators<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> as a great story-teller, as evidenced by his annual letters to shareholders. He warned about the pernicious effects of inflation:<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> </p>
<p>In his article <em><a href="The_Superinvestors_of_Graham-and-Doddsville" title="wikilink">The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville</a></em>, Buffett rebutted the academic <a href="Efficient-market_hypothesis" title="wikilink">Efficient-market hypothesis</a>, that beating the <a href="S&amp;P_500" title="wikilink">S&amp;P 500</a> was &quot;pure chance&quot;, by highlighting the results achieved by a number of students of the Graham and Dodd value investing school of thought.

<h3 id="philanthropy">Philanthropy</h3>
<p>The following quotation from 1988 highlights Warren Buffett's thoughts on his wealth and why he long planned to re-allocate it:</p>

<p>From a <em>NY Times</em> article: &quot;I don't believe in dynastic wealth&quot;, Warren Buffett said, calling those who grow up in wealthy circumstances &quot;members of the lucky sperm club&quot;.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Buffett has written several times of his belief that, in a market economy, the rich earn outsized rewards for their talents: </p>
<p>His children will not inherit a significant proportion of his wealth. This is consistent with statements he has made in the past indicating his opposition to the transfer of great fortunes from one generation to the next.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Buffett once commented, &quot;I want to give my kids just enough so that they would feel that they could do anything, but not so much that they would feel like doing nothing&quot;.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>In June 2006, he announced a plan to give away his fortune to charity, with 83% of it going to the <a href="Bill_&amp;_Melinda_Gates_Foundation" title="wikilink">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> He pledged about the equivalent of 10 million <a href="Berkshire_Hathaway" title="wikilink">Berkshire Hathaway</a> Class B shares to the <a href="Bill_&amp;_Melinda_Gates_Foundation" title="wikilink">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> (worth approximately US$30.7Â billion as of June 23, 2006),<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> making it the largest charitable donation in history, and Buffett one of the leaders of <a href="philanthrocapitalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">philanthrocapitalism</a>.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> The foundation will receive 5% of the total donation on an annualised basis each July, beginning in 2006. (Significantly, however, the pledge is conditional upon the foundation's giving away each year, beginning in 2009, an amount that is at least equal to the value of the entire previous year's gift from Buffett, in addition to 5% of the foundation's net assets.) Buffett also will join the board of directors of the Gates Foundation, although he does not plan to be actively involved in the foundation's investments.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a><a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>

<p>In a letter to Fortune Magazine's website in 2010 Buffett remarked: </p>
<p>This statement was made as part of a joint proposal with Bill Gates to encourage other wealthy individuals to pool some of their fortunes for charitable purposes.</p>
<p>Bill Gates's wife Melinda urged people to learn a lesson from the philanthropic efforts of the family that sold its home and gave away half of its value, as detailed in <em><a href="The_Power_of_Half" title="wikilink">The Power of Half</a></em>.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a><a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> On December 9, 2010, Buffett, Bill Gates, and <a href="Mark_Zuckerberg" title="wikilink">Mark Zuckerberg</a> (Facebook's CEO), signed a promise they called the &quot;Gates-Buffett <a href="Giving_Pledge" title="wikilink">Giving Pledge</a>&quot;, in which they promised to donate to charity at least half of their wealth over time, and invited others among the wealthy to donate 50% or more of their wealth to charity.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a><a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>

The cancellations came in the wake of pressure from regulators and citizen groups, including a petition drive organized by Salt Lake City commercial real estate broker Alexander Lofft and directed at Buffett personally. The 1,600 petitioners, who described themselves in a letter to Buffett as &quot;a collection of citizens, business owners and managers, service professionals, public servants, and organization representatives ... your friends and new customers here in Utah,&quot; explained that, in their view, any further expansion of coal generation in Utah would &quot;compromise our health, obscure our viewsheds, shrink and contaminate our watersheds, and thin out our most beloved snow pack,&quot; concluding that &quot;our attractiveness as a place to live and work is also threatened, and so is our economic competitiveness as a major metro area and a state, compromising our recent gains in income and property values&quot;.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>

<p>American Indian tribes and salmon fishermen sought to win support from Warren Buffett for a proposal to remove four hydroelectric dams from the <a href="Klamath_River" title="wikilink">Klamath River</a>.

<h3 id="trade-deficit">Trade deficit</h3>
<p>Buffett views the United States' expanding <a href="trade_deficit" title="wikilink">trade deficit</a> as a trend that will devalue the US dollar and US assets. He believes that the US dollar will lose value in the long run, as a result of putting a larger portion of ownership of US assets in the hands of foreigners. In his letter to shareholders in March 2005, Warren Buffett predicted that in another ten years&lt;U+2019&gt; time the net ownership of the U.S. by outsiders would amount to $11 <a href="Trillion_(short_scale)" title="wikilink">trillion</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Americans ... would chafe at the idea of perpetually paying tribute to their creditors and owners abroad. A country that is now aspiring to an &lt;U+2018&gt;<a href="ownership_society" title="wikilink">ownership society</a>&lt;U+2019&gt; will not find happiness in &lt;U+2013&gt; and I&lt;U+2019&gt;ll use hyperbole here for emphasis &lt;U+2013&gt; a '<a href="sharecropping" title="wikilink">sharecropping society</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;.</p>

<p>Author <a href="Ann_Pettifor" title="wikilink">Ann Pettifor</a> has adopted the image in her writings and has stated: &quot;He is right. And so the thing we must fear most now, is not just the collapse of banks and investment funds, or of the international financial architecture, but of a 'sharecropper society, angry at its downfall&quot;.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="dollar-and-gold">Dollar and gold</h3>
<p>The trade deficit induced Buffett to enter the foreign currency market for the first time in 2002. However, he substantially reduced his stake in 2005 as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts. Buffett continues to be <a href="Bear_market" title="wikilink">bearish</a> on the dollar, and says he is looking to acquire companies which derive a substantial portion of their revenues from outside the United States. Buffett emphasized the non-productive aspect of a <a href="gold_standard" title="wikilink">gold standard</a> for the USD in 1998 at Harvard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1977 Buffett was also quoted as saying about stocks, gold, farmland, and inflation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation &lt;U+2013&gt; at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>

<p>Buffett favors the <a href="inheritance_tax" title="wikilink">inheritance tax</a>, saying that repealing it would be like &quot;choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold-medal winners in the <a href="2000_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">2000 Olympics</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> In 2007, Buffett testified before the Senate and urged them to preserve the estate tax so as to avoid a <a href="plutocracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">plutocracy</a>.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> Some critics have argued that Buffett (through Berkshire Hathaway) has a personal interest in the continuation of the estate tax, since Berkshire Hathaway has benefited from the estate tax in past business dealings and had developed and marketed insurance policies to protect policy holders against future estate tax payments.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> Buffett believes government should not be in the business of gambling, or legalizing casinos, calling it a tax on ignorance.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="expensing-of-stock-options">Expensing of stock options</h3>
<p>He has been a strong proponent of <a href="stock_option_expensing" title="wikilink">stock option expensing</a> on the Income Statement. At the 2004 annual meeting, he lambasted a bill before the United States Congress that would consider only some company-issued stock options compensation as an expense, likening the bill to one that was almost passed by the <a href="Indiana_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Indiana House of Representatives</a> to <a href="Indiana_Pi_Bill" title="wikilink">change the value of Pi</a> from 3.14159 to 3.2 through legislative fiat.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a company gives something of value to its employees in return for their services, it is clearly a compensation expense. And if expenses don't belong in the earnings statement, where in the world do they belong?<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="investing-in-china">Investing in China</h3>
<p>Buffett invested in <a href="PetroChina" class="uri" title="wikilink">PetroChina</a> Company Limited and in a rare move, posted a commentary<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> on Berkshire Hathaway's website stating why he would not divest from the company despite calls from some activists to do so, due to its connection with the Sudanese civil war that caused Harvard to divest from the company in 2005. He did, however, sell this stake soon afterwards, sparing him the billions of dollars he would have lost had he held on to the company in the midst of the steep drop in oil prices beginning in the summer of 2008.</p>
<p>In October 2008, Buffett invested in new energy automobile business by paying $230Â million for 10% of <a href="BYD_Company" title="wikilink">BYD Company</a> (), which runs a subsidiary of electric automobile manufacturer <a href="BYD_Auto" title="wikilink">BYD Auto</a>. In less than one year, the investment has reaped him over 500% return of profit.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a></p>
