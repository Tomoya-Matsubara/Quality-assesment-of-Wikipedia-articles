<p>In October 2009, Shakira released her eighth studio album, <em><a href="She_Wolf" title="wikilink">She Wolf</a></em>. The composition of the record shifted from her more traditional <a href="Latin_pop" title="wikilink">Latin pop</a> and <a href="pop_rock" title="wikilink">pop rock</a> styles, and was primarily an <a href="electropop" class="uri" title="wikilink">electropop</a> album with combined elements of <a href="World_music" title="wikilink">world</a> and <a href="dancehall" class="uri" title="wikilink">dancehall</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The album was positively received by most <a href="music_critics" title="wikilink">music critics</a> and was praised for its distinguished nature and Shakira's experimentation with electropop.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Commercially, <em>She Wolf</em> was a success and topped charts and attained gold and platinum <a href="Record_certification" title="wikilink">certifications</a> in several South American and European territories. However, it performed poorly in the United States and became Shakira's first studio album since <em><a href="D&lt;U+00F3&gt;nde_Est&lt;U+00E1&gt;n_los_Ladrones?" title="wikilink">D&lt;U+00F3&gt;nde Est&lt;U+00E1&gt;n los Ladrones?</a></em> (1998) to miss peaking inside the top 10 after it debuted at number 15 on the US <em><a href="Billboard_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Billboard</a></em> <a href="Billboard_Hot_200" title="wikilink">Hot 200</a> chart.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In May 2010, she wrote and recorded &quot;<a href="Waka_Waka_(This_Time_for_Africa)" title="wikilink">Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)</a>&quot;, the official anthem song of the <a href="2010_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2010 FIFA World Cup</a>, which became a worldwide hit.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Following the worldwide success of &quot;Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)&quot;, Shakira soon began work on her ninth studio album <em>Sale el Sol</em>. She decided to experiment with <a href="merengue_music" title="wikilink">merengue music</a> on the album, saying &quot;I grew up listening to merengue&lt;U+2014&gt;that was a big part of my life, and I was missing it.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Merengue is recognized as the national music of the <a href="Music_of_Dominican_Republic" title="wikilink">Dominican Republic</a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and the singer travelled to the country to work with Dominican songwriter and record producer <a href="El_Cata" title="wikilink">El Cata</a>, resulting in songs like &quot;<a href="Loca_(Shakira_song)" title="wikilink">Loca</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Rabiosa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rabiosa</a>&quot;. Shakira said that the recording of the two songs took place in &quot;this tiny studio in the middle of nowhere&quot;, and that &quot;it wasn't planned, I was just following my instincts.

<p>Armando P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rez, who co-wrote the tracks &quot;Loca&quot; and &quot;Rabiosa&quot;, talked about Shakira's previous album <em>She Wolf</em>, saying &quot;on the last album they tried to <a href="Americanize" class="uri" title="wikilink">Americanize</a> Shakira by giving her the big producers.

<p><em>Sale el Sol</em> is considered to be Shakira's return to her &quot;roots&quot; and is a &quot;fusion between <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a> and <a href="Pop_music" title="wikilink">pop</a> heavily influenced from Latino and Colombian music&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Shakira said there are three &quot;directions&quot; of <em>Sale el Sol</em>: a romantic one, a &quot;very <a href="rock_and_roll" title="wikilink">rock and roll</a>&quot; one, and a &quot;<a href="Latino_Music" title="wikilink">Latino</a>, <a href="tropical_music" title="wikilink">tropical</a>&quot; one.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Explaining the romantic &quot;direction&quot; of the album, she said that it was something &quot;which I hadn't tapped into for the past three years, but it suddenly came to me and I couldn't hold it back.
