<p><strong>Homer Jay Simpson</strong> is a fictional main character in the animated television series <em><a href="The_Simpsons" title="wikilink">The Simpsons</a></em> and father of the <a href="Simpson_family" title="wikilink">eponymous family</a>. He is voiced by <a href="Dan_Castellaneta" title="wikilink">Dan Castellaneta</a> and first appeared on television in <em><a href="The_Tracey_Ullman_Show" title="wikilink">The Tracey Ullman Show</a></em> <a href="The_Simpsons_shorts" title="wikilink">short</a> &quot;<a href="Good_Night_(The_Simpsons_short)" title="wikilink">Good Night</a>&quot; on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist <a href="Matt_Groening" title="wikilink">Matt Groening</a> while he was waiting in the lobby of <a href="James_L._Brooks" title="wikilink">James L. Brooks</a>' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on <em><a href="Life_in_Hell" title="wikilink">Life in Hell</a></em> but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his father Homer Groening. After appearing on <em>The Tracey Ullman Show</em> for three years, the Simpson family got their own series on <a href="Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">Fox</a>, which debuted December 17, 1989.</p>
<p>Homer is the boorish father of the Simpson family. With his wife, <a href="Marge_Simpson" title="wikilink">Marge</a>, he has three children: <a href="Bart_Simpson" title="wikilink">Bart</a>, <a href="Lisa_Simpson" title="wikilink">Lisa</a> and <a href="Maggie_Simpson" title="wikilink">Maggie</a>. As the family's provider, he works at the <a href="Springfield_Nuclear_Power_Plant" title="wikilink">Springfield Nuclear Power Plant</a>. Homer embodies several American <a href="working_class" title="wikilink">working class</a> stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, clumsy, and lazy; however, he is also fiercely devoted to his family. Despite the suburban <a href="Blue-collar_worker" title="wikilink">blue-collar</a> routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences.</p>
<p>In the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of <a href="Walter_Matthau" title="wikilink">Walter Matthau</a>; however, during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the expression of a fuller range of emotions. He has appeared in other media relating to <em>The Simpsons</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; including video games, <em><a href="The_Simpsons_Movie" title="wikilink">The Simpsons Movie</a></em>, <a href="The_Simpsons_Ride" title="wikilink">The Simpsons Ride</a>, commercials and comic books &lt;U+2013&gt; and inspired an entire line of merchandise. His catchphrase, the annoyed grunt &quot;<a href="d&#39;oh!" class="uri" title="wikilink">d'oh!</a>&quot;, has been included in <em><a href="Oxford_Dictionary_of_English" title="wikilink">The New Oxford Dictionary of English</a></em> since 1998 and the <em><a href="Oxford_English_Dictionary" title="wikilink">Oxford English Dictionary</a></em> since 2001.</p>
<p>Homer is one of the most influential fictional characters on television, having been described by the British newspaper <em><a href="The_Sunday_Times" title="wikilink">The Sunday Times</a></em> as &quot;the greatest comic creation of [modern] time&quot;. He was ranked the second greatest cartoon character by <em><a href="TV_Guide" title="wikilink">TV Guide</a></em> and was voted the greatest television character of all-time by <a href="Channel_4" title="wikilink">Channel 4</a> viewers. Castellaneta has earned three <a href="Primetime_Emmy_Award" title="wikilink">Primetime Emmy Awards</a> for <a href="Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Voice-Over_Performance" title="wikilink">Outstanding Voice-Over Performance</a> and a special achievement <a href="Annie_Award" title="wikilink">Annie Award</a> for voicing Homer. In 2000, Homer, along with the rest of his family, was awarded a star on the <a href="Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>.</p>
<h2 id="role-in-the-simpsons">Role in <em>The Simpsons</em></h2>
<p><em>The Simpsons</em> uses a <a href="floating_timeline" title="wikilink">floating timeline</a> in which the characters <a href="Ageless" title="wikilink">do not physically age</a>, and as such the show is generally assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific time periods, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Homer Simpson is the bumbling husband of Marge and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He was raised by his parents, <a href="Mona_Simpson_(The_Simpsons)" title="wikilink">Mona</a> and <a href="Abraham_Simpson" title="wikilink">Abraham Simpson</a>; in the episode &quot;<a href="Mother_Simpson" title="wikilink">Mother Simpson</a>&quot;, (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_7)" title="wikilink">season seven</a>, 1995) it is revealed that Mona went into hiding in the mid-1960s following a run-in with the law.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Homer attended Springfield High School, and in his final year fell in love with <a href="Marge_Simpson" title="wikilink">Marge Bouvier</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Marge later discovered she was pregnant with Bart, and the two were married in a small wedding chapel across the state line.

<p>Homer's age has increased as the series developed; he was 36 in the early episodes,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> 38 in <a href="The_Simpsons_(season_8)" title="wikilink">season eight</a>,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and 40 in the <a href="The_Simpsons_(season_18)" title="wikilink">eighteenth season</a>,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> although even in those seasons his age is inconsistent.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> During <a href="Bill_Oakley" title="wikilink">Bill Oakley</a> and <a href="Josh_Weinstein" title="wikilink">Josh Weinstein</a>'s period as showrunners, they found that as they aged, Homer seemed to become older too, so they increased his age to 38.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

When he realized that animating <em>Life in Hell</em> would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening decided to go in another direction,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family, naming the characters after members of his own family.

<p><img src="Evolution_of_Homer.jpg" title="fig:Homer&#39;s design has been changed several times over the course of the series.

Groening decided that this would be too distracting though, and redesigned the ear to look normal. He still draws the ear as a 'G' when he draws pictures of Homer for fans.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The basic shape of Homer's head is described by director <a href="Mark_Kirkland" title="wikilink">Mark Kirkland</a> as a tube-shaped coffee can with a salad bowl on top. Bart's head is also coffee can shaped, while spheres are used for Marge, Lisa and Maggie.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> During the shorts, the animators experimented with Homer's mouth movements when talking and at one point his mouth would stretch out back &quot;beyond his beardline&quot;, but this was stopped when it got &quot;out of control.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In some early episodes, Homer's hair was rounded rather than sharply pointed because animation director <a href="Wes_Archer" title="wikilink">Wes Archer</a> felt it should look disheveled. Homer's hair later evolved to appear consistently pointed.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> During the first three seasons, Homer's design for some close-up shots included small lines which were meant to be eyebrows. Matt Groening strongly disliked them and they were eventually dropped.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>In the <a href="The_Simpsons_(season_7)" title="wikilink">season seven</a> (1995) episode &quot;<a href="Treehouse_of_Horror_VI" title="wikilink">Treehouse of Horror VI</a>&quot;, Homer was computer animated into a <a href="3D_computer_graphics" title="wikilink">three dimensional</a> character for the first time for the &quot;Homer<sup>3</sup>&quot; segment of the episode. The computer animation directors at <a href="Pacific_Data_Images" title="wikilink">Pacific Data Images</a> worked hard not to &quot;reinvent the character&quot;.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> In the final minute of the segment, the 3D Homer ends up in a real world, live-action <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>.

He was redesigned to be heavier, one the hairs on top of his head was removed and an extra line was placed under the eye. A similar design was used in subsequent flashforward episodes.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="voice">Voice</h3>

<p>Homer's voice is performed by <a href="Dan_Castellaneta" title="wikilink">Dan Castellaneta</a>, who voices numerous other characters, including Abraham Simpson, <a href="Krusty_the_Clown" title="wikilink">Krusty the Clown</a>, <a href="Barney_Gumble" title="wikilink">Barney Gumble</a>, <a href="Groundskeeper_Willie" title="wikilink">Groundskeeper Willie</a>, <a href="Mayor_Quimby" title="wikilink">Mayor Quimby</a> and <a href="Hans_Moleman" title="wikilink">Hans Moleman</a>. Castellaneta had been part of the regular cast of <em><a href="The_Tracey_Ullman_Show" title="wikilink">The Tracey Ullman Show</a></em> and had previously done some voice-over work in <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a> alongside his wife <a href="Deb_Lacusta" title="wikilink">Deb Lacusta</a>. Voices were needed for the <a href="The_Simpsons_shorts" title="wikilink">Simpsons shorts</a>, so the producers decided to ask Castellaneta and fellow cast member <a href="Julie_Kavner" title="wikilink">Julie Kavner</a> to voice Homer and Marge rather than hire more actors.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Homer's voice sounds different in the shorts and first few seasons of the half-hour show than it does in the majority of the series. The voice began as a loose impression of <a href="Walter_Matthau" title="wikilink">Walter Matthau</a>, but Castellaneta could not &quot;get enough power behind that voice&quot;,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> and could not sustain his Matthau impression for the nine to ten hour long recording sessions so had to find something easier.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Castellaneta &quot;dropped the voice down&quot;,<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and developed it into a more versatile and humorous voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show, allowing Homer to cover a fuller range of emotions.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Castellaneta's normal speaking voice has no similarity to Homer's.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> To perform Homer's voice, Castellaneta lowers his chin to his chest,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> and is said to &quot;let his IQ go&quot;.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> While in this state, he has ad-libbed several of Homer's least intelligent comments,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> such as the line &quot;I am so smart, s-m-r-t&quot; from the episode &quot;<a href="Homer_Goes_to_College" title="wikilink">Homer Goes to College</a>&quot; (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_5)" title="wikilink">season five</a>, 1993) which was a genuine mistake made by Castellaneta during recording.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Castellaneta likes to stay in character during recording sessions,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> and tries to visualize a scene in his mind so that he can give the proper voice to it.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Despite Homer's fame, Castellaneta claims he is rarely recognized in public, &quot;except, maybe, by a die-hard fan&quot;.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;<a href="Homer&#39;s_Barbershop_Quartet" title="wikilink">Homer's Barbershop Quartet</a>&quot; (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_5)" title="wikilink">season five</a>, 1993) is the only episode where Homer's voice was provided by someone other than Castellaneta. The episode features Homer forming a <a href="barbershop_quartet" title="wikilink">barbershop quartet</a> called The Be Sharps and at some points, his singing voice is provided by a member of <a href="The_Dapper_Dans" title="wikilink">The Dapper Dans</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The Dapper Dans had recorded the singing parts for all four members of The Be Sharps. Their singing was intermixed with the normal voice actor's voices, often with a regular voice actor singing the melody and the Dapper Dans providing backup.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>Until 1998, Castellaneta was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing for casting of new voices.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> However, the dispute was soon resolved and he received $125,000 per episode until 2004 when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The issue was resolved a month later,<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> and Castellaneta earned $250,000 per episode.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> After salary re-negotiations in 2008, the voice actors receive approximately $400,000 per episode.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>

<p>Executive producer <a href="Al_Jean" title="wikilink">Al Jean</a> notes that in <em>The Simpsons</em>' writing room, &quot;everyone loves writing for Homer&quot;, and many of his adventures are based on experiences of the writers.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Homer's behavior has changed a number of times through the run of the series. He was originally &quot;very angry&quot; and oppressive toward Bart, but these characteristics were toned down somewhat as his persona was further explored.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> In early seasons, Homer appeared concerned that his family was going to make him look bad; however, in later episodes he was less anxious about how he was perceived by others.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> In the first several years, Homer was often portrayed as sweet and sincere, but during <a href="Mike_Scully" title="wikilink">Mike Scully</a>'s tenure as executive producer (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_9)" title="wikilink">seasons nine</a>, 1997 to <a href="The_Simpsons_(season_12)" title="wikilink">twelve</a>, 2001), he became more of &quot;a boorish, self-aggrandizing oaf&quot;.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Chris Suellentrop of <em><a href="Slate_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Slate</a></em> wrote, &quot;under Scully's tenure, The Simpsons became, well, a cartoon.

<p>The writers have made Homer's intelligence appear to decline over the years; they explain this was not done intentionally, but it was necessary in order to top previous jokes.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> For example, in &quot;<a href="When_You_Dish_Upon_a_Star" title="wikilink">When You Dish Upon a Star</a>&quot;, (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_10)" title="wikilink">season 10</a>, 1998) the writers included a scene where Homer admits that he can not read. The writers debated including this plot twist because it would contradict previous scenes in which Homer does read, but eventually they decided to keep the joke because they found it humorous. The writers often debate how far to go in portraying Homer's stupidity; one suggested rule is that &quot;he can never forget his own name&quot;.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="personality">Personality</h3>
<p>Homer's personality and comic efficacy lies in his frequent bouts of stupidity, laziness and explosive anger. He has a low intelligence level, described by director <a href="David_Silverman" title="wikilink">David Silverman</a> as &quot;creatively brilliant in his stupidity&quot;.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Homer also shows immense apathy towards work, is overweight, and &quot;is devoted to his stomach&quot;.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> His short attention span is evidenced by his impulsive decisions to engage in various hobbies and enterprises, only to &quot;change ... his mind when things go badly&quot;.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Homer often spends his evenings drinking <a href="Duff_Beer" title="wikilink">Duff Beer</a> at <a href="Moe&#39;s_Tavern" title="wikilink">Moe's Tavern</a> and, as shown in the episode &quot;<a href="Duffless" class="uri" title="wikilink">Duffless</a>&quot; (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_4)" title="wikilink">season four</a>, 1993), is a borderline <a href="alcoholic" class="uri" title="wikilink">alcoholic</a>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> He is very envious of his neighbors, the <a href="Flanders_family" title="wikilink">Flanders family</a>, and is easily enraged by <a href="Bart_Simpson" title="wikilink">Bart</a>: Homer will often strangle Bart on impulse in a cartoonish manner. The first instance of Homer strangling Bart was in the short &quot;Family Portrait&quot;. Matt Groening's rule was that Homer could only strangle Bart impulsively, never with pre-meditation, and that it would always be over quickly.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Another of the original ideas entertained by Groening was that Homer would &quot;always get his comeuppance or Bart had to strangle him back&quot;, but this was dropped.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> He shows no compunction about expressing his rage, and does not attempt to hide his actions from people outside the family.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> While Homer has repeatedly upset people and caused all sorts of mayhem in <a href="Springfield_(The_Simpsons)" title="wikilink">Springfield</a>, these events are usually the result of either his intense temper or a lack of foresight rather than any malice. Except for expressing annoyance at <a href="Ned_Flanders" title="wikilink">Ned Flanders</a>, Homer's destructive actions are usually unintentional. <img src="HomerStranglesBart.jpg" title="fig:The first sketch of Homer strangling Bart, drawn in 1988" alt="The first sketch of Homer strangling Bart, drawn in 1988" width="200" /> Homer has complex relationships with all three of his children. He often berates Bart, but the two commonly share adventures and are sometimes allies. Homer and Lisa have opposite personalities and he usually overlooks Lisa's talents, but when made aware of his neglect does everything he can to help her. He sometimes forgets that Maggie even exists, although Homer has often tried to bond with her; &quot;daddy&quot; was her first word. While Homer's thoughtless antics often upset his family, he has also revealed himself to be a surprisingly caring father and husband: in &quot;<a href="Lisa_the_Beauty_Queen" title="wikilink">Lisa the Beauty Queen</a>&quot;, (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_4)" title="wikilink">season four</a>, 1992) he sold his cherished ride on the Duff blimp and used the money to enter Lisa in a beauty pageant so she could feel better about herself;<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> in &quot;<a href="Rosebud_(The_Simpsons)" title="wikilink">Rosebud</a>&quot;, (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_5)" title="wikilink">season five</a>, 1993) he gave up his chance at wealth to allow Maggie to keep a cherished teddy bear;<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> in &quot;<a href="Radio_Bart" title="wikilink">Radio Bart</a>&quot;, (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_3)" title="wikilink">season three</a>, 1992) he spearheaded an attempt to dig Bart out after he had fallen down a well;<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> and in &quot;<a href="A_Milhouse_Divided" title="wikilink">A Milhouse Divided</a>&quot;, (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_8)" title="wikilink">season eight</a>, 1996) he arranged a surprise second wedding with Marge to make up for their unsatisfactory first ceremony.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Homer however has a poor relationship with his father <a href="Abraham_Simpson" title="wikilink">Abraham &quot;Grampa&quot; Simpson</a>, whom he placed in a <a href="nursing_home" title="wikilink">nursing home</a> as soon as he could.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The Simpson family will often do their best to avoid unnecessary contact with Grampa, but Homer has shown feelings of love for his father from time to time.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>Homer is &quot;a (happy) slave to his various appetites&quot;,<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> and would gladly sell his soul to the devil in exchange for a single doughnut.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> He has a vacuous mind but is still able to retain a great amount of knowledge about very specific subjects. Homer&lt;U+2019&gt;s brief periods of intelligence are overshadowed however by much longer and consistent periods of ignorance, forgetfulness, and stupidity. Homer has a low <a href="Intelligence_quotient" title="wikilink">IQ</a> of 55 which has variously been attributed to the hereditary &quot;Simpson Gene&quot;,<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> his alcohol problem, exposure to radioactive waste, repetitive cranial trauma,<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> and a crayon lodged in the <a href="frontal_lobe" title="wikilink">frontal lobe</a> of his brain.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> In the episode &quot;<a href="HOMR" class="uri" title="wikilink">HOMR</a>&quot; (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_12)" title="wikilink">season 12</a>, 2001) Homer had surgery to remove the crayon from his brain, boosting his IQ to 105, but although he bonded very well with Lisa, his newfound capacity for understanding and reason made him less happy and he had <a href="Moe_Szyslak" title="wikilink">Moe</a> reinsert the crayon, causing his intelligence to return to its previous level.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Homer often debates with his own mind, which is expressed in voiceover. His brain has a record of giving him dubious advice, sometimes helping him make the right decisions, but often failing spectacularly. It has even become completely frustrated and, through sound effects, walked out on him.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Homer's conversations with his brain were used several times during the fourth season, but were later phased out after the producers &quot;used every possible permutation&quot;.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> These exchanges were often introduced because they filled time and were easy for the animators to work on.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<p>Homer Simpson is an &quot;everyman&quot; and embodies several American stereotypes of working class <a href="blue-collar_worker" title="wikilink">blue-collar</a> men: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, clumsy and a borderline alcoholic.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> Matt Groening describes him as &quot;completely ruled by his impulses&quot;.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Dan Castellaneta calls him &quot;a dog trapped in a man's body&quot;, adding, &quot;He's incredibly loyal &lt;U+2013&gt; not entirely clean &lt;U+2013&gt; but you gotta love him.&quot;<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> In his book <em><a href="Planet_Simpson" title="wikilink">Planet Simpson</a></em>, author <a href="Chris_Turner_(author)" title="wikilink">Chris Turner</a> describes Homer as &quot;the most American of the Simpsons&quot; and believes that while the other Simpson family members could be changed to other nationalities, Homer is &quot;pure American&quot;.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> In the book <em>God in the Details: American Religion in Popular Culture</em>, the authors comment that &quot;Homer's progress (or lack thereof) reveals a character who can do the right thing, if accidentally or begrudgingly.&quot;<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> The book <em><a href="The_Simpsons_and_Philosophy:_The_D&#39;oh!_of_Homer" title="wikilink">The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer</a></em> includes a chapter analyzing Homer's character from the perspective of <a href="Aristotelianism" title="wikilink">Aristotelian</a> <a href="virtue_ethics" title="wikilink">virtue ethics</a>. Raja Halwani writes that Homer's &quot;love of life&quot; is an admirable character trait, &quot;for many people are tempted to see in Homer nothing but buffoonery and immorality.  He is not politically correct, he is more than happy to judge others, and he certainly does not seem to be obsessed with his health. These qualities might not make Homer an admirable <em>person</em>, but they do make him admirable in some ways, and, more importantly, makes us crave him and the Homer Simpsons of this world.&quot;<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> In 2008, <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> justified designating <em>The Simpsons</em> as a television classic by stating, &quot;we all hail Simpson patriarch Homer because his joy is as palpable as his stupidity is stunning&quot;.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>

<p>Despite Homer's embodiment of American culture, his influence has spread to other parts of the world.

<h3 id="doh">D'oh!</h3>

<p>Homer's catchphrase is the annoyed grunt &quot;d'oh&quot; that is typically uttered when he injures himself, realizes that he has done something stupid, or when something bad has happened or is about to happen to him. During the voice recording session for a <em><a href="The_Tracey_Ullman_Show" title="wikilink">Tracey Ullman Show</a></em> short, Homer was required to utter what was written in the script as an &quot;annoyed grunt&quot;. Dan Castellaneta rendered it as a drawn out &quot;d'ooooooh&quot;. This was inspired by <a href="Jimmy_Finlayson" title="wikilink">Jimmy Finlayson</a>, the mustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in 33 <a href="Laurel_and_Hardy" title="wikilink">Laurel and Hardy</a> films. Finlayson had used the term as a <a href="minced_oath" title="wikilink">minced oath</a> to stand in for the word &quot;<a href="damnation" title="wikilink">Damn</a>!&quot; <a href="Matt_Groening" title="wikilink">Matt Groening</a> felt that it would better suit the timing of animation if it were spoken faster. Castellaneta then shortened it to a quickly uttered &quot;d'oh!&quot;<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> The first intentional use of d'oh! occurred the Ullman short &quot;The Krusty the Clown Show&quot;,<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> (1989) and its first usage in the series was in the series premiere, &quot;<a href="Simpsons_Roasting_on_an_Open_Fire" title="wikilink">Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
