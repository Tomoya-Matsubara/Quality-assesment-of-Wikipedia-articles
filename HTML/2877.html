<p><strong>Master Chief Petty Officer John-117</strong>, commonly called <strong>Master Chief</strong>, is the fictional protagonist of the <a href="Halo_universe" title="wikilink"><em>Halo</em> universe</a>, created by <a href="Bungie_Studios" title="wikilink">Bungie Studios</a>, and is a <a href="player_character" title="wikilink">player character</a> in the trilogy of science fiction <a href="first-person_shooter" title="wikilink">first-person shooter</a> <a href="video_game" title="wikilink">video games</a> <em><a href="Halo:_Combat_Evolved" title="wikilink">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></em>, <em><a href="Halo_2" title="wikilink">Halo 2</a></em>, and <em><a href="Halo_3" title="wikilink">Halo 3</a></em>. Outside of video games, the Master Chief appears in the novels <em><a href="Halo:_The_Fall_of_Reach" title="wikilink">Halo: The Fall of Reach</a></em>, <em><a href="Halo:_The_Flood" title="wikilink">Halo: The Flood</a></em>, <em><a href="Halo:_First_Strike" title="wikilink">Halo: First Strike</a></em>, and <em><a href="Halo:_Uprising" title="wikilink">Halo: Uprising</a></em>, and has cameos in <em><a href="Halo:_Ghosts_of_Onyx" title="wikilink">Halo: Ghosts of Onyx</a></em> and the <em><a href="Halo_Graphic_Novel" title="wikilink">Halo Graphic Novel</a></em>. He is voiced by <a href="Steve_Downes" title="wikilink">Steve Downes</a> in the video games in which he appears.</p>
<p>The Master Chief is one of the most visible symbols of the <a href="Halo_(series)" title="wikilink"><em>Halo</em> series</a>. Originally designed by Marcus Lehto, Rob McLees, and Shi Kai Wang, the character is a towering and faceless <a href="cybernetics" title="wikilink">cybernetically</a> enhanced supersoldier; he is never seen without his armor or helmet. The character has been called an icon, a relative newcomer among more established franchise characters, such as <a href="Mario" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mario</a>, <a href="Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(character)" title="wikilink">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, and <a href="Lara_Croft" title="wikilink">Lara Croft</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <em><a href="Electronic_Gaming_Monthly" title="wikilink">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a></em> named the Master Chief as the eighth greatest video game character ever. Conversely, the Chief's silent nature during gameplay has led to criticisms that the character is one-dimensional and unbelievable.</p>

<p><img src="Masterchief_sheik.png" title="fig:Shi Kai Wang&#39;s sketch which became the basis for the Master Chief" alt="Shi Kai Wang&#39;s sketch which became the basis for the Master Chief" /> The task of developing the Master Chief for the character's first appearance in <em><a href="Halo:_Combat_Evolved" title="wikilink">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></em> fell on Rob McLees and the project's Art Director, Marcus Lehto. Eventually, Shi Kai Wang was hired for conceptual art.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> One of Wang's sketches was accepted and became the basis for the Master Chief. However, after Wang's version was converted to a 3-D model, it was decided the Master Chief looked too slender, &quot;almost effeminate&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The Master Chief was subsequently bulked up to the version currently found in the games.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Similarly, the Chief's armor went through various changes, such as adding an antenna, which was removed later in development, and a green tint.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In an interview on creating believable video game characters, Bungie's <a href="Joseph_Staten" title="wikilink">Joseph Staten</a> noted that, until the Master Chief was created, Bungie had not considered how to immerse people in the world of <em>Halo</em>. &quot;Master Chief is really what kicked off the creativity,&quot; he said, &quot;in terms of how people react to him. He's a space marine in really cool green armor.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Steve Downes, who voices the Master Chief, is a disc jockey and voice actor who had never played video games before <em>Halo</em>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <a href="Martin_O&#39;Donnell" title="wikilink">Martin O'Donnell</a>, Bungie's music director, had worked with Downes on a previous video game, <em><a href="Septerra_Core:_Legacy_of_the_Creator" title="wikilink">Septerra Core: Legacy of the Creator</a></em>, and recommended him for the part.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Downes has never appeared at Bungie or Microsoft events, and believes that the Master Chief is left masked because &quot;[the character's identity] is really in the eye of the player&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="personality">Personality</h3>
<p>Steve Downes said that his voice acting was based entirely on Bungie's written character description provided , which specified a character similar to <a href="Clint_Eastwood" title="wikilink">Clint Eastwood</a> and of few words. In a <a href="podcast" class="uri" title="wikilink">podcast</a> interview, the actor noted that, during the recording, he was given a fair amount of creative leeway to develop the Chief's personality.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In the games, the Master Chief never speaks during player-controlled gameplay, making him almost a <a href="silent_protagonist" title="wikilink">silent protagonist</a>. Even during cutscenes, the character generally speaks sparingly. Bungie Studios' Frank O'Connor has described the Chief as &quot;so quiet and so invisible, literally, that the player gets to pretend they're the Chief. The player gets to inhabit those shoes [and] apply their own personality.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Bungie concept artist Eddie Smith described the Master Chief as &quot;pretty much the consummate professional. He does his job, walks off, doesn't even get the girl, he's that cool he doesn't need her.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Although the Master Chief is usually depicted as calm, quiet, and wryly cynical, some reviewers stated that Eric Nylund's portrayal of the character in <em><a href="Halo:_The_Fall_of_Reach" title="wikilink">Halo: The Fall of Reach</a></em> deviates significantly from the treatment found in the games and other media.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Entirely encased in heavy armor and standing seven feet tall, the Chief inspires awe and terror in friends and foes alike.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Despite his cold exterior, Master Chief cares about his fellow soldiers, especially the Spartan-IIs with whom he has trained.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> At one point, the Master Chief risks injury in a massive explosion to save a fellow Spartan,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and withholds combat information on the threat of the <a href="Flood_(Halo)" title="wikilink">Flood</a>, an alien parasite, after realizing that its disclosure would mean the death of <a href="Sergeant_Major_A.J._Johnson" title="wikilink">Sergeant Avery Johnson</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>During his training, the Master Chief is taught by <a href="Chief_Petty_Officer" title="wikilink">Chief Petty Officer</a> <a href="List_of_Halo_characters#Franklin_Mendez" title="wikilink">Franklin Mendez</a> to sacrifice lives only when necessary and to understand the difference between &quot;wasting lives and spending lives.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> While in the Chi Ceti system, one of the Master Chief's fellow Spartans and best friend, Samuel-034, suffers an irreparable breach in his armor.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Sam stays behind to detonate explosives, while the Master Chief and another comrade evacuate the ship. Although the Chief would have preferred to die with his friend, he tells himself that he needs to &quot;live and fight another day&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In <em><a href="Halo:_First_Strike" title="wikilink">Halo: First Strike</a></em>, <a href="List_of_Halo_characters#Catherine_Halsey" title="wikilink">Dr. Catherine Halsey</a> tries to teach him to save every single life possible.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the Master Chief's excellent combat record, many in the <a href="United_Nations_Space_Command" title="wikilink">United Nations Space Command</a> (UNSC), the military unit to which he belongs, distrust him. <a href="Characters_in_the_Halo_series#Antonio_Silva" title="wikilink">Antonio Silva</a>, an <a href="United_Nations_Space_Command#Orbital_Drop_Shock_Troopers" title="wikilink">Orbital Drop Shock Trooper</a>, exemplifies this attitude,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and considers the Master Chief a freak product of an experiment that should never be repeated.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> While the Chief resents Silva's dishonor to his fallen comrades' memory, he is also loyal to the chain of command, and remains quiet.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Despite these explorations of the character's personality, O'Connor said in an interview that revealing the face of the Chief is not as important as revealing the events going on around the character.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="outward-appearance">Outward appearance</h3>
<p>In the video games, the Master Chief is never seen without his armor. In the last cutscene of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em>, the Chief removes his helmet, but camera movement hides his face; Bungie Studios did this intentionally to allow the player to better become the Master Chief.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The only physical description of the Master Chief comes from the novels. During a briefing in <em><a href="Halo:_The_Flood" title="wikilink">Halo: The Flood</a></em>, the Chief is described as tall with short hair, serious eyes, and strong features.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> His skin is &quot;too white&quot;, testifying to the amount of time he spends in his armor.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> With his armor, the Master Chief stands about seven feet (2.13 m) tall and weighs one thousand pounds (450 kg);<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> without it, the Chief still stands six feet, six inches (1.98 m) tall and weighs 287 pounds (130 kg).<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="halo-the-fall-of-reach"><em>Halo: The Fall of Reach</em></h3>

<p>The Master Chief's backstory is never explained in the video games. A prequel of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em>, the 2001 novel <em><a href="Halo:_The_Fall_of_Reach" title="wikilink">The Fall of Reach</a></em>, reveals much of the character's history and was released as a companion to the game. The Master Chief, originally named John, was born in 2511 and first lived with his family on the human colony planet Eridanus 2. Large for his six years of age, and approximately a foot above his school peers, he is described as a typical boy with brown hair, freckles and a gap between his two front teeth.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In 2517, John and seventy-four other children his age are covertly taken from their homes and replaced with <a href="United_Nations_Space_Command#Flash_clones" title="wikilink">flash clones</a> to hide the kidnapping. The original children are brought to planet <a href="Reach_(Halo)" title="wikilink">Reach</a>, one of the UNSC's headquarters, to begin intense physical and psychological training to become <a href="SPARTAN-II_Project" title="wikilink">SPARTAN-II</a> supersoldiers.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> They are assigned new identification numbers instead of last names; John becomes known as John-117.

<p>Following the Spartans' first successful operation, John-117 is briefed on the threat posed by the <a href="Covenant_(Halo)" title="wikilink">Covenant</a>, a theocratic alliance of alien races, and witnesses the utter devastation wrought by a single ship.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The Spartans are first sent to the Damascus Materials Testing Facility on the planet Chi Ceti 4 to retrieve the <a href="MJOLNIR_battle_armor" title="wikilink">MJOLNIR Mark IV armor</a>.

<p>In 2552, the Covenant invades the human world of Sigma Octanus and occupies one of its cities, Cote D'Azure.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Following a failed Marine assault, John-117 and three teams of Spartans are sent to destroy the Covenant force with a nuclear warhead.

In <em>Halo: The Flood</em>, the 2003 novelization of the video game, the Chief is likewise the main character.

On exiting of <a href="slipspace" class="uri" title="wikilink">slipspace</a>, the <em><a href="Pillar_of_Autumn" title="wikilink">Pillar of Autumn</a></em> is attacked by the Covenant and crash lands on <a href="Halo_(megastructure)" title="wikilink">Halo</a>, a ring-shaped megastructure.

While fighting the Covenant, the Master Chief and Cortana learn that Halo was created by an ancient race, the <a href="Forerunner_(Halo)" title="wikilink">Forerunners</a>, as a last line of defense against an alien parasite called the <a href="Flood_(Halo)" title="wikilink">Flood</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The Covenant accidentally releases the Flood, which begins to spread across the ring.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> At the request of the installation's resident AI <a href="343_Guilty_Spark" title="wikilink">343 Guilty Spark</a>, the Master Chief retrieves the Index, a device used to activate Halo's defenses and eliminate the Flood. However, Guilty Spark neglects to inform the Master Chief that Halo would accomplish this by destroying all sentient life in a vast radius, essentially starving the Flood to death.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Cortana intervenes to prevent the activation of Halo.

<p>In an article in <em><a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Time</a></em>, Lev Grossman stated that the Master Chief represents a &quot;new kind of celebrity for a new and profoundly weird millennium&quot; and is a symbol of the increasing legitimacy of video games as an art form.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Sydney_Morning_Herald" title="wikilink">The Sydney Morning Herald</a></em> simply described the Chief as &quot;iconic&quot;.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> <em><a href="Electronic_Gaming_Monthly" title="wikilink">EGM</a></em> noted that the Master Chief, in half a decade had become the <a href="de_facto" title="wikilink">de facto</a> symbol for the <a href="Xbox" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xbox</a>, and a new generation of gamers to boot.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The recognition of the Master Chief has spread to mainstream culture; <a href="Madame_Tussauds" title="wikilink">Madame Tussauds</a> in <a href="Las_Vegas" title="wikilink">Las Vegas</a> has developed a wax sculpture of the Chief.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> At the ceremony, <a href="Pete_Wentz" title="wikilink">Pete Wentz</a> of <a href="Fall_Out_Boy" title="wikilink">Fall Out Boy</a> said that the &quot;Master Chief is as much of a hero today as characters like <a href="Spider-Man" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spider-Man</a>, <a href="Frodo_Baggins" title="wikilink">Frodo</a>, and <a href="Luke_Skywalker" title="wikilink">Luke Skywalker</a> were for previous generations.&quot;<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

<p>Roger Travis, associate professor of classics at the <a href="University_of_Connecticut" title="wikilink">University of Connecticut</a>, compared the Master Chief to the epic hero <a href="Aeneas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aeneas</a>, in that both superhuman characters save a civilization by defeating strong enemies in a martial setting. The audience is intended to become immersed and to identify with the protagonist similarly in both stories.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> saw in the Master Chief elements of Jon 6725416, a character in <a href="Christopher_Rowley" title="wikilink">Christopher Rowley</a>'s novel <em>Starhammer</em>.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Reviewers have suggested that the name John-117 could be a Biblical reference.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>Reaction to the Master Chief as a character is generally mixed. Some reviewers see the character's silent nature as a strength;<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> others say that this quality leaves him insufficiently developed and believable.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Similarly, some critics see the Chief as a <a href="stock_character" title="wikilink">stock</a> action hero, with little added dimension.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>

Ask him. / <strong>Master Chief</strong>: Is this true? / <strong>343 Guilty Spark</strong>: More or less. Technically, this installation's pulse has a maximum effective radius of twenty-five thousand light years. But, once the others follow suit, this galaxy will be quite devoid of life, or at least any life with sufficient biomass to sustain the Flood. (pause) But you already knew that.
