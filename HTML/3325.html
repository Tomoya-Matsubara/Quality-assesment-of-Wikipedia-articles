<p><strong>Henry Martyn</strong> (18 February 1781 &lt;U+2013&gt; 16 October 1812) was an <a href="Anglican" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglican</a> priest and <a href="missionary" class="uri" title="wikilink">missionary</a> to the peoples of <a href="British_Raj" title="wikilink">India</a> and <a href="Qajar_dynasty" title="wikilink">Persia</a>. Born in <a href="Truro,_Cornwall" title="wikilink">Truro</a>, <a href="Cornwall" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cornwall</a>, he was educated at <a href="Truro_Grammar_School" title="wikilink">Truro Grammar School</a> and <a href="St_John&#39;s_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">St John's College, Cambridge</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> A chance encounter with <a href="Charles_Simeon" title="wikilink">Charles Simeon</a> led him to become a missionary. He was ordained a priest in the <a href="Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Church of England</a> and became a chaplain for the <a href="British_East_India_Company" title="wikilink">British East India Company</a>.</p>
<p>Martyn arrived in India in April 1806, where he preached and occupied himself in the study of linguistics. He translated the whole of the <a href="New_Testament" title="wikilink">New Testament</a> into <a href="Urdu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Urdu</a>, <a href="Persian_language" title="wikilink">Persian</a> and Judaeo-Persic. He also translated the <a href="Psalms" class="uri" title="wikilink">Psalms</a> into Persian and the <a href="Book_of_Common_Prayer" title="wikilink">Book of Common Prayer</a> into Urdu. From India, he set out for <a href="Bushire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bushire</a>, <a href="Shiraz,_Iran" title="wikilink">Shiraz</a>, <a href="Isfahan_(city)" title="wikilink">Isfahan</a>, and <a href="Tabriz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tabriz</a>.</p>
<p>Martyn was seized with fever, and, though the plague was raging at <a href="Tokat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tokat</a>, he was forced to stop there, unable to continue. On <a href="16_October" title="wikilink">16 October</a> <a href="1812" class="uri" title="wikilink">1812</a> he died. He was remembered for his courage, selflessness and his religious devotion. In parts of the <a href="Anglican_Communion" title="wikilink">Anglican Communion</a> he is celebrated with a <a href="Lesser_Festival_(Church_of_England)" title="wikilink">Lesser Festival</a> on <a href="19_October" title="wikilink">19 October</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Martyn was born in <a href="Truro,_Cornwall" title="wikilink">Truro</a>, <a href="Cornwall" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cornwall</a>. His father, John Martyn, was a &quot;captain&quot; or mine-agent at <a href="Gwennap" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gwennap</a>. As a boy, he was educated at Truro grammar school under Dr Cardew and he entered <a href="St_John&#39;s_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">St John's College, Cambridge</a>, in the autumn of 1797, and was <a href="Senior_Wrangler" title="wikilink">senior wrangler</a> and first Smith's prizeman in 1801. In 1802, he was chosen as a fellow of his college.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>He had intended to go to the bar, but in the October term of 1802 he chanced to hear <a href="Charles_Simeon" title="wikilink">Charles Simeon</a> speaking of the good done in India by a single <a href="Mission_(Christian)" title="wikilink">missionary</a>, <a href="William_Carey_(missionary)" title="wikilink">William Carey</a>, and some time afterwards he read the life of <a href="David_Brainerd" title="wikilink">David Brainerd</a>, a missionary to the <a href="Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">Native Americans</a>. He resolved, accordingly, to become a missionary himself. On <a href="22_October" title="wikilink">22 October</a> <a href="1803" class="uri" title="wikilink">1803</a>, he was ordained deacon at <a href="Ely,_Cambridgeshire" title="wikilink">Ely</a>, and afterwards priest, and served as Simeon's curate at the church of Holy Trinity, taking charge of the neighbouring parish of <a href="Lolworth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lolworth</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="missionary-work">Missionary work</h2>
<p>Martyn wanted to offer his services to the <a href="Church_Missionary_Society" title="wikilink">Church Missionary Society</a>, when a financial disaster in Cornwall deprived him and his unmarried sister of the income their father had left for them. It was necessary for Martyn to earn an income that would support his sister as well as himself.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He accordingly obtained a chaplaincy under the <a href="British_East_India_Company" title="wikilink">British East India Company</a> and left for <a href="British_Raj" title="wikilink">India</a> on <a href="5_July" title="wikilink">5 July</a> <a href="1805" class="uri" title="wikilink">1805</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> On his voyage to the East, Martyn happened to be present at the <a href="British_Empire" title="wikilink">British</a> <a href="Battle_of_Blaauwberg" title="wikilink">conquest</a> of the <a href="Cape_Colony" title="wikilink">Cape Colony</a> on <a href="8_January" title="wikilink">8 January</a> <a href="1806" class="uri" title="wikilink">1806</a>. He spent that day tending to the dying soldiers and was distressed by seeing the horrors of war. He would come away feeling that it was Britain's destiny to convert, not colonize, the world.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He wrote in his diary:</p>

<h3 id="india">India</h3>
<p>Martyn arrived in India in April 1806, and for some months he was stationed at Aldeen, near <a href="Serampur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serampur</a>. In October 1806, he proceeded to <a href="Danapur" title="wikilink">Dinapur</a>, where he was soon able to conduct worship among the locals in the vernacular, and established schools.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In April 1809, he was transferred to <a href="Cawnpore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cawnpore</a>, where he preached to British and Indians in his own compound, in spite of interruptions and threats from local non-Christians.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>He occupied himself in linguistic study, and had already, during his residence at Dinapur, been engaged in revising the sheets of his <a href="Hindustani_language" title="wikilink">Hindustani</a> version of the <a href="New_Testament" title="wikilink">New Testament</a>. He now translated the whole of the New Testament into <a href="Urdu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Urdu</a> also, and into <a href="Persian_language" title="wikilink">Persian</a> twice. He translated the <a href="Psalms" class="uri" title="wikilink">Psalms</a> into Persian, the Gospels into Judaeo-Persic, and the <a href="Book_of_Common_Prayer" title="wikilink">Book of Common Prayer</a> into Urdu, in spite of ill-health and &quot;the pride, pedantry and fury of his chief munshi Sabat.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Ordered by the doctors to take a sea voyage, he obtained leave to go to Persia and correct his Persian New Testament. From there, he wanted to go to <a href="Arabia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arabia</a>, and there compose an <a href="Arabic_language" title="wikilink">Arabic</a> version.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> On <a href="1_October" title="wikilink">1 October</a> <a href="1810" class="uri" title="wikilink">1810</a>, having seen his work at Cawnpore rewarded on the previous day by the opening of a church, he left for <a href="Calcutta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calcutta</a>, from where he sailed on <a href="7_January" title="wikilink">7 January</a> <a href="1811" class="uri" title="wikilink">1811</a> for <a href="Bombay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bombay</a>. The ship reached port on his thirtieth birthday.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="final-voyage-and-death">Final voyage and death</h2>
<p>From Bombay he set out for <a href="Bushire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bushire</a>, bearing letters from <a href="John_Malcolm" title="wikilink">Sir John Malcolm</a> to men of position there, as also at <a href="Shiraz,_Iran" title="wikilink">Shiraz</a> and <a href="Isfahan_(city)" title="wikilink">Isfahan</a>. After an exhausting journey from the coast he reached Shiraz, and was soon plunged into discussion with the disputants of all classes, &quot;Sufi, Muslim, Jew, and Jewish Muslim, even Armenian, all anxious to test their powers of argument with the first English priest who had visited them.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> He next traveled to <a href="Tabriz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tabriz</a> to attempt to present the <a href="Shah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shah</a> with his translation of the New Testament, which proved unsuccessful. Sir <a href="Gore_Ouseley" title="wikilink">Gore Ouseley</a>, the British ambassador to the Shah, was unable to bring about a meeting, but did deliver the manuscript. Although Martyn could not present the Bible in person, the Shah later wrote him a letter:</p>

<p>At this time, he was seized with fever, and after a temporary recovery, had to seek a change of climate. He set off for <a href="Istanbul" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a>, where he intended to return on furlough to England to regain his strength and recruit help for the missions in India.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> On <a href="12_September" title="wikilink">12 September</a> <a href="1812" class="uri" title="wikilink">1812</a>, he started with two <a href="Armenia" title="wikilink">Armenian</a> servants and crossed the <a href="Aras_River" title="wikilink">Aras River</a>. Urged on from place to place by their <a href="Tatar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tatar</a> guide, they rode from Tabriz to <a href="Yerevan" title="wikilink">Erivan</a>, from Erivan to <a href="Kars,_Turkey" title="wikilink">Kars</a>, and from Kars to <a href="Erzurum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Erzurum</a>. They departed Erzurum and though the plague was raging at <a href="Tokat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tokat</a>, he was forced to stop there, unable to continue. He wrote his final journal entry on 6 October. It read, in part:</p>

<p>On <a href="16_October" title="wikilink">16 October</a> <a href="1812" class="uri" title="wikilink">1812</a> he died and was given a <a href="Christian_burial" title="wikilink">Christian burial</a> by <a href="Armenian_Apostolic_Church" title="wikilink">Armenian clergy</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
<p>His devotion to his tasks won him much admiration in Great Britain and he was the hero of a number of literary publications.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <a href="Thomas_Babington_Macaulay,_1st_Baron_Macaulay" title="wikilink">Thomas Babington Macaulay</a>'s <em>Epitaph</em>, composed early in 1813, testified to the impression made by his career:</p>

<p>An institution was established in his name in India, called the Henry Martyn Institute: An Interfaith Centre for Reconciliation and Research, Hyderabad, India.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> <a href="John_McManners" title="wikilink">John McManners</a> wrote in his <em>Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity</em> that Martyn was a man remembered for his courage, selflessness and his religious devotion.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In parts of the <a href="Anglican_Communion" title="wikilink">Anglican Communion</a> he is celebrated with a <a href="Lesser_Festival_(Church_of_England)" title="wikilink">Lesser Festival</a> on <a href="19_October" title="wikilink">19 October</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
