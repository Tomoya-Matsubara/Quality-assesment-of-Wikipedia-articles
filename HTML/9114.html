<p>The definition of <strong>Macedonia</strong> is a major source of confusion and debate because of the overlapping use of the term to describe geographical, political and historical areas, languages and peoples. Ethnic groups inhabiting the area use different terminology for the same entity, or the same terminology for different entities, which is often confusing to other inhabitants of the region and foreigners alike.</p>
<p>Macedonia lies in the middle of the Balkans, and Balkan history is complex. <a href="#In_history" title="wikilink">Historically</a>, the region has presented markedly shifting borders across the <a href="Balkans" title="wikilink">Balkan</a> peninsula. <a href="#In_geography" title="wikilink">Geographically</a>, no single definition of its borders or the names of its subdivisions is accepted by all scholars and ethnic groups. <a href="#In_demographics" title="wikilink">Demographically</a>, it is mainly inhabited by four ethnic groups, three of which self-identify as <em>Macedonians</em>: one <a href="South_Slavs" title="wikilink">Slavic</a> group does so at a national level, while a <a href="Bulgarians" title="wikilink">Bulgarian</a> and a <a href="Greeks" title="wikilink">Greek</a> one do so at a regional level. <a href="#In_linguistics" title="wikilink">Linguistically</a>, the names and origins of the languages and dialects spoken in the region are a source of controversy. <a href="#In_politics" title="wikilink">Politically</a>, the use of the name <em>Macedonia</em> has led to a <a href="Macedonia_naming_dispute" title="wikilink">diplomatic dispute</a> between <a href="Greece" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greece</a> and the <a href="Republic_of_Macedonia" title="wikilink">Republic of Macedonia</a>. Despite intervention from the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a>, the dispute is still pending full resolution.</p>
<h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>
<p>There are a number of theories regarding the etymology of the name <strong>Macedonia</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="mythological-personage">Mythological personage</h3>

<p>According to ancient <a href="Greek_mythology" title="wikilink">Greek mythology</a>, <a href="Makednos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Makednos</a> was the name of the first <em>phylarch</em> (tribal chief) or progenitor of the tribe that initially settled western, southern and central Macedonia and founded the kingdom of <a href="Macedon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Macedon</a>.</p>
<h3 id="tall-men">Tall men</h3>
<p>According to <a href="Herodotus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herodotus</a>, the <em>Makedno&lt;U+00ED&gt;</em> were a tribe akin to the <a href="Dorians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dorians</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> one of the principal ancient Greek tribes. The name probably derives from the adjective <strong></strong> <em>makedn&lt;U+00F3&gt;s</em>, meaning &quot;tall&quot;, which <a href="Homer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homer</a> uses for a poplar tree,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and which the grammarian <a href="Hesychius_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">Hesychius of Alexandria</a> records as a <a href="Doric_Greek" title="wikilink">Doric</a> word meaning &quot;large&quot; or &quot;heavenly&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> It has been commonly suggested that both the Macedonians (<em>Maked&lt;U+00F3&gt;nes</em>) and their <em>Makedno&lt;U+00ED&gt;</em> tribal ancestors were regarded as tall people.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="highland-and-highlanders">Highland and highlanders</h3>
<p>According to the <a href="World_Book" title="wikilink">World Book Encyclopedia</a>, the names <em>Macedonia</em> and <em>Macedonians</em> derive from the Greek word <em>Macednon</em> which means <em>high</em> — a reference to the group's mountainous homeland. The <a href="Online_Etymology_Dictionary" title="wikilink">Online Etymology Dictionary</a> summarizes these theories as: </p>
<p>There would appear to be a synonymy among the names of different tribes living in the region: the most likely meanings of <a href="Dorians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dorians</a> and <a href="Bryges" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bryges</a> also are &quot;highlanders.&quot; All the previous names are of <a href="Indo-European_language" title="wikilink">Indo-European</a> origin, the root of <em>makednos</em> being *m&lt;U+0101&gt;k-, &quot;long, thin&quot;, which becomes &quot;long, large&quot; in Greek.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The syllables beyond *m&lt;U+0101&gt;k- are not a compound resulting from the process of production, but are an inherited extension of unknown prehistoric origin; in this case, *-dno-.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Another hypothesis suggests that <em>Maked&lt;U+00F3&gt;nes</em> may derive from an unattested ancient <a href="Ancient_Macedonian_language" title="wikilink">Macedonian</a> <a href="bahuvrihi" class="uri" title="wikilink">bahuvrihi</a> <strong>*</strong> <em>*maki-ked&lt;U+00F3&gt;nes</em> meaning &quot;of the high earth&quot; or &quot;highlanders&quot;,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> which means the same thing but achieves the meaning with a compound rather than an extension.</p>

<p>The <a href="Macedonia_(region)" title="wikilink">region of Macedonia</a> has been home to several historical political entities; the main ones are given below. The borders of each of these entities were different. The area occupied by ancient <a href="Macedon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Macedon</a> approximately coincided with <a href="Macedonia_(Greece)" title="wikilink">contemporary Macedonia in Greece</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>The ancient <a href="Macedon" title="wikilink">kingdom of Macedon</a> had more or less definite borders, although the question of whether the upland areas, like <a href="Lyncestis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lyncestis</a>, were part of the kingdom or independent states tended to be fought out under most of the Macedonian kings. Under <a href="Philip_II_of_Macedon" title="wikilink">Philip II of Macedon</a>, Macedonia expanded markedly, growing to include <a href="Chalcidice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chalcidice</a>, and northward to the <a href="Danube" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danube</a>; Philip personally controlled much of Greece. Under <a href="Alexander_the_Great" title="wikilink">Alexander the Great</a>, Macedon expanded within decades to an <a href="Hellenic_Empire" title="wikilink">Empire</a>, occupying most of the known world; one part of it then became the Hellenistic kingdom of Macedonia. After the Roman conquest following the <a href="Macedonian_Wars" title="wikilink">Macedonian Wars</a>, the Roman Senate established a province of Macedonia, which had various borders in different centuries. The Roman provincial system stopped working at the fall of the Roman Empire, and when the Byzantines set up a <a href="theme_(Byzantine_administrative_unit)" title="wikilink">theme</a> of Macedonia, it was much further to the East, excluding even <a href="Chalcidice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chalcidice</a>, to say nothing of <a href="Thessalonica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thessalonica</a>. The <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a> did not use Macedonia as the name of an administrative unit.</p>
<p>Historical political entities which have used the name <em>Macedonia</em> were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Macedon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Macedon</a>, the ancient <a href="monarchy" title="wikilink">kingdom</a>, existed in the northernmost part of <a href="ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">ancient Greece</a>, bordering the kingdom of <a href="Epirus_(region)" title="wikilink">Epirus</a> on the west and the region of <a href="Thrace" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thrace</a> to the east. The first Macedonian state emerged in the <a href="8th_century_BC" title="wikilink">8th</a> or early 7th century BCE. Its notable ruler <a href="Alexander_the_Great" title="wikilink">Alexander the Great</a> conquered all of the known world to the east of Greece until his early death in 323 BCE. The kingdom lasted until the Romans divided it into four republics in 168 BCE.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Romans had two different entities called <em>Macedonia</em>, at different levels:
<ul>
<li><a href="Macedonia_(Roman_province)" title="wikilink">Macedonia</a> was established as a <a href="Roman_province" title="wikilink">Roman province</a> in <a href="146_BC" title="wikilink">146 BC</a> Its boundaries were shifted from time to time for administrative convenience, but it usually extended west to the Adriatic. <a href="Diocletian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diocletian</a> divided it into <em>Macedonia prima</em> and <em>Macedonia salutaris</em>.</li>
<li><a href="Diocese_of_Macedonia" title="wikilink">Macedonia</a>, was a <a href="Roman_province#List_of_Roman_Provinces_-_300_to_476" title="wikilink">late Roman diocese</a>, organized some time around 300; authorities differ, but it certainly existed under <a href="Constantine_I" title="wikilink">Constantine</a>. In addition to the two Macedonian provinces, it included <a href="Epirus_vetus" title="wikilink">Epirus vetus</a>, <a href="Epirus_nova" title="wikilink">Epirus nova</a>, <a href="Thessaly" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thessaly</a>, <a href="Achaea_(Roman_province)" title="wikilink">Achaea</a>, and <a href="History_of_Crete#Classical,_Hellenistic,_Roman_and_Byzantine_Crete" title="wikilink">Crete</a> - almost all of modern Greece and the present Republic, as well as much of Albania. Both the diocese and the provinces ceased to function as administrative units when the late Roman Empire lost control of the Balkans around 600 or 700.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="Macedonia_(Byzantine_theme)" title="wikilink">Macedonia</a>, during the <a href="Byzantine_Empire" title="wikilink">Byzantine</a> period, was a new <a href="theme_(Byzantine_administrative_unit)" title="wikilink">theme</a> organised by <a href="Empress_Irene" title="wikilink">Empress Irene</a>, out of the <a href="Theme_of_Strymon" title="wikilink">Theme of Strymon</a>, stretching of <a href="Adrianople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adrianople</a> and the <a href="Evros_Prefecture" title="wikilink">Evros</a> valley east along the <a href="Sea_of_Marmara" title="wikilink">Sea of Marmara</a> (ancient Macedon was the <a href="Theme_of_Thessalonica" title="wikilink">Theme of Thessalonica</a>). <a href="John_I_Tzimisces" title="wikilink">John I Tzimisces</a> replaced this with a <a href="ducate_of_Adrianople" title="wikilink">ducate of Adrianople</a>, which included much of his Bulgarian conquests.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="Macedonian_dynasty" title="wikilink">Macedonian dynasty</a> of the Byzantine Empire acquired its name from its founder, <a href="Basil_I" title="wikilink">Basil I</a> the Macedonian; he was born in this theme of Macedonia. His ancestry is disputed; contemporary accounts call him an <a href="Armenians" title="wikilink">Armenian</a> by descent.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Ottomans held Macedonia for five centuries; they did not keep Macedonia as an <a href="Subdivisions_of_the_Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">administrative unit</a>. The region of European Turkey lying between <a href="Thessaly" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thessaly</a> and <a href="Serbia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serbia</a> continued to be called Macedonia, however. In 1904, when most of it was placed under international administration, it contained the districts of <a href="Thessaloniki" title="wikilink">Salonica</a>, <a href="Bitola" title="wikilink">Monastir</a>, <a href="Skopje" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00DC&gt;sk&lt;U+00FC&gt;b</a>, <a href="Kosovo" title="wikilink">Kossovo</a>, <a href="Drama,_Greece" title="wikilink">Drama</a>, and <a href="Serres,_Greece" title="wikilink">Serres</a>. In 1912&lt;U+2013&gt;3, this was divided among the Balkan states.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The ancient Christian sect, the <a href="Macedonians_(religious_group)" title="wikilink">Macedonians</a>, derived their name from their founder, Bishop <a href="Macedonius_I_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">Macedonius I of Constantinople</a>, not from any political or geographical region of Macedonia.</p>
<h3 id="in-modern-history">In modern history</h3>

<p>Since the early stages of the <a href="Greek_Revolution" title="wikilink">Greek Revolution</a>, the provisional government of Greece claimed Macedonia as part of Greek national territory, but the <a href="Treaty_of_Constantinople_(1832)" title="wikilink">Treaty of Constantinople (1832)</a>, which established a Greek independent state, set its northern boundary between <a href="Arta,_Greece" title="wikilink">Arta</a> and <a href="Volos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Volos</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> When the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a> started breaking apart, <em>Macedonia</em> was claimed by all members of the <a href="Balkan_League" title="wikilink">Balkan League</a> (<a href="Serbia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serbia</a>, <a href="Montenegro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montenegro</a>, <a href="Greece" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greece</a> and <a href="Bulgaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a>), and by <a href="Romania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romania</a>. Under the <a href="Treaty_of_San_Stefano" title="wikilink">Treaty of San Stefano</a> that ended the <a href="Russo-Turkish_War,_1877&lt;U+2013&gt;78" title="wikilink">Russo-Turkish War, 1877&lt;U+2013&gt;78</a> the entire region, except Thessaloniki, was included in the borders of <a href="Bulgaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a>, but after the <a href="Congress_of_Berlin" title="wikilink">Congress of Berlin</a> in 1878 the region was returned to the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a>. The armies of the Balkan League advanced and occupied <em>Macedonia</em> in the <a href="First_Balkan_War" title="wikilink">First Balkan War</a> in 1912. Because of disagreements between the allies about the partition of the region, the <a href="Second_Balkan_War" title="wikilink">Second Balkan War</a> erupted, and in its aftermath the arbitrary region of <em>Macedonia</em> was split into definite borders. The political entities that existed or still exist in this region, under the name <em>Macedonia</em> are:</p>

<p><a href="Macedonia_(region)" title="wikilink">Macedonia</a> (as a current geographical term) refers to a region of the <a href="Balkan_peninsula" title="wikilink">Balkan peninsula</a> in <a href="south-eastern_Europe" title="wikilink">south-eastern Europe</a>, covering some 60,000 or 70,000 square kilometers. Although the region's borders are not officially defined by any international organization or state, in some contexts, the territory appears to correspond to the basins of (from west to east) the <a href="Haliacmon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haliacmon</a> (<em>Ali&lt;U+00E1&gt;kmonas</em>), <a href="Vardar" title="wikilink">Vardar / Axios</a> and <a href="Struma_River" title="wikilink">Struma / Strym&lt;U+00F3&gt;nas</a> rivers, and the plains around <a href="Thessaloniki" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thessaloniki</a> and <a href="Serres,_Greece" title="wikilink">Serres</a>.</p>

Enlarge." width="340" /> In a <a href="Historical_regions_of_the_Balkan_Peninsula" title="wikilink">historic context</a>, the region presents markedly shifting borders across the Balkan peninsula, since borders were loosely defined according to the administrative requirements of its conquerors. Under the Ottoman conquest, which lasted five centuries, <em>Macedonia</em> was not an administrative division of the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> H.R. Wilkinson, the geographer, suggests that the region &quot;defies definition&quot;, but that many mappers agree &quot;on its general location&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Macedonia was well enough defined in 1897 for <a href="William_Ewart_Gladstone" title="wikilink">Gladstone</a> to propose &quot;Macedonia for the Macedonians&quot;, implying all the inhabitants of the region, irrespective of their ethnicity.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The Balkan nations began to proclaim their rights to it after the <a href="Treaty_of_San_Stefano" title="wikilink">Treaty of San Stefano</a> in 1878 and its revision at the <a href="Congress_of_Berlin" title="wikilink">Congress of Berlin</a>.</p>
<p>Many <a href="ethnographic" class="uri" title="wikilink">ethnographic</a> maps were produced in this period of controversy; these differ primarily in the areas given to each nationality within Macedonia. This was in part a result of the choice of definition: an inhabitant of Macedonia might well have different nationalities depending on whether the basis of classification was <a href="religious_denomination" title="wikilink">denomination</a>, <a href="kinship_and_descent" title="wikilink">descent</a>, <a href="language" class="uri" title="wikilink">language</a>, <a href="self-identification" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-identification</a> or personal choice. In addition, the Ottoman census, taken on the basis of <a href="religion" class="uri" title="wikilink">religion</a>, was misquoted by all sides; descent, or &quot;<a href="race" class="uri" title="wikilink">race</a>&quot;, was largely conjectural; inhabitants of Macedonia might speak a different language at the market and at home, and the same Slavic dialect might be called Serbian &quot;with Bulgarian influences&quot;, Macedonian, or West-Bulgarian.</p>
<p>These maps would also differ somewhat in the boundaries given to Macedonia. Its only inarguable limits were the <a href="Aegean_Sea" title="wikilink">Aegean Sea</a> and the Serbian and Bulgarian frontiers (as of 1885); where it bordered on Old Serbia, Albania, and Thrace (all parts of Ottoman <a href="Rumelia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rumelia</a>) was debatable.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The Greek ethnographer Nicolaides, the Austrian Meinhard, and the Bulgarian K&lt;U+01CE&gt;n&lt;U+010D&gt;ev accepted the <a href="&lt;U+0160&gt;ar_Mountain" title="wikilink">&lt;U+0160&gt;ar Mountains</a> and the <a href="Skopska_Crna_Gora" title="wikilink">Crna hills</a>; as had scholars before 1878.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The Serb Gop&lt;U+010D&gt;evi&lt;U+010D&gt; preferred a line much further south, assigning the entire region from <a href="Skopje" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skopje</a> to <a href="Strumica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Strumica</a> to &quot;Old Serbia&quot;; and some later Greek geographers have agreed to a more restricted Macedonia.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In addition, maps might vary in smaller details: as to whether this town or that was Macedonian.

<p>In addition to the above named sub-regions, there are also two smaller regions, in <a href="Albania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Albania</a> and <a href="Serbia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serbia</a> respectively.

<p><a href="Mala_Prespa_and_Golo_Bardo" title="wikilink">Mala Prespa and Golo Bardo</a> is a small area in the west of the Macedonia region in <a href="Albania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Albania</a>, mainly around the <a href="Lake_Ohrid" title="wikilink">Lake Ohrid</a>.

<h2 id="in-demographics">In demographics</h2>

<p>The region, as defined above, has a total population of about 5 million. The main disambiguation issue in demographics is the self-identifying name of two contemporary groups. The <a href="ethnic_Macedonian" title="wikilink">ethnic Macedonian</a> population of the <a href="Republic_of_Macedonia" title="wikilink">Republic of Macedonia</a> self-identify as <em>Macedonian</em> on a national level, while the <a href="Greek_Macedonians" title="wikilink">Greek Macedonians</a> self-identify as both <em>Macedonian</em> on a regional, and <em>Greek</em> on a national level. This disambiguation problem has led to a wide variety of terms used to refer to the separate groups, more information of which can be found in the <a href="#Terminology_by_group" title="wikilink">terminology by group</a> section.</p>

<p>The origins of the <a href="Ancient_Macedonian_language" title="wikilink">Ancient Macedonian language</a> are currently debated.

<h2 id="terminology-by-group">Terminology by group</h2>
<p>All these controversies have led ethnic groups in Macedonia to use terms in conflicting ways. Despite the fact that these terms may not always be used in a <a href="pejorative" class="uri" title="wikilink">pejorative</a> way, they may be perceived as such by the receiving ethnic group. Both <a href="Greeks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greeks</a> and <a href="Macedonians_(ethnic_group)" title="wikilink">ethnic Macedonians</a> generally use all terms deriving from <em>Macedonia</em> to describe their own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other side, or the region in general.</p>
<p>A proportion of <a href="Bulgarians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bulgarians</a> and ethnic Macedonians have extremist views about their inter-relatedness. On the one hand, extremist ethnic Macedonians<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> seek to deny the possibility of any national, linguistic and historical relatedness to the Bulgarians. On the other hand, extremist Bulgarians seek to downplay this distinctiveness,<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> and are often supported by extremist Greeks.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Bulgarians and ethnic Macedonians seek to deny the self-identification of the <a href="Minorities_in_Greece#Slavic-speaking" title="wikilink">Slavic speaking minority</a> in northern Greece,<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> which mostly self-identifies as Greek.

<p>Certain terms are in use by these groups as outlined below. Any denial of self-identification by any side, or any attribution of Macedonia related terms by third parties to the other side, can be seen as highly offensive. General usage of these terms follows:</p>

<p><span style="color:#00f;font-variant:small-caps">n-[1]</span>  During the <a href="Greek_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Greek Civil War</a>, in 1947, the <a href="Minister_for_the_Press_and_the_Media_(Greece)" title="wikilink">Greek Ministry of Press and Information</a> published a book, <em>I Enandion tis Ellados Epivoulis</em> (&quot;Designs on Greece&quot;), namely of documents and speeches on the ongoing Macedonian issue, many translations from Yugolsav officials. It reports <a href="Josip_Broz_Tito" title="wikilink">Josip Broz Tito</a> using the term &quot;Aegean Macedonia&quot; on the <a href="October_11" title="wikilink">October 11</a>, <a href="1945" class="uri" title="wikilink">1945</a> in the build up to the Greek Civil War; the original document is archived in &lt;U+2018&gt;GFM A/24581/G2/1945&lt;U+2019&gt;. For Athens, the &lt;U+201C&gt;new term, Aegean Macedonia&lt;U+201D&gt;, (also <em>&lt;U+201C&gt;Pirin Macedonia&lt;U+201D&gt;</em>), was introduced by Yugoslavs. Contextually, this observation indicates this was part of the Yugoslav offensive against Greece, laying claim to Greek Macedonia, but Athens does not take issue with the term itself. The 1945 date concurs with Bulgarian sources. Further information on this can be found in the article <a href="Aegean_Macedonia" title="wikilink">Aegean Macedonia</a>.</p>
<p><span style="color:#00f;font-variant:small-caps">n-[2]</span>  Despite a history of use by Bulgarian nationalists,<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> the term &quot;<em><a href="Pirin_Macedonia" title="wikilink">Pirin Macedonia</a></em>&quot; is today regarded as offensive by certain Bulgarians,<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> who assert that it is widely used by <a href="Macedonism" title="wikilink">Macedonists</a> as part of the <a href="irredentist" class="uri" title="wikilink">irredentist</a> concept of <a href="United_Macedonia" title="wikilink">United Macedonia</a>. However, many people in the country also think of the name as a purely geographical term, which it has historically been. Its use is, thus, controversial.</p>
<p><span style="color:#00f;font-variant:small-caps">n-[3]</span>  The constitutional name of the country &quot;<em>Republic of Macedonia</em>&quot; and the short name &quot;<em>Macedonia</em>&quot; when referring to the country, can be considered offensive by most <a href="Greeks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greeks</a>, especially inhabitants of the Greek province of Macedonia. The official reasons for this, as described by the <a href="Foreign_relations_of_Greece" title="wikilink">Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>, are:</p>

<p><span style="color:#00f;font-variant:small-caps">n-[4]</span> The abbreviated term &quot;<em>FYROM</em>&quot; can be considered offensive when used to refer to the <a href="Republic_of_Macedonia" title="wikilink">Republic of Macedonia</a>. The spellout of the term, the &quot;<em>former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</em>&quot;, is not necessarily considered offensive, but some <a href="Macedonians_(ethnic_group)" title="wikilink">ethnic Macedonians</a> may still find it offensive due to their right of <a href="self-identification" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-identification</a> being ignored. The term can also be offensive for Greeks under certain contexts, since it contains the word <em>Macedonia</em>.</p>
<p><span style="color:#00f;font-variant:small-caps">n-[5]</span>  Although acceptable in the past, current use of the name &quot;<em>Slavomacedonian</em>&quot; in reference to both the ethnic group and the language can be considered <a href="pejorative" class="uri" title="wikilink">pejorative</a> and offensive by <a href="Macedonians_(ethnic_group)" title="wikilink">ethnic Macedonians</a> living in Greece.
