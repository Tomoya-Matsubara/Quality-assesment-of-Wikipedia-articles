<p><strong>Lewis Robert &quot;Hack&quot; Wilson</strong> (April 26, 1900 &lt;U+2013&gt; November 23, 1948) was an American professional <a href="baseball" class="uri" title="wikilink">baseball</a> player who played 12 seasons in <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) for the <a href="San_Francisco_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a>, <a href="Chicago_Cubs" title="wikilink">Chicago Cubs</a>, <a href="Los_Angeles_Dodgers" title="wikilink">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> and <a href="Philadelphia_Phillies" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Phillies</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Despite his diminutive stature, he was one of the most accomplished power hitters in the game during the late 1920s and early 1930s.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> His 1930 season with the Cubs is widely considered one of the most memorable individual single-season hitting performances in baseball history. HIghlights included 56 <a href="home_run" title="wikilink">home runs</a> (the <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> record for 68 years) and 191 <a href="runs_batted_in" title="wikilink">runs batted in</a>, a mark yet to be surpassed. As one sportswriter of the day remarked, &quot;For a brief span of a few years, this hammered down little strongman actually rivaled the mighty [Babe] Ruth.&quot;</p>
<p>While Wilson's combativeness and excessive alcohol consumption made him one of the most colorful sports personalities of his era,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> his drinking and fighting undoubtedly contributed to a premature end to his athletic career and, ultimately, his premature demise.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He was inducted into the <a href="Baseball_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in <a href="Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_balloting,_1979" title="wikilink">1979</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Lewis Robert Wilson was born April 26, 1900 in the <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a> steel mill town of <a href="Ellwood_City" title="wikilink">Ellwood City</a>, north of <a href="Pittsburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> His mother, Jennie Kaughn, 16, was an unemployed drifter from <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>; his father, Robert Wilson, 24, was a steel worker. His parents never married; both were heavy drinkers, and in 1907 his mother died of <a href="appendicitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">appendicitis</a> at the age of 24.</p>
<p>In 1916 Lewis left school to take a job at a locomotive factory, swinging a sledge hammer for four dollars a week.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Although only five feet six inches tall, he weighed 195 pounds with an 18-inch neck, and feet that fit into size-five-and-one-half shoes. One sportswriter later observed that he was &quot;built along the lines of a beer keg, and was not wholly unfamiliar with its contents.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> While his unusual physique was considered an oddity at the time,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> his large head, tiny feet, short legs and broad, flat face are now recognized as hallmarks of the <a href="Fetal_Alcohol_Syndrome" title="wikilink">Fetal Alcohol Syndrome</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="1921_Major_League_Baseball_season" title="wikilink">1921</a> Wilson moved to <a href="Martinsburg,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Martinsburg, West Virginia</a> to join the Martinsburg Mountaineers of the Class &quot;D&quot; <a href="Blue_Ridge_League" title="wikilink">Blue Ridge League</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> After breaking his leg while sliding into <a href="home_plate" title="wikilink">home plate</a> during his first professional game,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> he was moved from the catcher's position to the outfield.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In <a href="1923_Major_League_Baseball_season" title="wikilink">1923</a>, playing for the &quot;B&quot; division <a href="Portsmouth_Truckers" title="wikilink">Portsmouth Truckers</a>, he led the <a href="Virginia_League" title="wikilink">Virginia League</a> in hitting with a .388 <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">batting average</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Late in the season, <a href="San_Francisco_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a> manager <a href="John_McGraw" title="wikilink">John McGraw</a> purchased his contract from Portsmouth for $10,500.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>Wilson made his major league debut with the Giants on September 29, 1923, and became the starting <a href="left_fielder" title="wikilink">left fielder</a> the following season after <a href="Billy_Southworth" title="wikilink">Billy Southworth</a> fell into a hitting slump.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Multiple stories exist to explain the origin of his nickname: By one account, a New York newspaper held a nicknaming contest; the winning entry was &quot;Hack&quot; because Wilson reminded many fans of another stocky athlete, the popular wrestler <a href="Georg_Hackenschmidt" title="wikilink">Georg Hackenschmidt</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In another version, McGraw is said to have remarked that Wilson's physique was reminiscent of a &quot;hack&quot; (slang for <a href="taxicab" class="uri" title="wikilink">taxicab</a> in that era). Giants teammate <a href="Bill_Cunningham_(outfielder)" title="wikilink">Bill Cunningham</a> claimed that the nickname was based on Wilson's resemblance to <a href="Hack_Miller_(catcher)" title="wikilink">Hack Miller</a>, a catcher with the Chicago Cubs. The <em><a href="New_York_Times" title="wikilink">New York Times</a></em> printed the first documented usage of &quot;Hack&quot; on June 10, 1924.</p>
<p>By mid-July Wilson was ranked second in the <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> (NL) in hitting.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> He ended the season with a .295 average along with 10 <a href="home_run" title="wikilink">home runs</a> and 57 <a href="runs_batted_in" title="wikilink">runs batted in</a> (RBIs) as the Giants clinched the NL <a href="Pennant_(sports)" title="wikilink">pennant</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In the <a href="1924_World_Series" title="wikilink">1924 World Series</a> he averaged only .233 as the Giants lost to the <a href="1924_Washington_Senators_season" title="wikilink">Washington Senators</a> in seven games.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Early in the <a href="1925_New_York_Giants_(MLB)_season" title="wikilink">1925</a> season Wilson hit the longest home run on record at <a href="Ebbets_Field" title="wikilink">Ebbets Field</a> against the <a href="1925_Brooklyn_Robins_season" title="wikilink">Brooklyn Robins</a>,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> but fell into a slump in May, and was replaced in left field by <a href="Irish_Meusel" title="wikilink">Irish Meusel</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> On July 2 he hit two home runs in one <a href="inning" class="uri" title="wikilink">inning</a>, tying <a href="Ken_Williams_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Ken Williams</a>'s major league record set in <a href="1922_Major_League_Baseball_season" title="wikilink">1922</a>,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> but his hitting slump continued. In August McGraw told reporters that he had &quot;...made the mistake of rushing [Wilson] along,&quot; and sent him to the Giants' minor league affiliate, the <a href="Toledo_Mud_Hens" title="wikilink">Toledo Mud Hens</a> of the <a href="American_Association_(20th_century)" title="wikilink">American Association</a>. At season's end a front office oversight left him unprotected on the Toledo roster, and the last-place Chicago Cubs acquired him on <a href="Major_League_Baseball_transactions#Waivers" title="wikilink">waivers</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> &quot;They let go the best outfielder I ever played alongside,&quot; said Giants right fielder <a href="Ross_Youngs" title="wikilink">Ross Youngs</a>, &quot;and they're going to regret it.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="glory-years-with-the-cubs">Glory years with the Cubs</h3>
<p>Wilson regained his form as the Cubs' <a href="center_fielder" title="wikilink">center fielder</a> in <a href="1926_Chicago_Cubs_season" title="wikilink">1926</a> and soon became a favorite of Chicago fans.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> On May 24 he hit the center field scoreboard with one of the longest home runs in <a href="Wrigley_Field" title="wikilink">Wrigley Field</a> history as the Cubs came from behind to defeat the <a href="1926_Boston_Braves_season" title="wikilink">Boston Braves</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Later that evening he made news again when he was arrested during a police raid of a <a href="Prohibition" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prohibition</a>-era <a href="speakeasy" class="uri" title="wikilink">speakeasy</a> while trying to escape through the rear window.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He ended the season with a league-leading 21 home runs along with 36 <a href="double_(baseball)" title="wikilink">doubles</a>, 109 RBIs, a .321 batting average, and a .406 <a href="on-base_percentage" title="wikilink">on-base percentage</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The Cubs improved to fourth place, and Wilson ended the year ranked fifth in voting for the NL's <a href="Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" title="wikilink">Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Another strong performance followed in <a href="1927_Chicago_Cubs_season" title="wikilink">1927</a> as Wilson once again led the league in home runs. Although the Cubs were in first place heading into the final month of the season, the team faltered and again finished fourth.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Wilson posted a .318 average with 30 home runs and 129 RBIs,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> and led NL outfielders with 400 <a href="putouts" class="uri" title="wikilink">putouts</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> He led the NL in home runs for a third consecutive year in <a href="1928_Chicago_Cubs_season" title="wikilink">1928</a> with 31, along with 120 RBIs and a .313 average as the Cubs improved to third place.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Wilson had a combative streak and frequently initiated fights with opposing players and fans. On June 22, 1928 a near-riot broke out in the ninth inning at Wrigley Field against the <a href="St._Louis_Cardinals" title="wikilink">St. Louis Cardinals</a> when Wilson jumped into the box seats to attack a heckling fan.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> An estimated 5,000 spectators swarmed the field before police could separate the combatants and restore order.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The fan sued Wilson for $20,000, but a jury ruled in his favor.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The following year he took offense at a remark by <a href="Cincinnati_Reds" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Reds</a> <a href="pitcher" class="uri" title="wikilink">pitcher</a> <a href="Ray_Kolp" title="wikilink">Ray Kolp</a>, and upon reaching <a href="first_base" title="wikilink">first base</a> after hitting a <a href="single_(baseball)" title="wikilink">single</a> he charged into the Reds dugout, punching Kolp several times before they could be separated.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Later that evening at the train station, Wilson exchanged words and blows with Cincinnati player <a href="Pete_Donohue" title="wikilink">Pete Donohue</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> In late 1929 he signed a contract to fight <a href="Art_Shires" title="wikilink">Art Shires</a> of the <a href="Chicago_White_Sox" title="wikilink">Chicago White Sox</a> in a boxing match,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> but reneged after Shires lost a fight to <a href="George_Trafton" title="wikilink">George Trafton</a> of the <a href="Chicago_Bears" title="wikilink">Chicago Bears</a> in December.

<p>In <a href="1929_Chicago_Cubs_season" title="wikilink">1929</a>, Wilson hit .345 with 39 home runs and a league-record 159 RBIs.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> He and new teammate <a href="Rogers_Hornsby" title="wikilink">Rogers Hornsby</a> (who also contributed 39 home runs) led the Cubs to their first NL pennant in eleven years.

Though trailing the Series two games to one, the Cubs were leading by a score of 8&lt;U+2013&gt;0 in the fourth game when the Athletics mounted a 10-<a href="Run_(baseball)" title="wikilink">run</a> rally in the seventh inning. Wilson lost two fly balls in the sun; the second, with two runners on base, led to an <a href="inside-the-park_home_run" title="wikilink">inside-the-park home run</a> by <a href="Mule_Haas" title="wikilink">Mule Haas</a> as the Athletics won 10&lt;U+2013&gt;8.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> After the game, Cubs manager <a href="Joe_McCarthy_(manager)" title="wikilink">Joe McCarthy</a> reportedly told a boy asking for a souvenir baseball, &quot;Come back tomorrow and stand behind Wilson, and you'll be able to pick up all the balls you want!&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The Athletics won again the next day to take the Series in five games.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

NL President <a href="Ford_Frick" title="wikilink">Ford Frick</a> finally sent money to cover his funeral expenses.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> In marked contrast to <a href="Babe_Ruth" title="wikilink">Babe Ruth</a>'s funeral, which had been attended by thousands just three months earlier, only a few hundred people were present for Wilson's services.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> He was buried in Rosedale Cemetery in the town where he made his professional playing debut, Martinsburg, West Virginia.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Ten months later Joe McCarthy organized a second, more complete memorial service, attended by <a href="Kiki_Cuyler" title="wikilink">Kiki Cuyler</a>, Charlie Grimm, <a href="Nick_Altrock" title="wikilink">Nick Altrock</a> and other players from the Cubs and the Martinsburg team (by then renamed the Blue Sox). A granite tombstone was unveiled, with the inscription, &quot;One of Baseball's Immortals, Lewis R. (Hack) Wilson, Rests Here.&quot;</p>
<p>One week before his death, Wilson gave an interview to CBS Radio which was reprinted in Chicago newspapers. In 1949 Charlie Grimm, the Cubs' new manager, posted a framed excerpt from that interview in the Cubs clubhouse, where it remains. It reads, in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Talent isn't enough. You need common sense and good advice. If anyone tries to tell you different, tell them the story of Hack Wilson. ... Kids in and out of baseball who think because they have talent they have the world by the tail. It isn't so. Kids, don't be too big to accept advice. Don't let what happened to me happen to you.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1979 Wilson was inducted into the <a href="National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum" title="wikilink">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> by the <a href="Veterans_Committee" title="wikilink">Veterans Committee</a>.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> A Martinsburg street is named Hack Wilson Way in his honor,<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> and the access road to a large city park within his home town, Ellwood City, Pennsylvania, is known as Hack Wilson Drive.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
