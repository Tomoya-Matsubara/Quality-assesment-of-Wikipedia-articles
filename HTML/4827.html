<p><strong>Vacuum</strong> is <a href="space" class="uri" title="wikilink">space</a> that is devoid of <a href="matter" class="uri" title="wikilink">matter</a>. The word stems from the Latin adjective <em>vacuus</em> for &quot;vacant&quot; or &quot;void&quot;. An approximation to such vacuum is a region with a gaseous <a href="pressure" class="uri" title="wikilink">pressure</a> much less than <a href="atmospheric_pressure" title="wikilink">atmospheric pressure</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a <em>perfect</em> vacuum, which they sometimes simply call &quot;vacuum&quot; or <strong>free space</strong>, and use the term <strong>partial vacuum</strong> to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum as one might have in a <a href="laboratory" class="uri" title="wikilink">laboratory</a> or in <a href="outer_space" title="wikilink">space</a>. The Latin term <strong><em>in vacuo</em></strong> is used to describe an object as being in what would otherwise be a vacuum.</p>
<p>The <em>quality</em> of a partial vacuum refers to how closely it approaches a perfect vacuum. Other things equal, lower gas <a href="pressure" class="uri" title="wikilink">pressure</a> means higher-quality vacuum. For example, a typical <a href="vacuum_cleaner" title="wikilink">vacuum cleaner</a> produces enough <a href="suction" class="uri" title="wikilink">suction</a> to reduce air pressure by around 20%.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Much higher-quality vacuums are possible. <a href="Ultra-high_vacuum" title="wikilink">Ultra-high vacuum</a> chambers, common in chemistry, physics, and engineering, operate below one trillionth (10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;12</sup>) of atmospheric pressure (100 nPa), and can reach around 100 particles/cm<sup>3</sup>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="Outer_space" title="wikilink">Outer space</a> is an even higher-quality vacuum, with the equivalent of just a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter on average.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> According to modern understanding, even if all matter could be removed from a volume, it would still not be &quot;empty&quot; due to <a href="vacuum_fluctuations" title="wikilink">vacuum fluctuations</a>, <a href="dark_energy" title="wikilink">dark energy</a>, transiting gamma- and cosmic rays, neutrinos, along with other phenomena in <a href="quantum_physics" title="wikilink">quantum physics</a>. In modern particle physics, the <a href="vacuum_state" title="wikilink">vacuum state</a> is considered as the <a href="ground_state" title="wikilink">ground state</a> of matter.</p>
<p>Vacuum has been a frequent topic of <a href="philosophical" class="uri" title="wikilink">philosophical</a> debate since ancient <a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">Greek</a> times, but was not studied empirically until the 17th century. <a href="Evangelista_Torricelli" title="wikilink">Evangelista Torricelli</a> produced the first laboratory vacuum in 1643, and other experimental techniques were developed as a result of his theories of <a href="atmospheric_pressure" title="wikilink">atmospheric pressure</a>. A <strong>torricellian vacuum</strong> is created by filling with mercury a tall glass container closed at one end and then inverting the container into a bowl to contain the mercury.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Vacuum became a valuable industrial tool in the 20th century with the introduction of <a href="incandescent_light_bulb" title="wikilink">incandescent light bulbs</a> and <a href="vacuum_tube" title="wikilink">vacuum tubes</a>, and a wide array of vacuum technology has since become available. The recent development of <a href="human_spaceflight" title="wikilink">human spaceflight</a> has raised interest in the impact of vacuum on human health, and on life forms in general. <img src="Apollo_Command_Service_Module_in_vacuum_chamber.jpg" title="fig:A large vacuum chamber" alt="A large vacuum chamber" width="300" /></p>
<h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>
<p>From <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> <strong>vacuum</strong> (<em>an empty space, void</em>) noun use of neuter of <em>vacuus</em> (<em>empty</em>) related to <em>vacare</em> (<em>be empty</em>).</p>

<p>In <a href="classical_electromagnetism" title="wikilink">classical electromagnetism</a>, the <strong>vacuum of free space</strong>, or sometimes just <em>free space</em> or <em>perfect vacuum</em>, is a standard reference medium for electromagnetic effects.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Some authors refer to this reference medium as <em>classical vacuum</em>,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> a terminology intended to separate this concept from <a href="QED_vacuum" title="wikilink">QED vacuum</a> or <a href="QCD_vacuum" title="wikilink">QCD vacuum</a>, where <a href="vacuum_fluctuations" title="wikilink">vacuum fluctuations</a> can produce transient <a href="virtual_particle" title="wikilink">virtual particle</a> densities and a <a href="relative_permittivity" title="wikilink">relative permittivity</a> and <a href="relative_permeability" title="wikilink">relative permeability</a> that are not identically unity.<ref name=Grynberg> </p>

<p>In <a href="quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum mechanics</a> and <a href="quantum_field_theory" title="wikilink">quantum field theory</a>, the vacuum is defined as the state (that is, the solution to the equations of the theory) with the lowest possible energy (the <a href="ground_state" title="wikilink">ground state</a> of the <a href="Hilbert_space" title="wikilink">Hilbert space</a>). In <a href="quantum_electrodynamics" title="wikilink">quantum electrodynamics</a> this vacuum is referred to as '<a href="QED_vacuum" title="wikilink">QED vacuum</a>' to separate it from the vacuum of <a href="quantum_chromodynamics" title="wikilink">quantum chromodynamics</a>, denoted as <a href="QCD_vacuum" title="wikilink">QCD vacuum</a>. QED vacuum is a state with no matter particles (hence the name), and also no <a href="photon" title="wikilink">photons</a>, no <a href="graviton" title="wikilink">gravitons</a>, etc. As described above, this state is impossible to achieve experimentally. (Even if every matter particle could somehow be removed from a volume, it would be impossible to eliminate all the <a href="black_body_radiation" title="wikilink">blackbody photons</a>.) Nonetheless, it provides a good model for realizable vacuum, and agrees with a number of experimental observations as described next.</p>
<p>QED vacuum has interesting and complex properties. In QED vacuum, the electric and magnetic fields have zero average values, but their variances are not zero.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> As a result, QED vacuum contains <a href="vacuum_fluctuations" title="wikilink">vacuum fluctuations</a> (<a href="virtual_particles" title="wikilink">virtual particles</a> that hop into and out of existence), and a finite energy called <a href="vacuum_energy" title="wikilink">vacuum energy</a>. Vacuum fluctuations are an essential and ubiquitous part of quantum field theory. Some experimentally verified effects of vacuum fluctuations include <a href="spontaneous_emission" title="wikilink">spontaneous emission</a> and the <a href="Lamb_shift" title="wikilink">Lamb shift</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The <a href="Casimir_effect" title="wikilink">Casimir effect</a> is often also described as caused by vacuum fluctuations, this is false it is a van der Waals force <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>. <a href="Coulomb&#39;s_law" title="wikilink">Coulomb's law</a> and the <a href="electric_potential" title="wikilink">electric potential</a> in vacuum near an electric charge are modified.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Theoretically, in QCD vacuum multiple vacuum states can coexist.<ref name=Altarelli> </p>
<p></ref> The starting and ending of <a href="Inflation_(cosmology)" title="wikilink">cosmological inflation</a> is thought to have arisen from transitions between different vacuum states. For theories obtained by quantization of a classical theory, each <a href="stationary_point" title="wikilink">stationary point</a> of the energy in the <a href="configuration_space" title="wikilink">configuration space</a> gives rise to a single vacuum. <a href="String_theory" title="wikilink">String theory</a> is believed to have a huge number of vacua &lt;U+2014&gt; the so-called <a href="string_theory_landscape" title="wikilink">string theory landscape</a>.</p>

<p><a href="Outer_space" title="wikilink">Outer space</a> has very low density and pressure, and is the closest physical approximation of a perfect vacuum. But no vacuum is truly perfect, not even in interstellar space, where there are still a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Stars, planets and moons keep their <a href="atmosphere" title="wikilink">atmospheres</a> by gravitational attraction, and as such, atmospheres have no clearly delineated boundary: the density of atmospheric gas simply decreases with distance from the object. The Earth's atmospheric pressure drops to about  at  of altitude,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> the <a href="K&lt;U+00E1&gt;rm&lt;U+00E1&gt;n_line" title="wikilink">K&lt;U+00E1&gt;rm&lt;U+00E1&gt;n line</a>, which is a common definition of the boundary with outer space. Beyond this line, isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to <a href="radiation_pressure" title="wikilink">radiation pressure</a> from the <a href="sun" class="uri" title="wikilink">sun</a> and the <a href="dynamic_pressure" title="wikilink">dynamic pressure</a> of the <a href="solar_wind" title="wikilink">solar wind</a>, so the definition of pressure becomes difficult to interpret. The <a href="thermosphere" class="uri" title="wikilink">thermosphere</a> in this range has large gradients of pressure, temperature and composition, and varies greatly due to <a href="space_weather" title="wikilink">space weather</a>. Astrophysicists prefer to use <a href="number_density" title="wikilink">number density</a> to describe these environments, in units of particles per cubic centimetre.</p>
<p>But although it meets the definition of outer space, the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the K&lt;U+00E1&gt;rm&lt;U+00E1&gt;n line is still sufficient to produce significant <a href="Drag_(physics)" title="wikilink">drag</a> on <a href="satellite" title="wikilink">satellites</a>. Most artificial satellites operate in this region called <a href="low_earth_orbit" title="wikilink">low earth orbit</a> and must fire their engines every few days to maintain orbit. The drag here is low enough that it could theoretically be overcome by radiation pressure on <a href="solar_sail" title="wikilink">solar sails</a>, a proposed propulsion system for <a href="interplanetary_travel" title="wikilink">interplanetary travel</a>. Planets are too massive for their trajectories to be significantly affected by these forces, although their atmospheres are eroded by the solar winds.</p>
<p>All of the observable <a href="universe" class="uri" title="wikilink">universe</a> is filled with large numbers of <a href="photon" title="wikilink">photons</a>, the so-called <a href="cosmic_background_radiation" title="wikilink">cosmic background radiation</a>, and quite likely a correspondingly large number of <a href="neutrino" title="wikilink">neutrinos</a>. The current <a href="temperature" class="uri" title="wikilink">temperature</a> of this radiation is about 3 <a href="Kelvin" title="wikilink">K</a>, or -270 degrees Celsius or -454 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<h2 id="historical-interpretation">Historical interpretation</h2>
<p>Historically, there has been much dispute over whether such a thing as a vacuum can exist. Ancient <a href="Greek_philosophy" title="wikilink">Greek philosophers</a> debated the existence of a vacuum, or void, in the context of <a href="atomism" class="uri" title="wikilink">atomism</a>, which posited void and atom as the fundamental explanatory elements of physics. Following <a href="Plato" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plato</a>, even the abstract concept of a featureless void faced considerable skepticism: it could not be apprehended by the senses, it could not, itself, provide additional explanatory power beyond the physical volume with which it was commensurate and, by definition, it was quite literally nothing at all, which cannot rightly be said to exist. <a href="Aristotle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a> believed that no void could occur naturally, because the denser surrounding material continuum would immediately fill any incipient rarity that might give rise to a void.</p>
<p>In his <em><a href="Physics_(Aristotle)" title="wikilink">Physics</a></em>, book IV, Aristotle offered numerous arguments against the void: for example, that motion through a medium which offered no impediment could continue <em>ad infinitum</em>, there being no reason that something would come to rest anywhere in particular. Although <a href="Lucretius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lucretius</a> argued for the existence of vacuum in the first century BC and <a href="Hero_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">Hero of Alexandria</a> tried unsuccessfully to create an artificial vacuum in the first century AD,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> it was European <a href="scholasticism" title="wikilink">scholars</a> such as <a href="Roger_Bacon" title="wikilink">Roger Bacon</a>, <a href="Blasius_of_Parma" title="wikilink">Blasius of Parma</a> and <a href="Walter_Burley" title="wikilink">Walter Burley</a> in the 13th and 14th century who focused considerable attention on these issues. Eventually following <a href="Stoic_physics" title="wikilink">Stoic physics</a> in this instance, scholars from the 14th century onward increasingly departed from the Aristotelian perspective in favor of a <a href="supernatural" class="uri" title="wikilink">supernatural</a> void beyond the confines of the cosmos itself, a conclusion widely acknowledged by the 17th century, which helped to segregate natural and theological concerns.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Almost two thousand years after Plato, <a href="Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Descartes" title="wikilink">Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Descartes</a> also proposed a geometrically based alternative theory of atomism, without the problematic nothing&lt;U+2013&gt;everything <a href="dichotomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">dichotomy</a> of void and atom. Although Descartes agreed with the contemporary position, that a vacuum does not occur in nature, the success of his <a href="Cartesian_coordinate_system" title="wikilink">namesake coordinate system</a> and more implicitly, the spacial&lt;U+2013&gt;corporeal component of his metaphysics would come to define the philosophically modern notion of empty space as a quantified extension of volume. By the ancient definition however, directional information and magnitude were conceptually distinct. With the acquiescence of Cartesian <a href="mechanical_philosophy" title="wikilink">mechanical philosophy</a> to the &quot;brute fact&quot; of <a href="action_at_a_distance" title="wikilink">action at a distance</a>, and at length, its successful reification by force fields and ever more sophisticated geometric structure, the anachronism of empty space widened until &quot;a seething ferment&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> of quantum activity in the 20th century filled the vacuum with a virtual <a href="pleroma" class="uri" title="wikilink">pleroma</a>.</p>
<p>The explanation of a <em>clepsydra</em> or <a href="water_clock" title="wikilink">water clock</a> was a popular topic in the Middle Ages. Although a simple wine skin sufficed to demonstrate a partial vacuum, in principle, more advanced suction pumps had been developed in Roman Pompeii.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>In the medieval Middle Eastern world, the physicist and Islamic scholar, <a href="Al-Farabi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Al-Farabi</a> (Alpharabius, 872-950), conducted a small <a href="experiment" class="uri" title="wikilink">experiment</a> concerning the existence of vacuum, in which he investigated handheld plungers in water.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> He concluded that air's volume can expand to fill available space, and he suggested that the concept of perfect vacuum was incoherent.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> However, according to Nader El-Bizri, the physicist <a href="Ibn_al-Haytham" title="wikilink">Ibn al-Haytham</a> (Alhazen, 965-1039) and the <a href="Mu&#39;tazili" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mu'tazili</a> <a href="Kalam" title="wikilink">theologians</a> disagreed with Aristotle and Al-Farabi, and they supported the existence of a void. Using <a href="geometry" class="uri" title="wikilink">geometry</a>, Ibn al-Haytham <a href="Islamic_mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematically</a> demonstrated that place (<em>al-makan</em>) is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> According to Ahmad Dallal, <a href="Ab&lt;U+016B&gt;_Rayh&lt;U+0101&gt;n_al-B&lt;U+012B&gt;r&lt;U+016B&gt;n&lt;U+012B&gt;" title="wikilink">Ab&lt;U+016B&gt; Rayh&lt;U+0101&gt;n al-B&lt;U+012B&gt;r&lt;U+016B&gt;n&lt;U+012B&gt;</a> also states that &quot;there is no observable evidence that rules out the possibility of vacuum&quot;.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The suction pump later appeared in Europe from the 15th century.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>While outer space provides the most rarefied example of a naturally occurring partial vacuum, the heavens were originally thought to be seamlessly filled by a rigid indestructible material called <a href="aether_(classical_element)" title="wikilink">aether</a>. Borrowing somewhat from the <a href="pneuma" class="uri" title="wikilink">pneuma</a> of <a href="Stoic_physics" title="wikilink">Stoic physics</a>, aether came to be regarded as the rarefied air from which it took its name, (see <a href="Aether_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Aether (mythology)</a>). Early theories of <a href="light" class="uri" title="wikilink">light</a> posited a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light propagated. Additionally, the concept informed <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Isaac Newton</a> explanations of both <a href="refraction" class="uri" title="wikilink">refraction</a> and of radiant heat.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> 19th century experiments into this <a href="luminiferous_aether" title="wikilink">luminiferous aether</a> attempted to detect a minute drag on the Earth's orbit. While the Earth does, in fact, move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space, the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected. In 1912, <a href="astronomer" class="uri" title="wikilink">astronomer</a> <a href="William_Henry_Pickering" title="wikilink">Henry Pickering</a> commented: &quot;While the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether, [it] is characteristic of a gas, and free gaseous molecules are certainly there&quot;.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1930, <a href="Paul_Dirac" title="wikilink">Paul Dirac</a> proposed a model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles possessing negative energy, called the <a href="Dirac_sea" title="wikilink">Dirac sea</a>. This theory helped refine the predictions of his earlier formulated <a href="Dirac_equation" title="wikilink">Dirac equation</a>, and successfully predicted the existence of the <a href="positron" class="uri" title="wikilink">positron</a>, confirmed two years later. <a href="Werner_Heisenberg" title="wikilink">Werner Heisenberg</a>'s <a href="uncertainty_principle" title="wikilink">uncertainty principle</a> formulated in 1927, predict a fundamental limit within which instantaneous position and <a href="momentum" class="uri" title="wikilink">momentum</a>, or energy and time can be measured. This has far reaching consequences on the &quot;emptiness&quot; of space between particles. In the late 20th century, so-called <a href="virtual_particle" title="wikilink">virtual particles</a> that arise spontaneously from empty space were confirmed.</p>
<h2 id="measurement">Measurement</h2>

<p>The quality of a vacuum is indicated by the amount of matter remaining in the system, so that a high quality vacuum is one with very little matter left in it. Vacuum is primarily measured by its <a href="absolute_pressure" title="wikilink">absolute pressure</a>, but a complete characterization requires further parameters, such as <a href="temperature" class="uri" title="wikilink">temperature</a> and chemical composition. One of the most important parameters is the <strong><a href="mean_free_path" title="wikilink">mean free path</a></strong> (MFP) of residual gases, which indicates the average distance that molecules will travel between collisions with each other. As the gas density decreases, the MFP increases, and when the MFP is longer than the chamber, pump, spacecraft, or other objects present, the continuum assumptions of <a href="fluid_mechanics" title="wikilink">fluid mechanics</a> do not apply. This vacuum state is called <em>high vacuum</em>, and the study of fluid flows in this regime is called particle gas dynamics. The MFP of air at atmospheric pressure is very short, 70 <a href="nanometer" title="wikilink">nm</a>, but at 100 <a href="millipascal" title="wikilink">mPa</a> (~1&lt;U+00D7&gt;10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;3</sup> <a href="Torr" class="uri" title="wikilink">Torr</a>) the MFP of room temperature air is roughly 100 mm, which is on the order of everyday objects such as <a href="vacuum_tube" title="wikilink">vacuum tubes</a>. The <a href="Crookes_radiometer" title="wikilink">Crookes radiometer</a> turns when the MFP is larger than the size of the vanes.</p>
<p>Vacuum quality is subdivided into ranges according to the technology required to achieve it or measure it. These ranges do not have universally agreed definitions, but a typical distribution is as follows:<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<li><strong>Atmospheric pressure</strong> is variable but standardized at 101.325 kPa (760 Torr)</li>
<li><strong>Low vacuum</strong>, also called <em>rough vacuum</em> or <em>coarse vacuum</em>, is vacuum that can be achieved or measured with rudimentary equipment such as a <a href="vacuum_cleaner" title="wikilink">vacuum cleaner</a> and a liquid column <a href="Pressure_measurement" title="wikilink">manometer</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Medium vacuum</strong> is vacuum that can be achieved with a single pump, but the pressure is too low to measure with a liquid or mechanical manometer. It can be measured with a McLeod gauge, thermal gauge or a capacitive gauge.</li>
<li><strong>High vacuum</strong> is vacuum where the <a href="mean_free_path" title="wikilink">MFP</a> of residual gases is longer than the size of the chamber or of the object under test. High vacuum usually requires multi-stage pumping and ion gauge measurement. Some texts differentiate between high vacuum and <em>very high vacuum.</em></li>
<li><strong>Ultra high vacuum</strong> requires baking the chamber to remove trace gases, and other special procedures. British and German standards define ultra high vacuum as pressures below 10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;6</sup> Pa (10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;8</sup> Torr).<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>Deep space</strong> is generally much more empty than any artificial vacuum. It may or may not meet the definition of high vacuum above, depending on what region of space and astronomical bodies are being considered. For example, the MFP of interplanetary space is smaller than the size of the solar system, but larger than small planets and moons. As a result, solar winds exhibit continuum flow on the scale of the solar system, but must be considered as a bombardment of particles with respect to the Earth and Moon.</li>
<li><strong>Perfect vacuum</strong> is an ideal state of no particles at all. It cannot be achieved in a <a href="laboratory" class="uri" title="wikilink">laboratory</a>, although there may be small volumes which, for a brief moment, happen to have no particles of matter in them. Even if all particles of matter were removed, there would still be <a href="photon" title="wikilink">photons</a> and <a href="graviton" title="wikilink">gravitons</a>, as well as <a href="dark_energy" title="wikilink">dark energy</a>, <a href="virtual_particle" title="wikilink">virtual particles</a>, and other aspects of the <a href="quantum_vacuum" title="wikilink">quantum vacuum</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Hard vacuum</strong> and <strong>Soft vacuum</strong> are terms that are defined with a dividing line defined differently by different sources, such as 1 <a href="Torr" class="uri" title="wikilink">Torr</a>,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> or 0.1 Torr,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> the common denominator being that a hard vacuum is a higher vacuum than a soft one.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="relative-versus-absolute-measurement">Relative versus absolute measurement</h3>
<p>Vacuum is measured in units of <a href="pressure" class="uri" title="wikilink">pressure</a>, typically as a subtraction relative to ambient atmospheric pressure on Earth. But the amount of relative measurable vacuum varies with local conditions. On the surface of <a href="Jupiter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jupiter</a>, where ground level atmospheric pressure is much higher than on Earth, much higher relative vacuum readings would be possible. On the surface of the moon with almost no atmosphere, it would be extremely difficult to create a measurable vacuum relative to the local environment.</p>
<p>Similarly, much higher than normal relative vacuum readings are possible deep in the Earth's ocean. A <a href="submarine" class="uri" title="wikilink">submarine</a> maintaining an internal pressure of 1 atmosphere submerged to a depth of 10 atmospheres (98 metres; a 9.8 metre column of seawater has the equivalent weight of 1 atm) is effectively a vacuum chamber keeping out the crushing exterior water pressures, though the 1 atm inside the submarine would not normally be considered a vacuum.</p>
<p>Therefore to properly understand the following discussions of vacuum measurement, it is important that the reader assumes the relative measurements are being done on Earth at sea level, at exactly 1 atmosphere of ambient atmospheric pressure.</p>

<p><img src="McLeod_gauge_01.jpg" title="fig:A glass McLeod gauge, drained of mercury" alt="A glass McLeod gauge, drained of mercury" /> The <a href="SI" class="uri" title="wikilink">SI</a> unit of pressure is the <a href="pascal_(unit)" title="wikilink">pascal</a> (symbol Pa), but vacuum is often measured in <a href="torr" title="wikilink">torrs</a>, named for Torricelli, an early Italian physicist (1608&lt;U+2013&gt;1647). A torr is equal to the displacement of a millimeter of mercury (<a href="mmHg" class="uri" title="wikilink">mmHg</a>) in a <a href="manometer" class="uri" title="wikilink">manometer</a> with 1 torr equaling 133.3223684 pascals above absolute zero pressure. Vacuum is often also measured on the <a href="barometer" title="wikilink">barometric</a> scale or as a percentage of <a href="atmospheric_pressure" title="wikilink">atmospheric pressure</a> in <a href="bar_(unit)" title="wikilink">bars</a> or <a href="atmosphere_(unit)" title="wikilink">atmospheres</a>. Low vacuum is often measured in <a href="millimeters_of_mercury" title="wikilink">millimeters of mercury</a> (mmHg) or pascals (Pa) below standard atmospheric pressure. &quot;Below atmospheric&quot; means that the absolute pressure is equal to the current atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>In other words, most low vacuum gauges that read, for example 50.79 Torr. Many inexpensive low vacuum gauges have a margin of error and may report a vacuum of 0 Torr but in practice this generally requires a two stage rotary vane or other medium type of vacuum pump to go much beyond (lower than) 1 torr.</p>
<h3 id="measuring-instruments">Measuring instruments</h3>
<p>Many devices are used to measure the pressure in a vacuum, depending on what range of vacuum is needed.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Hydrostatic</strong> gauges (such as the mercury column <a href="manometer" class="uri" title="wikilink">manometer</a>) consist of a vertical column of liquid in a tube whose ends are exposed to different pressures. The column will rise or fall until its weight is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube. The simplest design is a closed-end U-shaped tube, one side of which is connected to the region of interest. Any fluid can be used, but <a href="Mercury_(element)" title="wikilink">mercury</a> is preferred for its high density and low vapour pressure. Simple hydrostatic gauges can measure pressures ranging from 1 torr (100 Pa) to above atmospheric. An important variation is the <a href="McLeod_gauge" title="wikilink">McLeod gauge</a> which isolates a known volume of vacuum and compresses it to multiply the height variation of the liquid column. The McLeod gauge can measure vacuums as high as 10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;6</sup> torr (0.1 mPa), which is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology. Other vacuum gauges can measure lower pressures, but only indirectly by measurement of other pressure-controlled properties. These indirect measurements must be calibrated via a direct measurement, most commonly a McLeod gauge.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Mechanical</strong> or <strong>elastic</strong> gauges depend on a Bourdon tube, diaphragm, or capsule, usually made of metal, which will change shape in response to the pressure of the region in question. A variation on this idea is the <strong>capacitance manometer</strong>, in which the diaphragm makes up a part of a capacitor. A change in pressure leads to the flexure of the diaphragm, which results in a change in capacitance. These gauges are effective from 10<sup>+3</sup> torr to 10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;4</sup> torr, and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Thermal conductivity</strong> gauges rely on the fact that the ability of a gas to conduct heat decreases with pressure. In this type of gauge, a wire filament is heated by running current through it. A <a href="thermocouple" class="uri" title="wikilink">thermocouple</a> or <a href="Resistance_Temperature_Detector" title="wikilink">Resistance Temperature Detector</a> (RTD) can then be used to measure the temperature of the filament. This temperature is dependent on the rate at which the filament loses heat to the surrounding gas, and therefore on the thermal conductivity. A common variant is the <a href="Pirani_gauge" title="wikilink">Pirani gauge</a> which uses a single platimum filament as both the heated element and RTD. These gauges are accurate from 10 torr to 10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;3</sup> torr, but they are sensitive to the chemical composition of the gases being measured.</p>
<p><strong><a href="Ion_gauge" title="wikilink">Ion gauges</a></strong> are used in ultrahigh vacuum. They come in two types: hot cathode and cold cathode. In the <a href="Hot_filament_ionization_gauge" title="wikilink">hot cathode</a> version an electrically heated filament produces an electron beam. The electrons travel through the gauge and ionize gas molecules around them. The resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode. The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on the pressure in the gauge. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;3</sup> torr to 10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;10</sup> torr. The principle behind <a href="cold_cathode" title="wikilink">cold cathode</a> version is the same, except that electrons are produced in a discharge created by a high voltage electrical discharge. Cold cathode gauges are accurate from 10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;2</sup> torr to 10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;9</sup> torr. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits. Their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum. The composition of gases at high vacuums will usually be unpredictable, so a mass spectrometer must be used in conjunction with the ionization gauge for accurate measurement.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>Vacuum is useful in a variety of processes and devices.

High to ultra-high vacuum removes the obstruction of air, allowing particle beams to deposit or remove materials without contamination. This is the principle behind <a href="chemical_vapor_deposition" title="wikilink">chemical vapor deposition</a>, <a href="physical_vapor_deposition" title="wikilink">physical vapor deposition</a>, and <a href="dry_etching" title="wikilink">dry etching</a> which are essential to the fabrication of <a href="semiconductor_fabrication" title="wikilink">semiconductors</a> and <a href="optical_coating" title="wikilink">optical coatings</a>, and to <a href="surface_science" title="wikilink">surface science</a>. The reduction of convection provides the thermal insulation of <a href="thermos_bottle" title="wikilink">thermos bottles</a>.

<h3 id="outgassing">Outgassing</h3>

<p><a href="Evaporation" class="uri" title="wikilink">Evaporation</a> and <a href="sublimation_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">sublimation</a> into a vacuum is called <a href="outgassing" class="uri" title="wikilink">outgassing</a>. All materials, solid or liquid, have a small <a href="vapour_pressure" title="wikilink">vapour pressure</a>, and their outgassing becomes important when the vacuum pressure falls below this vapour pressure. In man-made systems, outgassing has the same effect as a leak and can limit the achievable vacuum. Outgassing products may condense on nearby colder surfaces, which can be troublesome if they obscure optical instruments or react with other materials. This is of great concern to space missions, where an obscured telescope or solar cell can ruin an expensive mission.</p>
<p>The most prevalent outgassing product in man-made vacuum systems is water absorbed by chamber materials. It can be reduced by desiccating or baking the chamber, and removing absorbent materials. Outgassed water can condense in the oil of <a href="rotary_vane_pump" title="wikilink">rotary vane pumps</a> and reduce their net speed drastically if gas ballasting is not used. High vacuum systems must be clean and free of organic matter to minimize outgassing.</p>
<p>Ultra-high vacuum systems are usually baked, preferably under vacuum, to temporarily raise the vapour pressure of all outgassing materials and boil them off. Once the bulk of the outgassing materials are boiled off and evacuated, the system may be cooled to lower vapour pressures and minimize residual outgassing during actual operation. Some systems are cooled well below room temperature by <a href="liquid_nitrogen" title="wikilink">liquid nitrogen</a> to shut down residual outgassing and simultaneously <a href="cryopump" class="uri" title="wikilink">cryopump</a> the system.</p>

<p>Fluids cannot generally be pulled, so a vacuum cannot be created by <a href="suction" class="uri" title="wikilink">suction</a>. Suction can spread and dilute a vacuum by letting a higher pressure push fluids into it, but the vacuum has to be created first before suction can occur. The easiest way to create an artificial vacuum is to expand the volume of a container. For example, the <a href="diaphragm_(anatomy)" title="wikilink">diaphragm muscle</a> expands the chest cavity, which causes the volume of the lungs to increase. This expansion reduces the pressure and creates a partial vacuum, which is soon filled by air pushed in by atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>To continue evacuating a chamber indefinitely without requiring infinite growth, a compartment of the vacuum can be repeatedly closed off, exhausted, and expanded again. This is the principle behind <a href="vacuum_pump#Positive_displacement" title="wikilink">positive displacement</a> pumps, like the manual water pump for example. Inside the pump, a mechanism expands a small sealed cavity to create a vacuum. Because of the pressure differential, some fluid from the chamber (or the well, in our example) is pushed into the pump's small cavity. The pump's cavity is then sealed from the chamber, opened to the atmosphere, and squeezed back to a minute size.</p>

<p>The above explanation is merely a simple introduction to vacuum pumping, and is not representative of the entire range of pumps in use. Many variations of the positive displacement pump have been developed, and many other pump designs rely on fundamentally different principles. <a href="vacuum_pump#Momentum_transfer" title="wikilink">Momentum transfer</a> pumps, which bear some similarities to dynamic pumps used at higher pressures, can achieve much higher quality vacuums than positive displacement pumps. <a href="vacuum_pump#Entrapment" title="wikilink">Entrapment</a> pumps can capture gases in a solid or absorbed state, often with no moving parts, no seals and no vibration. None of these pumps are universal; each type has important performance limitations. They all share a difficulty in pumping low molecular weight gases, especially <a href="hydrogen" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a>, <a href="helium" class="uri" title="wikilink">helium</a>, and <a href="neon" class="uri" title="wikilink">neon</a>.</p>
<p>The lowest pressure that can be attained in a system is also dependent on many things other than the nature of the pumps. Multiple pumps may be connected in series, called stages, to achieve higher vacuums. The choice of seals, chamber geometry, materials, and pump-down procedures will all have an impact. Collectively, these are called <em>vacuum technique</em>. And sometimes, the final pressure is not the only relevant characteristic. Pumping systems differ in oil contamination, vibration, preferential pumping of certain gases, pump-down speeds, intermittent duty cycle, reliability, or tolerance to high leakage rates.</p>
<p>In <a href="ultra_high_vacuum" title="wikilink">ultra high vacuum</a> systems, some very &quot;odd&quot; leakage paths and outgassing sources must be considered. The water absorption of <a href="aluminium" class="uri" title="wikilink">aluminium</a> and <a href="palladium" class="uri" title="wikilink">palladium</a> becomes an unacceptable source of outgassing, and even the adsorptivity of hard metals such as stainless steel or <a href="titanium" class="uri" title="wikilink">titanium</a> must be considered. Some oils and greases will boil off in extreme vacuums. The permeability of the metallic chamber walls may have to be considered, and the grain direction of the metallic flanges should be parallel to the flange face.</p>
<p>The lowest pressures currently achievable in laboratory are about 10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;13</sup> torr (13 pPa).<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> However, pressures as low as  (6.7 fPa) have been indirectly measured in a 4 K cryogenic vacuum system.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> This corresponds to &lt;U+2248&gt;100 particles/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>Humans and animals exposed to vacuum will lose <a href="consciousness" class="uri" title="wikilink">consciousness</a> after a few seconds and die of <a href="Hypoxia_(medical)" title="wikilink">hypoxia</a> within minutes, but the symptoms are not nearly as graphic as commonly depicted in media and popular culture. The reduction in pressure lowers the temperature at which <a href="blood" class="uri" title="wikilink">blood</a> and other body fluids boil, but the elastic pressure of blood vessels ensures that this boiling point remains above the internal body temperature of <a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Although the blood will not boil, the formation of gas bubbles in bodily fluids at reduced pressures, known as <a href="ebullism" class="uri" title="wikilink">ebullism</a>, is still a concern. The gas may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Swelling and ebullism can be restrained by containment in a <a href="flight_suit" title="wikilink">flight suit</a>. <a href="Space_Shuttle_program" title="wikilink">Shuttle</a> astronauts wore a fitted elastic garment called the Crew Altitude Protection Suit (CAPS) which prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kPa (15 Torr).<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Rapid boiling will cool the skin and create frost, particularly in the mouth, but this is not a significant hazard.</p>
<p>Animal experiments show that rapid and complete recovery is normal for exposures shorter than 90 seconds, while longer full-body exposures are fatal and resuscitation has never been successful.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> There is only a limited amount of data available from human accidents, but it is consistent with animal data. Limbs may be exposed for much longer if breathing is not impaired.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> <a href="Robert_Boyle" title="wikilink">Robert Boyle</a> was the first to show in 1660 that vacuum is lethal to small animals.</p>
<p>An experiment indicates that plants are able to survive in a low pressure environment (1.5 kPa) for about 30 minutes.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>During 1942, in one of a series of <a href="Nazi_human_experimentation" title="wikilink">experiments on human subjects</a> for the <a href="Luftwaffe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luftwaffe</a>, the <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi regime</a> <a href="human_experimentation" title="wikilink">experimented</a> on prisoners in <a href="Dachau_concentration_camp" title="wikilink">Dachau concentration camp</a> by exposing them to low pressure.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Cold or oxygen-rich atmospheres can sustain life at pressures much lower than atmospheric, as long as the density of oxygen is similar to that of standard sea-level atmosphere. The colder air temperatures found at altitudes of up to 3 km generally compensate for the lower pressures there.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Above this altitude, oxygen enrichment is necessary to prevent <a href="altitude_sickness" title="wikilink">altitude sickness</a> in humans that did not undergo prior <a href="acclimatization" class="uri" title="wikilink">acclimatization</a>, and <a href="spacesuit" title="wikilink">spacesuits</a> are necessary to prevent ebullism above 19 km.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Most spacesuits use only 20 kPa (150 Torr) of pure oxygen. This pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism, but <a href="decompression_sickness" title="wikilink">decompression sickness</a> and <a href="air_embolism" title="wikilink">gas embolisms</a> can still occur if decompression rates are not managed.</p>
<p>Rapid decompression can be much more dangerous than vacuum exposure itself. Even if the victim does not hold his or her breath, venting through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the fatal rupture of the delicate <a href="alveoli" class="uri" title="wikilink">alveoli</a> of the <a href="lung" title="wikilink">lungs</a>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> <a href="Eardrum" title="wikilink">Eardrums</a> and sinuses may be ruptured by rapid decompression, soft tissues may bruise and seep blood, and the stress of shock will accelerate oxygen consumption leading to hypoxia.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Injuries caused by rapid decompression are called <a href="barotrauma" class="uri" title="wikilink">barotrauma</a>. A pressure drop of 13 kPa (100 Torr), which produces no symptoms if it is gradual, may be fatal if it occurs suddenly.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Some <a href="extremophile" class="uri" title="wikilink">extremophile</a> microrganisms, such as <a href="tardigrade" title="wikilink">tardigrades</a>, can survive vacuum for a period of days.</p>
