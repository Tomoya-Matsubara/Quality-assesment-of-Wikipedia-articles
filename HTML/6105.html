<p>The <strong>National Physicians Alliance</strong> (<strong>NPA</strong>) is a national, multi-specialty medical organization founded in 2005. The organization's mission statement reads: &quot;The National Physicians Alliance creates research and education programs that promote health and foster active engagement of physicians with their communities to achieve high quality, affordable health care for all. The NPA offers a professional home to physicians across medical specialties who share a commitment to professional integrity and health justice.&quot;</p>
<p>The NPA was founded by former leaders of the <a href="American_Medical_Student_Association" title="wikilink">American Medical Student Association</a> as an alternative to traditional trade associations that primarily serve the economic interests of physicians rather than advocating first and foremost on behalf of patients and public health. In order to avoid <a href="conflicts_of_interest" title="wikilink">conflicts of interest</a>, the NPA does not accept funding from <a href="pharmaceutical" class="uri" title="wikilink">pharmaceutical</a> or <a href="medical_device" title="wikilink">medical device</a> companies.</p>
<p>NPA's guiding principles focus on health and wellness, avoiding conflicts of interest that might affect medical decisions,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> collaborative and team-based care, and addressing social determinants of health.</p>
<p>Currently, there are four issues that are claimed to be the focus of NPA's work</p>
<ol>
<li>Integrity and Trust in Medicine</li>
<li>Equitable, Affordable Health Care for All</li>
<li>Patient Safety and Systems Improvement</li>
<li>Civic Engagement</li>
</ol>

The concept encourages patients to choose care that is supported by evidence, not duplicative of other tests or procedures already received, free from harm, and truly necessary.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The &quot;Choosing Wisely&quot; Campaign won a &quot;Foremother Award&quot; from the <a href="National_Research_Center_for_Women_and_Families" title="wikilink">National Research Center for Women and Families</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Their &quot;Good Stewardship&quot; campaign on eliminating the top 5 unnecessary medical treatments led to an articles in the <a href="Journal_of_the_American_Medical_Association" title="wikilink">Journal of the American Medical Association</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
