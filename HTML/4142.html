The earliest instant of the Big Bang expansion is still an area of open investigation. The Big Bang theory does not provide any explanation for the initial conditions of the universe; rather, it describes and explains the general evolution of the universe going forward from that point on.</p>
<p><a href="Georges_Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre" title="wikilink">Georges Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre</a> first proposed what became the Big Bang theory in what he called his &quot;hypothesis of the primeval atom&quot;. Over time, scientists built on his initial ideas to form the modern synthesis. The framework for the Big Bang model relies on <a href="Albert_Einstein" title="wikilink">Albert Einstein</a>'s <a href="general_relativity" title="wikilink">general relativity</a> and on simplifying assumptions such as <a href="homogeneity_(physics)#Translation_invariance" title="wikilink">homogeneity</a> and <a href="isotropy" class="uri" title="wikilink">isotropy</a> of space. The governing equations were first formulated by <a href="Alexander_Friedmann" title="wikilink">Alexander Friedmann</a> and similar solutions were worked on by <a href="Willem_de_Sitter" title="wikilink">Willem de Sitter</a>. In 1929, <a href="Edwin_Hubble" title="wikilink">Edwin Hubble</a> discovered that the distances to far away galaxies were <a href="Proportionality_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">strongly correlated</a> with their <a href="redshift" title="wikilink">redshifts</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;an idea originally suggested by Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre in 1927. Hubble's observation was taken to indicate that all very distant galaxies and clusters have an apparent velocity directly away from our vantage point: the farther away, the higher the apparent velocity, regardless of direction.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> <a href="Copernican_principle" title="wikilink">Assuming that we are not at the center</a> of a giant explosion, the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are <a href="Metric_expansion_of_space" title="wikilink">receding from each other</a>.</p>
<p>While the scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different expanding universe theories&lt;U+2014&gt;the Big Bang and the <a href="Steady_State_theory" title="wikilink">Steady State theory</a>,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> observational confirmation of the Big Bang scenario came with the discovery of the <a href="cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" title="wikilink">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> in 1964, and later when its spectrum (i.e., the amount of radiation measured at each wavelength) was found to match that of thermal radiation from a <a href="black_body" title="wikilink">black body</a>.

<p>Extrapolation of the expansion of the Universe backwards in time using general relativity yields an infinite <a href="density" class="uri" title="wikilink">density</a> and temperature at a finite time in the past.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> This <a href="gravitational_singularity" title="wikilink">singularity</a> signals the breakdown of general relativity.

<p>The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the Universe was filled <a href="Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity" title="wikilink">homogeneously</a> and <a href="isotropic" title="wikilink">isotropically</a> with an incredibly high <a href="energy_density" title="wikilink">energy density</a> and huge temperatures and <a href="pressure" title="wikilink">pressures</a> and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;37</sup> seconds into the expansion, a <a href="phase_transition" title="wikilink">phase transition</a> caused a <a href="cosmic_inflation" title="wikilink">cosmic inflation</a>, during which the Universe grew <a href="exponential_growth" title="wikilink">exponentially</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> After inflation stopped, the Universe consisted of a <a href="quark&lt;U+2013&gt;gluon_plasma" title="wikilink">quark&lt;U+2013&gt;gluon plasma</a>, as well as all other <a href="elementary_particle" title="wikilink">elementary particles</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at <a href="Special_relativity" title="wikilink">relativistic</a> <a href="Relativistic_speed" title="wikilink">speeds</a>, and <a href="pair_production" title="wikilink">particle&lt;U+2013&gt;antiparticle pairs</a> of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point an unknown reaction called <a href="baryogenesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">baryogenesis</a> violated the conservation of <a href="baryon_number" title="wikilink">baryon number</a>, leading to a very small excess of <a href="quark" title="wikilink">quarks</a> and <a href="lepton" title="wikilink">leptons</a> over antiquarks and antileptons&lt;U+2014&gt;of the order of one part in 30 million. This resulted in the predominance of <a href="matter" class="uri" title="wikilink">matter</a> over <a href="antimatter" class="uri" title="wikilink">antimatter</a> in the present Universe.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>  The Universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. <a href="Explicit_symmetry_breaking" title="wikilink">Symmetry breaking</a> phase transitions put the <a href="fundamental_force" title="wikilink">fundamental forces</a> of physics and the parameters of <a href="elementary_particles" title="wikilink">elementary particles</a> into their present form.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> After about 10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;11</sup> seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in <a href="particle_physics" title="wikilink">particle physics</a> experiments. At about 10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;6</sup> seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form <a href="baryon" title="wikilink">baryons</a> such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton&lt;U+2013&gt;antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons&lt;U+2013&gt;antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 10<sup>10</sup> of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the Universe was dominated by <a href="photon" title="wikilink">photons</a> (with a minor contribution from <a href="neutrino" title="wikilink">neutrinos</a>).</p>
<p>A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion (one thousand million; 10<sup>9</sup>; SI prefix <a href="giga-" class="uri" title="wikilink">giga-</a>) <a href="kelvin" class="uri" title="wikilink">kelvin</a> and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the Universe's <a href="deuterium" class="uri" title="wikilink">deuterium</a> and helium <a href="atomic_nucleus" title="wikilink">nuclei</a> in a process called <a href="Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis" title="wikilink">Big Bang nucleosynthesis</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei. As the Universe cooled, the <a href="rest_mass" title="wikilink">rest mass</a> energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon <a href="electromagnetic_radiation" title="wikilink">radiation</a>. After about 379,000 years the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation is known as the <a href="cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" title="wikilink">cosmic microwave background radiation</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Over a long period of time, the slightly denser regions of the nearly uniformly distributed matter gravitationally attracted nearby matter and thus grew even denser, forming gas clouds, stars, galaxies, and the other astronomical structures observable today. The details of this process depend on the amount and type of matter in the Universe. The four possible types of matter are known as <a href="cold_dark_matter" title="wikilink">cold dark matter</a>, <a href="warm_dark_matter" title="wikilink">warm dark matter</a>, <a href="hot_dark_matter" title="wikilink">hot dark matter</a>, and <a href="baryonic_matter" title="wikilink">baryonic matter</a>. The best measurements available (from <a href="WMAP" class="uri" title="wikilink">WMAP</a>) show that the data is well-fit by a Lambda-CDM model in which dark matter is assumed to be cold (warm dark matter is ruled out by early <a href="reionization" class="uri" title="wikilink">reionization</a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a>), and is estimated to make up about 23% of the matter/energy of the universe, while baryonic matter makes up about 4.6%.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In an &quot;extended model&quot; which includes hot dark matter in the form of <a href="neutrino" title="wikilink">neutrinos</a>, then if the &quot;physical baryon density&quot; &lt;U+03A9&gt;<sub>b</sub>h<sup>2</sup> is estimated at about 0.023 (this is different from the 'baryon density' &lt;U+03A9&gt;<sub>b</sub> expressed as a fraction of the total matter/energy density, which as noted above is about 0.046), and the corresponding cold dark matter density &lt;U+03A9&gt;<sub>c</sub>h<sup>2</sup> is about 0.11, the corresponding neutrino density &lt;U+03A9&gt;<sub>v</sub>h<sup>2</sup> is estimated to be less than 0.0062.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Independent lines of evidence from Type Ia supernovae and the <a href="Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" title="wikilink">CMB</a> imply that the Universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as <a href="dark_energy" title="wikilink">dark energy</a>, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's Universe is in this form. When the Universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity had the upper hand, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the <a href="Hubble&#39;s_law" title="wikilink">expansion of the Universe</a> to slowly begin to accelerate. Dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the <a href="cosmological_constant" title="wikilink">cosmological constant</a> term in <a href="Einstein&#39;s_field_equation" title="wikilink">Einstein's field equations</a> of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its <a href="equation_of_state_(cosmology)" title="wikilink">equation of state</a> and relationship with the <a href="Standard_Model" title="wikilink">Standard Model</a> of particle physics continue to be investigated both observationally and theoretically.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>All of this cosmic evolution after the <a href="inflationary_epoch" title="wikilink">inflationary epoch</a> can be rigorously described and modeled by the &lt;U+039B&gt;CDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and Einstein's General Relativity. As noted above, there is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;15</sup> seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of <a href="quantum_gravity" title="wikilink">quantum gravitation</a> is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the Universe is currently one of the greatest <a href="unsolved_problems_in_physics" title="wikilink">unsolved problems in physics</a>.</p>
<h3 id="underlying-assumptions">Underlying assumptions</h3>
<p>The Big Bang theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of <a href="physical_law" title="wikilink">physical laws</a> and the <a href="cosmological_principle" title="wikilink">cosmological principle</a>. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the Universe is <a href="Homogeneous_space" title="wikilink">homogeneous</a> and <a href="isotropy" title="wikilink">isotropic</a>.</p>
<p>These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but today there are efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the <a href="fine_structure_constant" title="wikilink">fine structure constant</a> over much of the <a href="age_of_the_universe" title="wikilink">age of the universe</a> is of order 10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;5</sup>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Also, general relativity has passed stringent <a href="tests_of_general_relativity" title="wikilink">tests</a> on the scale of the Solar System and binary stars.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>If the large-scale Universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle can be derived from the simpler <a href="Copernican_principle" title="wikilink">Copernican principle</a>, which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;5</sup> via observations of the CMB.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The Universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="flrw-metric">FLRW metric</h3>

<p>General relativity describes spacetime by a <a href="metric_tensor" title="wikilink">metric</a>, which determines the distances that separate nearby points. The points, which can be galaxies, stars, or other objects, themselves are specified using a <a href="coordinate_chart" title="wikilink">coordinate chart</a> or &quot;grid&quot; that is laid down over all <a href="spacetime" class="uri" title="wikilink">spacetime</a>. The cosmological principle implies that the metric should be <a href="Homogeneous_space" title="wikilink">homogeneous</a> and <a href="isotropic" class="uri" title="wikilink">isotropic</a> on large scales, which uniquely singles out the <a href="Friedmann&lt;U+2013&gt;Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre&lt;U+2013&gt;Robertson&lt;U+2013&gt;Walker_metric" title="wikilink">Friedmann&lt;U+2013&gt;Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre&lt;U+2013&gt;Robertson&lt;U+2013&gt;Walker metric</a> (FLRW metric). This metric contains a <a href="scale_factor" title="wikilink">scale factor</a>, which describes how the size of the Universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a <a href="coordinate_system" title="wikilink">coordinate system</a> to be made, called <a href="comoving_coordinates" title="wikilink">comoving coordinates</a>. In this coordinate system the grid expands along with the Universe, and objects that are moving only due to the expansion of the Universe remain at fixed points on the grid. While their <em>coordinate</em> distance (<a href="comoving_distance" title="wikilink">comoving distance</a>) remains constant, the <em>physical</em> distance between two such comoving points expands proportionally with the <a href="scale_factor" title="wikilink">scale factor</a> of the Universe.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, <a href="metric_expansion_of_space" title="wikilink">space itself expands</a> with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our Universe only on large scales&lt;U+2014&gt;local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.</p>
<h3 id="horizons">Horizons</h3>

<p>An important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of <a href="Particle_horizon#Particle_horizon" title="wikilink">horizons</a>. Since the Universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a <em>past horizon</em> on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never &quot;catch up&quot; to very distant objects. This defines a <em>future horizon</em>, which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the FLRW model that describes our Universe. Our understanding of the Universe back to very early times <a href="Big_Bang#Horizon_problem" title="wikilink">suggests</a> that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the Universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion of the Universe continues to <a href="accelerating_universe" title="wikilink">accelerate</a>, there is a future horizon as well.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

Independently deriving Friedmann's equations in 1927, <a href="Georges_Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre" title="wikilink">Georges Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre</a>, a Belgian physicist and <a href="Roman_Catholic" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a> priest, proposed that the inferred recession of the nebulae was due to the expansion of the Universe.<ref name=gl1927>

<p>In 1931 Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre went further and suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that the further in the past the smaller the universe was, until at some finite time in the past all the mass of the Universe was concentrated into a single point, a &quot;primeval atom&quot; where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Starting in 1924, Hubble painstakingly developed a series of distance indicators, the forerunner of the <a href="cosmic_distance_ladder" title="wikilink">cosmic distance ladder</a>, using the  Hooker telescope at <a href="Mount_Wilson_Observatory" title="wikilink">Mount Wilson Observatory</a>. This allowed him to estimate distances to galaxies whose redshifts had already been measured, mostly by Slipher. In 1929 Hubble discovered a correlation between distance and recession velocity&lt;U+2014&gt;now known as <a href="Hubble&#39;s_law" title="wikilink">Hubble's law</a>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre had already shown that this was expected, given the <a href="Cosmological_Principle" title="wikilink">Cosmological Principle</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal <a href="Steady_state_theory" title="wikilink">steady state</a> Universe, and several complained that the beginning of time implied by the Big Bang imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady state theory.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> This perception was enhanced by the fact that the originator of the Big Bang theory, Monsignor Georges Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre, was a Roman Catholic priest.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> <a href="Arthur_Eddington" title="wikilink">Arthur Eddington</a> agreed with <a href="Aristotle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a> that the universe did not have a beginning in time, viz., that <a href="Arguments_for_eternity#Argument_from_the_nature_of_matter" title="wikilink">matter is eternal</a>.

<p>If the world has begun with a single <a href="Quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum</a>, the notions of space and time would altogether fail to have any meaning at the beginning; they would only begin to have a sensible meaning when the original quantum had been divided into a sufficient number of quanta.

<p>During the 1930s other ideas were proposed as <a href="non-standard_cosmologies" title="wikilink">non-standard cosmologies</a> to explain Hubble's observations, including the <a href="Milne_model" title="wikilink">Milne model</a>,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> the <a href="oscillatory_Universe" title="wikilink">oscillatory Universe</a> (originally suggested by Friedmann, but advocated by Albert Einstein and <a href="Richard_Tolman" title="wikilink">Richard Tolman</a>)<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> and <a href="Fritz_Zwicky" title="wikilink">Fritz Zwicky</a>'s <a href="tired_light" title="wikilink">tired light</a> hypothesis.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>After <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, two distinct possibilities emerged. One was Fred Hoyle's <a href="steady_state_model" title="wikilink">steady state model</a>, whereby new matter would be created as the Universe seemed to expand. In this model the Universe is roughly the same at any point in time.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The other was Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre's Big Bang theory, advocated and developed by <a href="George_Gamow" title="wikilink">George Gamow</a>, who introduced <a href="big_bang_nucleosynthesis" title="wikilink">big bang nucleosynthesis</a> (BBN)<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> and whose associates, <a href="Ralph_Alpher" title="wikilink">Ralph Alpher</a> and <a href="Robert_Herman" title="wikilink">Robert Herman</a>, predicted the <a href="cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" title="wikilink">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> (CMB).<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Ironically, it was Hoyle who coined the phrase that came to be applied to Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre's theory, referring to it as &quot;this <em>big bang</em> idea&quot; during a <a href="BBC_Radio" title="wikilink">BBC Radio</a> broadcast in March 1949.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|It is commonly reported that Hoyle intended this to be pejorative.

Eventually, the observational evidence, most notably from radio <a href="source_counts" title="wikilink">source counts</a>, began to favor Big Bang over Steady State. The discovery and confirmation of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the cosmos. Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the Big Bang, understanding the physics of the Universe at earlier and earlier times, and reconciling observations with the basic theory.</p>
<p>Significant progress in Big Bang cosmology have been made since the late 1990s as a result of advances in <a href="telescope" class="uri" title="wikilink">telescope</a> technology as well as the analysis of data from satellites such as <a href="Cosmic_Background_Explorer" title="wikilink">COBE</a>,<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> the <a href="Hubble_Space_Telescope" title="wikilink">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and <a href="WMAP" class="uri" title="wikilink">WMAP</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Cosmologists now have fairly precise and accurate measurements of many of the parameters of the Big Bang model, and have made the unexpected discovery that the expansion of the Universe appears to be accelerating.</p>
<h2 id="observational-evidence">Observational evidence</h2>

<p>The earliest and most direct observational evidence of the validity of the theory are the expansion of the universe according to <a href="Hubble&#39;s_law" title="wikilink">Hubble's law</a> (as indicated by the redshifts of galaxies), discovery and measurement of the <a href="cosmic_microwave_background" title="wikilink">cosmic microwave background</a> and the relative abundances of light elements produced by <a href="Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis" title="wikilink">Big Bang nucleosynthesis</a>.

<p>Observations of distant galaxies and <a href="quasar" title="wikilink">quasars</a> show that these objects are redshifted&lt;U+2014&gt;the <a href="light" class="uri" title="wikilink">light</a> emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths. This can be seen by taking a <a href="frequency_spectrum" title="wikilink">frequency spectrum</a> of an object and matching the <a href="spectroscopy" title="wikilink">spectroscopic</a> pattern of <a href="emission_line" title="wikilink">emission lines</a> or <a href="absorption_line" title="wikilink">absorption lines</a> corresponding to <a href="atom" title="wikilink">atoms</a> of the <a href="chemical_element" title="wikilink">chemical elements</a> interacting with the light.

If the redshift is interpreted as a Doppler shift, the recessional <a href="velocity" class="uri" title="wikilink">velocity</a> of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the <a href="cosmic_distance_ladder" title="wikilink">cosmic distance ladder</a>. When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as Hubble's law is observed:<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>

</ul>
<p><a href="Hubble&#39;s_law" title="wikilink">Hubble's law</a> has two possible explanations. Either we are at the center of an explosion of galaxies&lt;U+2014&gt;which is untenable given the <a href="Copernican_principle" title="wikilink">Copernican principle</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;or the Universe is <a href="Metric_expansion_of_space" title="wikilink">uniformly expanding</a> everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> and Georges Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre in 1927,<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by <a href="Friedmann&lt;U+2013&gt;Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre&lt;U+2013&gt;Robertson&lt;U+2013&gt;Walker_metric" title="wikilink">Friedmann, Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre, Robertson, and Walker</a>.</p>
<p>The theory requires the relation <em>v</em> = <em>HD</em> to hold at all times, where <em>D</em> is the <a href="comoving_distance" title="wikilink">comoving distance</a>, <em>v</em> is the <a href="recessional_velocity" title="wikilink">recessional velocity</a>, and <em>v</em>, <em>H</em>, and <em>D</em> vary as the Universe expands (hence we write <em>H</em><sub>0</sub> to denote the present-day Hubble &quot;constant&quot;). For distances much smaller than the size of the <a href="observable_Universe" title="wikilink">observable Universe</a>, the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity <em>v</em>. However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the Universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>That <a href="Metric_expansion_of_space" title="wikilink">space is undergoing metric expansion</a> is shown by direct observational evidence of the <a href="Cosmological_principle" title="wikilink">Cosmological principle</a> and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely <a href="isotropic" class="uri" title="wikilink">isotropic</a> and <a href="Homogeneity_(physics)#Translation_invariance" title="wikilink">homogenous</a>,<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> supporting the Cosmological principle that the Universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts were the result of an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.</p>
<p>Measurements of the effects of the <a href="cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" title="wikilink">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Radiation from the Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times throughout the Universe. Uniform cooling of the cosmic microwave background over billions of years is explainable only if the Universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.</p>

Populations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early Universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state).

These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model.

<p>In 2011 astronomers found what they believe to be pristine clouds of primordial gas, by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Since the clouds of gas have no heavy elements, they likely formed in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, during <a href="Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis" title="wikilink">Big Bang nucleosynthesis</a>.

However, observations suggest that the Universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the <a href="Sakharov_conditions" title="wikilink">Sakharov conditions</a> must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that <a href="C-symmetry" class="uri" title="wikilink">C-symmetry</a> and <a href="CP-symmetry" class="uri" title="wikilink">CP-symmetry</a> are violated and that the Universe depart from <a href="thermodynamic_equilibrium" title="wikilink">thermodynamic equilibrium</a>.<ref name="sakharov">  </p>

<h3 id="dark-energy">Dark energy</h3>

<p>Measurements of the <a href="redshift" class="uri" title="wikilink">redshift</a>&lt;U+2013&gt;<a href="apparent_magnitude" title="wikilink">magnitude</a> relation for <a href="type_Ia_supernova" title="wikilink">type Ia supernovae</a> indicate that the expansion of the Universe has been <a href="accelerating_universe" title="wikilink">accelerating</a> since the Universe was about half its present age. To explain this acceleration, general relativity requires that much of the energy in the Universe consists of a component with large <a href="equation_of_state_(cosmology)" title="wikilink">negative pressure</a>, dubbed &quot;dark energy&quot;. Dark energy, though speculative, solves numerous problems. Measurements of the <a href="cosmic_microwave_background" title="wikilink">cosmic microwave background</a> indicate that the Universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the Universe must have almost exactly the <a href="Critical_density_(cosmology)" title="wikilink">critical density</a> of mass/energy. But the mass density of the Universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the &quot;missing&quot; energy density. Dark energy also helps to explain two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the Universe, one using the frequency of <a href="gravitational_lens" title="wikilink">gravitational lenses</a>, and the other using the characteristic pattern of the <a href="large-scale_structure_of_the_universe" title="wikilink">large-scale structure</a> as a cosmic ruler.</p>
<p>Negative pressure is believed to be a property of <a href="vacuum_energy" title="wikilink">vacuum energy</a>, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Possible candidates include a <a href="cosmological_constant" title="wikilink">cosmological constant</a> and <a href="quintessence_(physics)" title="wikilink">quintessence</a>. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the Universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the Universe expands. Therefore matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the Universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant.</p>

</figure>
<p>During the 1970s and 1980s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the Universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the Universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal <a href="baryon" title="wikilink">baryonic</a> matter. In addition, the assumption that the Universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the Universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, <a href="galaxy_cluster" title="wikilink">galaxy cluster</a> velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, <a href="gravitational_lensing" title="wikilink">gravitational lensing</a> studies, and <a href="X-ray_astronomy" title="wikilink">X-ray measurements</a> of galaxy clusters.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>Indirect evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, as no dark matter particles have been observed in laboratories. Many <a href="particle_physics" title="wikilink">particle physics</a> candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="globular-cluster-age">Globular cluster age</h3>
<p>In the mid-1990s observations of <a href="globular_cluster" title="wikilink">globular clusters</a> appeared to be inconsistent with the Big Bang theory. Computer simulations that matched the observations of the <a href="star" title="wikilink">stellar</a> populations of globular clusters suggested that they were about 15 billion years old, which conflicted with the 13.8 billion year age of the Universe. This issue was partially resolved in the late 1990s when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to <a href="stellar_wind" title="wikilink">stellar winds</a>, indicated a much younger age for globular clusters.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> There remain some questions as to how accurately the ages of the clusters are measured, but it is clear that observations of globular clusters no longer appear inconsistent with the Big Bang theory.</p>
<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
<p>There are generally considered to be three outstanding problems with the Big Bang theory: the <a href="horizon_problem" title="wikilink">horizon problem</a>, the <a href="flatness_problem" title="wikilink">flatness problem</a>, and the <a href="magnetic_monopole" title="wikilink">magnetic monopole problem</a>. The most common answer to these problems is <a href="Cosmic_inflation" title="wikilink">inflationary theory</a>; however, since this creates new problems, other options have been proposed, such as the <a href="Weyl_curvature_hypothesis" title="wikilink">Weyl curvature hypothesis</a>.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a><a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="horizon-problem">Horizon problem</h3>

<p>The horizon problem results from the premise that information cannot travel <a href="faster_than_light" title="wikilink">faster than light</a>. In a Universe of finite age this sets a limit&lt;U+2014&gt;the <a href="particle_horizon" title="wikilink">particle horizon</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;on the separation of any two regions of space that are in <a href="causality_(physics)" title="wikilink">causal</a> contact.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> The observed isotropy of the <a href="Cosmic_microwave_background" title="wikilink">CMB</a> is problematic in this regard: if the Universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature.</p>
<p>A resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by <a href="inflationary_theory" title="wikilink">inflationary theory</a> in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the Universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the Universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable Universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.</p>
<p><a href="Heisenberg&#39;s_uncertainty_principle" title="wikilink">Heisenberg's uncertainty principle</a> predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be <a href="primordial_fluctuations" title="wikilink">quantum thermal fluctuations</a>, which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the Universe. Inflation predicts that the <a href="primordial_fluctuations" title="wikilink">primordial fluctuations</a> are nearly <a href="Scale_invariance" title="wikilink">scale invariant</a> and <a href="Normal_distribution" title="wikilink">Gaussian</a>, which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.</p>
<p>If inflation occurred, exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon.</p>

<p>The flatness problem (also known as the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a <a href="Friedmann&lt;U+2013&gt;Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre&lt;U+2013&gt;Robertson&lt;U+2013&gt;Walker_metric" title="wikilink">Friedmann&lt;U+2013&gt;Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre&lt;U+2013&gt;Robertson&lt;U+2013&gt;Walker metric</a>.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> The Universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial <a href="curvature" class="uri" title="wikilink">curvature</a> depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative if its density is less than the <a href="Critical_density_(cosmology)" title="wikilink">critical density</a>, positive if greater, and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be <em>flat</em>. The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the Universe today remains very close to flat.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the <a href="Planck_time" title="wikilink">Planck time</a>, 10<sup>&lt;U+2212&gt;43</sup> seconds, the fact that the Universe has reached neither a <a href="heat_death_of_the_universe" title="wikilink">heat death</a> nor a <a href="Big_Crunch" title="wikilink">Big Crunch</a> after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the Universe density must have been within one part in 10<sup>14</sup> of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
<p>A resolution to this problem is offered by inflationary theory. During the inflationary period, spacetime expanded to such an extent that its <a href="curvature" class="uri" title="wikilink">curvature</a> would have been smoothed out. Thus, it is theorized that inflation drove the Universe to a very nearly spatially flat state, with almost exactly the critical density.</p>
<h3 id="magnetic-monopoles">Magnetic monopoles</h3>

<p>The magnetic monopole objection was raised in the late 1970s. <a href="Grand_unification_theory" title="wikilink">Grand unification theories</a> predicted <a href="topological_defect" title="wikilink">topological defects</a> in space that would manifest as <a href="magnetic_monopole" title="wikilink">magnetic monopoles</a>. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early Universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that searches have never found any monopoles. This problem is also resolved by <a href="cosmic_inflation" title="wikilink">cosmic inflation</a>, which removes all point defects from the observable Universe in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-future-according-to-the-big-bang-theory">The future according to the Big Bang theory</h2>

<p>Before observations of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the Universe. If the mass <a href="density" class="uri" title="wikilink">density</a> of the Universe were greater than the <a href="Critical_density_(cosmology)" title="wikilink">critical density</a>, then the Universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started&lt;U+2014&gt;a Big Crunch.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> Alternatively, if the density in the Universe were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out leaving <a href="white_dwarf" title="wikilink">white dwarfs</a>, <a href="neutron_star" title="wikilink">neutron stars</a>, and <a href="black_hole" title="wikilink">black holes</a>. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the Universe would asymptotically approach <a href="absolute_zero" title="wikilink">absolute zero</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;a <a href="Big_Freeze" title="wikilink">Big Freeze</a>. Moreover, if the proton were <a href="proton_decay" title="wikilink">unstable</a>, then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting <a href="Hawking_radiation" title="wikilink">Hawking radiation</a>. The <a href="entropy" class="uri" title="wikilink">entropy</a> of the Universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.</p>
<p>Modern observations of accelerating expansion imply that more and more of the currently visible Universe will pass beyond our <a href="event_horizon" title="wikilink">event horizon</a> and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The &lt;U+039B&gt;CDM model of the Universe contains dark energy in the form of a <a href="cosmological_constant" title="wikilink">cosmological constant</a>. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the Universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called <a href="phantom_energy" title="wikilink">phantom energy</a> theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called <a href="Big_Rip" title="wikilink">Big Rip</a>.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>

<p>While the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology, it is likely to be refined in the future. Little is known about the earliest moments of the Universe's history. The equations of classical general relativity indicate a singularity at the origin of cosmic time, although this conclusion depends on several assumptions. Moreover, general relativity must break down before the Universe reaches the <a href="Planck_temperature" title="wikilink">Planck temperature</a>, and a correct treatment of <a href="quantum_gravity" title="wikilink">quantum gravity</a> may avoid the would-be singularity.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
