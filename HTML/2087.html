<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The Faculty of Law (formerly known as the School of Administration and Law and the Faculty of Administration and Law) was founded in 1968. It began as a centre offering <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> external programmes, namely the <a href="LL.B" class="uri" title="wikilink">LL.B</a> (London-External) and the Chartered Institute of Secretaries (now <a href="Institute_of_Chartered_Secretaries_and_Administrators" title="wikilink">Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators</a>). The only internal programme offered then was the Diploma in Public Administration and Local Government<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In 1978 the LL.B (London-External) programme was discontinued and replaced by the Diploma in Law (DIL) programme. The DIL programme is equivalent to the LL.B programme offered in British Universities. It is a three-year academic degree course based on the structure of <a href="British_Universities" title="wikilink">British Universities</a> undergraduate law programmes. Unlike most of the British programmes however, the DIL programme at the faculty is conducted on a semester system. In 1982 the Faculty introduced a one-year Advance Diploma in Law (ADIL) programme whereby graduates of the DIL programme could advance their studies. The ADIL programme is a simulatory programmes designed to provide professional training for students in preparation for their career in the legal practice as Advocates and Solicitors.</p>
<p>Soon after, the faculty had renamed its programmes and DIL was renamed as the LL.B while ADIL became the LL.B (Hons.). The LL.B programme, however, has been replaced with the Bachelor of Legal Studies (Hons), which was introduced in 2002. Nevertheless, LL.B (Hons.) programme was retained and it still serve as the best programme for students who wish to practice law as <a href="Advocates" class="uri" title="wikilink">Advocates</a> and <a href="Solicitors" class="uri" title="wikilink">Solicitors</a>.</p>
<p>The delivery of the curriculum for this course adopts the method and strategy of simulated or experiential learning. The unique experience it provides to students in their legal training has led this programme to be widely recognized and accepted among the Malaysian legal fraternity. In 1995, the Faculty introduced the degree of Bachelor in Corporate Administration (Hons) (to train young and bright Bumiputras to hold office as Company Secretaries) and Bachelor of Administrative Science (Hons) in December 2002. In the pipeline are some new courses, namely, Bachelor of Law and Management (Hons) and Bachelor of Shariah and Law.</p>
