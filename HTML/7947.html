<p><strong>Socialist realism</strong> is a <a href="Teleology" title="wikilink">teleologically</a>-oriented style of <a href="realism_(arts)" title="wikilink">realistic art</a> which has as its purpose the furtherance of the goals of <a href="socialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">socialism</a> and <a href="communism" class="uri" title="wikilink">communism</a>. Although related, it should not be confused with <a href="social_realism" title="wikilink">social realism</a>, a type of art that realistically depicts subjects of social concern.</p>
<h2 id="socialist-realism-in-the-soviet-union">Socialist realism in the Soviet Union</h2>
<p>Socialist realism was the officially approved type of art in the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> for nearly sixty years. Communist doctrine decreed that all material goods and means of production belonged to the community as a whole. This included works of art and the means of producing art, which were also seen as powerful propaganda tools. During the <a href="October_Revolution" title="wikilink">October Revolution</a> of 1917, the <a href="Bolshevik" title="wikilink">Bolsheviks</a> established a movement called <a href="Proletkult" class="uri" title="wikilink">Proletkult</a> (the Proletarian Cultural and Enlightenment Organizations) which sought to put all arts into the service of the <a href="dictatorship_of_the_proletariat" title="wikilink">dictatorship of the proletariat</a>.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Soviet Union, Russian and Soviet artists embraced a wide variety of art forms under the auspices of Proletkult. Revolutionary politics and radical non-traditional art forms were seen as complementary. In art, <a href="Constructivism_(art)" title="wikilink">constructivism</a> flourished. In <a href="poetry" class="uri" title="wikilink">poetry</a>, the nontraditional and the <a href="avant-garde" class="uri" title="wikilink">avant-garde</a> were often praised.</p>
<p>This, however, aroused criticism from elements in the Communist party, who rejected modern styles such as <a href="impressionism" class="uri" title="wikilink">impressionism</a> and <a href="cubism" class="uri" title="wikilink">cubism</a>, since these movements existed before the revolution and hence were associated with &quot;decadent bourgeois art.&quot; Socialist realism was thus to some extent a reaction against the adoption of these &quot;decadent&quot; styles.</p>
<p><img src="Stalin_as_an_Organizer_of_the_October_Revolution.jpg" title="fig:&quot;Stalin as an Organiser of the October Revolution&quot; by Karp Trokhimenko" alt="&quot;Stalin as an Organiser of the October Revolution&quot; by Karp Trokhimenko" width="250" /> Socialist realism became state policy in <a href="1932" class="uri" title="wikilink">1932</a> when <a href="Stalin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stalin</a> promulgated the decree &quot;On the Reconstruction of Literary and Art Organizations&quot;. The <a href="Union_of_Soviet_Writers" title="wikilink">Union of Soviet Writers</a> was founded to control the output of authors, and the new policy was rubber-stamped at the Congress of Socialist Writers in <a href="1934" class="uri" title="wikilink">1934</a>. It was enforced ruthlessly in all spheres of artistic endeavour. Artists who strayed from the official line were severely punished – many were sent to the <a href="Gulag" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gulag</a> labour camps in <a href="Siberia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Siberia</a> and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The restrictions were loosened somewhat after Stalin's death in <a href="1953" class="uri" title="wikilink">1953</a> but the state still kept a tight rein on personal artistic expression. This caused many artists to chose to go into exile, for example the <a href="Odessa_Group" title="wikilink">Odessa Group</a> from the city of that name. Independently-minded artists that remained continued to experience the hostility of the state. In <a href="1974" class="uri" title="wikilink">1974</a>, for instance, a show of unofficial art in a field near Moscow was broken up, and the artworks destroyed, with water cannon and bulldozers (see <a href="Bulldozer_Exhibition" title="wikilink">Bulldozer Exhibition</a>). <a href="Mikhail_Gorbachev" title="wikilink">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>'s policy of <a href="glasnost" class="uri" title="wikilink">glasnost</a> and <a href="perestroika" class="uri" title="wikilink">perestroika</a> facilitated an explosion of interest in alternative art styles in the late <a href="1980s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1980s</a>, but socialist realism remained in force as the official state art style until as late as <a href="1991" class="uri" title="wikilink">1991</a>. It was not until after the <a href="fall_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">fall of the Soviet Union</a> that artists were finally freed from state censorship.</p>

<p>The Soviet Union exported socialist realism to virtually all of the other Communist countries, although the degree to which it was enforced there varied somewhat from country to country. It became the predominant art form across the Communist world for nearly fifty years.</p>
<p>Today, arguably the only country still focused on these aesthetic principles is <a href="North_Korea" title="wikilink">North Korea</a>. The <a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">People's Republic of China</a> occasionally reverts to socialist realism for specific purposes, such as idealised propaganda posters to promote the <a href="Chinese_space_program" title="wikilink">Chinese space program</a>.</p>
<p>Socialist realism had little mainstream impact in the non-Communist world, where it was widely seen as a totalitarian means of imposing state control on artists.</p>
<h2 id="roots-of-socialist-realism">Roots of socialist realism</h2>
<p>The political aspect of socialist realism was, in some respects, a continuation of pre-Soviet state policy. <a href="Censorship" class="uri" title="wikilink">Censorship</a> and attempts to control the content of art did not begin with the Soviets, but were a long-running feature of Russian life. The <a href="Tsar" title="wikilink">Tsarist</a> government also appreciated the potentially disruptive effect of art and required all books to be cleared by the censor. Writers and artists in <a href="19th_century" title="wikilink">19th century</a> <a href="Imperial_Russia" title="wikilink">Imperial Russia</a> became quite skilled at evading censorship by making their points without spelling it out in so many words. However, Soviet censors were not so easily evaded.</p>
<p>Socialist realism had its roots in <a href="neoclassicism" class="uri" title="wikilink">neoclassicism</a> and the traditions of realism in <a href="Russian_literature" title="wikilink">Russian literature</a> of the 19th century that described the life of simple people. It was exemplified by the aesthetic philosophy of <a href="Maxim_Gorki" title="wikilink">Maxim Gorki</a>. The work of the <a href="Peredvizhniki" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peredvizhniki</a> (&quot;Wanderers,&quot; a Russian <a href="realism_(arts)" title="wikilink">realist</a> movement of the late 19th / early 20th centuries), <a href="Jacques-Louis_David" title="wikilink">Jacques-Louis David</a> and <a href="Ilya_Yefimovich_Repin" title="wikilink">Ilya Yefimovich Repin</a> were notable influences.</p>
<h2 id="characteristics-of-socialist-realism">Characteristics of socialist realism</h2>
<p><img src="Socrealizm.jpg" title="fig:Socialist-Realist allegories surrounding the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw" alt="Socialist-Realist allegories surrounding the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw" width="150" /> Socialist realism held that successful art depicts and glorifies the proletariat's struggle toward socialist progress. The Statute of the Union of Soviet Writers in 1934 stated that socialist realism</p>
<dl>

<dd><em>is the basic method of Soviet literature and literary criticism. It demands of the artist the truthful, historically concrete representation of reality in its revolutionary development. Moreover, the truthfulness and historical concreteness of the artistic representation of reality must be linked with the task of ideological transformation and education of workers in the spirit of socialism.</em>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Its purpose was to elevate the common worker, whether factory or agricultural, by presenting his life, work, and recreation as admirable. In other words, its goal was to educate the people in the goals and meaning of Communism. The ultimate aim was to create what Lenin called &quot;an entirely new type of human being&quot;: <em><a href="New_Soviet_man" title="wikilink">New Soviet Man</a></em>. Stalin described the practitioners of socialist realism as &quot;engineers of souls&quot;.</p>
<p>The &quot;realism&quot; part is important. Soviet art at this time aimed to depict the worker as he truly was, carrying his tools. In a sense, the movement mirrors the course of American and Western art, where the everyday human being became the subject of the novel, the play, poetry, and art. The proletariat was at the center of communist ideals; hence, his life was a worthy subject for study. This was an important shift away from the aristocratic art produced under the Russian <a href="tsar" title="wikilink">tsars</a> of previous centuries, but had much in common with the late-19th century fashion for depicting the social life of the common people.</p>
<p><img src="Wladimir_Gawriilowitsch_Krikhatzkij_-_The_First_Tractor.jpg" title="fig:The First Tractor by Vladimir Krikhatsky" alt="The First Tractor by Vladimir Krikhatsky" width="250" /> Compared to the eclectic variety of 20th century Western art, socialist realism often resulted in a fairly bland and predictable range of artistic products (indeed, Western critics wryly described the principles of socialist realism as &quot;Girl meets Tractor&quot;). Painters would depict happy, muscular peasants and workers in factories and collective farms; during the Stalin period, they also produced numerous heroic portraits of the dictator to serve his <a href="cult_of_personality" title="wikilink">cult of personality</a>. Industrial and agricultural landscapes were popular subjects, glorifying the achievements of the Soviet economy. Novelists were expected to produce uplifting stories in a manner consistent with the Marxist doctrine of <a href="dialectical_materialism" title="wikilink">dialectical materialism</a>. Composers were to produce rousing, vivid music that reflected the life and struggles of the proletariat.</p>
<p>Socialist realism thus demanded close adherence to party doctrine, and has often been criticized as detrimental to the creation of true, unfettered art – or as being little more than a means to censor artistic expression. <a href="Czes&lt;U+0142&gt;aw_Mi&lt;U+0142&gt;osz" title="wikilink">Czes&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Mi&lt;U+0142&gt;osz</a>, writing in the introduction to Sinyavsky's <em>On Socialist Realism</em>, describes the products of socialist realism as &quot;inferior&quot;, ascribing this as necessarily proceeding from the limited view of reality permitted to creative artists.</p>
<p>Not all Marxists accepted the necessity of socialist realism. Its establishment as state doctrine in the 1930s had rather more to do with internal Communist Party politics than classic Marxist imperatives. The <a href="Hungary" title="wikilink">Hungarian</a> Marxist essayist <a href="Georg_Luk&lt;U+00E1&gt;cs" title="wikilink">Georg Luk&lt;U+00E1&gt;cs</a> criticized the rigidity of socialist realism, proposing his own &quot;critical realism&quot; as an alternative. However, such critical voices were a rarity until the 1980s.</p>
<h2 id="notable-works-and-artists-of-socialist-realism">Notable works and artists of socialist realism</h2>
<p>Maxim Gorky's novel <em><a href="Mother_(novel)" title="wikilink">Mother</a></em> is usually considered to have been the first work of socialist realism. Gorky was also a major factor in the school's rapid rise, and his pamphlet, <em>On Socialist Realism</em>, essentially lays out the needs of Soviet art. Other important works of literature include <a href="Fyodor_Gladkov" title="wikilink">Fyodor Gladkov</a>'s <em>Cement</em> (<a href="1925" class="uri" title="wikilink">1925</a>) and <a href="Mikhail_Sholokhov" title="wikilink">Mikhail Sholokhov</a>'s two volume epic, <em><a href="And_Quiet_Flows_the_Don" title="wikilink">And Quiet Flows the Don</a></em> (<a href="1934" class="uri" title="wikilink">1934</a>) and <em><a href="The_Don_Flows_Home_to_Sea" title="wikilink">The Don Flows Home to Sea</a></em> (<a href="1940" class="uri" title="wikilink">1940</a>).</p>
<p>The painter <a href="Aleksandr_Deineka" title="wikilink">Aleksandr Deineka</a> provides a notable example for his expressionist and patriotic scenes of the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, collective farms, and sports. <a href="Yuri_Pimenov" title="wikilink">Yuri Pimenov</a>, <a href="Boris_Ioganson" title="wikilink">Boris Ioganson</a> and <a href="Geli_Korzev" title="wikilink">Geli Korzev</a> have also been described as &quot;unappreciated masters of twentieth-century realism&quot;. <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0425/is_4_58/ai_59552693">1</a></p>
<h2 id="consequences-of-socialist-realism">Consequences of socialist realism</h2>
<p><img src="Waw-soviet-military-cemetery-relief.jpg" title="fig:A relief from the Soviet military cemetery in Warsaw showing workers greeting victorious soldiers." alt="A relief from the Soviet military cemetery in Warsaw showing workers greeting victorious soldiers." width="250" /> Socialist realism's rigid precepts and enforcement inevitably caused great damage to the freedom of Soviet artists to express themselves. Many artists and authors found their works censored, ignored, or rejected. <a href="Mikhail_Bulgakov" title="wikilink">Mikhail Bulgakov</a>, for instance, was forced to write his masterwork, <em><a href="The_Master_and_Margarita" title="wikilink">The Master and Margarita</a></em>, in secret, despite earlier successes such as <em>White Guard</em>. <a href="Sergey_Prokofiev" title="wikilink">Sergey Prokofiev</a> found himself essentially unable to compose <a href="music" class="uri" title="wikilink">music</a> during this period.</p>
<p>The political doctrine behind socialist realism also underlay the pervasive censorship of Communist societies. Apart from obvious political considerations that saw works such as those of <a href="George_Orwell" title="wikilink">George Orwell</a> being banned, access to foreign art and literature was also restricted on aesthetic grounds. Bourgeois art and all forms of experimentalism and formalism were denounced as decadent, degenerate and pessimistic, and therefore anti-Communist in principle. The works of <a href="James_Joyce" title="wikilink">James Joyce</a> were particularly harshly condemned. The net effect was that it was not until the 1980s that the general public in the Communist countries were able to freely access many works of Western art and literature. Many then joined Western observers in denouncing socialist realism as mere <a href="kitsch" class="uri" title="wikilink">kitsch</a> or <a href="propaganda" class="uri" title="wikilink">propaganda</a>.</p>
<p>The <em><a href="Sots_Art" title="wikilink">Sots Art</a></em> paintings of <a href="Komar_and_Melamid" title="wikilink">Komar and Melamid</a> can be viewed as a remarkable <a href="parody" class="uri" title="wikilink">parody</a> of socialist realism.</p>
