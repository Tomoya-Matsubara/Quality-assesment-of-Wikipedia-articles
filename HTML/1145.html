<p><strong><em>Bedsitcom</em></strong> is a British <a href="reality_television" title="wikilink">reality television</a> series that was broadcast on <a href="Channel_4" title="wikilink">Channel 4</a> in December 2003. Pitched as &quot;somewhere between a sitcom and a reality TV show&quot;,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> the show documented the lives of six young people living in a <a href="Apartment" title="wikilink">loft flat</a> in London. Its <a href="Narrative_hook" title="wikilink">hook</a> was that its TV audience was aware that three of the participants&lt;U+2014&gt;named Mel, Paul and Rufus&lt;U+2014&gt;were actually actors being directed by a trio of &quot;writers&quot; in a garage on the ground floor.</p>
<p><em>Bedsitcom</em> was commissioned by the <a href="Channel_Four_Television_Corporation" title="wikilink">Channel Four Television Corporation</a> and produced by <a href="Objective_Productions" title="wikilink">Objective Productions</a>. Producers auditioned thousands of people to be the show's genuine contestants and selected from them six young adults to live in the flat with the three actors. These six contestants were told that they would be starring in a new reality TV series called <em>Making Friends</em>, and featured on the show three at a time over a period of eight weeks. The programme ran for a single series of eight episodes and featured various storylines, involving dead goldfish, dodgy dealings, promiscuous mothers and telephone psychics.</p>
<p>The show received largely negative feedback from television reviewers, who criticised the show's premise as a &quot;deeply offensive&quot; idea.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It received a viewership peak of 1.2 million with its final episode, giving it an audience share of 8.9 per cent. <em>Bedsitcom</em> was not recommissioned for a second series and is currently not available either on DVD on Channel 4's <a href="Video_on_demand" title="wikilink">on demand</a> service, <a href="4oD" class="uri" title="wikilink">4oD</a>.</p>

<h3 id="concept">Concept</h3>
<p><em>Bedsitcom</em> was conceived as a parody of both reality television and the traditional <a href="sitcom" class="uri" title="wikilink">sitcom</a>,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and was created by <a href="Peter_James_(writer)" title="wikilink">Peter James</a> and <a href="Andrew_O&#39;Connor_(actor)" title="wikilink">Andrew O'Connor</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <em>Bedsitcom</em> combined these two elements by featuring three members of the public being unknowingly placed in extraordinary situations by three actors being directed by writers.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> After being commissioned for <a href="Channel_4" title="wikilink">Channel 4</a> by Danielle Lux, <em>Bedsitcom</em> was produced by Matt Crook and Kirsty Smith of <a href="Objective_Productions" title="wikilink">Objective Productions</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The show was pitched as &quot;somewhere between a sitcom and a reality TV show&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and was promoted as &quot;an entirely new genre of television programme&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Its title is a <a href="portmanteau" class="uri" title="wikilink">portmanteau</a> of the words &quot;<a href="bedsit" class="uri" title="wikilink">bedsit</a>&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;a British term referring to a form of rented accommodation consisting of a single room and shared bathroom&lt;U+2014&gt;and &quot;sitcom&quot;. The title is technically a <a href="misnomer" class="uri" title="wikilink">misnomer</a>: as the accommodation's bedroom and sitting area were separate, it was not a bedsit.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="casting">Casting</h3>
<p><img src="Bedsitcomcast1.jpg" title="fig:The first generation of cast in Bedsitcom. From left to right: Paul, Rufus, Bob, Shirine, Dave and Mel." alt="The first generation of cast in Bedsitcom.

O'Connor described the entire process as &quot;exhausting&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>To find suitable candidates to live with the three actors, producers auditioned roughly 10,000 people, who were told that they would be taking part in a new reality television programme in London called <em>Making Friends</em>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Six members of the public, named Barrington, Bob, Dave, David, Jessica and Shirine, were selected to feature on the show.</p>
<h3 id="writing-and-filming">Writing and filming</h3>
<p>The plots for <em>Bedsitcom</em> were devised by a team of writers located in a garage on the ground floor of the apartment building that the contestants were staying in. The writers would often appear on screen and explain to the TV audience what their intention for each episode was. They communicated with Ash, Gibbon and Jones either by ringing them on their mobile phones, or by calling them downstairs to speak to them in person.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The writers would occasionally change their plans for an episode&lt;U+2014&gt;in &quot;Worst Case Scenario&quot;, for example, the writers altered their storyline from having Mel bring various animals into the flat to having the group kill Mel's goldfish after only one night.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Among the team of writers were <a href="Jesse_Armstrong" title="wikilink">Jesse Armstrong</a> and <a href="Sam_Bain" title="wikilink">Sam Bain</a>, who had created the Channel 4 sitcom <em><a href="Peep_Show_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Peep Show</a></em> with O'Connor earlier that year.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Filming of <em>Bedsitcom</em> began in May 2003 and lasted for approximately eight weeks.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The flatmates were filmed for 12 hours a day, with this footage then being edited down to roughly 25 minutes per week of filming.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

After Bob jokingly asks for a thousand cigarettes and an expensive jacket, the flatmates are surprised when Terry delivers the goods. Shirine finds the entire situation particularly unbelievable and begins to question everything that has occurred in the flat during their time living there. The writers realise that the she is close to discovering the true nature of the show, so inform the group through one of the producers that three of them are actors. The writers try to suggest that Dave has starred in the film <em><a href="24_Hour_Party_People" title="wikilink">24 Hour Party People</a></em>, and Rufus (actor) accuses Bob of being an actor.

During the meal, Rufus cannot bring himself to tell his secret, forcing David to do it for him.
