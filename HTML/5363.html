<h3 id="resignation-from-politics">Resignation from politics</h3>
<p>On 8 February 2010, he announced his resignation from Fine Gael and from D&lt;U+00E1&gt;il &lt;U+00C9&gt;ireann, due to having &quot;virtually no influence or input&quot; into shaping Fine Gael's economic policies at a time of economic upheaval.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> It emerged that on 2 February, Lee met with the Fine Gael leader, <a href="Enda_Kenny" title="wikilink">Enda Kenny</a> and told him of his intention to resign. Kenny then offered Lee the frontbench position as spokesman on economic planning. Speaking to reporters outside <a href="Leinster_House" title="wikilink">Leinster House</a> soon after his announcement, Lee said it would have been dishonest of him to accept the position: &quot;I had absolutely no input for nine months. I think I had to be honest with myself and honest with the electorate about that and not pretend.&quot; Asked if his resignation was a vote of no confidence in Kenny, Lee said there were &quot;certainly lots of large mutterings at the moment in relation to the leader's position&quot;. He said he had &quot;minimal involvement&quot; with Fine Gael finance spokesman <a href="Richard_Bruton" title="wikilink">Richard Bruton</a>. &quot;I had a maximum of two or three conversations with Richard Bruton in a total nine months period. I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t know how my relationship is with [him]&quot; Lee said.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Kenny noted Lee had been appointed chair of the party's committee on economic policy and also its forum. &quot;I had anticipated a very important role for [George Lee] in the coming period with Fine Gael.&quot; Kenny's spokesman later dismissed the proposition that the resignation had implications for his leadership. He cited the public endorsement of Kenny by 20 D&lt;U+00E1&gt;il deputies over the course of the weekend.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Former Fine Gael leader <a href="Michael_Noonan" title="wikilink">Michael Noonan</a> said he was surprised at the decision: &quot;I thought that George Lee was fitting in well&quot;, adding that he believed he would have been a cabinet member in a Fine Gael led government.</p>
<p>George Lee was criticised after his resignation by Senator <a href="Eoghan_Harris" title="wikilink">Eoghan Harris</a>, who was speaking on the <em>Lunchtime</em> programme of <a href="Newstalk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newstalk</a> Radio. Harris suggested financial considerations and long working hours of politicians were the reasons why Lee resigned.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Fine Gael TD <a href="Brian_Hayes_(politician)" title="wikilink">Brian Hayes</a>, who was Lee's campaign manager in the Dublin South by-election, said that in discussions with Lee, the latter had complained about &quot;a major reduction in his income&quot; since leaving RT&lt;U+00C9&gt; to become a D&lt;U+00E1&gt;il backbencher. Lee denied that financial considerations had anything to do with his decision to quit politics.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>RT&lt;U+00C9&gt; received a letter from Lee confirming his intentions to return after his leave of absence.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The <em><a href="Sunday_Tribune" title="wikilink">Sunday Tribune</a></em> said on 14 February 2010 that he will have to wait for three months before returning to RT&lt;U+00C9&gt;.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
