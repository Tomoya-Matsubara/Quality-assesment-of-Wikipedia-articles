Mulder is able to escape from the camp while taking Krycek hostage, although the two become separated in the confusion. Krycek is found by a group of men whose left arms have all been amputated, and has his arm forcibly severed to prevent his involvements in <a href="Colonist_(The_X-Files)#Black_oil" title="wikilink">black oil</a> vaccination tests.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Vasily Peskow (<a href="Jan_Rubes" title="wikilink">Jan Rubes</a>), a former <a href="KGB" class="uri" title="wikilink">KGB</a> agent, has come out of retirement and traveled to America. While there, he assassinates Bonita Charne-Sayre, a doctor working for the <a href="Syndicate_(The_X-Files)" title="wikilink">Syndicate</a> to develop a black oil vaccine. From here, Peskow tracks down Charne-Sayre's test subjects, testing a Russian vaccine on them before killing them to cover his tracks.</p>
<p>Mulder has been able to return to America with the help of a group of Russian peasants, and rejoins his partner <a href="Dana_Scully" title="wikilink">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian_Anderson" title="wikilink">Gillian Anderson</a>).

The agents attempt to track down Peskow, following the trail of murders. However, the assassin is able to outwit the agents, and destroys the last of the oil-containing rocks seen in the previous episode in an oil-well explosion. He returns to Russia, where it is revealed that he had been hired for this task by Krycek.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Writing for <a href="The_A.V._Club" title="wikilink">The A.V. Club</a>, Zack Handlen rated the episode a B-, finding that it contained too much &quot;vamping for time&quot;, without enough focus on any of the individual plot threads. Handlen felt that the plot thread based on the murder of the <a href="Well-Manicured_Man" title="wikilink">Well-Manicured Man</a>'s doctor friend should have been the episode's focus, and derided the &quot;pomposity&quot; of the dialogue elsewhere in the episode.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Based on an advance viewing of the episode's script, <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> rated &quot;Terma&quot; an A-, praising the &quot;arms race&quot; plotline.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book <em>Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium &amp; The Lone Gunmen</em>, rated &quot;Terma&quot; one star out of five, comparing it unfavourably with the previous episode. Shearman and Pearson described the episode as &quot;awful&quot;, noting that there &quot;is virtually no structure to it at all&quot;. The episode's dialogue was described as being &quot;dreadful, boring and facile&quot;, with its long, clumsy lines and &quot;ever more complex and ever less interesting&quot; speeches.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
