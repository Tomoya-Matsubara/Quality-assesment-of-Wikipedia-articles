Brazilian politicians first moved to address this imbalance in 1904 as part of an overarching goal of becoming an international power. Three small battleships were ordered in late 1905, but after the appearance of the revolutionary British warship <a href="Her_Majesty&#39;s_Ship" title="wikilink">HMS</a>  in 1906, the Brazilian government canceled all three in favor of the new &quot;dreadnought&quot; type.{{#tag:ref|<em>cf.</em> <a href="Pre-dreadnought_battleship#Obsolescence" title="wikilink">&quot;Obsolescence&quot;</a> in <a href="Pre-dreadnought_battleship" title="wikilink">Pre-dreadnought battleship</a>.|group=upper-alpha}} Hulls for two <a href="Minas_Geraes-class_battleship" title="wikilink"><em>Minas Geraes</em>-class</a> ships were <a href="keel_laying" title="wikilink">laid down</a> with a third to follow.</p>
<p>The Argentine and Chilean governments immediately canceled a pact limiting their navies, and each ordered two dreadnoughts (the <a href="Rivadavia-class_battleship" title="wikilink"><em>Rivadavia</em></a> and <a href="Almirante_Latorre-class_battleship" title="wikilink"><em>Almirante Latorre</em> classes</a>, respectively). Meanwhile, Brazil's third dreadnought, <em>Rio de Janeiro</em>, was canceled in favor of an even larger ship, which was laid down and ripped up several times after repeated alterations to the design. When the Brazilian government finally settled on a design, they realized it would be outclassed by larger <a href="super-dreadnought" title="wikilink">super-dreadnoughts</a> then being built, so they sold the ship to the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a> and attempted to acquire a more powerful vessel.</p>
<p>The Brazilian government ordered one super-dreadnought from Armstrong, but the beginning of the <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">First World War</a> caused shipbuilders in the United Kingdom to suspend work on foreign warships, effectively canceling the ship. The war also caused the United Kingdom to purchase the two Chilean battleships before they were delivered, but Argentina's two dreadnoughts, built in the United States, were handed over in 1915. In the <a href="Interwar_period" title="wikilink">years after the war</a>, many naval expansion plans, some involving dreadnought purchases, were proposed. While most never came to fruition, in April 1920 the Chilean government reacquired one of the dreadnoughts taken over by the United Kingdom. No other dreadnoughts were purchased by a South American nation, and all were sold for <a href="ship_breaking" title="wikilink">scrap</a> in the 1950s.</p>

<p>Conflicting Argentine and Chilean claims to <a href="Patagonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Patagonia</a>, the southernmost region in South America, had been causing tension between the two countries since the 1840s. This tension was heightened in 1872 and 1878, when Chilean warships seized merchant ships which had been licensed to operate in the disputed area by the Argentine government. An Argentine warship did the same to a Chilean-licensed American ship in 1877. These actions nearly led to war in November 1878, when the Argentines dispatched a squadron of warships to the <a href="Santa_Cruz_River_(Argentina)" title="wikilink">Santa Cruz River</a>. The Chilean Navy responded in kind, and war was only avoided by a hastily signed treaty. Each government were distracted in the next few years, Argentina's with <a href="Conquest_of_the_Desert" title="wikilink">internal military operations against the indigenous population</a>, and Chile's with the <a href="War_of_the_Pacific" title="wikilink">War of the Pacific</a> (<em>Guerra del Pac&lt;U+00ED&gt;fico</em>) against Bolivia and Peru. Still, a full-fledged naval <a href="arms_race" title="wikilink">arms race</a> was underway between Argentina and Chile by 1890.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

In 1887, the Chilean government added <a href="Pound_sterling" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00A3&gt;</a>3,129,500 to the budget for its fleet, which was centered around two aging <a href="central_battery_ship" title="wikilink">central battery</a> <a href="ironclad_warship" title="wikilink">ironclads</a>,  and , and a <a href="protected_cruiser" title="wikilink">protected cruiser</a>. They ordered the battleship , two protected cruisers, and two <a href="torpedo_boat" title="wikilink">torpedo boats</a>; their <a href="keel_laying" title="wikilink">keels were laid</a> in 1890. The Argentine government quickly responded with an order for two battleships,  and . The race continued through the 1890s, even after the expensive 1891 <a href="Chilean_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Chilean Civil War</a>. The two countries alternated cruiser orders between 1890 and 1895, each ship marking a small increase in capabilities from the previous one. Argentina escalated the race in July 1895 by buying an <a href="armored_cruiser" title="wikilink">armored cruiser</a>, , from Italy. Chile responded by ordering its own armored cruiser, , and six torpedo boats; the Argentine government quickly ordered another cruiser from Italy and later bought two more.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The race slowed for a few years after <a href="Puna_de_Atacama_dispute" title="wikilink">a boundary dispute in the Puna de Atacama</a> region was successfully mediated in 1899 by the <a href="United_States_Ambassador_to_Argentina" title="wikilink">American ambassador to Argentina</a>, <a href="William_Paine_Lord" title="wikilink">William Paine Lord</a>, but more ships were ordered by both countries in 1901. The Argentine Navy ordered two <a href="Kasuga_class_cruiser" title="wikilink"><em>Rivadavia</em>-class</a> armored cruisers from Italy, and the Chilean Navy replied with orders for two <a href="Swiftsure_class_battleship" title="wikilink"><em>Constituci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</em>-class</a> <a href="pre-dreadnought" class="uri" title="wikilink">pre-dreadnought</a> battleships. The Argentines replied by signing letters of intent with the Italian engineering company <a href="Gio._Ansaldo_&amp;_C." title="wikilink">Ansaldo</a> in May 1901 to buy two larger battleships. The growing dispute disturbed members of the British government, as war looked like a very real possibility, and an armed conflict would disrupt the extensive British commercial interests in the area.{{#tag:ref|For example, the United Kingdom imported large amounts of Argentine grain—most of it shipped through the <a href="River_Plate" title="wikilink">River Plate</a>—and Chilean nitrates.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>|group=upper-alpha}} Through their minister to Chile, they mediated negotiations between the two countries. These <a href="Cordillera_of_the_Andes_Boundary_Case_1902" title="wikilink">were successfully concluded</a> on 28 May 1902 with three pacts. The third limited the naval armaments of both countries; both were barred from acquiring any further warships for five years without giving the other eighteen months' advance notice.

In mid-July and September 1908, the Commons discussed purchasing the ships to bolster the Royal Navy and ensure they would not be sold to a foreign rival, which would disrupt the British naval plan set in place by the &quot;<a href="Naval_Defence_Act_1889" title="wikilink">Two-power Standard</a>&quot;, though in March and late July 1908, the Brazilian government officially denied any sale was planned.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> In March 1909, the British press and House of Commons began pushing for more dreadnoughts after the <a href="First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty" title="wikilink">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>, <a href="Reginald_McKenna" title="wikilink">Reginald McKenna</a>, asserted that Germany had stepped up its building schedule and would complete thirteen dreadnoughts in 1911&lt;U+2014&gt;four more than previously estimated.

In June 1908, he presented a plan to the Congress where the Argentines wold offer the Brazilian government a chance to give one of their two dreadnoughts then building to Argentina to maintain naval parity between the two countries. Should they have refused, the Argentine government would have given their Brazilian counterparts an ultimatum: if in eight days they did not comply, the mobilized Argentine Army would invade what Zeballos claimed was an defenseless Rio de Janeiro. Unfortunately for Zeballos, the plans were leaked to the media; the public outcry from details first published in the newspaper <em><a href="La_Naci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" title="wikilink">La Naci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</a></em> were enough to halt the plan and ensure Zeballos' resignation.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|The end of Zeballos' tenure as Foreign Minister was extremely contentious, as another controversy closely linked to him began shortly after his resignation. In Zeballos' last days as minister, a now-famous Telegram no. 9, sent from the Brazilian government to their representatives in Chile, was intercepted by the Argentine government and decoded. It was read in a congressional session a day after Zeballos' departure, where the new Minister of Foreign Affairs claimed it was proof of intended Brazilian aggression against Argentina. The full contents of the telegram were released by Zeballos to the press, which kindled international disenchantment with Brazil. However, in a public relations coup, Rio Branco released the <a href="cipher" class="uri" title="wikilink">cipher</a> and actual full contents of the wrongly decoded telegram, proving it contained no reference to belligerent Brazilian intents on Argentina. Zeballos was later accused of deliberately distorting or forging the telegram. Whatever his culpability, his actions in that June may have been motivated by a personal vendetta against Rio Branco, who had bested Zeballos on several occasions since 1875, most notably during a border dispute arbitrated by American President Grover Cleveland (the <a href="Question_of_Palms" title="wikilink">Question of Palms</a>, or <em>Quest&lt;U+00E3&gt;o de Palmas</em>).<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a>|group=upper-alpha}}</p>

The acquisition of dreadnoughts to maintain an equal footing with Brazil would, in the words of the Argentine admiral in charge of overseeing the Argentine dreadnoughts while under construction, avoid a &quot;preponderance of power on the other side, where a sudden gust of popular feeling or injured pride might make [a blockade] a dangerous weapon against us.&quot;<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

In the second inquiry it may be presumed that everything that was good in the first proposals had been seized upon by the Argentine authorities and asked for in the new design.

<h2 id="third-stage-another-brazilian-dreadnought">Third stage: another Brazilian dreadnought</h2>

<p>After the first Brazilian dreadnought, <em>Minas Geraes</em>, was launched, the Brazilian government began an extended campaign to remove the third dreadnought from the contract due to political&lt;U+2014&gt;relations with Argentina were warming&lt;U+2014&gt;and economic reasons. After much negotiating and attempts from Armstrong to hold the Brazilian government to the contract, the Brazilians relented, due in part to lower bond rates that made it possible for the government to borrow the necessary money. <em>Rio de Janeiro</em> was laid for the first time in March 1910.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
<p>By May, the Brazilian government asked Armstrong to stop work on the new warship and to submit new designs which took in the most recent advance in naval technology, <a href="super-dreadnought" title="wikilink">super-dreadnoughts</a>. <a href="Sir_Eustace_Tennyson-d&#39;Eyncourt,_1st_Baronet" title="wikilink">Eustace Tennyson-d'Eyncourt</a> served as Armstrong's liaison to Brazil. Originally, the dreadnought was going to mount twelve 14-inch guns, but the many requests made by the Brazilian Navy for minor changes delayed the contract signing until 10 October 1910. The battleship's keel laying was delayed further by a <a href="Labor_unrest" title="wikilink">labor dispute</a> with the <a href="Worshipful_Company_of_Shipwrights" title="wikilink">Worshipful Company of Shipwrights</a>, which led to a <a href="Lockout_(industry)" title="wikilink">lockout</a>. During these delays, a new Minister of the Navy, Admiral <a href="Marques_Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o" title="wikilink">Marques Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o</a>, was appointed to replace de Alencar&lt;U+2014&gt;an important development, as the contract stipulated that the design could only proceed with the approval of the new Minister. Again, however, the Brazilian Navy found itself torn between two schools of thought: Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o and others in the navy favored a reversion to the 12-inch gun, but others, led by the outgoing Minister of the Navy (de Alencar) and the head of the Brazilian naval commission in the United Kingdom (Rear Admiral <a href="Duarte_Huet_de_Bacellar_Pinto_Guedes" title="wikilink">Duarte Huet de Bacellar Pinto Guedes</a>), were strongly in favor of obtaining the ship with the largest armament&lt;U+2014&gt;in this case, a design drawn up by Bacellar, carrying eight 16-inch guns, six 9.4-inch guns, and fourteen 6-inch guns.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a></p>

Armstrong evidently thought the second faction would prevail, so he also took with him everything needed to close a deal on Bacellar's design. By mid-March, Armstrong's contacts in Brazil reported that Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o had convinced the President to cancel the design with twelve 14-inch guns in favor of a smaller ship.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> The credit may not have laid with Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o alone, though. By March 1911, the Brazilian president was dealing with the aftermath of a large naval revolt in November 1910 (the <a href="Revolt_of_the_Lash" title="wikilink">Revolt of the Lash</a>)&lt;U+2014&gt;led by crewmen on the two new <em>Minas Geraes</em>-class dreadnoughts his navy had just purchased&lt;U+2014&gt;and worsening <a href="government_debt" title="wikilink">government debt</a> compounded by <a href="Government_budget_deficit" title="wikilink">budget deficits</a>. Brazil's external and internal debt would reach $500 and $335 million (respectively) by 1913, partly through rising deficits—$22 million in 1908, continuing to $47 million by 1912.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a><a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> In May, he commented negatively on the new ship:</p>

<p><span style="font-size:90%">When I assumed office, I found that my predecessor had signed a contract for the building of the battleship <em>Rio de Janeiro</em>, a vessel of 32,000 tons, with an armament of 14 in. guns. Considerations of every kind pointed to the inconvenience of acquiring such a vessel and to the revision of the contract in the sense of reducing the tonnage. This was done, and we shall possess a powerful unit which will not be built on exaggerated lines such as have not as yet stood the time of experience. (President <a href="Hermes_da_Fonseca" title="wikilink">Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca</a>, 3 May 1911, in Robert Scheina, <em>Latin America: A Naval History, 1810&lt;U+2013&gt;1987</em> [Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1987], 354)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>D'Eyncourt probably avoided proposing any design with 16-inch guns when he saw the political situation. In meetings with Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o, designs of only ten 12-inch guns mounted on the centerline were quickly rejected, even though their broadside was as strong as that of the <em>Minas Geraes</em> class, but a design with no less than <em>fourteen</em> 12-inch guns emerged as the frontrunner. Author David Topliss attributes this to political necessity, as he believed the Minister of the Navy could not validate purchasing a seemingly less-powerful dreadnought than the <em>Minas Geraes</em> class: with larger guns ruled out, the only remaining choice was a larger number of guns.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
<p>After numerous requests for design alterations from the Brazilian Navy were accommodated or rejected, a contract was signed for a ship with fourteen 12-inch guns on 3 June 1911 for &lt;U+00A3&gt;2,675,000, and <em>Rio de Janeiro</em>{{'}}s keel was laid for the fourth time on 14 September. It did not take long for the Brazilian government to reconsider their decision again;<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> by mid-1912, battleships with 14-inch guns were under construction, and suddenly it seemed that <em>Rio de Janeiro</em> would be outclassed upon completion.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> Making matters worse, a European depression after the end of the <a href="Second_Balkan_War" title="wikilink">Second Balkan War</a> in August 1913 reduced Brazil's ability to obtain foreign loans.

The price of coffee declined by 20% and Brazilian exports of it dropped 12.5% between 1912 and 1913; rubber saw a similar decline of 25 and 36.6%, respectively.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<p>Armstrong studied whether replacing the 12-inch guns with seven 15-inch guns would be feasible, but Brazil was probably already attempting to sell the ship. In the tension building up to the First World War, plenty of countries, including Russia, Italy, France, Greek, and the Ottoman Empire, were willing to purchase the ship. Russia and Italy dropped out, and Greece made an offer for the original purchase price plus an additional &lt;U+00A3&gt;50,000. As they worked to obtain the money, the Ottomans, with a loan from a French banker independent of his government, were able to secure the ship as-is for &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,200,000 on 29 December 1913. As part of the purchase contract, the remainder of the ship was constructed with Ottoman money. Renamed <em>Sultan Osman I</em>, she was eventually taken over by the British shortly after the beginning of the First World War, serving with the Royal Navy as <a href="HMS_Agincourt_(1913)" title="wikilink">HMS <em>Agincourt</em></a>.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>

<p>After selling <em>Rio de Janeiro</em>, the Brazilian government asked Armstrong and Vickers to prepare more designs for a new battleship. They replied with at least fourteen designs, six from Vickers (December 1913 through March 1914) and eight from Armstrong (February 1914). Vickers' designs varied between eight and ten 15-inch and eight 16-inch guns, with speeds between 22 and 25 knots (the lower-end ships having mixed firing, the higher using oil), and displacements between  and . Armstrong took two basic designs, one with eight and the other with ten 15-inch guns, and varied their speed and firing.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|Topliss (1985), in writing a design history of the four Brazilian dreadnoughts, makes no mention of Vanterpool's (1969) article, which detailed four substantially different designs prepared in October 1913 by Armstrong.

<h3 id="attempted-sales">Attempted sales</h3>
<p>After <em>Rio de Janeiro</em> was sold to the Ottoman Empire, the Argentine government bowed to popular demand and began to seek a buyer for their two dreadnoughts. The money received in return would be devoted to internal improvements. Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the <a href="Argentine_National_Congress" title="wikilink">Argentine National Congress</a> in mid-1914, but all were defeated. Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Ottoman, Italian, and Grecian governments were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of <em>Rio de Janeiro</em>.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a><a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a><a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> The <em>New-York Tribune</em> reported that the Argentine government rejected a $17.5 million offer for <em>Moreno</em> alone, which would have netted them a large profit over the original construction cost of the ships ($12 million).<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> The United States, worried that its neutrality would not be respected and its technology would be released for study to a foreign country, put diplomatic pressure on the Argentine government to keep the ships, which it eventually did.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>
<p>In each of the countries involved in the South American dreadnought arms race, movements arose that advocated the sale of the dreadnoughts to devote the money toward more worthy pursuits.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> The costs for the ships were rightfully viewed as enormous.

<h3 id="post-war-expansions">Post-war expansions</h3>
<p>After the First World War, the dreadnought race never resumed, but many plans for post-war naval expansions and improvements were attempted by the Argentine, Brazilian, and Chilean governments. As part of an overall scheme to regain naval superiority in the region, the Argentines sent <em>Rivadavia</em> and <em>Moreno</em> to the United States in 1924 and 1926 to be modernized. Also, a large naval building program in support of this goal was launched in 1926, three cruisers (the Italian-built <a href="Veinticinco_de_Mayo_class_cruiser" title="wikilink"><em>Veinticinco de Mayo</em> class</a> and the British-built <a href="ARA_La_Argentina" title="wikilink">''La Argentina</a>), twelve destroyers (the Spanish-built <a href="Churruca_class_destroyer" title="wikilink"><em>Churruca</em> class</a> and the British-built <a href="Mendoza_class_destroyer" title="wikilink"><em>Mendoza</em></a>/<a href="Buenos_Aires_class_destroyer" title="wikilink"><em>Buenos Aires</em></a> classes), and three submarines (the Italian-built <a href="Santa_Fe_class_submarine" title="wikilink"><em>Santa Fe</em> class</a>) were acquired.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a></p>

In 1924, a proposal for the construction of a relatively modest number of warships (a heavy cruiser, and five destroyers) and five submarines was floated. In the same year, the newly arrived American naval mission, led by Rear Admiral <a href="Carl_Theodore_Vogelgesang" title="wikilink">Carl Theodore Vogelgesang</a>, tendered a naval expansion plan of 151,000 tons, divided between battleships (70,000), cruisers (60,000), destroyers (15,000), and submarines (6,000).

<p>At the beginning of the Second World War, the three major South American navies found themselves unable to acquire major warships. With the end, the United States and United Kingdom had many ships that were unnecessary or surplus to the requirements of their post-war navies. Still, the South American countries ran into political difficulties in acquiring anything larger than <a href="Flower_class_corvette" title="wikilink"><em>Flower</em>-class corvettes</a> and <a href="River_class_frigate" title="wikilink"><em>River</em>-class frigates</a>. The war had proved the obsolete status of battleships, so the navies were seeking cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, which they were finally able to acquire when the <a href="Red_Scare" title="wikilink">Red Scare</a> began to strongly affect American and international politics. One of the deals reached under the <a href="Mutual_Defense_Assistance_Act" title="wikilink">Mutual Defense Assistance Act</a> (1949) sold six American light cruisers to Argentina, Brazil, and Chile in January 1951.{{#tag:ref|Most of the cruisers transferred were from the <a href="Brooklyn_class_cruiser" title="wikilink"><em>Brooklyn</em> class</a>, but one of Brazil's cruisers (<a href="USS_St._Louis_(CL-49)" title="wikilink"><em>Almirante Tamandar&lt;U+00E9&gt;</em></a>) was from the slightly improved <a href="St._Louis_class_cruiser_(1938)" title="wikilink"><em>St. Louis</em> class</a>.|group=upper-alpha}} While this bolstered the navies of important South American allies of the United States, which would be <a href="Inter-American_Treaty_of_Reciprocal_Assistance" title="wikilink">treaty-bound</a> to assist the United States in any war, naval historian Robert Scheina argues that the American government also used the opportunity to significantly affect the traditional naval rivalry among the three countries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size:90%;">While more than ninety percent of the aid provided under [the Mutual Defense Assistance Act] went to European and Asian countries, the United States, now the dominant foreign power in Latin America, used surplus ships as a tool to further mutual interests ... and reshape the Latin American naval panorama. Thus Argentina's pre-World War II formula that she had to possess a fleet equal in strength to the combined fleets of Brazil and Chile changed in one stroke to 1A = 1B = 1C. (Robert Scheina, <em>Latin America: A Naval History, 1810&lt;U+2013&gt;1987</em> [Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1987], 173)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the influx of relatively modern warships, the battleships of the three countries were sold for <a href="ship_breaking" title="wikilink">scrap</a> in the 1950s. The Brazilian ships were disposed of first; <em>S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo</em> was sold in 1951, and was lost in a storm north of the <a href="Azores" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azores</a> while being towed to her final destination.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a><a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> <em>Minas Geraes</em> was sold two years later and broken up in <a href="Genoa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Genoa</a> beginning in 1954.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> Of the Argentine dreadnoughts, <em>Rivadavia</em> was scrapped in Italy beginning in 1959, while <em>Moreno</em> was brought to Japan in 1957.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> <em>Almirante Latorre</em>, inactive since 1951, followed <em>Moreno</em> to Japan in 1959.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a><a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Minas_Geraes_from_bow.jpg" title="fig:Minas Geraes seen from the bow; the wing turrets are on either side of the superstructure" alt="Minas Geraes seen from the bow; the wing turrets are on either side of the superstructure" /> The <a href="historiography" class="uri" title="wikilink">historiography</a>, or works published on a specific topic, behind the South American dreadnought race is relatively small in number and coverage, especially in English. General maritime histories on the period (c. 1904&lt;U+2013&gt;14) avoid the area and focus on the traditional powers, especially the <a href="World_War_I_naval_arms_race" title="wikilink">Anglo-German arms race</a>. The more specific English-language works on the period that do cover South America tend to summarize the region's dreadnought race, focus on the ships built rather than their implications, or look at the closely related <a href="Revolt_of_the_Lash" title="wikilink">Revolt of the Lash</a> (<em>Revolta da Chibata</em>). Seward Livermore, writing from <a href="Brown_University" title="wikilink">Brown University</a>, looked at the race about thirty years after its conclusion from an American perspective. This meant he gave emphasis to the Argentine order, the role of the American government in obtaining it, and the attempts to obtain the Chilean order. Livermore was mildly critical of the arms race for its destabilizing effects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size:90%;">As a means of promoting closer cooperation or understanding between the two hemispheres the international armament business was of very dubious worth. The peddling of war material to small but quarrelsome nations was fraught with too many unpleasant and unpredictable consequences. Battleship diplomacy had been a novel departure in American statecraft; some material success had been achieved, but the net result, from the standpoint of the imponderable factors, was most unsatisfactorily disappointing. (Seward Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy in South America: 1905&lt;U+2013&gt;1925,&quot; <em>Journal of Modern History</em> 16, no. 1 (1944): 48)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>British maritime historian <a href="Richard_Hough" title="wikilink">Richard Hough</a>, writing in 1966, remarked on the huge cost of the warships and expressed disbelief that the countries thought they could afford the ships in the first place, let alone maintain them as the years went by. He also wondered as to the original purpose of Brazil's ships, as in his view the relations between Brazil and its naval rivals, Argentina and Chile, were quite good given prior context. As Hough saw the situation, the only ones to gain from the whole arms race were the armament companies involved in the ships' construction.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a></p>
<p>Robert Scheina, a Latin American naval historian, devoted a chapter of his 1987 book, <em>Latin America: A Naval History, 1810&lt;U+2013&gt;1987</em>, to the dreadnought race. Although this was one of the first comprehensive works on the topic of Latin American maritime history, it was criticized by some reviewers for trying to fit too much information into too short a space.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a><a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a> This shows in the dreadnought race's coverage, which was dwarfed by more recent events, especially the <a href="Falklands_War" title="wikilink">Falklands War</a> (seven pages versus fifty-five).<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> Still, Scheina included a small conclusion to the chapter, where he outlined 'lessons' learned by the three countries in the dreadnought race. Like Hough, he highlighted the exorbitant maintenance costs of the dreadnoughts. In addition, they were meant to be used against other dreadnoughts, but as soon as the traditional powers built dreadnoughts in large numbers, the ones owned by Argentina, Brazil, and Chile were much less of a threat. Last, Scheina pointed out the benefits of international attention, in the form of military alliances, brought by the dreadnoughts, but also noted that this resulted in the same outcome as lesson two&lt;U+2014&gt;as the years went on, the ships dwindled in importance.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a></p>
<p>Brazilian historian Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Roberto Martins Filho utilized British and Brazilian archival material to focus on the Brazilian dreadnoughts in his Portuguese-language book, <em>A Marinha Brasileira na Era dos Encoura&lt;U+00E7&gt;ados, 1895&lt;U+2013&gt;1910</em>, or <em>The Brazilian Navy in the Era of Dreadnoughts</em>. He took a very different approach and demonstrated that the Brazilian Navy was not ready for the disruptive influence of modern vessels. By focusing on acquiring the powerful new dreadnoughts, rather than adequately training the huge amounts of manpower needed to crew the ships—a third of the entire navy—or the maintenance necessary to keep the dreadnoughts operational, the navy was without the ability to conduct serious operations soon after their delivery.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a><a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a><a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> In addition, he proposes that the dreadnoughts' modern conditions were not compatible with the liberal use of corporal punishment, which provided a crucial spark to the Revolt against the Lash.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a></p>
