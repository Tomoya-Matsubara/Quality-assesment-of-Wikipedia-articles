<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Maria Sharapova was born on April 19, 1987 in <a href="Nyagan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nyagan</a>, Soviet Union. Her parents, Yuri and Elena, are from <a href="Gomel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gomel</a>, <a href="Belarus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belarus</a>. Concerned about the regional effects of the 1986 <a href="Chernobyl_disaster" title="wikilink">Chernobyl nuclear accident</a>, they left their homeland shortly before Sharapova was born.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> When Sharapova was two, the family moved to <a href="Sochi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sochi</a>. There her father befriended Aleksandr Kafelnikov, whose son <a href="Yevgeny_Kafelnikov" title="wikilink">Yevgeny</a> would go on to win two Grand Slam singles titles and become Russia's first world no. 1 ranked tennis player. Aleksandr gave Sharapova her first tennis racquet at the age of four, whereupon she began practicing regularly with her father at a local park.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> She took her first tennis lessons with veteran Russian coach Yuri Yutkin, who was instantly impressed when he saw her play, noting her &quot;exceptional <a href="hand-eye_coordination" title="wikilink">hand-eye coordination</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>At the age of six, Sharapova attended a tennis clinic in Moscow run by <a href="Martina_Navratilova" title="wikilink">Martina Navratilova</a>, who recommended professional training at the <a href="Nick_Bollettieri" title="wikilink">Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy</a> in Florida, which had previously trained players such as <a href="Andre_Agassi" title="wikilink">Andre Agassi</a>, <a href="Monica_Seles" title="wikilink">Monica Seles</a>, and <a href="Anna_Kournikova" title="wikilink">Anna Kournikova</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> With money tight, Yuri borrowed the sum that would enable him and his daughter, neither of whom could speak English, to travel to the United States, which they finally did in 1994.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Visa restrictions prevented Sharapova's mother from joining them for two years.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Arriving in Florida with savings of US$700,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Sharapova's father took various low-paying jobs, including dishwashing, to fund her lessons until she was old enough to be admitted to the academy. In 1995, she was signed by <a href="IMG_(business)" title="wikilink">IMG</a>, who agreed to pay the annual tuition fee of $35,000 for Sharapova to stay at the academy, allowing her to finally enroll at the age of 9.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

However, she was then beaten by eventual champion <a href="Venus_Williams" title="wikilink">Venus Williams</a>.</p>

<p><img src="Maria_Sharapova_at_the_2009_Wimbledon_Championships_12.jpg" title="fig:Sharapova at The Championships, Wimbledon in 2009." alt="Sharapova at The Championships, Wimbledon in 2009." /> Early in her career Sharapova's first and second serves were regarded as powerful,<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> and she was believed to possess one of the best deliveries on the Tour.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> Since the beginning of 2007, however, problems with her shoulder have reduced the effectiveness of her serve.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> The shoulder injury not only resulted in her inconsistent first serves, but also her hitting high numbers of double faults.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> Two-time US Open singles champion <a href="Tracy_Austin" title="wikilink">Tracy Austin</a> believes that Sharapova often loses confidence in the rest of her game when she experiences problems with her serve and consequently produces more unforced errors and generally plays more tentatively,<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> while tennis writer Joel Drucker remarked that her serve was the &quot;catalyst for her entire game&quot;, and that her struggles with it left her &quot;unmasked.&quot;<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<p>In her return from layoff in 2008 to 2009, she used an abbreviated motion, which was somewhat less powerful, and though producing aces also gave a very high number of double faults. After her early loss at the <a href="2009_US_Open_(tennis)" title="wikilink">2009 US Open</a>, Sharapova returned to a more elongated motion, similar to her pre-surgery serve. She has since been able to produce speeds greater than before, including a 121 mph serve hit at the Birmingham tournament in 2010 &lt;U+2013&gt; the fastest serve of her career.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<p>However since her shoulder operation Sharapova has been unable to control her serve. This has led to numerous faults, as she is unable to feel how much power she is generating.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> The new action led to an elbow injury, but under Thomas H&lt;U+00F6&gt;gstedt it has improved but can still be erratic.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> This improvement in serving can be seen in the 2013 Australian Open and following tournaments where Maria Sharapova committed little double faults as compared to previous years.</p>
<h3 id="surfaces">Surfaces</h3>
<p>Because she predicates her game on power, Sharapova's preferred surfaces are the fast-playing hard and grass courts, as evident through her 25 victories on hard court and grass court. This is most notable when she won the <a href="2004_Wimbledon" title="wikilink">2004 Wimbledon</a>, <a href="2006_US_Open_(tennis)" title="wikilink">2006 U.S. Open</a> and <a href="2008_Australian_Open" title="wikilink">2008 Australian Open</a> crowns, where she had her career breakthrough and played her peak tennis level, respectively.</p>
<p>Sharapova, however, is not as well-suited to the slower clay courts as she is on hard and grass courts. Sharapova has admitted that she is not as comfortable with her movement on clay compared with other court surfaces and once described herself as like a &quot;cow on ice&quot; after a match on clay,<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> due to her inability to slide. Despite this, she has shown improvement on this surface with respect to experience, as evident with her first WTA red clay title at the <a href="2010_Internationaux_de_Strasbourg" title="wikilink">2010 Internationaux de Strasbourg</a>, 7 years since playing on the WTA circuit. Less than a year later, she won her biggest red clay title at the Tier I <a href="2011_Internazionali_BNL_d&#39;Italia" title="wikilink">2011 Internazionali BNL d'Italia</a>. Sharapova is still showing rapid improvement on clay courts as evident by winning the <a href="2012_Porsche_Tennis_Grand_Prix" title="wikilink">2012 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix</a> in Stuttgart and then a month later successfully defending her 2011 title in Rome, by winning the <a href="2012_Internazionali_BNL_d&#39;Italia" title="wikilink">2012 Internazionali BNL d'Italia</a>, and then winning the <a href="2012_French_Open" title="wikilink">2012 French Open</a>, her best clay court season to date with a win/loss record of 19&lt;U+2013&gt;1, with a total loss of four sets the entire clay court season.</p>

Sharapova stated &quot;I'm sure when I was 17 years old and someone said, you'll be playing for another eight years, it would be like, you're not going to see me at a press conference at 25 years old. But years go on. I missed a year in my career&lt;U+2014&gt;I didn't play that year. I've said this, just before the tournament, a few weeks before, I woke up and I was just so happy to be going back on the court. I felt so fresh, full of energy, just with a really good perspective. Times change, obviously. I see myself playing this sport for many more years because it's something that gives me the most pleasure in my life. I think it helps when you know you're good at something, and you can always improve it.
