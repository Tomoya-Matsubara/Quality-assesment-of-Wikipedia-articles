<p>Paul has held a state-issued medical license since moving to Bowling Green in 1993.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> He received his first job from Dr. John Downing of Downing McPeak Vision Centers, which brought him to Bowling Green after completing his residency. Paul worked for Downing for about five years before parting ways. Afterwards, he went to work at the Gilbert Graves Clinic, a private medical group in Bowling Green, for 10 years before creating his own practice in a converted one-story house across the street from Downing's office.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> After his election to the U.S. Senate, he merged his practice with Downing's medical practice.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Paul has had two malpractice lawsuits filed against him since 1993; was cleared in one case and the other was settled for $50,000.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Regardless, his medical work has been praised by Downing and he has medical privileges at two Bowling Green hospitals.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Paul specializes in cataract and glaucoma surgeries, LASIK procedures, and corneal transplants.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1995, Paul passed the <a href="American_Board_of_Ophthalmology" title="wikilink">American Board of Ophthalmology</a> (ABO) boards on his first attempt and earned board-certification under the ABO for a decade. In 1997, to protest the ABO's decision to <a href="grandfather_clause" title="wikilink">grandfather</a> in older ophthalmologists and not require them to recertify, Paul, along with 200 ophthalmologists formed the National Board of Ophthalmology (NBO).<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Paul's ophthalmology board is not officially recognized by the <a href="American_Board_of_Medical_Specialties" title="wikilink">American Board of Medical Specialties</a> (ABMS).

Paul later recreated the board in September 2005, three months before his certification from the ABO was scheduled to expire. His ABO certification lapsed on December 31, 2005.

<h2 id="political-activism">Political activism</h2>
<p>As founder and chairman of the anti-tax organization Kentucky Taxpayers United (KTU) since 1994, Paul regularly presents &quot;taxpayers' friend&quot; awards to state legislators. KTU, which regards itself as <a href="nonpartisan" class="uri" title="wikilink">nonpartisan</a>, but is criticized for being ideologically <a href="Conservatism_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">conservative</a>,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> examines legislator records on taxation and spending to inform voters where their own lawmakers stand on the issues.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Paul's editorial commentary on behalf of KTU has been published and recognized in the <em><a href="Kentucky_Post" title="wikilink">Kentucky Post</a></em>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>In the beginning of 2009, Paul was the focus of an online grassroots movement to <a href="Draft_(politics)" title="wikilink">draft</a> him in a bid to replace beleaguered Republican Kentucky senator <a href="Jim_Bunning" title="wikilink">Jim Bunning</a>.

<p>On May 1, 2009, Paul officially confirmed that if Bunning, whose fundraising in 2009 has matched his poor numbers in opinion polling for the 2010 election,<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> declined to seek a third term, he would almost certainly run in the <a href="United_States_Republican_Party" title="wikilink">Republican Party</a> primary to succeed him,<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> and formed an <a href="exploratory_committee" title="wikilink">exploratory committee</a> soon after, while still promising to stay out of the race if Bunning had ultimately decided to run for re-election.
