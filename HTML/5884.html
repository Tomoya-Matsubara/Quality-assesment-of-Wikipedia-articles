<p>The <strong>Black Moon Clan</strong> is a <a href="fictional" class="uri" title="wikilink">fictional</a> <a href="clan" class="uri" title="wikilink">clan</a> existing in the <a href="30th_century" title="wikilink">30th century</a> in the <a href="Sailor_Moon" title="wikilink">Sailor Moon</a> <a href="metaseries" class="uri" title="wikilink">metaseries</a>. It comprises the <a href="antagonist" title="wikilink">antagonists</a> of the third story arc, called <em><a href="Sailor_Moon_R" title="wikilink">Sailor Moon R</a></em> in the anime and <em>Black Moon</em> in the manga.</p>
<p>Members of the Black Moon Clan come from <em>Planet Nemesis</em>, a fictional tenth planet of the <a href="Solar_System" title="wikilink">Solar System</a>. It is decribed as a planet of &quot;negative energy,&quot; having the ability to vanish from visual sight. Due to its negativity, it was claimed to be tracable by <a href="X-ray" title="wikilink">X-Rays</a>.</p>
<p>Powered by a mysterious fortuneteller named Wiseman and led by <a href="Prince_Demande" title="wikilink">Prince Demande</a>, the Black Moon Clan are those who refused to be purified by Queen Serenity's Phantom Silver Crystal and were exiled to Nemesis. <a href="Prince_Demande" title="wikilink">Prince Demande</a>, the <em><a href="de_jure" title="wikilink">de jure</a></em> leader of the Clan, wished to take revenge for his people, but was ignorant of Wiseman's true purpose. Wiseman eventually revealed himself to be the <a href="Death_Phantom" title="wikilink">Death Phantom</a>, a creature intent on using his Evil Black Crystal to open the Black Gate, eliminating all life in the world. His plan was to travel back into the <a href="20th_century" title="wikilink">20th century</a> and wipe out human civilization there, in the past. Demande and those who followed his orders were killed--only the <a href="Ayakashi_Sisters" title="wikilink">Ayakashi Sisters</a> survived, because they were willing to accept purification by <a href="Usagi_Tsukino" title="wikilink">Sailor Moon</a> and live as normal humans. Because of the <a href="Sailor_Senshi" title="wikilink">Sailor Senshi</a>, the battle in the past never came to fruition, and was eventually taken back into the 30th century.</p>
<h2 id="death-phantom">Death Phantom</h2>
<p><img src="Wiseman006.jpg" title="fig:Death Phantom as &quot;Wiseman&quot;" alt="Death Phantom as &quot;Wiseman&quot;" width="200" /> <strong>Death Phantom</strong> (romanized to <em>deefu fantom</em>), who calls himself <strong>Wiseman</strong>, is an eternally <a href="Immortality" title="wikilink">immortal</a> form of <a href="Chaos_(Sailor_Moon)" title="wikilink">Chaos</a> from the future. In the English version of the anime, he is called <strong>Doom Phantom</strong>.</p>
<p>In the manga, Death Phantom was originally a human who lived in the time of the future kingdom of Crystal Tokyo, and possessed dark powers which he used to wreak havoc upon the citizens of Crystal Tokyo. These were his death hands, able to reach insurmountable distances to attack people, and his evil vision, capable of controlling the minds of others by simply looking at them. He was banished to the barren tenth planet, Nemesis, by Neo-Queen Serenity. Over an unspecified period of time, Death Phantom managed to merge his spirit with the planet and became one with Nemesis. He cloaked his decayed and crumbling human body, and reached out psychically to earth in order to look for discontent. Thus the Black Moon Clan was born. Calling himself the Wiseman, Death Phantom lead their way into a near fatal attack on Crystal Tokyo, and then into the past of Sailor Moon's time in order to obtain the <a href="Mystical_Silver_Crystal" title="wikilink">Mystical Silver Crystal</a> and have his revenge.</p>
<p>Death Phantom cares little for his pawns; he manipulates them and sends the young traitors to their deaths, and even kills <a href="Crimson_Rubeus" title="wikilink">Rubeus</a> himself. When faced with a new conduit for power, in the form of <a href="Chibiusa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chibiusa</a>, he fills her with dark energy and she becomes his Black Lady. When Demande finally comes to his senses and blasts the Wiseman with all of his strength, the decayed body shatters; but Black Lady only laughs, before revealing that Wiseman <em>is</em> Nemesis. When all of his followers are gone, and Black Lady reverts to Sailor Chibi Moon, he creates a dark energy swirl to kill the <a href="Sailor_Senshi" title="wikilink">Sailor Senshi</a>, but they attack the planet and are able to destroy it.</p>
<p>In the anime, Death Phantom first approached Prince Demande when he was significantly younger. The Black Moon Clan were the descendants of traitors who had been exiled to Nemesis centuries before by Neo-Queen Serenity and King Endymion of Crystal Tokyo; and, posing as Wiseman, the Death Phantom manipulated them into gathering power for himself. He promised them that he could give them the power and ability to go to Earth and appeal directly to Neo-Queen Serenity to gain amnesty for the citizens of Nemesis, who had committed no crimes themselves. However, Wiseman's influence slowly warped the minds of his pawns until they carried out his plan for revenge and the ultimate destruction of the planet Earth. He also convinced them that the 30th century utopia of Crystal Tokyo was an abomination against nature, as all of its citizens were given immortality through the power of the <a href="Mystical_Silver_Crystal" title="wikilink">Mystical Silver Crystal</a>.</p>
<p>The Wiseman personally counsels Rubeus during his mission for a long time, but is all the same unconcerned about his death. He condescendingly humiliates <a href="Green_Esmeraude" title="wikilink">Esmeraude</a> when she comes to him asking to be the queen of Nemesis, and thus brings about her transformation into a hideous dragon and, ultimately, her death. He manipulates <a href="Chibiusa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chibiusa</a>'s childhood memories in order to make her into Black Lady, and kills <a href="Blue_Saphir" title="wikilink">Saphir</a> when the latter realizes that he and his brother have been lied to. In the end, Death Phantom is destroyed, but Nemesis and its inhabitants aren't; from Sailor Moon's promise to Prince Demande, we imagine they are given a better life.</p>
