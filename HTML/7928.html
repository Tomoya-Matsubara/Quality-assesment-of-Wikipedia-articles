<p><a href="image:2003-3d-hawaiian-islands-usgs-i2809.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|420px|3-D perspective view of the southeastern Hawaiian Islands, with the white summits of <a href="Mauna_Loa" title="wikilink">Mauna Loa</a> ( high) and <a href="Mauna_Kea" title="wikilink">Mauna Kea</a> ( high)</a> The 15 volcanoes that make up the 8 principal islands of <a href="Hawaii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hawaii</a> are the youngest in a chain of over 125 volcanoes that stretch  across the <a href="North_Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">North Pacific Ocean</a>, called the <a href="Hawaiian-Emperor_seamount_chain" title="wikilink">Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p><img src="Hawaii_hotspot.jpg" title="fig:The characteristic &quot;V&quot; shape, a separation between the older Emperor and newer Hawaiian sections, is easily visible in this satellite photograph|thumb" alt="The characteristic &quot;V&quot; shape, a separation between the older Emperor and newer Hawaiian sections, is easily visible in this satellite photograph|thumb" width="500" /> The chain is remarkable for its length and the number of volcanoes that comprise it. It is split into two subsections across a break, separating the older Emperor Seamount Chain from the younger Hawaiian Ridge; the &quot;V&quot; shape is easily noticeable in satellite photos.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The volcanoes are systematically younger as you move further southeast; the oldest dated volcano, located at the northern end, is 81 million years. The break between the two sub-chains is 43 million years- in comparison, the oldest of the principal islands, <a href="Kauai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kauai</a>, is little more than 5 million years.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The &quot;assembly line&quot; that forms the volcanoes is driven by a <a href="hot_spot" title="wikilink">hot spot</a>- a plume of lava deep within the Earth procuring magma at the surface. As the <a href="Pacific_Plate" title="wikilink">Pacific Plate</a> moves in a west-northwest direction, each volcano moves with it away from its place of origin above the hot spot. The age and orientation of the volcanoes are a record of the direction, rate of movement, and orientation of the <a href="Pacific_Plate" title="wikilink">Pacific Plate</a>. The pronounced 43 million year old break separating the Hawaiian Ridge from the Emperor Chain marks a dramatic change in direction of plate movement.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <img src="P&lt;U+0101&gt;hoehoe_and_Aa_flows_at_Hawaii.jpg" title="fig:Ropey, vesicular Pahoehoe (center) and bigger, blockier &#39;A&#39;a flow side by side" alt="Ropey, vesicular Pahoehoe (center) and bigger, blockier &#39;A&#39;a flow side by side" width="220" /> All of the volcanoes in the chain evolved through a sequence of stages. A typical pattern of activity is a steady rise early in the volcano's history, perhaps 500,000 years long, and then a sharp decline of activity as the volcano ages and moves away from its hotspot.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> However, it may take several million years for volcanism to stop entirely. Interestingly, as the eruption rate changes, so does the composition of its lava. A relationship between height above sea level and type of lava exists. Underwater volcanoes generally form charecteristic <a href="Lava#Pillow_lava" title="wikilink">Pillow lava</a>, so named for their shape, while near-water eruptions tend to be composed mainly of <a href="Ash" title="wikilink">ash</a>. Once the volcano is high enough so as to eliminate interference from water, its lava flows become those of ropey <a href="Pahoehoe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pahoehoe</a> flows and the blocky <a href="&#39;a&#39;a" title="wikilink">'A'a</a> lava.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="submarine-preshield-stage">Submarine preshield stage</h2>
<p><img src="Nur05018.jpg" title="fig:A photo of Pillow lava, the typical type of flow from submarine volcanoes." alt="A photo of Pillow lava, the typical type of flow from submarine volcanoes." width="180" /> <img src="Loihi_3d.gif" title="fig:Bathymetric rendering of Loihi, the only known Hawaiian volcano that is currently still in the Pre-Shield stage.|220px" alt="Bathymetric rendering of Loihi, the only known Hawaiian volcano that is currently still in the Pre-Shield stage.|220px" /> When a volcano is first born near the Hawaiian hotspot, it begins its growth in the submarine preshield stage, characterized by infrequent, typically low volume eruptions. The volcano is steep-sided, and it usually has a defined <a href="caldera" class="uri" title="wikilink">caldera</a> and has two or more <a href="rift_zone" title="wikilink">rift zones</a> radiating from the summit. The type of lava erupted in this stage of activity is <a href="Alkalic_basalt" title="wikilink">Alkalic basalt</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Because the eruptions occur with the volcano underwater, the form of lava typical to eruptions is <a href="Lava#Pillow_lava" title="wikilink">pillow lava</a>. Pillow lava is puffy, rounded lava that was given very little time to cool due to immediate exposure to water. Water pressure prevents the lava from exploding upon contact with the cold ocean water, forcing it to simmer and solidify quickly. This stage is thought to last about 200,000 years, but lavas erupted during this stage make up only a tiny fraction of the final volume of the volcano.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> As time progresses, eruptions become stronger and more frequent.</p>
<p>The only example of a Hawaiian volcano in this stage is <a href="Loihi_Seamount" title="wikilink">Lo&lt;U+2018&gt;ihi Seamount</a>, which is thought to be transitioning from the submarine preshield stage into the submarine phase of the shield stage. All older volcanoes have had their preshield stage lavas buried by younger lavas, so everything that is known about this stage comes from research done on Lo&lt;U+2018&gt;ihi Seamount.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="shield-stages">Shield stages</h2>
<p>The shield stage of the volcano is subdivided into three phases: the submarine, explosive, and sub aerial. During this stage of growth, the volcano accumulates about 95 percent of its mass and it takes on the &quot;shield&quot; shape that <a href="shield_volcano" title="wikilink">shield volcanoes</a> are named for. It is also the stage where the volcano's eruptive frequency reaches its peak.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="submarine-phase">Submarine phase</h3>
<p><img src="Basaltes_en_coussin_ALpes.JPG" title="fig:A large block of old Pillow lava, with a hammer for comparison.|thumb" alt="A large block of old Pillow lava, with a hammer for comparison.|thumb" width="220" /> <img src="Lava-explosion-kilauea.gif" title="fig:Lava explodes spectacularly on contact with the cold ocean water, one of the processes that builds Hawaiian volcanoes." alt="Lava explodes spectacularly on contact with the cold ocean water, one of the processes that builds Hawaiian volcanoes." width="220" /> As eruptions become more and more frequent at the end of the preshield stage, the composition of the lava erupted from the Hawaiian volcano changes from alkalic basalt to <a href="tholeiitic_basalt" title="wikilink">tholeiitic basalt</a> and the volcano enters the submarine phase of the shield stage. In this phase, the volcano continues to erupt pillow lava. Calderas form, fill, and reform at the volcano's summit and the rift zones remain prominent. The volcano builds its way up to sea level. The submarine phase ends when the volcano is only shallowly submerged.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The only example of a volcano in this stage is <a href="Loihi_Seamount" title="wikilink">Loihi Seamount</a>, which is currently transitioning into this phase from the preshield stage.</p>
<h3 id="explosive-phase">Explosive phase</h3>
<p><img src="Limu_o_Pele.jpg" title="fig:Lava bubbles explosively as it hits the cold water." alt="Lava bubbles explosively as it hits the cold water." width="220" /> This volcanic phase, so named for the explosive reactions with lava that take place, begins when the volcano just breaches the surface. The pressure and instantaneous cooling of being underwater evaporates, replaced instead by contact with water. Lava and seawater make contact, resulting in a lot of steam.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The change in environment also procures a change in lava type, and the lava from this stage is mostly ash. These explosive eruptions continue intermittently for several hundred thousand years.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Calderas continually develop and fill, and rift zones remain prominent. The phase ends when the volcano has sufficient mass and height (about 4,000 feet above sea level) that the interaction between sea water and erupting lava fade away.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="subaerial-phase">Subaerial phase</h3>
<p><img src="Aa_flow_from_Mauna_Loa.jpg" title="fig:&#39;A&#39;a lava flow from Mauna Loa, currently in the Subaerial phase, overruns nearby vegetation.|220px" alt="&#39;A&#39;a lava flow from Mauna Loa, currently in the Subaerial phase, overruns nearby vegetation.|220px" /> Once a volcano has put on enough mass and height to end frequent contact with water, the sub aerial substage begins. During this stage of activity, the explosive eruptions become much less frequent and the nature of the eruptions become much more gentle. Lava flows are a combination of <a href="pahoehoe" title="wikilink">p&lt;U+0101&gt;hoehoe</a> and <a href="Lava#&lt;U+2018&gt;a&lt;U+2018&gt;a" title="wikilink">&lt;U+2018&gt;a&lt;U+2018&gt;a</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> It is during this stage, arguably the best-studied, that the low-profile &quot;<a href="shield" class="uri" title="wikilink">shield</a>&quot; shape of Hawaiian volcanoes is formed, named for the shape of a warrior's shield.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Eruption rates and frequencies peak, and about 95% of the volcano's eventual volume forms during a period of roughly 500,000 years.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The lava erupted in this stage form flows of <a href="pahoehoe" title="wikilink">p&lt;U+0101&gt;hoehoe</a> or <a href="Lava#&lt;U+2018&gt;a&lt;U+2018&gt;a" title="wikilink">&lt;U+2018&gt;a&lt;U+2018&gt;a</a>. During this <a href="subaerial" class="uri" title="wikilink">subaerial</a> stage, the flanks of the growing volcanoes are unstable and as a result, large <a href="landslide" title="wikilink">landslides</a> may occur. At least 17 major landslides have occurred around the major Hawaiian islands. This stage is arguably the most well-studied, as all eruptions that occurred in the 20th century in <a href="Hawaii" title="wikilink">Hawai&lt;U+2018&gt;i</a> were produced by volcanoes in this phase.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Mauna_Loa" title="wikilink">Mauna Loa</a> and <a href="Kilauea" title="wikilink">K&lt;U+012B&gt;lauea</a> volcanoes are in this phase of activity.</p>
<h2 id="postshield-stage">Postshield stage</h2>
<figure>
<img src="Hualalai_from_north.jpg" title="The dark outline of Hualalai, showing the won and weathered shape of a volcano in the Post-shield stage.|thumb" alt="The dark outline of Hualalai, showing the won and weathered shape of a volcano in the Post-shield stage.|thumb" width="220" /><figcaption>The dark outline of <a href="Hualalai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hualalai</a>, showing the won and weathered shape of a volcano in the Post-shield stage.|thumb</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As the volcano reaches the end of the shield stage, the volcano goes through another series of changes as it enters the postshield stage. The type of lava erupted changes from tholeiitic basalt back to alkalic basalt and eruptions become slightly more explosive.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Eruptions in the postshield stage cap the volcano with a carapace of lava, containing low silica and high alkali contents, the reverse of the stage before it. Some Hawaiian volcanoes diverge from this, however. Lava flows are those of a lot of <a href="Cinder" title="wikilink">cinder</a> with stocky, pasty <a href="&#39;a&#39;a" title="wikilink">'A'a</a> flows.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Caldera development stops, and the rift zones become more and more inactive. The new lava flow raises the slope grade, as the <a href="&#39;a&#39;a" class="uri" title="wikilink">'a'a</a> never reaches the base. These lavas commonly fill and overflow the <a href="caldera" class="uri" title="wikilink">caldera</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Eruption rate gradually decreases over a period of around 250,000 years, eventually stopping altogether as the volcano goes <a href="dormant" class="uri" title="wikilink">dormant</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Mauna_Kea" title="wikilink">Mauna Kea</a>, <a href="Hualalai" title="wikilink">Hual&lt;U+0101&gt;lai</a>, and <a href="Haleakala" title="wikilink">Haleakal&lt;U+0101&gt;</a> volcanoes are in this stage of activity.</p>
<h2 id="erosional-stage">Erosional stage</h2>
<p>After the volcano becomes <a href="dormant" class="uri" title="wikilink">dormant</a>, the forces of <a href="erosion" class="uri" title="wikilink">erosion</a> gain control of the mountain. The volcano subsides into the oceanic <a href="Crust_(geology)" title="wikilink">crust</a> due to its immense weight and loses elevation. Meanwhile, rain also bites at the volcano, creating spectacular valleys. <a href="Coral_reef" title="wikilink">Coral reefs</a> grow along the shoreline. The volcano, altogether, becomes a skeleton of its former self.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Kohala_(mountain)" title="wikilink">Kohala</a>, <a href="Lanai" title="wikilink">L&lt;U+0101&gt;nai</a>, and <a href="Waianae_Range" title="wikilink">Wai&lt;U+2018&gt;anae</a> volcanoes are examples of volcanoes in this stage of development.</p>
<h2 id="rejuvenated-stage">Rejuvenated stage</h2>
<p>After a long period of dormancy and erosion of the surface, the volcano might become active again, entering a final stage of activity called the rejuvenated stage. During this stage, the volcano erupts small volumes of lava very infrequently. These eruptions are often spread out over several millions of years.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The composition of the lavas erupted in this stage are usually alkalic.</p>
<p><a href="Koolau_Range" title="wikilink">Ko&lt;U+2018&gt;olau</a> and <a href="West_Maui_Mountains" title="wikilink">West Maui</a> volcanoes are examples of volcanoes in this stage of development. Note, however, that because in this stage eruptions are very infrequent (occurring thousands or even tens of thousands of years apart), erosion is still the primary factor controlling the volcano at this point.</p>
<h2 id="coral-atoll-stage">Coral atoll stage</h2>
<p><img src="Coral_atoll_formation_animation.gif" title="fig:Right|An animated sequence showing the erosion of a volcano, and the formation of a coral reef around it-eventually resulting in an Atoll." alt="Right|An animated sequence showing the erosion of a volcano, and the formation of a coral reef around it-eventually resulting in an Atoll." width="400" /> Eventually, erosion and subsidence break the volcano down to sea level. At this point, the volcano becomes an <a href="atoll" class="uri" title="wikilink">atoll</a>, with a ring of <a href="coral" class="uri" title="wikilink">coral</a> and sand islands surrounding a <a href="lagoon" class="uri" title="wikilink">lagoon</a>. All the Hawaiian islands west of the <a href="Gardner_Pinnacles" title="wikilink">Gardner Pinnacles</a> in the <a href="Northwestern_Hawaiian_Islands" title="wikilink">Northwestern Hawaiian Islands</a> are in this stage.</p>
<h2 id="guyot-stage">Guyot stage</h2>
<p><img src="Guyot.jpg" title="fig:Bear Seamount, an example of a guyot (though not in the Hawaii-Emporer Chain). Note the flat top." alt="Bear Seamount, an example of a guyot (though not in the Hawaii-Emporer Chain). Note the flat top." width="220" /> Atolls are the product of the growth of tropical <a href="Marine_organism" title="wikilink">marine organisms</a>, so these <a href="Island" title="wikilink">islands</a> are only found in warm <a href="Tropical" title="wikilink">tropical waters</a>. Eventually, the <a href="Pacific_Plate" title="wikilink">Pacific Plate</a> carries the volcanic atoll into waters too cold for these marine organisms to maintain a reef by growth.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Volcanic islands located beyond the warm water temperature requirements of <a href="Reef" title="wikilink">reef building organisms</a> become seamounts as they subside and are eroded away at the surface. An island that is located where the ocean <a href="Temperature" title="wikilink">water temperatures</a> are just sufficiently warm for upward <a href="Reef" title="wikilink">reef growth</a> to keep pace with the rate of subsidence is said to be at the <a href="Atoll" title="wikilink">Darwin Point</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Islands more polar evolve towards seamounts or guyots; islands more equatorial evolve towards atolls (see <a href="Kure_Atoll" title="wikilink">Kure Atoll</a>).</p>
<p>After the reef dies, the volcano subsides or erodes below sea level and becomes a coral-capped seamount. These flat-topped seamounts are called <a href="guyot" title="wikilink">guyots</a>. Most, if not all, the volcanoes west of Kure Atoll as well as most, if not all, the volcanoes in the <a href="Emperor_Seamount" title="wikilink">Emperor Seamount</a> chain are guyots.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="other-patterns">Other patterns</h2>
<p>Not all Hawaiian volcanoes go through all the stages of activity described here. For example, <a href="Koolau_Range" title="wikilink">Ko&lt;U+2018&gt;olau Volcano</a> on <a href="Oahu" title="wikilink">O&lt;U+2018&gt;ahu</a>—which prehistorically was mostly destroyed by a cataclysmic <a href="landslide" class="uri" title="wikilink">landslide</a>—never went through the postshield stage and became dormant for hundreds of thousands of years after the shield stage before coming back to life for the rejuvenated stage of activity; some volcanoes apparently never rose above sea level; and there is no evidence to suggest that <a href="West_Molokai" title="wikilink">West Moloka&lt;U+2018&gt;i</a> volcano ever went through a rejuvenated stage, while its younger neighbors, <a href="Molokai" title="wikilink">East Moloka&lt;U+2018&gt;i</a> and <a href="Molokai" title="wikilink">West Maui</a> volcanoes, have evident rejuvenated lavas.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
