Some well-known forms of it were expressed in the 13th century by <a href="Thomas_Aquinas" title="wikilink">Thomas Aquinas</a> and in the 19th century by <a href="William_Paley" title="wikilink">William Paley</a>. Aquinas, in his <em><a href="Summa_Theologica" title="wikilink">Summa Theologiae</a></em>, used the concept of design in his &quot;fifth proof&quot; for God's existence.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In the early 19th century, Paley's argument from design in <em><a href="Natural_Theology_(Paley)" title="wikilink">Natural Theology</a></em> (1802), used the <a href="watchmaker_analogy" title="wikilink">watchmaker analogy</a>,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and such arguments led to the development of what was called <a href="natural_theology" title="wikilink">natural theology</a>, the study of nature as way of understanding &quot;the mind of God&quot;. This movement fueled the passion for collecting fossils and other biological specimens, which ultimately led to <a href="Charles_Darwin" title="wikilink">Charles Darwin</a>'s <em><a href="On_the_Origin_of_Species" title="wikilink">On the Origin of Species</a></em> (1859). Similar reasoning postulating a divine designer is embraced today by many believers in <a href="theistic_evolution" title="wikilink">theistic evolution</a>, who consider modern science and the theory of <a href="evolution" class="uri" title="wikilink">evolution</a> to be compatible with the concept of a supernatural designer. In correspondence about the question with <a href="Asa_Gray" title="wikilink">Asa Gray</a>, Darwin wrote that &quot;I cannot honestly go as far as you do about Design. I am conscious that I am in an utterly hopeless muddle.

<p>Intelligent design in the late 20th and early 21st century is a development of <a href="natural_theology" title="wikilink">natural theology</a> that seeks to change the basis of science and undermine evolutionary theory.<ref>See, e.g., the publisher's editorial description of the 2006 paperback printing of <a href="William_Paley" title="wikilink">William Paley</a> (1803) ''Natural Theology&quot; : &quot;William Paley's classic brings depth to the history of intelligent design arguments. The contrivance of the eye, the ear, and numerous other anatomical features throughout the natural world are presented as arguments for God's presence and concern. While there are distinctive differences between Paley's argument and those used today by intelligent design theorists and creationists, it remains a fascinating glimpse of the nineteenth-century's debate over the roles of religion and science&quot;.</p>

<p>Philosopher <a href="Barbara_Forrest" title="wikilink">Barbara Forrest</a> writes that the intelligent design movement began in 1984 with the publication by Jon A.

Thaxton</a>, a chemist and creationist. Thaxton held a conference in 1988, &quot;Sources of Information Content in DNA,&quot; which attracted creationists such as <a href="Stephen_C._Meyer" title="wikilink">Stephen C. Meyer</a>. Forrest writes that, in December 1988, Thaxton decided to use the term &quot;intelligent design,&quot; instead of creationism, for the movement.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>In March 1986 a review by Meyer used information theory to suggest that messages transmitted by DNA in the cell show &quot;specified complexity&quot; specified by intelligence, and must have originated with an intelligent agent.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In November of that year Thaxton described his reasoning as a more sophisticated form of Paley's argument from design.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> At the <em>Sources of Information Content in DNA</em> conference in 1988 he said that his intelligent cause view was compatible with both <a href="metaphysical_naturalism" title="wikilink">metaphysical naturalism</a> and supernaturalism,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="MichaelBehe.jpg" title="fig:The concept of irreducible complexity was popularised by Michael Behe, in his 1996 book, Darwin&#39;s Black Box." alt="The concept of irreducible complexity was popularised by Michael Behe, in his 1996 book, Darwin&#39;s Black Box." /> The term &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; was introduced by biochemist <a href="Michael_Behe" title="wikilink">Michael Behe</a> in his 1996 book <em><a href="Darwin&#39;s_Black_Box" title="wikilink">Darwin's Black Box</a></em>, though he had already described the concept in his contributions to the 1993 revised edition of <em>Of Pandas and People</em>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Behe defines it as &quot;a single system which is composed of several well-matched interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning&quot;.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>Behe uses the analogy of a mousetrap to illustrate this concept. A mousetrap consists of several interacting pieces&lt;U+2014&gt;the base, the catch, the spring and the hammer&lt;U+2014&gt;all of which must be in place for the mousetrap to work. Removal of any one piece destroys the function of the mousetrap. Intelligent design advocates assert that natural selection could not create irreducibly complex systems, because the selectable function is present only when all parts are assembled. Behe argued that irreducibly complex biological mechanisms include the bacterial flagellum of <em><a href="E._coli" title="wikilink">E. coli</a></em>, the blood clotting cascade, <a href="cilia" class="uri" title="wikilink">cilia</a>, and the adaptive <a href="immune_system" title="wikilink">immune system</a>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Critics point out that the irreducible complexity argument assumes that the necessary parts of a system have always been necessary and therefore could not have been added sequentially.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> They argue that something which is at first merely advantageous can later become necessary as other components change. Furthermore, they argue, evolution often proceeds by altering preexisting parts or by removing them from a system, rather than by adding them. This is sometimes called the &quot;scaffolding objection&quot; by an analogy with scaffolding, which can support an &quot;irreducibly complex&quot; building until it is complete and able to stand on its own.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Behe has acknowledged using &quot;sloppy prose&quot;, and that his &quot;argument against Darwinism does not add up to a logical proof&quot;.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Irreducible complexity has remained a popular argument among advocates of intelligent design; in the <a href="Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District" title="wikilink">Dover trial</a>, the court held that &quot;Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large&quot;.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="specified-complexity">Specified complexity</h3>

<p>In 1986 the creationist chemist <a href="Charles_Thaxton" title="wikilink">Charles Thaxton</a> used the term &quot;specified complexity&quot; from <a href="information_theory" title="wikilink">information theory</a> when claiming that messages transmitted by DNA in the cell were specified by intelligence, and must have originated with an intelligent agent.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> The intelligent design concept of &quot;specified complexity&quot; was developed in the 1990s by mathematician, philosopher, and theologian <a href="William_Dembski" title="wikilink">William Dembski</a>. Dembski states that when something exhibits specified complexity (i.e., is both complex and &quot;specified&quot;, simultaneously), one can infer that it was produced by an intelligent cause (i.e., that it was designed) rather than being the result of natural processes. He provides the following examples: &quot;A single letter of the alphabet is specified without being complex. A long sentence of random letters is complex without being specified. A <a href="Shakespearean" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shakespearean</a> <a href="sonnet" class="uri" title="wikilink">sonnet</a> is both complex and specified&quot;.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> He states that details of living things can be similarly characterized, especially the &quot;patterns&quot; of molecular sequences in functional biological molecules such as <a href="DNA" class="uri" title="wikilink">DNA</a>.</p>
<p><img src="Dembski_head_shot.jpg" title="fig:William Dembski proposed the concept of specified complexity." alt="William Dembski proposed the concept of specified complexity." width="140" /> Dembski defines <a href="complex_specified_information" title="wikilink">complex specified information</a> (CSI) as anything with a less than 1 in 10<sup>150</sup> chance of occurring by (natural) chance. Critics say that this renders the argument a <a href="Tautology_(rhetoric)" title="wikilink">tautology</a>: complex specified information cannot occur naturally because Dembski has defined it thus, so the real question becomes whether or not CSI actually exists in nature.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>The conceptual soundness of Dembski's specified complexity/CSI argument has been widely discredited by the scientific and mathematical communities.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Specified complexity has yet to be shown to have wide applications in other fields as Dembski asserts. John Wilkins and <a href="Wesley_R._Elsberry" title="wikilink">Wesley Elsberry</a> characterize Dembski's &quot;explanatory filter&quot; as <em>eliminative</em>, because it eliminates explanations sequentially: first regularity, then chance, finally defaulting to design. They argue that this procedure is flawed as a model for scientific inference because the asymmetric way it treats the different possible explanations renders it prone to making false conclusions.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Richard_Dawkins" title="wikilink">Richard Dawkins</a>, another critic of intelligent design, argues in <em><a href="The_God_Delusion" title="wikilink">The God Delusion</a></em> that allowing for an intelligent designer to account for unlikely complexity only postpones the problem, as such a designer would need to be at least as complex.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Other scientists have argued that evolution through selection is better able to explain the observed complexity, as is evident from the use of selective evolution to design certain electronic, aeronautic and automotive systems which are considered problems too complex for human &quot;intelligent designers&quot;.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="fine-tuned-universe">Fine-tuned Universe</h3>

<p>Intelligent design proponents have also occasionally appealed to broader teleological arguments outside of biology, most notably an argument based on the <a href="Fine-tuned_universe" title="wikilink">fine-tuning of universal constants</a> that make matter and life possible and which are argued not to be solely attributable to chance. These include the values of <a href="fundamental_physical_constants" title="wikilink">fundamental physical constants</a>, the relative strength of <a href="nuclear_force" title="wikilink">nuclear forces</a>, <a href="electromagnetism" class="uri" title="wikilink">electromagnetism</a>, and <a href="gravity" class="uri" title="wikilink">gravity</a> between <a href="fundamental_particles" title="wikilink">fundamental particles</a>, as well as the ratios of masses of such particles. Intelligent design proponent and <a href="Center_for_Science_and_Culture" title="wikilink">Center for Science and Culture</a> fellow <a href="Guillermo_Gonzalez_(astronomer)" title="wikilink">Guillermo Gonzalez</a> argues that if any of these values were even slightly different, the universe would be dramatically different, making it impossible for many <a href="chemical_elements" title="wikilink">chemical elements</a> and features of the <a href="Universe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Universe</a>, such as <a href="galaxies" class="uri" title="wikilink">galaxies</a>, to form.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Thus, proponents argue, an intelligent designer of life was needed to ensure that the requisite features were present to achieve that particular outcome.</p>
<p>Scientists have generally responded that this argument cannot be tested and is therefore not science but metaphysics. Some scientists argue that even when taken as mere speculation, these arguments are poorly supported by existing evidence.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> <a href="Victor_J._Stenger" title="wikilink">Victor J. Stenger</a> and other critics say both intelligent design and the <a href="Weak_anthropic_principle" title="wikilink">weak form</a> of the <a href="anthropic_principle" title="wikilink">anthropic principle</a> are essentially a <a href="Tautology_(logic)" title="wikilink">tautology</a>; in his view, these arguments amount to the claim that life is able to exist because the Universe is able to support life.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The claim of the improbability of a life-supporting universe has also been criticized as an <a href="argument_by_lack_of_imagination" title="wikilink">argument by lack of imagination</a> for assuming no other forms of life are possible. Life as we know it might not exist if things were different, but a different sort of life might exist in its place. A number of critics also suggest that many of the stated variables appear to be interconnected and that calculations made by mathematicians and physicists suggest that the emergence of a universe similar to ours is quite probable.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>Proponent <a href="Granville_Sewell" title="wikilink">Granville Sewell</a> argues that the evolution of complex forms of life represents a decrease of <a href="entropy" class="uri" title="wikilink">entropy</a>, and that it thus violates the <a href="second_law_of_thermodynamics" title="wikilink">second law of thermodynamics</a> and so supports intelligent design.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> This, however, is a misapplication of <a href="thermodynamic" class="uri" title="wikilink">thermodynamic</a> principles.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> The second law applies to closed systems only. If Granville's argument were valid, living things could not be born and grow, as this also would be a decrease in entropy. Neither evolution nor the growth of living things violates the second law of thermodynamics because living things are not closed systems&lt;U+2014&gt;they have external energy sources (e.g. food, oxygen, sunlight) whose production requires an offsetting net increase in entropy.</p>
<h3 id="intelligent-designer">Intelligent designer</h3>

<p>Intelligent design arguments are formulated in secular terms and intentionally avoid identifying the intelligent agent (or agents) they posit. Although they do not state that God is the designer, the designer is often implicitly hypothesized to have intervened in a way that only a god could intervene. Dembski, in <em><a href="The_Design_Inference" title="wikilink">The Design Inference</a></em>, speculates that an alien culture could fulfill these requirements. The authoritative description of intelligent design,<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> however, explicitly states that the <em>Universe</em> displays features of having been designed. Acknowledging the <a href="paradox" class="uri" title="wikilink">paradox</a>, Dembski concludes that &quot;no intelligent agent who is strictly physical could have presided over the origin of the universe or the origin of life&quot;.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The leading proponents have made statements to their supporters that they believe the designer to be the <a href="God_in_Christianity" title="wikilink">Christian God</a>, to the exclusion of all other religions.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>Beyond the debate over whether intelligent design is scientific, a number of critics argue that existing evidence makes the design hypothesis appear unlikely, irrespective of its status in the world of science. For example, <a href="Jerry_Coyne" title="wikilink">Jerry Coyne</a> asks why a designer would &quot;give us a pathway for making <a href="vitamin_C" title="wikilink">vitamin C</a>, but then destroy it by disabling one of its enzymes&quot; (see <a href="pseudogene" class="uri" title="wikilink">pseudogene</a>) and why he or she would not &quot;stock oceanic islands with reptiles, mammals, amphibians, and freshwater fish, despite the suitability of such islands for these species&quot;. Coyne also points to the fact that &quot;the flora and fauna on those islands resemble that of the nearest mainland, even when the environments are very different&quot; as evidence that species were not placed there by a designer.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Previously, in <em><a href="Darwin&#39;s_Black_Box" title="wikilink">Darwin's Black Box</a></em>, Behe had argued that we are simply incapable of understanding the designer's motives, so such questions cannot be answered definitively. Odd designs could, for example, &quot;have been placed there by the designer ... for artistic reasons, to show off, for some as-yet undetectable practical purpose, or for some unguessable reason&quot;. Coyne responds that in light of the evidence, &quot;either life resulted not from intelligent design, but from evolution; or the intelligent designer is a cosmic prankster who designed everything to make it look as though it had evolved&quot;.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>Asserting the need for a designer of complexity also raises the question &quot;What designed the designer?&quot;<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Intelligent design proponents say that the question is irrelevant to or outside the scope of intelligent design.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Richard Wein counters that the unanswered questions an explanation creates &quot;must be balanced against the improvements in our understanding which the explanation provides. Invoking an unexplained being to explain the origin of other beings (ourselves) is little more than <a href="Begging_the_question" title="wikilink">question-begging</a>. The new question raised by the explanation is as problematic as the question which the explanation purports to answer&quot;.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Richard Dawkins sees the assertion that the designer does not need to be explained, not as a contribution to knowledge, but as a <a href="thought-terminating_clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">thought-terminating clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a>.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> In the absence of observable, measurable evidence, the very question &quot;What designed the designer?&quot; leads to an <a href="turtles_all_the_way_down" title="wikilink">infinite regression</a> from which intelligent design proponents can only escape by resorting to religious creationism or logical contradiction.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a><a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>

Leaders of the movement say intelligent design exposes the limitations of scientific orthodoxy and of the <a href="secular" class="uri" title="wikilink">secular</a> philosophy of <a href="Naturalism_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">naturalism</a>. Intelligent design proponents allege that science should not be limited to naturalism and should not demand the adoption of a naturalistic <a href="Philosophy_of_science" title="wikilink">philosophy</a> that dismisses out-of-hand any explanation which contains a supernatural cause. The overall goal of the movement is to &quot;defeat [the] <a href="Materialism" title="wikilink">materialist</a> <a href="world_view" title="wikilink">world view</a>&quot; represented by the theory of <a href="evolution" class="uri" title="wikilink">evolution</a> in favor of &quot;a science consonant with <a href="Christian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christian</a> and <a href="Theism" title="wikilink">theistic</a> convictions&quot;.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>

<p>Leading intelligent design proponents have made conflicting statements regarding intelligent design.

<p>Although arguments for intelligent design are formulated in <a href="secular" class="uri" title="wikilink">secular</a> terms and intentionally avoid positing the identity of the designer, <a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> the majority of principal intelligent design advocates are publicly religious <a href="Christianity" title="wikilink">Christians</a> who have stated that in their view the designer proposed in intelligent design is <a href="God_in_Christianity" title="wikilink">the Christian conception of God</a>.

Johnson explicitly calls for intelligent design proponents to obfuscate their religious motivations so as to avoid having intelligent design identified &quot;as just another way of packaging the <a href="evangelical_Christian" title="wikilink">Christian evangelical</a> message&quot;.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> Johnson emphasizes that &quot;the first thing that has to be done is to get the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a> out of the discussion&quot;; &quot;after we have separated <a href="scientific_materialism" title="wikilink">materialist</a> <a href="prejudice" class="uri" title="wikilink">prejudice</a> from scientific fact [...] only then can 'biblical issues' be discussed&quot;.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="wedge_strategy" title="wikilink">strategy</a> of deliberately disguising the religious intent of intelligent design has been described by William Dembski in <em>The Design Inference</em>.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> In this work Dembski lists a <a href="god" class="uri" title="wikilink">god</a> or an &quot;<a href="extraterrestrial_life" title="wikilink">alien life force</a>&quot; as two possible options for the identity of the designer; however, in his book <em>Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science and Theology,</em> Dembski states that &quot;Christ is indispensable to any scientific theory, even if its practitioners don't have a clue about him. The pragmatics of a scientific theory can, to be sure, be pursued without recourse to Christ. But the conceptual soundness of the theory can in the end only be located in Christ.&quot;<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> Dembski also stated, &quot;ID is part of God's <a href="general_revelation" title="wikilink">general revelation</a> [...] Not only does intelligent design rid us of this ideology (<a href="materialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">materialism</a>), which suffocates the human spirit, but, in my personal experience, I've found that it opens the path for people to come to Christ&quot;.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> Both Johnson and Dembski cite the Bible's <a href="Gospel_of_John" title="wikilink">Gospel of John</a> as the foundation of intelligent design.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a><a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>

Such a model makes little if any positive impact on the community of scientists and other scholars&lt;U+2026&gt; The time is right for a direct approach, a single leap into the origins fray.

Morris of the <a href="Institute_for_Creation_Research" title="wikilink">Institute for Creation Research</a> (ICR) wrote, in 1999, that ID, &quot;even if well-meaning and effectively articulated, will not work! It has often been tried in the past and has failed, and it will fail today. The reason it won't work is because it is not the Biblical method.&lt;U+201D&gt; According to Morris: &lt;U+201C&gt;The evidence of intelligent design&lt;U+2026&gt; must be either followed by or accompanied by a sound presentation of true Biblical creationism if it is to be meaningful and lasting.&quot;<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> In 2002, Carl Wieland of <a href="Answers_in_Genesis" title="wikilink">Answers in Genesis</a> (AiG) criticized design advocates who, though well-intentioned, &quot;left the Bible out of it&quot; and thereby unwittingly aided and abetted the modern rejection of the Bible.

<h3 id="polls">Polls</h3>
<p>Several surveys were conducted prior to the December 2005 decision in <em>Kitzmiller v. Dover</em>, which sought to determine the level of support for intelligent design among certain groups. According to a 2005 <a href="Harris_Interactive" title="wikilink">Harris poll</a>, 10% of adults in the United States viewed human beings as &quot;so complex that they required a powerful force or intelligent being to help create them&quot;.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> Although <a href="John_Zogby" title="wikilink">Zogby polls</a> commissioned by the Discovery Institute show more support, these polls suffer from considerable flaws, such as having a very low response rate (248 out of 16,000), being conducted on behalf of an organization with an expressed interest in the outcome of the poll, and containing <a href="leading_question" title="wikilink">leading questions</a>.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a><a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a><a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>

<p>The film <em><a href="Expelled:_No_Intelligence_Allowed" title="wikilink">Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed</a></em> sparked further controversy in 2008.

There have also been allegations from some interviewees that interviews were recorded many times in order to get the exact phrasing required by the producer.

<p>A key strategy of the intelligent design movement is convincing the general public that there is a debate among scientists about whether life evolved.

Some allege that this larger debate is often the subtext for arguments made over intelligent design, though others note that intelligent design serves as an effective proxy for the religious beliefs of prominent intelligent design proponents in their efforts to advance their religious point of view within society.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a><a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a><a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a></p>
<p>Intelligent design has not presented a credible scientific case and is an attempt to teach religion in public schools, substituting public support for scientific research.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> If the argument to give &quot;equal time for all theories&quot; were actually practiced, there would be no logical limit to the number of mutually incompatible supernatural &quot;theories&quot; regarding the origins and diversity of life to be taught in the public school system, including intelligent design parodies such as the <a href="Flying_Spaghetti_Monster" title="wikilink">Flying Spaghetti Monster</a> &quot;theory&quot;; intelligent design does not provide a mechanism for discriminating among them. Philosopher of biology <a href="Elliott_Sober" title="wikilink">Elliott Sober</a>, for example, states that intelligent design is not falsifiable because &quot;[d]efenders of ID always have a way out&quot;.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a><a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> Intelligent design proponent <a href="Michael_Behe" title="wikilink">Michael Behe</a> concedes &quot;You can't prove intelligent design by experiment&quot;.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
<p>Intelligent design proponents cannot legitimately <em>infer</em> that an intelligent designer is behind the part of the process that is not understood scientifically, since they have not shown that anything supernatural has occurred. The inference that an intelligent designer created life on Earth, which advocate William Dembski has said could alternately be an &quot;alien&quot; life force,<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> has been compared to the <em><a href="A_priori_and_a_posteriori_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">a priori</a></em> claim that aliens helped the ancient Egyptians build the pyramids.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a><a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> In both cases, the effect of this outside intelligence is not repeatable, observable or falsifiable, and it violates the principle of <a href="parsimony" class="uri" title="wikilink">parsimony</a>.

<p>Supporters of intelligent design have also reached out to other faith groups with similar accounts of creation with the hope that the broader coalition will have greater influence in supporting science education that does not contradict their religious views.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> Many religious bodies have responded by <a href="Level_of_support_for_evolution#Support_for_evolution_by_religious_bodies" title="wikilink">expressing support for evolution</a>.

</ul>
<p>For any theory, hypothesis or conjecture to be considered scientific, it must meet most, and ideally all, of these criteria. The fewer criteria are met, the less scientific it is; and if it meets only a few or none at all, then it cannot be treated as scientific in any meaningful sense of the word. Typical objections to defining intelligent design as science are that it lacks consistency,<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> violates the principle of parsimony,<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> is not scientifically useful,<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> is not falsifiable,<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> is not empirically testable,<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> and is not correctable, dynamic, provisional or progressive.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a><a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a><a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a></p>
<p>Critics also say that the intelligent design doctrine does not meet the <a href="Daubert_Standard" title="wikilink">Daubert Standard</a>,<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> the criteria for <a href="scientific_evidence" title="wikilink">scientific evidence</a> mandated by the <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">US Supreme Court</a>. The Daubert Standard governs which evidence can be considered scientific in United States federal courts and most state courts. Its four criteria are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The theoretical underpinnings of the methods must yield testable predictions by means of which the theory could be falsified.</li>
<li>The methods should preferably be published in a <a href="peer_review" title="wikilink">peer-reviewed</a> journal.</li>
<li>There should be a known rate of <a href="error" class="uri" title="wikilink">error</a> that can be used in evaluating the results.</li>
<li>The methods should be generally accepted within the relevant scientific community.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <em><a href="Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District" title="wikilink">Kitzmiller v.

We have concluded that it is not, and moreover that ID cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents&quot;.</p>
<p>Against this, the philosopher <a href="Thomas_Nagel" title="wikilink">Thomas Nagel</a> argues that intelligent design is very different from <a href="creation_science" title="wikilink">creation science</a>, in that it does not depend on distortion of evidence, or on the assumption that it is immune to empirical evidence. It depends only on the idea that the hypothesis of a designer makes sense.

<h3 id="peer-review">Peer review</h3>
<p>The failure to follow the procedures of scientific discourse and the failure to submit work to the scientific community that withstands scrutiny have weighed against intelligent design's being considered as valid science.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> The intelligent design movement has not published a properly peer-reviewed article in a scientific journal.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a></p>
<p>Intelligent design, by appealing to a <a href="supernatural" class="uri" title="wikilink">supernatural</a> agent, directly conflicts with the <a href="principle" title="wikilink">principles</a> of <a href="science" class="uri" title="wikilink">science</a>, which limit its inquiries to <a href="empirical" class="uri" title="wikilink">empirical</a>, observable and ultimately <a href="falsifiable" title="wikilink">testable</a> <a href="data" class="uri" title="wikilink">data</a> and which require explanations to be based on empirical <a href="Scientific_method" title="wikilink">evidence</a>. Dembski, Behe and other intelligent design proponents say bias by the scientific community is to blame for the failure of their research to be published.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> Intelligent design proponents believe that their writings are rejected for not conforming to purely naturalistic, non-supernatural mechanisms rather than because their research is not up to &quot;journal standards&quot;, and that the merit of their articles is overlooked. Some scientists describe this claim as a <a href="conspiracy_theory" title="wikilink">conspiracy theory</a>.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> <a href="Michael_Shermer" title="wikilink">Michael Shermer</a> has rebutted the claim, noting &quot;Anyone who thinks that scientists do not question Darwinism has never been to an evolutionary conference.&quot; He noted that scientists such as <a href="Joan_Roughgarden" title="wikilink">Joan Roughgarden</a> and <a href="Lynn_Margulis" title="wikilink">Lynn Margulis</a> have challenged certain Darwinist theories and offered explanations of their own and despite this they &quot;have not been persecuted, shunned, fired or even expelled.

<p>The debate over whether intelligent design produces new research, as any scientific field must, and has legitimately attempted to publish this research, is extremely heated. Both critics and advocates point to numerous examples to make their case. For instance, the <a href="John_Templeton_Foundation" title="wikilink">Templeton Foundation</a>, a former funder of the Discovery Institute and a major supporter of projects seeking to reconcile science and religion, says that it asked intelligent design proponents to submit proposals for actual research, but none were ever submitted.

Critics, largely members of the scientific community, reject this claim, stating that no established scientific journal has yet published an intelligent design article.

<h3 id="intelligence-as-an-observable-quality">Intelligence as an observable quality</h3>
<p>The phrase <em>intelligent</em> design makes use of an assumption of the quality of an observable <a href="intelligence_(trait)" title="wikilink">intelligence</a>, a concept that has no <a href="scientific_consensus" title="wikilink">scientific consensus</a> definition. William Dembski, for example, has written that &quot;Intelligence leaves behind a characteristic signature&quot;. The characteristics of intelligence are assumed by intelligent design proponents to be <a href="observation" title="wikilink">observable</a> without specifying what the criteria for the <a href="measurement" class="uri" title="wikilink">measurement</a> of intelligence should be. Dembski, instead, asserts that &quot;in special sciences ranging from <a href="forensics" class="uri" title="wikilink">forensics</a> to <a href="archaeology" class="uri" title="wikilink">archaeology</a> to <a href="SETI" class="uri" title="wikilink">SETI</a> (the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence), appeal to a designing intelligence is indispensable&quot;.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> How this appeal is made and what this implies as to the definition of intelligence are topics left largely unaddressed. <a href="Seth_Shostak" title="wikilink">Seth Shostak</a>, a researcher with the <a href="SETI_Institute" title="wikilink">SETI Institute</a>, disputed Dembski's comparison of SETI and intelligent design, saying that intelligent design advocates base their inference of design on complexity&lt;U+2014&gt;the argument being that some biological systems are too complex to have been made by natural processes&lt;U+2014&gt;while SETI researchers are looking primarily for <a href="Artificial_creation" title="wikilink">artificiality</a>.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a></p>
<p>Critics say that the design detection methods proposed by intelligent design proponents are radically different from conventional design detection, undermining the key elements that make it possible as legitimate science. Intelligent design proponents, they say, are proposing both searching for a designer without knowing anything about that designer's abilities, parameters, or intentions (which scientists do know when searching for the results of human intelligence), as well as denying the very distinction between natural/artificial design that allows scientists to compare complex designed artifacts against the background of the sorts of complexity found in nature.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a></p>
<p>As a means of criticism, certain <a href="scientific_skepticism" title="wikilink">skeptics</a> have pointed to a challenge of intelligent design derived from the study of <a href="artificial_intelligence" title="wikilink">artificial intelligence</a>. The criticism is a counter to intelligent design claims about what makes a design intelligent, specifically that &quot;no preprogrammed device can be truly intelligent, that intelligence is irreducible to natural processes&quot;.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> This claim is similar in type to an assumption of <a href="Cartesian_dualism" title="wikilink">Cartesian dualism</a> that posits a strict separation between &quot;mind&quot; and the material <a href="Universe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Universe</a>. However, in studies of artificial intelligence, while there is an implicit assumption that supposed &quot;intelligence&quot; or <a href="creativity" class="uri" title="wikilink">creativity</a> of a <a href="computer_program" title="wikilink">computer program</a> is determined by the capabilities given to it by the computer <a href="programmer" class="uri" title="wikilink">programmer</a>, artificial intelligence need not be bound to an inflexible system of rules. Rather, if a computer program can access <a href="randomness" class="uri" title="wikilink">randomness</a> as a function, this effectively allows for a flexible, creative, and adaptive intelligence. <a href="Evolutionary_algorithms" title="wikilink">Evolutionary algorithms</a>, a subfield of machine learning (itself a subfield of artificial intelligence), have been used to mathematically demonstrate that randomness and selection can be used to &quot;evolve&quot; complex, highly adapted structures that are not explicitly designed by a programmer. Evolutionary algorithms use the Darwinian metaphor of random mutation, selection and the survival of the fittest to solve diverse mathematical and scientific problems that are usually not solvable using conventional methods. Intelligence derived from randomness is essentially indistinguishable from the &quot;innate&quot; intelligence associated with biological organisms, and poses a challenge to the intelligent design conception that intelligence itself necessarily requires a designer. <a href="Cognitive_science" title="wikilink">Cognitive science</a> continues to investigate the nature of intelligence along these lines of inquiry. The intelligent design community, for the most part, relies on the assumption that intelligence is readily apparent as a fundamental and basic property of complex systems.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="arguments-from-ignorance">Arguments from ignorance</h3>
<p><a href="Eugenie_Scott" title="wikilink">Eugenie Scott</a>, along with Glenn Branch and other critics, has argued that many points raised by intelligent design proponents are <a href="Argument_from_ignorance" title="wikilink">arguments from ignorance</a>.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> In the argument from ignorance, a lack of evidence for one view is erroneously argued to constitute proof of the correctness of another view. Scott and Branch say that intelligent design is an argument from ignorance because it relies on a lack of knowledge for its conclusion: lacking a natural explanation for certain specific aspects of evolution, we assume intelligent cause. They contend most scientists would reply that the unexplained is not unexplainable, and that &quot;we don't know yet&quot; is a more appropriate response than invoking a cause outside science.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> Particularly, <a href="Michael_Behe" title="wikilink">Michael Behe</a>'s demands for ever more detailed explanations of the historical evolution of molecular systems seem to assume a <a href="false_dichotomy" title="wikilink">false dichotomy</a>, where either evolution or design is the proper explanation, and any perceived failure of evolution becomes a victory for design. Scott and Branch also contend that the supposedly novel contributions proposed by intelligent design proponents have not served as the basis for any productive scientific research.</p>
<p>Intelligent design has also been characterized as a &quot;<a href="god_of_the_gaps" title="wikilink">god of the gaps</a>&quot; argument, which has the following form:</p>
<p>:*There is a gap in scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>:*The gap is filled with acts of God (or <a href="intelligent_designer" title="wikilink">intelligent designer</a>) and therefore proves the existence of God (or intelligent designer).</p>
<p>A god-of-the-gaps argument is the <a href="theological" class="uri" title="wikilink">theological</a> version of an <a href="argument_from_ignorance" title="wikilink">argument from ignorance</a>. A key feature of this type of argument is that it merely answers outstanding questions with explanations (often <a href="supernatural" class="uri" title="wikilink">supernatural</a>) that are unverifiable and ultimately themselves subject to unanswerable questions.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a></p>

<p>Subsequently, the decision has been examined in a search for flaws and conclusions, partly by intelligent design supporters aiming to avoid future defeats in court.

However, we are convinced that in order to defeat materialism, we must cut it off at its source. That source is scientific materialism. This is precisely our strategy. If we view the predominant materialistic science as a giant tree, our strategy is intended to function as a 'wedge' that, while relatively small, can split the trunk when applied at its weakest points. The very beginning of this strategy, the 'thin edge of the wedge,' was Phillip Johnson's critique of Darwinism begun in 1991 in Darwinism on Trial, and continued in Reason in the Balance and Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds. Michael Behe's highly successful Darwin's Black Box followed Johnson's work. We are building on this momentum, broadening the wedge with a positive scientific alternative to materialistic scientific theories, which has come to be called the theory of intelligent design (ID). Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions&quot;.</em> <a href="http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf">Wedge Document</a> Discovery Institute, 1999.

<li id="fn181">Intelligent design fails to pass Occam's razor. Adding entities (an intelligent agent, a designer) to the equation is not strictly necessary to explain events. See, e.g., <a href="#fnref181" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn183">The designer is not falsifiable, since its existence is typically asserted without sufficient conditions to allow a falsifying observation. The designer being beyond the realm of the observable, claims about its existence can be neither supported nor undermined by observation, making intelligent design and the argument from design analytic <em>a posteriori</em> arguments. See, e.g.,  <a href="s:Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District/2:Context#Page_22_of_139" title="wikilink">Ruling, p. 22</a> and <a href="s:Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District/4:Whether_ID_Is_Science#Page_77_of_139" title="wikilink">p. 77</a>.<a href="#fnref183" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn184">That intelligent design is not empirically testable stems from the fact that it violates a basic premise of science, naturalism.

<li id="fn185">Intelligent design professes to offer an answer that does not need to be defined or explained, the intelligent agent, designer. By asserting a conclusion that cannot be accounted for scientifically, <em>the designer</em>, intelligent design cannot be sustained by any further explanation, and objections raised to those who accept intelligent design make little headway. Thus intelligent design is not a provisional assessment of data which can change when new information is discovered. Once it is claimed that a conclusion that need not be accounted for has been established, there is simply no possibility of future correction. The idea of the progressive growth of scientific ideas is required to explain previous data and any previously unexplainable data. See, e.g., the brief explanation in  <a href="s:Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District/4:Whether_ID_Is_Science#Page_66_of_139" title="wikilink">p. 66</a>.<a href="#fnref185" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn212">&quot;For human artifacts, we know the designer's identity, human, and the mechanism of design, as we have experience based upon empirical evidence that humans can make such things, as well as many other attributes including the designer's abilities, needs, and desires. With ID, proponents assert that they refuse to propose hypotheses on the designer's identity, do not propose a mechanism, and the designer, he/she/it/they, has never been seen. In that vein, defense expert Professor Minnich agreed that in the case of human artifacts and objects, we know the identity and capacities of the human designer, but we do not know any of those attributes for the designer of biological life. In addition, Professor Behe agreed that for the design of human artifacts, we know the designer and its attributes and we have a baseline for human design that does not exist for design of biological systems. Professor Behe's only response to these seemingly insurmountable points of disanalogy was that the inference still works in science fiction movies&quot;.&lt;U+2014&gt;, <a href="s:Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District/4:Whether_ID_Is_Science#Page_81_of_139" title="wikilink">p. 81</a><a href="#fnref212" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
