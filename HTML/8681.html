<p>The <strong>Shabakunk Creek</strong> is a <a href="tributary" class="uri" title="wikilink">tributary</a> of the <a href="Assunpink_Creek" title="wikilink">Assunpink Creek</a> in western <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a> in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Via the Assunpink, its water ultimately flows into the <a href="Delaware_River" title="wikilink">Delaware River</a>.

<p>The  main branch of the Shabakunk Creek is born near what was once known as <a href="Twin_Pine_Airport" title="wikilink">Twin Pine Airport</a> in <a href="Hopewell_Township,_Mercer_County,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Hopewell Township</a>. Flowing southwards, it flows under <a href="County_Route_546_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Pennington-Lawrenceville Road</a> and then passes underneath <a href="Interstate_95_in_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">I-95</a>, joining with several unnamed tributaries in the process. From this point, it continues southward into <a href="Ewing_Township,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Ewing</a>, crosses underneath Bull Run Road and <a href="List_of_county_routes_in_Mercer_County,_New_Jersey#636" title="wikilink">Ewingville Road</a>, and enters the 11-acre <a href="Lake_Sylva" title="wikilink">Lake Sylva</a> on the campus of <a href="The_College_of_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">The College of New Jersey</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Below Lake Sylva, the Shabakunk flows southeastward, passing under Green Lane and then Ewingville Road for a second time. For a short distance it forms the border of Ewing and <a href="Lawrence_Township,_Mercer_County,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Lawrence</a> townships before joining with the West Branch Shabakunk Creek, turning eastward and completely entering Lawrence. After passing underneath <a href="U.S._Route_206" title="wikilink">Lawrence Road</a>, <a href="County_Route_583_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Princeton Pike</a> and <a href="U.S._Route_1_Business_(Trenton,_New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Brunswick Pike</a>, the stream is impounded within <a href="Colonial_Lake" title="wikilink">Colonial Lake</a>. Below Colonial Lake, the stream crosses underneath the <a href="U.S._Route_1_in_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Trenton Freeway</a> and the <a href="Delaware_and_Raritan_Canal" title="wikilink">Delaware and Raritan Canal</a> before finally reaching its terminus at the Assunpink Creek. <img src="West_Branch_Shabakunk_Creek_at_the_Thurston_Avenue_Foot_Bridge.JPG" title="fig:View southeast along the West Branch Shabakunk Creek from the Rutledge Avenue Footbridge." alt="View southeast along the West Branch Shabakunk Creek from the Rutledge Avenue Footbridge." /></p>
<h3 id="west-branch">West Branch</h3>
<p>The  West Branch of the Shabakunk Creek emerges from the airfield of <a href="Trenton-Mercer_Airport" title="wikilink">Trenton-Mercer Airport</a> in Ewing. From there, it flows generally southeastward, quickly joining with several small, unnamed tributaries while passing underneath the Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad (formerly owned by the <a href="Reading_Company" title="wikilink">Reading Railroad</a>, now owned by <a href="Conrail" class="uri" title="wikilink">Conrail</a>), <a href="List_of_county_routes_in_Mercer_County,_New_Jersey#611" title="wikilink">Scotch Road</a> and <a href="List_of_county_routes_in_Mercer_County,_New_Jersey#636" title="wikilink">Upper Ferry Road</a>. It then passes underneath Carlton Avenue, <a href="List_of_county_routes_in_Mercer_County,_New_Jersey#643" title="wikilink">Lower Ferry Road</a>, Stratford Avenue, Central Avenue, <a href="List_of_county_routes_in_Mercer_County,_New_Jersey#622" title="wikilink">North Olden Avenue Extension</a>, <a href="New_Jersey_Route_31" title="wikilink">Pennington Road</a>, <a href="List_of_county_routes_in_Mercer_County,_New_Jersey#636" title="wikilink">Parkside Avenue</a> and <a href="List_of_county_routes_in_Mercer_County,_New_Jersey#627" title="wikilink">Prospect Street</a>. At this point it turns northeasterly, passes under North Olden Avenue Extension again and finally flows underneath <a href="List_of_county_routes_in_Mercer_County,_New_Jersey#613" title="wikilink">Spruce Street</a>. Shortly thereafter it meets the main branch at the Ewing/Lawrence border. Much of the West Branch Shabakunk Creek's course between Pennington Road and Spruce Street is canalized due to heavy commercial development, with at least one structure built directly over the stream.</p>

<p>Under the command of Colonel <a href="Edward_Hand" title="wikilink">Edward Hand</a>, a successful delaying action was fought at the Shabakunk Creek near Lawrence Road which prevented British forces from reaching Trenton before nightfall on January 2, 1777. This skirmish was part of the <a href="Battle_of_the_Assunpink_Creek" title="wikilink">Second Battle of Trenton</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="flooding-and-associated-improvements">1996 flooding and associated improvements</h3>
<p>On June 12, 1996, a 100-year <a href="flash_flood" title="wikilink">flash flood</a> occurred on the West Branch Shabakunk Creek in Ewing. Over 7 inches of rain fell in just 4 hours, resulting in $10 million in damages and $24 million in municipal overtime costs due to cleanup efforts (in 1996 dollars). Over 175 residences and 75 businesses were affected, and some businesses were closed for nearly 2 weeks due to the cleanup and repair of damage. As a result, a $4.2 million flood and <a href="erosion_control" title="wikilink">erosion control</a> project was initiated to stabilize the banks and create storm water <a href="detention_basin" title="wikilink">detention basins</a> along the more heavily developed central and southern portions of the creek's course.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
