The film is about Scott Pilgrim (<a href="Michael_Cera" title="wikilink">Michael Cera</a>) meeting the girl of his dreams, Ramona Flowers (<a href="Mary_Elizabeth_Winstead" title="wikilink">Mary Elizabeth Winstead</a>). In order to win Ramona over, Scott learns that he must defeat Ramona's seven evil exes, who are coming to kill him.</p>
<p><em>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</em> was planned as a film after the first volume of the comic was released. Director Wright became attached to the program and began filming in March 2009 in Toronto, Ontario. <em>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</em> premiered after a panel discussion at the <a href="San_Diego_Comic-Con_International" title="wikilink">San Diego Comic-Con International</a> on July 22, 2010.

<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>The story begins in <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a> where <a href="List_of_Scott_Pilgrim_characters#Scott_Pilgrim" title="wikilink">Scott Pilgrim</a> (<a href="Michael_Cera" title="wikilink">Michael Cera</a>), the bass guitarist for the band &quot;<a href="List_of_Scott_Pilgrim_characters#Bands" title="wikilink">Sex Bob-omb</a>&quot;, begins dating high-schooler <a href="List_of_Scott_Pilgrim_characters#Knives_Chau" title="wikilink">Knives Chau</a> (<a href="Ellen_Wong" title="wikilink">Ellen Wong</a>) despite the protests of his friends and bandmates. He later meets a mysterious American girl named <a href="List_of_Scott_Pilgrim_characters#Ramona_Flowers" title="wikilink">Ramona Flowers</a> (<a href="Mary_Elizabeth_Winstead" title="wikilink">Mary Elizabeth Winstead</a>) and begins dating her, losing interest in Knives. Sex Bob-omb competes in a <a href="battle_of_the_bands" title="wikilink">battle of the bands</a> to win a <a href="record_contract" title="wikilink">record contract</a> with the label G-Man when Scott is attacked by Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha), the first of <a href="List_of_Scott_Pilgrim_characters#Ramona&#39;s_Evil_Exes" title="wikilink">Ramona's Seven Evil Exes</a> who seek to control Ramona's love life. Scott defeats Matthew and learns from Ramona that, in order for them to continue dating, he must defeat each member of the League of Evil Exes.</p>
<p>After learning that popular actor and skateboarder Lucas Lee (<a href="Chris_Evans_(actor)" title="wikilink">Chris Evans</a>), the second evil ex, is coming to Toronto to film a movie, Scott is forced to break up with Knives, who is devastated and tries everything she can to win him back. Scott successfully defeats Lee by tricking him into performing a dangerous skateboard stunt where he crashes and dissolves into coins. He encounters the third evil ex, Todd Ingram (<a href="Brandon_Routh" title="wikilink">Brandon Routh</a>), who serves as bass guitarist for Scott's ex-girlfriend <a href="List_of_Scott_Pilgrim_characters#Supporting_characters" title="wikilink">Envy Adams</a>' (<a href="Brie_Larson" title="wikilink">Brie Larson</a>) band, &quot;<a href="List_of_Scott_Pilgrim_characters#Bands" title="wikilink">The Clash at Demonhead</a>&quot;. Todd initially overpowers Scott using his <a href="psychic" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychic</a> <a href="veganism" title="wikilink">vegan</a> abilities, which are stripped from him by the &quot;Vegan Police&quot; after Scott tricks him into drinking coffee with <a href="half_and_half" title="wikilink">half and half</a>, allowing Scott to win the fight.</p>
<p>Following the defeat of the fourth evil ex Roxy Richter (<a href="Mae_Whitman" title="wikilink">Mae Whitman</a>), Scott's relationship with Ramona begins to falter as he grows increasingly upset with her dating history. During the second round of the battle of the bands, Sex Bob-omb faces off against the fifth and six evil exes, twin Katayanagi brothers, Kyle (Shota Saito) and Ken (Keita Saito), earning Scott an <a href="extra_life" title="wikilink">extra life</a> upon their defeat. During the battle, Scott sees Ramona together with her seventh and final evil ex, Gideon Graves (<a href="Jason_Schwartzman" title="wikilink">Jason Schwartzman</a>), who turns out to be Sex Bob-omb's sponsor G-Man. Ramona breaks up with Scott as she is unable to leave Gideon's side due to a <a href="integrated_circuit" title="wikilink">chip</a> in the back of her head, and Scott leaves Sex Bob-omb as they sign on to play at Gideon's new club, the Chaos Theatre.</p>
<p>Scott goes to the club and professes his love for Ramona, gaining the &quot;Power of Love&quot; sword which he uses to fight Gideon. Knives arrives to battle Ramona over Scott who, while trying to break up the girls' fight, accidentally reveals that he cheated on both of them with each other before he is killed by Gideon. Scott uses his extra life to restart his battle with Gideon, this time resolving his issues with his friends and owning up to his own faults, gaining the even stronger &quot;Power of Self-Respect&quot; sword and defeating Gideon alongside Knives. Free from Gideon's control, Ramona encourages Scott and Knives to stay together while she prepares to leave to start over. Upon Knives' insistence, Scott instead follows Ramona as he always wanted, and the two begin their relationship anew.</p>

<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>After artist <a href="Bryan_Lee_O&#39;Malley" title="wikilink">Bryan Lee O'Malley</a> completed the first volume of <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>, his publisher <a href="Oni_Press" title="wikilink">Oni Press</a> contacted producer <a href="Marc_E._Platt" title="wikilink">Marc Platt</a> with the proposition for a <a href="film_adaptation" title="wikilink">film version</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="Universal_Studios" title="wikilink">Universal Studios</a> contracted Edgar Wright who had just finished his last film, <em><a href="Shaun_of_the_Dead" title="wikilink">Shaun of the Dead</a></em>, to adapt the <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> comics.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> O'Malley originally had mixed feelings about a film adaptation, stating that he &quot;expected them to turn it into a full-on action comedy with some actor that I hated...I didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t even care. I was a starving artist, and I was like, 'Please, just give me some money.'&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>In May 2005, the studio signed <a href="Michael_Bacall" title="wikilink">Michael Bacall</a> to write the screenplay for the adaptation.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> By January 2009, filmmakers rounded out its cast for the film, now titled <em>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</em>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Edgar Wright does note that O'Malley was &quot;very involved&quot; with the script of the film from the start, and even contributed lines to and &quot;polished&quot; certain scenes in the film. Likewise due to the long development process several lines from the various scripts written by Wright and Bacall ended up in books four and five as well.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>O'Malley confirmed that no material from <em>Scott Pilgrim's Finest Hour</em>, the sixth Scott Pilgrim volume, would appear in the film, as production had already begun. While he had given ideas and suggestions for the final act of the film, he admitted to that some of those plans might change throughout the writing process and ultimately stated that &quot;Their ending is their ending&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> O'Malley gave Wright and Bacall his notes for the sixth book while filming took place.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In the film's original ending, written before the release of the final <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> book, Scott ultimately gets together with Knives. In the book series and the final film, Scott and Ramona get together.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="casting">Casting</h3>
<p>Director Wright felt confident with his casting in the film. Wright stated that &quot;Like with <em><a href="Hot_Fuzz" title="wikilink">Hot Fuzz</a></em> how we had great people in every single tiny part, it's the same with this. What's great with this is that there&lt;U+2019&gt;s people you know, like with Michael [Cera] and Jason [Schwartzman], and then we have people who are up and coming, like Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza and Brie Larson, and then there&lt;U+2019&gt;s complete unknowns as well&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> There was no studio interference with casting more unknowns, as Wright stated that &quot;Universal never really gave me any problems about casting bigger people, because in a way Michael [Cera] has starred in two $100 million-plus movies, and also a lot of the other people, though they're not the biggest names, people certainly know who they are.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Wright planned on casting Michael Cera while writing <em>Hot Fuzz</em> after watching episodes of <em><a href="Arrested_Development_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Arrested Development</a></em>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Wright said he needed an actor that &quot;audiences will still follow even when the character is being a bit of an ass.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Edgar Wright ran all his casting decisions by O'Malley during the casting session.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Mary Elizabeth Winstead was Wright's choice for Ramona Flowers two years before filming had started, because &quot;she has a very sunny disposition as a person, so it was interesting to get her to play a version of herself that was broken inside. She's great in the film because she causes a lot of chaos but remains supernaturally grounded.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Ellen Wong auditioned for the part of Knives Chau three times. On her second audition Edgar Wright was surprised to find that that she had a green belt in taekwondo which surprised him that this &quot;sweetfaced young lady being a secret badass&quot;.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

The tracks were sung by actor Erik Knudson, who plays Crash in the film. Drew stated that the reason behind this was that &quot;[he] knew that [Knudson] didn't need to be a singer to pull [it] off&quot; because the songs were &quot;so quick and punk and fast&quot; and &quot;it needed to be the character's voice.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Metric are the influence of the band Clash at Demonhead in the film and have contributed the song &quot;Black Sheep&quot; to the film.

<p>At a test screening, director <a href="Kevin_Smith" title="wikilink">Kevin Smith</a> was impressed by the film saying &quot;That movie is great.

<p>After premiere screenings at the <a href="San_Diego_Comic-Con_International" title="wikilink">San Diego Comic-Con International</a>, the film received mixed reviews. <em><a href="Variety_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Variety</a></em> gave the film a mixed review, referring to the film as &quot;An example of attention-deficit filmmaking at both its finest and its most frustrating&quot; and that &quot;anyone over 25 is likely to find director Edgar Wright's adaptation of the cult graphic novel exhausting, like playing chaperone at a party full of oversexed college kids.&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Hollywood_Reporter" title="wikilink">The Hollywood Reporter</a></em> wrote a negative review, stating that &quot;What's disappointing is that this is all so juvenile.
