<p>The <strong><em>Chrono</em> series</strong> is a <a href="video_game" title="wikilink">video game</a> franchise owned by <a href="Square_Enix" title="wikilink">Square Enix</a> (formerly <a href="Square_Co." title="wikilink">Square Co.</a>). It began in <a href="1995_in_video_gaming" title="wikilink">1995</a> with the <a href="time_travel_in_fiction" title="wikilink">time travel</a> <a href="console_role-playing_game" title="wikilink">console role-playing game</a> <em><a href="Chrono_Trigger" title="wikilink">Chrono Trigger</a></em>, which spawned two continuations, <em><a href="Radical_Dreamers" title="wikilink">Radical Dreamers</a></em> and <em><a href="Chrono_Cross" title="wikilink">Chrono Cross</a></em>. A promotional anime called <em><a href="#Dimensional_Adventure_Numa_Monjar" title="wikilink">Dimensional Adventure Numa Monjar</a></em> and a <a href="Final_Fantasy_Chronicles" title="wikilink">port of <em>Chrono Trigger</em></a> were also produced.</p>
<p>As of <a href="March_31" title="wikilink">March 31</a>, <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>, <em>Chrono Trigger</em> was, with 2.65 million units, Square Enix's 12th best-selling game; <em>Chrono Cross</em> was, with 1.5 million units, the 24th.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The games have been subject to generally positive criticism.</p>

<p><em><a href="Chrono_Trigger" title="wikilink">Chrono Trigger</a></em> was produced in <a href="1995_in_video_gaming" title="wikilink">1995</a> by <a href="Kazuhiko_Aoki" title="wikilink">Kazuhiko Aoki</a> and directed by <a href="Akihiko_Matsui" title="wikilink">Akihiko Matsui</a>, <a href="Yoshinori_Kitase" title="wikilink">Yoshinori Kitase</a> and <a href="Takashi_Tokita" title="wikilink">Takashi Tokita</a>. The development of the game was dubbed the &quot;Dream Project&quot;, because it was headed by a &quot;Dream Team&quot; composed of supervisor <a href="Hironobu_Sakaguchi" title="wikilink">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a>, of <em><a href="Final_Fantasy" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy</a></em> fame, as well as <a href="freelance" class="uri" title="wikilink">freelance</a> supervisor <a href="Yuuji_Horii" title="wikilink">Yuuji Horii</a> and character designer <a href="Akira_Toriyama" title="wikilink">Akira Toriyama</a>, both of <em><a href="Dragon_Quest" title="wikilink">Dragon Quest</a></em> fame.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Yuuji Horii worked on the general outline of the story; as a fan of <a href="time_travel_in_fiction" title="wikilink">time travel</a> fictions, such as the TV series <em><a href="Time_Tunnel" title="wikilink">Time Tunnel</a></em>, he focused on a theme of time travel for <em>Chrono Trigger</em>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The outline was then finalized by story planner and script writer <a href="Masato_Kato" title="wikilink">Masato Kato</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="1996_in_video_gaming" title="wikilink">1996</a>, Masato Kato and several other members of the <em>Chrono Trigger</em> staff worked on a minor project for the <a href="Super_Famicom" title="wikilink">Super Famicom</a> <a href="Satellaview" class="uri" title="wikilink">Satellaview</a> extension, titled <em><a href="Radical_Dreamers:_Nusumenai_H&lt;U+014D&gt;seki" title="wikilink">Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai H&lt;U+014D&gt;seki</a></em>. Initially, the game was intended to be a short, original text-based adventure developed in three months with almost no planning. Nevertheless, by the end of the development, Masato Kato had connected the game's plot and characters to <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, turning it into a <a href="side_story" title="wikilink">side story</a>. Since the platform of the game was not mainstream, the connections were however left blurred on purpose and were not advertised on the game's release.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="1999_in_video_gaming" title="wikilink">1999</a>, a continuation of <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, titled <em><a href="Chrono_Cross" title="wikilink">Chrono Cross</a></em>, was announced as being in development. Although the &quot;Dream Team&quot; members did not participate in <em>Chrono Cross</em>, the game was developed mostly by the same staff as the first installment.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In terms of basic system and gameplay, producer <a href="Hiromichi_Tanaka" title="wikilink">Hiromichi Tanaka</a> made it clear that the new installment was not a sequel to <em>Chrono Trigger</em>; rather, the game designers' approach was to make the &quot;gameplay evolve with the hardware&quot;, creating a completely new game while restructuring the former style so as to maximize the performance of the console.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The gameplay focuses on the theme of <a href="parallel_universe_(fiction)" title="wikilink">paralel worlds</a> rather than time travel, although the latter is still deeply involved in the game's plot. In terms of storyline, <em>Chrono Cross</em> was described by director and scenario writer Masato Kato as &quot;not a <em>Chrono Trigger 2</em>&quot;, but &quot;a result of a pulled trigger&quot;, &quot;another <em>Chrono</em>&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>

<p>The music of the <em>Chrono</em> series was mainly composed by <a href="Yasunori_Mitsuda" title="wikilink">Yasunori Mitsuda</a>. <em><a href="Chrono_Trigger" title="wikilink">Chrono Trigger</a></em> was the first for which he had served as composer. However, after Mitsuda contracted <a href="stomach_ulcer" title="wikilink">stomach ulcers</a>, <em>Final Fantasy</em> composer <a href="Nobuo_Uematsu" title="wikilink">Nobuo Uematsu</a> was brought onto the project to compose ten songs.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> At the time of the game's release, the quantity of its tracks and sound effects were unprecedented.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Additionally, a one-disc <a href="acid_jazz" title="wikilink">acid jazz</a> arrangement called <em><a href="Music_of_the_Chrono_series#The_Brink_of_Time" title="wikilink">The Brink of Time</a></em> was also released. Mitsuda went on to compose the soundtrack for <em><a href="Radical_Dreamers" title="wikilink">Radical Dreamers</a></em>, which was never commercially released as an album.</p>
<p>In <a href="1999_in_video_gaming" title="wikilink">1999</a>, Yasunori Mitsuda, now a freelance composer, returned to score the soundtrack for <em><a href="Chrono_Cross" title="wikilink">Chrono Cross</a></em> after being contacted by Masato Kato.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Mitsuda decided to center his work around <a href="old_world" title="wikilink">old world</a> cultural influences, including Mediterranean, <a href="Fado" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fado</a>, <a href="Celtic_music" title="wikilink">Celtic</a>, and percussive <a href="Music_of_Africa" title="wikilink">African</a> music.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <em><a href="Xenogears" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xenogears</a></em> contributor <a href="Tomohiko_Kira" title="wikilink">Tomohiko Kira</a> played guitar on the beginning and ending themes. <a href="Noriko_Mitose" title="wikilink">Noriko Mitose</a>, as selected by Masato Kato, sang the ending song, &quot;Radical Dreamers ~ Le Tr&lt;U+00E9&gt;sor Interdit&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Mitsuda was happy to accomplish even half of what he envisioned.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Certain songs were ported from the score of <em>Radical Dreamers</em>, while other entries in the soundtrack contain <a href="leitmotif" title="wikilink">leitmotifs</a> from both <em>Chrono Trigger</em> and <em>Radical Dreamers</em>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="2006_in_video_gaming" title="wikilink">2006</a>, Yasunori Mitsuda arranged versions of music from the <em>Chrono</em> series for <a href="Play!_A_Video_Game_Symphony" title="wikilink">Play!</a> video game music concerts, presenting the <em>Chrono Trigger</em> and <em>Chrono Cross</em> main themes, as well as &quot;Frog's Theme&quot;, and &quot;To Far Away Times&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Ct-nuumamonjaa.jpg" title="fig:Nu on the left, Mamo on the right, and Gonzalez in the background." alt="Nu on the left, Mamo on the right, and Gonzalez in the background." width="220" />  is a 16-minute humoristic and promotional <em>Chrono Trigger</em> <a href="anime" class="uri" title="wikilink">anime</a> which was broadcast at the <a href="Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> <a href="V-Jump" class="uri" title="wikilink">V-Jump</a> Festival of <a href="July_31" title="wikilink">July 31</a>, <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a>.

<p>The anime takes place in the same setting as <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, the night before the beginning of the game's events. The empty Millennial Fair is invested by a festive gathering of monsters coming through portals. The two protagonists, a <a href="Characters_of_Chrono_Trigger#Other_non-playable_characters" title="wikilink">Nu</a> and a Mamo (a type of monster called Kilwala in the English version of the game), voiced by <a href="Chaf&lt;U+016B&gt;rin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chaf&lt;U+016B&gt;rin</a> and <a href="Mayumi_Tanaka" title="wikilink">Mayumi Tanaka</a> respectively, try to recruit members for their group &quot;Nuumamonjaa&quot;. Finding no one willing to join them, they wander the fair and interrupt the robot <a href="Characters_of_Chrono_Trigger#Johnny" title="wikilink">Johnny</a>'s show, who is voiced by <a href="Shinichir&lt;U+014D&gt;_Miki" title="wikilink">Shinichir&lt;U+014D&gt; Miki</a>.</p>
<p>Later, Nu enters a drinking contest and wins a golden shovel, with the help of a controller that resembles that of a <a href="Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System" title="wikilink">Super Famicom</a>. Nu goes into the bushes after the contest to urinate, and stumbles upon Gonzalez (a robot called Gato in the English version of the game). Gonzalez, voiced by <a href="Fumihiko_Tachiki" title="wikilink">Fumihiko Tachiki</a>, activates and chases the group, while singing his line from the game: <em>Aa Gonzaresu. Ore-wa tsuyoi. Ore ni kattara shirubaa pointo</em> (&quot;Ah, Gonzalez. I am strong. Beat me up and get silver points&quot;).</p>
<p>Eventually, Nu and Mamo end up on Gonzalez' back as he runs uncontrollably, entering a race against Johnny. In an attempt to stop Gonzalez, Nu presses a large button on Gonzales' back, which causes a large boxing glove on a spring to hit Johnny. A dazed Johnny flies through the air and solemnly recites a <a href="haiku" class="uri" title="wikilink">haiku</a> before smashing into a wall. Gonzalez' singing voice can still be heard from where Nu and Mamo are.</p>
<p>In the morning, Gato is still singing, but runs out of power and falls to the ground. A group of people is seen watching in the foreground, including <a href="Characters_of_Chrono_Trigger#Crono" title="wikilink">Crono</a> and <a href="Characters_of_Chrono_Trigger#Lucca" title="wikilink">Lucca</a>. The credits show Nu and Mamo parodying scenes from the game.</p>
