From the 1210s, the dignitaries of the central administration and the Royal Households were referred to as &quot;barons of the realm&quot; <em>(barones regni)</em> in official documents but their <a href="legal" class="uri" title="wikilink">legal</a> status was exclusively linked to the office they held and their offsprings could not inherit it.</p>

In 1487, a new expression appeared in a deed of <a href="armistice" class="uri" title="wikilink">armistice</a> signed by King Matthias: the document mentioned 19 noble families as &quot;natural barons in Hungary&quot; <em>(barones naturales in Hungaria)</em> in contrast to the &quot;barons of the realm&quot; whose position was still linked to the high offices they happened to be holding. During the reign of King <a href="Vladislaus_II_of_Bohemia_and_Hungary" title="wikilink">Vladislaus II</a>, the special legal position of certain noble families was enacted and the act referred to their members as &quot;barons&quot; even if they were not holding any high offices at that time.</p>
<p>Although in the 16th century, the <em><a href="Tripartitum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tripartitum</a></em> (a law book collecting the body of common laws that had arisen from customary practise) declared again that all the nobles enjoyed the same liberties independently of their offices, birth or wealth, but in practise, even it acknowledged that some differences had been existing within the nobility. Nevertheless, the <em>Tripartitum</em> still distinguished between the &quot;true barons&quot; <em>(veri barones)</em> who held the highest offices and the &quot;barons only by name&quot; <em>(barones solo nomine)</em> who did not hold any high offices but used noble titles. From 1526, the <a href="Habsburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Habsburg</a> kings rewarded their partisans with hereditary titles such as <em>baron</em> and <em>count</em> and the members of the families wearing such titles were invited to attend in person at the <a href="Diet_(assembly)" title="wikilink">Diets</a>. This costumary practise was confirmed by <a href="legislation" class="uri" title="wikilink">legislation</a> in 1608, when the Diet passed an <a href="Act_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">act</a> prescribing that the <a href="monarch" title="wikilink">monarchs</a> were to send a personal invitation to the members of the upper nobility (<em>i.e.</em>, to the &quot;true barons&quot; and to the nobles authorized by the kings to use hereditary titles) when convoking the Diet; thenceforward, the <a href="prelate" title="wikilink">prelates</a> and the members of the upper nobility formed the Diets' <a href="Upper_House" title="wikilink">Upper House</a>.</p>

From 1688, the members of the upper nobility were entitled by law to create an <a href="fee_tail" title="wikilink">entail</a> <em>(fideicommissum)</em> which ensured that their estates were inherited without division in contrast to the common law that prescribed that a noble's inheritance was to be divided equally among his heirs.</p>

In 1885, aristocrats who did not meet all the financial criteria set up by legislation, lost their seat in the legislative body. The Upper House was dissolved in 1918 and it was reorganized only in 1926, but thenceforward, the members of the upper nobility were only entitled to elect some representatives to the Upper House.</p>
<p>In 1945, the <a href="land_reform" title="wikilink">land reform</a> liquidated the financial basis of the special status of the upper nobility. And finally, following the declaration of the <a href="Republic_of_Hungary" title="wikilink">Republic of Hungary</a>, the Parliament passed an act that prohibited the use of noble titles in 1946.</p>

<p>During his reign, King Sigismund granted several royal castles and the royal domains attached to them to the members of the barons' leagues; by 1407, the number of royal castles decreased from 111 to 66.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> The king, however, wanted to strengthen his position and for this purpose, in 1408, he founded the <a href="Order_of_the_Dragon" title="wikilink">Order of the Dragon</a>, a chivalric order whose 22 members (<em>e.g.</em>, the Palatine <a href="Garai" title="wikilink">Nicholas II Garai</a>, count <a href="Hermann_II_of_Celje" title="wikilink">Hermann II of Celje</a> and the <em>Despot</em> <a href="Stefan_Lazarevi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Stefan Lazarevi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>) swore fidelity to the king, his queen and their future children.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a><a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>Some signs of the increasing self-consciousness of the &quot;magnates&quot; appeared in the 1420s.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Some of them commenced to use names that referred to the high office their ancestors had held; <em>e.g.</em>, the members of the Losonci family started to call themselves <em>B&lt;U+00E1&gt;nfi</em> meaning the &quot;son of a <a href="Ban_(title)" title="wikilink">Ban</a>&quot; in reference to their forefather who had been the Ban of Dalmatia and Croatia.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> Other magnates clearly referred to their descent from former &quot;barons of the realm&quot; in their deeds or used noble titles (such as &quot;count&quot; or &quot;duke&quot;) abroad following the example of the western nobility although the public law of the kingdom did not accept their claim to distinctive titles.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<p>When King Sigismund's son-in-law, <a href="Albert_II_of_Germany" title="wikilink">Albert I</a> (1437&lt;U+2013&gt;1439) was proclaimed king, he had to take a solemn oath that he would exercise his <a href="royal_prerogative" title="wikilink">prerogative powers</a> only with the consent of the Royal Council.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> Following King Albert's death, a civil war broke out between the followers of his posthumous son, King <a href="Ladislaus_the_Posthumous" title="wikilink">Ladislaus V</a> (1440&lt;U+2013&gt;1457) and the partisans of his opponent, King <a href="W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw_III_of_Poland" title="wikilink">Vladislaus I</a> (1440&lt;U+2013&gt;1444).<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> Between 1440 and 1458, the <a href="Diet_(assembly)" title="wikilink">Diet</a> was convoked in each year (with the exception of 1443 and 1449) and it was involved in the legislative process of law-making: the bills were passed by the Diet before receiving the <a href="Royal_Assent" title="wikilink">Royal Assent</a>.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> When the monarch (or the <a href="regent" class="uri" title="wikilink">regent</a>) convoked the Diet, he sent a personal invitation to the prelates, &quot;barons of the realm&quot; and &quot;magnates&quot; and they attended in person at the assembly, while other nobles were usually represented by their deputies.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> Consequently, the Diets were dominated by the &quot;magnates&quot; not only because of their personal presence, but also because of the tendency that the counties elected their partisans as their own delegates.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1445, the Diet elected seven <a href="Captain_General" title="wikilink">Captains General</a> (, ) in order to govern the kingdom during the absence of King Vladislaus I (who actually had fallen in the <a href="Battle_of_Varna" title="wikilink">Battle of Varna</a>).<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> In 1446, the assembly of the Estates proclaimed <a href="John_Hunyadi" title="wikilink">John Hunyadi</a> to Regent and he was to govern the realm in cooperation with the Estates until 1453 when King Ladislaus V returned to the kingdom.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>
<p>John Hunyadi was the first temporal &quot;magnate&quot; who received a hereditary title from a king of Hungary: in 1453, King Ladislaus V appointed him the hereditary head (, ) of <a href="Beszterce-Nasz&lt;U+00F3&gt;d" title="wikilink">Beszterce county</a> (now <em>Bistri&lt;U+0163&gt;a</em> in Romania) and thus he became a count in the sense similar to the title's usage in the western countries.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> Although, some of the immigrant &quot;magnates&quot;<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> had already used <a href="Title#Honorary_titles_granted_by_heads_of_state" title="wikilink">honorary titles</a> before and they were often mentioned even in official documents with a reference to their title,<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> but their title was granted by foreign monarchs and the public law in the Kingdom of Hungary did not recognize any special privileges connected to it.</p>
