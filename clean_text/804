Warren Stacey (born Warren Jituboh)1 is a British singer from London who came into prominence on the UK television show Popstars, the reality programme that created the pop band Hear'Say. Despite not making it into the group, Stacey went on to be signed by Def Jam Recordings and released his debut single &quot;My Girl My Girl&quot; in March 2002, which made Number 26 on the UK Singles Chart.
Life and music career
Stacey's first experience of performing music was singing in a church choir at a young age.2 In 2001, while working at a London branch of NatWest,3 he auditioned to become a member of Hear'Say, the pop group that was being formed from the reality television programme Popstars. He impressed the show's judges with a rendition of &quot;Angels&quot; by Robbie Williams and progressed on to the &quot;boot camp&quot; stage of the competition. During the second day of boot camp, Stacey opted to perform a hymn rather than a pop song for the judges. Nigel Lythgoe, one of the show's judges, informed him that the final band was obviously not going to perform hymns and that, at that stage in the competition, the judges were looking for small reasons such as this to eliminate contestants. However, Stacey's part in a group performance of &quot;Monday, Monday&quot; by The Mamas &amp; the Papas was seen as sufficient enough to keep him in the competition for another day.

Stacey was ultimately eliminated from the Popstars competition on the fourth day of boot camp. Within weeks of his elimination, he was signed by Def Jam Recordings,45 who flew him to Los Angeles to write and record his debut single &quot;My Girl My Girl&quot; with production team Red Zone.6 The single was released in March 2002 and peaked at Number 26 on the UK Singles Chart.7 Stacey's sound was compared to that of fellow British R&amp;B singer, Craig David.8 Stacey provided support at the final night of MTV's Five Night Stand in April9 and went on to support Destiny's Child on their UK tour in June.10
