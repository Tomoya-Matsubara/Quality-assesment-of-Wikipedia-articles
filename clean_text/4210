 The Codex Marianus is an Old Church Slavonic fourfold Gospel Book written in Glagolitic script, dated to the beginning of 11th century,1 which is (along with Codex Zographensis), one of the oldest manuscript witnesses to the Old Church Slavonic language, one of the two fourfold gospels being part of the Old Church Slavonic canon.
Name
The manuscript is known by its Latin name Codex Marianus, given by V. Grigorovi&lt;U+010D&gt;, after its discover in a hermitage of the the Monastery of the Holy Mother of God. In , , .
History
According to F. Curta, the book was &quot;certainly of Macedonian origin&quot;, written &quot;either in Ohrid or in one of the monastic centers in the region.&quot;2 According to H. G. Lunt, &quot;Certain deviations from the theoretical norms indicate Macedonian influences, others possibly Serbian (if not northern Macedonian)&quot;.3 According to Hanne Eckhoff the Codex is of Macedonian origin, probably written in the Ohrid Literary School.4 It is difficult to answer whether the Codex was created before the end of the First Bulgarian Empire (1018), or after its Byzantine conquest, i.e. into the theme of Bulgaria.5 Lunt proposed the 1030s.6
Most of the Codex (172 folios, 171 according to some sources) was discovered by Viktor Grigorovi&lt;U+010D&gt; at Mount Athos during a journey to the Balkans in 1844-45, in a hermitage belonging to the Monastery of the Holy Mother of God (the Blessed Theotokos), and thus the manuscript was named Codex Marianus in Latin. Grigorovi&lt;U+010D&gt; took the found folios to Kazan', and after his death in 1876 the Codex was transferred to Russian State Library in Moscow where it carries the catalog number &lt;U+0433&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0433&gt; 6 (M.1689). Croatian diplomat and amateur scholar Antun Mihanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; acquired 2 folios (containing Matthew 5.23 - 6.16) some time before Grigorovi&lt;U+010D&gt; made his discovery, and sent it to renowned Slovene Slavist Franc Miklo&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+010D&gt;, who had them published in 1850. After Miklo&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+010D&gt;'s death, the two-folio fragment was deposited in the Austrian National Library in Vienna under the catalog number Cod. Slav. 146.
The Codex was first published by Croatian Slavist Vatroslav Jagi&lt;U+0107&gt; in 1883 in Saint Petersburg as Quattuor Evangeliorum versionis palaeoslovenicae Codex Marianus Glagoliticus, transcribed in Cyrllic and with extensive philological commentary in Latin. Reprint was published in Graz in 1960.
Linguistical analyzation
Analysing the language of the Codex it has been ascertained that one of the scribes of the Codex came from &lt;U+0160&gt;tokavian area, namely the one under Eastern-rite. On the basis of substitutions u - &lt;U+01EB&gt;, i - y, u - v&lt;U+044A&gt;, e - &lt;U+0119&gt; etc. Jagi&lt;U+0107&gt; deduced that the manuscript could have originated on Croatian area or Serbian area (cf. characteristis of Croatian recension and Serbian recension), but Josip Hamm warns that vocalization of yers (&lt;U+044A&gt; &gt; o, &lt;U+044C&gt; &gt; e), as well as the occasional disappearance of epenthetic l, suggests Macedonian provenience. Text of Codex especially abounds with the usage of asigmatic aorist, and very frequent is the assimilation of vowels in compound adjectival declension and present forms (-aago, -uumu instead of -aego, -uemu; -aat&lt;U+044A&gt; instead of -aet&lt;U+044A&gt; etc.).
Legacy
The book is enumerated in Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian7 historical literary corpus.
Codex forms the base text for the scientific edition of the Slavonic gospels in the series Novum Testamentum Palaeoslovenice.
