Polio had existed for thousands of years quietly as an endemic epidemiology endemic pathogen until the 1880s, when major epidemics began to occur in Europe; soon after, widespread epidemics appeared in the United States.

By 1910, much of the world experienced a dramatic increase in polio cases and epidemics became regular events, primarily in cities during the summer months.

The term poliomyelitis is used to identify the disease caused by any of the three Serovar serotypes of poliovirus. Two basic patterns of polio infection are described: a minor illness which does not involve the central nervous system CNS, sometimes called abortive poliomyelitis, and a major illness involving the CNS, which may be paralytic or nonparalytic.cite journal  author=Falconer M, Bollenbach E  title=Late functional loss in nonparalytic polio  journal=American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation / Association of Academic Physiatrists  volume=79  issue=1  pages=1923  year=2000  pmid=10678598  doi=10.1097/00002060-200001000-00006 In most people with a immunocompetent normal immune system, a poliovirus infection is Subclinical infection asymptomatic. Rarely, the infection produces minor symptoms; these may include upper respiratory tract infection Pharyngitis sore throat and fever, gastrointestinal tract gastrointestinal disturbances nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation or, rarely, diarrhea, and influenza-like illness.

The virus enters the central nervous system in about 3% of infections. Most patients with CNS involvement develop nonparalytic aseptic meningitis, with symptoms of headache, neck, back, abdominal and extremity pain, fever, vomiting, lethargy, and irritability.cite book   author=Leboeuf C   title=The late effects of Polio: Information For Health Care Providers.   url = http://www.health.qld.gov.au/polio/gp/GP_Manual.pdf  format=PDF   publisher=Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health  year = 1992  isbn=1-875412-05-0  accessdate=2008-08-23 archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080625212726/http://www.health.qld.gov.au/polio/gp/GP_Manual.pdf  archivedate = June 25, 2008 deadurl=yes About one to five in 1000 cases progress to paralytic disease, in which the muscles become weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and, finally, completely paralyzed; this condition is known as Flaccid paralysis acute flaccid paralysis.  Depending on the site of paralysis, paralytic poliomyelitis is classified as spinal, bulbar, or bulbospinal. Encephalitis, an infection of the brain tissue itself, can occur in rare cases, and is usually restricted to infants. It is characterized by confusion, changes in mental status, headaches, fever, and, less commonly, seizures and spastic paralysis.cite book  author=Wood, Lawrence D.

 Cause 
main Poliovirus
File:Polio EM PHIL 1875 lores.PNG thumb right A Transmission electron microscopy TEM micrograph of poliovirus

Poliomyelitis is caused by infection with a member of the genus Enterovirus known as poliovirus PV. This group of RNA viruses colonize the gastrointestinal tract  specifically the oropharynx and the intestine. The incubation time to the first signs and symptoms ranges from three to 35 days, with a more common span of six to 20 days. PV pathogen infects and causes disease in humans alone. Its Virus structure structure is very simple, composed of a single sense molecular biology + sense RNA genome enclosed in a protein shell called a capsid. In addition to protecting the viruss genetic material, the capsid proteins enable poliovirus to infect certain types of cells. Three serovar serotypes of poliovirus have been identifiedpoliovirus type 1 PV1, type 2 PV2, and type 3 PV3each with a slightly different capsid protein.cite book  author=Katz, Samuel L.; Gershon, Anne A.; Krugman, Saul; Hotez, Peter J.  title=Krugman's infectious diseases of children  publisher=Mosby  location=St. Louis  year=2004  pages=8197  isbn=0-323-01756-8  All three are extremely virulence virulent and produce the same disease symptoms. PV1 is the most commonly encountered form, and the one most closely associated with paralysis.

Individuals who are exposed to the virus, either through infection or by immunization with polio vaccine, develop immunity medical immunity.  In immune individuals, IgA antibodies against poliovirus are present in the tonsils and gastrointestinal tract, and are able to block virus replication; IgG and IgM antibodies against PV can prevent the spread of the virus to motor neurons of the central nervous system. Infection or vaccination with one serotype of poliovirus does not provide immunity against the other serotypes, and full immunity requires exposure to each serotype.

A rare condition with a similar presentation, nonpoliovirus poliomyelitis, may result from infections with nonpoliovirus enteroviruses.cite journal  author=Gorson KC, Ropper AH  title=Nonpoliovirus poliomyelitis simulating Guillain-Barr syndrome  journal=Archives of Neurology  volume=58  issue=9  pages=14604  year=2001  month=September  pmid=11559319  doi= 10.1001/archneur.58.9.1460 url=http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11559319

 Pathophysiology 
File:Polio spine.png thumb left A blockage of the lumbar anterior spinal cord artery due to polio PV3

Poliovirus enters the body through the mouth, infecting the first cells with which it comes in contact  the human pharynx pharynx and intestinal mucosa. It gains entry by binding to an Immunoglobulin immunoglobulin-like receptor, known as the poliovirus receptor or CD155, on the cell membrane.cite journal  author=He Y, Mueller S, Chipman P, et al.  title=Complexes of Poliovirus Serotypes with Their Common Cellular Receptor, CD155   url= http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/full/77/8/4827?view=long&pmid=12663789  journal=Journal of Virology J Virol  volume=77  issue=8  pages = 482735  year=2003  pmid = 12663789  doi=10.1128/JVI.77.8.4827-4835.2003  pmc=152153 The virus then hijacks the Host biology host cell's own machinery, and begins to viral replication replicate. Poliovirus divides within gastrointestinal cells for about a week, from where it spreads to the tonsils specifically the follicular dendritic cells residing within the tonsilar germinal centers, the intestinal lymphoid tissue including the M cells of Peyer's patches, and the deep Cervical lymph nodes cervical and Inferior mesenteric lymph nodes mesenteric lymph nodes, where it multiplies abundantly. The virus is subsequently absorbed into the bloodstream.cite book   author =  Yin-Murphy M, Almond JW   chapter = Picornaviruses: The Enteroviruses: Polioviruses   title = Baron's Medical Microbiology Baron S et al., eds.  edition = 4th    publisher = Univ of Texas Medical Branch   year = 1996  url= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.2862   isbn = 0-9631172-1-1 

Known as viremia, the presence of virus in the bloodstream enables it to be widely distributed throughout the body. Poliovirus can survive and multiply within the blood and lymphatics for long periods of time, sometimes as long as 17 weeks.cite web  author = Todar K   title = Polio   work = Ken Todar's Microbial World   publisher = University of Wisconsin - Madison    year = 2006   url=http://textbookofbacteriology.net/themicrobialworld/Polio.html   accessdate = 2007-04-23 In a small percentage of cases, it can spread and replicate in other sites, such as brown fat, the reticuloendothelial tissues, and muscle.cite journal  author=Sabin A  title=Pathogenesis of poliomyelitis; reappraisal in the light of new data  journal=Science journal Science  volume=123  issue=3209  pages=11517  year=1956  pmid=13337331  doi=10.1126/science.123.3209.1151 This sustained replication causes a major viremia, and leads to the development of minor influenza-like symptoms. Rarely, this may progress and the virus may invade the central nervous system, provoking a local inflammatory response. In most cases, this causes a self-limiting inflammation of the meninges, the layers of tissue surrounding the Human brain brain, which is known as nonparalytic aseptic meningitis. Penetration of the CNS provides no known benefit to the virus, and is quite possibly an incidental deviation of a normal gastrointestinal infection.cite journal  author=Mueller S, Wimmer E, Cello J  title=Poliovirus and poliomyelitis: a tale of guts, brains, and an accidental event  journal=Virus Res  volume=111  issue=2  pages=17593  year=2005  pmid = 15885840   doi = 10.1016/j.virusres.2005.04.008 The mechanisms by which poliovirus spreads to the CNS are poorly understood, but it appears to be primarily a chance eventlargely independent of the age, gender, or Socioeconomics socioeconomic position of the individual.

 Paralytic polio 
File:PHIL 2767 Poliovirus Myotonic dystrophic changes.jpg thumb right Denervation of skeletal muscle tissue secondary to poliovirus infection can lead to paralysis.

In around 1% of infections, poliovirus spreads along certain nerve fiber pathways, preferentially replicating in and destroying motor neurons within the spinal cord, brain stem, or motor cortex. This leads to the development of paralytic poliomyelitis, the various forms of which spinal, bulbar, and bulbospinal vary only with the amount of neuronal damage and inflammation that occurs, and the region of the CNS affected.

The destruction of neuronal cells produces lesions within the Dorsal root ganglion spinal ganglia; these may also occur in the reticular formation, vestibular nuclei, cerebellar vermis, and deep cerebellar nuclei.  Inflammation associated with Neuron nerve cell destruction often alters the color and appearance of the gray matter in the spinal column, causing it to appear reddish and swollen. Other destructive changes associated with paralytic disease occur in the forebrain region, specifically the hypothalamus and thalamus. The molecular mechanisms by which poliovirus causes paralytic disease are poorly understood.

Early symptoms of paralytic polio include high fever, headache, stiffness in the back and neck, asymmetrical weakness of various muscles, sensitivity to touch, Dysphagia difficulty swallowing, Myalgia muscle pain, loss of superficial and deep reflexes, paresthesia pins and needles, irritability, constipation, or difficulty urinating. Paralysis generally develops one to ten days after early symptoms begin, progresses for two to three days, and is usually complete by the time the fever breaks.cite book  author = Silverstein A, Silverstein V, Nunn LS  title=Polio   series = Diseases and People    publisher=Enslow Publishers  location=Berkeley Heights, NJ  year=2001  isbn=0-7660-1592-0  page= 12 

The likelihood of developing paralytic polio increases with age, as does the extent of paralysis. In children, nonparalytic meningitis is the most likely consequence of CNS involvement, and paralysis occurs in only one in 1000 cases. In adults, paralysis occurs in one in 75 cases.cite journal   author = Gawne AC, Halstead LS   title = Post-polio syndrome: pathophysiology and clinical management   journal = Critical Review in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation    year = 1995   volume = 7   pages = 14788   url = http://www.ott.zynet.co.uk/polio/lincolnshire/library/gawne/ppspandcm-s00.html Reproduced online with permission by Lincolnshire Post-Polio Library; retrieved on 2007-11-10.

Spinal polio, the most common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral invasion of the motor neurons of the Anterior horn spinal cord anterior horn cells, or the ventral front grey matter section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those of the torso trunk, limb anatomy limbs, and the intercostal muscles.cite book   author = Frauenthal HWA, Manning JVV   title = Manual of infantile paralysis, with modern methods of treatment.  publisher = Philadelphia Davis   year = 1914  pages= 79101  url= http://books.google.com/?id=piyLQnuT-1YC&printsec=titlepage   oclc=  2078290 Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglion ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain or spinal cord; without nerve stimulation, the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Progression to maximum paralysis is rapid two to four days, and is usually associated with fever and muscle pain.cite book   author = Cono J, Alexander LN   chapter = Chapter 10, Poliomyelitis.   title = Vaccine Preventable Disease Surveillance Manual   edition = 3rd   pages = 101   publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   year = 2002  url=http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/3rd-edition-chpt10_polio.pdf   format = PDF Deep Stretch reflex tendon reflexes are also affected, and are usually absent or diminished; Wikt:sensation sensation the ability to feel in the paralyzed limbs, however, is not affected.

File:Brain bulbar region.svg thumb right The location and anatomy of the bulbar region in orange

Making up about 2% of cases of paralytic polio, bulbar polio occurs when poliovirus invades and destroys nerves within the bulbar region of the brain stem. The bulbar region is a white matter pathway that connects the cerebral cortex to the brain stem. The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves, producing symptoms of encephalitis, and causes Dyspnea difficulty breathing, speaking and swallowing. Critical nerves affected are the glossopharyngeal nerve which partially controls swallowing and functions in the throat, tongue movement, and taste, the vagus nerve which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs, and the accessory nerve which controls upper neck movement. Due to the effect on swallowing, secretions of mucus may build up in the airway, causing suffocation. Other signs and symptoms include facial weakness caused by destruction of the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve, which innervate the cheeks, tear ducts, gums, and muscles of the face, among other structures, diplopia double vision, difficulty in chewing, and abnormal respiratory rate, depth, and rhythm which may lead to respiratory arrest. Pulmonary edema and shock circulatory shock are also possible and may be fatal.

= Bulbospinal polio =
Approximately 19% of all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called respiratory or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects the upper part of the cervical spinal cord cervical vertebrae C3 through C5, and paralysis of the Thoracic diaphragm diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve which drives the diaphragm to inflate the human lung lungs and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a medical ventilator ventilator. It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.

 Diagnosis 
Paralytic poliomyelitis may be clinically suspected in individuals experiencing acute onset of flaccid paralysis in one or more limbs with decreased or absent tendon reflexes in the affected limbs that cannot be attributed to another apparent cause, and without sensory or cognitive loss.cite journal  title=Case definitions for infectious conditions under public health surveillance. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  url= ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Publications/mmwr/rr/rr4610.pdf  format=PDF journal= Morbidity and mortality weekly report  volume=46  issue=RR10  pages=267  year=1997  pmid=9148133 

A laboratory diagnosis is usually made based on recovery of poliovirus from a stool sample or a swab of the human pharynx pharynx. antibody Antibodies to poliovirus can be diagnostic, and are generally detected in the blood of infected patients early in the course of infection. Analysis of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid CSF, which is collected by a lumbar puncture spinal tap, reveals an increased number of white blood cells primarily lymphocytes and a mildly elevated protein level. Detection of virus in the CSF is diagnostic of paralytic polio, but rarely occurs.

If poliovirus is isolated from a patient experiencing acute flaccid paralysis, it is further tested through oligonucleotide mapping genetic fingerprinting, or more recently by polymerase chain reaction PCR amplification, to determine whether it is wild type that is, the virus encountered in nature or vaccine type derived from a strain of poliovirus used to produce polio vaccine.cite journal  author=Chezzi C  title=Rapid diagnosis of poliovirus infection by PCR amplification  pmc=229102   journal=Journal of Clinical Microbiology J Clin Microbiol  volume=34  issue=7  pages=17225  pmid=8784577  year=1996   month=July  It is important to determine the source of the virus because for each reported case of paralytic polio caused by wild poliovirus, an estimated 200 to 3,000  other contagious asymptomatic carriers exist.cite journal  authorlink = Atul Gawande  author= Gawande A   title = The mop-up: eradicating polio from the planet, one child at a time   work = The New Yorker   issn = 0028-792X   pages = 3440   date = 2004-01-12

 Prevention 

 Passive immunization 
In 1950, William Hammon at the University of Pittsburgh purified the gamma globulin component of the blood plasma of polio survivors.cite journal  author=Hammon W  title=Passive immunization against poliomyelitis  journal=Monogr Ser World Health Organ  volume=26  issue=  pages=35770  year = 1955  pmid=14374581  Hammon proposed the gamma globulin, which contained antibodies to poliovirus, could be used to halt poliovirus infection, prevent disease, and reduce the severity of disease in other patients who had contracted polio. The results of a large clinical trial were promising; the gamma globulin was shown to be about 80% effective in preventing the development of paralytic poliomyelitis.cite journal  author=Hammon W, Coriell L, Ludwig E, et al.  title=Evaluation of Red Cross gamma globulin as a prophylactic agent for poliomyelitis. 5.

The gamma globulin approach was later deemed impractical for widespread use, however, due in large part to the limited supply of blood plasma, so the medical community turned its focus to the development of a polio vaccine.cite journal  author=Rinaldo C  title=Passive Immunization Against Poliomyelitis: The Hammon Gamma Globulin Field Trials, 19511953  journal=American Journal of Public Health Am J Public Health  volume=95  issue=5  pages=7909  year=2005  pmid=15855454  doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.040790  pmc=1449257

 Vaccine 
main Polio vaccine
File:Poliodrops.jpg thumb right A child receiving an oral polio vaccine

Two types of vaccine are used throughout the world to combat polio. Both types induce immunity to polio, efficiently blocking person-to-person transmission of wild poliovirus, thereby protecting both individual vaccine recipients and the wider community so-called herd immunity.cite journal  author=Fine P, Carneiro I  title=Transmissibility and persistence of oral polio vaccine viruses: implications for the global poliomyelitis eradication initiative  url= http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/150/10/1001  journal=Am J Epidemiol  volume=150  issue=10  pages=100121  date=15 November 1999 pmid=10568615  doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009924 

The first candidate polio vaccine, based on one serotype of a live but attenuated vaccine attenuated weakened virus, was developed by the virologist Hilary Koprowski. Koprowski's prototype vaccine was given to an eight-year-old boy on February 27, 1950.cite web url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/polio   title = Interview with Hilary Koprowski, sourced at History of Vaccines website   first=Hilary  last=Koprowski   date=15 October 2010   accessdate=15 October 2010  publisher=College of Physicians of Philadelphia Koprowski continued to work on the vaccine throughout the 1950s, leading to large-scale trials in the then Belgian Congo and the vaccination of seven million children in Poland against serotypes PV1 and PV3 between 1958 and 1960.http://web.archive.org/web/20071007095443/http://www.polio.info/polio-eradication/front/templates/index.jsp?siteCode=POLIO&codeRubrique=34&lang=EN Sanofi Pasteur Inc: Competition to develop an oral vaccine Accessed 2009-12-16.

The second inactivated virus vaccine was developed in 1952 by Jonas Salk at the University of Pittsburgh, and announced to the world on April 12, 1955.cite news   author = Spice B  title=Tireless polio research effort bears fruit and indignation  url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05094/482468.stm  work=The Salk vaccine: 50 years later/ second of two parts  publisher= Pittsburgh Post-Gazette date= April 4, 2005  accessdate= 2008-08-23  The Salk vaccine, or inactivated poliovirus vaccine IPV, is based on poliovirus grown in a type of monkey kidney tissue culture vero cell cell culture line, which is chemically inactivated with formalin. After two doses of IPV given by injection medicine injection, 90% or more of individuals develop protective antibody to all three serotypes of poliovirus, and at least 99% are immune to poliovirus following three doses.

Subsequently, Albert Sabin developed another live, oral polio vaccine OPV. It was produced by the repeated passage of the virus through nonhuman cells at subphysiological temperatures.cite journal   author = Sabin AB, Boulger LR   title = History of Sabin attenuated poliovirus oral live vaccine strains   journal = J Biol Stand   year = 1973   volume = 1   pages = 1158   doi=10.1016/0092-11577390048-6   issue = 2 The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of wild poliovirus infection and replication, but the vaccine strain is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue.cite journal  author=Sabin A, Ramos-Alvarez M, Alvarez-Amezquita J, et al.  title=Live, orally given poliovirus vaccine.

Three doses of live-attenuated OPV produce protective antibody to all three poliovirus types in more than 95% of recipients. Clinical trial Human trials of Sabin's vaccine began in 1957,cite web   title = A Science Odyssey: People and Discoveries   publisher = PBS   year = 1998   url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dm52sa.html   accessdate = 2008-08-23 and in 1958 it was selected, in competition with the live vaccines of Koprowski and other researchers, by the US National Institutes of Health. Licensed in 1962, it rapidly became the only polio vaccine used worldwide.

Because OPV is inexpensive, easy to administer, and produces excellent immunity in the intestine which helps prevent infection with wild virus in areas where it is Endemic epidemiology endemic, it has been the vaccine of choice for controlling poliomyelitis in many countries.cite journal  author=  title=Poliomyelitis prevention: recommendations for use of inactivated poliovirus vaccine and live oral poliovirus vaccine.

 Treatment 
There is no cure for polio. The focus of modern treatment has been on providing relief of symptoms, speeding recovery and preventing complications. Supportive measures include antibiotics to prevent infections in weakened muscles, analgesics for pain, moderate exercise and a nutritious diet.cite book  author=Daniel, Thomas M.; Robbins, Frederick C.  title=Polio  publisher=University of Rochester Press  location=Rochester, N.Y., USA  year= 1997  pages= 810  isbn=1-58046-066-6  Treatment of polio often requires long-term rehabilitation, including occupational therapy, physical therapy, braces, corrective shoes and, in some cases, orthopedic surgery.

Portable ventilators may be required to support breathing. Historically, a noninvasive, negative-pressure ventilator, more commonly called an Negative pressure ventilator iron lung, was used to artificially maintain respiration during an acute polio infection until a person could breathe independently generally about one to two weeks. Today, many polio survivors with permanent respiratory paralysis use modern Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation jacket-type negative-pressure ventilators worn over the chest and abdomen.

Other History of poliomyelitis#Historical treatments historical treatments for polio include hydrotherapy, electrotherapy, massage and passive motion exercises, and surgical treatments, such as tendon lengthening and nerve grafting.

 Prognosis 
Patients with abortive polio infections recover completely. In those who develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms can be expected to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset.cite journal  author=Neumann D  title=Polio: its impact on the people of the United States and the emerging profession of physical therapy  url= http://www.post-polio.org/edu/hpros/Aug04HistPersNeumann.pdf   format = PDF   journal=The Journal of orthopaedic and sports physical therapy  volume=34  issue=8  pages=47992  year=2004  pmid=15373011 Reproduced online with permission by Post-Polio Health International; retrieved on 2007-11-10.

 Recovery 
Many cases of poliomyelitis result in only temporary paralysis. Nerve impulses return to the formerly paralyzed muscle within a month, and recovery is usually complete in six to eight months. The neurophysiology neurophysiological processes involved in recovery following acute paralytic poliomyelitis are quite effective; muscles are able to retain normal strength even if half the original motor neurons have been lost.cite journal  author=Sandberg A, Hansson B, Stlberg E  title=Comparison between concentric needle EMG and macro EMG in patients with a history of polio  journal=Clinical Neurophysiology  volume=110  issue=11  pages=19008  year=1999  pmid=10576485  doi=10.1016/S1388-24579900150-9 Paralysis remaining after one year is likely to be permanent, although modest recoveries of muscle strength are possible 12 to 18 months after infection.

One mechanism involved in recovery is nerve terminal sprouting, in which remaining brainstem and spinal cord motor neurons develop new branches, or axonal sprouts.cite journal  author=Cashman NR, Covault J, Wollman RL, Sanes JR  title=Neural cell adhesion molecule in normal, denervated, and myopathic human muscle  journal=Ann. Neurol.  volume=21  issue=5  pages=4819  year=1987  pmid=3296947  doi=10.1002/ana.410210512 These sprouts can reinnervate orphaned muscle fibers that have been denervated by acute polio infection,cite journal  author=Agre JC, Rodrquez AA, Tafel JA  title=Late effects of polio: critical review of the literature on neuromuscular function  journal=Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation  volume=72  issue=11  pages=92331  year=1991  pmid=1929813  doi=10.1016/0003-99939190013-9 restoring the fibers' capacity to contract and improving strength.cite journal  author=Trojan DA, Cashman NR  title=Post-poliomyelitis syndrome  journal=Muscle Nerve  volume=31  issue=1  pages=619  year=2005  pmid=15599928  doi=10.1002/mus.20259 Terminal sprouting may generate a few significantly enlarged motor neurons doing work previously performed by as many as four or five units: a single motor neuron that once controlled 200 muscle cells might control 800 to 1000 cells. Other mechanisms that occur during the rehabilitation phase, and contribute to muscle strength restoration, include muscle hypertrophy myofiber hypertrophyenlargement of muscle fibers through exercise and activityand transformation of Muscle fiber#Type II type II muscle fibers to Muscle fiber#Type I type I muscle fibers.cite journal  author=Grimby G, Einarsson G, Hedberg M, Aniansson A  title=Muscle adaptive changes in post-polio subjects  journal=Scandinavian journal of rehabilitation medicine  volume=21  issue=1  pages=1926  year=1989  pmid=2711135

In addition to these physiological processes, the body possesses a number of compensatory mechanisms to maintain function in the presence of residual paralysis. These include the use of weaker muscles at a higher than usual intensity relative to the Muscle contraction#Contractions, by muscle type muscle's maximal capacity, enhancing athletic development of previously little-used muscles, and using ligaments for stability, which enables greater mobility.

 Complications 
Residual complications of paralytic polio often occur following the initial recovery process. Muscle paresis and paralysis can sometimes result in skeletal deformities, tightening of the joints and movement disability. Once the muscles in the limb become flaccid, they may interfere with the function of other muscles. A typical manifestation of this problem is equinus foot similar to club foot. This deformity develops when the muscles that pull the toes downward are working, but those that pull it upward are not, and the foot naturally tends to drop toward the ground. If the problem is left untreated, the Achilles tendons at the back of the foot retract and the foot cannot take on a normal position. Polio victims that develop equinus foot cannot walk properly because they cannot put their heel on the ground. A similar situation can develop if the arms become paralyzed.cite web   author = Sanofi Pasteur   title = Poliomyelitis virus picornavirus, enterovirus, after-effects of the polio, paralysis, deformations   work = Polio Eradication   url = http://www.polio.info/polio-eradication/front/index.jsp?siteCode=POLIO&lang=EN&codeRubrique=14   accessdate = 2008-08-23 archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071007100336/http://www.polio.info/polio-eradication/front/index.jsp?siteCode=POLIO&lang=EN&codeRubrique=14  archivedate = October 7, 2007 deadurl=yes In some cases the growth of an affected leg is slowed by polio, while the other leg continues to grow normally. The result is that one leg is shorter than the other and the person limps and leans to one side, in turn leading to deformities of the spine such as scoliosis. Osteoporosis and increased likelihood of bone fractures may occur. An intervention to prevent or lessen length disparity can be to perform an epiphysiodesis on the distal femoral and proximal tibial/fibular condyles, so that limb's growth is artificially stunted, and by the time of epiphyseal plate epiphyseal growth plate closure, the legs are more equal in length. Other surgery to re-balance muscular agonist/antagonist imbalances may also be helpful.  Extended use of braces or wheelchairs may cause compression neuropathy, as well as a loss of proper function of the veins in the legs, due to pooling of blood in paralyzed lower limbs.cite book  author=Hoyt, William Graves; Miller, Neil; Walsh, Frank  title=Walsh and Hoyt's clinical neuro-ophthalmology  publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins  location=Hagerstown, MD  year=2005  pages=326465  isbn=0-7817-4814-3 cite web  author = Mayo Clinic Staff   date=2005-05-19   url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/polio/DS00572/DSECTION=complications    title = Polio: Complications  publisher = Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research MFMER  accessdate=2007-02-26 Complications from prolonged immobility involving the lungs, kidneys and heart include pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, paralytic ileus, myocarditis and cor pulmonale.

PPS is a slow, progressive disease, and there is no specific treatment for it. Post-polio syndrome is not an infectious process, and persons experiencing the syndrome do not shed poliovirus.

The effects of polio have been known since prehistory; Ancient Egypt Egyptian paintings and carvings depict otherwise healthy people with withered limbs, and children walking with canes at a young age.  The first clinical description was provided by the English physician Michael Underwood in 1789, where he refers to polio as a debility of the lower extremities.cite book   last = Underwood   first = Michael   title = Debility of the lower extremities.

Before the 20th century, polio infections were rarely seen in infants before six months of age, most cases occurring in children six months to four years of age.cite web   author =  Robertson S   title = Module 6: Poliomyelitis   work = The Immunological Basis for Immunization Series  publisher = World Health Organization.

In developed countries during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, improvements were made in community sanitation, including better sewage disposal and clean water supplies. These changes drastically increased the proportion of children and adults at risk of paralytic polio infection, by reducing childhood exposure and immunity to the disease.

Small localized paralytic polio epidemics began to appear in Europe and the United States around 1900.cite journal  author=Trevelyan B, Smallman-Raynor M, Cliff A  title=The Spatial Dynamics of Poliomyelitis in the United States: From Epidemic Emergence to Vaccine-Induced Retreat, 19101971  pmc=1473032  journal=Ann Assoc Am Geogr  volume=95  issue=2  pages=26993  year=2005  pmid=16741562  doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.2005.00460.x Outbreaks reached pandemic proportions in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand during the first half of the 20th century. By 1950 the peak age incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis in the United States had shifted from infants to children aged five to nine years, when the risk of paralysis is greater; about one-third of the cases were reported in persons over 15 years of age.cite book   author = Melnick JL   title =   Poliomyelitis.

The polio epidemics changed not only the lives of those who survived them, but also affected profound cultural changes; spurring grassroots fund-raising campaigns that would revolutionize medical philanthropy, and give rise to the modern field of Physical therapy rehabilitation therapy. As one of the largest disabled groups in the world, polio survivors also helped to advance the modern disability rights movement through campaigns for the social and civil rights of the disabled. The World Health Organization estimates that there are 10 to 20 million polio survivors worldwide.cite web   title = After Effects of Polio Can Harm Survivors 40 Years Later   publisher = March of Dimes   url = http://www.marchofdimes.com/aboutus/791_1718.asp   date = 2001-06-01   accessdate = 2008-08-23 In 1977 there were 254,000 persons living in the United States who had been paralyzed by polio.cite journal   author = Frick NM, Bruno RL   title = Post-polio sequelae: physiological and psychological overview   journal = Rehabilitation literature   volume = 47   issue = 56   pages = 10611   year = 1986   pmid = 3749588  According to doctors and local polio support groups, some 40,000 polio survivors with varying degrees of paralysis live in Germany, 30,000 in Japan, 24,000 in France, 16,000 in Australia, 12,000 in Canada and 12,000 in the United Kingdom.

The disease was very well publicized during the polio epidemics of the 1950s, with extensive media coverage of any scientific advancements that might lead to a cure. Thus, the scientists working on polio became some of the most famous of the century. Fifteen scientists and two laymen who made important contributions to the knowledge and treatment of poliomyelitis are honored by the Polio Hall of Fame, which was dedicated in 1957 at the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation in Warm Springs, Georgia, US. In 2008 four organizations Rotary International, the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and UNICEF were added to the Hall of Fame.cite news   first=Winston   last=Skinner   coauthors=  authorlink=   title=Four added to Polio Hall of Fame at Warm Springs   date=2008-11-15   publisher=   url =http://www.times-herald.com/Local/Four-added-to-Polio-Hall-of-Fame-at-Warm-Springs-589785   work =The Times-Herald Newnan, GA   pages =   accessdate = 2009-05-29   language = cite news   first=   last=   coauthors=  authorlink=   title=CDC Inducted into Polio Hall of Fame   date=2009-01-23   publisher=   url =http://www.cdc.gov/news/2009/01/polio_hof/   work =CDC In the News   pages =   accessdate =   language = 

World Polio Day October 24 was established by Rotary International to commemorate the birth of Jonas Salk, who led the first team to develop a vaccine against poliomyelitis. Use of this inactivated poliovirus vaccine and subsequent widespread use of the oral poliovirus vaccine developed by Albert Sabin led to establishment of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative GPEI in 1988. Since then, GPEI has reduced polio worldwide by 99%.cite web  url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6141a6.htm  title=Announcement: World Polio Day  October 24, 2012  last1=  first1=  last2=  first2=  date=19 October 2012  website=CDC  publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  accessdate=December 7, 2013
