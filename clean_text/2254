Life and career
Gorell was the second son of John Gorell Barnes, 1st Baron Gorell, President of the Probate Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice.
Gorell was educated at Winchester College, Harrow School and Balliol College, Oxford.1 While at Oxford, he played first-class cricket for the University cricket team. After leaving Oxford, Gorell played with MCC for 13 seasons, 431 runs and 43 wickets in his 19-match career. In 1909 he was admitted to Inner Temple, to practice as a barrister, and worked as a journalist for The Times from 1911 to 1915.2 During World War I he served in the Rifle Brigade, where he reached the rank of Captain, was mentioned in despatches and, in 1917, received the Military Cross.3
