The Pamunkey Indian Tribe Museum is a museum in King William, Virginia, that holds information on the Pamunkey people, their history and way of life.1
The museum was built in 1979 with the aim of preserving the people's inherited identity.2 When built, the intent was to show the houses of the ancient Pamunkey.3 It now displays 12,000 years of Indian artifacts to represent the Pamunkey people's history from Ice Age to present.4
The museum has followed a display model which combines replicas with original artifacts in order to provide a full and authentic view of the tribe's lifestyle. It is mainly the work of Warren Cook, an anthropologist, and Errett Callahan, an experimental archeologist. Callahan was the main responsible of the replicas. He also collected many artifacts.5

In People ornaments displayed show the way of life of the Pamunkeys at that time. Natural Environment and Settlement show the dwelling places, whereas Subsistence exhibits the tools they used and how they survived. The four themes show in this order in each archeological time frame, and are color-coded blue, green, yellow, and red respectively, in order to assist the visitor move with ease from one era to the other.6
