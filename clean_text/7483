Milford railway station is a stop on the Portsmouth Direct Line, serving the village of Milford, Surrey in England.
Services
There is an hourly service to  southbound and London Waterloo northbound.
At approximately level gradient but adjoining woodland the track occasionally suffers from leaves on the line resulting in poor traction for trains, in extremis leading to overshoots on stopping and difficulty moving off.   
Brief Encounter
The station has the same name as the fictional station in the film Brief Encounter (1945) starring Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson, although the scenes were filmed at Carnforth station in Lancashire.
