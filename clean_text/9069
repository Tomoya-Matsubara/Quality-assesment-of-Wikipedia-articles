Decline and fall
During the 1880s, Brazil continued to prosper. Social diversity increased markedly, including the first organized push for women's rights.1 The country had greatly changed in the five decades since Pedro II's accession to the throne. The liberalism adopted by successive Government cabinets favored private initiatives and resulted in decades of economic prosperity.2 Brazil's international trade reached a total value of Rs 79.000:000$000 (see Brazilian currency) between 1834 and 1839. This continued to increase every year until it reached Rs 472.000:000$000 between 1886 and 1887 (an annual growth rate of 3.88% since 1839).3 Brazilian economic growth, especially after 1850, compared well with that of the United States and European nations.4 The national revenue, which amounted to Rs 11.795:000$000 in 1831, rose to Rs 160.840:000$000 in 1889. By 1858, it was the eighth largest in the world.5 The per capita income in 1880 was roughly equivalent to that of the United States.6 To give an idea of the economic potential of the country during the Empire, if &quot;it had been able to sustain the level of productivity achieved in 1780 and managed to increase exports at a pace equal to that verified in the second half of 19th century, its per capita income in 1950 would be comparable to the the average per capita income of the Western European nations&quot;.7  Development on an immense scale occurred during this period, which anticipated similar initiatives in European countries.89 In 1850, there were 50 factories valued at more than Rs 7.000:000$000. At the end of the Imperial period in 1889, Brazil had 636 factories (representing an annual rate of increase of 6.74% from 1850) valued at approximately Rs 401.630:600$000 (annual growth rate of 10.94% since 1850).10 The first railroad line with only 15 kilometers was opened on 30 April 185411 at a time when many European countries had no rail service.12 By 1868, there were 718 kilometers of railroad lines13, and by the end of the Empire in 1889, this had grown to 9,200 kilometers (with another 9,000 kilometers under construction).14 Brazil was the fifth country in the world to install modern sewers in cities, the third to have sewage treatment,15 and one of the pioneers in installing telephone lines.16 Beyond these, it was the first South American nation to adopt public electric illumination (in 1883)17 and the second in the Americas (behind the United States) to estabilish a telegraphic line connecting it directly to Europe (in 1874).18 The first telegraph line appeared in 1852 in Rio de Janeiro. By 1889, there were 18,925 kilometers of telegraph lines connecting the country's capital to distant Brazilian provinces such as Par&lt;U+00E1&gt;, and even linking to other South American countries such as Argentina and Uruguay.19
The Brazilian Empire was admired internationally for its democratic system and for its respect for freedom of speech.20 In politics there were &quot;solid and competitive parties, an active parliament, a free press, open debate&quot;.21 The Argentine President Bartolom&lt;U+00E9&gt; Mitre called the country a &quot;crowned democracy&quot; and Venezuelan President Rojas Pa&lt;U+00FA&gt;l after learning of the emperor's fall said, &quot;It has ended the only republic that existed in [South] America: the Empire of Brazil.&quot;22 The Brazil of the last year of Pedro II's reign was a &quot;prosperous and [internationally] respected&quot; nation23 which held unchallenged leadership in Latin America.24 Its navy was the fifth or sixth most powerful in the world in 188925 with the most powerful battleships in the western hemisphere.26 The Emperor was beloved by the Brazilian people27 and was regarded with &quot;respect, almost veneration&quot;28 in North America and Europe due to his democratic, liberal and progressive ideals and actions. The British Prime Minister William Gladstone said that Pedro II was &quot;a model to the Sovereigns of the world&quot; and held him as being a &quot;great and good Sovereign&quot;.29 Brazilian writer Machado de Assis would later remember him as &quot;a humble, honest, well-learned and patriotic man, who knew how to make of a throne a chair [for his simplicity], without diminishing its greatness and respect.&quot;30 When he became emperor in 1831, Brazil was on the verge of fragmentation. Fifty-eight years later, the country had been at peace for more than four decades, slavery had been extinguished, the representative system was consolidated, and the leadership of the military was in civilian hands (something not seen in the Spanish-American countries).31 Indeed, for &quot;the longevity of his government and the transformations which occurred during its course, no other Head of State has marked more deeply the history of the nation.&quot;32 Even though Brazil was richer and more powerful than ever, though it enjoyed an excellent international reputation, and though Pedro II himself was still extremely popular among his subjects, the Brazilian monarchy itself was dying.

Republicanism
Republicanism as an enduring political movement appeared in Brazil during December 1870 in Rio de Janeiro with the publishing of a manifesto signed by 57 people and with the creation of the Republican Club.333435 It represented an &quot;insignificant minority of scholars.&quot;36 There was no repudiation of or desire for eliminating slavery in the manifesto.37 In 1873, the Republican Party of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo was created, and it affirmed that slavery would have to be resolved by the monarchist (Conservative and Liberal) parties. The reason for this was because many of the republicans from S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo were themselves slave-owning farmers.38 The objective of most republicans was to wait until the death of Pedro II and by a plebiscite or other peaceful means, prevent Princess Isabel from ascending the throne.394041 Republicanism did not envisage any &quot;social readjustment&quot; (such as improving the quality of life for former-slaves), and they &quot;were not revolutionaries in the deep meaning of the word.&quot;42 The republican movement &quot;had a slow and irregular evolution, concentrated in the provinces south of Bahia&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;more precisely in the provinces of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul.43 It was &quot;an extremely small group&quot;44 with a &quot;precarious organization in the provinces&quot;45 and no cohesion or connection among themselves.46 The only republican faction to achieve political clout was the Republican Party of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo, which managed to elect two deputies to the Chamber of Deputies in 1884,47 though none were elected to the Empire's last legislature in 1889.48 In the 1880s &quot;it attracted sympathy in lesser numbers than [slavery] abolitionism, and at a slower pace.&quot;49 Its numbers only increased after 1888, adding new adherents consisting of farmers who had been slave owners and who perceived themselves victims of an unjust abolition of slavery that had not included any type of indemnity to them.505152 Even so, in 1889 the &quot;avowed republicans were probably a small minority&quot;53 as the &quot;republican ideals, in reality, had never managed to seduce the people. Its dissemination was restricted to the intellectual and military fields.&quot;54  As &quot;the republicans themselves recognized, the party did not have size, organization and popular support enough to overthrow the monarchy.&quot;55 Republicanism &quot;did not manage, at any moment of its development, to spur the national soul. It never had the stature to provoke a strong enthusiasm or enlist all forces that were divorcing from the throne.&quot;56 Even with radical propaganda and little interference from the authorities, the Republican Party in existence from the beginning of the 1870s was a small one.57 It praised republics such as the United States, France and Argentina, while conveniently ignoring progressive monarchies such as the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian countries.58 In 1889, its members were &quot;spokesmen in public squares and writers of periodicals. They were far from having the power to develop a propaganda that could shake the foundations of the throne.&quot;59 In the &quot;political process of the second empire [reign of Pedro II], the republican party had such a dull and secondary role that it might even have been forgotten; it was unable to influence rationales advocating the regime's dissolution.&quot;60 It was the crisis between the military and the Government, &quot;of very diverse origin and evolution&quot; from the republicanism, which was to prove the main factor in the fall of the monarchy.61
Pedro II showed no interest in the republican manifesto of 1870.62 The Marquis of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Vicente, then President of the Council of Ministers, suggested to the Emperor that republicans be forbidden to enter into public service, a practice then common in monarchies. Pedro II answered, &quot;Mr. S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Vicente, allow the nation to govern itself and decide whatever [monarchy or republic] they want.&quot;63 The President reprimanded the monarch, &quot;Your Majesty does not have a right to think in that way. The Monarchy is a constitutional doctrine which Your Majesty swore to maintain; it is not incarnate in the person of Your Majesty.&quot; But the Emperor did not care and simply answered: &quot;Well, if the Brazilians do not want me as their Emperor, I shall become a teacher instead!&quot;6465
The Emperor not only always refused to forbid republicans from becoming public servants, but also hired the republican military officer Benjamin Constant as a professor of mathematics to his grandsons.66 He allowed open republican activities, including newspapers, assemblies, meetings and political parties,67 and exempted republican deputies elected to the Chamber of Deputies from swearing allegiance to the crown.68 The freedom of the Press, &quot;one of the foundations of the regime, kept allowing fierce criticisms and vile caricatures opposing the regime and its public personalities.&quot;69 Pedro II was intransigent in his defense of the unrestricted freedom of speech70 which had existed in Brazil since independence in 1822.71 He was accused of being excessively tolerant towards the republicans,72 but &quot;he did not pay attention to several warnings stating that his behavior undermined the political foundation of the monarchy.&quot;73 In 1889, Pedro II said to Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Antonio Saraiva that he would not mind if Brazil became a republic.7475 The &quot;Emperor's indifference towards the fate of the regime was also one of the main factors in the fall of the Monarchy.&quot;76
Military indiscipline

Third trip to Europe
The emperor&lt;U+2019&gt;s health had considerably worsened by 1887 and fever attacks had become common.77 His personal doctors suggested a trip to Europe for medical treatment.78798081 When embarking, he was greeted by a crowd which cried out, &quot;Long live His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil!&quot;82 He left on 30 June 1887 along with his wife and his grandson Pedro Augusto.8384 Once more his daughter Isabel became regent in his place.85 He remained for a short time in Portugal and traveled on to Paris, where he stayed in the Grand Hotel as usual.86 There he received Louis Pasteur, Ambroise Thomas, Pierre &lt;U+00C9&gt;mile Levasseur, Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Copp&lt;U+00E9&gt;e, Alexandre Dumas, fils, Ars&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne Houssaye, Guerra Junqueiro, and two of Victor Hugo's grandsons, among others.87 In a conversation with Houssaye the emperor again lamented what he considered a &quot;crown of thorns&quot; he had to bear.88 Pedro II also saw his old friend Michel Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne Chevreul, who was by then 102 years old.89  The monarch was examined by the French doctors Charles-&lt;U+00C9&gt;douard Brown-S&lt;U+00E9&gt;quard, Jean-Martin Charcot and Michel Peter who recommended a visit to the spas at Baden-Baden.9091 He remained there for two months and met with old acquaintances, including Wilhelm I of Germany and Leopold II of Belgium.92 He also visited the tomb of his daughter Leopoldina in Coburg.93 He returned to Paris on 8 October 1887 and met his sisters Janu&lt;U+00E1&gt;ria and Francisca.94 From there he traveled to Italy where he was invited by the King of Italy to a dinner along with Victoria of the United Kingdom and Natalija Obrenovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, Queen of Serbia.95 In Florence he unveiled the painting Independence or Death by the Brazilian painter Pedro Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rico in the presence of the British Queen, the Serbian queen and Charles I, King of W&lt;U+00FC&gt;rttemberg.96 In Milan he met with Cesare Cant&lt;U+00F9&gt;.97 There his health worsened on 3 May 1888, and he passed two weeks between life and death, even being anointed.9899100 The doctor Charcot came from Paris to assist and administered caffeine by intervenous injection, resulting in an improvement in the emperor's health.101102 On 22 May he received news that slavery had been abolished in Brazil.103 Lying in bed with a weak voice and tears in his eyes, he said, &quot;Great people! Great people!&quot;104105106107
Pedro II returned to Brazil and disembarked in Rio de Janeiro on 22 August 1888.108109 The &quot;whole country welcomed him with an enthusiasm never seen before. From the capital, from the provinces, from everywhere, arrived proofs of affection and veneration. The emotion from those who saw him disembark, frail, thin, with bent body, weak legs, was one most profound.&quot;110 The cadets from the Military College climbed Sugarloaf Mountain and placed a gigantic banner on which was written &quot;Hail.&quot;111112113 Such popular enthusiasm directed toward the emperor was not matched even by the celebrations of his majority in 1840, in the Christie Affair of 1864, upon his departure to Rio Grande do Sul in 1865, or even after the victory in the War of the Triple Alliance in 1870.114115 &quot;To judge from the general manifestations of affection that the Emperor and the Empress had received on the occasion of their arrival from Europe, in this winter of 1888, no political institution seemed to be so strong as the monarchy in in Brazil.&quot;116 Even former slaves displayed loyalty towards the monarchy and vehemently opposed the republicans, whom they called &quot;the Paulistas.&quot;117 The &quot;monarchy seemed to be at the height of its popularity.&quot;118 Pedro II had reached the pinnacle of his prestige among Brazilians.119120
The end of slavery resulted in explicit support of republicanism by the rich and powerful coffee farmers, who held political, economic and social power in the country.121122 Although there was no desire in Brazil among the majority of the population to change the form of government,123 republicans began pressuring the Army and its main leader, Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca, to overthow the monarchy.124
Fall
On 9 November 1889, a large number of officers gathered in the Military Club and decided to stage a coup d&lt;U+2019&gt;etat aimed at the overthrow of the monarchy.125 Two days later in the house of Rui Barbosa a plan to execute the coup was drawn up by officers who included Benjamin Constant and Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca, plus two civilians: Quintino Bocai&lt;U+00FA&gt;va and Aristides Lobo. It was the only significant meeting in which civilian republicans participated, as Deodoro wished to exclude them from what he considered to be a strictly military matter.126 Deodoro still hesitated:127 &quot;I wanted to follow the Emperor's coffin, who is old and whom I deeply respect.&quot;128 But he eventually yielded to pressure: &quot;He [Benjamin Constant] wants it thus, let us make the Republic. Benjamin and I will take care of the military action; Mr. Quintino and his friends will organize everything else.&quot;129 At 11 p.m. on 14 November,130 Deodoro took command of 600 men, the majority of whom either had no idea of what was occurring or believed that they were organizing a defence against the National Guard or the Black Guard.131 A few republicans yelled &quot;Hail to the Republic&quot; but Deodoro ordered them to be silent.132  Upon learning of the revolt, the President of the Council of Ministers Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto, and the other Cabinet ministers went to Army Headquarters, located at the Field of Santana in the heart of the capital.133134135 The supposedly loyal troops there outnumbered and were better equipped than the rebel force.136 The adjutant-general [Commander] of the Army, Marshal Floriano Peixoto guaranteed his men's loyalty to Ouro Preto, but he was secretly in alliance with the rebels.137 Floriano and the Minister of the War Rufino En&lt;U+00E9&gt;ias, Viscount of Maracaj&lt;U+00FA&gt; (a cousin of Deodoro) ignored repeated orders from Ouro Preto to attack the rebels who were approaching the headquarters.138139 He tried to convince them, recalling the acts of bravery by the Brazilian military in the War of the Triple Alliance. But Floriano replied to him that, &quot;in front of us there were enemies, and here we are all Brazilians&quot;, which finally brought him to a realization of how far the mutiny had spread among the officer corps.140141 The ostensibly loyal troops opened the headquarters gates to Deodoro142 who cried out: &quot;Long live His Majesty the Emperor!&quot;143144 Deodoro met with Ouro Preto, and he (Deodoro) undertook to personally present the emperor with a list of the names of those to be included in a new cabinet.145 To the disillusionment of civilian and military republicans, Deodoro did not proclaim a Republic, and it seemed that he would only topple the cabinet.146 He was unsure whether he wanted to act against Pedro II, and the rebels themselves did not believe the coup would succeed.147 The few people who witnessed what occurred did not realize that it was a rebellion, and according to the republican Aristides Lobo, the populace was &quot;stunned&quot;.148149 &quot;Rarely has a revolution been so minor.&quot;150
On the morning of 15 November, Pedro II was in Petr&lt;U+00F3&gt;polis when he received the first telegram from Ouro Preto informing him of the rebellion. However, he did not assign much import to the news.151152 At 11 a.m. as he left a mass in honor of the 45th anniversary of his sister Maria II's death, the monarch received a second telegram and decided to return to Rio de Janeiro.153154155156 His wife expressed concern, but he told her, &quot;On what ma&lt;U+2019&gt;am? When I arrive there it will be over!&quot;157 He travelled by train, reading periodicals and scientific magazines. Not imagining the gravity of the situation, he arrived at the city palace at 3 p.m.158159 Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Rebou&lt;U+00E7&gt;as suggested that he go to the countryside to organize resistance.160161 The Marquis of Tamandar&lt;U+00E9&gt; asked for his permission to lead the Armada and suppress the rebellion.162 He dismissed all the ideas put forward and said, &quot;This is nothing. I know my countrymen.&quot;163 The emperor asked the Conservative senator Manuel Francisco Correia what he thought of the situation. Correia answered that he believed that it was the end of the monarchy. Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the possibility.164
Ouro Preto arrived at the palace at 4 p.m and suggested that Pedro II nominate senator Gaspar da Silveira Martins, who would arrive in the city two days later, as the new President.165166167 Deodoro avoided meeting personally with Pedro II,168 but once he heard that the emperor had chosen a personnal enemy of his for the office, he finally decided on the inauguration of the Republic.169170171172 The recently elected Chamber of Deputies was only to be called into session on 20 November, and the Senate was in recess.173 For this reason, Princess Isabel insisted that her father convoke the Council of State to deal with the situation. But she was given the reply, &quot;Later on.&quot;174175 The princess, on her own initiative, called the council members.176177 The Council assembled at 11 p.m, and after two hours recommended that the emperor appoint Ant&lt;U+00F4&gt;nio Saraiva instead of Silveira Martins.178179180 After accepting the office, this politician sent an emissary to negotiate with Deodoro. But Deodoro responded that is was too late to change his mind.181182 Upon hearing the reply, Pedro II commented, &quot;If it is so, it will be my retirement. I have worked too hard and I am tired. I will go rest then.&quot;183
Departure to exile
On Saturday 16 November, the imperial family were confined in the palace, surrounded by a cavalry regiment.184185 Pedro II continued reading scientific magazines and appeared calm throughout the day.186 At 3 p.m, Major Frederico Sol&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Sampaio Ribeiro informed the Imperial Family that the Republic had been proclaimed and that they must leave the country for exile within 24 hours.187188 The &quot;republicans had no courage to meet the Emperor, whom they secretly admired, face to face&quot;189 and therefore sent low-ranking officers to communicate with him.190 Sol&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, when complimenting the emperor, called him first &quot;Your Excellency&quot;, then &quot;Your Highness&quot; and lastly &quot;Your Majesty&quot;.191192193 Although clearly deposed, the emperor was still much respected by those around him, as illustrated by the parley between him and Sol&lt;U+00F3&gt;n.194195196 The notice of banishment caused the women to weep, while the men struggled to remain calm&lt;U+2014&gt;with the exception of Pedro II, who remained impassive.197198199200 The monarch resolved to travel the afternoon of the following day and sent a written message to the Provisional Government stating that he agreed to leave the country.201202203204205  The republican Government feared that demonstrations in favor of the emperor might erupt on Monday 17 November.206207208209 The lieutenant colonel Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Nepomuceno de Medeiros Mallet was sent at dawn to inform the imperial family that it must leave immediately.210 A commotion arose among those present until Pedro II himself appeared in the room. Mallet respectfully told him that the Government had asked them to depart at once. The emperor refused to leave immediately,211212213214215216 claiming that he was not a slave trying to escape in the middle of the night.217218 Mallet tried to persuade him, alleging that republican students would launch violent demonstrations against him. The emperor seemed skeptical: &quot;Who gives credence to students?&quot;219 At that moment, shots were heard outside. Mallet left the palace to find out what had happened. Fifteen imperial sailors had attempted to land in support of the emperor but were overpowered and imprisoned by republican troops. Mallet returned to the building and deceived Pedro II by saying that militant republicans had tried to attack him and his family.220 Astonished, the emperor agreed to leave.221222223
When Pedro II left the palace, the soldiers who were standing guard outside instinctively presented arms, and he responded by raising his hat.224 A few close friends voluntarily accompanied the imperial family into exile, including Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Rebou&lt;U+00E7&gt;as and Franklin D&lt;U+00F3&gt;ria, Baron of Loreto.225226 Very few were on hand to witness the departure.227 They were taken to the steamship Parna&lt;U+00ED&gt;ba and after that to the ship Alagoas, in which they sailed the next day to Europe.228229230 Before the final departure, Pedro II sent a short message to his faithful friend the Marquis of Tamandar&lt;U+00E9&gt;, who had remained at his side until embarkation: &quot;What is done, is done. It remains to all of you to establish order and to consolidate your institutions.&quot;231 After learning that the emperor had left, Benjamin Constant spoke: &quot;It is fulfilled, the most painful of our duties.&quot;232 Rui Barbosa later recalled saying to Major Carlos Nunes de Aguiar, who had been at his side witnessing the departure from afar: &quot;You were right to weep when the emperor left.&quot;233 It was &quot;the end of the monarchy, but not of myth, called d. Pedro.&quot;234
The government headed by Deodoro &quot;was little more than a military dictatorship. The army dominated affairs both at Rio de Janeiro and in the states. Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power.&quot;235 The republican regime which followed the overthrow of the monarchy revealed itself to be highly unstable. In &quot;a little more than a century of existence, the Brazilian Republic faced twelve states of emergency, seventeen Institutional Acts, the National Congress dissolved six times, nineteen military revolutions, two presidential resignations, three presidents prevented from assuming office, four presidents deposed, seven different Constitutions, four dictatorships, and nine authoritarian governments.&quot;236
