Description
When asked why Hollywood was chosen as a single in an interview with the BBC News website, Marina said: 
Marina told The Sun: &quot;That track is a sarcastic and cynical take on everything that's commercial about America. I love the country and people dearly and can't wait to tour there but I hate the way it brainwashes you. I am seduced by its pop culture but I don't want my brain to be infected.&quot; 4
Critical reception
Digital Spy music editor Nick Levine wrote that &quot;Hollywood&quot; has a &quot;whopping great chorus, cascading synths - as glittery and eighties as one of Pat Butcher's party frocks, no less - and intriguing lyrics about being 'obsessed with the mess that's America'.&quot; He also went on to say that the song &quot;manages to sound like an absolute smash without sacrificing Marina's quintessential, well, Marinaness.&quot;5 Fraser McAlpine of the BBC Chart Blog called the track an &quot;properly amazing pop song&quot; and stated that &quot;the level of insight displayed about America, culturally and politically, is on a par with the Razorlight song about America (the name of which temporarily escapes me). Marina, for all that she's spotted that Hollywood is something of an upsettingly fake place, with scope for quite exciting things to happen, seems to get as much enjoyment out of just singing the word as she does from puncturing its ego.&quot;6
