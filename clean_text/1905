Early life
Kuriyagawa Hakuson was born in Kyoto. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University, where he had studied under Koizumi Yakumo and Natsume Soseki, and later became a professor at Kumamoto University and Kyoto Imperial University. He lectured on 19th century Western literature, and criticized traditional Japanese writing on naturalism and romanticism.

In Kindai no ren-aikan Hakuson regarded &quot;love marriage&quot; (renai kekkon) to be a practice indicating an advanced nation and society, as opposed to the practice of arranged marriage,&lt;U+201D&gt; which was more commonly practiced in Japan at the time,
He was killed by a tsunami, which swept away his cottage near the beach in Kamakura, Kanagawa prefecture, during the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923.
