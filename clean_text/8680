Japan  ( Nippon or Nihon; formally   or Nihon-koku, literally &quot;[the] State of Japan&quot;) is an island nation in East Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, it lies to the east of the Sea of Japan, China, North Korea, South Korea and Russia, stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. The characters that make up Japan's name mean &quot;sun-origin&quot;, which is why Japan is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Land of the Rising Sun&quot;.
Japan is an archipelago of 6,852 islands. The four largest islands are Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu and Shikoku. Together, these four islands hold about 97 percent of Japan's land area. Japan has the world's tenth-largest population, with more than 126 million people. Honsh&lt;U+016B&gt;'s Greater Tokyo Area, includes the de facto capital city of Tokyo and several surrounding prefectures. It is the largest metropolitan area in the world, with more than 30 million residents.
Archaeological research indicates that people lived in Japan as early as the Upper Paleolithic period. The first written mention of Japan is found in Chinese texts from the 1st century AD. Influence from other nations followed by long periods of isolation has characterized Japan's history. Japan evolved into a cohesive society during the Heian period (8th-11th centuries AD). From the 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military dictatorships or shogunates in the name of the Emperor. In the early 17th century, Japan entered into a long period of isolation, which was only ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. Nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection followed before the Meiji Emperor was restored as head of state in 1868 and the Empire of Japan was proclaimed, with the Emperor enshrined as a divine symbol of the nation.
Periodic insurrections and civil disturbances continued into the 1880s. A modern constitution was promulgated in 1889 and a Western-style parliament established. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism. From 1931, military expansion into China and Manchuria led to the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Japan allied itself with the Axis powers in 1940, and the war in China became part of World War II in 1941. Successive military defeats and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki led to the end of the war in 1945, Japan's surrender and the loss of its empire. Under Allied military occupation lasting until 1952, Japan dissolved and restructured its military, adopted a revised constitution in 1947 and became a unitary constitutional monarchy with an emperor and a democratically elected legislature.
A major economic power,1 Japan has the world's third-largest economy by nominal GDP and the world's fourth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. It is also the world's fourth-largest exporter and fourth-largest importer. Although Japan has officially renounced its right to declare war, it maintains a modern military with the fifth largest military budget,2 used for self-defense and peacekeeping roles. According to Japan's health ministry, Japanese women have the second highest life expectancy of any country in the world.3 According to the United Nations, Japan also has the third lowest infant mortality rate.45
Etymology

The English word Japan derives from the Chinese pronunciation of the Japanese name,  , which in Japanese is pronounced Nippon  or Nihon . The pronunciation Nippon is more formal, and is in Japanese used for most official purposes, including international sporting events.
From the Meiji Restoration until the end of World War II, the full title of Japan was , meaning &quot;the Empire of Great Japan&quot;. Today the name  is used as a formal modern-day equivalent; countries like Japan whose long form does not contain a descriptive designation are generally given a name appended by the character , meaning &quot;country&quot;, &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;state&quot;.
Japanese people refer to themselves as  and to their language as . Both Nippon and Nihon mean &quot;sun-origin&quot; and are often translated as Land of the Rising Sun. This nomenclature comes from Japanese missions to Imperial China and refers to Japan's eastward position relative to China. Before Nihon came into official use, Japan was known as  or .6
The English word for Japan came to the West via early trade routes. The Old Mandarin or possibly early Wu Chinese (&lt;U+5433&gt;&lt;U+8A9E&gt;) pronunciation of Japan was recorded by Marco Polo as Cipangu. In modern Shanghainese, a Wu dialect, the pronunciation of characters  'Japan' is Zeppen . The old Malay word for Japan, Jepang, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect, probably Fukienese or Ningpo,7 and this Malay word was encountered by Portuguese traders in Malacca in the 16th century. Portuguese traders were the first to bring the word to Europe.8 An early record of the word in English is in a 1565 letter, spelled Giapan.9
History

Prehistory and ancient history
 A Paleolithic culture around 30,000 BC constitutes the first known habitation of the Japanese archipelago. This was followed from around 14,000 BC (the start of the J&lt;U+014D&gt;mon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture, who include ancestors of both the contemporary Ainu people and Yamato people,1011 characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture.12 Decorated clay vessels from this period are some of the oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world. Around 300 BC, the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands, intermingling with the J&lt;U+014D&gt;mon.13 The Yayoi period, starting around 500 BC, saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming,14 a new style of pottery,15 and metallurgy, introduced from China and Korea.16
Japan first appears in written history in the Chinese Book of Han.17 According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during the 3rd century was called Yamataikoku. Buddhism was first introduced to Japan from Baekje of Korea, but the subsequent development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China.18 Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592&lt;U+2013&gt;710).19
The Nara period (710&lt;U+2013&gt;784) of the 8th century marked the emergence of a strong Japanese state, centered on an imperial court in Heij&lt;U+014D&gt;-ky&lt;U+014D&gt; (modern Nara). The Nara period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literature as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired art and architecture.20 The smallpox epidemic of 735&lt;U+2013&gt;737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population.21 In 784, Emperor Kammu moved the capital from Nara to Nagaoka-ky&lt;U+014D&gt; before relocating it to Heian-ky&lt;U+014D&gt; (modern Kyoto) in 794.
 This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794&lt;U+2013&gt;1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged, noted for its art, poetry and prose. Lady Murasaki's The Tale of Genji and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem Kimigayo were written during this time.22
Buddhism began to spread during the Heian era chiefly through two major sects, Tendai by Saich&lt;U+014D&gt;, and Shingon by K&lt;U+016B&gt;kai. Pure Land Buddhism (J&lt;U+014D&gt;do-sh&lt;U+016B&gt;, J&lt;U+014D&gt;do Shinsh&lt;U+016B&gt;) greatly becomes popular in the latter half of the 11th century.
Feudal era
Japan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai. In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan in the Genpei war, sung in the epic Tale of Heike, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo was appointed shogun and established a base of power in Kamakura. After his death, the H&lt;U+014D&gt;j&lt;U+014D&gt; clan came to power as regents for the shoguns. The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185&lt;U+2013&gt;1333) and became popular among the samurai class.23 The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281, but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo. Go-Daigo was himself defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336.
 Ashikaga Takauji established the shogunate in Muromachi, Kyoto. This was the start of the Muromachi Period (1336&lt;U+2013&gt;1573). The Ashikaga shogunate achieved glory in the age of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, and the culture based on Zen Buddhism (art of Miyabi) prospered. This evolved to Higashiyama Culture, and prospered until the 16th century. On the other hand, the succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (daimyo), and a civil war (the &lt;U+014C&gt;nin War) began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (&quot;Warring States&quot;).24
During the 16th century, traders and Jesuit missionaries from Portugal reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West. Oda Nobunaga conquered many other daimyo using European technology and firearms; after he was assassinated in 1582, his successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified the nation in 1590. Hideyoshi invaded Korea twice, but following defeats by Korean and Ming Chinese forces and Hideyoshi's death, Japanese troops were withdrawn in 1598.25 This age is called Azuchi&lt;U+2013&gt;Momoyama period (1573&lt;U+2013&gt;1603).
Tokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's son and used his position to gain political and military support. When open war broke out, he defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Ieyasu was appointed shogun in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo (modern Tokyo).26 The Tokugawa shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimyo;27 and in 1639, the isolationist sakoku (&quot;closed country&quot;) policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603&lt;U+2013&gt;1868).28 The study of Western sciences, known as rangaku, continued through contact with the Dutch enclave at Dejima in Nagasaki. The Edo period also gave rise to kokugaku (&quot;national studies&quot;), the study of Japan by the Japanese.29
Modern era
On 31 March 1854, Commodore Matthew Perry and the &quot;Black Ships&quot; of the United States Navy forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the Convention of Kanagawa. Subsequent similar treaties with Western countries in the Bakumatsu period brought economic and political crises. The resignation of the shogun led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the Emperor (the Meiji Restoration).30
 Adopting Western political, judicial and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution, and assembled the Imperial Diet. The Meiji Restoration transformed the Empire of Japan into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence. After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894&lt;U+2013&gt;1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904&lt;U+2013&gt;1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea, and the southern half of Sakhalin.31 Japan's population grew from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million in 1935.32
 The early 20th century saw a brief period of &quot;Taish&lt;U+014D&gt; democracy&quot; overshadowed by increasing expansionism and militarization. World War I enabled Japan, on the side of the victorious Allies, to widen its influence and territorial holdings. It continued its expansionist policy by occupying Manchuria in 1931; as a result of international condemnation of this occupation, Japan resigned from the League of Nations two years later. In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany, and the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers.33 In 1941, Japan negotiated the Soviet&lt;U+2013&gt;Japanese Neutrality Pact.34
The Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937&lt;U+2013&gt;1945). The Imperial Japanese Army swiftly captured the capital Nanjing and conducted the Nanking Massacre.35 In 1940, the Empire then invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan.36 On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked the US naval base at Pearl Harbor and declared war, bringing the US into World War II.3738 After the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender on 15 August.39 The war cost Japan and the rest of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere millions of lives and left much of the nation's industry and infrastructure destroyed. The Allies (led by the US) repatriated millions of ethnic Japanese from colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese empire and restoring the independence of its conquered territories.40 The Allies also convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East on 3 May 1946 to prosecute some Japanese leaders for war crimes. However, the bacteriological research units and members of the imperial family involved in the war were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by the Supreme Allied Commander despite calls for trials for both groups.41
In 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices. The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 195242 and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956. Japan later achieved rapid growth to become the second-largest economy in the world, until surpassed by China in 2010. This ended in the mid-1990s when Japan suffered a major recession. In the beginning of the 21st century, positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery.43 On 11 March 2011, Japan suffered the strongest earthquake in its recorded history; this triggered the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, one of the worst disasters in the history of nuclear power.44
Government and politics

Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko

Japan is a constitutional monarchy where the power of the Emperor is very limited. As a ceremonial figurehead, he is defined by the constitution as &quot;the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people.&quot; Power is held chiefly by the Prime Minister of Japan and other elected members of the Diet, while sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people.45 Akihito is the current Emperor of Japan; Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan, stands as next in line to the throne.
Japan's legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral parliament. The Diet consists of a House of Representatives with 480 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and a House of Councillors of 242 seats, whose popularly elected members serve six-year terms. There is universal suffrage for adults over 20 years of age,46 with a secret ballot for all elected offices.47 The Diet is dominated by the social liberal Democratic Party of Japan and the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The LDP has enjoyed near continuous electoral success since 1955, except for a brief 11 month period between 1993 and 1994, and from 2009 to 2012. It holds 294 seats in the lower house and 83 seats in the upper house.
The Prime Minister of Japan is the head of government and is appointed by the Emperor after being designated by the Diet from among its members. The Prime Minister is the head of the Cabinet, and he appoints and dismisses the Ministers of State. Following the LDP's landslide victory in the 2012 general election, Shinz&lt;U+014D&gt; Abe replaced Yoshihiko Noda as the Prime Minister on 26 December 2012.48 Although the Prime Minister is formally appointed by the Emperor, the Constitution of Japan explicitly requires the Emperor to appoint whoever is designated by the Diet.49
Historically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki.50 However, since the late 19th century the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a civil code based on a draft of the German B&lt;U+00FC&gt;rgerliches Gesetzbuch; with post&lt;U+2013&gt;World War II modifications, the code remains in effect.51 Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature and has the rubber stamp of the Emperor. The Constitution requires that the Emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet, without specifically giving him the power to oppose legislation.52 Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.53 The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.54
Foreign relations and military

 Japan is a member of the G8, APEC, and &quot;ASEAN Plus Three&quot;, and is a participant in the East Asia Summit. Japan signed a security pact with Australia in March 200755 and with India in October 2008.56 It is the world's third largest donor of official development assistance after the United States and France, donating US$9.48 billion in 2009.57
Japan has close economic and military relations with the United States; the US-Japan security alliance acts as the cornerstone of the nation's foreign policy.58 A member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan has served as a non-permanent Security Council member for a total of 20 years, most recently for 2009 and 2010. It is one of the G4 nations seeking permanent membership in the Security Council.59
Japan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors: with Russia over the South Kuril Islands, with South Korea over the Liancourt Rocks, with China and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands, and with China over the EEZ around Okinotorishima.60 Japan also faces an ongoing dispute with North Korea over the latter's abduction of Japanese citizens and its nuclear weapons and missile program (see also Six-party talks).61
Japan maintains one of the largest military budgets of any country in the world.62 Japan contributed non-combatant troops to the Iraq War but subsequently withdrew its forces.63 The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force is a regular participant in RIMPAC maritime exercises.64
Japan's military is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes. Japan's military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF), the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). The forces have been recently used in peacekeeping operations; the deployment of troops to Iraq marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II.65 Nippon Keidanren has called on the government to lift the ban on arms exports so that Japan can join multinational projects such as the Joint Strike Fighter.66
Administrative divisions

Japan consists of forty-seven prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor, legislature and administrative bureaucracy. Each prefecture is further divided into cities, towns and villages.67 The nation is currently undergoing administrative reorganization by merging many of the cities, towns and villages with each other. This process will reduce the number of sub-prefecture administrative regions and is expected to cut administrative costs.68

Geography


Topographic map of the Japanese archipelago

Japan has a total of 6,852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of East Asia.6970 The country, including all of the islands it controls, lies between latitudes 24&lt;U+00B0&gt; and 46&lt;U+00B0&gt;N, and longitudes 122&lt;U+00B0&gt; and 146&lt;U+00B0&gt;E. The main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaid&lt;U+014D&gt;, Honsh&lt;U+016B&gt;, Shikoku and Ky&lt;U+016B&gt;sh&lt;U+016B&gt;. The Ry&lt;U+016B&gt;ky&lt;U+016B&gt; Islands, including Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Ky&lt;U+016B&gt;sh&lt;U+016B&gt;. Together they are often known as the Japanese Archipelago.71
About 73 percent of Japan is forested, mountainous, and unsuitable for agricultural, industrial, or residential use.7273 As a result, the habitable zones, mainly located in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities. Japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.74
The islands of Japan are located in a volcanic zone on the Pacific Ring of Fire. They are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the continental Amurian Plate and Okinawa Plate to the south, and subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk Plate to the north. Japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent. The subducting plates pulled Japan eastward, opening the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago.75
Japan has 108 active volcanoes. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century.76 The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people.77 More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 T&lt;U+014D&gt;hoku earthquake, a 9.0-magnitude78 quake which hit Japan on 11 March 2011, and triggered a large tsunami.79 On 24 May 2012, 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of northeastern Japan. However, no tsunami was generated.80
Climate

 
The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate, but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaid&lt;U+014D&gt;, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ry&lt;U+016B&gt;ky&lt;U+016B&gt; Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.81
In the Sea of Japan zone on Honsh&lt;U+016B&gt;'s west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn wind. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter, and between day and night; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Ch&lt;U+016B&gt;goku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.82
The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season. The generally humid, temperate climate exhibits marked seasonal variation such as the blooming of the spring cherry blossoms, the calls of the summer cicada and fall foliage colors that are celebrated in art and literature.83
The average winter temperature in Japan is  and the average summer temperature is .84 The highest temperature ever measured in Japan&lt;U+2014&gt;&lt;U+2014&gt;was recorded on 16 August 2007.85 The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching Hokkaid&lt;U+014D&gt; in late July. In most of Honsh&lt;U+016B&gt;, the rainy season begins before the middle of June and lasts about six weeks. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.86
Biodiversity
 Japan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ry&lt;U+016B&gt;ky&lt;U+016B&gt; and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.87 Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife, including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, and the Japanese giant salamander.88 A large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as thirty-seven Ramsar wetland sites.8990 Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.91
Environment

In the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern about the problem, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970.92 The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.93 Current environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.94
Japan is one of the world's leaders in the development of new environment-friendly technologies, and is ranked 20th best in the world in the 2010 Environmental Performance Index.95 As a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, and host of the 1997 conference which created it, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change.96
Economy

Economic history
Some of the structural features for Japan's economic growth developed in the Edo period, such as the network of transport routes, by road and water, and the futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers.98 During the Meiji period from 1868, Japan expanded economically with the embrace of the market economy.99 Many of today's enterprises were founded at the time, and Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia.100 The period of overall real economic growth from the 1960s to the 1980s has been called the Japanese post-war economic miracle: it averaged 7.5 percent in the 1960s and 1970s, and 3.2 percent in the 1980s and early 1990s.101
Growth slowed markedly in the 1990s during what the Japanese call the Lost Decade, largely because of the after-effects of the Japanese asset price bubble and domestic policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Government efforts to revive economic growth met with little success and were further hampered by the global slowdown in 2000.102 The economy showed strong signs of recovery after 2005; GDP growth for that year was 2.8 percent, surpassing the growth rates of the US and European Union during the same period.103

, Japan is the third largest national economy in the world, after the United States and China, in terms of nominal GDP,104 and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity.105 , Japan's public debt was more than 200 percent of its annual gross domestic product, the largest of any nation in the world. In August 2011, Moody's rating has cut Japan's long-term sovereign debt rating one notch from Aa3 to Aa2 inline with the size of the country's deficit and borrowing level. The large budget deficits and government debt since the 2009 global recession and followed by earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 made the rating downgrade.106 The service sector accounts for three quarters of the gross domestic product.107
Exports
The Ministry of Finance in Japan, led by Minister Tar&lt;U+014D&gt; As&lt;U+014D&gt;, is responsible for maintaining statistical data regarding the Japanese economy. Japan has a large industrial capacity, and is home to some of the largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, electronics, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods. Agricultural businesses in Japan cultivate 13 percent of Japan's land, and Japan accounts for nearly 15 percent of the global fish catch, second only to China.108 As of 2010, Japan's labor force consisted of some 65.9 million workers.109 Japan has a low unemployment rate of around four percent. Almost one in six Japanese, or 20 million people, lived in poverty in 2007.110 Housing in Japan is characterized by limited land supply in urban areas.111
 Japan's exports amounted to US$4,210 per capita in 2005. Japan's main export markets are China (18.88 percent), the United States (16.42 percent), South Korea (8.13 percent), Taiwan (6.27 percent) and Hong Kong (5.49 percent) as of 2009. Its main exports are transportation equipment, motor vehicles, electronics, electrical machinery and chemicals.112 Japan's main import markets as of 2009 are China (22.2 percent), the US (10.96 percent), Australia (6.29 percent), Saudi Arabia (5.29 percent), United Arab Emirates (4.12 percent), South Korea (3.98 percent) and Indonesia (3.95 percent).113
Imports
Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs (in particular beef), chemicals, textiles and raw materials for its industries.114 By market share measures, domestic markets are the least open of any OECD country.115 Junichiro Koizumi's administration began some pro-competition reforms, and foreign investment in Japan has soared.116
Japan ranks 12th of 178 countries in the 2008 Ease of doing business index and has one of the smallest tax revenues of the developed world. The Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are relatively common in the Japanese work environment.117118 Japanese companies are known for management methods like &quot;The Toyota Way&quot;, and shareholder activism is rare.119
Some of the largest enterprises in Japan include Toyota, Nintendo, NTT DoCoMo, Canon, Honda, Takeda Pharmaceutical, Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba, Sharp, Nippon Steel, Nippon Oil, and Seven &amp; I Holdings Co..120 It has some of the world's largest banks, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange (known for its Nikkei 225 and TOPIX indices) stands as the second largest in the world by market capitalization.121 Japan is home to 326 companies from the Forbes Global 2000 or 16.3 percent (as of 2006).122 In 2013, it was announced that Japan would be importing shale natural gas.123
Science and technology

 Japan is a leading nation in scientific research, particularly technology, machinery and biomedical research. Nearly 700,000 researchers share a US$130 billion research and development budget, the third largest in the world.124 Japan is a world leader in fundamental scientific research, having produced sixteen Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine,125 three Fields medalists,126 and one Gauss Prize laureate.127 Some of Japan's more prominent technological contributions are in the fields of electronics, automobiles, machinery, earthquake engineering, industrial robotics, optics, chemicals, semiconductors and metals. Japan leads the world in robotics production and use, possessing more than half (402,200 of 742,500) of the world's industrial robots.128
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is Japan's space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites. It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kibo) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008.129 Japan's plans in space exploration include: launching a space probe to Venus, Akatsuki;130131 developing the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter to be launched in 2013;132133 and building a moon base by 2030.134
On 14 September 2007, it launched lunar explorer &quot;SELENE&quot; (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) on an H-IIA (Model H2A2022) carrier rocket from Tanegashima Space Center. SELENE is also known as Kaguya, after the lunar princess of The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter.135 Kaguya is the largest lunar mission since the Apollo program. Its purpose is to gather data on the moon's origin and evolution. It entered a lunar orbit on 4 October,136137 flying at an altitude of about .138 The probe's mission was ended when it was deliberately crashed by JAXA into the Moon on 11 June 2009.139
Infrastructure


Nozomi Shinkansen or 'Bullet Train' at Tokyo Station140

As of 2008, 46.4 percent of energy in Japan is produced from petroleum, 21.4 percent from coal, 16.7 percent from natural gas, 9.7 percent from nuclear power, and 2.9 percent from hydropower. Nuclear power produced 25.1 percent of Japan's electricity, as of 2009.141 However, as of 5 May 2012, all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, though government officials have been continuing to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some of Japan's 50 nuclear reactors to service.142 Given its heavy dependence on imported energy,143 Japan has aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.144
Japan's road spending has been extensive.145 Its 1.2 million kilometers of paved road are the main means of transportation.146 A single network of high-speed, divided, limited-access toll roads connects major cities and is operated by toll-collecting enterprises. New and used cars are inexpensive; car ownership fees and fuel levies are used to promote energy efficiency. However, at just 50 percent of all distance traveled, car usage is the lowest of all G8 countries.147
Dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu Corporation, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen trains connect major cities and Japanese trains are known for their safety and punctuality.148149 Proposals for a new Maglev route between Tokyo and Osaka are at an advanced stage.150 There are 173 airports in Japan; the largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport, is Asia's second-busiest airport.151 The largest international gateways are Narita International Airport, Kansai International Airport and Ch&lt;U+016B&gt;bu Centrair International Airport.152 Nagoya Port is the country's largest and busiest port, accounting for 10 percent of Japan's trade value.153
Demographics

  Japan's population is estimated at around 127.3 million,154 with 80% of the population living on Honsh&lt;U+016B&gt;. Japanese society is linguistically and culturally homogeneous,155 composed of 98.5% ethnic Japanese,156 with small populations of foreign workers.157 Zainichi Koreans,158 Zainichi Chinese, Filipinos, Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent,159 and Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent are among the small minority groups in Japan.160 In 2003, there were about 134,700 non-Latin American Western and 345,500 Latin American expatriates, 274,700 of whom were Brazilians (said to be primarily Japanese descendants, or nikkeijin, along with their spouses),161 the largest community of Westerners.162
The most dominant native ethnic group is the Yamato people; primary minority groups include the indigenous Ainu163 and Ryukyuan peoples, as well as social minority groups like the burakumin.164 There are persons of mixed ancestry incorporated among the 'ethnic Japanese' or Yamato, such as those from Ogasawara Archipelago where roughly one-tenth of the Japanese population can have European, American, Micronesian and/or Polynesian backgrounds, with some families going back up to seven generations.165 In spite of the widespread belief that Japan is ethnically homogeneous (in 2009, foreign-born non-naturalized workers made up only 1.7% of the total population),166 also because of the absence of ethnicity and/or race statistics for Japanese nationals, at least one analysis describes Japan as a multiethnic society, for example, John Lie.167 However, this statement is refused by many sectors of Japanese society, who still tend to preserve the idea of Japan being a monocultural society and with this ideology of homogeneity, has traditionally rejected any need to recognize ethnic differences in Japan, even as such claims have been rejected by such ethnic minorities as the Ainu and Ryukyuan people. Former Japanese Prime Minister Tar&lt;U+014D&gt; As&lt;U+014D&gt; has once described Japan as being a nation of &lt;U+201C&gt;one race, one civilization, one language and one culture&lt;U+201D&gt;.168
Japan has the longest overall life expectancy at birth of any country in the world: 83.5 years for persons born in the period 2010&lt;U+2013&gt;2015.169170 The Japanese population is rapidly aging as a result of a post&lt;U+2013&gt;World War II baby boom followed by a decrease in birth rates. In 2009, about 22.7 percent of the population was over 65, by 2050 almost 40 percent of the population will be aged 65 and over, as projected in December 2006.171
The changes in demographic structure have created a number of social issues, particularly a potential decline in workforce population and increase in the cost of social security benefits like the public pension plan.172 A growing number of younger Japanese are preferring not to marry or have families.173 In 2011, Japan's population dropped for a fifth year, falling by 204,000 people to 126.24 million people. This was the greatest decline since at least 1947, when comparable figures were first compiled.174 This decline was made worse by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami which killed nearly 16,000 people with approximately another 3,000 still listed as missing.175
Japan's population is expected to drop to 95 million by 2050,176177 demographers and government planners are currently in a heated debate over how to cope with this problem.178 Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population.179180 Japan accepts a steady flow of 15,000 new Japanese citizens by naturalization (&lt;U+5E30&gt;&lt;U+5316&gt;) per year.181 According to the UNHCR, in 2012 Japan accepted just 18 refugees for resettlement,182 while the US took in 76,000.183
Japan suffers from a high suicide rate.184185 In 2009, the number of suicides exceeded 30,000 for the twelfth straight year.186 Suicide is the leading cause of death for people under 30.187

Religion


Torii of Itsukushima Shrine near Hiroshima, one of the Three Views of Japan and a UNESCO World Heritage Site

Japan enjoys full religious freedom based on Article 20 of its Constitution. Upper estimates suggest that 84&lt;U+2013&gt;96 percent of the Japanese population subscribe to Buddhism or Shinto, including a large number of followers of a syncretism of both religions.188189 However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. Other studies have suggested that only 30 percent of the population identify themselves as belonging to a religion.190 According to Edwin Reischauer and Marius Jansen, some 70&lt;U+2013&gt;80% of the Japanese regularly tell pollsters they do not consider themselves believers in any religion.191
Nevertheless, the level of participation remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year. Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.192 Japanese streets are decorated on Tanabata, Obon and Christmas. Fewer than one percent of Japanese are Christian.193 Other minority religions include Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, and Judaism, and since the mid-19th century numerous new religious movements have emerged in Japan.194 There were 8 Christian Prime Ministers, such as Takashi Hara, Tetsu Katayama, Ichiro Hatoyama, Masayoshi Ohira and Taro Aso.
Languages

More than 99 percent of the population speaks Japanese as their first language.195 Japanese is an agglutinative language distinguished by a system of honorifics reflecting the hierarchical nature of Japanese society, with verb forms and particular vocabulary indicating the relative status of speaker and listener. Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on simplified Chinese characters), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.196
Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages, also part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in Okinawa; however, few children learn these languages.197 The Ainu language, which has no proven relationship to Japanese or any other language, is moribund, with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaido.198 Most public and private schools require students to take courses in both Japanese and English.199
Education

 Primary schools, secondary schools and universities were introduced in 1872 as a result of the Meiji Restoration.200 Since 1947, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and middle school, which together last for nine years (from age 6 to age 15). Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school, and, according to the MEXT, as of 2005 about 75.9 percent of high school graduates attend a university, junior college, trade school, or other higher education institution.201
The two top-ranking universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University.202203 The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds as sixth best in the world.204
Health

In Japan, health care is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.205 Patients are free to select the physicians or facilities of their choice.206
Culture
  Japanese culture has evolved greatly from its origins. Contemporary culture combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America. Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures.207 Sixteen sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, twelve of which are of cultural significance.208
Art

The Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture.209 Largely of wood, traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.210 Japanese sculpture, largely of wood, and Japanese painting are among the oldest of the Japanese arts, with early figurative paintings dating back to at least 300 BC. The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese aesthetics and adaptation of imported ideas.211
The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism.212 Famous ukiyo-e artists include Hokusai and Hiroshige. The fusion of traditional woodblock printing and Western art led to the creation of manga, a comic book format that is now popular within and outside Japan.213 Manga-influenced animation for television and film is called anime. Japanese-made video game consoles have been popular since the 1980s.214
Music

Japanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The accompanied recitative of the Noh drama dates from the 14th century and the popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, from the sixteenth.215 Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, now forms an integral part of Japanese culture. The imperial court ensemble Gagaku has influenced the work of some modern Western composers.216
Notable classical composers from Japan include Toru Takemitsu and Rentar&lt;U+014D&gt; Taki. Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop, or Japanese popular music.217 Karaoke is the most widely practiced cultural activity in Japan. A 1993 survey by the Cultural Affairs Agency found that more Japanese had sung karaoke that year than had participated in traditional pursuits such as flower arranging (ikebana) or tea ceremonies.218
Literature

 The earliest works of Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'y&lt;U+014D&gt;sh&lt;U+016B&gt; poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters.219220 In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (Hiragana and Katakana) was developed. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest Japanese narrative.221 An account of Heian court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Sh&lt;U+014D&gt;nagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.222223
During the Edo period, the ch&lt;U+014D&gt;nin (&quot;townspeople&quot;) overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bash&lt;U+014D&gt; revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinsh&lt;U+016B&gt; with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue Oku no Hosomichi.224 The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume S&lt;U+014D&gt;seki and Mori &lt;U+014C&gt;gai were the first &quot;modern&quot; novelists of Japan, followed by Ry&lt;U+016B&gt;nosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichir&lt;U+014D&gt; Tanizaki, Yukio Mishima and, more recently, Haruki Murakami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors&lt;U+2014&gt;Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzabur&lt;U+014D&gt; &lt;U+014C&gt;e (1994).225
Cuisine

 Japanese cuisine is based on combining staple foods, typically Japanese rice or noodles, with a soup and okazu &lt;U+2014&gt; dishes made from fish, vegetable, tofu and the like &lt;U+2013&gt; to add flavor to the staple food. In the early modern era ingredients such as red meats that had previously not been widely used in Japan were introduced. Japanese cuisine is known for its emphasis on seasonality of food,226 quality of ingredients and presentation. Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients. The Michelin Guide has awarded Japanese cities more Michelin stars than the rest of the world combined.227
Sports

 Traditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport.228 Japanese martial arts such as judo, karate and kendo are also widely practiced and enjoyed by spectators in the country. After the Meiji Restoration, many Western sports were introduced in Japan and began to spread through the education system.229 Japan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964. Japan has hosted the Winter Olympics twice: Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998.230 Tokyo will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, making Tokyo the first Asian city to host the Olympics twice.231
Baseball is currently the most popular spectator sport in the country. Japan's top professional league, Nippon Professional Baseball, was established in 1936.232 Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992, association football has also gained a wide following.233 Japan was a venue of the Intercontinental Cup from 1981 to 2004 and co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea.234 Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times.235 Also, Japan recently won the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011.236 Golf is also popular in Japan,237 as are forms of auto racing like the Super GT series and Formula Nippon.238 The country has produced one NBA player, Yuta Tabuse.239
