Professor Vivian Wing-Wah Yam (&lt;U+4EFB&gt;&lt;U+8A60&gt;&lt;U+83EF&gt;&lt;U+8B1B&gt;&lt;U+5EA7&gt;&lt;U+6559&gt;&lt;U+6388&gt;; February 10, 1963)1 CSci, CChem, FRSC,2 is a chemist from British Hong Kong. The youngest member to be elected to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, she was a 2011 L'Or&lt;U+00E9&gt;al-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science laureate,3 &quot;For her work on light-emitting materials and innovative ways of capturing solar energy. &quot;4
Life
Yam was born in the British Colony of Hong Kong. Her father was a civil engineer and Yam say that he nor her mother steered her towards her career. Yam cites being intrigued by the sight of mercury and a workaholic and pregnant biology teacher who taught her up to the very last minute.5
Yam attended an Anglican grammar school. She received her B.Sc in Chemistry (1985) and PhD (1988) degrees6 at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) where she was on the badminton team, studying under Chi-Ming Che. She married Patrick Shing-Tat whom she met in Che&lt;U+2019&gt;s laboratory and they conducted research together. In 1988, she became a junior faculty member at the Department of Applied Science, City Polytechnic of Hong Kong. Yam enjoyed this challenge as there were no facilities at all for teaching chemistry. She helped with establishing the first chemistry books in the library as well as ordering the first beakers and chemicals.7 Yam's work has taken her to Caltech in the late 1980s. After a spell at the University of Rochester in 1990) she went to study at the Imperial College London in 1991 and stayed until 1992. She was able to work with the nobel lauraeate Geoffrey Wilkinson. Her research turned to organometallic synthesis &quot;studying the luminescence of complexes with metal&lt;U+2013&gt;metal interactions&quot;. She worked with tetraethyllead which at the time was not a banned additives for petrol. This work was on the border between organic and inorganic chemicals.8
Yam has been associated particularly with the elements Osmium, Platinum and Ruthenium.9 She joined the HKU faculty in 2001 where she is the Philip Wong Wilson Wong Professor of chemistry and energy. Yam became a Fulbright Scholar in 2007.10  Yam was elected to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2001, becoming the youngest member.11 The previous holder of this record was Yam's previous mentor.12 She was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World in 2006 and a member of the Foreign Associate of National Academy of Sciences in 2012.13
Application
Yam's research is no pure research but has had recent and aspiring applications. Yam sees the problem of humanity's power consumption as a significant issue and her chemistry has enabled much more efficient displays to be created for mobile phones and laptops. Her work has been used organic light emitting diodes which are brighter and more efficient that the older light emitting diodes. These OLEDs can be deposited on clear plastic, glass or more unusual materials to also create improved car headlamps and larger flat television screens. Yam quotes that nearly a fifth of the world's power is used to create lighting. Creating more efficient lighting will significantly effect the world's power consumption. She believes the internal quantum theory indicates that we may develop lamps based on metal containing chemicals that are 100% efficient.14
Other awards
Her awards include the HKU Outstanding Researcher Award (1999-2000), Croucher Foundation Senior Research Fellow (2000-01), Ten Outstanding Young Persons of Hong Kong in 2002, Outstanding Women Professionals and Entrepreneurs Awards (2005), State Natural Science Award (Second Class Prize, 2005), the Royal Society of Chemistry Centenary Lectureship &amp; Medal (2005/06), and the Japanese Photochemistry Association Lectureship Award for Asian and Oceanian Photochemist (Eikohsha Award, (2006), HKU Distinguished Research Achievement Award (2006/07), Hong Kong Outstanding Women Professionals and Entrepreneurs Award (2008), Ho Leung Ho Lee Foundation Prize for Scientific and Technological Progress (2011), L&lt;U+2019&gt;OREAL-UNESCO for Women in Science Award (2011), and the 13th World Outstanding Chinese Award (2013).1516
Yam was particularly pleased to receive the L&lt;U+2019&gt;OREAL-UNESCO for Women in Science Award in 2011 which established her as a role model for other female scientists. Yam encourages younger aspiring scientific women to ignore the cultural and family pressures and to concentrate on their own ambitions.17
