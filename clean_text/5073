The Greater Crested Tern, Crested Tern or Swift Tern, Thalasseus bergii, is a seabird in the tern family, which nests in dense colonies on coastlines and islands in the tropical and subtropical Old World. Its five subspecies breed in the area from South Africa around the Indian Ocean to the central Pacific Ocean Pacific and Australia, all populations bird migration dispersing widely from the breeding range after nesting. This large tern is closely related to the Royal Tern Royal and Lesser Crested Terns, but can be distinguished by its size and bill colour. 

The Greater Crested Tern has grey upperparts, white underparts, a yellow bill, and a shaggy black crest which recedes in winter. Its young have a distinctive appearance, with strongly patterned grey, brown and white plumage, and rely on their parents for food for several months after they have fledged. Like all members of the genus Thalasseus, the Greater Crested Tern feeds by plunge diving for fish, usually in marine environments; the male offers fish to the female as part of the courtship ritual. 

This is an adaptable species which has learned to follow fishing boats for jettisoned  bycatch, and to utilise unusual nest sites such as the roofs of buildings and artificial islands in salt evaporation pond salt pans and sewage treatment sewage works. Its eggs and young are taken by gulls and ibises, and human activities such as fishing, shooting and egg harvesting have caused local population declines. There are no global conservation concerns for this bird, which has a stable total population of more than 500,000 individuals.

Taxonomy
The terns, family Sternidae, are small to medium-sized seabirds closely related to the gulls, skimmers and skuas. They are gull-like in appearance, but typically have a lighter build, long pointed wings which give them a fast, buoyant flight, a deeply forked tail and short legs. Most species are grey above and white below, and have a black cap which is reduced or flecked with white in the winter.Snow & Perrin 1998 764

The Greater Crested Tern was originally described as Sterna bergii by German naturalist Martin Lichtenstein in 1823, but was moved to its current genus, Thalasseus,This genus had originally been created by Heinrich Boie in 1822, but had been abandoned until the Bridge 2005 study confirmed the need for a separate genus for the crested  terns. after mitochondrial DNA studies confirmed that the three main head patterns shown by terns no black cap, black cap, black cap with a white forehead corresponded to distinct clades.cite journal last=Bridge  first=Eli S.  coauthors= Jones, Andrew W. & Baker, Allan J. year=2005  title= A phylogenetic framework for the terns Sternini inferred from mtDNA sequences: implications for taxonomy and plumage evolution   url = http://www.cmnh.org/site/Files/Ornithology/MPETerns.pdf  format = PDF   doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2004.12.010    journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution   volume=35  pages=459&ndash;469 

The Greater Crested Tern's closest relatives within its genus appear to be the Lesser Crested Tern T.&nbsp;bengalensis, and the Royal Tern, T. maximus. The DNA study did not include the Critically endangered species critically endangered Chinese Crested Tern T. bernsteini, but as that bird was formerly considered to be conspecificity conspecific with the Greater Crested Tern as a synonym of the subspecies T. b. cristatus, it is presumably also very closely related.nl icon  cite journal    last= Mees   first= G.

The genus name of the Greater Crested Tern is derived from Greek language Greek Thalassa, sea, and the species epithet bergii commemorates Karl Heinrich Bergius Carl Heinrich Bergius, a Prussia  Prussian pharmacist and botanist who collected the first specimens of this tern near Cape Town.Higgins & Davies 1996 605&ndash;609

The Greater Crested Tern has about five geographical races, differing mainly in the colour of the upperparts and bill. These are listed below in taxonomic sequence. A similar number of other potential subspecies have been proposed, but are not considered valid.

Description
Image:Crested Tern.jpg thumb Non-breeding adult T. b. cristata
The Greater Crested Tern is a large tern with a long 5.4&ndash;6.5&nbsp;Centimetre cm, 2.1&ndash;2.6&nbsp;inch in yellow bill, black legs, and a glossy black crest which is noticeably shaggy at its rear. The breeding adult of the Subspecies#Nomenclature nominate subspecies T. b. bergii is 46&ndash;49&nbsp;cm 18&ndash;19&nbsp;in long, with a 125&ndash;130&nbsp;cm 49&ndash;51&nbsp;in wing-span; this subspecies weighs 325&ndash;397&nbsp;gram g 11.4&ndash;14.0&nbsp;ounce oz. The forehead and the underparts are white, the back and inner wings are dusky-grey. In winter, the upperparts plumage wears to a paler grey, and the crown of the head becomes white, merging at the rear into a peppered black crest and mask.

The adults of both sexes are identical in appearance, but juvenile birds are distinctive, with a head pattern like the winter adult, and upperparts strongly patterned in grey, brown and white; the closed wings appear to have dark bars. After moulting, the young terns resemble the adult, but still have a variegated wing pattern with a dark bar on the inner flight feathers.
Image:Crested tern444 edit.jpg thumb left First year T. b. cristata

The northern subspecies T. b. velox and T. b. thalassina are in breeding plumage from May to September or October, whereas  the relevant period for the two southern African races is from December to April. For T. b. cristata, the moult timing depends on location; birds from Australia and Oceania are in breeding plumage from September to about April, but those in Thailand, China and Sulawesi have this appearance from February to June or July.

The Royal Tern is similar in size to this species, but has a heavier build, broader wings, a paler back and a blunter, more orange bill. The Greater Crested often associates with the Lesser Crested Tern, but is 25%&nbsp;larger than the latter, with a proportionately longer bill, longer and heavier head, and bulkier body. Lesser Crested Tern has an orange-tinted bill, and in immature plumage it is much less variegated than Greater Crested.

The Greater Crested Tern is highly bird vocalization vocal, especially at its breeding grounds. The territorial advertising call is a loud, raucous, crow crow-like kerrak. Other calls include a korrkorrkorr given at the nest by anxious or excited birds, and a hard wep wep in flight.

Distribution and habitat
Image:Little Tern with Crested Terns-2008-30-07.jpg thumb Roosting with Little Terns, note size difference
The Greater Crested Tern occurs in tropical and warm temperate coastal parts of the Old World from South Africa around the Indian Ocean to the Pacific and Australia. The subspecies T. b. bergii and T. b. enigma breed in Southern Africa from Namibia to Tanzania, and possibly on islands around Madagascar. There is then a break in the breeding distribution of this species until Somalia and the Red Sea, and another discontinuity further east in southern India.

The Greater Crested Tern breeds on many islands in the Indian Ocean including Aldabra and Etoile in the Seychelles, the Chagos Archipelago, and Rodrigues island Rodrigues.cite book    title=Birds of Seychelles    first= Adrian     last = Skerrett    coauthors = Bullock, I & Disley, T.    publisher = Christopher Helm    Location = London  date = 2001    id = ISBN 0713639733    page = 230    There are colonies on numerous Pacific islands, including Kiribati, Fiji, Tonga, the Society Islands and the Tuamotus.cite book    title=The Birds of Hawaii and the Tropical Pacific    first= H. Douglas    last = Pratt    coauthors = Bruner, P & Berrett, D.    publisher = Princeton University Press   location = Princeton  date = 1987    id = ISBN 0691084025    page = 178   

The nests are located on lowlying sandy, rocky, or coral islands, sometimes amongst stunted shrubs, often without any shelter at all. When not breeding, the Greater Crested Tern will roost or rest on open shores, less often on boats, pilings, harbour buildings and raised salt mounds in lagoons. It is rarely seen on tidal creeks or inland waters.
Image:crestedtern2.jpg thumb left In flight
All populations of Greater Crested Tern disperse after breeding. When Southern African birds leave colonies in Namibia and Western Cape Province, most adults move east to the Indian Ocean coastline of South Africa. Many young birds also travel east, sometimes more than 2,000&nbsp;km 1,200&nbsp;mi, but others move northwards along the western coast. T. b. thalassina winters on the east African coast north to Kenya and Somalia and may move as far south as Durban. Populations of T. b. velox breeding from the Persian Gulf eastwards appear to be sedentary or dispersive rather than truly bird migration migratory, but those breeding in the Red Sea winter south along the east African coast to Kenya. T. b. cristata mostly stays within 400&nbsp;km 260&nbsp;mi of its colonies, but some birds wander up to around 1,000&nbsp;km 600&nbsp;mi. This species has occurred as a vagrant to Hawaii,cite book   last = American Ornithologists' Union  title= http://www.aou.org/checklist/pdf/AOUchecklistGall-Charad.pdf Check-list of North American Birds  format = PDF extract  publisher= American Ornithologists' Union  location=Washington, D.C.  year=1998  edition=7th edition  isbn=189127600X   pages = 198 New Zealand,cite web  author = Robertson C.J.R.; Medway, D.

Behaviour
Breeding
Image:Crested Tern courtship.jpg thumb T. b. cristata displaying
The Greater Crested Tern breeds in seabird colony colonies, often in association with other seabirds. It is monogamy monogamous and the pair bond is maintained through the year and sometimes in consecutive breeding seasons.Higgins & Davies 1996 610611 The colony size is related to the abundance of pelagic fish prey, and the largest documented colony, with 13,000 to 15,000 pairs, is in the Gulf of Carpentaria in northern Australia, a region which also supports major colonies of other seabirds. Since nesting in this area follows the summer monsoonal flooding, it is presumably a response to fish stocks rising, probably due to river run-off providing extra nutrient to the Gulf.cite journal  last= Walker   first= T. A.   year= 1992   title= A record Crested Tern Sterna bergii colony and concentrated breeding by seabirds in the Gulf of Carpentaria   journal= Emu   volume=92   issue=3   pages=152&ndash;156  This tern does not show philopatry site fidelity, frequently changing its nest site from year to year, sometimes by more than 200&nbsp;kilometre km 130&nbsp;mi.cite journal  last= Carrick   first= R.   coauthors= Wheeler W.

A male Greater Crested Tern establishes a small area of the colony in preparation for nesting, and initially pecks at any other tern entering his territory. If the intruder is another male, it retaliates in kind, and is normally vigorously repelled by the incumbent. A female entering the nest area reacts passively to the male's aggression, enabling him to recognise her sex and initiate pair formation by display, including head raising and bowing; this behaviour is frequently repeated during nesting to reinforce the bond between the pair. Terns also use fish as part of the courtship ritual. One bird flies around the colony with a fish in its beak, calling loudly; its partner may also fly, but the pair eventually settle and the gift is exchanged.cite book    last = Fisher   first = James   coauthors= Lockley, R.

The nest is a shallow scrape in the sand on open, flat or occasionally sloping ground. It is often unlined, but sometimes includes stones or cuttlefish bones. One, sometimes two, eggs are laid and avian incubation incubated by both parents for 25 to 30&nbsp;days prior to hatching. The eggs are cream with blackish streaks.cite web  author =   title= Crested Tern   work=Fact Sheets   url= http://www.austmus.gov.au/factsheets/crested_tern.htm   publisher= Australian Museum   Retrieved 5 July 2008 Egg laying is synchronised within a breeding colonycite journal  last= Dunlop   first= J.

In South Africa, this species has adapted to breeding on the roofs of building, sometimes with Hartlaub's Gull, which also shares the more typical nesting sites of the nominate race. In 2000, 7.5%&nbsp;of the population of this subspecies bred on roofs.cite journal  last= Crawford   first= R. J.

Adult terns have few predators, but in Namibia immature birds are often robbed of their food by Kelp Gulls, and that species, along with Hartlaub's Gull, Silver Gull and Sacred Ibis, has been observed feeding on eggs or nestlings, especially when colonies are disturbed.cite web  author = le Roux, Janine   title= Swift Tern Sterna bergii  work=   url= http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/stats/adu/species/sp324_00.htm   publisher= Avian Demography Unit, University of Cape Town   Retrieved 5 July 2008  Smaller subcolonies with a relatively larger numbers of nests located on the perimeter are subject to more predation. In Australia, predation by cats and dogs, and occasional deaths by shooting or collisions with cars, wires or light-towers have been documented.
Image:Sternabergiisouthafrica.jpg thumb Nominate subspecies roosting with Sandwich Terns in South Africa
Commercial fisheries can have both positive and negative effects on the Greater Crested Tern. Juvenile survival rates are improved where trawler discards provide extra food, and  huge population increases in the southeastern Gulf of Carpentaria are thought to have been due to the development of a large prawn trawl fishery. Conversely, Seine fishing#Purse seine purse-seine fishing reduces the available food supply, and sizeable fluctuations in the numbers of Great Crested Terns breeding in the Western Cape of South Africa are significantly related to changes in the abundance of pelagic fish, which are intensively exploited by purse-seine fishing. Terns may be killed or injured by collisions with trawl warps, trapped in trawls or discarded gear, or hooked  by longline fishing, but, unlike albatrosses and petrels, there is little evidence that overall numbers are significantly affected.

An unusual incident was the incapacitation of 103 terns off Robben Island, South Africa by marine foam, generated by a combination of wave action, kelp mucilage and phytoplankton. After treatment, 90%&nbsp;of the birds were fit to be released.cite journal  last= Parsons   first= Nola J.   coauthors= Tjrve, Kathy M.C.; Underhill, Les G.; Strauss, Venessa   month= April   year=2006   title= The rehabilitation of Swift Terns Sterna bergii incapacitated by marine foam on Robben Island, South Africa   journal=  Ostrich - Journal of African Ornithology  volume=77   issue=1&ndash;2   pages=95&ndash;98  

Feeding

Fish are the main food of the Greater Crested Tern, found to make up nearly 90% of all prey items with the remainder including cephalopods, crustaceans and insects. Unusual vertebrate prey included Agamids agamid lizards and green turtle hatchlings.cite journal  last= Blaber   first= S. J. M.   coauthors= Milton, D. A.; Smith, G. C.; Farmer, M.

Image:Pacific sardine002.jpg thumb left Sardines are a common food item.
The Great Crested Tern feeds mostly at sea by plunge diving to a depth of up to 1 m 3&nbsp;ft, or by dipping from the surface, and food is usually swallowed in mid-air. Birds may forage up to 10&nbsp;km 6&nbsp;mi from land in the breeding season. Prey size ranges from 7&ndash;138&nbsp;mm 0.27&ndash;5.4&nbsp;in in length and up to 30&nbsp;g  1.1&nbsp;oz in weight. Shoaling pelagic fish such as anchovy and sardine are typical prey, but bottom-living species are taken as discards from commercial fishing. This tern actively follows trawlers, including at night, and during the fishing season trawl discards can constitute 70% of its diet. Prawn fishing is particularly productive in providing extra food, since prawns usually represent only 10&ndash;20% of the catch, the remaining being bycatch, mainly fish such as Apogonidae cardinalfish and Goby gobies. 

A study of an area of the Great Barrier Reef where the number of breeding Great Crested Terns has grown ten-fold, probably due to extra food from  trawl bycatch by-catch, suggested that Lesser Crested and Sooty Terns have moved away and now breed on a part of the reef where fishing is banned. It is possible that the large increase in the number of Greater Crested Terns may have affected other species through competition for food and nesting sites.cite journal    last= Blaber   first= S.

Status
The Greater Crested Tern has a widespread distribution range, estimated at 1&ndash;10&nbsp;million square kilometres 0.4&ndash;3.8&nbsp;million square miles. The population has not been quantified, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for either the size criterion fewer than 10,000 mature individuals or the population decline criterion declining more than 30%&nbsp;in ten years or three generations of the IUCN Red List. For these reasons, the species is evaluated as being of Least Concern at the global level. However, there are concerns for populations in some areas such as the Gulf of Thailand where the species no longer breeds, and in Indonesia where egg harvesting has caused declines.
