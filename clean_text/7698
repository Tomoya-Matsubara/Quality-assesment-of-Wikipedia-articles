Love Land was a sex theme park under construction in Chongqing, China. The park was to include displays of giant genitalia and naked bodies, and host an exhibition on the history of sex along with sex technique workshops.1 It was originally due to be opened in October 2009, but was demolished in May 2009, as it was deemed to be a negative influence on Chinese society.234
