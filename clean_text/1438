Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; Giselle Knowles ( ; born September 4, 1981), often known simply as Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;, is an American R&amp;B recording artist, actress and fashion designer. Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she enrolled in various performing arts schools and was first exposed to singing and dancing competitions as a child. Knowles rose to fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of the R&amp;B girl group Destiny's Child, one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time.
During the hiatus of Destiny's Child, Knowles released her debut solo album Dangerously in Love in 2003, which spawned the number-one hits &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and &quot;Baby Boy&quot; and became one of the most successful albums of that year, earning her a then record-tying five Grammy Awards.1 Following the group's disbandment in 2005, Knowles released her second solo album, B'Day in 2006. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and included the hits &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Liar&quot;. Her third solo album I Am... Sasha Fierce was released in 2008, and included the anthemic &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot;. The album earned Knowles six Grammys at the 52nd Grammy Awards, breaking the record for most Grammy Awards won by a female artist in one night.23 In 2011, Knowles released her fourth studio album 4, which became her fourth consecutive solo number-one album on the Billboard 200. This made Knowles the second female artist and third artist overall, to have her first four studio albums debut atop the chart.
Apart from her work in music, Knowles has also launched a career in acting. In 2001, she made her debut in the musical film Carmen: A Hip Hopera, prior to appearing in major films, including Dreamgirls (2006), which earned her two Golden Globe nominations, and Cadillac Records (2008). In 2004, Knowles and her mother introduced their family's fashion line, House of Der&lt;U+00E9&gt;on; Knowles has also endorsed brands such as Pepsi, Tommy Hilfiger, Armani and L'Or&lt;U+00E9&gt;al. In June 2010, Knowles was ranked second on Forbes list of the 100 Most Powerful and Influential celebrities in the world,45 and first on its list of the Most Powerful and Influential musicians in the world.6

Life and career
1981&lt;U+2013&gt;96: Early life and career beginnings
Knowles was born in Houston, Texas, the daughter of Mathew Knowles, a professional record manager, and Tina Knowles (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Beyinc&lt;U+00E9&gt;), a costume designer and hair stylist. Knowles' father is African American and her mother is of Creole (African, Native American, and French) descent.15 Knowles was baptized after her mother's maiden name, as a tribute to her mother.16 She is the elder sister of Solange, a singer-songwriter and actress.
Knowles was schooled at St. Mary's Elementary School in Texas, where she enrolled in dance classes, including ballet and jazz. Her talent in singing was discovered when her dance instructor began humming a song and she finished it, hitting the high-pitched notes.17 Knowles' interest in music and performing began after participating in a school talent show. She sang John Lennon's &quot;Imagine&quot; and won the competition.1819 At age seven, Knowles started gaining attention from the press, having been mentioned in the Houston Chronicle as a nominee for the local performing arts award The Sammy.20 In the fall of 1990, Knowles enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she would perform on-stage with the school's choir.21 She also attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Houston22 and later went to Alief Elsik High School, located in the Houston suburban munincipality, Alief.2324 Knowles was a soloist in the choir of her church, in St. John's United Methodist Church.25 She only lasted in the choir for two years.26
At the age of eight, Knowles met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group.27 They, along with Knowles' friend Kelly Rowland, were placed into a group that performed rapping and dancing. Originally named Girl's Tyme, they were eventually cut down to six members.28 West coast R&amp;B producer Arne Frager flew into Houston to see them. He eventually brought them to his studio, The Plant Recording Studios, in Northern California, with Knowles' vocals being featured.29 As part of efforts to sign Girl's Tyme to a major label record deal, Frager's strategy was to d&lt;U+00E9&gt;but them in Star Search, the biggest talent show on national TV at the time.30 Girl's Tyme participated in the competition but lost it because the song they performed was not good, Knowles herself admitted.3132 Knowles had her first &quot;professional setback&quot; after that defeat but regained confidence after learning that pop stars Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake had also the same experience.33 To manage the group, Knowles' father (who was at that time a medical-equipment salesman) resigned in 1995 from his job.34 He dedicated his time and established a &quot;boot camp&quot; for their training.35 The move reduced Knowles' family's income by half and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments.36 Not long after the inclusion of Rowland, Mathew cut the original lineup to four,37 with LeToya Luckett joining in 1993.38 Rehearsing in Tina's Headliners Salon and their backyards, the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&amp;B girl groups of the time;39 Tina contributed to the cause by designing their costumes, which she continued to do throughout the Destiny's Child era. With the continued support of Mathew, they auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records. They moved to Atlanta to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the record company in 1995. They returned home to start over again.40 This eventually put a strain on the family, and Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s parents separated briefly when she was 14. In 1996, the family reunited, and shortly after, the girls got a contract with Columbia Records.41
1997&lt;U+2013&gt;2001: Destiny's Child era and depression

 The group changed its name to Destiny's Child in 1993, based on a passage in the Book of Isaiah.42 Together, they performed in local events and, after four years on the road, the group was signed to Columbia Records in late 1997. That same year, Destiny's Child recorded their major label d&lt;U+00E9&gt;but song, &quot;Killing Time&quot;, for the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black.4344 The following year, the group released their self-titled debut album,45 scoring their first major hit &quot;No, No, No&quot;. The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, amassing moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for &quot;Best R&amp;B/Soul Single&quot; for &quot;No, No, No&quot;, &quot;Best R&amp;B/Soul Album of the Year&quot; and &quot;Best R&amp;B/Soul or Rap New Artist&quot;.46 The group released their multi-platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as &quot;Bills, Bills, Bills&quot;, the group's first number-one single, &quot;Jumpin' Jumpin'&quot;, and &quot;Say My Name&quot;, which became their most-successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. &quot;Say My Name&quot; won the Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&amp;B Song at the 43rd Grammy Awards.47 The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies.48 During this time, Knowles recorded a duet with Marc Nelson on the song &quot;After All Is Said and Done&quot; for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man.
Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit against the group for breach of contract. Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin appeared on the video of &quot;Say My Name&quot;, implying that Luckett and Roberson had already been replaced.49 Eventually, Luckett and Roberson left the group. Franklin would eventually fade from the group after five months,50 as evidenced by her absences during promotional appearances and concerts. She attributed her departure to negative vibes in the group resulting from the strife.51 During this time, Knowles had experienced depression from an accumulation of struggles: the publicized split of Luckett and Roberson, being publicly attacked by the media, critics and blogs for causing the split-up,52 and a longstanding boyfriend (that she had dated from age 12 to 19 years) leaving her.5354 The depression was so severe it lasted for a couple of years, during which she kept herself in her bedroom for days and refused to eat anything. Knowles stated that she struggled to speak about her depression because Destiny's Child had just won their first Grammy Award and she feared no one would take her seriously.55 All of these events had made her question herself and who her friends were, describing the situation she said, &quot;Now that I was famous, I was afraid I'd never find somebody again to love me for me. I was afraid of making new friends.&quot;56 She acknowledges her mother, Tina Knowles, for helping her out of her depression, &quot;Why do you think a person wouldn't love you? Don't you know how smart and sweet and beautiful you are?&quot;57
After settling on their final lineup, the trio recorded &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film, Charlie's Angels. It became their best-charting single, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for eleven consecutive weeks.58 Later that year, Luckett and Roberson withdrew their case against their now-former band mates, while maintaining the suit against Mathew, which ended in both sides agreeing to stop public disparaging.59 In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Knowles landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, Carmen: A Hip Hopera, starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer. Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet.60 Luckett and Roberson refiled their lawsuit after Destiny's Child's third album, Survivor was released in May 2001, claiming that the songs were aimed at them.61 The album d&lt;U+00E9&gt;buted at number one on U.S. Billboard 200 with 663,000 units sold.62 To date, Survivor has sold over ten million copies worldwide, over forty percent of which were sold in the U.S. alone.63 The album spawned other number-one hits, &quot;Bootylicious&quot; and the title track, &quot;Survivor&quot;, the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. After releasing their holiday album, 8 Days of Christmas, the group announced a hiatus to pursue solo careers.64

During the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards red carpet, on August 28, 2011, Knowles revealed that she is pregnant with her first child.172 Her representative confirmed the news that night.173 The Huffington Post later confirmed that Knowles is 5 months pregnant and her pregnancy announcement had broken the &quot;most tweets per second recorded for a single event&quot; Twitter record, receiving 8,868 tweets per second.174 MTV reported that Knowles' performance of &quot;Love on Top&quot; and the announcement of her pregnancy at the awards ceremony helped the 2011's MTV Video Music Awards become the most-watched broadcast in MTV history, pulling in 12.4 million viewers.175 In addition, data from Google Insights showed that the most searched for term from August 29, 2011 to September 4, 2011 was &quot;Beyonce pregnant&quot; which reached 'breakout' levels - a term used by Google to describe a search with an increase of over 5,000 percent.176 Knowles' announcement of her pregnancy resulted in an increase in sales of her records, particularly 4, which has sold fewer than 700,000 copies as of August 2011.177
Artistry
Music and voice

Knowles' music is generally contemporary R&amp;B, but she also incorporates pop, funk, hip hop, and soul into her songs. While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Knowles recorded several Spanish records for Irreemplazable and the re-release of B'Day. Prior to recording the Spanish titles on the album's re-release, Knowles was coached phonetically by American record producer, Rudy Perez.178
Since Destiny's Child, Knowles has artistically been involved in her career.179 She received co-writing credits for most of the songs recorded by the group, as well as her solo efforts. Known for writing personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions, Knowles has stated that having Jay-Z in her life has changed a few of her thoughts about how men and women relate to one another, which helped her transition from writing songs such as &quot;Independent Women&quot; and &quot;Survivor&quot; to man-tending anthems such as, &quot;Cater 2 U&quot; in which she sings about bringing him slippers and drawing his bath.180 Some of her songs are autobiographical, which she has admitted are taken from personal experiences, as well as her friends'.181 Knowles has also received co-producing credits for most of the records in which she has been involved, especially during her solo efforts. However, she does not formulate beats herself, but typically comes up with melodies and ideas during production, sharing them with producers.182 Knowles was recognized as a songwriter during the run of Destiny's Child in the 1990s and early to mid-2000s. She won the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the 2001 American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Pop Music Awards, becoming the first African-American female and second female songwriter of all time to accomplish the feat.183184 Knowles received songwriting credits in a single year for co-writing &quot;Irreplaceable&quot;, &quot;Grillz&quot; and &quot;Check on It&quot;, all of which reached number one on the Hot 100, the only woman to have written three songs which went to number-one in the same year since Carole King did it in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991. In terms of credits, she is tied with Diane Warren at third with nine number-one singles.185
Knowles possesses a mezzo-soprano186 vocal range that spans more than three octaves. She has often been identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child.187 Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that she has the voice that defines the group, writing that her voice is &quot;velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting&quot;.188 Other critics praise her range and power. In reviewing her second album B'Day, Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly wrote &quot;Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; Knowles is a storm system disguised as a singer. On her second solo album, B'Day, the songs arrive in huge gusts of rhythm and emotion, with Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s voice rippling over clattery beats; you'd have to search far and wide&lt;U+2014&gt;perhaps in the halls of the Metropolitan Opera &lt;U+2013&gt; to find a vocalist who sings with more sheer force...No one&lt;U+2014&gt;not R. Kelly, not Usher, to say nothing of her rival pop divas&lt;U+2014&gt;can match Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s genius for dragging her vocal lines against a hip-hop beat.&quot;189 Chris Richards of The Washington Post wrote, &quot;Even when she's coasting, she soars above her imitators. It's all in her voice&lt;U+2014&gt;a superhuman instrument capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars. Smitten, scorned, amorous, antagonistic&lt;U+2014&gt;Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; sings from all of these vantage points with undeniable virtuosity.&quot;190
Knowles has often been criticized for oversinging. A prominent employer of melisma, she earns frequent comparison to such artists as Mariah Carey, whose vocal embellishments have been known to detract from the melody of their songs.191 Editors from Eye Weekly wrote, &quot;There&lt;U+2019&gt;s no question that Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; is one of the best singers in pop, maybe one of the best alive...[However] as judicious as her singing can be, the effect in sum is still like being hit in the head with a fist in a velvet glove.&quot;192
Influences
Knowles' credits Michael Jackson as her major musical influence and idol.193 Knowles has also named Diana Ross as another one of her influences because &quot;she's an all-around entertainer: a great actor, a good singer, and a beautiful, elegant woman. She's one of the few singers able to cross over into really good movies.&quot;194 Her other musical influences include Tina Turner,195 Prince,196 Lauryn Hill,197 Aaliyah,198 Mary J. Blige,199 Whitney Houston,200 Janet Jackson,201 Anita Baker and Rachelle Ferrell.202 Knowles credits Mariah Carey's singing and her song &quot;Vision of Love&quot; as influencing her to begin practicing vocal runs as a child, as well as helping her pursue a career as a musician.203 She is also inspired by Oprah Winfrey and US First Lady Michelle Obama.204 Knowles says Winfrey is &quot;the definition of inspiration and a strong woman. When I'm around her, I want to stand up straight, pronounce my words right, and articulate.&quot;205
Aside from her influences, Knowles has become a musical inspiration among various contemporary artists, including Rihanna,206 Alexandra Burke,207 Leona Lewis,208 Jessie J,209 Adele210 JoJo,211 Nicole Scherzinger212 and Nicki Minaj.213 Trey Songz,214 Keri Hilson215 and Jazmine Sullivan216 have also mentioned that they are fans of Knowles' music. Kelly Rowland revealed in an interview with MTV News that Knowles was one of the artists she was inspired by while recording her second album, Ms. Kelly.217 Adele revealed to Rolling Stone magazine, that she was inspired by Knowles' alter ego to create her own named, Sasha Carter. Carter is pulled out whenever she needs to give herself a shot of confidence.218 Pop singer Miley Cyrus told Seventeen magazine that she would like to be like Knowles, stating &quot;She is the ultimate woman. You look at her and you don't think, I wonder what her personal life is like. You look at her and you go, that girl on the stage is a superstar. You don't care about anything else; you only care about her music. So I would hope that would be me in the future.&quot;219 Lady Gaga, in an interview for her MTV special Lady Gaga: Inside the Outsidetold, revealed that she drew inspiration from Knowles before becoming famous. She said &quot;You know, I've never told Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; this, but I remember laying on my grandmother's couch crying, and a Destiny's Child video came on. I remember watching Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; thinking, 'Oh, she's a star. I want that. I want to be on MTV'. And now I'm in music videos with Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;.&quot;220 Actress Gwyneth Paltrow revealed to Harper&lt;U+2019&gt;s Bazaar UK that she studied Knowles a lot at her live concerts, while she was learning to be a musical performer in the film, Country Strong.221
Knowles' music video for &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot; has achieved fame for its intricate choreography, which has been credited as having started the &quot;first major dance craze of both the new millennium and the Internet&quot;.222 This prompted a legion of imitations and parodies from men and women all around the world posting videos of themselves onto YouTube attempting to perform the choreography.223 Celebrities have also tried the choreography, including Justin Timberlake,224 Joe Jonas,225 Tom Hanks226 and US President Barack Obama.227
Stage and alter ego
In 2006, Knowles introduced her all-female tour band Suga Mama, which includes bassists, drummers, guitarists, horn players, keyboardists and percussionists.228 They made their d&lt;U+00E9&gt;but appearance at the 2006 BET Awards and re-appeared in the music videos for &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; and &quot;Green Light&quot;.229 The band has supported Knowles in live performances, including her 2007 concert tour, The Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; Experience, and her 2009 I Am... Tour.
Knowles often receives praise for her stage presence and live performances. In March 2011, Jarett Wieselman of The New York Post placed Knowles at number one on her list of The Five Best Singer/Dancers, writing, &quot;the megastar consistently devote[s] every ounce of her to the routine.&quot;230 In reviewing her live show for her 2009 I Am... Tour, Renee Michelle Harris of the South Florida Times wrote, Knowles &quot;owns the stage with her trademark swagger and intensity... showcasing her powerful vocals without missing a note, often while engaged in vigorous, perfectly executed dance moves...no one, not Britney, not Ciara and not Rihanna can offer what she does&lt;U+2014&gt;a complete package of voice, moves and presence.&quot;231 Babara Ellen of The Guardian wrote, &quot;whether charismatic and soulful, or teasing and flirty, Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; is, above all, in charge. Probably the most &quot;in charge&quot; of any female artist I've seen onstage&quot;.232 In reviewing her I Am... Tour, Alice Jones of The Independent wrote, &quot;Watching Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; sing and strut her stuff can feel at best overawing, at worst, alienating. She takes her role as entertainer so seriously she's almost too good.&quot;233 Tamara Hardingham-Gill of the Daily Mail wrote, &quot;many industry experts have been tipping Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; as the next Michael Jackson. While it&lt;U+2019&gt;s far too early for such comparisons, she certainly proved that she is one of the most exciting and talented performers around and may well go down in history as such&quot;.234 
Reviewers have praised Knowles live vocal performances. In reviewing one of her performances, Jim Farber of The Daily News wrote &quot;Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; showed off pipes of steely power. As the song's signature horn riff pumped away, she soared over the melody with athletic ease. The way Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; used her body intensified the sense of triumph. With her hair teased into Medusa-like tresses, a pelvis in perpetual churn and legs long enough to make Tina Turner proud, Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s presence punctuated her singing like an exclamation point.&quot;235 Stephanie Classen of the Star Phoenix declares &quot;Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; is no ordinary performer... from note one, the 27-year-old powerhouse rose above all the gimmicks, mastering the show like a sexy alien overlord princess. Nothing but extraterrestrial origins could explain that voice....[Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;] could perform circles around any other pop star today.&quot;236 Editors from Newsday wrote, &quot;she proves that hot choreography and strong vocals don't have to be mutually exclusive... No worries of lip-synching here.&quot;237
Known for being sexy, seductive and provocative when performing on stage, Knowles has stated that's her alter ego, Sasha Fierce.238 She described Sasha as being &quot;too aggressive, too strong, too sassy [and] too sexy&quot;, stating &quot;I'm not like her in real life at all ... I'm not flirtatious and super-confident and fearless like her. What I feel onstage I don't feel anywhere else. It's an out-of-body experience. I created my stage persona to protect myself so that when I go home I don't have to think about what it is I do. Sasha isn't me. The people around me know who I really am.&quot;239 Although Sasha was born during the making of her 2003 hit single, &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;, Knowles introduced her alter ego with the release of her third album, I Am... Sasha Fierce in 2008. In February 2010, Knowles announced in an interview with Allure magazine that &quot;Sasha Fierce is done. I killed her&quot;. She then went on saying that she is comfortable enough with herself to be all of those things without an alias, stating &quot;I don't need Sasha Fierce anymore, because I've grown and now I'm able to merge the two.&quot;240
Public image
 Knowles has stated, &quot;I like to dress sexy and I carry myself like a lady,&quot; but she has said that the way she dresses on stage is &quot;absolutely for the stage&quot;.241 The media often use the term &quot;Bootylicious&quot; (a combination of the words booty and delicious), to describe Knowles because of her curves.242243244 The term was made widely known by the Destiny's Child hit song of the same name, and has been added to the Oxford English Dictionary.245 As someone who is fond of fashion, Knowles combines its artistic elements with her music videos and performances. According to Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli, she uses different styles and tries to harmonize it with the music while performing.246 The B'Day Anthology Video Album showed many instances of fashion-oriented footage, depicting classic to contemporary wardrobe styles.247 People magazine recognized Knowles as the best-dressed celebrity in 2007.248 Knowles' mother wrote a 2002-published book, titled Destiny's Style: Bootylicious Fashion, Beauty and Lifestyle Secrets From Destiny's Child, an account of how fashion had an impact on Destiny's Child's success.249
As one of the most media-exposed black celebrities in the United States, Knowles has often received criticism that some believe is due to racism and sexism.250 Toure of Rolling Stone stated that since the release of Dangerously in Love, &quot;[Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;] has become a crossover sex symbol a la Halle Berry ...&quot;251 In 2006, the animal rights organization, PETA, had criticized Knowles for wearing fur coats and using fur in her clothing line, House of Der&lt;U+00E9&gt;on.252 The organization said they had previously attempted to reach Knowles through faxes, letters and rallies outside her concerts. However with no reply, PETA confronted her at a dinner in New York.253 During the release of pop singer Rihanna's second album, A Girl Like Me, many critics felt that her image was too heavily similar to Knowles'.254 Some media even claimed that Jay-Z fashioned her to be a replica of Knowles.255 Amina Taylor of The Guardian, noted her as the &quot;Bajan Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;&quot;.256 In 2007, Knowles was featured on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, the first non-model and non-athlete woman to pose on the issue and the second African American model after Tyra Banks.257 In the same year, Knowles appeared on billboards and newspapers across the United States showing her holding an antiquated cigarette holder. Taken from the back cover of B'Day, the image provoked response from an anti-smoking group, stating that she did not need to add the cigarette holder &quot;to make herself appear more sophisticated&quot;.258 Knowles has several wax figures of herself at Madame Tussauds Wax Museums in major cities around the world, including New York,259 Washington, D.C.,260 Amsterdam,261 Bangkok262 and Hollywood.263
In March 2009, comparisons were made between the fashions of Knowles and R&amp;B singer Ciara, when the latter released the music video of her single, &quot;Love Sex Magic&quot;.264 In the video, Ciara is seen wearing a black leotard and metallic glasses, similar to those worn by Knowles in both her &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot; and &quot;Diva&quot; videos.265 However, Ciara stated that her outfits were &quot;inspired by the Vegas shows&quot; she attended.266 In September 2010, Knowles made her runway modelling debut at Tom Ford&lt;U+2019&gt;s Spring/Summer 2011 fashion show.267 In February 2011, LA Times magazine placed Knowles at number twenty-five on its list of the 50 Most Beautiful Women in Film.268 In the same month, Knowles appeared on the cover of the March issue of the French fashion magazine, L'Officiel, in honor of the magazine's 90th anniversary, and in tribute to Nigerian musician Fela Kuti.269 She appeared in blackface makeup and tribal makeup, that has drawn criticism from the media.270 A statement released from a spokesperson for the magazine, said that Knowles' look was &quot;far from the glamorous Sasha Fierce&quot; and explained that it was &quot;a return to her African roots, as you can see on the picture, on which her face was voluntarily darkened.&quot;271

Throughout her career, Knowles has received numerous awards and achievements.
