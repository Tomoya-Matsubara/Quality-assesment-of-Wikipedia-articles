Christopher Greenup (c. 1750  April 27, 1818) was an American politician who served as a U.S. Representative and the third Governor of Kentucky. Little is known about his early life; the first reliable records about him are documents recording his service in the Revolutionary War where he served as a lieutenant in the Continental Army and a colonel in the Virginia militia.
After his service in the war, Greenup helped settle the trans-Appalachian regions of Virginia. He became involved in politics, and played an active role in three of the ten statehood conventions that secured the separation of Kentucky from Virginia in 1792. He became one of the state's first representatives, and served in the Kentucky General Assembly before being elected governor in a race where, due to his immense popularity, he ran unopposed.
Greenup's term in office was marred by accusations that he had participated in the Spanish Conspiracy to align Kentucky with Spain prior to the former's separation from Virginia, but he vigorously and successfully rebutted these charges. Following his term as governor, he became less active in the political arena. He died on April 27, 1818. Greenup County, Kentucky and its county seat were both named in his honor.
Early life in Virginia
Christopher Greenup was most likely born in Loudoun County, Virginia around 1750.1 His parents were John and Elizabeth (Witten) Greenup.2 His early education was attained at the local schools of the area.3 He learned surveying and studied law under Colonel Charles Binns at Charles City County, Virginia.456 He served in the Revolutionary War, attaining the rank of colonel in the Virginia militia and of lieutenant in the Continental Army.7
In 1781, Greenup helped settle the area now known as Lincoln County, Kentucky where he spent time as a surveyor and a land speculator.8 He was admitted to practice law in the county court in 1782.9 Following Virginia's creation of Kentucky County in 1783, he was admitted to the bar of the district court of Harrodsburg and served as clerk from 1785 to 1792.10
In 1783, Greenup became one of the original trustees of Transylvania Seminary (later to become Transylvania University.)1112 He purchased two lots of land in Lexington and served as the clerk of the town's trustees.13 In 1785, he represented Fayette County for a single term in the Virginia House of Delegates.14 When Mercer County was created later that year, he was appointed a justice there.15
During this time, Greenup continued to practice law in Fayette County and pursued various other interests. He was a founding member of the Danville Political Club and in 1787, he joined the Kentucky Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge.1617 In 1789, he helped organize the Kentucky Manufacturing Society.18 Later, he was appointed to the Kentucky River Company, a group dedicated to improving infrastructure on the Kentucky River.19
On July 9, 1787, during a brief return to Virginia, Greenup married Mary Catherine (&quot;Cathy&quot;) Pope of Hanover County, Virginia; the couple had two children  Nancy and William. Cathy Greenup died October 22, 1809.20
Political career in Kentucky
Greenup served as clerk of the first Kentucky statehood convention in Danville in 1784. He was elected as a delegate to the second and sixth statehood conventions in 1785 and 1788, respectively, and was a trustee of the city of Danville in 1787.2122
When Kentucky was admitted to the Union in 1792, Greenup moved to Frankfort where he was rewarded for his efforts on behalf of the state by being chosen as an elector for the state's senators and governor.23 He also served in the first Kentucky Senate.24 Following this, he was appointed to the court of oyer and terminer, but resigned immediately to accept a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.25 He was one of Kentucky's first two representatives in the House, and was elected to three successive terms, serving from November 9, 1792 to March 3, 1797.26 In 1798, he was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives, representing Mercer County.27 He also served as clerk of the state senate from 1799 to 1802.28
Greenup was a candidate for governor of Kentucky in 1800, but was runner-up to James Garrard in a four-man race that also included Benjamin Logan and Thomas Todd.29 Garrard appointed him judge of the circuit court in 1802, but he resigned the post June 5, 1804 to make another run for the governorship.30 Immensely popular, he ran unopposed, and served as governor from September 4, 1804 to September 1, 1808.31 During Greenup's administration, the state chartered the Bank of Kentucky and the Ohio Canal Company; Greenup became a director of the former in 1807.3233 Despite his popularity, however, he was unable to pass much of his proposed agenda, which included provision of public education and reforms to the militia, courts, revenue system, and penal system.34
A Frankfort newspaper implicated Greenup in the Spanish Conspiracy, but he successfully defended himself and preserved his reputation.35 He deployed the Kentucky militia along the Ohio River to defend the state from any threat that might result from the Burr conspiracy, but that threat had largely dissipated by 1807.36
Following his term as governor, Greenup was chosen as a presidential elector for the ticket of James Madison and George Clinton.37 In 1812, he became a justice of the peace in Franklin County.38 He died April 27, 1818 at Blue Lick Springs Resort, where he had traveled seeking relief from his rheumatism.39 He is buried in the Frankfort Cemetery.40 Greenup County, Kentucky was named in his honor, as was its county seat of Greenup, Kentucky.
