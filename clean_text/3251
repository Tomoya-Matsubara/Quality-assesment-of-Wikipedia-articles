History
Founding
Beginning July 19, 1855, Charles A. Colton opened the &quot;Pittsburgh Dollar Savings Institution&quot;3. The first day's deposits totaled $534. On September 4, 1858, Pittsburgh Dollar Savings Institution was renamed &quot;The Dollar Savings Bank.&quot;5
First Office
The Dollar Savings Bank&lt;U+2019&gt;s Fourth Avenue Building was opened in March 18716 and is still in operation today. The architect was Isaac H. Hobbs &amp; Sons of Philadelphia. The building was constructed using 1,400 tons of brownstone, quarried in Connecticut, pink Quincy Granite and significant amounts of Marble and Brass.
In 1871, two stone lions were placed at the front door of the Fourth Avenue Building, as symbols of guardianship of the people&lt;U+2019&gt;s money7. The stately lions guarding the entrance were sculpted by Max Kohler8, each from a single block of quarry-bedded brownstone. A project to restore the lions began in September 2009910.
The Board Room was added to The Dollar Savings Bank&lt;U+2019&gt;s Fourth Avenue Building in 1896 at a cost of $37,98111.
In 1906, the East and West wings were added to The Dollar Savings Bank&lt;U+2019&gt;s Fourth Avenue Building12.

The Great Depression
During the 1930s, the main lobby was redecorated13. Lighting fixtures were replaced, the teller counter altered and the interior repainted.
In 1931, $1 million in cash was brought to the bank office floor to prove the availability of customers' funds during the depression14. During this difficult economic time, The Dollar Savings Bank never closed15. On November 1, 1949, The Dollar Savings Bank had assets at book value of over $100 million16. In 1938, the original vault in The Dollar Savings Bank&lt;U+2019&gt;s Fourth Avenue Building was relocated to the basement of the building to make room for the Trustee Boards Anteroom17.
The vault was installed after the St. Patrick&lt;U+2019&gt;s Day Flood of 1936, which devastated downtown Pittsburgh. The Dollar Savings Bank wanted a new vault that was not only fireproof but also flood-proof.
