Gil Green (1906 - 1997) was a leading figure in the Communist Party of the United States of America until 1991. He is best remembered as the leader of the party's youth section, the Young Communist League during the tumultuous decade of the 1930s.
Biography
Early years
Gil Green was born Gilbert Greenberg in Chicago in 1906.1 His parents were working class Jewish immigrants from the Russian empire.2
Political career
Green joined the Young Communist League in 1924 and rose through its ranks, becoming its national secretary in 1931.3 In 1935 Green was named one of three communist youth leaders named to the Executive Committee of the Communist International in Moscow.4
Later in 1935, the 6th World Congress of the Young Communist International (YCI) elected Green to the Executive Committee and Secretariat of that body.5
Green remained a prominent youth leader of the American Communist Party throughout the depression decade, attending the 1936 World Youth Congress held in Geneva and serving as one of three YCI delegates to a meeting with the rival Socialist Youth International that drew up a unity agreement with regards to aiding the Spanish Republic in the ongoing Spanish Civil War.6 Green was also a delegate to the 1938 World Youth Congress held in the United States at Vassar College.7
Leaving the communist youth movement at the end of the decade, Green was selected as a member of the National Board of the Communist Party, USA.8 He served as the party's top official, the district organizer, of the key party districts of New York (1941-1945, 1966-1968) and Illinois.9
Green's status as a top official of the Communist Party made him a target for prosecution during the McCarthy era. Green was indicted in July 1948 under the Smith Act and convicted and sentenced to a long term of imprisonment after a lengthy 1949 trial.10 Green elected to become a fugitive from justice, remaining in the underground until voluntarily surrendering to authorities on February 27, 1956,11 Thereafter, Green was incarcerated in federal prison until July 29, 1961.12
In 1991, following the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union, Green left the party and helped found the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism.
Death and legacy
Green died on May 4, 1997 at a nursing home in Ann Arbor, Michigan.13 He was 90 years old at the time of his death.
Green's papers reside at the Tamiment Library of New York University in New York City.
