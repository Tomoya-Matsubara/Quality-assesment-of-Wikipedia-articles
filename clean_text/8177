&quot;Easy&quot; is a song by English girl group Sugababes from their first compilation album, Overloaded: The Singles Collection (2006). It was written by group members Keisha Buchanan, Heidi Range and Amelle Berrabah, in collaboration with Jason Pebworth and George Astasio of Orson. The song was produced by Brio Taliaferro, Pebworth and Astasio. Sugababes collaborated with the members of Orson upon their learning of the group's greatest hits release. &quot;Easy&quot; was released as the lead single from the album on 6 November 2006, in both CD single and digital download formats. &quot;Easy&quot; is an uptempo pop and electro song that features a prominent use of synthesizers. The song's lyrical content is metaphorical and features sexual euphemisms.
Critical response for &quot;Easy&quot; was mixed. Some music critics praised the song's lyrical content, as well as the incorporation of the bass synthesizer, while others criticized it as forgettable and inferior in comparison to the group's previous singles. The song achieved commercial success, where it reached the top five in Belgium and Slovakia, the top ten in the United Kingdom, and the top twenty in Denmark, Finland, Ireland and Norway. It also charted in other countries such as Austria, Germany, Hungary and Switzerland. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Tim Royes and filmed in a public toilet at a club in Romford. It features the Sugababes dressed in latex outfits, where they appear in separate toilet cubicles. The Sugababes have performed the song to promote the release of Overloaded: The Singles Collection.
Background and development
In June 2006, it was announced that the Sugababes would release a greatest hits album in time for Christmas 2006.1 The release, subsequently titled Overloaded: The Singles Collection, was confirmed to contain two brand new tracks called &quot;Easy&quot; and &quot;Good to Be Gone&quot;.2 &quot;Easy&quot; was written by Jason Pebworth and George Astasio, members of rock band Orson, in collaboration with the members of Sugababes&lt;U+2013&gt;Keisha Buchanan, Heidi Range and Amelle Berrabah.3 It was produced by Brio Taliaferro, Pebworth and Astasio.4 &quot;Easy&quot; was mixed by Jeremy Wheatley for 365 Artists at Twenty-One Studios, London, which was assisted by Richard Edgeler. Sarah Stennett and Mark Hargreaves served as executive producers for the song.5
Buchanan explained how the collaboration with the members of Orson came about, saying: &quot;We have the same management as Orson. They heard we were writing songs for the new album so they came up with some ideas &lt;U+2013&gt; basically two songs, Easy and Good To Be Gone.&quot;6 Pebworth also elaborated upon this: &quot;Sugababes are looking for new stuff all the time. We went into the studio and gave them a couple of ideas and they liked them.&quot;7 Buchanan spoke upon the Sugababes' involvement with the song by saying that they &quot;went into the studio separately&quot; and &quot;changed things around&quot;.8
Composition

&quot;Easy&quot; is a pop and electro song that lasts 3 minutes and 36 seconds.9 A journalist from MTV UK described it as &quot;a saucy slice of electro with a ravey chorus and naughty lyrics&quot;.10 It was composed in the key of F major using common time at 118 beats per minute.11 &quot;Easy&quot; features heavy use of synthesizers&lt;U+2014&gt;most notably a bass synthesizer, as well as a &quot;grinding electro riff&quot;.121314 According to Fraser McAlphine of BBC, the chorus is reminiscent of songs performed by British girl-group, Girls Aloud.15 Ian Mathers from Stylus Magazine described the first half of the chorus as a &quot;Hellogoodbye/Van She style 80s dancefloor euphoria&quot;.16 The song's lyrical content is metaphorical and features sexual euphemisms.17
Buchanan described the song during an interview that was published on the group's official website, saying: &quot;Easy is a very naughty and cheeky song &lt;U+2013&gt; it&lt;U+2019&gt;s the most sexy song we&lt;U+2019&gt;ve ever done. It came about when Orson had an idea for a song. They played it to us &lt;U+2013&gt; it was just a verse and a bridge and we completely changed the format of the song to make it our own and the result is this incredibly provocative sexy number that we love.&quot; She elaborated in a separate interview: &quot;When we started working with the guys from Orson the sound just blew us away &lt;U+2013&gt; it's completely fresh sounding but at the same time has the same qualities as the biggest songs of our career, so it's perfect for this album!&quot;18

The Sugababes recorded a B-side for the single, titled &quot;Shake It&quot;.

Release
&quot;Easy&quot; was released on 6 November 2006,19 one week prior to the release of Overloaded: The Singles Collection.20 Range clarified the song's release, saying: &quot;As soon as we heard the track we loved it and knew it had to be the single to launch the Singles Collection&quot;.21 The digital download was released on the iTunes Store on 6 November 2006.22 The CD single was released on the same day, although features a B-side titled &quot;Shake It&quot;.23 Another CD version of &quot;Easy&quot; contains a Seamus Haji &amp; Paul Emanuel remix of the song, a dubstremental version of this remix, and a live V Festival performance of the group's 2003 number one hit &quot;Hole in the Head&quot;.24 An Ultrabeat remix of the song was released on iTunes on 4 December 2006.2526
Response
Critical reception
&quot;Easy&quot; received positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Betty Clarke of The Guardian described the song as &quot;synth-heavy sauciness&quot;.27 John Dingwall from Daily Record gave the song full-five star rating, describing it as a &quot;funky pop grower which beats many of the American acts at their own game&quot;.28 Stuart McCaighy of This Is Fake DIY wrote it &quot;thrills with its edge electro bass&quot;, and that the Sugababes &quot;come over all seductive with the most transparently obvious lyrical euphemisms heard in a long time.&quot;29 A journalist from Contactmusic.com regarded it as &quot;smart, sexy and danceable, packed with hooks and undeniably fun.&quot;30 They described the verses as &quot;low-slung&quot; and the chorus as an &quot;un-second guessable blast of pure pop&quot;.31 However, Cameron Adamns of the Herald Sun criticized the song as having &quot;none of the charm or sass&quot; of the other songs on the album.32 Tim Finney of Pitchfork Media had a similar response to the song, writing that it attempts to &quot;reverse engineer the brand of cool that is commonly given to them via a limpid and largely tuneless rock-pop hybrid&quot;.33 Adam Webb of Yahoo! Music regarded the song as &quot;forgettable&quot;.34

The video begins with a scene of red nail polish dripping from a bottle. It then cuts to Buchanan, who is lying and tapping her foot against the floor. She begins to start feeling her body. In the next scene, Range is seen standing in front of a mirror with a red lollipop, where she later begins to dance against the sink. Next, all the Sugababes are featured in separate toilet cubicles where they have their hands against the walls. The video cuts to Berrabah walking towards a hand dryer, which she rotates towards her face, causing her hair to be blown. Following this, Range sits on a couch and uses the nail polish to colour her nails. The group is again seen in the cubicles, where they repeatedly open and close the doors.

The final scene shows the group in front of the cubicles where they begin dancing robotically.58
