Heaton's name was in an advertisement in the Los Angeles Times (17 August 2006) that condemned Hamas and Hezbollah and supported Israel in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict.13
In October 2006, Heaton appeared in a commercial opposing a Missouri state constitutional amendment concerning embryonic stem cell research, which subsequently passed. The advertisement was a response to the election of Democratic Senate hopeful Claire McCaskill and ran at about the same time as Michael J. Fox's controversial advertisement supporting the amendment.14 Appearing with Heaton were actor Jim Caviezel, pitcher Jeff Suppan, then of the St. Louis Cardinals, Mike Sweeney of the Seattle Mariners and quarterback Kurt Warner, formerly of the St. Louis Rams and the Arizona Cardinals.15 Following a public outcry, Heaton later said she regretted doing the ad and sent an apology to Fox, claiming she wasn't aware of Fox's ad before she did hers. Fox accepted her apology and later stated that &lt;U+201C&gt;If we can have a healthy dialogue about issues that people see differently, that&lt;U+2019&gt;s marvelous.&lt;U+201D&gt;16
