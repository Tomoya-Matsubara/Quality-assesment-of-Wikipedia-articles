 The decline of Detroit refers to the continuing major economic and demographic decline the city of Detroit has gone through in recent decades. The population of the city has fallen from a high of 1,850,000 in 1950 to 710,000 in 2010. Some of the highest crime rates in the United States are now occurring in Detroit, and huge areas of the city are in a state of severe urban decay.
Contributors to decline

The deindustrialization of Detroit has been a major factor in the population decline of the city.1 It is thought by some that the decline was sparked by race-based city policies which caused more affluent whites to leave the city, reducing the tax base, and leading to fewer employment opportunities and customers in the city.2
1950s job losses
In the postwar period, the city had lost nearly 150,000 jobs to the suburbs. Factors were a combination of changes in technology, increased automation, consolidation of the auto industry, taxation policies, the need for different kinds of manufacturing space, and the construction of the highway system that eased transportation. Major companies like Packard, Hudson, and Studebaker, as well as hundreds of smaller companies, went out of business. In the 1950s, the unemployment rate hovered near 10 percent.
1967 Detroit riot

The summer of 1967 saw five days of African American riots in Detroit.34 Over the period of five days, forty-three people died, of whom 33 were black and ten white. There were 467 injured: 182 civilians, 167 Detroit police officers, 83 Detroit firefighters, 17 National Guard troops, 16 State Police officers, 3 U.S. Army soldiers.
2,509 stores looted or burned, 388 families rendered homeless or displaced and 412 buildings burned or damaged enough to be demolished. Dollar losses from arson and looting ranged from $40 million to $80 million.5

After the riots, thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods, and the affected district lay in ruins for decades.6
Of the 1967 riots, Coleman Young, Detroit's first black mayor, wrote in 1994:

According to (African American) economist Thomas Sowell:

Before the ghetto riot of 1967, Detroit's black population had the highest rate of home-ownership of any black urban population in the country, and their unemployment rate was just 3.4 percent. It was not despair that fueled the riot. It was the riot which marked the beginning of the decline of Detroit to its current state of despair. Detroit's population today is only half of what it once was, and its most productive people have been the ones who fled.7

1970s and 1980s
The departure of middle class whites left blacks in control of a city suffering from an inadequate tax base, too few jobs, and swollen welfare rolls.8 According to Chafets, &quot;Among the nation&lt;U+2019&gt;s major cities, Detroit was at or near the top of unemployment, poverty per capita, and infant mortality throughout the 1980s.&quot;9
Detroit became notorious for violent crime in the 1970s and 1980s. Dozens of violent black street gangs gained control of the city's large drug trade, which began with the heroin epidemic of the 1970s and grew into the larger crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s. There were numerous major criminal gangs that were founded in Detroit and dominated the drug trade at various times; most were short-lived. They included The Errol Flynns (east side), Nasty Flynns (later the NF Bangers) and Black Killers and the drug consortiums of the 1980s such as Young Boys Inc., Pony Down, Best Friends, Black Mafia Family and the Chambers Brothers.10 The Young Boys were innovative, opening franchises in other cities, using youth too young to be prosecuted, promoting brand names, and unleashing extreme brutality to frighten away rivals.11
Several times during the 1970s and 1980s Detroit was named the arson capital of America, and repeatedly the murder capital of America. Often Detroit was listed by FBI crime statistics as the &quot;most dangerous city in America&quot; during this time. Crime rates in Detroit peaked in 1991 at more than 2,700 violent crimes per 100,000 people.12 Population decline left abandoned buildings that have become magnets for drugs, arson, and other crime.
Around Halloween, a traditional day for pranks in late October, Detroit youth went on a rampage called &quot;Devil's Night&quot; in the 1980s. A tradition of light-hearted minor vandalism, such as soaping windows, had emerged in the 1930s, but by the 1980s it had become, said Mayor Coleman, &quot;a vision from hell.&quot;13
The arson primarily took place in the inner city, but surrounding suburbs were often affected as well. The crimes became increasingly more destructive. Over 800 fires were set in the peak year 1984, overwhelming the city's fire department. Hundreds of vacant homes across the city were set ablaze by arsonists. The fires continued to happen but the number was sharply reduced by razing thousands of abandoned houses that often were used to sell drugs as well--5000 in 1989-90 alone. Every year the city mobilizes &quot; Angel's Night,&quot; with tens of thousands of volunteers patrolling areas at high risk .1415
Problems
Population decline

 Long a major population center, Detroit has been going through a major reduction in population; the city has lost about 60% of its population since the 1950s.16 Detroit reached its population peak in the 1950 census at over 1.8 million people, and decreased in population with each subsequent census; as of the 2010 census, the city has just over 700,000 residents, adding up to a total loss of 60% of the population.1718
A major change in the racial composition of the city also occurred over that same period; from 1950 to 2010 the black/white percentage of population went from 16.2%/83.6% to 82.7%/10.6%.19 Approximately 1,400,000 of the 1,600,000 white people in Detroit after World War II have left the city, with many going to the suburbs.20
Crime

 Detroit has serious problems with crime; the crime rate is one of the highest in the United States, with a rate of 62.18 per 1,000 residents for property crimes, and 16.73 per 1,000 for violent crimes (compared to national figures of 32 per 1,000 for property crimes and 5 per 1,000 for violent crime in 2008).21 Nearly two-thirds of all murders in Michigan in 2008 occurred in Detroit.22 In 2012 Detroit was the most dangerous city in the United States for the fourth year in a row.23
According to a 2007 analysis, Detroit officials noted that about 65 to 70 percent of homicides in the city were drug related.24 The rate of unsolved murders in the city is at roughly 70%.25 A Forbes report said that Detroit was the most dangerous city in the United States for the 4th year in a row, citing data from a 2010 survey by the FBI; their findings concluded that the city's metropolitan area had a significant rate of violent crimes: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.26
Urban decay

The Film Exchange Building in 2012.

A significant percentage of housing parcels in the city are vacant, with abandoned lots making up more than half of total residential lots in many large portions of the city.27 With at least 70,000 abandoned buildings, 31,000 empty houses, and 90,000 vacant lots, Detroit has become notorious for its urban blight.2829
Detroit has been described by some as a ghost town.3031 Parts of the city are so thoroughly abandoned they have been described as looking like farmland or even completely wild.32
To attempt to improve stability, there are hopes to concentrate Detroit's remaining population into certain areas to improve the delivery of essential city services which the city has had significant difficulty providing (policing, fire protection, schooling, trash removal, snow removal, lighting, etc).33
The average price of homes sold in Detroit in 2012 was $7,500; 47 houses in Detroit were listed for $500 or less, with five properties listed for $1.34 Despite the extremely low price of Detroit properties, most of the properties have been on the market for more than a year as buyers balk at the boarded up, abandoned houses of Detroit.35 Detroit&lt;U+2019&gt;s unpaid property taxes totaled $17.6 million in 2012.36
Poor literacy levels
A 2011 report by the Detroit Regional Workforce Fund stated that 47 percent of Detroiters are &lt;U+201D&gt;functionally illiterate.&lt;U+201D&gt;37 The Fund&lt;U+2019&gt;s Director, Karen Tyler-Ruiz, explained how this manifested itself: &quot;Not able to fill out basic forms, for getting a job - those types of basic everyday things. Reading a prescription; what&lt;U+2019&gt;s on the bottle, how many you should take. Just your basic everyday tasks&lt;U+201D&gt;.38
City finances
On March 1, 2013, Governor Rick Snyder announced the state was taking over the financial control of the city from the local government.39 The state is requesting a review team to look over the financial state of the city and determine if an emergency manager is needed to take over control of city spending from city council.40
On March 14, 2013, Michigan's Local Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board appointed an Emergency Financial Manager, Kevyn Orr. Mr. Orr assumed his receivership responsibilities on March 25, 2013.
