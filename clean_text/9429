Robert James Ritchie (born January 17, 1971), known by his stage name Kid Rock, is an American singer-songwriter and rapper with five Grammy Award nominations. Kid Rock is known for music that incorporates elements of hip hop, rap metal, blues-rock, hard rock, southern rock, funk and country music.
Kid Rock released several studio albums that mostly went unnoticed before his 1998 record Devil Without a Cause, released with Atlantic Records, sold 11 million albums behind the hits, &quot;Bawitdaba&quot;,&quot;Cowboy,&quot; and &quot;Only God Knows Why&quot;. In 2000, he released The History of Rock which was a compilation of remixed and remastered versions of songs from his previous albums as well as the hit single, &quot;American Bad Ass&quot;. In 2001, he released the follow up, Cocky. After a slow start, his country-flavored hit &quot;Picture&quot; with Sheryl Crow resurrected the album and it went gold as a single and pushed the album's sales to more than 5 million. It was followed by 2003's self-titled release, which failed to chart a major hit. In 2006 he released Live Trucker , a live album. In 2007 Kid Rock released Rock N Roll Jesus, which produced a hit in &quot;All Summer Long.&quot; It was his first worldwide smash hit, charting #1 in eight countries across Europe and Australia.12 Rock N Roll Jesus would go on to sell 5 million albums worldwide including being certified triple platinum in the US.
He has sold 22 million albums to date in the United States, which currently ranks him as the 99th best selling music artist of all time in the U.S.
Musical career

Early years
Ritchie was born in Romeo, Michigan. At age eleven he joined a breakdance crew (referred to as b-boy), called the Furious Funkers. They would dance anywhere they could for money. He saved up his money to buy a cheap belt-driven turntable, and he taught himself how to work the tables. In high school, Ritchie DJed at parties for beer. He eventually joined Bo Wisdom of Groove Time Productions, in Mt. Clemens, Michigan to perform basement parties for thirty dollars a night. It was then that he was given his stage name; club goers dubbed him &quot;Kid Rock&quot; after they had enjoyed watching &quot;that white kid that can rock.&quot; Rock started rapping and joined a local hip hop group, The Beast Crew. They were composed of The Blackman, Champtown, KDC, Crisp and Doc Rounce Cee. Rock became friends with producer D-Nice of the legendary hip-hop group Boogie Down Productions. When Rock opened for BDP one night, D-Nice invited an A&amp;R representative from Jive Records to see him perform. This meeting led to a demo deal, which developed into a full record contract.
Against his parents' wishes, Rock signed the deal at the age of seventeen. Despite his new record deal, he had a falling out with The Beast Crew when he signed over fellow member Champtown (the two have become friends again since). They left his vocals on the tracks of their debut underground album &quot;Chapter 1: He Don't Want Us No More,&quot; against his wishes. Rock later became part of the Straight From The Underground Tour, where he found himself alongside several heavyweights of rap including Ice Cube, Too Short, D-Nice, Mac Dre, and Yo-Yo.
Independent days (1991–1997)
In late 1991 he was picked up by an independent record label called Continuum Records, which released his second album The Polyfuze Method the following year. He moved to Brooklyn to work on the album. It was more rock oriented with Rock teaching himself how to play several different instruments including guitar, drums, keyboard and organ. While the album saw some local college radio success at Central Michigan University with the tracks &quot;Back From The Dead&quot; and &quot;Balls In Your Mouth&quot;, the lead single, &quot;U Don't Know Me&quot;, which failed to chart, and the music video received little airplay on any major music video channels. Kid Rock re-released &quot;Back From The Dead&quot; as a single to mainstream radio, but that too failed as a single. The album has sold around 100,000 copies.
He released an EP called Fire It Up later in 1993. The album was hard rock oriented, but he couldn't get rock radio to pick up on any of the singles, including &quot;I Am the Bullgod&quot;, which would be a hit five years later. He was told that there was too much rapping in the songs. Continuum didn't see a future with Rock after this and released him from his contract in 1994.
He moved back to Detroit where his on-again/off-again relationship with Kelly South resulted in the birth of his son, Robert James Ritchie, Jr. Kid Rock has since acquired custody of his son. He started his own label, Top Dog Records, and released monthly demo tapes dubbed The Bootleg Series, which featured demos of him and other up-and-coming rappers and garage rock bands in the Detroit area. Around the same time, Kid Rock formed his back-up band Twisted Brown Trucker, later recruiting Joe C., who he met at a 1994 concert, as part of the group. In 1995, Rock took a job as a janitor at Whiterooms Studios in order to pay studio fees. When he wasn't working, Kid Rock recorded the material that would eventually make up his fourth album, Early Morning Stoned Pimp. During the recording process he met piano player Jimmie Bones, who was working with Robert Bradley in the adjacent room at White Room Studios. Bones decided to join Kid Rock's band soon after. The album was released January 9, 1996. A loan from his father aided the release. Kid Rock sold 60,000 copies out of the trunk of his car, including after his concerts. With EMSP local success he would re-release The Polyfuze Method as The Polyfuze Method Revisted in 1997 with &quot;I Am The Bullgod&quot;, &quot;Rollin On The Island&quot; and &quot;Rain Check&quot; as additional tracks in March 1997.
While Kid Rock was now popular in Michigan and controlling his own label, he felt he needed to get attention from a major label. He was unaware that in December 1996, Lava/Atlantic Records A&amp;R man Andy Karp traveled to Cleveland to see Rock perform at a small club called The Grog Shop. This was key, because on March 30, 1997, Rock performed a special showcase concert to attract major label attention. While many of the major labels were invited, the only attendees were Karp and Lava President Jason Flom (Lava/Atlantic Records), who had seen him in Cleveland. Following the performance, record executives said they loved him but expressed doubts about the strength of his material. Kid Rock returned to the studio and cut a six song demo tape. The first two songs on the tape were &quot;Somebody's Gotta Feel This&quot; and &quot;I Got One For Ya&quot;. After hearing the two songs, Jason Flom supported Karp in signing Kid Rock to a record deal for $100,000, without even hearing the rest of the material.3
Devil Without a Cause (1997–2000)
In 1997, Kid Rock added drummer/vocalist Stefanie Eulinberg to his band, joining Kenny Olson, Jason Krause, Jimmie Bones, Uncle Kracker, Misty Love, Shirley Hayden and Joe C.. On August 18, 1998, Atlantic released Devil Without a Cause behind the single &quot;Welcome 2 The Party.&quot; Kid Rock went on the Vans Warped Tour to support the album, performing one of his first New York City shows at Luna Lounge on the Lower East Side during the CMJ convention.
Audiences ignored &quot;Welcome 2 The Party&quot; and Devil sat on the shelves collecting dust for eight months. While sales nationwide lagged, his performance on the 1998 Warped Tour in Northampton, Massachusetts stimulated regional interest in Massachusetts and New England. This led to substantial airplay in the summer and fall of 1998 on rock staples in Massachusetts WZLX and WAAF for the single &quot;I Am The Bullgod.&quot; In December 1998, while dj'ing at a club he met and became friends with MTV host Carson Daly, he got an offer to perform on MTV Fashionably Loud in Miami, giving the nation its first real look at Kid Rock. From there, MTV took him under their wing as he performed on MTV's Wanna B A VJ doing &quot;My Name Is Rock&quot; and was the DJ for TRL on the Spring Break Special as well as a judge on Say What Karaoke. This sparked him to gold status by April 1999.4
In May 1999, he released the song &quot;Bawitdaba&quot; to radio outlets, and proceeded to blow up overnight. By June, the album had gone platinum.5 Kid Rock went on the Limptropolis Tour with fellow rap-rockers Limp Bizkit and Staind in the same month, his first major tour. By the time he made his career defining performance at Woodstock 1999 on July 27, 1999, he was double platinum.6 The following single &quot;Cowboy&quot; was an even bigger hit. It was a unique mix of southern rock, country and rap that found its way into the Top 40. Kid Rock helped create one of the most memorable moments in MTV history with his 1999 Video Music Awards medley with Run-D.M.C. and Aerosmith who rejoined to perform the seminal rap-rock version of &quot;Walk This Way,&quot; the same song that revived Aerosmith's career in the 1980s. Rock's next single, the rock ballad &quot;Only God Knows Why,&quot; would be the biggest hit off the album charting at No 19 on the Billboard Hot 100. By the time the final single &quot;Wasting Time&quot; was released the album had sold 7 million albums, Devil Without A Cause was certified 11 times platinum by the RIAA on April 17, 2003.7.
He was nominated as Best New Artist at the 2000 Grammy Awards, losing to Christina Aguilera. He was nominated for &quot;Bawitdaba&quot; for Best Hard Rock Performance, losing to Metallica's &quot;Whiskey in the Jar.&quot;
The History of Rock (2000–2001)
After reacquiring the rights to his early material in 2000, Rock released The History of Rock, a collection of remixed and re-recorded songs from The Polyfuze Method and Early Mornin Stoned Pimp. The one of two new tracks, &quot;American Bad Ass&quot; was released as a single. It sampled the Metallica track &quot;Sad But True&quot;.
On May 27 Kid Rock would perform on Saturday Night Live. He first performed &quot;American Bad Ass&quot;. The second song was an acoustic version of &quot;Only God Knows Why&quot; that featured Phish's Trey Anastasio. Kid Rock would join Phish later in the year in Las Vegas, Nevada, for a set of cover songs.
&quot;American Bad Ass&quot; was used as pro wrestler The Undertaker's entrance song in the World Wrestling Federation for a year. He performed the song in Vancouver Canada on Monday Night Raw on May 29, 2000. During the show Joe C helped Too Cool win the tag team titles from Edge and Christian who had mocked him for being a midget. Edge and Christian got their revenge by stuffing him in a trash can and slamming him into the wall afterwards. The following night Lars Ulrich and Kirk Hammett of Metallica joined Kid Rock to do &quot;American Bad Ass&quot; on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.
From June 30 to August 22, 2000, Rock joined the Summer Sanitarium Tour with Metallica, Korn, Powerman 5000, and System of a Down. Kid Rock filled in for James Hetfield of Metallica, singing vocals on the songs &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, &quot;Sad But True&quot;, and &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; and the turntables for &quot;Fuel&quot;, for three shows after Hetfield injured his spine riding a jet ski on Lake Lanier the day before the July 7 Atlanta concert.
On November 16, 2000 Joseph &quot;Joe C&quot; Callejua would pass away in his sleep from Coeliac disease in Taylor, MI. The disease stunted his growth and forced him to take 60 pills a day. Joe C's final song was &quot;Cool Daddy Cool&quot; for the Osmosis Jones soundtrack. The band made a cameo in the movie as the band playing in the club scene. Kid Rock was referred to as Kidney Rock to go along with the cartoon aspect of being a cell in the body of Frank played by Bill Murray.
In early 2001, Rock inducted Aerosmith into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and performed &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; at the induction ceremony. The same year, Rock landed his first acting role in the David Spade white trash comedy Joe Dirt. His character was Robbie a redneck bully to Joe Dirt who was chasing after Joe's unaware love interest Brandy.
&quot;American Bad Ass&quot; was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 2001s Grammy Awards. Losing out to Rage Against The Machine's &quot;Guerilla Radio&quot;. The History of Rock would go on to be certified double platinum.
Cocky (2001–2002)
 In 2001 Kid Rock began dating Playboy Playmate and actress Pamela Anderson, after the two met at a VH1 tribute to Aretha Franklin. By April 2002, he and Anderson were engaged, but the engagement was later called off.8
In November, Kid Rock released Cocky, which was marketed as the official follow up to Devil Without a Cause. With the era of rap metal on the decline, Kid Rock included several southern rock and country ballads on the album. The first single, &quot;Forever&quot;, featured his standard brash rap-rock sound, but lacked the selling power of &quot;Devil Without A Cause&quot;. By the time the songs &quot;Lonely Road of Faith&quot;and &quot;You Never Met a Motherfucker Quite Like Me&quot; were released as singles the album struggled to reach platinum a year later.
However, the release of &quot;Picture&quot;, a country-influenced duet with Sheryl Crow, introduced Kid Rock to a wider audience. &quot;Picture&quot; was ultimately the most successful single on the album, and was eventually certified gold, with album sales reaching 5 million.9 Interestingly, neither his record company nor Sheryl Crow's wanted anything to do with &quot;Picture&quot; as a single. Allison Moorer remade the song for the single version after Kid Rock released the song against his label's wishes. Once it began to climb the country charts, Sheryl Crow's label caved and the original version was released.10 The song would chart at No 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No 17 on Country radio. The song remains his most successful pop song in the US to date.
On December 14, 2001, CMT aired an episode of Crossroads featuring Rock with Hank Williams, Jr. The episode drew 2.1 million viewers, a record on CMT.11. He would perform for troops in January 2002 on an MTV USO Special at Germany's Ramstein Air Base along with Ja Rule and Jennifer Lopez.
At the end of 2002, Uncle Kracker left the band to pursue a solo career and Detroit underground rapper Paradime replaced him. Kid Rock made his second movie, Biker Boyz, with Laurence Fishburne.
A new direction and move towards southern rock (2003–2005)
In 2003, Kid Rock returned with an eponymous album, almost stripping away the accustomed rap metal sound that he had created, opting for southern rock and several country ballads in the wake of &quot;Picture&quot;'s success. The album's lead single was a cover of Bad Company's &quot;Feel Like Makin' Love&quot;. A media blitz accompanied the single capped off by the VH-1 special called A Kid Rock Christmas, which aired on December 14, 2003. He would release &quot;Cold and Empty&quot;, &quot;Jackson, Mississippi&quot; and &quot;I Am&quot; to minor success on radio. The David Allan Coe penned &quot;Single Father&quot;, became his second charting country song, although like the other singles it was minor hit at #50.12. Kid Rock would be his lowest selling mainstream studio album of his career with 1.4 million copies sold.
Kid Rock was involved in the halftime show controversy at Super Bowl XXXVIII in Houston, Texas on February 1, 2004. He was criticized by war veterans for his choice of wearing the American flag as a poncho.
The following month, Kid inducted Bob Seger into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In September 2005, Kid Rock filled in for Johnny Van Zant, the lead singer of Lynyrd Skynyrd on the band's hit &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; at the Hurricane Katrina benefit concert.13
He performed the theme song for Spike TV's Striperella, which featured Pamela Anderson in 2003, the song was entitled &quot;Erotica&quot;.
Live Trucker (2006)
 On February 28, 2006, Kid Rock released his first live album, Live Trucker, comprising songs from his homestead performances in Clarkston (on September 1, 2000, and August 26 through August 28, 2004), and Detroit's Cobo Hall (March 26, 2004). The album contained the last two performances of Joe C. on &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; and &quot;Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp,&quot; as well as Kid duetting with country star Gretchen Wilson on &quot;Picture.&quot;
He brought Bob Seger back from semi-retirement during his pre-Super Bowl concerts on February 2 and 3, 2006 in Detroit. The two performed a version of Seger's &quot;Rock 'N' Roll Never Forgets&quot; on both nights. Kid Rock would appear on Bob Seger's album, Face The Promise, on a Vince Gill cover of &quot;Real Mean Bottle,&quot; a tribute to country legend Merle Haggard. He would make a cameo in the movie Larry The Cable Guy: Health Inspector and was in an episode of CSI: New York in 2006.
He would induct Lynyrd Skynyrd into the 2006 Rock N Roll Hall Of Fame and perform &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; with them.
Kid Rock and Pamela Anderson resumed their on-again, off-again relationship, culminating in a surprise wedding in July 2006 after it was reported Anderson was pregnant. They divorced 5 months later after Kid Rock stated she lied about having a miscarriage. 
Rock N Roll Jesus (2007–2009)
Rock N Roll Jesus was released on October 9, 2007. The album became Kid Rock's first album to go number 1 in his career, selling 172,000 copies in its first week.14 He made the cover of Rolling Stone magazine for the second time of his career,15 and appeared for the first time ever on Larry King Live to discuss the new album.
Although the albums first two singles were successful on rock radio in &quot;So Hott&quot; and &quot;Amen,&quot; the albums third single &quot;All Summer Long&quot;, would become a smash. It utilized a mash up of Lynyrd Skynyrd's &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; and Warren Zevon's &quot;Werewolves of London.&quot; &quot;All Summer Long&quot; would chart at No 23 on the Billboard Hot 100&quot;
&quot;Rock N Roll Jesus&quot; returned to the Top 10 for 17 straight weeks. Both &quot;Roll On&quot; and the title track were released as follow up singles. The album's final single was &quot;Blue Jeans and a Rosary&quot; which was a minor country hit at No 50.
In 2008, Kid Rock recorded &quot;Warrior&quot; for a National Guard advertising campaign.1617 According to a media spokesperson for the Guard, &quot;the 'Warrior' video will appear in more than 3,000 theaters and on over 27,000 screens around the country. The video and pre-show slides will air before every movie except those rated G and PG.&quot;
Kid Rock performed on VH1 Storytellers on November 27, 2008, giving insight to how he wrote some of his hit songs. On April 5, 2009 he performed a 5-song medley at WrestleMania XXV.
He was nominated for best rock album and best male pop/rock performance for &quot;All Summer Long&quot; at the 2009 Grammys. He lost to Coldplay's Viva La Vida for best Rock Album and John Mayer's &quot;Say&quot; for Best Male Pop/Rock Performance.

Influences and sound
Kid Rock's genre-spanning sound incorporates a wide variety of musical styles and influences, ranging from classic rock and hip-hop to country. Rock's earliest exposure to music was via the classic rock and country albums of his parents.

The &quot;acid rap&quot; style of Detroit rapper Esham was also an influence on Kid Rock's sound.28
