&quot;If I Had You&quot; is the title of a song written by Max Martin, Shellback and Savan Kotecha. It was recorded and released as the third single from American Idol season 8 runner-up Adam Lambert's debut album, For Your Entertainment.
Promotion
Following the release of the single on May 5, 2010, Lambert performed the song on a series of talk-shows, including The Ellen DeGeneres Show on May 191, and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on May 21.2
Music video
The video premiered June 14, 2010 on VH1 and &quot;takes the late-night wilderness party motif of Jennifer Lopez's classic &quot;Waiting for Tonight&quot; clip and adds more lasers, guyliner, thrashy dance moves, silver top hats and outrageously spiky shoulder pads.&quot;3 Bryan Barber directed the video, which was inspired by Lambert's self-proclaimed &quot;psychedelic&quot; experience at Burning Man.4
James Montgomery from MTV describes the video as having &quot;a clearing in the forest, one packed with party people &lt;U+2014&gt; of all races, colors, creeds and proclivities, naturally &lt;U+2014&gt; who are all in the midst of a totally excellent celebration. (Most of said party people are actually Lambert's friends, from his days performing with L.A.'s &quot;Zodiac Show.&quot;)&quot;5 Montgomery states the message of the video is &quot;Humanity can, in fact, put their differences aside and just dance.&quot;6
Also making a cameo in the video are Lambert's friends: Allison Iraheta7 and Kesha. Additional cameo appearances by Cheeks, Scarlett Cherry, Alisan Porter, Brooke Wendle, Terrence Spencer, Sasha Mallory and Cassidy Haley.
