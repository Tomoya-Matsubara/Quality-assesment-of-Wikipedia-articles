IVB meteorites are a group of ataxite iron meteorites classified as achondrites.1 The IVB group has the most extreme chemical compositions of all iron meteorites.2
Description
The IVB meteorites are composed of meteoric iron (kamacite, taenite and tetrataenite). The chemical composition is low in volatile elements and high in Nickel and refractory elements. Although IVB meteorites are ataxites (&quot;without structure&quot;), they show microscopic widmanst&lt;U+00E4&gt;tten patterns. The lamella are smaller than 20&lt;U+00B5&gt;m wide and lie in a matrix of plessite.3
Parent body
IVB meteorites formed the core of a parent body that was later destroyed, some of the fragments falling on earth as meteorites.4 Models about the IVB parent body have to take into account the extreme chemical composition, especially the depletion of volatile elements (Gallium, Germanium) and the enrichment in refractory elements (Iridium) compared to other iron meteorites.5
The history of the parent body has been worked out in detail. The IVB parent body formed from material that condensed at the highest temperatures while the solar nebula cooled off. The enrichment in refractory elements was caused by less than 10% of the condensible material going into the parent body.6 The high Nickel concentrations were caused by oxidizing physical conditions. The chemical variation of IVB specimen can be explained as different stages of the fractional crystallization of the convecting core of the parent body.7 The exact size of the parent body is still debated. Modelling of cooling rates suggest that it had a 140 &lt;U+00B1&gt; 30 km radius with a 70 &lt;U+00B1&gt; 15 km radius core. The fast cooling rates are explained by a graze-shot-collision of the parent body with a larger asteroid. This removed the mantle from the parent body, leaving the shattered iron core behind to rapidly cool.8
Notable specimen
As of December 2012, 14 specimen of IVB meteorites are known.9 A notable specimen is the Hoba meteorite, the largest known meteorite.
