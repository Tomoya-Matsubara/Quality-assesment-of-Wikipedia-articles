Judith Susan Sheindlin (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Blum; born October 21, 1942), better known as Judge Judy, is an American lawyer, judge, television personality, and author. Since 1996, Sheindlin has presided over her own successful Daytime Emmy Award winning reality courtroom series named after her, Judge Judy.1
Sheindlin passed the New York bar examination in 1965, and became a prosecutor in the family court system. In 1982 Mayor Ed Koch appointed her as a judge, first in criminal court, then later as Manhattan's supervising family court judge in 1986.
It was reported in mid-2012 that Sheindlin was the highest paid television personality, making $123,000 per episode of Judge Judy,2 or $45 million annually for the 52 days per year that she tapes her show.34 In October 2013 it was reported that Sheindlin was still the highest paid TV star, earning $47 million per year for Judge Judy, which translates into just over $900,000 per workday.5
Early life and education
Sheindlin was born Judith Susan Blum on October 21, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York to Jewish parents, Murray Blum, a dentist and Ethel Silverman. Her paternal grandfather, Jacob Blum, emigrated from Ukraine to the United States, while her paternal grandmother, Lena Mininberg, emigrated from Russia.6 She described her father as &quot;the greatest thing since sliced bread&quot; and her mother as &quot;a meat and potatoes kind of gal.&quot;7
Sheindlin attended James Madison High School in Brooklyn before going on to American University in Washington, D.C. where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in government.8 She then enrolled at the Washington College of Law at American University where she was the only woman in a class of 126 students.9 She finished her law school education at New York Law School, where she graduated as Juris Doctor in 1965.10
Legal career
Sheindlin passed the New York bar exam in 1965, the same year as her graduation, and was hired as a corporate lawyer for a cosmetics firm.11 Within two years she became dissatisfied with her job and left to raise her two children. She was soon made aware of a position in the New York court system as a prosecutor in the family courts.12 In her role as a lawyer, Sheindlin prosecuted child abuse cases, domestic violence and juvenile crime.13
By 1982, Sheindlin's no-nonsense14 attitude inspired New York Mayor Ed Koch to appoint her as a criminal court judge.15 Four years later, she was promoted to supervising judge in the family court's Manhattan division.16 She earned a reputation as a &quot;tough&quot; judge (though she has disagreed with the labels &quot;tough&quot; and &quot;harsh&quot;17), known for her fast decision-making and acerbic wit.18
In February 1993, Sheindlin's outspoken reputation made her the subject of a Los Angeles Times article,19 profiling her as a woman determined to make the court system work for the common good.20 She subsequently was featured in a segment on CBS's 60 Minutes, bringing her national recognition.21 This led to her first book, Don't Pee on My Leg and Tell Me It's Raining, published in 1996. She retired as a family court judge that same year after hearing over 20,000 cases.22 After her retirement, Sheindlin continued to receive increasing amounts of public attention.23
TV court show: Judge Judy


Judge Judy stands next to a portrait of herself

Origins
An article about Sheindlin in the Los Angeles Times prompted a 60 Minutes special on her family-court career. She was then approached about starring in a new reality courtroom series, featuring &quot;real cases with real rulings.&quot;24 She accepted the offer.
Sheindlin's ongoing syndicated court show, Judge Judy, debuted on September 16, 1996, and will begin its 19th season on September 8, 2014.25 Sheindlin has stated that her show's primary goal is to motivate the public to do the right thing, and to show that each individual must take responsibility for his or her actions.26
Ratings and reception
Judge Judy has maintained preeminence within its genre. Since its debut, it has remained the #1 rated court show27 and regularly draws approximately 9 to 10 million viewers daily.28 During the 2009&lt;U+2013&gt;10 television season, Judge Judy became the first TV series in nearly a decade to attract more daytime viewers than The Oprah Winfrey Show.29 Since then, it has been the highest rated show in all of daytime television.30
The show was most recently renewed on April 4, 2013, with Sheindlin extending her contract through the 2016&lt;U+2013&gt;17 season (the show's 21st season).31 Judge Judy is especially popular among female viewers between the ages of 25 and 54.32
Author Brendan I. Koerner has commented on the popularity of Judge Judy:

Court-show viewers don't seem to want moral conundrums or technical wrinkles. They love Sheindlin's show because she offers them a fantasy of how they'd like the justice system to operate&lt;U+2014&gt;swiftly, and without procedural mishaps or uppity lawyers. They get to see wrongdoers publicly humiliated by a strong authority figure. There is no uncertainty after Sheindlin renders her verdict and bounds off the bench, and there certainly are no lengthy appeals.33

A 2013 Reader's Digest poll supported Koerner's statements, revealing that Americans trusted Judge Judy more than all 9 justices of the United States Supreme Court.34
The program has integrated itself into American pop culture.35 In 2003, VH1 named Sheindlin one of the &quot;200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons.&quot;36 Moreover, references to Sheindlin&lt;U+2014&gt;typically as &quot;Judge Judy&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;have appeared in multitudes of television programs and other media, including ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live!;37 FOX's The Simpsons as Judge Constance Harm (voiced by Jane Kaczmarek); NBC's Will &amp; Grace; UPN/The CW's America's Next Top Model; NBC's The Weakest Link; ABC's The Practice and tapings of the Academy Awards; the book &quot;America: A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction&quot; by Jon Stewart;38 a skit by Vicki Lawrence portraying Thelma Harper/Mama on &quot;Betty White's 2nd Annual 90th Birthday&quot; celebration,39 drag queen Bianca Del Rio portraying Judge Judy on RuPaul's Drag Race, etc.
To celebrate the pending premiere of the show's 18th season, a flash mob consisting of scores of people dressed in judge's robes took to the streets and created a Judge Judy music video.4041 Spawning from her well-known presence in pop culture, Sheindlin has been parodied in the media. Examples include Celebrity Smacktalker's Competition, which features multiple parodies of Sheindlin versus other popular public figures, such as Nene Leakes as shown, Mama's Family{{'}}s Thelma Harper as shown, Tyler Perry's Madea as shown, and The Golden Girls{{'}} Sophia Petrillo as shown. In addition, Sheindlin has been parodied on Saturday Night Live, The Simpsons, The Amanda Show, etc.424344
Awards and honors
Judge Judy has earned Sheindlin numerous awards and honors, including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in February 2006; 45 induction into Broadcasting &amp; Cable{{'}}s Hall of Fame in October 2012;4647 being awarded vice presidency of the UCD Law Society in April 2013;48 being presented with the Gracie Allen Tribute Award from the Alliance for Women in Media;49 being awarded the Mary Pickford Award by the Hollywood Chamber Community Foundation at the 2014 Heroes of Hollywood;50 etc.
One award Sheindlin had difficulty winning was a Daytime Emmy Award. By 2011, her program had been nominated 14 consecutive years without winning.5152 In mid-2012, an article from the New York Post reported that Judge Judy was snubbed by the award show by not even being nominated that year despite being the highest-rated court show.53 In an interview with Entertainment Tonight on May 3, 2013, Sheindlin said, &quot;I have my walls full of Daytime Emmy Award nominations.&quot; When ET's interviewer asked Sheindlin if she thought she'd ever win the award, she replied:




I don't know. You know, somehow it would sort of break the spell. The show has been such a tremendous success that I'm almost afraid to think about winning&lt;U+2014&gt;because so many of those shows that did win are no longer with us. So I say to myself 'you want the Emmy or you want a job? (laughing) Which one do you want?'54




On June 14, 2013, Judge Judy won its first Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Program, having received its 15th nomination.55
Salary
In 2005, Sheindlin's salary was US$15 million per year.56 Her net worth at the beginning of 2007 was $95 million, and she ranked number 13 on the Forbes magazine top 20 richest women in entertainment.57 In July 2010 when Sheindlin's contract was renewed, her salary increased to $45 million per year. It was later reported in October 2013 that Sheindlin is the highest paid TV star, earning $47 million per year for Judge Judy, which translates into just over $900,000 per workday (she works 52 days per year).58 Sheindlin owns several homes in several states: Connecticut,59 New York,60 Florida (to which she travels every winter),61 and most recently Wyoming.62 She commuted to Los Angeles every other week for two to four days to tape episodes of Judge Judy.6364 However, in May 2013, Sheindlin bought another home, this time in the same city as her court show. It is a $10.7 million condo in Beverly Hills, California.65
Longevity and retirement plans
When asked why her court show has so much longevity while most other court shows do not, in the May 3, 2013, Entertainment Tonight interview, Sheindlin answered:




I think people are comfortable knowing my perspective&lt;U+2014&gt;because I think if you try as a judge/television personality to do this kind of job and keep your perspectives, your personal perspectives, a secret, you're not being honest. And I think that the American viewing audience can tell when somebody's not being honest&lt;U+2014&gt;when somebody's peeing on their leg and telling them it's raining. I think part of the reason I was selected to do this job was because I don't filter myself very well. But I was never a great filter of myself even when I sat on the bench in New York. Now sometimes that got you into a little bit of hot water; here they seem to like it. Fortunately for me, I don't have to act. This is it. And if you annoy me, or if you lie to me, or if I feel as if you're trying to obfuscate the truth, you're going to get on my bad side. And that's a side that you don't want to be on.66




On March 30, 2011, Sheindlin was admitted to the hospital after she fainted on the set of her show while handling a case. She was released the next day, and it was later learned that she suffered a mini-stroke.67 In regards to her retirement, Sheindlin has stated that it's up to her viewers and when they tire of watching the program, which she believes will inevitably happen one day. As of the present, however, Sheindlin has stated that fans still seem to be interested and taking something out of the court show.68 Sheindlin admits the court show is &quot;seductive&quot; and hard to give up. Said Sheindlin, &quot;I'm not tired. I still feel engaged by what I do, and I still have people who like to watch it.&quot;69
Other media
Other entertainment industry work
Since the success of Sheindlin's courtroom series, she's been interviewed on scores of talk shows and cable news programs over the course of her career,70 such as Katie (numerous appearances),71 Larry King Live (numerous appearances),72 The View (numerous appearances),73 Donny &amp; Marie,74 The Talk,75 The Tonight Show, Dateline NBC, 20/20, etc.76 On October 17, 1998, Sheindlin made a surprise guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, comedically interrupting one of Cheri Oteri's regular parodies of her presiding on Judge Judy.77 Also as a result of her Judge Judy show stardom, she served as a judge for the 1999 Miss America Pageant.78
Early on in her celebrity on February 21, 2000, the Biography program aired a documentary film on Sheindlin, &quot;Judge Judy: Sitting in Judgment&quot; (later released on home video). This 60-minute documentary captured Sheindlin's entire life story (dating back to her childhood), legal career, authoring career, entertainment career, etc. The special also featured input from those closest to Sheindlin and those who knew her best.7980 More recently on December 23, 2008, Sheindlin shared juicy revealing secrets about her life on Shatner's Raw Nerve, in which she was presumptuously interviewed by William Shatner.81 A year later in December 2009, Sheindlin again told the story of her life, legal career, authoring career, and entertainment courtroom career from an updated perspective in a two-hour interview for Archive of American Television.82 In a free-wheeling 60-minute interview conducted by Katie Couric on September 17, 2013, for the 92nd Street Y, Sheindlin elaborated on previously-undisclosed fun facts of her life story and long career in the family court.8384
As confirmed in January 2014, a new court show conceived by Sheindlin titled Hot Bench is scheduled for a fall 2014 debut. The upcoming courtroom series will feature a panel of three judges debating and deciding on cases brought to their TV courtroom. Stated Sheindlin, &lt;U+201C&gt;When my husband Jerry and I were in Ireland recently, we visited the courts and watched a three judge bench, which I found both fascinating and compelling. I immediately thought what a terrific and unique idea for a television program that brings the court genre to the next level. We have assembled three individuals with extremely varied backgrounds to serve as the judges. They are smart and talented, with terrific instincts and great chemistry, and are sure to create a hot bench.&lt;U+201D&gt; The panel of judges will consist of New York State Supreme Court judge Patricia DiMango, and Los Angeles attorneys Tanya Acker and Larry Bakman. As with Judge Judy, Hot Bench will be executive-produced by Randy Douthit, and produced by CBS Television Distribution.8586 It's important to note that Sheindlin originally desired the title of her personal courtroom series to be &quot;Hot Bench&quot; before producers ultimately settled on &quot;Judge Judy.&quot;878889
Publications
Sheindlin has authored six books. Her career as an author began prior to her courtroom series. Her most recent book, which hit shelves on April 25, 2013, was inspired by one of her advisory catch phrases encouraging romantic partners to be judicious with regards to domestic partnerships. This catch phrase is: &lt;U+201C&gt;There is no Court of People Just Living Together.&lt;U+201D&gt;90 Sheindlin's six books are as follows:

Website
Sheindlin launched an advice-sharing website,&quot;Whatwouldjudysay.com,&quot; in May 2012. According to Sheindlin, the goal of the new website is to share her personal ideas and outlooks on life, have a forum to discuss a variety of different issues, and have a little fun.9798
Lawsuits
Lawsuit filed by Patric Jones
In March 2013 a lawsuit was filed against Sheindlin by Patric Jones, the estranged wife of Judge Judy executive producer Randy Douthit. Jones alleged Douthit and Sheindlin had conspired to permit Sheindlin to buy Christofle fine china and Marley cutlery owned by Jones. She said Sheindlin had paid Douthit $50,815 for the items without her knowledge to deprive her of her valuables,99 and she sought $514,421 from Sheindlin. The suit was settled out of court after Sheindlin returned the tableware to Douthit and Jones agreed to pay him $12,500 and have the tableware handed back to her.100
Lawsuit filed by Judith Sheindlin
On Wednesday, March 12, 2014, Sheindlin filed a lawsuit for the first time in her life. The suit was filed against Hartford, Connecticut personal injury lawyer John Haymond and his law firm. In the lawsuit, Sheindlin accused Haymond and his firm of using her television image without consent in advertisements that falsely suggested she endorsed him and his firm. Sheindlin's producer allegedly told the firm that use of her image is not permitted in March 2013, but ads continued. The lawsuit filed in federal court sought more than $75,000 in damages. Sheindlin said in her statement that any money she wins through the lawsuit will go toward college scholarships through the Her Honor Mentoring Program. Sheindlin further stated, &quot;Mr. Haymond is a lawyer and should know better.&quot; The unauthorized use of my name is &quot;outrageous&quot; and requires legal action.101102103 Haymond later filed a countersuit for punitive damages and attorney's fees, alleging defamation of him and his firm by Sheindlin.104 Haymond insisted that local affiliates asked him to appear in Judge Judy promos to promote Sheindlin for which he obliged.105106
On Friday, August 8, 2014, it was reported that the case between Sheindlin and Haymond settled out of court in a resolution that favored Sheindlin. Haymond will be donating money to Sheindlin's charity, Her Honor Mentoring Program.107
Personal life
In 1964, Sheindlin married Ronald Levy, who later became a prosecutor in juvenile court; they moved together to New York and had two children, Jamie and Adam.108 The couple divorced in 1976 after 12 years of marriage.109 Adam is District Attorney in Putnam County, New York.
In 1977 she married Jerry Sheindlin, a judge who from 1999 to 2001 was an arbiter on The People's Court, the oldest daytime courtroom show on American television.110 They divorced in 1990, partially as a result of the stress and struggles that Judith incurred after her father's death that same year,111 but remarried the following year. They have five children &lt;U+2013&gt; Gregory, Jamie, Adam, Jonothan and Nicole &lt;U+2013&gt; and 12 grandchildren.112
Sheindlin is a supporter of same-sex marriage113 and, although she has said that she is not a supporter of &quot;big government&quot;,114 she has expressed a dislike of the frequent assumption that she's conservative based on her courtroom demeanor.115
