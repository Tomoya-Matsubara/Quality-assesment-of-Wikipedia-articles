Rhythm Killers is the second studio album by Jamaican musical duo Sly and Robbie, released in May 1987 on Island Records. After their prolific output in reggae, the duo experimented with electronic sounds and contemporary recording technology, while branching out into international, cross-genre endeavors during the 1980s. For the album, they enlisted record producer and mentor Bill Laswell and recorded with an ensemble of musicians at Quad Recording in New York City. Along with their live instruments, Sly and Robbie used electronic recording equipment such as the Fairlight CMI synthesizer and electronic drums.
A funk and dance album, Rhythm Killers has a dense sound that incorporates contrasting musical elements and disparate styles, including reggae, hip hop, hard rock, worldbeat, and downtown music. Arranged in two side-long gapless suites, the album's songs are characterized by electronic grooves, striking beats, improvisational rhythms, string synthesizers, and cross-rhythms produced by turntable scratches, African and Latin-influenced percussion, and percussive raps. The album has been noted by music writers for its electronic rhythms, treatment of African-American music elements, and Laswell's densely layered production.
The album charted in four countries, including the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number 35 on the UK Albums Chart. It was promoted with two singles, including the UK hit &quot;Boops (Here to Go)&quot;. Upon its release, Rhythm Killers received positive reviews from music critics, who found its music interesting and praised the duo's take on funk and dance styles. It was ranked in year-end albums lists by critics such as NME and Robert Christgau, who named it the seventh best album of 1987. Encouraged by its success, Sly and Robbie continued their digital direction on subsequent albums. The album is currently out of print.
Background

Sly Dunbar became interested in newer recording technology, particularly electronic drums.

Amid their prolific reggae output as sessions musicians, solo artists, and production duo, Sly and Robbie&lt;U+2014&gt;drummer Sly Dunbar and bassist Robbie Shakespeare&lt;U+2014&gt;opened their own record label Taxi Records and attained a distribution deal with Island Records during the early 1980s.1 After Island founder and executive Chris Blackwell hired them to work with singer Grace Jones, the duo developed a more sparse, robotic production style with funk and dub influences.2 This deviated from their past reggae work, as well as the genre's roots sound and light rhythms.3 Sly and Robbie recorded primarily at Blackwell's Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas with state-of-the-art equipment, which led to Dunbar's experimentation with electronic drums and drum machines.4
After their work with Black Uhuru and the group's line-up change, Sly and Robbie pursued more international music endeavors.5 They branched out into cross-genre experiments with a conceptual, ensemble-oriented approach,6 while developing a mentorship with record producer Bill Laswell,7 whom they met through Blackwell and working on Mick Jagger's 1985 album She's the Boss.89 In 1985, Sly and Robbie collaborated with Laswell on their album Language Barrier, which also had guest contributions from Herbie Hancock, Bob Dylan, Afrika Bambaataa, and Manu DiBango.10 Its recording developed from a track the duo had revisited from their work on the soundtrack to the 1983 film Never Say Never Again.11 The track had been done with electronic drums at Compass Point Studios, but scrapped as a rhythm track for later use.12
A dub album,13 Language Barrier showcased a musical clash between the duo's characteristic rhythms and Laswell's own production style,14 with African jazz influences,15 predominant use of the Fairlight CMI sampling synthesizer, and experimentations with tempo and dub techniques.16 Dunbar was enthused by newer recording technology and, in a 1987 interview for The Sydney Morning Herald, said that he wanted to &quot;be a part of it, not be left out.&quot;17 Although it had a lukewarm reception from music critics,18 Language Barrier was Sly and Robbie's first work to receive international exposure.19 For their next album, they sought to record a like-minded album to expand their audience.20
Recording

Bill Laswell applied dense layering of songs in his production.

After releasing The Sting (1986) and Electro Reggae (1987) as members of their Taxi Gang band, Sly and Robbie enlisted Laswell again to work on Rhythm Killers.21 They recorded the album over a period of three months at Quad Recording in New York City.2223 Before entering the studio, Sly and Robbie originally had planned music and demos to work with, but scrapped them after Chris Blackwell of Island discouraged the idea.24 Blackwell wanted the duo to come up with original material at the studio, as they had been known to do since their early years in Jamaica.25
In an effort to crossover with music listeners outside of reggae's market, Sly and Robbie heightened their experimentation with other musical sounds, particularly funk and occasional hip hop music.26 Despite his eclectic output, Laswell himself had started out as a bass player in funk groups, an experience that inspired him to compose his musical arrangements with a rhythmic foundation.27 Dunbar explained their approach for the album in an interview for Musician at the time, saying that &quot;We're trying to get new fans. Once they come into the funk, they're going to have to come into the reggae, because that's where we're going to take them.&quot;28 Sly and Robbie's direction was also influenced by the supervision of Blackwell who, according to Dunbar, &quot;wanted us to make two tracks, 17 minutes long. So we cut two tracks and extended them, each side consisting of three songs. Non-stop dancing, that's the idea.&quot;29
In the early stage of recording, Sly and Robbie focused primarily on constructing difficult grooves for songs.30 To record their rhythm tracks, Dunbar worked in the studio alone and cut a drum part without having a melody in mind.31 He recounted his approach for the album to Musician, saying that &quot;I just played what I felt, working from a sense of 'now I'll do 103 beats per minute.' And Robbie would come in the next night and lay a bass part.&quot;32 Unlike most reggae or funk bassists, Shakespeare approached his playing as a jazz soloist and attempted numerous subtle variations to his riff.33 He said that his inspiration &quot;comes from God. Sometimes endless ideas just keep coming to me. Sometimes I'll change the drum pattern to a bass line and Sly will play the bass line on the drums.&quot;34 Along with live percussion, Dunbar played Simmons drums, and the duo integrated contemporary electronic music technology such as the Fairlight CMI synthesizer in the album's recording.3536 Dunbar used his recorded live drums to trigger the synthesizer's sampled drum sounds.37
Sly and Robbie worked with an ensemble of musicians,38 including funk artists Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, and Gary &quot;Mudbone&quot; Cooper, reggae vocalist Shinehead, avant-garde jazz musicians Karl Berger and Henry Threadgill, hip hop artist Rammellzee, turntablist D.S.T., and guitarist Nicky Skopelitis.3940 Rhythm Killers was produced by Laswell with his band Material, which included Shakespeare, vocalist Bernard Fowler, and percussionist A&lt;U+00EF&gt;yb Dieng, among others.41 Sly and Robbie recorded songs in single takes and cut approximately 20 tracks a day with Laswell and engineer Robert Musso, who used reel-to-reel tape recording.4243 Laswell also hired violinist Mark Feldman, who was working at a dinner theater in Connecticut at the time.44 He had Feldman read charts in the strings section and play syncopated lines, which he found &quot;a little more funky&quot; than the theater.45 The album was mixed at The Power Station and mastered by Howie Weinberg at Masterdisk in New York City.46
Composition

Rhythm Killers is a funk and dance album with contrasting musical elements.474849 Musicologist Robert Palmer views it as an attempt at &quot;an ambitious dance-music synthesis, with funk the stylistic common denominator&quot;, adding that the &quot;funk ethos - less is more, the groove is the tune - underlies all of Mr. Laswell's work&quot;.50 Although it is not a reggae album, Rhythm Killers exhibits Sly and Robbie's Taxi Records production aesthetic,51 which drew on their cultural connection to Jamaican dance halls and their collective interest in experimental electronic sounds.52 Dunbar was particularly fascinated with the Syndrum instrument, and Rhythm Killers is one of the last albums to feature live drums by him.53 Incoporating mechanized beats, rocksteady tempos, and sinuous bass, the aesthetic presaged ragga music and the rise of digital instrumentation in reggae during the 1980s.54 Similar to Language Barrier, Rhythm Killers has a dense, thudding sound and heavy-handed, humorless tone, but has more recognizable hooks.55
The album's songs are characterized by deep bass, striking beats,56 low-frequency electronic grooves,5758 improvisational rhythms,59 electronic percussion,60 rippling,61 disco-era string synthesizers,62 aggressive guitar riffs,63 and stylistic influences from reggae,64 early hip hop,65 downtown music,66 hard rock, and worldbeat genres.67 The songs are densely layered in a fashion similar to Phil Spector's Wall of Sound production technique.68 Bud Kliment of the Trouser Press views that the songs comprise a groove-oriented &quot;song cycle&quot; that is &quot;heavy-bottomed from start to finish&quot;.69 Similar to the album's funk instrumentation, the guest rappers have exclamatory,70 confrontational tones and percussive vocals.7172 Their vocals are complemented by improvisatory turntable scratches and African and Latin-influenced percussion, elements that produce cross-rhythms on songs.73 Carl Matthews of the Baltimore Afro-American perceives &quot;a noticeable looseness in the vocals and a sort of P-Funk quality to the rhythm tracks.&quot;74
The Spin Alternative Record Guide (1995) asserts that the album &quot;truly broke ground&quot; after the experimentation on Language Barrier, viewing that Rhythm Killers &quot;was the story of late-20th-century black music done as symphony.&quot;75 Music journalist Peter Shapiro observes &quot;a striking collision of urban sounds&quot; in the album's music,76 while Robert Hilburn calls it a &quot;good-natured and unpredictable salute to the liveliness and character of urban pop music in its broadest sense.&quot;77 Mike Joyce of The Washington Post notes its sound as &quot;more punchy and elastic&quot; than on its predecessor and states, &quot;the accent is still on electronic rhythms, but the mood is vibrantly expansive&quot;.78 Music writer Robert Christgau calls the album Sly and Robbie's &quot;Laswellized art-funk statement&quot;.79 He characterizes the duo as a &quot;world pop&quot; rhythm section and writes that their style is complemented by &quot;a chauvinistic variation on Bill Laswell's usual international brigade&quot;.80 Music journalist John Leland views the album as &quot;the continuous synthesis that Laswell promised on Herbie Hancock's 'Rockit'&quot;, &quot;extended in both length and scope&quot;, adding that he exhibits &quot;a knack for unexpected juxtapositions and no respect for artificial boundaries.&quot;81
Content

The album's songs are arranged into a gapless suite on each side, both of which begin with covers of early 1970s R&amp;B songs.82 Stereo Review writes that each side is stylistically &quot;derived&quot; from its respective opening track and distinguishes the two side-opening tracks as &quot;anchoring songs [that] serve as starting points for uninterrupted improvisations in rhythm that build to multiple climaxes while drawing from wildly disparate musical styles.&quot;83
The opening track &quot;Fire&quot; reworks the Ohio Players' 1974 song of the same name into an extended vamp with an irregular rhythm, percussive bass, and piano stabs by Bernie Worrell.84 The uptempo &quot;Boops (Here to Go)&quot; has an uncredited sample of Liquid Liquid's 1983 song &quot;Cavern&quot;.8586 The song's lyrics proclaim &quot;bass&quot; to be &quot;the final frontier&quot; and features vocals by Shinehead,87 whose rap begins with a Howard Cosell impersonation,88 and Bootsy Collins, who advises listeners that &quot;you have one desire and that's to dance until you drop.&quot;89 It also incorporates saxophone and flute passages, a heavy beat, and a whistled verse of symphonic music.90 &quot;Boop&quot; is a Jamaican Patois slang term for a man who spends money for the benefit of a younger woman.91 Both &quot;Fire&quot; and &quot;Boops (Here to Go)&quot; touch on popular dancehall topics.92 The Prince-styled &quot;Let's Rock&quot; features octave-doubled vocals, abrasive guitar, and funky riffs.93
Opening the second side,94 &quot;Yes, We Can Can&quot; is a cover of the Pointer Sisters 1973 song of the same name,95 originally written by Allen Toussaint.96 It eschews the original song's jazz influence for hip hop elements,97 gritty dub, and Art of Noise-like grooves.9899 &quot;Rhythm Killer&quot; features aggressive percussion, vibrating strings, frantic toasting by Shinehead, and downtown saxophone by Henry Threadgill.100 The song was featured in the 1988 film Colors.101 The song's groove transitions into &quot;Bank Job&quot;,102 which has a relaxed style,103 lavish production, and accented electronic rhythms.104

Critical response

Rhythm Killers was well received by contemporary music critics.117 Gavin Edwards of Rolling Stone described it as &quot;a thirty-five-minute dance party full of surprises and strange noises&quot;, and commented that it &quot;sounds like the Great Missing DJ Set &lt;U+2014&gt; albeit one played by live musicians with perfect telepathy.&quot;118 Simon Witter of i-D dubbed it &quot;the year's most enjoyable, perfectly formed dance album.&quot;119 Stereo Review praised the duo's take on &quot;contemporary urban dance music&quot;, calling it &quot;one of the best dance records I've heard in a very long time&quot;, and wrote that they &quot;demonstrate how the best of the past can be combined with current modes to produce music that is both imaginative and readily accessible.&quot;120 Steve Hochman of the Los Angeles Times preferred the album to the &quot;serious&quot; tone of Language Barrier and commented that &quot;this time the fun is as whoppingly big as the beat&quot;.121 Hochman cited it as &quot;one of the most stunning albums of funk&lt;U+2014&gt;or just about any style&lt;U+2014&gt;this year&quot; and stated, &quot;Sly and Robbie have squeezed onto one slab of vinyl the best of the past 20 years of funk, from Sly &amp; the Family Stone through George Clinton, along the way throwing in reggae, rap and even a bit of Rossini.&quot;122
Mat Smith of Melody Maker gave the album a rave review and found it to be &quot;enthused and fused with a ... schizophrenic art of noise attack all lashed around a nonstop rhythm that bumps each track nose to tail tight.&quot;123 The Washingtonian called it a &quot;minor masterpiece&quot; and wrote that its disparate styles are &quot;distilled and mixed to pulsing perfection.&quot;124 Ken Tucker of The Philadelphia Inquirer commented that Sly and Robbie &quot;long ago proved their mastery in the reggae genre, but here they tackle funk music and perform it well.&quot;125 The Nation commended them for assembling &quot;top-notch players to thread through long, driving meditations a riot of sounds from Beethoven and Hendrix.&quot;126 In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau gave it an A rating,127 indicating &quot;a great record both of whose sides offer enduring pleasure and surprise. You should own it.&quot;128 Christgau commended the guest artists' &quot;lyrical signatures&quot; and quipped, &quot;S&amp;R's sensationalism combines with Laswell's imperiousness to rock each side from its Ohio Players or Allen Toussaint intro. Word.&quot;129
In a negative review, Greg Taylor of The Sydney Morning Herald criticized the album's music as &quot;wallpaper&quot; and &quot;a mind-numbing waste of talent&quot;, writing that &quot;the fabled balance of the two players is buried under the flashy hip-hop mix&quot;.130 John Leland of Spin called it &quot;an ambitious and impressively successful dialogue on the crosscultural elasticity of the funk&quot;, but was ambivalent towards its &quot;genre music&quot;, which he viewed lacked &quot;gusto&quot;, and commented that the album &quot;looks beyond funk to a rad thesis; by my ears it never gets beyond its thesis and into the funk.&quot;131 Robert Palmer of The New York Times critiqued that &quot;the insight that funk is the Rosetta Stone of contemporary dance music is a worthy one, but it doesn't necessarily follow that everything deriving from funk needs to be crammed into every tune.&quot;132 Although he perceived an excess of effects &quot;clutter[ing] what undoubtedly began as eloquent, unadorned Sly and Robbie rhythm tracks&quot;, Palmer praised the album's &quot;simplest&quot; moments as &quot;ingenious&quot; and wrote in conclusion, &quot;despite its tendency toward overkill, [the album] contains enough fresh ideas, and captivating grooves, to repay repeated listening.&quot;133
Accolades
NME ranked the album number 25 on its year-end best albums list for 1987.134 &quot;Boops (Here to Go)&quot; was ranked number 18 on the magazine's best singles list,135 while The Face ranked it number eight on their list.136 Rockdelux ranked it number 11 on its year-end list.137 They also named &quot;Boops (Here to Go)&quot; the sixth best song of the 1987.138 Rhythm Killers was voted number 25 in The Village Voice{{'}}s Pazz &amp; Jop critics' poll for 1987.139 In his dean's list, poll creator Robert Christgau named it the seventh best album of the year.140
Aftermath
Encouraged by the album's success,141 Sly and Robbie recorded The Summit (1988), an instrumental ragga album with digital riddims that was decried by roots critics,142 and Silent Assassin (1990), a collaboration with several American rappers.143 The latter album's fusion of Jamaican dub and American hip hop was a precursor to the rise of dancehall in the US during the early 1990s.144 Bootsy Collins, who had kept a low profile for much of the 1980s, followed-up his appearance on Rhythm Killers with a comeback album, What's Bootsy Doin'?, in 1988.145 Shinehead's own appearance on the album bolstered his mainstream exposure as he was receiving American radio airplay with his debut single and performing on an international tour.146147 Rhythm Killers was reissued by Island on 4 June 1990,148 but eventually became out of print.149
Culture critic Mark Anthony Neal considers Rhythm Killers to be an essential album of 1980s underground funk,150 while reggae historian Steve Barrow cites it as &quot;one of the most exciting projects&quot; Sly and Robbie were involved in during the 1980s.151 In a retrospective article, The State writes that they &quot;consistently tried to broaden the role of their instruments, taking the bass and drums to unexplored rhythmic frontiers on albums like Rhythm Killers&quot;.152 The Rolling Stone Album Guide (1992) gives it five out of five stars,153 and in the book's 2004 edition, Rolling Stone journalist Mark Coleman praises the album as &quot;so coherent and smooth that you could mistake it for a suite if it wasn't also so thoroughly down and dirty.&quot;154 In The Rough Guide to Rock (2003), Peter Shapiro cites the album as Laswell's &quot;best outside production&quot; and &quot;an album that fulfilled his fusion/fission concept ... in which some of the finest dance musicians in the world jam on two side-long grooves that imply New Orleans R&amp;B, 70s funk, hip-hop and ragga are all part of the same continuum.&quot;155 In a mixed review, Allmusic editor Stephen Cook calls the album &quot;a valiant venture gone awry&quot; and finds its songs to be monotonous.156
