(also known by its English title &quot;The Creamy Season&quot;) and  (stylised as &quot;The Decisive 3min.&quot;) are the two songs that made up the fourth single by Japanese entertainer Chiaki Kuriyama. It was released on March 2, 2011, as the lead single from her debut album Circus, released two weeks later. The songs were produced by musician Ringo Sheena, who covered &quot;Ketteiteki Sanpunkan&quot; for her album Gyakuyuny&lt;U+016B&gt;: K&lt;U+014D&gt;wankyoku in 2014.1
Background and development
After Chiaki Kuriyama debuted in early 2010 with the single &quot;Ry&lt;U+016B&gt;sei no Namida,&quot; she began to release collaboration singles, featuring a famous Japanese rock musician as the producer. &quot;Kan&lt;U+014D&gt;sei Girl&quot; (2010) was produced by Tomoyasu Hotei, and &quot;Cold Finger Girl&quot; (2011) by Kenichi Asai of Blankey Jet City.2 In 2010, Kuriyama starred in the drama Atami no S&lt;U+014D&gt;sakan. The Ringo Sheena-lead band Tokyo Jihen performed the theme song for the drama, &quot;Tengoku e Y&lt;U+014D&gt;koso.&quot;
Writing and production
The first song worked on was &quot;Ketteiteki Sanpunkan,&quot; followed by &quot;Oishii Kisetsu,&quot;3 which both featured Tokyo Jihen performing instruments.4 The band recorded together with Kuriyama, and Sheena gave pointers to Kuriyama during the sessions.5 Sheena asked Kuriyama to sing &quot;Oishii Kisetsu&quot; loudly and to whisper on &quot;Ketteiteki Sanpunkan.&quot;6
&quot;Ketteiteki Sanpunkan&quot; was written with Chiaki Kuriyama in mind, while &quot;Oishii Kisetsu&quot; was written about a regular girl in love.78 &quot;Ketteiteki Sanpunkan&quot; was written with the same concept as Tokyo Jihen's single &quot;N&lt;U+014D&gt;d&lt;U+014D&gt;teki Sanpunkan,&quot; with a BPM of 120 and a length of exactly three minutes. &quot;Ketteiteki Sanpunkan&quot; was first performed at the Valentine Special Live concert at Shibuya-AX on February 12, 2011.9
The third song on the single is a cover of Anri's &quot;Cat's Eye,&quot; the eponymous theme song for the 1983 anime Cat's Eye.
Promotion and release
Music videos were produced for both &quot;Oishii Kisetsu&quot; and &quot;Ketteiteki Sanpunkan,&quot; both directed by Hiroshi Usui.1011 Usui was a director who had previously worked with Sheena on videos such as &quot;K&lt;U+014D&gt;fukuron&quot; (1998), &quot;Kabukich&lt;U+014D&gt; no Jo&lt;U+014D&gt;&quot; (1998), &quot;Koko de Kiss Shite.&quot; (1999) and Tokyo Jihen's &quot;Kabuki&quot; and &quot;Kenka J&lt;U+014D&gt;t&lt;U+014D&gt;.&quot; (2006)
