The Detroit Tigers Radio Network is a network of 34 radio stations across Michigan and Northwestern Ohio that air Major League Baseball's Detroit Tigers games. 1 The network airs all 162 regular season games, and some Spring Training games.2 The flagship stations are WXYT-AM 1270 AM and WXYT-FM 97.1 FM. If the Detroit Lions or Detroit Red Wings (who the stations are also flagships to) are playing at the same time, only one of the WXYT stations (usually the AM) serves as the flagship for the Tigers. Dan Dickerson does play-by-play on the broadcasts and former Tiger catcher Jim Price does color commentary.3 Games are syndicated by CBS Radio.

History and Former Broadcasters



Before merging with WXYT-FM, WXYT-AM was the sole flagship station from 2001-2007.


The Tigers' flagship station was Detroit's WJR from 1964-2000. As a maximum power clear-channel station, Tigers games could be listened to on WJR from hundreds of miles away on warm, clear nights.


Other former Tigers flagships include WJBK-AM (currently known as WLQV) and WKMH-AM (currently known as WDTW-AM).


The Tigers' most famous announcer is Hall of Fame Broadcaster Ernie Harwell, who called Tigers games mostly on the radio (but also on TV) from 1960-2002.
