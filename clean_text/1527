History
The Sherwood Valley Rancheria is a community of Coastal Pomo Indians, who are indigenous to Sonoma and Mendocino Counties in northern California. Their historical community was called Kul&lt;U+00E1&gt; Kai Pomo, and they traditionally lived along the upper course of the Eel River. They spoke the Pomo language. The last traditional chief of the Kul&lt;U+00E1&gt; Kai Pomo was Lunkaya.2
Russians were the first non-Indians with whom the Pomo had sustained contact. They withdrew, only to be replaced by increasing numbers of European-Americans, who came to Pomo country to farm or to mine gold in the mid-19th century. Non-Indians quickly outnumbers the Indians and wreaked havoc on their communities. A system of rancherias, or small reservations, was established by the US government for displaced Californian tribes, including the Sherwood Valley Rancheria.
Today
Sherwood Valley Rancheria of Pomo Indians has over 450 enrolled members with 179 of them living on the reservation.3 The tribe owns Sherwood Valley Rancheria Casino and Creekside Cafe, formerly known as the Black Bart Casino, in Willits on land purchased by the tribe in 1987.4
