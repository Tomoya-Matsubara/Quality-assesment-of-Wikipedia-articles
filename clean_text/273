Introducing Joss Stone is the third studio album by English soul singer Joss Stone, released in the United Kingdom on 12 March 2007 by Relentless Records. While not as commercially successful as Stone's previous albums in her native UK, Introducing Joss Stone debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 selling 118,000 units in its opening week, yielding the second-ever highest debut for a British female solo artist on the chart. It also achieved success throughout continental Europe, charting inside the top five and the top ten in several nations ans selling over 2,500,000 copies worldwide.
Background and recording
The album's production is solely credited to renowned musician and producer Raphael Saadiq, known for his previous work with the likes of D'Angelo, Macy Gray, Mary J. Blige, Kelis, and The Roots. &quot;Raphael is the most incredible musician I've ever met in my whole life&quot;, Stone says. &quot;Musically, I feel like he reads my mind. I'll give him a look and he'll know exactly what I want.&quot;1 Stone began writing the lyrics in Barbados in April 2006,234 before heading for Nassau, Bahamas, to meet up with Saadiq.5 The two spent two months there recording at Compass Point Studios, followed by the album's mixing at New York City's Electric Lady Studios.6 Other collaborators include Lauryn Hill, Common, Novel, Joi, and Mix Master Mike.
Virgin Records&lt;U+2014&gt;Stone's U.S. label&lt;U+2014&gt;describes the album as &quot;an electrifying mix of warm vintage soul, '70s-style R&amp;B, Motown girl-group harmonies, and hip-hop grooves.&quot;7 Stone herself describes it as &quot;truly me. That's why I'm calling it Introducing Joss Stone. These are my words, and this is who I am as an artist.&quot;8
Release and promotion
The album's lead single &quot;Tell Me 'bout It&quot;, released in March 2007, debuted and peaked at number twenty-eight on the UK Singles Chart, and became Stone's first solo single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 when it reached number eighty-three. Follow-up single &quot;Tell Me What We're Gonna Do Now&quot; (featuring Common), released in July 2007, missed the top seventy-five in the UK, peaking at number eighty-four. The Diane Warren-penned ballad &quot;Bruised but Not Broken&quot;, not commercially released as a single, went for adds at U.S. urban adult contemporary radio stations on 16 July 2007,9 which allowed the song to chart at number fifty-five on both the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs10 and the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Airplay11 in November 2007, as well as number thirteen on the Hot Adult R&amp;B Airplay in October 2007.12 It was ultimately ranked at number thirty-eight on Radio &amp; Records's urban AC year-end chart in 2007 with 9,049 plays.13 The official third (and final) single, &quot;Baby Baby Baby&quot;, received a physical release in the UK on 14 January 2008, but due to lack of promotion and a music video to back its release, the song failed to chart in major markets.
A North American tour in support of the album took place from 27 April to 13 June 2007, visiting sixteen cities in total: Ledyard, Connecticut; Philadelphia; New Orleans; Dallas; Alpine, California; San Francisco; Portland, Oregon; Vancouver; Seattle; Denver; Chicago; Toronto; Montreal; New York City; Boston; and Vienna, Virginia.14 Two months later, Stone embarked on a North American late-summer tour which lasted from 27 August to 29 September 2007 and covered twelve cities: Los Angeles; Park City, Utah; Snowmass Village, Colorado; Seattle; Jacksonville, Oregon; Las Vegas; Mexico City; Austin, Texas; Biloxi, Mississippi; Chicago; San Francisco; and Kansas City, Missouri.15
The deluxe edition of the album includes a bonus DVD containing thirty-five minutes of material including recording footage, interviews with Stone, and the music video for &quot;Tell Me 'bout It&quot;.
Chart performance
Introducing Joss Stone debuted at number twelve on the UK Albums Chart the week of 24 March 2007 selling over 27,000 copies in its first week, and spent only four weeks on the chart, failing to reprise the success of Stone's previous efforts. Nevertheless, the album debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 at number two (behind Modest Mouse's We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank) on the issue date of 7 April 2007 with first-week sales of over 118,000 copies,16 earning Stone her most successful album in the United States to date as well as the highest-charting debut for a British female solo artist on the Billboard 200, outdoing the record previously held by fellow English soul singer Amy Winehouse, whose album Back to Black had debuted at number seven the week before.17 This record would later be broken by Leona Lewis's Spirit, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 the week of 26 April 2008.18 The album earned a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America on 1 May 2007,19 two months after its release, having sold 608,000 copies in the U.S. as of November 2008, according to Nielsen SoundScan.20 It was equally successful in Canada, reaching number six on the main albums chart and number one on the R&amp;B chart, and eventually going gold by the Canadian Recording Industry Association on 11 April 2007.21
In mainland Europe, Introducing Joss Stone enjoyed top ten success in the Netherlands (where it landed at number one in its third week on the run), Switzerland, Belgium, Greece, Germany, Italy, Austria, and Portugal. So far it has been awarded with platinum and gold certifications from the IFPI in Switzerland22 and Austria,23 respectively. The album was less successful in Nordic countries, peaking at number twenty-seven in Norway, number thirty-one in Sweden, and number thirty-eight in Denmark, while failing to chart at all in Finland. With a peak position of number three on the European Top 100 Albums, it ended 2007 as the eighty-eighth best-selling album on the chart.24
