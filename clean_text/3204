Our Lady of Ambronay (fr:Notre-Dame d'Ambronay) is an old Benedictine abbey found in the centre of the French village of Ambronay in the Ain department.
A church was founded by hermits in the seventh century, but this was destroyed by Saracens. A church and monastery was rebuilt around 803 by the then abbot Saint Bernard of Vienne and the facade of one of the naves dates from the ninth century. The church was expanded around the middle of the thirteenth century.
The abbey was destroyed during the French Revolution in 1793.1 The church was saved from destruction despite having been converted into stables, and is once again a place of worship.
The church is regarded as a sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia described it as &quot;one of the two candles of devotion to Our Lady in the Diocese of Belley&quot;.2
Its excellent acoustics have led to its hosting the Ambronay Festival, an international baroque music festival.3
