Nigella Lucy Lawson (born January 6 1960) is an English journalist, food writer, broadcaster and television presenter. After graduating from Oxford, Lawson worked as a book reviewer and soon became the deputy literary editor of The Sunday Times in 1986. She then began work as a freelance journalist. Lawson wrote her first cookery book, How to Eat, in 1998; this became an instant bestseller and sold 300,000 copies. She followed this up with a second bestseller, How to be a Domestic Goddess in 2000, winning her a British Book Award.
Her career progressed in the United Kingdom in 2000 when she hosted her own Channel 4 cookery programme, Nigella Bites, which was accompanied with another bestseller. She also hosted a less successful chat show on ITV in 2005, which was followed by two successful cookery series on BBC Two. Lawson also enjoys a successful career in the United States where Nigella Feasts has been aired on the Food Network. Her own cookware range is reportedly worth &lt;U+00A3&gt;7 million a year,1 and she has sold more than 3 million cookery books worldwide.
Background
Her given name originally being thought up by her Grandmother,2 Nigella Lawson was born to Nigel Lawson (now Baron Lawson of Blaby),3 a Conservative politician and Chancellor of the Exchequer in Margaret Thatcher's cabinet, and the late Vanessa Salmon,4 a socialite and member of the formerly influential Jewish family who co-owned the Lyons Corner House empire.5 According to Lawson, Judaism has played no significant part religiously in her life, but she reckons that she has developed a Jewish character.6 Lawson's parents divorced in the 1980s. They both remarried; her father to a House of Commons researcher, Therese Maclear, and her mother to philosopher AJ Ayer.7
Lawson's school years were difficult; she had to move schools nine times between the ages of nine and eighteen. &quot;I was just difficult, disruptive, good at school work, but rude, I suspect, and too highly-strung,&quot; Lawson commented.8 With Lawson's father being a prominent politician, one of the things she found most irritating was the many judgements and pre-conceptions about her.9 Lawson attended Overstone School, Northamptonshire, Godolphin and Latymer School and Westminster School before graduating from Oxford,10 with a degree in medieval and modern languages.11 She also lived in Florence for a period.12
Her mother died of liver cancer at the age of forty-eight in 1985, when Lawson was just twenty-five.1314 Her siblings include her late sister Thomasina, who died of breast cancer in 1993 during her early thirties;1516 another sister, Horatia; and a brother, Dominic, former editor of The Sunday Telegraph and The Spectator.17
Lawson took part in the third series of the BBC family-history documentary series, Who Do You Think You Are?, in order to uncover some of her family's history.18 She traced her mother's side of the family, the Salmon (originally Solomons) family (owners of J. Lyons and Co.) to Ashkenazi Jewish ancestors in the Netherlands and the Rhineland of Prussia, Germany.19 One of these ancestors, Coenraad Sammes (later Coleman Joseph), had fled to England to escape a prison sentence following a conviction for theft.2021 Lawson was disappointed and surprised not to have Iberian-Sephardi ancestry in her family.22 The episode first broadcast on 11 October 2006 was watched by 6.1 million viewers.23
Early career
Lawson's early career consisted of writing book reviews,2425 after which time she went on to write a restaurant column for The Spectator in 1985.2627 She then became deputy literary editor of The Sunday Times in 1986, this being the place she met her future husband John Diamond.28 Lawson attracted unwanted publicity in 1989 when she publicly admitted voting for Labour in an election as opposed to her father's Conservative Party, and then criticized Thatcher in print.29 Regarding her political relationship with her father, Lawson has stated &quot;My father would never expect me to agree with him about anything in particular. And, to be honest, we never talk about politics much.&quot;30
After her stint at The Sunday Times, Lawson wrote for The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, The Evening Standard, The Observer, a food column for Vogue and a makeup column for The Times Magazine in the United Kingdom,31 and Gourmet and Bon Appetit in the United States.32 As well as her freelance writing career, she was a newspaper-reviewer on BBC1 Sunday-morning TV programme Breakfast with Frost. She also co-presented, with David Aaronovitch, the Channel 4 books discussion programme Booked in the 1990s, and was an occasional comp&lt;U+00E8&gt;re of BBC Two's press review What the Papers Say, as well as appearing on BBC radio. After just two weeks working on Talk Radio in 1995, Lawson was sacked after she had stated her shopping was done for her which was deemed incompatible with the radio station's desired &quot;common touch&quot;.33
Television
Following slots as a culinary sidekick on Nigel Slater's Real Food Show on Channel 4, she eventually went on to host her own television cookery series. Her interest in food was originally sparked after a visit to Paris as a teenager, after which time she looked upon food as source of enjoyment.34
Throughout Lawson's programmes, which are broadcast worldwide, she emphasises that she cooks for her own pleasure rather than to please others, and that she finds cooking therapeutic.35 She has become renowned for her flirtatious manner of presenting, but she has stated, &quot;It&lt;U+2019&gt;s not meant to be flirtatious. I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t have the talent to adopt a different persona. It's intimate, not flirtatious.&quot;36 Lawson is also infamous for her vivid and adjective-packed food descriptions in both her books and television programmes,37 as one critic wrote &quot;her descriptions of food can be a tangle of adjectives.&quot;38 She is not a trained chef nor does she like being referred to as a &quot;celebrity chef&quot;.39
2001—2004: Nigella Bites era
Lawson's first two books, How to Eat and How to be a Domestic Goddess, laid the foundation for her first ever cookery-based show, Nigella Bites, which ran from 2000 to 2001 on Channel4,4041 followed by a Christmas special in 2001.42 The first series of Nigella Bites averaged with 1.9 million viewers,43 and won her the title of Television Broadcast of the Year at the Guild of Food Writers Awards in 2001.44
The Nigella Bites series, which was filmed in her home in west London, was later bought by American television45 and broadcast on E!46 and Style Network.47 Lawson commented &quot;In the UK, my viewers have responded to the fact I'm trying to reduce, not add to, their burden and I'm looking forward to making that connection with Style viewers across the US.&quot;48 One newspaper in the U.S. suggested that Lawson was too sexy for their screens, but she was well received overall in America.49 One of the The New York Times' critics wrote &quot;Lawson's sexy roundness mixed with her speed-demon technique makes cooking dinner with Nigella look like a prelude to an orgy,&quot;5051 but another said &quot;It is the rare example of great food television.&quot;52 The series was followed by Forever Summer with Nigella in 2002, the concept being &quot;that you cook to make you still feel as though you're on holiday.&quot;53
Lawson appeared frequently on American television in 2004, doing cookery slots on The Ellen Degeneres Show where she cooked with Degeneres,54 and on KRON-TV's Morning Show in San Francisco.55
2005—2006: Nigella Feasts era
In the UK in 2005, Lawson hosted a daytime magazine TV programme on ITV1 called Nigella, on which celebrity guests joined her in a studio kitchen.56 The first episode debuted with 800,000 viewers.57 The chat-show was not well received by critics,58 and after losing 40% of its viewers in the first week, it was cancelled.59 Lawson later commented in an interview with Radio Times that on her first show, she was almost too frightened to come out of her dressing room.60 Lawson further stated that having to pretend to be interested in the lives of the celebrities on her show became too much of a chore; &quot;As long as no one makes me interview a celeb again, I&lt;U+2019&gt;ll be happy,&quot; she revealed.61 She also stated &quot;I now know I can't ever be a presenter, and won't do scripts.&quot;62
Her third food-based television series called Nigella Feasts, debuted on the USA's Food Network in Autumn 2006 for a 13-week run.63 Since the American broadcasting, Lawson signed a &lt;U+00A3&gt;2.5 million deal for the series to be shown in ten other countries across the world.64 She also began to write cooking articles for The New York Times,65 under the section of &quot;At My Table&quot;.66 With her career in the U.S becoming a success, she has appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, and twice on Late Show with David Letterman to date, where she did various cooking segments.67
Lawson was then signed to BBC Two to host a three-part cookery show entitled Nigella's Christmas Kitchen, which began on 6 December 2006. BBC Two's controller, Roly Keating, stated &quot;I'm absolutely delighted to welcome Nigella to BBC2.&quot;68 The first two episodes secured the second highest ratings for BBC Two overall, with the first episode debuting with a strong 3.50 million.6970 The third episode proceeded to become the top show on BBC Two the week that it was aired.71 Lawson's influential presence was also demonstrated, when after she had lauded goose fat as being an essential part of a Christmas roast on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross in late 2006, sales percentages of the fat increased significantly. Waitrose and Tesco both stated that goose fat sales had more than doubled, as well as Asda's goose fat sales increasing by 65%.72 Similarly after she advised using prunes in &quot;Christmas cakes and puddings&quot; on Nigella's Christmas Kitchen, Waitrose had increased sales of 30% year on year.7374
2007: Nigella Express era
A new 13-part series, entitled Nigella Express,75 began on BBC Two in Britain on 3 September 2007: &quot;a show packed with delicious ideas for good food fast&quot;,76 although Lawson admitted the recipes were not that healthy.77 The programme was filmed partly in her own kitchen, and suggested ways of making simple and quick dishes which are aimed at those with a busy lifestyle. After Lawson was seen shopping and making the food, she served the dishes to family and friends at her home.78
The show became another ratings success and one of BBC Two's top rated shows each week.79 The first episode debuted with 2.85 million,80 a high percentage above the channel's slot average.81 The second episode's viewing figures rose to 3.30 million,82 and the series peaked at 3.40 million on 22 October 2007.83 Her power to sway the public was again demonstrated when sales of Riesling wine increased by 30% in Britain after she used it in her Coq au Riesling recipe on her show,84 followed by similar circumstances with sales figures of the liqueur, advocaat.85 A statement from Waitrose read &quot;The Nigella Effect strikes again.&quot;86
The television series of Nigella Express was subject to criticism from The Daily Mail when it emerged that a bus Lawson was seen travelling on during the programme was hired and filled by extras.87 The producers responded by saying, &quot;This series is a factual entertainment cooking show, not an observational documentary and it is perfectly normal procedure.&quot;88 It was also revealed that the kitchens in which Lawson was seen cooking are in two separate locations; one in her home and the other in a television studio in Battersea, South London.89 Lawson herself also came under criticism when viewers complained that she had gained weight since the debut episode of the series.90 Critics criticised the series for containing what they described as &quot;scenes of gluttony not seen since the golden age of the Cookie Monster.&quot;91
The rights to the series have since been sold to the Food Network in America,92 and to Discovery Asia.93
Merchandise
Lawson has written six bestselling cookery books in total. She originally came up with the idea of writing a cookery book after attending a dinner party and observing her host in tears due to an unset cr&lt;U+00E8&gt;me caramel, prompting Lawson to realise that cooking should not be a stressful time.94 She then wrote How to Eat which was published in 1998,95 and included culinary tips on preparation and saving time.96 She further commented &quot;It&lt;U+2019&gt;s true that I wouldn&lt;U+2019&gt;t have written the first book had my sister and mother been alive. It was my way of continuing our conversation. It&lt;U+2019&gt;s also this Jewish thing of naming and remembering people, and I think there is a sense of keeping that side of life going.&quot;97 The book became very successful and sold 300,000 copies in the UK.98
She soon had a second best-selling book in 2000, How to be a Domestic Goddess, and a social affairs column in The Observer.99 Lawson rejected feminist criticism of her book,100 and stated &quot;Some people did take the domestic goddess title literally rather than ironically. It was about the pleasures of feeling like one rather than actually being one.&quot;101 The book sold 180,000 copies in 4 months,102 and won Lawson the title of Author of The Year at the British Book Awards in 2001,103 fending off competition from J. K. Rowling.104 One commentator suggested she only won the award because her husband was about to die of cancer.105 Lawson retorted &quot;I am not against pity, but I have no desire to be tragic.&quot;106 Both How to Eat and How to be a Domestic Goddess were both published in America in 2000 and 2001.107
In 2001 and 2002, the two series of Nigella Bites and Forever Summer both yielded accompanying recipe books,108 including the number one bestseller, Nigella Bites,109 of which Waterstone's book stores reported sales of 300,000.110 Lawson's fifth book, Feast Food That Celebrates Life, which was released in 2004,111 made sales worth a reputed &lt;U+00A3&gt;3 million.112 
The accompanying book to Lawson's 2007 series, Nigella Express, was released in the UK in September 2007 and later in America in November.113 Nigella Express, sharing the same name as the BBC series, soon became another bestseller in Britain,114 and was outselling another popular television chef, Jamie Oliver, by 100,000 copies according to Waterstone's.115 It was reported that over 490,000 copies had been sold by mid-December.116 Furthermore, the book was number one for a period on Amazon UK's bestselling books,117 and was ninth on their overall list of Christmas bestsellers in any category.118 In a study conducted in 2007 on the readability of different recipes, the chatty and florid style of Lawson's recipes was judged to be confusing to readers with weak reading skills.119 She is now estimated to have sold more than 3 million books worldwide.120121
The current First Lady of the United States, Laura Bush, is said to be a fan of Lawson's recipes. She once included one of Lawson's soups as the starter for the 2002 presidential Christmas dinner.122 In 2003 Lawson oversaw the menu and preparations for a lunch hosted by Tony Blair at Downing Street for George W. Bush and Laura Bush during a state visit to the UK. The menu included roast pumpkin, feta and radicchio as starters, Norfolk ham with a honey and mustard glaze and apple pie.123
As well as her television shows and books, Lawson has a profitable line of kitchenware, called the &quot;Living Kitchen&quot; range, which is sold by numerous retailers and is available in cream and duck egg blue.124 Her range's value has continued to grow, going from an estimated &lt;U+00A3&gt;2 million125 to a reputed &lt;U+00A3&gt;7 million a year as of 2007.126 Lawson is also considering releasing her own food range.127
Personal life
Lawson met journalist John Diamond in 1986, when they were both writing for The Sunday Times.128 Three years later, they were married in Venice.129 They had two children together, Cosima and Bruno.130 Lawson, whose mother and sister died of cancer, lost her husband John Diamond to throat cancer in March 2001 after he had been diagnosed in 1997.131 One of Diamond's last messages to Lawson was &quot;How proud I am of you and what you have become. The great thing about us is that we have made us who we are.&quot;132 His death occurred during the filming of Nigella Bites; &quot;I took a fortnight off. But I'm not a great believer in breaks,&quot; commented Lawson,133 but she did suffer a bout of depression.134 After his death, Lawson kept all of the press clippings in what she called her &quot;Morbidobox&quot;.135 During his illness, Diamond chronicled and documented his life with cancer in a newspaper column, documentary and book.136
Lawson later married art-collector ad man Charles Saatchi in September 2003,137 and came under criticism when it was suggested she had started her relationship with him before the death of Diamond.138 They currently live in a &lt;U+00A3&gt;7 million home in Eaton Square in London's exclusive Belgravia district.139 Saatchi is worth a reputed &lt;U+00A3&gt;70 million,140 while Lawson herself is worth &lt;U+00A3&gt;15 million as of 2007, &lt;U+00A3&gt;8 million of which comes from book sales.141 It began circulating in the media in early 2008 that Lawson was quoted as saying that her two children should inherit none of the fortune, apparently having said &quot;I am determined that my children should have no financial security. It ruins people not having to earn money.&quot;142 She strongly denied these plans in a statement on her personal website, which read &quot;Of course I have no intention of leaving my children destitute and starving - rather, this is a story that came from a comment I made about my belief that you have to work in order to learn the value of money.&quot;143 She also said &quot;although I'd normally ignore it, I want to set the record, not least to spare my children continuing embarrassment.&quot;144
It was revealed by leaked documents that Lawson has declined an OBE.145146 Lawson was once named as one of the world's most beautiful women.147 One critic referred to her as &quot;stunningly beautiful, warm, honest, likeable and amazingly normal&quot;.148
In her newspaper articles she has shown a liberal attitude to sexuality (&quot;most [women] simply have, somewhere, a fantasy about having sex, in a non-defining, non-exclusive way, with other women&quot;).149 She has said that she loves watching football and is a supporter of Chelsea football club.150
Popular culture
Her style of presentation is often gently mocked by comedians and commentators, particularly in a regularly-occurring impersonation of her in the BBC television comedy series Dead Ringers, who perceive that she plays overtly upon her attractiveness and sexuality as a device to engage viewers of her cookery programmes, despite Lawson's repeated denials that she does so.151
She has also been featured on BBC One TV impersonation-sketch show Big Impression, where Ronni Ancona has done impressions of her, which mock and embellish the fact that she uses slightly exotic foods. For example, in one sketch, a recipe requires phoenix eggs. In her act, Ancona also lampooned Lawson's tendency to present her recipes with over-description. Lawson's view on Ancona's impressions is &quot;very odd but very flattering at the same time.&quot;152
