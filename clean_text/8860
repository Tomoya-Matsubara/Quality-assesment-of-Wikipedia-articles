Daphne Mayo MBE (1895-1982) is a significant 20th century Australian artist, most prominently known for her work in sculpture, particularly the tympanum of Brisbane City Hall.
Early life
Born in Sydney in 1895, she was educated in Brisbane, and received a Diploma in Art Craftsmanship from the Brisbane Central Technical College in 1913. At the college she was strongly influenced by L.J Harvey who initiated her interest in modelling.1 She further developed her skills in this medium when she was presented with an opportunity to go to London in 1919.2 There she took a position as an assistant sculptor before her acceptance into the Sculpture School of the Royal Academy.3
Prominent Works
Despite her small frame, she produced many physically demanding works that were carved in situ.4 On her return to Brisbane in 1925, Daphne created a number of local works including:

The Brisbane City Hall Tympanum (1927-30). The tympanum represents a relief of early settlement entitled The progress of civilisation in the State of Queensland. This sculpture has been considered one of the most important Brisbane sculpture commissions ever awarded.

The Queensland Women's War Memorial (1929-32) located in Brisbane's Anzac Square is a sandstone relief of a military procession. The first war memorial depicting servicewomen, this piece is also important for highlighting the important contribution made by women to the tradition of war memorials.5
A statue of Major General Sir William Glasgow (1961-64).6

Public Service
She lobbied successfully on numerous occasions for funding for the fledgling Queensland Art Gallery, established with painter colleague Vida Lahey an Art Reference Library at the University of Queensland in 1936, was a trustee of the Queensland Art Gallery (1960-67), and left her private papers to The University of Queensland's Fryer Library.7
For campaigning vigorously for the arts in Queensland during this time she was awarded the Society of Artists' medal in 1938 and MBE in 1959.8
Legacy
The Daphne Mayo Visiting Professorship in Visual Culture The School of English, Media Studies and Art History at The University of Queensland established the annual Daphne Mayo Visiting Professorship in Visual Culture, featuring each year, a major world figure to visit Brisbane to speak about the latest trends, influences, and theories in their area of visual culture, and to give public lectures and take master classes with postgraduate students at The University of Queensland.
The Annual Daphne Mayo Lecture, also named in her honour, is presented by the University Art Museum and The School of English, Media Studies and Art History, in association with The Alumni Association of The University of Queensland Inc. and is dedicated to a leading Australian advocate of the visual arts.9 There is also an artists society named after her, the Friends of Daphne Mayo.
