The Calgary Flames are a professional men's ice hockey team based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  They are members of the Northwest Division NHL Northwest Division of the Western Conference NHL Western Conference of the National Hockey League NHL. The club is the third major-professional ice hockey team to represent the city of Calgary, following the Calgary Tigers 192126 and Calgary Cowboys 197577.

The Flames arrived in the city of Calgary in 1980 after spending their first eight seasons in Atlanta, Georgia Atlanta, Georgia U.S. state Georgia, as the Atlanta Flames. The Flames spent their first three seasons playing in the Stampede Corral before moving into their current home arena, the Pengrowth Saddledome Olympic Saddledome now Pengrowth Saddledome, in 1983-84 Calgary Flames season 1983. In 1985-86 Calgary Flames season 1986, the Flames became the first Calgary team since the Tigers in 1923-24 WCHL season 1924 to compete for the Stanley Cup.  In 1988-89 Calgary Flames season 1989, the Flames captured the Cup for the first time. 

Calgary is one of two NHL franchises in Alberta, with the other being the Edmonton Oilers. The cities' proximity has led to a famous rivalry, known as the Battle of Alberta. Games between the teams are often heated events.cite news  first=Eric  last=Francis  title=The uncivil war...Edmonton...April 23, 1988...Oilers 4 Flames 2  url=http://www.slam.ca/Slam030917/col_francis-sun.html  publisher=Calgary Sun  date=2003-09-17  accessdate=2006-11-28 cite news  first=Eric  last=Francis  author=  title=The uncivil war...Calgary...January 20, 2003...Flames 3 Oilers 2  url=http://fun.canoe.ca/Slam030921/col_francis-sun.html  publisher=Calgary Sun  date=2003-09-21  accessdate=2006-11-28

main Atlanta Flames

The Flames were the result of the NHL's first pre-emptive strike against the upstart World Hockey Association.cite book  last=Boer  first=Peter  title=The Calgary Flames  year=2006  pages=12  publisher=Overtime Books  isbn=1-897277-07-5   In December 1971-72 NHL season 1971, the NHL hastily granted a team to Long Island&mdash;the New York Islanders&mdash;to keep the WHA's New York Raiders out of the brand new Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum.  This came less than a year after the Vancouver Canucks and Buffalo Sabres joined the league.  Needing another team to balance the schedule, the NHL awarded a team to an Atlanta, Georgia Atlanta-based group that owned the National Basketball Association's Atlanta Hawks, headed by prominent local real estate developer Tom Cousins.cite web url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/nyi/nylsanders.html title=History of the New York Islanders work=Sports E-Cyclopedia publisher=Tank Productions accessdate=2006-11-27 Cousins named the team the Flames after the fire resulting from the Sherman's March to the Sea March to the Sea in the American Civil War by General William Tecumseh Sherman, in which Atlanta was nearly destroyed.  They played home games in the Omni Coliseum in downtown Atlanta.cite web url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/atlflames/aflames.html title=History of the Atlanta Flames work=Sports E-Cyclopedia publisher=Tank Productions accessdate=2006-11-27

The Flames were relatively successful early on.  Under head coaches Bernie Geoffrion Bernie Boom Boom Geoffrion, Fred Creighton and Al MacNeil, the Flames made the playoffs in six of eight seasons in Atlanta.cite web url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/teamseasons.php?tid=235 title=Atlanta Flames seasons work=The Internet Hockey Database accessdate=2008-01-03 In marked contrast, their expansion cousins, the Islanders, won only 31 games during their first two years in the league combined.cite web url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/teamseasons.php?tid=52 title=New York Islanders seasons work=The Internet Hockey Database accessdate=2008-01-03  This relative success would not translate in the playoffs, however, as the Flames won only two post-season games during their time in Atlanta.cite book  title=200607 Calgary Flames Media Guide  publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club  pages=pg. 219  editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean
  

Despite the on-ice success, the Atlanta ownership was never on sound financial footing.  Fletcher said years later that Cousins' initial financial projections for an NHL team did not account for the WHA entering the picture.cite web  url=http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/halloffame/fletcher110304.html  title=Building a franchise is Flether's forte  accessdate=2006-11-28  last=McGourty  first=John  date=2004-11-03  publisher=nhl.comcite book  last=Duhatschek  first=Eric et al.  authorlink=  coauthors=  title=Hockey Chronicles  year=2001  publisher=Checkmark Books  location=New York City  isbn=0816046972  They also didn't draw very well, and were never able to get a major television contract.  The Flames' early success resulted in them NHL Entry Draft drafting in the latter part of the first round, resulting in them being saddled with journeymen players while the Islanders built a dynasty.  

In 1980, Cousins was in considerable financial difficulty and was forced to sell the Flames to stave off bankruptcy. With few serious offers from local groups, he was very receptive to an offer from a group of Calgary businessmen fronted by Canadian entrepreneur and former Oilers owner Nelson Skalbania  and including former Canadian Football League star and current Lieutenant Governor of Alberta Normie Kwong.http://flames.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NHLPage&bcid=his_team_history Eventually, Cousins agreed to sell the team to the Calgary group for United States dollar US$16 million--at the time, a record sale price for an NHL team.  A last-ditch effort to keep the team in Atlanta fell short, and the sale to Skalbania's group closed on May 21.  That day, Skalbania announced that the team would move to Calgary. He decided to retain the Flames name, feeling it would be a good fit for an oil town like Calgary. The team's flaming A logo was replaced by a flaming C.cite book  title=The Name Game: Football, Baseball, Hockey & Basketball How Your Favorite Sports Teams Were Named  last=Donovan  first=Michael Leo  authorlink=  coauthors=  year=1997  publisher=Warwick Publishing  location=Toronto  isbn=1895629748  pages= Skalbania sold his interest in 1981, and the Flames have been locally owned since.cite web url=http://www.oilersheritage.com/legacy/contributions_owners_nelsonskalbania2.html title=Nelson Skalbania work=Edmonton Oilers Heritage accessdate=2007-06-18

Unlike the WHA's Calgary Cowboys, who folded three years previous, the Flames were immediately embraced by the city of Calgary.  While the Cowboys could manage to sell only 2,000 season tickets in their final campaign of 1976-77 WHA season 197677, the Flames sold 10,000 full- and half-season ticket packages in the 7,000 seat Stampede Corral.cite book  last=Zeman  first=Gary  title=Alberta on Ice  year=1986  publisher=Heritage House  pages=94  isbn=0969232004


Led by Kent Nilsson's 49-goal, 131-point season, the Flames qualified for the playoffs in their first season in Calgary with a 39274 record, good for third in the Patrick Division.cite book  title=200708 Calgary Flames Media Guide  publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club  pages=pg. 105  editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean The team found much greater playoff success in Calgary than it did in Atlanta, winning their first two playoff series over the Chicago Blackhawks Chicago Black Hawks and Philadelphia Flyers before bowing out to the Minnesota North Stars in the semi-finals.cite book  title=200607 Calgary Flames Media Guide  publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club  pages=pg. 131  editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean  This early success was not soon repeated. After a losing record in 1981-82 NHL season 198182, General Manager Cliff Fletcher jettisoned several former Atlanta players who couldn't adjust to the higher-pressure hockey environment and rebuilt the roster.cite book  last=Boer  first=Peter  title=The Calgary Flames  year=2006  pages=51  publisher=Overtime Books  isbn=1-897277-07-5  Over the next three seasons, he put together a core of players that would remain together through the early 1990s.

Fletcher's efforts to match the Oilers led him to draw talent from areas previously neglected by the NHL. The Flames were among the earliest teams to sign large numbers of U.S. college players, including Joel Otto, Gary Suter, and Colin Patterson.cite web url=http://couchpotatohockey.com/Teams/Team%20Biographies/Calgary.asp title=Calgary Flames Team Biography publisher=Couchpotatohockey  accessdate=2007-12-07 Fletcher also stepped up the search for European hockey talent, acquiring Hakan Loob and other key players. He was among the first to NHL Entry Draft draft players from the Soviet Union, including HC CSKA Moscow star Sergei Makarov in 1983 NHL Entry Draft 1983, but Soviet players were not released to Western teams until 1989.cite web  url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/news/2002/09/27/soviet_legacy/  title=Sweeping changes  author=Dolezar, John A.  date=2002-09-27  accessdate=2007-12-07  publisher=Sports Illustrated  Still, the team was sufficiently improved to challenge the Oilers, who required the maximum seven games to defeat the Flames en route to their 1983-84 NHL season 1984 Stanley Cup Championship.cite book  title=200708 Calgary Flames Media Guide  publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club  pages=pg. 232  editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean

In 1983, the Flames moved into their new home, the Olympic Saddledome now known as the Pengrowth Saddledome.  Located on the grounds of the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede, the Saddledome was built as a host venue for the 1988 Winter Olympics.  In three seasons in the Corral, the Flames lost only 32 home games.cite book  title=200607 Calgary Flames Media Guide  publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club  editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean  pages=pg. 4  In 1985, the Flames hosted the 37th NHL All-Star Game, a 64 victory by the Wales Conference.cite web  url=http://www.detroithockey.net/nhl/allstar.php  title=NHL All-Star Games  accessdate=2008-01-03  publisher=detroithockey.net

The players acquired by Fletcher matured into one of the strongest teams in the league during the mid-1980s and early 1990s. From 1984-85 NHL season 1984-85 to 1990-91 NHL season 1990-91, the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one.  cite web  url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/teamseasons.php?tid=43  title=Calgary Flames seasons  accessdate=2008-01-03  publisher=The Internet Hockey Database  However, they were usually unable to transfer that success into a deep playoff run.  This was largely because they were unable to get the better of their provincial rivals, the powerhouse Oilers.  The NHL's playoff structure of the time made it very likely that the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in the conference finals.  From 1983 until 1990, either the Oilers or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals.cite web  url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=johnson_george&id=2191048  title=Bile back in Battle of Alberta  accessdate=2008-01-03  date=2005-10-17  publisher=ESPN  author=Johnson, George  

By 1985-86 NHL season 1986 the Flames had landed forwards Doug Risebrough, Lanny McDonald, and Dan Quinn, defenceman Al MacInnis, and goaltender Mike Vernon ice hockey Mike Vernon.  Finishing second in the Smythe with a 40316 record the only season from 1984 to 1991 that they didn't finish with 90 or more points, the Flames swept the Winnipeg Jets in the first round of the playoffs, setting up a matchup with the Oilers.  Edmonton finished 30 points ahead of Calgary during the season, and was heavily favoured to win a third Cup in a row.  However, the Flames upset the heavily favoured Oilers in seven games.  The series winning goal came at the hands of Oilers' rookie James Stephen Smith Steve Smith as he accidentally shot the puck off of goaltender Grant Fuhr's leg and into his own net.cite web  url=http://www.oilersheritage.com/history/dynasty_players_stevesmith.html   title=Dynasty Players: Steve Smith  accessdate=2007-12-07  publisher=Edmonton Oilers Heritage The goal remains one of the most legendary blunders in hockey history.cite web  url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/features/si_stanley_cup/1986/  title=SI Flashback: Stanley Cup 1986  author=Swift, E.M. accessdate=2007-12-07  publisher=Sports Illustratedcite web  url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/stanleycup2006/content/features/topgame7.html  title=Top 10: Game 7's  accessdate=2007-12-07  publisher=CBC Sportscite web  url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/chokes/hockey.html  title=Biggest Stanley Cup playoff chokes  accessdate=2007-12-07  publisher=ESPN

From there, the Flames went on to defeat the St. Louis Blues hockey St. Louis Blues in another seven game series.  This time, Calgary had to survive a scare of its own, shaking off the The Monday Night Miracle ice hockey Monday Night Miracle at the St. Louis Arena.  Doug Wickenheiser scored in overtime to cap off a comeback from 52 down with 10 minutes to play in the third period in game six, forcing the Flames to a seventh game.cite web  url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/special/pd125.nsf/0/8562839B99EBB29186256E0700728192?OpenDocument  title=Birth of the Blues  author=Goold, Derrick  date=2004-01-20  accessdate=2007-12-07  publisher=St. Louis Post Dispatch  Calgary would win game seven at home, 21, advancing into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time.  In the finals, the Flames proved to be no match for the Montreal Canadiens, losing in five games.  Montreal rookie goaltender Patrick Roy was nearly unstoppable in the last two games, allowing only four goals en route to winning the Conn Smythe Trophy.  

The Flames followed up their run to the finals with their best regular seasons in team history.  Calgary's 46313 record in 1986-87 NHL season 198687 was good for third overall in the NHL.cite book  title=200607 Calgary Flames Media Guide  publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club  editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean  pages=pg. 125 Calgary was unable to duplicate its playoff success, however, losing its first round match-up with the Jets in six games.  The season was also difficult off the ice, as 1986 NHL Entry Draft 1986 first round draft pick George Pelawa was killed in a car accident prior to the season's start.cite web  url=http://www.canoe.ca/Slam031008/col_ulmer-sun.html  title=Heat is on  author=Ulmer, Mike  date=2003-10-08  accessdate=2007-12-07  publisher=Toronto Sun  

The Flames recorded their first 100-point season in 1987-88 NHL season 198788, earning the Presidents' Trophy for having the league's best record, ending the Oilers' six-year reign atop the Smythe Division in the process.cite book  title=200607 Calgary Flames Media Guide  publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club  editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean  pages=pg. 124 However, they were swept by the Oilers in the second round of the playoffs.  Joe Nieuwendyk became the second rookie in league history to score 50+ goals, earning the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year.cite web  url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=11194  title=Joe Nieuwendyk player profile  accessdate=2007-12-07  publisher=legendsofhockey.net  work=Hockey Hall of Fame  Looking to bolster the line-up for a playoff run, the Flames dealt young sniper Brett Hull, along with Steve Bozek, to the Blues for Rob Ramage and Rick Wamsley on March 7, 1988.cite web url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/news/2001/08/08/sayitaintso_flames/  title=Say it aint so: Calgary Flames  publisher=Sports Illustrated  author=Dolezar, John A  date=2001-08-08  accessdate=2007-05-14  The Flames playoff frustration would continue, however. After defeating the Los Angeles Kings in five games, Calgary was swept out of the playoffs in four straight by the Oilers.

In 1988-89 NHL season 198889, the Flames continued to improve.  They captured their second consecutive Presidents' Trophy with a franchise record 117 points, finishing 26 points better than the second-place Kings in the Smythe Division.cite book  title=200607 Calgary Flames Media Guide  publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club  editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean  pages=pg. 123  Fletcher continued to tinker with the roster, acquiring Doug Gilmour as part of a six player deal at the trade deadline. In the playoffs, the Flames were stretched to seven games in the first round by the Canucks, relying on several saves by goaltender Mike Vernon ice hockey Mike Vernon, including a famous glove save off a Stan Smyl breakaway in overtime.  The save remains a defining moment in Flames history.cite web  url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam040416/nhl_calvan8-sun.html  title=Smyl doesn't lose sleep over big save  author=Sportak, Randy  date=2004-04-16  accessdate=2007-12-07  publisher=Calgary Sun  

The Flames then made short work of the Kings, defeating them in four straight, before eliminating the Chicago Blackhawks in five games to set up a rematch of the 1986 Stanley Cup Finals against Montreal.  This time, the Flames won in six games, the last being a 42 victory in Montreal. The clinching win was especially significant in that it marked the only time that an opposing team defeated the Canadiens to win the Stanley Cup on Montreal Forum ice.cite web  last=McGourty  first=John  url=http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/history/cup/mcdonald052301.html  title=Lanny, Stanley into the sunset  date=2001-05-23  publisher=NHL.com  accessdate=2007-12-07 Al MacInnis captured the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoffs most valuable player,cite web url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/ind07MacInnis.htm  title=Al MacInnis  publisher=legendsofhockey.net  work=Hockey Hall of Fame  accessdate=2000-01-04 while long-time captain Lanny McDonald announced his retirement.

In 1989, thanks in part to Cliff Fletcher's diplomatic efforts, the Soviets finally gave permission for a select group of Soviet hockey players to sign with NHL teams. The first of these players was Sergei Pryakhin. Although Pryakhin never became an NHL regular, his arrival blazed a trail for the large number of Russian players who entered the NHL beginning in 1989-90 NHL season 198990. Sergei Makarov joined the Flames that season and, though already in his thirties, became the fifth Flame to win the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's Rookie of the Year. The selection would prove controversial, prompting the league to amend the rules to exclude any player over the age of 26 from future consideration.cite web url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DA103EF933A15755C0A966958260  title=New Rules for Rookies  date=1990-06-20  publisher=New York Times  accessdate=2007-06-10

In 1991, Fletcher left the Flames to become the general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs.  He had been the team's general manager since its inception in 1972.cite web url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/spot_oneononeb200401.htm  title=One on One with Cliff Fletcher  publisher=legendsofhockey.net  work=Hockey Hall of Fame  accessdate=2007-05-14  He was succeeded in Calgary by Doug Risebrough, and the two quickly completed a ten player mega-trade that saw disgruntled forward Doug Gilmour dealt to Toronto with four other players for former 50 goal scorer Gary Leeman and four others.  The trade transformed both clubs.  The formerly inept Leafs turned into a contender almost immediately, while Leeman scored only nine goals in a Flames uniform.cite web url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2003/03/13/leafs_flames030313.html  title=Gilmour begins again with Leafs in Calgary  publisher=CBC Sports  date=2003-04-13  accessdate=2007-05-14  Despite the blossoming of Theoren Fleury into an NHL star, the Flames missed the playoffs entirely in 1991-92 NHL season 1992, only a year after finishing with their third 100-point season in franchise history.  It was the first time the Flames had missed the playoffs since 1974-75 NHL season 1975, when they were still in Atlanta.  It was also only the third time out of the playoffs in the franchise's 20-year history.

Image:JaromeIginla.jpg left thumb 150px Jarome Iginla was one of the team's few bright spots during its seven year playoff drought
Calgary rebounded to make the playoffs for the next three seasons, including two consecutive division titles. However, they failed move past the first round of the playoffs each time.  In 1996-97 NHL season 1997, only two years after winning their second consecutive division title, the Flames missed the playoffs and would not return for seven years.  The low point came in the 1997-98 NHL season 1997-98 season, in which the Flames finished with only 67 points--the second-lowest point total in franchise historyhttp://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/calgary/calflames.html and just two points ahead of the 1972-73 Atlanta Flames

During this time, the Flames found it increasingly difficult to hold onto their best players, as salaries escalated while the Canadian Dollar lost value against the United States American Dollar.cite web url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/cup/2004-05-25-flames-cover_x.htm   title=Flames: Bright spot for Canada  publisher=USA Today  author=Gardiner, Andy  date=2004-05-25  accessdate=2007-12-07  The NHL's small-market Canadian teams found it increasingly difficult to compete in the new environment.cite web url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=cox_damien&id=3098820  title=What is Ottawa's success worth to Canadians, NHL? A lot  publisher=EPSN  author=Cox, Damien  date=2007-11-07  accessdate=2007-12-06  In 1998-99 NHL season 1999, for example, the Flames traded Fleury--the team's all-time leading scorer--to the Colorado Avalanche midway through the season.

As the Flames sagged in the standings, their attendance also sagged.  For most of their first 16 years in Calgary, Flames tickets were among the toughest in the NHL.  However, by 1999, attendance had fallen off so severely that the owners issued an ultimatum--buy more season tickets or the team would join its departed counterparts in Winnipeg and Quebec Nordiques Quebec City in leaving for the United States.  The fans responded by buying enough season tickets to keep the Flames in Calgary for the 2000-01 NHL season 2000-01 season.  However, the Flames were forced to issue another appeal for more season tickets in the summer of 2000. cite web url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2000/05/18/flames00518.html  title=Flames aim to save team by end of June  publisher=CBC Sports  date=2000-05-18  accessdate=2007-12-06  The campaign, aimed at increasing season ticket sales from a franchise low of 8,700 to 14,000, proved successful.cite web url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2000/06/29/flames000629.html  title=Flames reach season ticket goal  publisher=CBC Sports  date=2000-11-10  accessdate=2007-12-06  The increased sales did not halt the Flames' financial losses, however, as the team estimated it lost $14.5 million between 2001 and 2003.

One of the few bright spots in this stretch was Jarome Iginla. Iginla, who made his NHL debut in the Flames last playoff games in 1996, captured the Rocket Richard Trophy Rocket Richard and Art Ross Trophy Art Ross Trophies in 2001-02 Calgary Flames season 200102 as NHL goal- and point-scoring champion after scoring 52 goals and 96 points.

2004present
After seven consecutive seasons of not making the playoffs, the Flames finally returned to the post-season in 2004.  The Flames became the first team in NHL history to defeat three division championscite web  url=http://www.nhl.com/columns/kreiser/flames050704.html  title=Flames scorch foes,

Flames' first victim was the Northwest Division champion Vancouver Canucks, whom they defeated in seven games.

The Flames then upset the Detroit Red Wings, who had garnered the league's best record, in six games. After eliminating the Pacific Division champs, the San Jose Sharks, in six games in the Western Conference Final, the Flames earned a trip to the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals to face the Tampa Bay Lightning. The Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C., flew the Flames flag beside the Flag of Canada Maple Leaf,cite web  url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_hwang/20040528.html  title=Cheering for the home team  accessdate=2006-11-28  date=2004-05-28  last=Hwang  first=Rosa  publisher=CBC Sports  while Prime Minister of Canada Prime Minister Paul Martin dubbed the Flames Canada's team.cite web  url=http://calgary-flames-news.newslib.com/story/981-245220/  title=Martin dubs Calgary Flames 'Canada's Team'  accessdate=2006-12-23  date=2004-05-30  publisher=CTV Sports

The final series went to seven games, with the Flames suffering a controversial non-goal in game six at home.  Replays showed that Martin Gelinas came close to scoring what would have been the go-ahead goal late in the third period; however, the referees never signaled a goal, and later replays were ruled inconclusive.  The Lightning would go on to win the game in overtime hockey double overtime,cite news  first=Damian  last=Cristodero  title= One last shot  url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/06/06/Lightning/One_last_shot.shtml  publisher=St. Petersberg Times  date=2004-06-06  accessdate=2006-11-28 before winning game seven at home to capture the Stanley Cup.

The Flames would not raise their Western Conference championship banner for nearly 15 months, as the 2004-05 NHL season 200405 season was wiped out by a 2004-05 NHL lockout labour dispute.  During the lockout, team owner and Chairman of the Board, Harley Hotchkiss, attempted to save the season by engaging in discussions with National Hockey League Players Association president Trevor Linden.cite news  first=Ira  last=Podel  title=Linden, Hotchkiss to meet again  url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/2005-01-19-lockout-meeting_x.htm  publisher=USA Today  date=2005-01-19  accessdate=2008-01-04  While their discussions failed to save the season, Hotchkiss was credited with easing tensions that allowed for a successful negotiation of a new collective bargaining agreement.cite news  first=Morris  last=Dalla Costa  title=Hotchkiss happy where NHL is now  url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Calgary/2007/09/21/4514738-sun.html  publisher=Calgary Sun  date=2007-09-21  accessdate=2008-01-04

The Flames played their 25th season in Calgary in 2005-06 NHL season 200506, finishing with 103 points. It was their best total since the 1989 Cup winning season, and good enough to capture their first division title in 12 years. However, the Flames lost to the Anaheim Ducks Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in seven games during the first round of the playoffs. Miikka Kiprusoff captured both the William M. Jennings Trophy and the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's top goaltender, while defenceman Dion Phaneuf set a franchise record for goals by a rookie blue-liner with 20.cite web  url=http://www.nhl.com/news/2006/05/271296.html  title=NHL announces 200506 trophy finalists  accessdate=2007-12-23  date=2006-06-24  publisher=NHL.com

The 2006 off-season began with a trade for Alex Tanguay, formerly of the Colorado Avalanche,cite web  url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/draft2006/news/story?id=2499645  title=Avs send Tanguay to Flames for Leopold, picks  accessdate=2006-11-28  date=2006-05-04  publisher=nhl.com and with Darryl Sutter relinquishing his head coaching position to assistant Jim Playfair so he could focus on his duties as general manager.cite web  url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=171090&hubname=nhl  title=Sutter steps down as Flames coach  accessdate=2006-11-28  publisher=TSN Despite a marked improvement in team offence and a solid 96-point season, the Flames were pushed into eighth place in the Western Conference, largely because seven teams in the West finished with over 100 points. In the playoffs, Calgary fell in six games to the top seeded Detroit Red Wings in the first round.  In game five, several Flames drew penalties for illegal stickwork during a 5-1 rout.http://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20062007/GS030155.HTM Notably, backup goaltender Jamie McLennan slashed Red Wings forward Johan Franzen in the stomach only 18 seconds after relieving Kiprusoff and was ejected.  Playfair and the Flames organization were also heavily fined because the NHL placed a particular point of emphasis on penalties that occur when the game is out of hand.cite web  url=http://www.globesports.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070422.wmclennan0422/GSStory/GlobeSportsHockey/home  title=Five-game suspension for McLennan  author=Duhatschek, Eric  date=2007-04-22  accessdate=2007-12-07  publisher=The Globe and Mail

Prior to the start of the 2007-08 NHL season 200708 season, the Flames demoted Playfair to associate coach, bringing in Mike Keenan as the team's third head coach in three years.cite web  url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=210816&hubname=  title=Flames name Keenan new head coach  date=2007-06-14  accessdate=2007-12-07  publisher=TSN  During the season, Jarome Iginla became the Flames' all-time leader in games played, passing Al MacInnis' mark of 803.cite web  url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/news?slug=txflamesiginla&prov=st&type=lgns  title=Iginla sets franchise games record  date=2007-11-30  accessdate=2007-12-07  publisher=Yahoo!

Through the team's non-profit charity, the Flames Foundation, the team has donated over $29 million to causes throughout southern Alberta.cite web  url=http://flames.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NHLPage&bcid=com_ffcr  title=Community  accessdate=2007-12-07  publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club  Along with the Rotary International Rotary Club, the Flames are helping to fund the first children's hospice in Alberta, and one of only six in North America.cite web  url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2007/05/09/hospice-alberta.html  title=Alberta to get first children's hospice  date=2007-05-09  accessdate=2007-12-07  publisher=CBC

The Flames are also close partners with the Alberta Children's Hospital.  Among the many activities the Flames participate in, the Wheelchair Hockey Challenge with the Townsend Tigers has remained a highly popular tradition for both the players and the children involved.  In 2007, the Tigers defeated the Flames 109, to move to a perfect 260 record since the challenge was first instituted in 1981.cite web  url=http://flames.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=344100  title=Townsend Tigers extend winning streak to 26  date=2007-11-21  accessdate=2007-12-07  publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club

Red Mile

During the Flames' run to the Stanley Cup Finals of 2004, the city of Calgary essentially became the host of a non-stop party. The 17th Avenue SW entertainment district, which runs west from the Pengrowth Saddledome, saw as many as 35,000 fans pack the streets during the first three rounds of the playoffs, and over 60,000 in the finals.cite web url=http://calgary.ctv.ca/servlet/RTGAMArticleHTMLTemplate/A/20040604/flameswingame5?brand=generic&hub=&tf=CFCNPlus/generic/hubs/frontpage.html&cf=CFCNPlus/generic/hubs/frontpage.cfg&slug=flameswingame5&date=20040604&archive=CFCNPlus&ad_page_name=&nav=home&subnav=fullstory  title=Police brace for another big night on the Red Mile publisher=CTV Sports  date=2004-06-04 accessdate=2007-12-06 The Red Mile party received widespread coverage in newspapers across North America,cite web  last=James  first=Brant  url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/05/20/Sports/Flames_reach_Stanley_.shtml  title=Flames reach Stanley Cup final  publisher=St. Petersberg Times  date=2004-05-20  accessdate=2007-12-07 as the parties remained peaceful and incidents were minimal despite the large number of people in a small area.cite web last=Rodriguez first=Jose url=http://calsun.canoe.ca/News/Columnists/Rodriguez_Jose/2006/04/14/1534061.html  title=Red Mile reality check publisher=Calgary Sun date=2006-04-14 accessdate=2007-12-07

In April 2006, the Calgary Police Service announced that Red Mile gatherings would not be encouraged, and that measures would be taken to discourage them, including traffic diversions, a zero-tolerance policy on noise and rowdy behaviour, and the presence of plain-clothed officers among the crowd to ticket offenders.cite web last=Seskus first=Tony coauthors=Sean Myers url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/story.html?id=3ff860fa-18ea-4297-b0f2-f509d7021af9&k=59310  title=The party's over for the Red Mile publisher=Calgary Herald date=2006-04-11 accessdate=2007-12-07 After meeting with the Chief of Police, Mayor Dave Bronconnier convinced the Calgary Police Service to relax their ban on the Red Mile and encouraged people to make their way to 17th Ave, however the police retained their zero-tolerance policy on public nudity and drunkenness.

The C of Red
During the Flames' run to the Stanley Cup Finals of 2004, most of the Flames fans attending the hockey games at the Saddledome wore a red jersey with Calgary's flaming C on it. Sales of the Flames red home jersey, introduced at the start of the 200304 campaign, were so strong during the playoffs that the team set a league record for sales of a new jersey design.cite web last=Fisher first=Scott url=http://www.canoe.ca/Slam040521/nhl_calsj5-sun.html  title=Red-hot jersey breaks record publisher=Calgary Sun date=2004-05-21 accessdate=2007-12-06  The tradition of the C of Red dates back to the 1986 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Oilers. Oiler fans were donning hats promoting Hat Trick Fever in their quest for three-peat three straight Stanley Cups. Flames fans countered by wearing red. In the 1987 playoffs against the Winnipeg Jets, the Jets responded to the C of Red by encouraging fans to wear white, creating the Winnipeg White Out.cite web  url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2007/09/06/nhl_wants_trademark_white_out.aspx  title=NHL wants trademark 'White Out' faded out  date=2007-05-09  author=Boyer, Lauren  accessdate=2007-09-06  publisher=The Daily Collegian

Team colours and mascot
Logo
Image:9091Flames sm.gif right thumb 150px Original jerseys, used 19801994
The Flames primary logo is the Flaming C design, introduced when the team came to Calgary in 1980.  The design of the logo has remained constant since it was created, though the Flames use a different coloured logo for the home and away jerseys.  From 1980 until 2000, the home logo was red on a white background, while the road logo was white on a red background.  In 2003, the NHL switched to using coloured jerseys for the home team. The home logo became black, with the road logo red on a white background.  The original Flaming A logo of the Atlanta Flames has been restored for use as a patch denoting the team's alternate captains.  The flaming horse logo was retired in 2007 with the introduction of the new Reebok Rbk Edge jerseys.cite web  url=http://flames.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=336594  title=Flames unveil new look Rbk Edge uniform  date=2007-09-04  accessdate=2007-12-07  publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club

Jerseys
Image:9596Flames sm.gif left thumb 150px Second design, used 19942000
The Flames' original jerseys used red and orange striping.  In 1994, the Flames added black to the team's colour scheme, while also adding a diagonal stripe from the base of the jersey to below the logo.  In 1998, to celebrate the Year of the Cowboy, the Flames introduced their third jersey design, the flaming horse logo on a black background.cite book  title=200607 Calgary Flames Media Guide  publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club  editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean  pages=pg. 4  Two years later, the jersey became the Flames road jersey, while the home jersey was updated to incorporate the same V-style striping on the arms and waist of the jersey.  This jersey was once again relegated to third jersey status in 2003 when the NHL adopted the coloured jerseys for the home team.cite web  url=http://www.statenews.com/index.php/article/2003/01/nhl_039quacked039_up  title=NHL 'quacked' up with hockey jersey switch  author=Karol, Kristofer  accessdate=2007-12-07  publisher=statenews.com  In 2007, with the introduction of the Rbk Edge jersey, the Flames updated their look once again, replacing the horizontal striping with vertical striping down the sides.  To honour the team's heritage, the Flames added the flags of Alberta and Canada as shoulder patches.
