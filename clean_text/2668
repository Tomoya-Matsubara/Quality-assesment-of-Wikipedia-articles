Rachel Chiesley, usually known as Lady Grange (1679–1745), was the wife of James Erskine, Lord Grange, a Scottish lawyer with Jacobite sympathies. After 25 years of marriage and 9 children, the Granges had an acrimonious separation. After Lady Grange produced letters that she claimed were evidence of his treasonable plottings against the Hanoverian government in London, her husband had her kidnapped in 1732. She was incarcerated in various remote locations on the western seaboard of Scotland, including the Monach Isles, Skye and the distant islands of St Kilda.
Lady Grange's father was convicted of murder and she is known to have had a violent temper; initially her absence seems to have caused little comment. News of her plight eventually reached her home town of Edinburgh however, and an unsuccessful rescue attempt was effected by her lawyer, Thomas Hope of Rankeillor. She died in captivity, after being in effect imprisoned for 13 years. Her life has been remembered in poetry, prose and a play.
Early years
Rachel Chiesley was one of ten children born to John Chiesley of Dalry and Margaret Nicholson. The marriage was unhappy and Margaret took her husband to court for alimony. She was awarded 1,700 merks by Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath, the Lord President of the Court of Session. Furious with the result, John Chiesley shot Lockhart dead on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh as he walked home from church on Easter Sunday, 31 March 1689.1 The assailant made no attempt to escape and confessed at his trial, held before the Lord Provost the next day. Two days later he was taken from the Tolbooth to the Mercat Cross on the High Street. His right hand was cut off before he was hanged, and the pistol he had used for the murder was placed round his neck.2 Chiesley's birthday is unknown but she was baptised on 4 February 1679 and was probably born shortly before then, making her about ten years old at the time of her father's execution.3
Marriage
 The date of Chiesley's marriage to James Erskine is uncertain: based on the text of a letter she wrote much later in life, it may have been in 1707 when she was about 28.{{#tag:ref|In a letter written from St Kilda, Lady Grange states that &quot;He told me he loved me two years or he gott me and we lived 25 years together few or non I thought so happy.&quot;4 If her recollection is accurate, 25 years before her kidnapping would give a date of 1707.|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} Erskine was the younger son of Charles Erskine, Earl of Mar and in 1689 his older brother John Erskine, had already inherited the title of the 11th Earl of Mar on their father's death.5{{#tag:ref|The Mar lineage is very old and the numbering of the titles arrived at by more than one system. John Erskine is variously described as the 6th, 11th and 22nd Earl.67|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} These were politically troubled times; the Jacobite cause was still popular in many parts of Scotland, and the younger Earl was nicknamed &quot;Bobbing John&quot; for his varied manoeuverings.8 After playing a prominent role in the Jacobite rebellion of 1715 he was stripped of his title, sent into exile, and never returned to Scotland.9
The young Lady Grange has been described as a &quot;wild beauty&quot;, and it is likely the marriage only took place after she became pregnant. This uncertain background notwithstanding, Lord and Lady Grange led a superficially uneventful domestic life. They divided their time between a town house at the foot of Niddry's Wynd off the High Street in Edinburgh and an estate at Preston (near Prestonpans in East Lothian), where Lady Grange was the factor (or supervisor) for a time.101112 Her husband was a successful lawyer, becoming Lord Justice Clerk in 1710,13 and the marriage produced nine children:

Charlie, born August 170914
Johnnie, born March 1711, died age two months.15
James, born March 1713. He married his uncle &quot;Bobbing&quot; John's daughter Frances. Their son John eventually became Earl of Mar after the title was restored.1617
Mary, born July 1714, who married John Keith the 3rd Earl of Kintore in August 1729.1819
Meggie, who died young in May 1717.20
Fannie, born December 1716.21
Jean, born in December 1717.22
Rachel
John

In addition, Lady Grange miscarried twice and one of the above children is known to have died in 1721.23
However, there was an element of discord below the surface. In late 1717 or early 1718, Erskine received warnings from a friend that he had enemies in the government. At about the same time one of the children's tutors recorded in his diary that Lady Grange was &quot;imperious with an unreasonable temper&quot;.24 Her outbursts were evidently also capable of frightening her younger daughters and it is a remarkable aspect of the story that no action was ever taken by any of Lady Grange's children on her behalf after her kidnapping, the eldest of whom would have been in their early twenties when she was abducted. This may become easier to understand with the knowledge that their mother had previously disinherited all of them, when the youngest were still infants.2526
Kidnap
As the Erksine marriage's trouble increased, Lady Grange's behaviour became increasingly unpredictable. In 1730, the factorship of the Preston estate was removed from her, further increasing her angst. Her discovery of an affair her husband was conducting with a Fanny Lindsay can only have made matters worse. In April of that year, she threatened suicide and to run naked through the streets of Edinburgh. She may have kept a razor under her pillow and attempted to intimidate her husband by reminding him whose daughter she was. On 27 July, she signed a formal letter of separation from James Erskine but things did not improve.27 For example, she barracked her husband in the street and in church and he and one of their children were forced to hide from her in a tavern for two hours or more on one occasion. She intercepted one of his letters and took it to the authorities alleging it was evidence of treason. She is also said to have stood outside the house in Niddry's Wynd, waving the letter and shouting obscenities on at least two occasions. In January 1732 she booked a stagecoach to London and James Erskine and his friends, afraid her presence there would cause them further trouble, decided it was time to take decisive action.28  She was abducted from her home on the night of 22 January by two Highland noblemen, Roderick MacLeod of Berneray and Macdonald of Morar and several of their men. After a bloody struggle, she was taken out of the city in a sedan chair and then on horseback to Wester Polmaise near Falkirk, where she was held until 15 August on the ground floor of an uninhabited tower.29 She was by now over fifty years old. 
From there she was taken west by Peter Fraser (a page of Lord Lovat) and his men through Perthshire. At Balquhidder, according to MacGregor tradition, she was entertained in the great hall, provided with a meal of venison, and slept on a heather bed covered with deerskins.30 The existence of St Fillan's Pool on the River Fillan near Tyndrum would have provided useful cover for her captors: it was regularly used as a cure for insanity, which would have helped to explain her presence to the curious.31 The details of the onward route from there are not clear but it is likely she was taken through Glen Coe to Loch Ness and then through Glen Garry to Loch Hourn on the west coast. After a short delay she was then put on board ship to the Monach Isles. The difficulty of her position must have quickly become evident. She was in the company of men whose loyalty was to clan chieftains rather than the law, and few of them spoke any English at all. Their native Gaelic would have been incomprehensible to her, although as her years of captivity wore on she slowly learned something of the language.32 She complained that young members of the local aristocracy visited her as she waited by the shores of Loch Hourn, but that &quot;they came with design to see me, but not to relieve me&quot;.33
Monach Isles

The Monach Isles, also known as Heisker, lie  west of North Uist in the Outer Hebrides, an archipelago itself lying off the western coast of Scotland. The main islands are Ceann Ear, Ceann Iar and Shivinish, which are all linked at low tide and have a combined area of . The islands are low-lying and fertile, and their population in the 18th century may have been about 100.34{{#tag:ref|The islands were abandoned in 1810 because of overgrazing, but re-settled in 1839. In common with many of the more remote Scottish islands they were then abandoned once more in the mid-20th century. Only lighthouse keepers lived there from the early 1930s until 1942, when they too left.35|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} At the time they were owned by Sir Alexander MacDonald of Sleat, and Lady Grange was housed with his tacksman, another Alexander MacDonald, and his wife. When she complained about her condition, she was told by her host that he had no orders to provide her with either clothes, or food other than the normal fare he and his wife were used to. She lived in isolation for two years, not even being told the name of the island where she was living, and it took her some time to find out who her landlord was. She was there until June 1734, when John and Norman MacLeod from North Uist arrived to move her on. They told her they were taking her to Orkney, but instead set sail for the Atlantic outliers of St Kilda.3637
St Kilda
One of the more poignant ruins on the island of Hirta in the St Kilda archipelago is the site of Lady Grange's House.38 The &quot;house&quot; is in fact a large cleit or stone storage hut in the Village meadows which is said to resemble &quot;a giant Christmas pudding&quot;.39 Some authorities believe it was rebuilt on the site of a larger black house where she lived during her incarceration there,4041 although in 1838 the grandson of a St Kildan who had assisted her quoted the dimensions as being &quot;20 feet by 10 feet&quot; (7 metres by 3 metres), which is roughly the size of the cleit.42  Hirta is an order of magnitude more remote than the Monach Isles, lying  west-northwest of Benbecula in the North Atlantic Ocean43 and the predominant theme of life on St Kilda was isolation. When Martin Martin visited the islands in 1697,44 the only means of making the journey was by open longboat, which could take several days and nights of rowing and sailing across the open ocean and was next to impossible in autumn and winter. In all seasons, waves up to 12 metres (40 ft) high lash the beach of Village Bay, and even on calmer days landing on the slippery rocks can be hazardous. Cut off by distance and weather, the natives knew little of the rest of the world.45
Lady Grange's circumstances were correspondingly more uncomfortable. She described Hirta as &quot;a viled neasty, stinking poor Isle&quot; and insisted that &quot;I was in great miserie in the Husker but I'm ten times worse and worse here&quot;.46 Her lodgings were very primitive. They had an earthen floor, rain ran down the walls and in winter snow had to be scooped out in handfuls from behind the bed.47 She spent her days asleep, drank as much whisky as was available to her, and wandered the shore at night bemoaning her fate. During her sojourn on Hirta she wrote two letters relating her story, which eventually reached Edinburgh. One, dated 20 January 1738, found its way to Thomas Hope of Rankeillor, her lawyer, in December 1740. The letter caused a sensation in Edinburgh but James Erskine's friends managed to block attempts by Hope to obtain a warrant to search St Kilda.{{#tag:ref|In 1732 Lord Lovat had written &quot;But as to that insolent fellow Mr Hope of Eankiller, I would advise him to to [not to] meddle with me, for the moment that I can prove that he attacts my character and reputation by any calumnie I'l certainly pursue him for Scandalum Magnatum.48 |group=&quot;Note&quot;}}  In the second letter, addressed to Dr Carlyle, minister of Inveresk, Lady Grange writes bitterly of the roles of Lord Lovat and Roderick McLeod in her capture and bemoans being described by Sir Alexander MacDonald as &quot;the cargo&quot;.4950{{#tag:ref|No original survives of the second letter, and a copy published in 1819 is dated 1741, which makes little sense as it relates to her time on St Kilda. This may have been the date it was copied.51|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} Hope had known of Lady Grange's removal from Edinburgh but had assumed she would be well cared for. Appalled by her condition, he paid for a sloop with twenty armed men on board to go to St Kilda at his own expense. It had already set sail by 14 February 1741, but it arrived too late.5253{{#tag:ref|Some sources state that the first letter had been hidden in some yarn that was collected as part of a rent payment and taken to Inverness and thence to Edinburgh.54 The idea of the letter's concealment in yarn is also mentioned by Boswell (1785) (see note below). However, Macaulay states that this delivery route for the letter(s) has &quot;no basis in reality&quot; and that both letters were smuggled off Hirta by Roderick MacLennan, the island's minister.55 |group=&quot;Note&quot;}} Lady Grange had been removed from the island, probably in the summer of 1740.56
After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, it was rumoured that Prince Charles Edward Stuart and some of his senior Jacobite aides had escaped to St Kilda. An expedition was launched, and in due course British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When they were persuaded to come down, the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew nothing of the Prince and had never heard of King George II either.57 Paradoxically, Lady Grange's letters and her resultant evacuation from the island, may have prevented her being found by this expedition.{{#tag:ref|Although she died in May 1745 the year before this expedition, her further travails and movements after she left St Kilda may have hastened her demise.58|group=&quot;Note&quot;}}
Skye
 By 1740 Lady Grange was 61 years old. Removed from St Kilda in haste, she was transported to various locations in the G&lt;U+00E0&gt;idhealtachd including possibly Assynt in the far north west of mainland Scotland and the Outer Hebridean locations of Harris and Uist before arriving at Waternish on Skye in 1742.{{#tag:ref|According to a 19th-century source, she learned to spin there, in a repetition of the story relating to St Kilda, managed to smuggle a letter out in a ball of yarn, which then had the result of a government naval vessel being sent out to look for her, although there is no surviving evidence for any of these assertions. The source is Clerk (1845) and Macauley (2009) states that no letter referring to her life on Skye has ever been found, there is no record of any such sailing by a government vessel and that &quot;nor indeed does learning to spin sound quite like Lady Grange's style.&quot;59|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} Local folklore suggests she may have been kept for 18 months in a cave either at Idrigill on the Trotternish peninsula60 or on the Duirinish coast near the stacks known as a &quot;Macleod's Maidens&quot;.61 She was certainly later housed with Rory MacNeil at Trumpan in Waternish. She died there on 12 May 1745, and MacNeil had her &quot;decently interred&quot; the following week in the local churchyard. For reasons unknown a second funeral was held at nearby Duirinish some time thereafter, where a large crowd gathered to watch the burial of a coffin filled with turf and stones.62
It is sometimes stated that this was her third funeral, Lord Grange having conducted one in Edinburgh shortly after her kidnapping.6364 However, this story first appears in writing in 1845 and no other evidence of its existence has emerged.6566
Motivations
By any standards, Lady Grange's story is a remarkable one and several key questions require explanation. Firstly, what drove James Erskine to these extraordinary lengths? Secondly, why were so many individuals willing to participate in this illegal and dangerous kidnapping of his wife, and thirdly how was she held for so long without rescue?
The first and second questions are related. Erskine's brother had already been exiled for his support of the Jacobites. Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, a key figure in Lady Grange's abduction was himself executed for his part in the Jacobite Rising of 1745.67 No concrete evidence of Erskine's plotting against the crown or government has ever emerged, but any threat of such exposure, whether based in fact or fantasy would certainly have been taken very seriously by all concerned. It was thus relatively easy for Erskine to find accomplices amongst the Highland gentry. In addition to Simon Fraser and Alexander Macdonald of Sleat, the Sobieski Stuarts (two English brothers who claimed descent from Prince Charles Edward Stuart){{#tag:ref|Although taken seriously by Lord Lovat, the Sobieski Stuarts' claims were eventually exposed and the Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland states that their publication on the history of clan tartans, Vestiarium Scoticum &quot;is as bogus as its author's descent&quot;.68|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} listed Norman MacLeod of Dunvegan—who became known as &quot;The Wicked Man&quot;—as the senior accomplices.6970
Erskine himself was a &quot;singular compound of good and bad qualities&quot;.71 In addition to his legal career he was elected to Parliament in 1734 and he survived the vicissitudes of the Jacobite rebellions unscathed.72 It is also clear that he was a philanderer and over-partial to claret, whilst at the same time deeply religious.73 This last quality would have been instrumental in any decision not to have his wife assassinated,74 and he did not marry his long-term partner Fanny Lindsay until after he had heard of the first Lady Grange's death.75  The third question is perhaps the easiest to answer. The Hebrides were very remote from the anglophone world in the early 18th century and no reliable naval charts of the area became available until 1776.{{#tag:ref|The failure of the British navy to capture Bonnie Prince Charlie after the Battle of Culloden in 1745 was a major factor in the creation of a new rutter by Murdoch Mackenzie, Hydrographer to the Admiralty, called A Nautical Description researched from 1748 to 1757 and published in 1776. Johan Blaeu's 1654 map was the best available of the area at the time, but even this was not available to the Hanoverian government and military at the time.76|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} Without local assistance and knowledge, finding a captive in this wilderness would have required a significant expeditionary force. Nonetheless, the lack of action taken by Edinburgh society in general and her children in particular to retrieve one of their own is remarkable. The Kirk hierarchy, for example, made no attempt to contact her or convey news of her condition to the capital, yet they could easily have done so. Whatever the call of morality and natural justice may have suggested, it is clear that John Chiesley's daughter did not command a sympathetic audience in her home town.77
There is also little doubt that 18th-century attitudes to women in general were a significant factor. Divorces were complex and divorced mothers were rarely given custody of children.78 Something of James Erskine's attitude to these matters may perhaps be gleaned from the fact that for his first speech in the House of Commons he chose to oppose the repeal of various laws relating to witchcraft. Even in his day this appeared unduly conservative and his perorations were met with laughter, which effectively ended his political career before it had begun.79 Writing in the mid-19th century the Sobieski Stuarts told the tale from the perspective of the descendants of the Highland aristocrats who had been responsible for Chiesley's kidnap and imprisonment. They emphasise Lady Grange's personal shortcomings, although to modern sensibilities these hardly seem good reasons for a judge and Member of Parliament and his wealthy friends to organise an illegal kidnapping and life sentence.80
As for Lady Grange herself, her vituperative outbursts and indulgence in alcohol were clearly important factors in her undoing. Alexander Carlyle described her as &quot;stormy and outrageous&quot;, whilst noting that it was in her husband's interests to exaggerate the nature of her violent emotions.81 Macauley (2009) takes the view that the ultimate cause of her troubles was her reaction to her husband's infidelity. In an attempt to end his relationship with Mrs Lindsay, (who owned a coffee house in Haymarket, Edinburgh), Rachel threatened to expose him as a Jacobite sympathiser. Perhaps she did not understand the magnitude of this accusation and the danger it posed to her husband and his friends, or how ruthless their instincts of self-preservation were likely to be.8283
In literature and the arts
 Rachel Chiesley's tale inspired a romantic poem called &quot;Epistle from Lady Grange to Edward D— Esq&quot; written by William Erskine in 1798{{#tag:ref|Erskine (c. 1769–1822), later Lord Kineder, was a judge with an interest in literature and a mentor to Walter Scott. He &quot;became the nearest and most confidential of all &quot;Scott's Edinburgh associates.&quot; It has not been possible to establish whether or not he was related to Rachel Chiesley.84|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} and a 1905 novel entitled The Lady of Hirta, a Tale of the Isles by W. C. Mackenzie. Edwin Morgan also published a sonnet in 1984 called &quot;Lady Grange on St Kilda&quot;.8586 The Straw Chair is a two-act play by Sue Glover, also about the time on St Kilda, first performed in Edinburgh in 1988.87
Boswell and Johnson discussed the subject during their 1773 tour of the Hebrides. Boswell wrote: &quot;After dinner to-day, we talked of the extraordinary fact of Lady Grange&lt;U+2019&gt;s being sent to St Kilda, and confined there for several years, without any means of relief. Dr Johnson said, if M&lt;U+2019&gt;Leod would let it be known that he had such a place for naughty ladies, he might make it a very profitable island.&quot;{{#tag:ref|In an additional note Boswell added: &quot;The true story of this lady, which happened In this century, is as frightfully romantick as if it had been the fiction of a gloomy fancy. She was the wife of one of the Lords of Session in Scotland, a man of the very first blood of his country. For some mysterious reasons, which have never been discovered, she was seized and carried off in the dark, she knew not by whom, and by nightly journies was conveyed to the Highland shores, from whence she was transported by sea to the remote rock of St Kilda, where she remained, amongst its few wild inhabitants, a forlorn prisoner, but had a constant supply of provisions, and a woman to wait on her. No inquiry was made after her, till she at last found means to convey a letter to a confidential friend, by the daughter of a Catechist who concealed it in a clue of yarn. Information being thus obtained at Edinburgh, a ship was sent to bring her off; but intelligence of this being received, she was conveyed to M&lt;U+2019&gt;Leod&lt;U+2019&gt;s island of Herries, where she died.&quot;88|group=&quot;Note&quot;}}
There are portraits of both James Erksine and Rachel Chiesley in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh, by Sir John Baptiste de Medina and William Aikman respectively. When the writer Margaret Macauley sought them out she discovered they had been placed together in the same cold store.89
