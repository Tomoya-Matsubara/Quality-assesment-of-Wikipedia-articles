The Lucky-S incident occurred on January 7, 1993 when members of the Turkish Narcotic Police on Turkish Navy vessels intercepted the MV Lucky-S, a Turkish ocean freighter in Mediterranean international waters. The ship was suspected of being involved in smuggling drug into Turkey.1
It was the second drug operation on high sea within three weeks following the K&lt;U+0131&gt;smetim-1 incident.  cannabis and  morphine base2 were captured on the ship, which was escorted to a Turkish port.
Trial
Eleven people in total were found to have been involved in the drug trade.3
Nejat Da&lt;U+015F&gt;, who was found to have organized drug trafficking by the MV K&lt;U+0131&gt;smetim-1 and was imprisoned, escaped the prison on November 8, 1994, as he was brought for trial from Sinop Fortress Prison to the 1st State Security Court in Istanbul due to his involvement in the Lucky-S incident. On March 16, 1995, he was sentenced in absentia to 24-year heavy prison.4
