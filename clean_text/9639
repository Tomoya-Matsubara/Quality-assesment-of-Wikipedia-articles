RAF Warwick is a former Royal Air Force relief landing ground located  south west of Warwick, Warwickshire, England,  east of Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire. RAF Warwick was opened on a large grass field called Tournament field1 in December 1941 and was closed on the 4th February 1946.2
Based units
The first unit to use the station was No. 1 Flying Instructors School (FIS) operating Airspeed Oxfords and Avro Tutors which taught flying instructors. The main base was RAF Church Lawford but Warwick and RAF Hockley Heath were satellites where aircraft were dispersed. 1FIS was previously No. 2 Central Flying School but changed to the current name on 13 January 1941. On 27 October 1942 1FIS was disbanded and turned into No.18 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit.3
No.18 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit ((P)AFU) flew Oxfords and Boulton Paul Defiants mainly from RAF Church Lawford but Warwick and other stations were used as satellites. The unit operated between 27 October 1942 and 29 May 1945.4
