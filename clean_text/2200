All the Lovers is a midtempo electropop song with prominent synthesizers, that has been compared to Minogue's 2004 single I Believe in You Kylie Minogue song I Believe in You. Its lyrics are an invitation to the dancefloor, while comparing previous relationships to one's current lover.

The song has reached the top twenty in Australia, Belgium, Japan and Russia, and peaking inside the top ten in countries such as Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.

The chorus effect chorus has a strong Synthpop synth line that according to Markovitz, wouldve been the perfect main-menu soundtrack for an Atari game of Studio 54. After the second chorus, Minogue's breathy vocals are backed solely by piano and string arrangements.

Reception
Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song five stars and described it as a a classy, danceable and effortlessly elegant electro-disco-pop tune - in other words, A Proper Kylie Single and added that the chorus is instantly infectious in a 'put your arms in the air like you just don't care' kinda way. A reviewer from Popjustice commented, As well as being the sound of dancefloor stampedes from now until the end of time 'All the Lovers' is also the sound of a million Kylie fans breathing a collective sigh of relief. It's grown up but carefree, bombastic yet delicate, sober in spirit and drunk on love. ... It is very hard not to listen to this song on repeat.cite web url=http://www.popjustice.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4704&Itemid=279 title=Song of the Day date=2010-05-13 accessdate=2010-06-02 last=Staff first=Reporter work=Popjustice publisher=Peter Robinson journalist Peter Robinson Adam Markovitz of Entertaiment Weekly said All the Lovers will likely reach near-ubiquity in gyms, gay clubs, and clothing stores and added The dance floor can wait; were too busy enjoying this to get up right now.

Development and synopsis
The music video for All the Lovers was filmed on May 8 and May 9, 2010 in downtown Los Angeles, California. It was directed by Joseph Kahn, who was reportedly chosen by Minogue since he could give the video a fresh, new feel.cite web url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1275665/Kylie-Minogue-surrounded-half-naked-extras-All-The-Lovers-music-video.html?ito=feeds-newsxml title=Kylie Minogue surrounded by half-naked extras for All The Lovers music video   Mail Online date=2010-05-10 accessdate=2010-06-02 last=Bull first=Sarah work=Daily Mail publisher=Daily Mail and General Trust The concept is a re-imagination of works by American artist Spencer Tunick, known for his installations that feature large numbers of nude people. Kahn and Minogue created two treatments for the video, but chose the edgier option.cite web url=http://www.blackbookmag.com/article/mighty-aphrodite-kylie-minogue/19453 title=Kylie Minogue: Mighty Aphrodite - BlackBook date=2010-06-14 accessdate=2010-06-19 last=Haramis first=Nick work=BlackBook Magazine publisher=BlackBook Media Corporation Minogue wears jewelry from designer Shaun Leane.cite web url=http://www.retail-jeweller.com/news/kylie-wears-shaun-leane-in-latest-music-video/5014560.article title=Kylie wears Shaun Leane in latest music video   News   Retail Jeweller date=2010-06-25 accessdate=2010-06-27 last=Knowles first=James work=Retail Jeweller publisher=EMAP The video begins with a flash mob of people dropping items with QR Code on them.

People go nuts over it, so thats amazing. Kahn came up with a brilliant, simple idea and executed it so sensitively, I thought. Its still cutting edge, it still gets you a little hot under the collar, but I think theres a real sensitivity. Its what Im about and what I love. ... What I'm so thrilled about is the energy that comes through and that oneness. ... It is a perfect and genuine expression of how I feel about sexuality and sensuality.

Reception
Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called it a striptease-in-the-streets party of epic and epically horny proportions and added, the result is best described as either a makeout flash mob, a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade gone wild, or some serious 'the touch, the feel of cotton' guerrilla marketing. Kurt B. Reighley of Queer Sight commented, Yet for all the sexy filling the screen, the video never seems dirty or vulgar, because director Joseph Kahn punctuates it with wholesome images of everything white imaginable ... The choreography, while incredibly simple, is much more powerful than Laurie Ann Gibson's clunky footwork for Lady Gaga's Alejandro song Alejandro clip, and Kylie's stylists continue to refine an image that suggests nothing so much as Sanrio Toys the makers of Hello Kitty vision of Charlie's Angels.cite web url=http://galina.queersighted.com/2010/06/10/kylie-minogue-presents-the-worlds-sexiest-flash-mob/ title=Kylie Minogue Presents the World's Sexiest Flash Mob - Queer Sighted date=2010-06-10 accessdate=2010-06-19 last=Reighley first=Kurt B. work=Queer Sight publisher=AOL Ryan Brockington of the New York Post said, Taking a cue from videos by Matt & Kim, Make the Girl Dance and nakedly nasty Erykah Badu most recently, Kylie has decided to commercialize on the attention a clothes-free video conjures up.

I'm just saying it's not as 'umphy' as its ancestors.cite web url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/sexified_shots_from_kylie_lovers_7fSd35hpxfSPRuPI9ljgMO title=Kylie Minogue - 'All the Lovers' video - PopWrap date=2010-06-01 accessdate=2010-06-02 last=Brockington first=Ryan work=New York Post publisher=News Corporation Nick Levine of Digital Spy commented, There aren't many popstars who could make a video featuring doves, balloons, a galloping horse, a giant inflatable elephant and a mass grope-fest in the middle of LA.... and get away with it. Then again, there aren't many popstars who engender the collective affection that Kylie Minogue does.
