 Controversy 

On April 25, 2014 it was announced that Hundred Proof Club, Think Famous Productions, Akela Family and JDK Entertainment were suing Sony Music and King for fraud in the Sony and FIFA's SuperSong competition. The lawsuit claimed that the competition was rigged and that King, who co-wrote Vida was always going to win, cheating the other entrants out of their chance of winning the competition. Although the contest was open to applicants worldwide, King had a contractual agreement and Sony apparently asked King to enter the song Vida: Sony allegedly pressured the plaintiffs to release King from his contract so that he would be eligible to win, in return for compensation.cite news url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/23/sony-supersong-lawsuit_n_5201298.html title=Sony Accused Of Fraud In FIFA World Cup SuperSong Contest work=The Huffington Post last1=Moreno first1=Carolina last2=Fridmann first2=Mandy date=April 23, 2014 accessdate=April 30, 2014

The lawsuit alleges that Sony induced Kings release from his publishing contract and refused to pay compensation. The attorney Alicia Roman told The Huffington Post, Were looking to annul the release due to the fraud they committed. When its annulled, all of the rights to Elijahs songs are returned to my client, particularly the song 'Vida' that Ricky Martin sang. Martin has not made any comment on the lawsuit. Additionally, Luis Adrian Cortes Ramos, a finalist from the Idol Puerto Rico season 1 first season of Idol Puerto Rico filled a $10 million lawsuit towards Martin. He sued the singer for releasing Vida despite claims that he submitted his version of the track as part of SuperSong contest, a version that was never recognized. Ramos' lawyer released a statement saying Ramos was surprised, disillusioned and suffered mental anguish because the song was almost identical to the one he composed. Until that moment, Martin was an idol for Ramos.cite web url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/entertainment/celebrities_gossip/20140804_WENN_Ricky_Martin_sued_over_World_Cup_song_Vida.html title=Ricky Martin sued over World Cup song Vida publisher=Philadelphia Media Network date=August 5, 2014 accessdate=December 9, 2014 However, Martin's representative never commented on the lawsuit.

Redman concluded that it is better than Pitbull rapper Pitbull's We Are One Ole Ola, which serves as the official song of the tournament. Mike Wass of website Idolator website Idolator wrote, there's something to be said for consistency and Ricky sure knows how to knock out a summery smash with generic Spanglish lyrics that probably sound pretty inspiring after a couple of Corona beer Coronas.
