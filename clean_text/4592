 Kochari (; ; ; ; Laz: Ko&lt;U+00E7&gt;ari; ), is a folk dance from the Kars1 and Artvin provinces of Turkey.
This culturally rich region consisting of Kars, Ardahan, and Artvin provinces has historically been part of many kingdoms and nations including Kingdom of Pontus and Kingdom of Armenia.
In many Turkic languages, Kochari means &quot;nomad&quot; (K&lt;U+00F6&gt;&lt;U+00E7&gt;&lt;U+0259&gt;ri, Gochar, Go&lt;U+00E7&gt;ede).
Kochari is closely related to the &quot;Haleh&quot; or &quot;Halay&quot;, a dance common to Turks, Armenians, and Kurds, and although there are differences the most basic form of the Armenian Halay is the same as Kochari.
&quot;Govand&quot; is also part of this family of dances.
Pontic kotsari
The Pontic Greeks2 and Armenians have many vigorous warlike dances such as the Kochari.
Unlike most Pontic dances, the Kotsari is in an even rhythm (2/4), originally danced in a closed circle. The dance is very popular today; however, it is often danced differently from the original. There is a consistent, vicious double bounce, also referred to as tremoulo. It is danced hand to shoulder and travels to the right. There are few variations which may be added to the step. It's a dance that tries to fear the viewers. At the start, it is danced by both men and women. Then, men go in front and do their figures.
