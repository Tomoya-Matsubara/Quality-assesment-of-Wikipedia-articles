 Vasiliki &quot;Vicky&quot; Pryce, CB1 (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Courmouzis, ; born 1952)2 is a Greek-born economist, and former Joint Head of the United Kingdom's Government Economic Service.3
Early life
She was born in Athens, the daughter of Nicolas and Voula Courmouzis. She studied at the LSE, gaining a BSc in Economics and an MSc in Monetary Economics.
Career
After university she had a &quot;glittering career&quot;4 as an economist and then chief economist at Williams &amp; Glyn's Bank (now part of the Royal Bank of Scotland) from 1973 to 1983, as chief economist at KPMG from 1986 to 2001 starting as Peat Marwick McLintock, and corporate economist for Exxon Europe from 1983 to 1986.5 When having children, she took six weeks off for each child. She left KPMG at Blackfriars in late 2001, and worked for the London Economics consultancy.
DTI
Pryce joined the Department for Trade and Industry in August 2002 as Chief Economic Adviser, the first woman to be appointed to the post, for which the salary was about &lt;U+00A3&gt;110,000.6 She was also Chairman of the GoodCorporation, an organisation promoting ethical business practices.
She was Deputy Head of the Government's Economic Service from 2004 to 2007, and Joint Head from 2007 to 2010.
In April 2010, it was announced7 that she would be leaving the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills where she was Director General, Economics, and Joint Head of the Government Economic Service,8 to become senior managing director at the finance consultancy firm FTI Consulting.9
Academia
She has been a visiting professor at City University's Cass Business School from 2002-6 and since 2008, and at Imperial College Business School since 2010; a visiting Fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford since 2008; a Fellow of the Society of Business Economists since 2005, and has sat on the Council of the University of Kent since 2005 and of the Royal Society for the Arts from 2008-9.10 She was a Member on the Council of the Royal Economic Society (REconS) from 2002-7.
In 2010 she became the Master of the Worshipful Company of Management Consultants.11
Greekonomics
In October 2012, Biteback Publishing brought out her book, Greekonomics, a discussion of the crises in the eurozone, with the focus especially as the title indicates on the country of her birth. This book is intended for a broad, not merely an academic, audience.
It paints a vivid picture of what a Greek exit from the eurozone might mean: &quot;A serious possibility of exit -- and how could it be kept completely secret? -- would lead to a full-scale run on the banks. Clearly any country wishing to exit the eurozone would have to nationalize or take temporary control of the banks and reintroduce controls on the movement of capital. The government would also need to reintroduce stringent border controls to stop people leaving the country with euro notes and coins in their luggage or in their underwear! In countries like Greece, where taking to the streets is part of the political way of life, the population would probably react by attempting to physically remove their savings, breaking into the banks -- and then for good measure attacking Parliament. So in Greece a euro exit could easily end with troops on the streets and martial law -- just the circumstances that joining the EU was meant to prevent.&quot;
Personal life
In 1972 she married an LSE academic with the surname of Pryce, whom she divorced in 1981, having had two daughters with him.12
In 1984, Pryce married Chris Huhne, who later became an MEP and then the Liberal Democrat MP for Eastleigh and Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change. They had three children together.13 They divorced in January 2011.1415
She is currently in a relationship with the ex-minister and former MP Denis MacShane, who resigned as an MP in 2012 due to submitting false expenses invoices stemming from the United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal.161718
Prosecution

Pryce was interviewed twice by Essex Police in 2011 over allegations that she had accepted penalty points incurred by Huhne in 2003.19 On 24 December 2011, it was reported that Essex Police had recommended to the Crown Prosecution Service that both Pryce and Huhne should be prosecuted for perverting the course of justice, contrary to common law.2021 The CPS stated that they would not be taking a decision about whether to institute criminal proceedings against Pryce until judicial review proceedings in relation to Essex Police's attempts to obtain a court order to compel the Sunday Times to disclose emails between Pryce and its political editor had been disposed of.22 On 20 January 2012, the Sunday Times withdrew its application for judicial review. Andrew Edis QC, acting for Essex Police, told the Administrative Court that the &quot;proceedings [were moving] on towards a charging decision&quot;.23
On 3 February 2012 the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC announced that Pryce and Huhne would be charged with perverting the course of justice.24 Pryce, together with Huhne, appeared before Mr Justice Saunders in the Crown Court at Southwark on 2 March 2012. A trial was listed for 2 October 2012. Both defendants were granted unconditional bail.25 At a plea and case management hearing on 1 June 2012, Pryce entered a plea of not guilty, and it was announced that she would be advancing a defence of marital coercion at trial. Her unconditional bail was extended until the start of the trial.26 On 28 January 2013, a new trial date was set as 4 February 2013, after Huhne was arraigned and pleaded &quot;not guilty&quot; to the indictment.27 However, when he appeared, Huhne changed his plea to guilty, and now faces the prospect of a prison term. He has resigned as an MP, triggering a by-election.
On 20 February 2013, the judge ordered a retrial after the jury was unable to reach a verdict.28 On 7 March 2013, she was convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.29
