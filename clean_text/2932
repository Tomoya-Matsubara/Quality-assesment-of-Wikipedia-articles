The Calgary Hitmen are a junior ice hockey Major Junior ice hockey team based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  The Hitmen play in the Western Hockey League WHL.  They play their home games at the Pengrowth Saddledome.  Their name is derived from Calgary-born professional wrestling wrestler Bret Hart Bret The Hitman Hart.  Established in 1994, the team has been owned by the Calgary Flames hockey club since 1997.  They are the third WHL team to represent Calgary, preceded by the Calgary Centennials Centennials and Calgary Wranglers Wranglers.

The Hitmen have twice finished with the Scotty Munro Memorial Trophy best record in the WHL, and have qualified for the playoffs every season since 1998.  In 1999, the Hitmen became the first Calgary team to win the Ed Chynoweth Cup President's Cup as league champions, and the first to represent Calgary in the Memorial Cup since the Calgary Canadians won the national junior title in 1926.  The Hitmen hold numerous WHL attendance records, and in 200405 became the first team in the Canadian Hockey League to average 10,000 fans per game.  Twenty-one former Hitmen players have gone on to play in the National Hockey League.

History
Graham James left his position as coach and general manager of the Swift Current Broncos to found the Hitmen in 1994.cite news  first=Larry  last=Tucker  title=Ice dreams  work=Calgary Sun  date=1995-10-24 James organized a group of eighteen investors in the club, including star National Hockey League players Theoren Fleury and Joe Sakic along with WWE World Wrestling Federation wrestler Bret Hart.cite news  first=Mike  last=Board  title=Flames take a shot at owning Hitmen  work=Calgary Herald  page=E1-E2  date=1997-06-14  The Calgary Flames, who had just assumed control of the Olympic Saddledome now Pengrowth Saddledome and were looking to fill extra dates in the building, were receptive to the new team.cite news  first=Larry  last=Tucker  title=Method to this madness  page=62  work=Calgary Sun  date=1994-06-24

Calgary had been without a WHL team since 1987, when the Calgary Wranglers moved south to become the Lethbridge Hurricanes.cite news  first=Eric  last=Francis  title=Hitmen home run  work=Calgary Sun  date=1995-10-07  The league's expansion into Calgary was met with skepticism, as the league had previously avoided Western Canada's largest markets of Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary and Winnipeg, because all previous teams there repeatedly failed in each market against the NHL.

Controversial beginnings

The club selected its name and logo as an homage to Calgary's Bret The Hitman Hart. The team's distinctive pink, grey and black jerseys were also modeled after Hart's ring attire.cite news  first=Eric  last=Francis  title=It's the Hitmen!  work=Calgary Sun  page = 41  date=1994-11-30  The logo proved immensely popular and Hitmen merchandise sold well at many local retailers.cite news  first=Eric  last=Francis  title=Fans can't get enough of Hitmen  work=Calgary Sun  page=37  date=1995-01-11   However, the name and logo were subject to heavy criticism from segments of the public and the business community, who panned both as negative stereotypes of violence within the sport.cite news  first=George  last=Johnson  title=Hitmen under fire  work=Calgary Sun  page=40  date=1994-12-13 Among the chief critics of the new logo was the Flames organization, who argued that they had received calls from concerned business people, who agreed the name and logo brought up connotations of violence.cite news  first=Larry  last=Tucker  title='Hit' put on Hitmen  work=Calgary Sun  page=S3  date=1995-01-14  Struggling to attract corporate sponsors, the Hitmen chose to scrap the Jason Voorhees-style logo in favour of an alternate starburst logo just two months after it was unveiled.cite news  first=Eric  last=Francis  title=Hitmen logo nixed  work=Calgary Sun  page=51  date=1995-01-16 The club brought the original logo back in 1996.cite web  url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070510232710/http://www.brethart.com/column/april30-2004.asp  title=Bret Hart's Calgary Sun column for April 30, 2004  author = Hart, Bret  accessdate=2008-04-13  date=2004-04-30  work=Calgary Sun via brethart.com

The Hitmen entered their first season playing in the newly-formed Central Division, and were predicted to finish as high as third in the five-team division.cite news  first=Eric  last=Francis  title=And they're off  work=Calgary Sun  page = 61  date=1995-10-07  Instead, they finished with the second-worst record in the league with an 18&ndash;51&ndash;3 record 18 wins, 51 losses and three ties.cite book  editor=Flett, Cory and Watts, Jessie  title=200708 WHL Guide  publisher=Western Hockey League  pages=158  The Hitmen lost Canadian Dollar CAD$250,000 in their first season and saw their season ticket base halved to 700 for the 1996-97 WHL season 199697 season. The losses lead to questions about the viability of the club.cite news  first=Tom  last=Keyser  title=Growing pains  work=Calgary Herald  page=D3  date=1996-09-21

Citing personal reasons, James resigned as coach and general manager on September 5, 1996, stunning the organization.cite news  first=Eric  last=Francis  title=Shocking departure  work=Calgary Sun  page=S6  date=1996-09-07cite news  author1=Wildon, Suzanne  author2=Francis, eric  title=City police investigating former coach  work=Calgary Sun  page=4  date=1996-09-07 Two days later, the Calgary Police Service revealed that James was being investigated on allegations he sexual abuse sexually abused two former players while he was with the Swift Current Broncos.cite news  author=Wilton, Suzanne and Francis, Eric  title=City police investigating former coach  work=Calgary Sun  page=4  date=1996-09-07  James was eventually charged, and in January 1997, James plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault.cite news  title= Ex-Coach Pleads Guilty  url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E3D61439F937A35752C0A961958260  work=The New York Times  date=1997-01-04  accessdate=2008-03-21  Upon James' conviction, and sentencing to 3 1/2&nbsp;years in prison, the Hitmen attempted to distance themselves from their former coach.cite news  first=James  last=Deacon  title=Hockey Coach Guilty of Sexual Assault  url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=M1ARTM0011058  work=Macleans Magazinevia The Canadian Encyclopedia  date=1997-01-13 accessdate=2008-03-21

The Hitmen struggled on the ice as well, again missing the playoffs after falling to a record of 15534.cite book  editor=Flett, Cory and Watts, Jessie  title=200708 WHL Guide  publisher=Western Hockey League  pages=4041  The spectre of the Graham James scandal hurt the franchise. The original investors, many of whom played for or were otherwise associated with James, sold the team to the Flames for approximately $1.5&nbsp;million in June 1997.cite news  first=Mark  last=Miller  title=Hitmen finally go up in Flames  work=Calgary Sun  page=S5  date=1997-06-14  It was widely speculated that the new owners would change the team name, possibly to the Junior Flames. The Hitmen name was nevertheless retained by the club with a new colour scheme and updated logo.
