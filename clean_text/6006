 There are 51 Grade I listed buildings in Bristol, England.
In England and Wales the authority for listing is granted by the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and is presently administered by English Heritage, an agency of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. In Bristol the city council maintains the list of Grade I listed buildings.1
In the United Kingdom the term listed building refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical or cultural significance. Grade I buildings are described as being &quot;buildings of outstanding or national architectural or historic interest&quot;.
Several of the entries relate to more than one listed structure where these have been group together as part of the same geographical location or where ancillary structures, such as the walls and gate in front of a building, are listed separately.

Notes


Grid reference is based on the British national grid reference system, also known as OSGB36, and is the system used by the Ordnance Survey.53

References are to the data sheets for each site on Images of England which is funded by English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund, to create a 'point in time' photographic record of England's listed buildings. The list is of the buildings listed at the turn of the millennium; it is not an up-to-date record of all currently listed buildings. The listing status and descriptions shown on the Images of England website are the listings as at February 2001.
