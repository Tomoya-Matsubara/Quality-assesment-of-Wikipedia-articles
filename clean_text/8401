Captain Wolfgang August Eugen L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th (15 October 1913 – 14 May 1945) was the second most successful German U-boat ace of World War II. His career record of 46 merchant ships plus the French submarine Doris sunk during 15 war patrols, with a total displacement of , was second only to that of Korvettenkapit&lt;U+00E4&gt;n Otto Kretschmer, whose 47 sinkings totaled .1
L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th joined the Reichsmarine in 1933. After a period of training on surface vessels he transferred to the U-boat service in 1936. In December 1939 he received command of U-9, which he took on six war-patrols. In June 1940 he took command of U-138 for two patrols. In October 1940 he transferred again, this time to the ocean-going U-43 submarine for five war-patrols. After two war-patrols, the second being his longest of the war, on U-181 he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillianten). He was the first of two U-boat commanders to be honored in such a way during World War II, the other recipient being Albrecht Brandi.
L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th's last service position was commander of the Naval Academy M&lt;U+00FC&gt;rwik at Flensburg-M&lt;U+00FC&gt;rwik. He was accidentally shot and killed by a German sentry on the night of 13 to 14 May 1945. L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th was given the last state funeral of the Third Reich, the only U-boat commander to be so honored.2
Biography
L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th was a Baltic German born in Riga in the Russian Empire. Here he went to the Naturwissenschaftliches Gymnasium and, after he had received his Abitur, he studied Law for three semesters at the Herder-Institut. With his parents approval he joined the Reichsmarine on 1 April 1933. After he received his military basic training he was transferred to the school ship Gorch Fock attaining the rank of Seekadett on 23 September, 1933. He served with surface fleet at first, going on a 9-month training tour around the world in the light cruiser Karlsruhe in 1934, and served for a year aboard the light cruiser K&lt;U+00F6&gt;nigsberg.3
In February 1937 he transferred to the U-boat arm. In July he was appointed 2nd Watch Officer of U-27, with which he sailed on a patrol in Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War. In October he was appointed the 1st Watch Officer of U-38 under the command of Kapit&lt;U+00E4&gt;nleutnant Heinrich Liebe, who during the course of World War II would earn the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub). L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th was on patrol with U-38 when the war started on 1 September 1939.4
On board U-9
On 30 December 1939 L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th took command of U-9, a Type IIB U-boat. With this boat he went on six war-patrols, achieving successes steadily, including sinking the French submarine Doris on 9 May 1940 and 7 merchant ships of . Two of L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th's officers on U-9 would be awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes). His Leitender Ingenieur (chief engineer) Oberleutnant zur See Karl-Heinz Wiebe received the Knight's Cross in 1944 as chief engineer of U-178. Oberleutnant zur See Heinrich Schonder, 1st Watch Officer on U-9 between January and April 1940, earned the award in 1942 as commander of U-77.5
On board U-138
On 27 June 1940 L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th took command of U-138, a Type IID, with which he sunk 4 ships on his first patrol, totalling . In October, after having returned from his second patrol, on which he torpedoed (but missed) the Norwegian merchant steamer Dagrun (), sank the British merchant steamer Bonheur () and damaged the British motor tanker British Glory (). L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th was mentioned for the first time in the daily Wehrmachtbericht on 23 September 1940 and received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) for his achievements on 24 October 1940.6
On board U-43
On 21 October 1940 L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th took command of U-43, a long range Type IX U-boat. With this boat he made five patrols totaling 204 days at sea, sinking 12 ships adding up to . On 1 January 1941 he was promoted to Kapit&lt;U+00E4&gt;nleutnant. L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th, because of his experience — like many other top commanders — was tasked to train future U-boat commanders. These U-boat commander trainees often came along on single war-patrols, which would be their last exercise before they received their own U-boat command. Kapit&lt;U+00E4&gt;nleutnant Erich W&lt;U+00FC&gt;rdemann was one of L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th's trainees and sailed onboard of U-43 from April to July 1941. W&lt;U+00FC&gt;rdemann would be awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross as commander of U-506 in 1943 before he was killed in action on 14 July 1943.7
On board U-181
On 9 May 1942 L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th was given command of a long-range Type IXD-2 U-boat, U-181. He left on his first patrol in September 1942, departing from Kiel. The target of this patrol was the Indian Ocean and South African waters. In October he reached the sea lanes outside Cape Town and spent a month patrolling, sinking 12 ships for  before returning to Bordeaux, France, in January 1943. On 13 November 1942 he received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub).8
In March 1943 L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th set out for a second patrol off South Africa into the Indian Ocean and in particular the waters around Mauritius. This patrol lasted 205 days (23 March 1943 – 14 October 1943) making it the second longest of the war (The longest combat patrol of World War II was 225 days in length, and this was achieved by Eitel-Friedrich Kentrat as commander of the U-196.) L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th sank 10 ships totaling  on this patrol, which turned out to be his last. While on patrol he was promoted to Korvettenkapit&lt;U+00E4&gt;n on 1 April 1943, and on 15 April 1943 received news that he had been awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern).9
U-181 rendezvoused with the supply ship Charlotte Schliemann east of Mauritius to refuel on 21 June 1943. Also present at the supply point were U-177 under the command of Robert Gysae, U-178 under the command of Wilhelm Dommes, U-196 under the command of Eitel-Friedrich Kentrat, U-197 under the command of Robert Bartels and U-198 under the command of Werner Hartmann. Here the commanders exchanged experiences and discussed the problem of torpedo failures. On 9 August of the same year and still on patrol, L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillianten).1011
L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th nominated two crew members of U-181 for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross after this patrol. The chief engineer Kapit&lt;U+00E4&gt;nleutnant Carl-August Landfermann and 2nd Watch Officer Johannes Limbach both received the Knight's Cross for their achievements.12
After five years of operational U-boat service, including 15 war-patrols and over 600 days at sea, L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th took command of 22. Unterseebootsflottille in January 1944. This was a training unit for U-boat commanders. In July 1944 he took command of the 1st Department of the Marineschule M&lt;U+00FC&gt;rwik (Naval Academy M&lt;U+00FC&gt;rwik) in Flensburg-M&lt;U+00FC&gt;rwik. He was promoted to Fregattenkapit&lt;U+00E4&gt;n on 1 August 1944 and became the commander of the entire Marineschule in September, and advanced in rank to Kapit&lt;U+00E4&gt;n zur See.13
Death
 The British Forces had occupied Flensburg on 5 May 1945, though initially nothing changed in the daily routine at the Naval Academy M&lt;U+00FC&gt;rwik. On the night of 13 to 14 May 1945 L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th was shot in the head by 18 year-old Matrose Mathias Gottlob, a German sentry at the Flensburg-M&lt;U+00FC&gt;rwik Naval Academy, when he failed to respond to the sentry's challenge. The password of the day was &quot;Tannenberg&quot;. Whether he deliberately failed to respond, perhaps in order to commit suicide, or if the guard simply did not hear his response, is unknown. The officer in charge immediately informed Gro&lt;U+00DF&gt;admiral Karl D&lt;U+00F6&gt;nitz. D&lt;U+00F6&gt;nitz adjudant Fregattenkapit&lt;U+00E4&gt;n Walter L&lt;U+00FC&gt;dde-Neurath, who accepted the call, initially thought that this was a bad joke. L&lt;U+00FC&gt;dde-Neurath then informed L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th's brother, Joachim L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th, as the two brothers were staying together. It was he who informed L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th's wife and their four children that L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th had died.14
D&lt;U+00F6&gt;nitz contacted the British city commander of Flensburg, Colonel Roberts, asking him for a permission to conduct a formal state funeral, which Roberts approved. The last state funeral of the Third Reich was held for L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th on 16 May 1945 with Adolf Hitler's successor as Head of State, Reichspr&lt;U+00E4&gt;sident and Gro&lt;U+00DF&gt;admiral Karl D&lt;U+00F6&gt;nitz, delivering the eulogy.15 Six U-boat commanders, all of them recipients of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, formed the honour guard.16
D&lt;U+00F6&gt;nitz ordered a board of inquiry and court martial to clarify the circumstances of the deadly shooting. Four officers under the command of a Navy Judge conducted the court martial. Mathias Gottlob stated that, according to his orders, had asked for the password three times without response from the person, whom he could not visually identify in the darkness. Without aiming he had fired his rifle from the hip. The chain of events was confirmed by the Maschinenmaat Karl Franz, who was leading the watch at the time. The court ruled that Gottlob was not guilty and he was cleared of any fault in the killing of Kapit&lt;U+00E4&gt;n zur See Wolfgang L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th.17
Summary of career
During his career L&lt;U+00FC&gt;th sunk 46 commercial ships for , one warship of , and damaged two ships for .18 His last patrol saw U-181 at sea for 206 days, patrolling the waters beween Capetown and Madagascar, making it the second-longest patrol of the war.19
