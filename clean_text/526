Robert Joseph &quot;Bob&quot; Cousy (born August 9, 1928 in New York City) is a former American professional basketball player. The 6'1&quot;, 175 lbs. Cousy played point guard with the National Basketball Association's (NBA) Boston Celtics from 1951 to 1963 and briefly with the Cincinnati Royals in the 1969-70 season. Born to French immigrants, Cousy had a highly successful career with the Celtics, winning six championship rings, being voted into 13 All-Star and 12 All-NBA First and Second Teams and winning the NBA Most Valuable Player Award in 1957.1
In his first 11 NBA years, Cousy won eight consecutive assist titles and introduced a new blend of ball-handling and passing skills, earning him the nicknames &quot;The Cooz&quot; and &quot;Houdini of the Hardwood&quot;.2 After his player career, he coached the Royals for several years, even making a short comeback for the Royals at age 41, and finally became a broadcaster for Celtics games. He was elected into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1971, and in his honor, the Celtics retired his number 14 jersey and hung it into the rafters of the Boston Garden, where it has remained since.3 Cousy was named to the NBA 25th Anniversary Team in 1971, NBA 35th Anniversary Team in 1981, and NBA 50 Greatest Players in 1996, being one of only four players that were selected into all those teams. Today, Cousy serves as Marketing Consultant of the Celtics, alongside his occasional broadcast appearances with Mike Gorman and ex-Celtic teammate Tom Heinsohn.4
Early years
Cousy was born as the son of poor French immigrants. He grew up in the Yorkville neighborhood on the East Side of Manhattan, New York City, in the midst of the Great Depression. His father was a taxi driver who earned extra income by moonlighting. Cousy Jr. spent his early days playing stickball in a multicultural environment, regularly playing with African-American, Jewish and other children from ethnic minorities. These experiences ingrained him with a strong anti-racist sentiment, an attitude that was prominent in his professional career.5 After his cab-driving father had saved $500, he moved his family to Queens, New York.
Cousy attended Andrew Jackson High School in St. Albans, and took up basketball at the age of 13 and was &quot;immediately hooked&quot;.6 However, his success was not immediate and he was cut twice from the school team. In that same year, Cousy fell out of a tree and broke his right hand. It forced him to play left-handed until his hand healed, to a point he became effectively ambidextrous. In retrospect, Cousy described this accident as a &quot;fortunate event&quot; and cited it as a factor in him becoming a better player.7 In 1946, he accepted a basketball scholarship at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts just 40 miles outside of Boston. However, he got into trouble with coach Alvin Julian, who accused Cousy of being a showboater. In the mid-1940s, basketball was a static game, depending on slow, deliberate player movement and flat-footed shots, different to Cousy's uptempo, streetball-like game defined by ambidextrous, behind-the-back dribbles, and also by no-look, behind-the-back and half-court passes.8 In the next two years, Julian limited his playing time, to the point that the frustrated sophomore contemplated a transfer.
Cousy's fate changed in a match against Loyola of Chicago at the Boston Garden. With five minutes left to play and Holy Cross trailing, the crowd started to chant &quot;We want Cousy! We want Cousy!&quot; until coach Julian relented. In these few minutes, Cousy scored 11 points and hit a game-winning buzzer beater after a behind-the-back dribble. The performance established Cousy in the school team, and he led Holy Cross to 26 consecutive wins and second place in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) and became a three-time All-American.9
Boston Celtics
The first years (1950-56)
Cousy turned professional and made himself available for the 1950 NBA Draft at a time when the local Boston Celtics had just concluded the 1949-50 NBA season with a poor 22-46 win-loss record and had the first draft pick. It was strongly anticipated that they would draft the highly coveted local favorite Cousy. However, coach Red Auerbach snubbed him in favour of center Charlie Share, commenting: &quot;I'm supposed to win, not go after local yokels&quot;. The local press strongly criticised Auerbach,10 but other scouts were also sceptical about Cousy, viewing him as being flamboyant but ineffective. One scout wrote in his report: &quot;The first time he tries that fancy Dan stuff in this league, they'll cram the ball down his throat.&quot;11
As a result, the Tri-Cities Blackhawks drafted Cousy, but the point guard was unenthusiastic about his new employer. Cousy was trying to establish a driving school in Worcester, Massachusetts and did not want to move into a left field consisting of three small towns of Moline, Rock Island and Davenport. As compensation for having to give up his driving school, Cousy demanded a salary of $10,000 from Blackhawks owner Bob Kerner. When Kerner only offered him $6,000, Cousy refused to report.12 The latter was then picked up by the Chicago Stags, but when they folded, league Commissioner Maurice Podoloff declared three Stags available for a dispersal draft:Stags scoring champion Max Zaslofsky, Andy Phillip and Cousy.13 Walter A. Brown, owner of the Boston Celtics, was one of the three club bosses invited. He later made it clear that he was hoping for Zaslofsky, would have tolerated Phillip, and did not want Cousy. When the Celtics drew Cousy, Brown confessed: &quot;I could have fallen to the floor.&quot; Hence, Cousy became a Celtic, with Brown reluctantly giving him a $9,000 salary.14
It was not long before both Auerbach and Brown changed their minds. With an average of 15.6 points, 6.9 rebounds and 4.9 assists a game, Cousy received the first of his 13 consecutive All-NBA Team call-ups,15 and led a Celtics team with future Hall-of-Famer Ed Macauley and Bones McKinney to a 39-30 record in the 1950-51 NBA season. However, in the 1951 NBA Playoffs, the Celtics were beaten by the New York Knicks.16 The next year, the Celtics added future Hall-of-Fame guard Bill Sharman in the 1951 NBA Draft, and by averaging 21.7 points, 6.4 rebounds and 6.7 assists per game, Cousy earned his first All-NBA First Team nomination.17 Nonetheless, the Celtics stranded again against the Knicks in the 1952 NBA Playoffs.18
In the following season, Cousy made further progress. Averaging 7.7 assists per game, he won the first of his eight consecutive assists titles.19 These numbers were made despite the fact that the NBA had not yet introduced the shot clock, making the game static and putting prolific assist givers at a disadvantage.20 Powered by Auerbach's quick fastbreak-dominated tactics, the Celtics won 46 games and beat the Syracuse Nationals 2-0 in the 1953 NBA Playoffs. The second match ended 111-105 in a quadruple-overtime thriller, in which Cousy had a much-lauded game. Despite nursing an injured leg, he scored 25 points in regulation time, scored 6 of his team's 9 points in first overtime, hit a clutch free shot in the last seconds, and scored all four Celtics points in the second period of overtime. Cousy scored another 8 in the third, among them a 25-foot buzzer beater, and in the fourth overtime, he scored 9 of 12 Celtics points. Cousy ended the game playing 66 minutes, and scoring 50 points after making a still-standing record of 30 free throws in 32 attempts. This game is regarded by the NBA as one of the finest scoring feats ever, in line with Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game.21 However, for the third time in a row, the Knicks defeated the Celtics in the next round.22
In the next three years, Cousy firmly established himself as one of the best point guards of the league. Leading the league in assists again in all three seasons, and averaging 20 points and 7 rebounds, the versatile Cousy earned himself three further All-NBA First Team and All-Star honours, and was also Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the NBA All-Star game in 1954. 23 In terms of playing style, Cousy introduced an array of visually attractive street basketball moves, described by the NBA as a mix of ambidextrous, behind-the-back dribbling and &quot;no-look passes, behind-the-back feeds or half-court fastbreak launches&quot;.24 Cousy's modus operandi contrasted with the rest of the NBA, which was dominated by muscular low post scorers and deliberate flat-footed set shooters.25 Soon, he was called &quot;Houdini of the Hardwood&quot; after the magician Harry Houdini. Cousy's crowd-pleasing and effective play drew the crowd into the Boston Garden and also won over coach Auerbach, who no longer saw him as a liability, but as an essential building block for the future.26
The Celtics eventually added two talented forwards, namely future Hall-of-Famer Frank Ramsey and defensive specialist Jim Loscutoff. Along with Celtics colleague Bob Brannum, Loscutoff also became Cousy's unofficial bodyguard, retaliating against opposing players who would try to hurt him.27 The Celtics were unable to make their mark in the  1954,  1955 and 1956 NBA Playoffs, where they lost three times in a row against the Syracuse Nationals of Hall-of-fame forward Dolph Schayes.282930 Cousy attributed the shortcomings to fatigue, stating: &quot;We would get tired in the end and could not get the ball&quot;.31 As a result, Auerbach sought a defensive center who could both get easy rebounds, initiate fastbreaks and close out games.32
Dynasty years (1956-63)
In the 1956 NBA Draft, Auerbach acquired three future Hall-of-Famers: forward Tom Heinsohn, guard K.C. Jones and defensive center Bill Russell. Powered by these new recruits, the Celtics went 44-28 in the regular season,33 and Cousy averaged 20.6 points, 4.8 rebounds and a league-leading 7.5 assists, earning his first NBA Most Valuable Player Award; he also won his second NBA All-Star Game MVP award.34 The Celtics reached the 1957 NBA Finals, and powered by Cousy on offense and rugged center Russell on defense, they beat the Hawks 4-3, who were noted for future Hall-of-Fame power forward Bob Pettit and former teammates Macauley and Hagan. Cousy finally won his first title.35
In the 1957-58 NBA season, Cousy had yet another highly productive year, with his 20.0 points, 5.5 rebounds and 8.6 assists per game leading to nominations into the All-NBA First Team and the All-Star team. He again led the NBA in assists.36 The Celtics reached the 1958 NBA Finals against the Hawks, but when Russell succumbed to a foot injury in Game 3, the Celtics faded and bowed out 2-4. This was the last losing NBA playoff series in which Cousy would play.37
In the following 1958-59 NBA season, the Celtics took revenge on their opposition, powered by an inspired Cousy, who averaged 20.0 points, 5.5 rebounds and a league-high 8.6 assists a game, won yet another assists title and another pair of All-NBA First Team and All-Star team nominations.38 Late in the season, Cousy reasserted his playmaking dominance by setting an NBA record with 28 assists in a game against the Minneapolis Lakers. While this record was eventually broken some 19 years later, Cousy's 19 assists in a single half has never been surpassed. The Celtics stormed through the playoffs and, behind Cousy's 51 total assists (still a record for a four-game NBA Finals series), defeated the Minneapolis Lakers in the first 4-0 sweep ever in the NBA Finals.39
In the 1959-60 NBA season, Cousy was again productive, his 19.4 points, 4.7 rebounds and 9.5 assists per game earning him his eighth consecutive assists title and another joint All-NBA First Team and All-Star team nomination.40 Again, the Celtics defeated all opposition and won the 1960 NBA Finals 4-3 against the Hawks.41 A year later, the 32-year-old Cousy scored 18.1 points, 4.4 rebounds and 7.7 assists per game, winning another pair of All-NBA First Team and All-Star nominations, but failing to win the assists crown after eight consecutive seasons.42 However, the Celtics won the 1961 NBA Finals after convincingly beating the Hawks 4-1.43
In the 1961-62 NBA season, the aging Cousy slowly began to fade statistically, averaging 15.7 points, 3.5 rebounds and 7.8 assists, and was voted into the All-NBA Second Team after ten consecutive First Team nominations.44 Still, he enjoyed a satisfying post-season, winning the 1962 NBA Finals after two closely fought 4-3 battles against two upcoming teams, the Philadelphia Warriors of Wilt Chamberlain and then the Los Angeles Lakers of Hall-of-Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West. The Finals series against the Lakers was especially dramatic, because Lakers guard Frank Selvy failed to make a last-second buzzer beater shot in Game 7 which would have won the Los Angeles the title.45 Finally, in the last season of his career, Cousy averaged 13.2 points, 2.5 rebounds and 6.8 points, and collected one last All-Star and All-NBA Second Team nomination.46 In the 1963 NBA Finals, the Celtics again won 4-2 against the Lakers, and Cousy finished his career on a high note: in the fourth quarter of Game 6, Cousy sprained an ankle and had to be helped to the bench. He went back in with the Lakers ahead by a point. Although he did not score again, his was credited with providing an emotional lift that carried the Celtics to victory 112-109. The game ended with Cousy throwing the ball into the rafters.47
At age 35, Cousy ended his playing career. The farewell ceremony in a packed Boston Garden became known as the Boston Tear Party, when the veteran point guard was rendered speechless by a 20-minute speech that was only meant to be seven minutes long. Joe Dillon, a water worker and devoted Celtics fan screamed &quot;We love ya, Cooz&quot;, breaking the tension and the crowd went into cheers.48 As a testament to Cousy's legacy, President John F. Kennedy wired to Cousy: &quot;The game bears an indelible stamp of your rare skills and competitive daring.&quot;49
Post-player career
After retiring as a player, Cousy published his autobiography Basketball Is My Life in 1963, and in the same year, he became coach at  Boston College. In his six seasons there, he had a record of 117 wins and 38 losses and was named New England Coach of the Year for 1968 and 1969. Cousy led the Eagles to three NIT appearances including a berth at the 1969 NIT Championship and two National Collegiate Athletic Association tournaments including a berth at the 1967 Eastern Regional Finals.50 However, he grew bored wth college basketball and made his return to the NBA as coach of the Cincinnati Royals, team of fellow Hall-of-Fame point guard Oscar Robertson. He later said about this engagement: &quot;I did it for the money. I was made the offer I couldn't refuse.&quot;51 In 1970, the 41-year-old Cousy even made a late-season comeback as a player to boost ticket sales. Despite his meager output of a cumulated 5 points in 34 minutes of play time in seven games,52 ticket sales jumped by 77 percent.53 However, Cousy stepped down as coach early in the 1973-74 NBA season with a mediocre 141-209 record.54 In later life, Cousy was Commissioner of the American Soccer League from 1974 to 1979, and he has been a color analyst on Celtics telecasts since the 1980s.&quot;55 In addition, he had a cameo role in the basketball film Blue Chips in 1993. Today, he is a Marketing Consultant of the Celtics.56

The Boston Celtics retired the number-14 jersey with Bob Cousy's name.

Legacy
In his 13-year, 924-game NBA career, Cousy finished with 16,960 points, 4,786 rebounds and 6,955 assists, translating to averages of 18.4 points, 5.2 rebounds and 7.5 assists per game.57 He was regarded as the first great point guard of the NBA, winning eight of the first 11 assist titles in the league, all of them en bloc, and had a highly successful career, winning six NBA titles, one MVP award, 13 All-Star and 12 All-NBA First and Second Team call-ups and two All-Star MVP awards.58 With his eye-catching dribbling and unorthodox passing, Cousy popularised modern guard play and raised the profile of the Boston Celtics and the entire NBA.59 His fast-paced playing style was later emulated by the likes of Pete Maravich and Magic Johnson.60
In recognition of his feats, Cousy was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1971 and was honored by the Boston Celtics franchise which retired his number 14 jersey. Celtics owner Walter Brown said: &quot;The Celtics wouldn't be here without him [Cousy]. .he made basketball in this town. If he had played in New York he would have been the biggest thing since [New York Yankees baseball legend] Babe Ruth. I think he is anyway.&quot;61 In addition, on May 11, 2006, ESPN.com rated Cousy as the fifth greatest point guard of all time, lauding him as &quot;ahead of his time with his ballhandling and passing skills&quot; and pointing out he is only one of four point guards ever to win a NBA Most Valuable Player award.62
Personal life
Cousy was born as the son of Julliette and Joseph Cousy, two immigrants from France who settled down in New York in the midst of the Great Depression,63 where Joseph was a cab driver.64 The Cousys spoke nothing but French until Bob was five, and he grew up in modest surroundings. Cousy married his wife Missy, who has been his spouse for over 50 years. They live in Worcester, Massachusetts.65
Cousy was known for his anti-racist attitude, a result of his upbringing in a multicultural environment. In 1950, the Celtics played a match in the then-segregated city of Charlotte, North Carolina, and teammate Chuck Cooper &lt;U+2013&gt; the first African-American in NBA history to be drafted &lt;U+2013&gt; would have been denied a hotel room. Instead of taking the hotel room, Cousy insisted on travelling with Cooper on an uncomfortable overnight train. He described their visit of a segregated men's toilet &lt;U+2013&gt; Cooper was prohibited to use the clean &quot;for whites&quot; bathroom and had to use the shabby &quot;for colored&quot; facility &lt;U+2013&gt; as one of the most shameful experiences of his life.66 He also sympathized with the plight of black Celtics star Bill Russell, who was frequently a victim of racism.67 In addition, Cousy was close friends with his Celtics mentor Red Auerbach and was one of the few people who could call him &quot;Arnold&quot; (his real first name) instead of &quot;Mr. Auerbach&quot;.68
