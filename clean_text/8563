STREETS International, is a New York based U.S. 501(c)(3), non-profit corporation, founded to provide culinary and hospitality training for street kids, orphans and other disadvantaged youth across South East Asia.1 STREETS International is a self sustaining initiative with all the revenues from the STREETS Restaurant Caf&lt;U+00E9&gt; going to support the program.2
Program
STREETS was established in 2007 and opened it&lt;U+2019&gt;s Hoi An Restaurant Caf&lt;U+00E9&gt; in 2009. It provides a comprehensive an 18-month training program that follows a curriculum developed in conjunction with the Institute of Culinary Education in New York.3 Graduates finish the program with an international certificate in the hospitality and culinary fields.4 The program provides the necessary daily living support for participants -- called &lt;U+2018&gt;Trainees.&lt;U+2019&gt; This includes supervised housing, food, financial support and basic medical care. Trainees are selected from throughout Vietnam; program participants typically are orphaned or come from extreme poverty, including those that have been trafficked or are part of the often overlooked ethnic minority groups.5
STREETS&lt;U+2019&gt; goal is to match the needs of disadvantaged youth with the opportunities in growing tourism economies, by providing job training, English language instruction and life skills education.
