The Heart of a Goof is a collection of nine short stories by English comic writer P. G. Wodehouse. It was first published in the UK on April 15 1926 by Herbert Jenkins, and in the U.S. on March 4 1927 by George H. Doran, New York, under the title Divots.
The stories all concern golf, and are told by the Oldest Member; the book can be considered a sequel to his first similar collection, The Clicking of Cuthbert (1922). The dedication is typically Wodehousian, reading &quot;To my daughter Leonora without whose never-failing sympathy and encouragement this book would have been finished in half the time&quot;.
