Fire
In October 2004, one of Roving Enterprises production offices in Abbotsford, a Melbourne suburb, was destroyed by a large fire that caused nearly $1 million damage and required 16 fire engines and over 50 firefighters to extinguish it. The offices were used for production, graphics editing and wardrobe/props and among the many things lost, the fire destroyed pieces that were to be used for the 2004 ARIA Music Awards ceremony. The company also lost valuable editing equipment, computers and irreplaceable video tapes and digital footage. 3
