Reception
A total of 775 people attended the event.38 Canadian Online Explorer writer Jason Clevett felt the event was the &quot;most entertaining pay per view from TNA since January's Final Resolution.&quot; Clevett rated the main event, the X Division Championship match, and the Clockwork Orange House of Fun match each an 8 out of 10. The Gauntlet for the Gold and the NWA World Tag Team Championship defense were each rated a 7 out of 10.39 Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch rated the main event and the Clockwork Orange House of Fun match 3 and a fourth stars out of 5. Regrading the main event, Keller felt it was a &quot;PPV main event worthy match, the best of the night, but when a 20 minute Styles main event PPV match isn't four stars, it's not Styles's fault.&quot; As for the Clockwork Orange House of Fun match, Keller felt it was a &quot;good garbage match&quot; and that Waltman was a &quot;suitable substitution for the Hardy no-show.&quot; Keller rated the Gauntlet for the Gold and the X Division Championship match each 2 and three-quarter stars out of 5. He stated that the Gauntlet for the Gold was &quot;above-average&quot;, but that it felt &quot;clogged with undersized wrestlers who didn't look like legit contenders, exposing TNA's roster depth limitations in the heavyweight division.&quot; While reporting on the X Division Championship bout, that it &quot;never felt special, but it was always good.&quot;40 TNA released a DVD counting down the top 50 moments in their history in 2007, with Styles defeating Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at number 7.41
