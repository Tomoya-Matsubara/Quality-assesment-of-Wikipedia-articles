The Gastambide-Mengin monoplane later Gastambide-Mengin I, Gastambide-Mengin II and Antoinette II was an early France French experimental aircraft designed by Leon Levavasseur and was the first aircraft built by the Antoinette manufacturer Antoinette company. The name came from Jules Gastambide who financed the company and Gabriel Mengin the aircraft engineer.

Design and development
The monoplane later known as the Gastambide-Mengin I was powered by a convert 50 hp kW 0 abbr=on Antoinette manufacturer Antoinette piston engine driving a tractor propeller. It was noted for having a complex quadricycle landing gear. The monoplane made four flights between 8 and 14 February 1908 flown by a mechanic named Boyer, the furthest being a flight of 150m. After these flights the aircraft was rebuilt between February and August 1908 as the Gastambide-Mengin II later named the Antoinette II, the modifications included revised triangular ailerons. The modified aircraft made three short flights in August 1908, one of these on 21 August 1908 was the first circle flown by a monoplane and on a flight the previous day 20 August 1908 Robert Gastambride became the first passenger flown in a monoplane. With lessons learnt from the design Levavassuer went on to design a family of monoplanes names after Antoinette Gastambide the daughter of Jules Gastambide.
