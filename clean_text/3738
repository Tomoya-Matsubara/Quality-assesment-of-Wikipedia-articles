Thomas Foley (c.1670 &lt;U+2013&gt; 10 December 1737) held the sinecure office of auditor of the imprests. He was the eldest son of Paul Foley, Speaker of the House of Commons and ironmaster, and succeeded to his estates around Stoke Edith, Herefordshire on his father's death in 1699.
Thomas Foley was Member of Parliament for Hereford from 1700 to 1722 and for Stafford from 1722 to 1727 and again from 1734 until his death. Throughout this period, he was the leading ironmaster in the Forest of Dean. Initially this business was managed by John Wheeler and then by William Rea, until Rea was sacked in 1725. From that time the number of ironworks operated by his business, latterly without outside partners gradually declined.
He and his wife Anne, daughter and heir of Essex Knightley of Fawsley, Northamptonshire had one son Thomas Foley (c 1695-1749), and two daughters.
