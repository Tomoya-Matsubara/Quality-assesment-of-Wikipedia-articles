Pallada Russian: ' was the last of the four sclass Bayan cruiser 0 armored cruisers built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the late 1900s. She was assigned to the Baltic Fleet during World War I where she captured codebooks from the German cruiser SMS Magdeburg  2 that had run aground during the first month of the war. The ship was torpedoed by a German submarine in October 1914 and exploded; none of the crew survived. Pallada was the first warship lost by the Russians during the war.

Design and description
Pallada was convert 449.6 ft 1 long length overall overall. She had a maximum beam nautical beam of convert 57.5 ft 1, a Draft hull draught of convert 26 ft 1 and displaced convert 7750 LT t. The ship had a crew of 568 officers and men. Pallada was named in honour of the Russian cruiser Pallada 1899 earlier Russian cruiser captured by the Japanese during the Russo-Japanese War.McLaughlin, p. 75 Both ships were named for the Greek goddess, Pallas Athena.

The ship had two Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion vertical triple-expansion steam engines with a designed total of convert 16500 ihp kW lk=in 0, but they developed convert 19320 ihp kW lk=in on sea trials and drove the ship to a maximum speed of convert 22.55 kn lk=in. Steam for the engines was provided by 26 Belleville boilers. She could carry a maximum of convert 1100 LT t 0 of coal, although her range is unknown.

Pallada's main armament consisted of two convert 8 in adj=on 0 45-caliber artillery calibre guns in single gun turret turrets fore and aft. Her eight convert 6 in adj=on 0 gun were mounted in casemates on the sides of the ship's hull.Watts, p. 100 Anti-torpedo boat defense was provided by 20 convert 75 mm adj=on 50-calibre guns; eight of these were mounted in casemates on the side of the hull and in the superstructure. The remaining guns were located above the six-inch gun casemates in pivot mounts with gun shields. Pallada also mounted four convert 47 mm in adj=on Hotchkiss guns. The ship also had two submerged convert 15 in adj=on 0 torpedo tubes, one mounted on each broadside.McLaughlin, pp. 68, 75

The ship used Krupp armour throughout. Her Belt armor waterline belt was convert 190 mm 1 thick over her machinery spaces. Fore and aft, it reduced to convert 90 mm 1. The upper belt and the casemates were convert 60 mm 1 thick. The armour deck ship deck was convert 50 mm 0 thick; over the central Artillery battery#Naval usage battery it was a single plate, but elsewhere it consisted of a convert 30 mm adj=on plate over two convert 10 mm adj=on plates. The gun turrets were protected by convert 132 mm of armour and  the conning tower had walls convert 136 mm thick.McLaughlin, p. 68

Service
Pallada was built by the Admiralty Shipyard in Saint Petersburg. Construction began on 24 June 1905,McLaughlin, p. 73 although she was not formally laid down until August, and the ship was Ship naming and launching launched on 10 November 1906. Pallada was completed in February 1911.Watts, p. 99 She spent her entire career with the Baltic Fleet.McLaughlin, p. 78

On 26 August 1914, during the first month of World War I, the German light cruiser Magdeburg ran aground near the island of Osmussaar Odensholm in the Gulf of Finland. Her escort, the destroyer ship German destroyer V-26  2, failed to pull her off and rescued part of the crew before Pallada and the protected cruiser ship Russian cruiser Bogatyr  2 appeared and opened fire. The Germans blew up the front part of the ship, but failed to demolish the rest of the ship. They failed to destroy their naval codebooks, which were discovered by the Russians. A copy was later given to the British where it proved enormously helpful in reading German wireless traffic. Together with the armoured cruiser ship Russian cruiser Rurik 1906 2, Pallada unsuccessfully searched for German ships between Bornholm and Danzig on the night of 27 August. Less than two months later, on 11 October, she was torpedoed by the German submarine SM U-26 U-26 and blew up with the loss of all hands, the first Russian warship sunk during the war.Halperin, pp. 3637, 18485
