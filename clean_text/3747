Backstory
BuzzSaw is themed around a series of unexplainable occurrences in the Town of Gold Rush which date back to the late 1800s.26 In 1876, the Town of Gold Rush was formed. It was a prosperous town during the great gold rush. After the gold ran out in 1887, they established a sawmill and turned their focus to timber. On a clear moon-lit night, a sawmill worker named Jack Darke was killed by the buzz saw after he had a scuffle with some other workers who were attempting to set the building on fire. The circumstances leading up to his death were covered up by the town with the legend stating that Jack tried to burn down the sawmill and slipped into the path of the buzz saw.27 The sawmill has remained closed since28 with many people claiming encounters with the ghost of Jack on nights similar to that of his death.29
Entrance and station
The entrance to BuzzSaw is located in the Town of Gold Rush where the Helicopter Joy Flights used to operate,30 opposite the former entrance of the Eureka Mountain Mine Ride.3132 The station is themed to the abandoned sawmill in the town of Gold Rush and tells the story of Jack Darke.33 Within the building, guests are directed through a series of queue switchbacks and pathways. Several television screens are embedded in the walls and show burning timber. Parts of the theming are caged off with crime scene signs. Throughout the queue, guests are able to hear the sound of buzzsaws as well as several warnings to not go any further and to escape while they can.34 Large circular saws (a.k.a. buzzsaws) are located on the side and roof of the building.35
Ride
BuzzSaw is a steel, Maurer S&lt;U+00F6&gt;hne SkyLoop XT 150 roller coaster.3637 As part of Maurer S&lt;U+00F6&gt;hne's X-Coaster range of roller coasters, the SkyLoop begins with a vertical chain lift hill to a height of .38 At the top of this lift hill, the car is pulled slowly back over on itself before it is released into a full heartline roll and a drop down a steep hill back towards the station. The train then oscillates between the two hills before it is caught by the chain hill and slowly lowered back down into the station.3940414243 A single ride on BuzzSaw is completed in approximately 50 seconds.44
Reception
The reception of BuzzSaw has been generally positive. Melinda Siegmeier of the Gold Coast Bulletin stated &quot;the scream machine is certainly a fitting way to describe Dreamworld's newest thrill ride the BuzzSaw&quot;.45 Siegmeier also commented on the vertical lift hill: &quot;by this stage I was certainly wishing I was back on the ground&quot;.46 Ardent Leisure, the owners of Dreamworld, have claimed the launch of the ride to be a success.47 In the first year of operation, over 435,000 people rode the attraction.48 However, in the worldwide Best Roller Coaster Poll in 2012, BuzzSaw (along with other identical SkyLoop rides) ranked 221 out of 365.49
