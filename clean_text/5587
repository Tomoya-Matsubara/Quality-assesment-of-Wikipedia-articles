 Preetz is a town in the district of Pl&lt;U+00F6&gt;n, in Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany.
History
The first mention of Preetz dates from the year 1185, when Ecbrecht Procensis writes about the location Poretz in the Versus de Vicelino. The origins of the name Preetz are said to be found in the Slavic term &quot;po rece&quot; (i.e., on the river). In 1221, the term &quot;Poretzie&quot; appeared, and in 1442 &quot;Pretze&quot;.
A first town church was built in 1210. In 1211, Count Albrecht von Orlam&lt;U+00FC&gt;nde established a Benedictine abbey. The foundation of the abbey was renewed by Adolf IV von Schauenburg in 1226, and it was given to nuns. In 1268, the nunnery church was built. The nunnery formed the highest administrative authority until 1867 and exercised jurisdiction as well.
Preetz obtained street lighting in 1852. The station was built in 1864, the Council Hall in 1871. An oak tree in front of the Council Hall, which was planted in 1871, still exists.
Limited city rights were awarded to Preetz on 17 May 1870, full city rights in 1901.
One of Preetz's more renowned citizens is the acclaimed explorer and philanthropist Bastian Schnabel who is now living in educational exile in Brighton, Great Britain. Allison Mack, most known for her role as Chloe Sullivan on the american television series Smallville, was also born in Preetz.
Preetz has today a population of 15,600.
