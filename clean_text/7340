English is a West Germanic languages West Germanic language that was first spoken in Anglo-Saxon England early medieval England and is now a global lingua franca.sfn Crystal 2003a p=6sfn Wardhaugh 2010 p=55 It is an official language of list of territorial entities where English is an official language almost 60 sovereign states, the most commonly spoken language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Republic of Ireland Ireland, and New Zealand, and a widely spoken language in countries in the Caribbean, Africa, and southeast Asia.sfn Crystal 2003b pp=108109 It is the List of languages by number of native speakers third most common native language in the world, after Standard Chinese Mandarin and Spanish language Spanish.sfn Ethnologue 2010 It is widely learned as a second language and is an Official languages of the United Nations official language of the United Nations, of Languages of the European Union the European Union, and of many other world and regional international organisations.

English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English, a set of Anglo-Frisian languages Anglo-Frisian dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxons Anglo-Saxon settlers in the fifth century, are called Old English. Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England.sfn Crystal 2003b p=30 Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London and the Great Vowel Shift. Through the worldwide influence of the British Empire, Modern English spread around the world from the 17th to mid-20th centuries. Through newspapers, books, the telegraph, the telephone, phonograph records, radio, satellite television, and the Internet, as well as the emergence of the United States as a global superpower, English has become the World language leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and in professional contexts such as science.

There is little morphological inflection in Modern English, and the syntax is generally isolating. English relies on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives and negation. Despite noticeable variation between the forms of English spoken in different world regions, English-speakers from around the world can communicate with one another effectively. Different accents are distinguished only by phonological differences from the standard language, whereas dialects also display grammatical and lexical differences.

Classification

English is an Indo-European languages Indo-European language, and belongs to the West Germanic languages West Germanic group of the Germanic languages.sfn Bammesberger 1992 pp=2930 Most closely related to English are the Frisian languages, and English and Frisian form the Anglo-Frisian languages Anglo-Frisian subgroup within West Germanic. Modern English descends from Middle English, which in turn descends from Old English.sfn Robinson 1992 English and all the Germanic languages descend from Proto-Germanic language Proto-Germanic. Sometimes Anglo-Frisian is grouped with Old Saxon and its descendent Low German languages, as a group labelled Ingvaeonic languages Ingvaeonic or North Sea Germanic.sfn Bammesberger 1992 p=30 Middle English also developed into a number of other English languages, including Scots language Scotssfn Romaine 1982 pp=5665 and the extinct Fingallian and Forth and Bargy dialects of Ireland.sfn Barry 1982 pp=8687

English is classified as a Germanic language because it shares new language features different from other Indo-European languages with other Germanic languages such as Dutch language Dutch, German language German, and Swedish language Swedish.sfn Durrell 2006 These shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor, which linguists call Proto-Germanic. Some shared features of Germanic languages are the use of modal verbs, the division of verbs into Germanic strong verb strong and Germanic weak verb weak classes, and the sound changes affecting Proto-Indo-European language Proto-Indo-European consonants, known as Grimm's law Grimm's and Verner's laws. Through Grimm's law, the word for foot begins with IPA /f/ in Germanic languages, but its cognates in other Indo-European languages begin with IPA /p/. English is classified as an Anglo-Frisian language because Frisian and English share other features, such as the palatalization sound change palatalisation of consonants that were velar consonants in Proto-Germanic.sfn Knig van der Auwera 1994

English, like the other insular Germanic languages, Icelandic language Icelandic and Faroese language Faroese, developed independently of the continental Germanic languages and their influences. English is thus not Mutual intelligibility mutually intelligible with any continental Germanic language, differing in lexis linguistics vocabulary, syntax, and phonology, although some, such as Dutch, do show strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages.sfn Harbert 2007

Because English through its history has changed considerably in response to contact with other languages, particularly Old Norse and Norman language Norman French, some scholars have argued that English can be considered a mixed language or a Creole language creole&nbsp; a theory called the Middle English creole hypothesis. Although the high degree of influence from these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language.sfn Thomason Kaufman 1988 pp=264265sfn Watts 2011 loc=Chapter 4

main Old English
The earliest form of English is called Old English or Anglo-Saxon c.&nbsp;5501066&nbsp;CE. Old English developed from a set of Ingvaeonic languages North Sea Germanic dialects originally spoken along the coasts of Frisia, Lower Saxony, Jutland, and Southern Sweden by Germanic tribes known as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. In the fifth century, the Anglo-Saxons Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain settled Britain and End of Roman rule in Britain the Romans withdrew from Britain. By the seventh century, the Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in Britain, replacing the languages of Roman Britain 43409 CE: Common Brittonic, a Celtic languages Celtic language, and Latin, brought to Britain by the Caesar's invasions of Britain Roman occupation.sfn Collingwood Myres 1936sfn Graddol Leith Swann et al. 2007sfn Blench Spriggs 1999 England and English  originally Anglaland and Englisc are named after the Angles.sfn Bosworth Toller 1921

Old English was divided into four dialects: the Anglian dialects, Mercian dialect Mercian and Northumbrian dialect Northumbrian, and the Saxon dialects, Kentish dialect Kentish and West Saxon dialect West Saxon.sfn Campbell 1959 p=4 Through the educational reforms of Alfred the Great King Alfred in the ninth century and the influence of the kingdom of Wessex, the West Saxon dialect became the standard language standard written variety.sfn Toon 1992 loc=Chapter: Old English Dialects The epic poetry epic poem Beowulf is written in West Saxon, and the earliest English poem, Cdmon's Hymn, is written in Northumbrian.sfn Donoghue 2008 Modern English developed mainly from Mercian, but the Scots language developed from Northumbrian. A few short inscriptions from the early period of Old English were written using a Anglo-Saxon runes runic script.sfn Gneuss  2013 p=23 By the sixth century, a Old English Latin alphabet Latin alphabet was adopted, written with Uncial script#Half-uncial half-uncial letterforms. It included the runic letters wynn lang ang   and Thorn letter thorn lang ang  , and the modified Latin letters eth lang ang  , and  ash lang ang  .sfn Gneuss  2013 p=23sfn Denison Hogg 2006 pp=3031

Old English is very different from Modern English and difficult for 21st-century English speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern German language German. Old English grammar Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs had many more Inflection#Inflectional morphology inflectional endings and forms, and word order was Word order#Pragmatic word order much freer than in Modern English. Modern English has grammatical case case forms in pronouns he, him, his and a few verb endings I have, he has, but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more grammatical person person and grammatical number number endings.sfn Hogg 1992 loc=Chapter=Phonology and Morphologysfn Smith 2009sfn Trask Trask 2010

The translation of Matthew 8:20 from 1000&nbsp;CE shows examples of case endings nominative case nominative plural, accusative case accusative plural, genitive case genitive singular and a verb ending present tense present plural:

 source= John of Trevisa, ca. 1385sfn Hogg 2006 pp=360361

In the period from the 8th to the 12th century, Old English gradually transformed through language contact into Middle English. Middle English is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the Norman conquest of England conquest of England by William the Conqueror in 1066, but it developed further in the period from 12001450.

First, the waves of Norse colonisation of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with Old Norse, a North Germanic language. Norse influence was strongest in the Northeastern varieties of Old English spoken in the Danelaw area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation; today these features are still particularly present in Scots language Scots and Northern England English Northern English. However the centre of norsified English seems to have been in the Midlands around Kingdom of Lindsey Lindsey, and after 920 CE when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity, Norse features spread from there into English varieties that had not been in intense contact with Norse speakers. Some elements of Norse influence that persist in all English varieties today are the pronouns beginning with th- they, them, their which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with h- hie, him, hera.sfn Thomason Kaufman 1988 pp=284290

With the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the now norsified Old English language was subject to contact with the Old Norman language, a Romance language closely related to Modern French language French. The Norman language in England eventually developed into Anglo-Norman language Anglo-Norman. Because Norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles, while the lower classes continued speaking Anglo-Saxon, the influence of Norman consisted of introducing a wide range of loanwords related to politics, legislation and prestigious social domains.sfn Svartvik Leech 2006 p=39 Middle English also simplified the inflectional system. The distinction between nominative and accusative case was lost except in personal pronouns, the instrumental case was dropped, and the use of the genitive case was limited to describing Possession linguistics possession. The inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms,sfn Lass 1992 and gradually simplified the system of agreement, making word order less flexible.sfn Fischer van der Wurff 2006 pages=11113 By the 1380s the Wycliffe Bible the passage Matthew 8:20 was written

:Foxis han dennes, and briddis of heuene han nestiscite web  last = Wycliffe   first = John   author-mask = 3   url=http://wesley.nnu.edu/fileadmin/imported_site/wycliffe/wycbible-all.pdf   publisher = Wesley NNU   title = Bible

Here the plural suffix -n on the verb have is still retained, but none of the case endings on the nouns are present.

By the 12th century Middle English was fully developed, integrating both Norse and Norman features; it continued to be spoken until the transition to early Modern English around 1500. Middle English literature includes Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, and Thomas Malory Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. In the Middle English period the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated, and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as Chaucer.

Early Modern English
main Early Modern English
File:Great Vowel Shift2a.svg right 300px thumb Graphic representation of the Great Vowel Shift, showing how the pronunciation of the long vowels gradually shifted, with the high vowels i: and u: breaking into diphthongs and the lower vowels each shifting their pronunciation up one level.
The next period in the history of English was Early Modern English 15001700. Early Modern English was characterised by the Great Vowel Shift 13501700, inflectional simplification, and linguistic standardisation.

The Great Vowel Shift affected the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a chain shift, meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system. Mid vowel Mid and open vowels were raising phonology raised, and close vowels were vowel breaking broken into diphthongs. For example the word bite was originally pronounced as the word beet is today, and the second vowel in the word about was pronounced as the word boot is today. The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling, since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.sfn Lass 2000sfn Grlach 1991 pp=6670

English began to rise in prestige during the reign of Henry V of England Henry V. Around 1430, the Court of Chancery in Westminster began using English in its writ official documents, and a new standard form of Middle English, known as Middle English#Chancery Standard Chancery Standard, developed from the dialects of London and the East Midlands English East Midlands. In 1476, William Caxton introduced the printing press to England and began publishing the first printed books in London, expanding the influence of this form of English.sfn Nevalainen Tieken-Boon van Ostade 2006 pages=27479 Literature from the Early Modern period includes the works of William Shakespeare and the King James Version translation of the Bible commissioned by James VI and I King James I. Even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from Modern English: for example, the consonant clusters IPA /kn gn sw/ in knight, gnat, and sword were still pronounced. Many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of Shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of Early Modern English.sfn Cercignani 1981

In the 1611 King James Version of the Bible, written in Early Modern English, Matthew 8:20 says:
:The Foxes haue holes and the birds of the ayre haue nestssfn Lass 2006 pp=4647

This exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure replacement with Subject-Verb-Object word order, and the use of of instead of the non-possessive genitive, and the introduction of loanwords from French ayre and word replacements bird originally meaning nestling had replaced OE fugol.

Spread of Modern English

In the late 18th century the Thirteen Colonies in North America became the first parts of the British empire to achieve independence, and the subsequent period saw English become a global, pluricentric language. As England continued to form new colonies, these in turn became independent and developed their own norms for how to speak and write the language. English was adopted in North America, India, parts of Africa, Australasia, and many other regions. In the post-colonial period, some of the newly created nations that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others.sfn Romaine 2006 p=586sfn Mufwene 2006 p=614sfn Northrup 2013 pp=8186 In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and its status as a global superpower since the Second World War have significantly accelerated the spread of the language across the planet.sfn Graddol 2006sfn Crystal2003a By the 21st century, English was more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.sfn McCrum MacNeil Cran 2003 pp=910

A major feature in the early development of Modern English was the codification of explicit norms for standard usage, and their dissemination through official media such as public education and state sponsored publications. In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his A Dictionary of the English Language which introduced a standard set of spelling conventions and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the Webster's Dictionary American Dictionary of the English language in an effort to establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent from the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.sfn Romaine 1999 pp=156

In terms of grammatical evolution, Modern English has now reached a stage where the loss of case is almost complete case is now only found in pronouns, such as he and him, she and her, who and whom, and where SVO word-order is mostly fixed.sfn Romaine 1999 pp=156 Some changes, such as the use of do-support have become universalised. Earlier English did not use the word do as a general auxiliary as Modern English does; at first it was only used in question constructions where it was not obligatory.sfn Romaine 1999 p=2 quote=Other changes such as the spread and regularisation of do support began in the thirteenth century and were more or less complete in the nineteenth. Although do coexisted with the simple verb forms in negative statements from the early ninth century, obligatoriness was not complete until the nineteenth. The increasing use of do periphrasis coincides with the fixing of SVO word order. Not surprisingly, do is first widely used in interrogatives, where the word order is disrupted, and then later spread to negatives. Now, do-support with the verb have is becoming increasingly standardised. The use of progressive forms in -ing, appears to be spreading to new constructions, and forms such as had been being built are becoming more common. Regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues e.g. dreamed instead of dreamt, and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common e.g. more polite instead of politer. British English is also undergoing change under the influence of American English, fuelled by the strong presence of American English in the media and the prestige associated with the US as a world power. sfn Leech Hundt Mair Smith 2009 pp=1819sfn Mair Leech 2006sfn Mair 2006

As of 2010 359&nbsp;million people spoke English as their first language. English is probably the third largest language by number of native speakers, after Standard Chinese Mandarin and Spanish language Spanish.sfn Ethnologue 2010 However, when combining native and non-native speakers it is probably the most commonly spoken language in the world.sfn McCrum MacNeil Cran 2003 pp=910sfn Crystal 2003a p=69 English is spoken by communities on every continent and on oceanic islands in all the major oceans.sfn Crystal 2003b p=106 The countries in which English is spoken can be grouped into different categories by how English is used in each country. The inner circlesfn Svartvik Leech 2006 p=2 countries with many native speakers of English share an international standard of written English and jointly influence speech norms of English around the world. English does not belong to just one country, and it does not belong solely to descendants of English settlers. English is an official language of countries populated by few descendants of native speakers of English. It has also become by far the most important language of international communication when people who share no common language meet anywhere in the world.

Three circles of English-speaking countries

Braj Kachru distinguishes countries where English is spoken with a World Englishes#Kachru.27s Three Circles of English three circles model.sfn Svartvik Leech 2006 p=2 In his model, the inner circle countries are countries with large communities of native speakers of English, outer circle countries have small communities of native speakers of English but widespread use of English as a second language for education or broadcasting or local official purposes, and expanding circle countries are countries where many learners learn English as a foreign language. Kachru bases his model on the history of how English spread in different countries, how users acquire English, and the range of uses English has in each country. The three circles change membership over time.sfn Kachru 2006 p=196

Countries with large communities of native speakers of English include the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, all countries with an English-speaking majority, and South Africa, where English is a significant minority language. The countries with the highest populations of native English speakers are, in descending order, the United States at least 231&nbsp;million,sfn Ryan 2013 loc=Table 1 the United Kingdom 60&nbsp;million,sfn Office for National Statistics 2013 loc=Key Pointssfn National Records of Scotland 2013sfn Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency 2012 loc=Table KS207NI: Main Language Canada 19&nbsp;million,sfn Statistics Canada 2014 Australia at least 17&nbsp;million,sfn Australian Bureau of Statistics 2013 South Africa 4.8&nbsp;million,sfn Statistics South Africa 2012 loc=Table 2.5 Population by first language spoken and province number Ireland 4.2&nbsp;million, and New Zealand 3.7&nbsp;million.sfn Statistics New Zealand 2014 English spreads to new speakers in such countries as children grow up in English-speaking homes and as local people who speak other languages or new immigrants learn English to communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces. The English in these countries develops in the typical pattern of learning by children from parents of both grammar and vocabulary.sfn Bao 2006 p=377 These inner-circle countries provide the base from which English can spread everywhere else in the world.sfn Kachru 2006 p=196

Estimates of the number of English speakers who are second language and foreign-language speakers vary greatly from 470&nbsp;million to more than 1,000 million depending on how proficiency is defined.sfn Crystal 2003b pp=108109 Linguist David Crystal estimates that non-native speakers now outnumber native speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1.sfn Crystal 2003a p=69 In Kachru's three-circles model, the outer circle countries are countries such as the Philippines,sfn Rubino 2006 Jamaica,sfn Patrick 2006a India, Pakistan, Singapore,sfn Lim Ansaldo 2006 and Nigeriasfn Connell 2006sfn Schneider 2007 with a much smaller proportion of native speakers of English but much use of English as a second language for education, government, or domestic business, where English is routinely used for school instruction and official interactions with the government.sfn Trudgill Hannah 2008 p=5 Those countries have millions of native speakers of dialect continuum dialect continua ranging from an English-based creole languages English-based creole to a more standard version of English. They have many more speakers of English who acquire English in the process of growing up through day by day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by speakers who are not native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners.sfn Bao 2006 p=377 Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries,sfn Bao 2006 p=377 and they may have grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.sfn Bao 2006 p=377

In the three-circles model, countries such as Poland, China, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries where English is taught as a foreign language make up the expanding circle.sfn Trudgill Hannah 2008 p=4 The distinctions between English as a first language, as a second language, and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over time.sfn Trudgill Hannah 2008 p=5 English is unusual among world languages in how many of its users are not native speakers but speakers of English as a second or foreign language.sfn Kachru 2006 p=197 Many users of English in the expanding circle use it to communicate with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use English.sfn Kachru 2006 p=198 Non-native varieties of English are widely used for international communication, and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties.sfn Bao 2006 Very often today a conversation in English anywhere in the world may include no native speakers of English at all, even while including speakers from several different countries.sfn Trudgill Hannah 2008 p=7

As decolonisation proceeded throughout the British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language policies.sfn Mufwene 2006 p=614sfn Mesthrie 2010 p=594sfn Northrup 2013 pp=8186 For example the view of the Indian English English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India.sfn Annamalai 2006 English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK.sfn Sailaja 2009 pages=29 David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than any other country in the world,sfn Crystal 2004b but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.sfn Graddol 2010

Modern English, sometimes described as the first global lingua franca,sfn Meierkord 2006 p=165sfn Graddol 2006 is also regarded as the first world language.sfn Brutt-Griffler 2006 p=69091sfn Northrup 2013 English is the world's most widely used language in newspaper publishing, book publishing, international telecommunications, scientific publishing, international trade, mass entertainment, and diplomacy.sfn Northrup 2013 English is, by international treaty, the basis for the required controlled natural languagessfn Wojcik 2006 p=139 Seaspeak and Airspeak used as international auxiliary language international languages of seafaringsfn International Maritime Organization 2011 and aviation.sfn International Civil Aviation Organization 2011 English has replaced German as the dominant language of scientific research.sfn Gordin 2015 It achieved parity with French language French as a language of diplomacy at the Treaty of Versailles negotiations in 1919.sfn Phillipson 2004 p=47 By the time of the foundation of the United Nations after World War II, English had become pre-eminentsfn ConradRubal-Lopez 1996 p=261 and is now the main worldwide language of diplomacy and international relations.sfn Richter 2012 p=29 It is one of six official languages of the United Nations.sfn United Nations 2008 Many other worldwide international organisations, including the International Olympic Committee, specify English as a working language or official language of the organisation.

Many regional international organisations such as the European Free Trade Association, Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN,sfn Crystal 2003a and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation APEC set English as the organisation's sole working language even though most or all of the member countries are not countries with a majority of native speakers of English. While the European Union EU allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the Union, in practice English is the main working language of EU organisations.sfn Ammon 2006 p=321

Although in most countries English is not an official language, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language.sfn Graddol 2006sfn Crystal 2003a In the countries of the EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where it is not an official language that is, the countries other than the UK and Ireland. In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll, 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well enough to have a conversation in that language. The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland, could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.sfn European Commission 2012 pp=21, 19

A working knowledge of English has become a requirement in a number of occupations and professions such as medicinesfn Alcaraz Ariza Navarro 2006 and computing. English has become so important in scientific publishing that more than 80 percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by Chemical Abstracts in 1998 were written in English, as were 90 percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996 and 82 percent of articles in humanities publications by 1995.sfn Brutt-Griffler 2006 p=69495

This increasing use of the English language globally has had a great impact on many other languages, leading to a great many English words being borrowed into the vocabularies of other languages. This influence from English has led to concerns about language death,sfn Crystal 2002 and to claims of linguistic imperialism,sfn Jambor 2007 and has prompted resistance to the spread of English. But the number of speakers of English continues to increase because many learners around the world think that English provides them with opportunity for better employment and improved lives.sfn Svartvik Leech 2006 loc=Chapter 12: English into the Future

Although some scholars mention a possibility of future divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages, most think a more likely outcome is that English will continue to function as a Koin language koineised language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world.sfn Crystal 2006 English is used as a language of wider communication in countries around the world.sfn Brutt-Griffler 2006 Thus English has grown in worldwide use much more than any constructed language proposed as an international auxiliary language, including Esperanto.sfn Li 2003sfn Meierkord 2006 p=163

Phonology
Main English phonology
The phonetics and phonology of English differ between dialects, usually without interfering with mutual communication. Phonological variation affects the inventory of phonemes speech sounds that distinguish meaning, and phonetic variation is differences in pronunciation of the phonemes.sfn Wolfram 2006 pp=334335 This overview mainly describes the standard language standard pronunciations of the United Kingdom and the United States: Received Pronunciation RP and General American GA See English language#Dialects.2C accents.2C and varieties Section below on Dialects, accents and varieties.

In the table, when obstruents stops, affricates, and fricatives appear in pairs, such as IPA /p b/, IPA /t d/, and IPA /s z/, the first is fortis and lenis fortis strong and the second is lenis weak. Fortis obstruents, such as IPA /p t s/ are pronounced with more muscular tension and breath force than lenis consonants, such as IPA /b d z/, and are always voicelessness voiceless. Lenis consonants are partly voice phonetics voiced at the beginning and end of utterances, and fully voiced between vowels. Fortis stops such as IPA /p/ have additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects: they are aspirated consonant aspirated IPA p when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed syllable, often unaspirated in other cases, and often unreleased IPA p&nbsp; or pre-glottalised IPA p at the end of a syllable. In a single-syllable word, a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened: thus nip has a noticeably shorter vowel phonetically, but not phonemically than nib IPA np #Vowels see below.sfn Collins Mees 2003 pages=4753
 lenis stops: bin IPA bn, about IPA bat, nib IPA nb
 fortis stops: pin IPA pn, spin IPA spn, happy IPA hpi, nip IPA nip&nbsp; or IPA nip

Vowels
main English phonology#Vowels
The pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speaker's accent. The table below lists the vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation RP and General American GA, with examples of words in which they occur from lexical sets compiled by linguists. The vowels are represented with symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet; those given for RP are standard in British dictionaries and other publications.

In RP, vowel length is phonemic; vowel length long vowels are marked with a Colon punctuation#International Phonetic Alphabet triangular colon angbr IPA  in the table above, such as the vowel of need IPA nid as opposed to bid IPA bd. GA does not have long vowels.

In both RP and GA, vowels are phonetically clipping phonetics shortened before fortis consonants in the same syllable, like IPA /t t f/, but not before lenis consonants like IPA /d d v/ or in open syllables: thus, the vowels of rich IPA rt, neat IPA nit, and safe IPA sf are noticeably shorter than the vowels of ridge IPA rd, need IPA nid, and save IPA sev, and the vowel of light IPA lt is shorter than that of lie IPA la. Because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable, vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or fortis.sfn Collins Mees 2003 pp=4650

The vowels IPA / / only occur in unstressed syllables and are a result of vowel reduction. Some dialects do not distinguish them, so that roses and comma end in the same vowel, a dialect feature called Phonological history of English high front vowels#Weak-vowel merger weak vowel merger. GA has an unstressed r-coloured schwa IPA //, as in butter IPA bt, which in RP has the same vowel as the word-final vowel in comma.

Phonotactics
An English syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound. Syllable onset and coda start and end are optional. A syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds, as in sprint IPA /sprnt/, and end with up to four, as in texts IPA /teksts/. This gives an English syllable the following structure, CCCVCCCC where C represents a consonant and V a vowel. The consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted, as is the order in which they may appear. Onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters: a stop and approximant, as in play; a voiceless fricative and approximant, as in fly or sly; s and a voiceless stop, as in stay; and s, a voiceless stop, and an approximant, as in string.sfn Brinton Brinton 2010 page=60 Clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas. Clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing, and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited. Furthermore, several consonants have limited distributions: IPA /h/ can only occur in syllable initial position, and IPA // only in syllable final position.sfn Knig 1994 pages=537538

Stress, rhythm and intonation
see also Stress and vowel reduction in English Intonation in English
stress linguistics Stress plays an important role in English. Certain syllables are stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently vowel reduction reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are not.sfn International Phonetic Association 1999 page=42 Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as can, have Stress and vowel reduction in English#Weak and strong forms of words weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence.

Stress in English is phoneme phonemic, and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress. For instance, the word contract is stressed on the first syllable IPAc-en  k  n t r  k t respell KON trakt when used as a noun, but on the last syllable IPAc-en k  n  t r  k t respell kn TRAKT ' for most meanings for example, reduce in size when used as a verb.sfn OxfordLearner'sDictionary 2015 loc=Entry contractsfn MerriamWebster 2015 loc=Entry contractsfn MacquarieDictionary 2015 loc=Entry contract Here stress is connected to vowel reduction: in the noun contract the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel IPA //, but in the verb contract the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to IPA //. Stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases, so that a compound word receives a single stress unit, but the corresponding phrase has two: e.g. to brn ut versus a brnout, and a htdog  versus a ht dg.sfn Brinton Brinton 2010 page=66

In terms of rhythm, English is generally described as a Isochrony#Stress-timing stress-timed language, meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables syllables between stresses are shortened. Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well, and vowel shortening causes changes in Vowel#Articulation vowel quality: vowel reduction.

Varieties of English vary the most in pronunciation of vowels, and are categorised generally into two groups: British BrE and American AmE. Because North America was settled in the late 17th century, American English American and Canadian English had time to diverge greatly from other varieties of English during centuries when transoceanic travel was slow. Australian English Australian, New Zealand English New Zealand, and South African English, on the other hand, were settled in the 19th century, shortly before ocean-going steamships became commonplace, so they show close similarities to the English in southern England English of South East England. The Hiberno-English English spoken in Ireland and Scottish English fall between these two groups. Some differences between the various dialects are shown in the table Varieties of Standard English and their features.sfn Trudgill Hannah 2002 pp=46

English has undergone many Phonological history of English historical sound changes, some of them affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few. Most standard varieties are affected by the Great Vowel Shift, which changed the pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift and Canadian Shift have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.

Some dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and phone phonetics phones than the standard varieties. Some conservative varieties like Scottish English have a voicelessness voiceless IPAblink  sound in whine that contrasts with the voiced IPA w in wine, but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced IPA w, a dialect feature called Phonological history of wh#Winewhine merger wine'whine merger. The unvoiced velar fricative sound IPA /x/ is found in Scottish English, which distinguishes loch IPA /lx/ from lock IPA /lk/. Accents like Cockney with h-dropping lack the glottal fricative IPA /h/, and dialects with th-stopping th-stopping and th-fronting th-fronting like African American Vernacular English African American Vernacular and Estuary English do not have the dental fricatives IPA /, /, but replace them with dental or alveolar stops IPA /t, d/ or labiodental fricatives IPA /f, v/.sfn Roach 2009 p=53sfn Giegerich 1992 page=36 Other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Yod-dropping yod-dropping, Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Yod-coalescence yod-coalescence, and reduction of consonant clusters.

General American and Received Pronunciation vary in their pronunciation of historical IPA /r/ after a vowel at the end of a syllable in the Syllable#Coda syllable coda. GA is a rhotic and non-rhotic accents rhotic dialect, meaning that it pronounces IPA /r/ at the end of a syllable, but RP is non-rhotic, meaning that it loses IPA /r/ in that position. English dialects are classified as rhotic or non-rhotic depending on whether they elide IPA /r/ like RP or keep it like GA.sfn Lass 2000 p=114

There is complex dialectal variation in words with the Phonological history of English short A open front and Phonological history of English low back vowels open back vowels IPA /   /. These four vowels are only distinguished in RP, Australia, and New Zealand. In GA, these vowels merge to three IPA /  /,sfn Wells 1982 pages=xviii-xix and in Canadian English they merge to two IPA / /.sfn Wells 1982 page=493 In addition, the words that have each vowel vary by dialect. The table Dialects and open vowels shows this variation with lexical sets in which these sounds occur.

Grammar
Main English grammar
Modern English grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly Analytic language analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax.sfn Knig 1994 page=539 Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in English, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong inflection strong stems inflected through ablaut i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs speak/spoke and foot/feet and weak stems inflected through affixation such as love/loved, hand/hands. Vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system he/him, who/whom and in the inflection of the copula verb to be. Typically for an Indo-European language, English follows Nominativeaccusative language accusative morphosyntactic alignment. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners i.e. articles, prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 page=22 English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as have and do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement fronting of question words beginning with wh- and word order Subjectauxiliary inversion inversion with some verbs.

The seven word classes are exemplified in this sample sentence:sfb Aarts Haegeman 2006 page=118

Nouns and noun phrases
English nouns are only inflected for number and possession. New nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding. They are semantically divided into proper nouns names and common nouns. Common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns, and grammatically into count nouns and mass nouns.sfn Payne Huddleston 2002

Most count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural suffix -s, but a few nouns have irregular plural forms. Mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier, e.g. one loaf of bread, two loaves of bread.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 page=5657

Regular Plural formation:
:Singular: cat, dog
:Plural: cats, dogs

Irregular plural formation:
:Singular: man, woman, foot, fish, ox, knife, mouse
:Plural: men, women, feet, fish, oxen, knives, mice

Possession can be expressed either by the possessive enclitic -s also traditionally called a genitive suffix, or by the preposition of. Historically the -s possessive has been used for animate nouns, whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -s also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from the noun root with an apostrophe.

Possessive constructions:
:With -s: The woman's husband's child
:With of: The child of the husband of the woman

Nouns can form noun phrases NPs where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 page=55 Noun phrases can be short, such as the man, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives e.g. red, tall, all and specifiers such as determiners e.g. the, that. But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as and, or prepositions such as with, e.g. the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers and modifiers. Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit. For example the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in The President of India's wife, where the enclitic follows India and not President.

The class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of definiteness, where the marks a definite noun and a or an an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include one, many, some and all, are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree with the number of the determiner, e.g. one man sg. but all men pl..  Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 pages=545

=Adjectives=
Adjectives modify a noun by providing additional information about their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 page=57 In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, and they do not they do not agreement linguistics agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases the slender boy, and many slender girls, the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.

Some adjectives are inflected for comparison grammar degree of comparison, with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix -er marking the comparative, and -est marking the superlative: a small boy, the boy is smaller than the girl, that boy is the smallest. Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as good, better, and best. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrasis periphrastic constructions, with the adverb more marking the comparative, and most marking the superlative: happier or more happy, the happiest or most happy.sfn Knig 1994 page=540 There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form.sfn Mair 2006 pages=14849

=Pronouns, case and person=
English pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them as well as a gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular distinguishing he/she/it. The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both in the sense of the previous accusative case in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb, and in the sense of the Old English dative case in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb.sfn Leech 2006 page=69 quote=Nominative is a traditional name for the subjective casesfn O'Dwyer 2006 quote=English has subjective, objective and possessive cases. Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used.sfn Greenbaum Nelson 2002 While already grammarians such as Henry Sweetsfn Sweet 2014 page=52 quote=But in that special class of nouns called personal pronouns we find a totally different system of case-inflection, namely, a nominative case he and an objective case him and Otto Jespersensfn Jespersen 2007 173=185 noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example harvcoltxt Huddleston Pullum 2002, retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.

Possessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms; the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun as in my chair, while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun e.g. the chair is mine.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 page=42526 The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address, and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as y'all found in Southern American English and African American Vernacular English or youse and ye found in Irish English.

Pronouns are used to refer to entities deictically or anaphorically. A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation - for example the pronoun I identifies the speaker, and the pronoun you, the addressee. Anaphorical pronouns such as that refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience, for example in the sentences I already told you that, or I told Mike I don't want to see him here anymore. The reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase e.g. he sent it to himself or she braced herself for impact.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 page=426

=Prepositions=
Prepositional phrases PP are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns, e.g. with the dog, for my friend, to school, in England. Prepositions have a wide range of uses in English. They are used to describing movement, place, and other relations between different entities, but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs. For example in the phrase I gave it to him, the preposition to marks the recipient, or Indirect Object of the verb to give. Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded, for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form, with her, to me, for us. But some contemporary grammars such as harvcoltxt Huddleston Pullum 2002 pp=598600 no longer consider government and case to be defining for the class of prepositions, rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases.

Verbs and verb phrases
English verbs are inflected for tense and aspect, and marked for agreement with third person singular subject. Only the copula verb to be is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects.sfn Knig 1994 page=540 Auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form periphrasis complex tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 page=51sfn Knig 1994 page=541

Most verbs have six inflectional forms. The primary forms are a plain present, a third person singular present, and a preterit past form. The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerundparticiple and a past participle.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 page=50 The copula verb to be s the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first person present tense form is am, the third person singular form is and the form are is used second person singular and all three plurals. The only verb past participle is been and its gerund-participle is being.

=Tense, aspect and mood=
English has two primary tenses, past preterit and non-past. The preterit is inflected by using the preterit form of the verb, which for the regular verbs includes the suffix -ed, and for the strong verbs either the suffix -t or a change in the stem vowel. The non-past form is unmarked except in the third person singular, which takes the suffix -s.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 page=51

English does not have a grammaticalised future tense.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 pages=208210 Futurity of action is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs will or shall.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 page=5152 Many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb be going to.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 pages=21011

Further aspectual distinctions are encoded by the use of auxiliary verbs, primarily have and be, which encode the contrast between a perfect and non-perfect past tense I have run vs. I was running, and compound tenses such as preterite perfect I had been running and present perfect I have been running.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 page=5051

For the expression of mood, English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as can, may, will, shall and the past tense forms could, might, would, should. There is also a subjunctive and an imperative mood, both based on the plain form of the verb i.e. without the third person singular -s, and which is used in subordinate clauses e.g. subjunctive: It is important that he run every day; imperative Run!.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 page=5152

An infinitive form, that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.

=Phrasal verbs=
English also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs, verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle which follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are to get up, to ask out, to back up, to give up, to get together, to hang out, to put up with, etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement e.g. lay off meaning terminate someone's employment.sfn Dixon 1982 In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including harvcoltxt Huddleston Pullum 2002 page=274, do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term phrasal verb. Instead they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e. he woke up in the morning and he ran up in the mountains are syntactically equivalent.

=Adverbs=
The function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs. Many adverbs are derived from adjectives with the suffix -ly, but not all, and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in the most commonly used adverbs. For example in the phrase the woman walked quickly the adverb quickly derived from the adjective quick describes the woman's way of walking. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as good which has the adverbial form well.

Syntax
File:Constituent structure analysis English sentence.svg upright=1.5 thumb In the English sentence The cat sat on the mat the subject is the cat a NP, the verb is sat, and on the mat is a prepositional phrase composed of an NP the mat, and headed by the preposition on. The tree describes the structure of the sentence.

Modern English syntax language is moderately Isolating language analytic.sfn McArthur 1992 pp=64, 610611 It has developed features such as English modal verb modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning. Auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the Grammatical voice passive voice and progressive grammatical aspect aspect.

=Basic constituent order=
English word order has moved from the Germanic V2 word order verb-second V2 word order to being almost exclusively subjectverbobject SVO.sfn Knig 1994 page=553 The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as he had hoped to try to open it.

In most sentences English only marks grammatical relations through word order.sfn Knig 1994 page=550 The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent is marked only by the position relative to the verb:

  style=text-align: center;
  The dog    bites    the man
 -
  S    V    O
 -
  The man    bites    the dog
 -
  S    V    O
 

An exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun, in which case it is doubly marked, both by word order and by case inflection, where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form, and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form. The example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject is represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun:

  style=text-align: center;
  He    hit    him
 -
  S    V    O
 

Indirect objects IO of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction S V IO O, such as I gave Jane the book or in a prepositional phrase, such as I gave the book to Jane sfn Knig 1994 page=551

=Clause syntax=
main English clause syntax
In English a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed of one or more phrases e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases. A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within a sentence one clause is always the main clause or matrix clause whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example in the phrase I think that you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause that you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted.sfn Miller 2002 pages=6069 Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies the meaning of the word letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that which can also be omitted.sfn Knig 1994 page=545 In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.sfn Knig 1994 page=557

=Auxiliary verb constructions=
main Do-support Subjectauxiliary inversion

English syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense, aspect and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example in the sentence the dog did not find its bone, the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not. Subjectauxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.

The verb do can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences, where it usually serves to add emphasis, as in I did shut the fridge. However in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above, it is used because the rules of English syntax permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present. Modern English does not allow the addition of the negating adverb not to an ordinary finite verb finite lexical verb, as in I know not  it can only be added to an auxiliary or copular verb copular verb, hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required, the auxiliary do is used, to produce a form like I do not don't know. The same applies in clauses requiring inversion, including most questions  inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb, so it is not possible to say Know you him?; grammatical rules require Do you know him?sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 page=114

Negation is done with the adverb not, which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb. A contracted form of not -n't can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English I don't know him is the correct answer to the question Do you know him?, but not I know him not, although this construction may be found in older English.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 pages=786790

Passive constructions also use auxiliary verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with get. For example putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen by her, or he gets seen by her.sfn Miller 2002 pages=2627

=Questions=
In English questions can be formed either with do-support do you know her? or with the interrogative pronouns e.g. what, who, where, when, why. In most constructions interrogative pronouns occur in a Wh-movement fronted position before the subject-verb compound, regardless of their grammatical role in the sentence. For example in the sentence what did you see, what refers to the grammatical object of the sentence but nonetheless occurs as the sentence's first constituent. Also prepositional phrases can be fronted when they are the theme of the question, e.g. where did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only one of the interrogative pronouns to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form is no longer in use by many speakers. For those speaker who do use it, it distinguishes between questions where the theme of the question is the grammatical subject of the verb, from those where it is the object or another grammatical role that is being questioned. E.g. who saw you?, but whom did you see?

=Discourse level syntax=
At the discourse level English tends to use a topic-comment structure, where the known information topic precedes the new information comment. Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 pages=136570 Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs e.g., it is raining or in existential clauses there are many cars on the street. Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.

Focus linguistics Focus constructions emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence, generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent. For example, the girl was stung by a bee emphasising it was a bee and not for example a wasp that stung her, or The girl was stung by a bee contrasting with another possibility, for example that it was the boy.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 page=1370 Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation, either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause. For example That girl over there, she was stung by a bee, emphasises the girl by preposition, but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition, she was stung by a bee, that girl over there, where reference to the girl is established as an afterthought.sfn Huddleston Pullum 2002 page=1366

Cohesion linguistics Cohesion between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as anaphora e.g. that is exactly what I mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event.sfn Halliday Hasan 1976 Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for Stance linguistics stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief, or boy! I'm hungry the marker boy expressing emphasis. While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.sfn Schiffrin 1988

Vocabulary

The vocabulary of English is vast, and counting exactly how many words English or any language has is impossible.sfn HowManyWords 2015sfn Sheidlower 2006sfn Algeo 1999 The two largest dictionaries of the English language overlap with each other very little, so the vocabulary of English must be even larger than the count of words in the most complete available English dictionary.sfn Crystal 2003b p=119 Early studies of English vocabulary by Lexicography lexicographers, the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality Corpus linguistics linguistic corpora,sfn Leech Hundt Mair Smith 2009 pp=2450 collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published before the end of the 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerized analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.sfn Algeo 1999sfn Kastovsky 2006

Word formation processes
English forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes. One of the most productive processes in English is conversion,sfn Crystal 2003b p=129 using a word with a different grammatical role, for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun. Another productive word-formation process is nominal compounding,sfn Algeo 1999sfn Kastovsky 2006 producing compound words such as babysitter or ice cream or homesick.sfn Crystal 2003b p=129 A process more common in Old English than in Modern English, but still productive in Modern English, is the use of derivational suffixes -hood, -ness, -ing, -ility to derive new words from existing words especially those of Germanic origin or stems especially for words of Latin or Greek origin. Formation of new words, called neologisms, based on Greek or Latin roots for example television or optometry is a highly productive process in English and in most modern European languages, so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism first originated. For this reason, lexicographer Philip Gove attributed many such words to the international scientific vocabulary ISV when compiling Webster's Dictionary#Webster.27s Third New International Dictionary .281961.29 Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1961. Another active word-formation process in English is acronyms,sfn Crystal 2003b pp=120121 words formed by pronouncing as a single word abbreviations of longer phrases e.g. NATO, laser.

Word origins
Main Lists of English loanwords by country or language of origin

English, besides forming new words from existing words and their roots, also borrows words from other languages. This process of adding words from other languages is commonplace in many world languages, but English is characterised as being especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1,000 years.sfn Denning Kessler Leben 2007 p=7 The most commonly used words in English are West Germanic.sfn Nation 2001 p=265 The words in English learned first by children as they learn to speak, particularly the grammatical words that dominate the word count of both spoken and written texts, are the Germanic words inherited from the earliest periods of the development of Old English.sfn Algeo 1999 But one of the consequences of long language contact between French and English in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of English has a very high percentage of Latinate words derived from French, especially, and also from Latin or from other Romance languages.sfn Denning Kessler Leben 2007 French words from various periods of the development of French now make up one-third of the vocabulary of English.sfn Gottlieb 2006 p=196

English has also borrowed many words directly from Latin, the ancestor of the Romance languages, during all stages of its development.sfn Kastovsky 2006sfn Algeo 1999 Many of the words borrowed into English from Latin were earlier borrowed into Latin from Greek.  Latin or Greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences, philosophy, and mathematics.sfn Romaine 1999 p=4 English continues to gain new loanwords and calques loan translations from languages all over the world. English has formal and informal Register sociolinguistics speech registers, and informal registers, including child directed speech, tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, while the percentage of vocabulary that is of Latinate origin is higher in legal, scientific, and academic texts.sfn Crystal 2003b pp=124127sfn Algeo 1999 pp=8081

English loanwords and calques in other languages

English has a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages.sfn Gottlieb 2006 p=196sfn Brutt-Griffler 2006 p=692 The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other languages.sfn Gottlieb 2006 p=197 That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages.sfn Gottlieb 2006 p=198 Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script.sfn Gottlieb 2006 p=202 Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.sfn Gottlieb 2006 p=202

Writing system

See also English alphabet English braille English orthography
Since the ninth century, English has been written in a Latin alphabet also called Roman alphabet. Earlier Old English texts in Anglo-Saxon runes are only short inscriptions. The great majority of literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman alphabet.sfn Gneuss 2013 p=23 The modern English alphabet contains 26 letters of the Latin script: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z which also have Letter case capital forms: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The spelling system, or orthography, of English is multi-layered, with elements of French, Latin, and Greek spelling on top of the native Germanic system.sfn Swan 2006 p=149 Further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace.sfn Lass 2000 Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced.sfn Mountford 2006 There are also systematic American and British English spelling differences spelling differences between British and American English. These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English.sfn Neijt 2006

Although letters and speech sounds do not have a one-to-one correspondence in standard English spelling, spelling rules that take into account syllable structure, phonetic changes in derived words, and word accent are reliable for most English words.sfn Daniels Bright 1996 p=653 Moreover, standard English spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling, for example the words photograph, photography, and photographic,sfn Daniels Bright 1996 p=653 or the words electricity and electrical. While few scholars agree with Chomsky and Halle 1968 that conventional English orthography is near-optimal,sfn Swan 2006 p=149 there is a rationale for current English spelling patterns.sfn Abercrombie Daniels 2006 The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the world.sfn Mountford 2006 p=156 Standard English spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word.sfn Mountford 2006 pp=157158

Readers of English can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or Digraph orthography digraphs used to spell consonant sounds. The letters b, d, f, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, y, z represent, respectively, the phonemes IPA /b, d, f, h, d, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, j, z/. The letters c and g normally represent IPA /k/ and IPA //, but there is also a Hard and soft C soft c pronounced IPA /s/, and a Hard and soft G soft g pronounced IPA /d/. The differences in the pronunciations of the letters c and g are often signalled by the following letters in standard English spelling. Digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include ch for IPA /t/, sh for IPA //, th for IPA // or IPA //, ng for IPA //, qu for IPA /kw/, and ph for IPA /f/ in Greek-derived words. The single letter x is generally pronounced as IPA /z/ in word-initial position and as IPA /ks/ otherwise. There are exceptions to these generalisations, often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of originsfn Daniels Bright 1996 p=653 or proposals by pedantic scholars in the early period of Modern English to mistakenly follow the spelling patterns of Latin for English words of Germanic origin.sfn Daniels Bright 1996 p=654

For the vowel sounds of the English language, however, correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular. There are many more vowel phonemes in English than there are vowel letters a, e, i, o, u, w, y. As a result of a smaller set of single letter symbols than the set of vowel phonemes, some Vowel length#Short and long vowels in English long vowels are often indicated by combinations of letters like the oa in boat, the ow in how, and the ay in stay, or the historically based silent e silent e as in note and cake.sfn Abercrombie Daniels 2006

The consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German.sfn Dehaene 2009 Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities that occur in the standard English spellings of commonly used words.sfn Daniels Bright 1996 p=653 Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English.sfn McGuinness 1997sfn Shaywitz 2003 Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.sfn Mountford 2006 pp=159

English writing also includes a system of punctuation that is similar to the system of punctuation marks used in most alphabetic languages around the world. The purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud.sfn Lawler 2006 p=290

Dialects, accents, and varieties

Dialectologists distinguish between List of dialects of the English language English dialects, regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of grammar and vocabulary, and Regional accents of English regional accents, distinguished by different patterns of pronunciation.

As the place where English first evolved, the British Isles, and particularly England, are home to the most variegated pattern of dialects. Within the United Kingdom, the Received Pronunciation RP, an educated dialect of South East England, traditionally used as the broadcast standard, and is considered the most prestigious of the British dialects. The spread of RP also known as BBC English through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural England to recede, as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects.  At the time of the Survey of English Dialects, grammar and vocabulary differed across the country, but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear.sfn Trudgill 2000 p=125 Nonetheless this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary, and in fact only 3 percent of the English population actually speak RP, the remainder speaking regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of RP influence.sfn Hughes Trudgill 1996 page=3 There is also variability within RP, particularly along class lines between Upper and Middle class RP speakers and between native RP speakers and speakers who adopt RP later in life.sfn Hughes Trudgill 1996 page=37 Within Britain there is also considerable variation along lines of social class, and some traits though exceedingly common are considered non-standard and are associated with lower class speakers and identities. An example of this is Phonological history of English fricatives and affricates#H-dropping aitch-dropping, which historically was a feature of lower class London English, particularly Cockney, but which today is the standard in all major English cities  yet it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of British society.sfn Hughes Trudgill 1996 page=40

English language in England English in England can be divided into five major dialect regions, West Country dialects Southwest English, South East English, Midlands English, and Northern England English Northern English. Within each of these regions several local subdialects exist: Within the Northern region, there is a division between the Yorkshire dialects, and the Geordie dialect spoken in Northumbria around Newcastle, and the Lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in Liverpool Scouse and Manchester Manchester dialect Mancunian. Having been the centre of Danish occupation during the Viking Invasions, Northern English dialects, particularly the Yorkshire dialect, retain Norse features not found in other English varieties. sfn Hughes Trudgill 1996 p=31

Since the 15th century, Southeastern varieties centred around London, which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects. In London, the Cockney dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes, and it was long a socially stigmatised variety. Today a large area of Southeastern England has adopted traits from Cockney, resulting in the so-called Estuary English which spread in areas south and East of London beginning in the 1980s. Estuary English is distinguished by traits such as the use of Linking and intrusive R intrusive R drawing is pronounced drawring IPA /drr/, t-glottalization t-glottalisation Potter is pronounced with a glottal stop as Po'er IPA /po/, and the pronunciation of th- as IPA /f/ thanks pronounced fanks or IPA /v/ bother pronounced bover. sfn Trudgill 2000 pages=8081

Scots language Scots is today considered a separate language from English, but it has History of the Scots language its origins in early Northern Middle Englishsfn Aitken McArthur 1979 page=81 and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources, particularly Scots Gaelic and Old Norse. Scots itself has a number of regional dialects. And in addition to Scots, Scottish English are the varieties of Standard English spoken in Scotland, most varieties are Northern English accents, with some influence from Scots.sfn Romaine 1982

In Ireland, various forms of English have been spoken since the Norman invasion of Ireland Norman invasions of the 11th century. In County Wexford, in the area surrounding Dublin, two highly conservative dialects known as Forth and Bargy dialect Forth and Bargy and Fingallian developed as offshoots from Early Middle English, and were spoken until the 19th century. Modern Hiberno-English however has its roots in English colonisation in the 17th century. Today Irish English is divided into Ulster English, a dialect with strong influence from Scots, and southern Hiberno-English. Like Scots and Northern English, the Irish accents preserve the rhoticity which has been lost in most dialects influenced by RP.sfn Barry 1982 pp=8687sfn Hickey 2007

File:Pin-pen.svg thumb 300px The merger of pin and pen in Southern American English. In the purple areas, the merger is complete for most speakers. Note the exclusion of the New Orleans area, Southern Florida, and of the South Carolina Lowcountry Lowcountry of South Carolina and Georgia. The purple area in California consists of the Bakersfield and Kern County area, where migrants from the South Central United States south-central states settled during the Dust Bowl. There is also debate whether or not Austin, Texas is an exclusion. Based on Harvcoltxt Labov Ash Boberg 2006 p=68.
Even before the independence of the USA, American English was highly homogeneous. Early American authors commented on the lack of significant linguistic variation across the colonised area of the Eastern seaboard. Today there is more variation, yet two thirds of Americans speak a broad dialect known as General American GA, although as with RP in Britain there are different accents also within it. Separate from GA is Southern American English SAE, widely spoken in the Southern states, and African American Vernacular English AAVE spoken by African Americans in most major cities. Some dialectologists also recognise midlands and western dialects of American English.sfn Rowicka 2006sfn Toon 1982sfn Labov Ash Boberg 2006sfn Cassidy 1982 Canadian English, except for the maritime East Coast varieties, is mostly similar to GA, but has some distinct traits, such as the Canadian raising Canadian vowel raising, as well as distinct norms for written and formal language.sfn Boberg 2010

General American is a rhotic accent. Whereas in Britain rhoticity is the socially marked accent, in the US non-rhotic accents are marked and often associated with lower prestige and social class. In a groundbreakingcn date=April 2015 study published in 1972 socio-linguist William Labov demonstrated this in the context of New York, by showing that rhoticity was used more frequently by employees in upscale department stores than in stores catering to middle and lower class groups, where the non-rhotic local New York accent was more frequent.sfn Labov 1972

Southern American English is also generally non-rhotic, although class- and gender-based differences in the degree of rhoticity also apply.sfn Levine Crockett 1966sfn Schnweitz 2001 The Southern Accent is often colloquially described as a drawl or twang.sfn Montgomery 1993 In addition to its rhoticity, SAE is characterised by a series of vowel changes, the merger of IPA // and IPA // before nasals the Phonological history of English high front vowels#Pinpen merger pinpen merger, the monophthongisation of some diphthongs, and sometimes creation of triphthongs by the breaking of a single front vowel into two syllables with an intervening glide, e.g. in the word dress pronounced as IPA deis.sfn Thomas 2008 page=9596 Traditionally Southern American English has been considered to have arisen as a result of the settlement history of the southern states, however more recent research has suggested that many distinctive southern features did not become widespread until the 19th century.sfn Bailey 1997

African American Vernacular English is also a non-rhotic accent, and some linguists ascribe this and other defining traits of the variety to its origins among enslaved Africans in the American South where non-rhotic English was spoken. Others however ascribe the distinguishing traits to substrate influence from different African languages spoken by the slaves who had to use Creole English as a lingua franca between slaves of different ethnic origins.sfn Bailey 2001 After abolition most African Americans settled in the inner cities of the North and here African American English developed to a highly coherent and homogeneous variety. It has often been stigmatised as a form of broken or uneducated English, but today linguists recognise it as a fully developed variety of English with its own norms shared by a large speech community.sfn Green 2002sfn Patrick 2006b

Australia and New Zealand
main Australian English New Zealand English
Since 1788 English has been spoken in Oceania, and the major native dialect of Australian English is spoken as a first language by the vast majority of the inhabitants of the Australian continent, with General Australian serving as the standard accent. The New Zealand English English of neighbouring New Zealand has to a lesser degree become influential standard variety of the language.sfn Eagleson 1982 Australian and New Zealand English are most closely related to British English, and both have similarly non-rhotic accents. They do however stand out for their innovative vowels, many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian English grammar differs from British English only in few instances, one difference is the lack of verbal concord with collective plural subjects.sfn Trudgill Hannah 2002 pages=1621sfn Burridge 2010 New Zealand English differs little from Australian English, but a few characteristics sets its accent apart, such as the use of IPA  for wh- and its front vowels being even closer than in Australian English. Some New Zealand accents of the South Island are rhotic, perhaps because settlers here often came from Scotland and Northern England rather than from the Southeast.sfn Trudgill Hannah 2002 pages=2426sfn Maclagan 2010sfn Gordon Campbell Hay et al. 2004

English is spoken widely in South Africa and is an official or co-official language in several countries. In South Africa, English has been spoken since 1820, co-existing with Afrikaans language Afrikaans and various African languages such as the Khoe languages Khoe and Bantu languages. Today about 9 percent of the South African population speak South African English SAE as a first language. SAE is a non-rhotic variety, which tends to follow RP as a norm. It is alone among non-rhotic varieties in lacking intrusive r. There are different L2 varieties that differ based on the native language of the speakers.sfn Lanham 1982 Most phonological differences from RP are in the vowels.sfn Lass 2002 Consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce /p, t, t, k/ without aspiration e.g. /pin/ pronounced IPA pn rather than as IPA pn as in most other varieties, while r is often pronounced as a flap IPA  instead of as the more common fricative.sfn Trudgill Hannah 2002 pages=3031

Several varieties of English are also spoken in the Caribbean Islands that were colonial possessions of Britain, including Jamaica, and the Leeward Islands Leeward and Windward Islands and Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, the Cayman Islands, and Belize. Each of these areas are home both to a local variety of English and a local English based creole, combining English and African languages. The most prominent varieties are Jamaican English and Jamaican English Creole Jamaican Creole. In Central America, English based creoles are spoken in on the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Panama. sfn Lawton 1982 Locals are often fluent both in the local English variety and the local creole languages and code-switching between them is frequent, indeed another way to conceptualise the relationship between Creole and Standard varieties is to see a spectrum of social registers with the Creole forms serving as basolect and the more RP-like forms serving as the acrolect, the most formal register.sfn Trudgill Hannah 2002 page=115

Most Caribbean varieties are based on British English and consequently most are non-rhotic, except for formal styles of Jamaican English which are often rhotic. Jamaican English differs from RP in its vowel inventory, which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in Standard English. The diphthongs /ei/ and /ou/ are monophthongs IPA e: and IPA o: or even the reverse diphthongs IPA ie and IPA uo e.g. bay and boat pronounced IPA be: and IPA bo:t. Often word final consonant clusters are simplified so that child is pronounced IPA tail and wind IPA win.sfn Trudgill Hannah 2002 pages=11718sfn Lawton 1982 page=25660sfn Trudgill Hannah 2002 pages=11516

As a historical legacy, Indian English tends to take RP as its ideal, and how well this ideal is realised in an individual's speech reflects class distinctions among Indian English speakers. Indian English accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as /t/ and /d/ often pronounced with retroflex articulation as IPA  and IPA  and the replacement of IPA // and IPA // with dentals IPA t and IPA d. Sometimes Indian English speakers may also use spelling based pronunciations where the silent  found in words such as ghost is pronounced as an Indian voiced aspirated stop IPA g.sfn Sailaja 2009 pages=1924
