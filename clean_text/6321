Character Development
Characterisation
The Herald Sun described Samantha as a &quot;smart, successful lawyer&quot;.7 Network Ten describe Sam as &quot;long-suffering&quot; and an &quot;off-the-rails lawyer&quot;, they also call the character &quot;fiery&quot;.8 During the Dan, Libby and Sam triangle, Daytime Confidential said Sam would &quot;go to incredible lengths to get Dan&quot;.9
Bipolar disorder
One of Sam's main storylines was her battle with bipolar disorder, which was triggered by a miscarriage.10 The storyline required careful planning as Neighbours production team wanted to portray the issue sensitivley.11 Buchanan whose real life brother suffers from the illness, worked closely with charity SANE Australia to carry out the relevant research.12 With their help the scriptwriters, production team and Buchanan worked to portray the illness as accurate as, possible.13 Buchanan's brother, Miles, suffers from the illness and is a spokesperson for the charity. He spoke of his delight that Neighbours decided to include such a storyline and praised it for being &quot;gripping&quot;.14 Buchanan immediately turned to her brother when she got the role of Samantha and he helped her with her portrayal of the illness.15 Buchanan herself felt that she had done the storyline justice, during an interview with the charity she stated: &quot;I think they&lt;U+2019&gt;ve done a great job, the writers really did their research beforehand; they spent time with people who have bipolar disorder, and worked closely with SANE Australia. They haven&lt;U+2019&gt;t glossed over it.&quot;16 Neighbours' executive producer Susan Bower said that it was important to represent the character dealing with bipolar disorder accurately.17 She said &quot;As a matter of course, any storylines involving health, police or adoption issues need to be properly researched. We have a responsibility because misinformation can cause a lot of problems, but proper information can do a lot of good. In the end, proper research also helps you tell the story better than making it up&quot;.18
2010 return
Sam returned in November 2010 as the prosecutor in Stephanie Scully's (Carla Bonner) culpable driving court case.19 Sam is determined to see Steph sent to jail and she forms an alliance with Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis).20 Buchanan said &quot;Sam comes back to Erinsborough with her lawyer's hat well and truly on. She mentions that she's now well again - her bipolar disorder is under control. She also talks about Dan and the fact that she's seen him and the baby.&quot;21 Buchanan also said that Sam has a personal agenda as well as a professional one, she is unhappy that Steph fell pregnant with Dan's child. Sam also wants to get back at Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine).22 Sam and Paul join up because Paul wants justice for Donna Freedman (Margot Robbie), whose husband Steph killed.23 Dennis said Sam is &quot;as devious as Paul is&quot; and he sees that Sam is a way to get his wish for Steph to be punished.24 Buchanan added that she surprised to be asked back because she thought her character had &quot;burnt her bridges with most people in Ramsay Street the last time around.&quot;25 Bower revealed that viewers can see that Sam has a score to settle with Steph and Libby and her questions open up a lot of wounds for Steph.26 Bower added that that issue has &quot;divided many fans.&quot;27
