The Apple Magic Mouse is a multi-touch mouse manufactured and sold by Apple Inc. It was announced and sold for the first time on October 20, 2009.1 The Apple Magic Mouse is the first consumer mouse to have multi-touch capabilities. Taking after the iPhone, iPod Touch, and multi-touch trackpads, the Magic Mouse provides a new way to interact with desktop computers using gestures such as swiping and scrolling.
The mouse requires Mac OS X 10.5.8 and Bluetooth. It can be configured as a left-handed or right-handed mouse and uses laser tracking for increased pointer accuracy over previous generation Apple mice.2 Since its release, it has been included along with a wireless keyboard with the iMac.
Initial reception to the Magic Mouse has been mixed, with positive reactions to its scrolling functions3 but negative reactions to its inability to middle click, or trigger Expos&lt;U+00E9&gt;, Dashboard or Spaces (features offered by its predecessor).4 It has also been criticized for long-term ergonomic concerns.5
