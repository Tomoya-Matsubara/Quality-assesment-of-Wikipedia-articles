Bryan James Gunn (born 22 December 1963 in Thurso), is a Scottish football manager and former professional goalkeeper.
As a player, he played most of his career for Norwich City. He also played for the Scotland national football team. He was appointed to his first managerial appointment by Norwich following years of behind-the-scenes work, including on the catering and coaching sides. He was sacked by Norwich two matches into the 2009–10 season.
Playing career
As a youngster, Gunn often played at left-back. Following youth experiences at Invergordon, Gunn began his professional career with Aberdeen in 1980. The presence of Scottish international keeper Jim Leighton meant that Gunn only played 21 games before he signed for Norwich City in October 1986. Gunn did, however, receive Scottish League Cup and European Cup Winners Cup winner's medals while with Aberdeen. At both finals, he was an unused substitute. Gunn forged a good relationship with then Aberdeen manager Alex Ferguson, and in 1997 Ferguson brought Manchester United to Carrow Road for Gunn's testimonial. While an apprentice at Aberdeen, Gunn had been a babysitter for Ferguson's children.
Gunn then spent the majority of his playing career at Norwich, becoming one of the most famous goalkeepers in the club's history. Gunn initially looked set to join Norwich in the summer of 1986 after they had sold Chris Woods to Rangers for &lt;U+00A3&gt;600,000, however an injury to Leighton meant that Ferguson kept Gunn at Pittodrie until October.
He went on to make 477 first team appearances for Norwich. He was twice voted Norwich City player of the year in 1988 and 1993 and during the latter season, Norwich finished third in the Premier League, their highest-ever finish. He was goalkeeper when Norwich reached the semi-final of the FA Cup in 1989, the joint third furthest the club has ever progressed in the competition, but missed the semi-final in 1992 through injury. His (and Norwich's) greatest moment came in the remarkable shock win over European giants Bayern Munich in the UEFA Cup, making several crucial saves that kept the Canaries in the match in the Olympic Stadium. In 2002, Gunn was made an inaugural member of the Norwich City Hall of Fame.
Before each half of a match, Gunn would run toward his goal and pretend to attempt to head-butt the crossbar. Fans caught on to this and would make a crescendo of noise, culminating in an &quot;Ooh&quot; when he &quot;missed&quot;. Gunn was forced out of the team by the emergence of Andy Marshall and had a short spell at Hibernian before retiring. A broken leg injury sustained during the 1998 close season effectively ended his playing career.1
Gunn made six appearances for Scotland, four of which were in World Cup qualifiers in 1993, when his career was at its peak. He was a member of the country's squad for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, but he played in none of Scotland's three matches at the tournament. Gunn was third choice goalkeeper, behind Jim Leighton and Andy Goram.

Coaching career and other activities
Bryan Gunn retired from professional football in 1999 and now lives in Framingham Pigot. In &quot;retirement&quot;, Gunn worked on the staff at Carrow Road in hospitality, partly in 'The Gunn Club', a catering outlet named in his honour, as well as other corporate functions around the ground. As well as his work on the staff at Norwich City in 2002 Gunn was made Sheriff of Norwich for the year by the City Council.
Gunn's autobiography – In Where it Hurts – was published in 2006. He became a 'Club liaison' for Norwich City in February 2007. He was involved in discussions over possible transfers and loan signings, giving the Manager more time with the first team squad. When new manager Glenn Roeder was appointed in November 2007, goalkeeping coach James Hollman parted company with the club, and Gunn became goalkeeping coach for the rest of the season.
Manager of Norwich City
Following the sacking of Glenn Roeder as Norwich manager in January 2009, Gunn was asked to take temporary charge of the first team.2 Whilst in temporary charge at Norwich, a Facebook group called 'Bryan Gunn for Norwich manager' was created by his daughter Melissa which gathered over 2000 members. Initially he was not considered a serious full-time candidate, but City won their first game against Barnsley under his management 4&lt;U+2013&gt;0.3 On 21 January he was appointed as manager on a deal until the end of the season,4 but Norwich were relegated from the Championship after losing their last three games of the season.5
Despite being relegated to League One, Norwich re-appointed Gunn as manager for the 2009–10 season.6 In the opening game of the season, Norwich suffered a 7–1 defeat to Colchester United.7 Despite a 4–0 League Cup win against Yeovil, Gunn was sacked six days later.89

Leukaemia appeal

At the height of Gunn's playing career, in the early 1990s, his young daughter, Francesca, was diagnosed with leukaemia. Norwich City fans were at first astonished by the sight of the goalkeeper running out with a completely shaven head; when news spread that Gunn had done so in support of his daughter, who was losing her hair through chemotherapy, Gunn received ever-more rapturous receptions. His ensuing fundraising for leukaemia causes have been very successful. Francesca died in 1992, aged just 2 years old. Gunn played a match for Norwich against Queens Park Rangers at Carrow Road just days after his daughter had died. He gave an outstanding performance that day, which went a long way to building his legendary status among Norwich supporters. His excellent form continued for the remainder of the season, resulting in him winning his second player of the year award.
