Early life

At the age of 16 Lees committed a robbery, for which she served eight months in prison when she was 18. She later said &quot;I had dropped out of college. Basically, I had gone off the rails because I was terrified of going to prison. I ended up taking lots of drugs.&quot;7 While in prison Lees decided to change: &quot;I just thought, 'I'm this silly teenage boy in a prison cell who has made a huge mistake and I want to be this happy person'.&quot;8 Lees moved to Brighton to study English at university, where she started to identify as female: &quot;In the space of six weeks I went from living in Nottingham as a boy with my grandma still alive, to living in Brighton as a girl&quot;.9 She was referred to Charing Cross Gender Identity Clinic where she received hormone treatment to begin gender transition.

Activism
Lees, working with Trans Media Watch, challenged Channel 4 to remove transphobic material from its broadcasts,30 and consulted with the channel for its documentary My Transsexual Summer.3132 She has worked with a number of media outlets to provide guidance on covering transgender people; in its 2013 Pink List award coverage, The Independent on Sunday said &quot;It was noted by our judges that the Daily Mail's coverage of trans issues has improved noticeably since she had lunch with its managing editor.&quot;33
Lees currently works with All About Trans, a project that tries to bring together journalists and other media professionals with transgender people.3435
In 2013, Lees topped The Independent on Sunday's Pink List, naming her as the most influential lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender figure in the UK; she was a judge for that award in 2011 and 2012.3637
Lees has said that social media is a key tool for transgender people to improve their societal recognition:

Lees also expressed objections to &quot;#fuckcispeople&quot;, a controversial trending hashtag on the social networking site Twitter, which she thought was counterproductive: &quot;It is much better to engage in a positive dialogue than through angry abuse.&quot;38
Personal life and identity
Lees has publicly identified herself as a bisexual trans woman and as a feminist.3940 Lees has written about how in the early days of her gender transition she received abuse for not passing.41
In response to the announced gender transition of Chelsea Manning, Lees revealed that as a teenager and before her transition, she had gone to prison for robbery. Lees&lt;U+2014&gt;who then was living as an effeminate gay male&lt;U+2014&gt;said of the experience that &quot;looking like a girly boy in an institute full of rough lads wasn't a barrel of laughs&quot;, but that prison was less violent than school was because other prisoners were more disposed to harming themselves than others.42 After her release from prison and being turned down for a part-time job answering phones, Lees described having an epiphany: &quot;When I realised I would like to change society, not myself, all these good things have come into my life.&quot;43 She subsequently received a referral to Charing Cross Hospital's gender identity clinic, and met her boyfriend shortly after beginning hormone replacement therapy.44
