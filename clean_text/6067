''' Sri Ragam ''' is an ancient raga in the Carnatic tradition. It seems unrelated to the Hindustani Shree. Notably, it takes the lower madhyamam being a janya raga of Kharaharapriya. Sri Ragam is much beloved and is considered to be highly auspicious. Most notable among the compositions in this raga is Tyagaraja's Pancharatna Kriti Endaro Mahanubhavulu wherein the raga is depicted without the dhaivatam.
