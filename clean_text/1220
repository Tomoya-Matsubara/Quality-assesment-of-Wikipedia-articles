Death Cult Armageddon is the sixth studio album by Norwegian symphonic black metal band Dimmu Borgir, released on 8 September 2003. It has since sold over 100,000 copies in the United States; the first album under Nuclear Blast to do so; and debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at number 169.1 The song &quot;Progenies of the Great Apocalypse&quot; is released as single with accompanying music video. The prior song featuring additional vocals from Abbath; along with &quot;Heavenly Perverse&quot;; being used, with &quot;Eradication Instincts Defined&quot;, as background music in the Hellboy film trailer, on the soundtrack to the videogame Br&lt;U+00FC&gt;tal Legend, and was featured as the theme song to the TV show Battle for Ozzfest. &quot;Eradication Instincts Defined&quot; was also used in a trailer for the film Stardust and the independent game &quot;Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet&quot;. Parts of the album were recorded with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. This would also be the last album to have Nicholas Barker on drums.
The artwork within the album displays what appears to be an industrial factory, inside of which the band members are living out their fantasies, some of which are similar to scenes seen in the music video for Progenies of the Great Apocalypse. Artwork was done by Swiss artist Joachim Luetke. Most of the songs have a common apocalyptic theme, and the track &quot;Unorthodox Manifesto&quot; features a rhythmic motif taken from the Terminator films.
This is also their first album to feature their third and current logo.
