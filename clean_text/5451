Elbegdorj is one of the key democracy leaders in Central Asia.1 Elbegdorj was one of the main leaders of the 1990 revolution that ended 70 years of Communist rule in Mongolia.

Early life and education
Elbegdorj was born into a nomadic herding family in Zereg sum, Khovd province, on 30 March 1963. He was the youngest of eight sons. Elbegdorj spent most of his early childhood herding livestock through the high mountains of Zereg sum.10 His father, Mongolyn Tsakhia, was a veteran of Mongolia's border conflict with the Empire of Japan that resulted in the 1939 Battle of Khalkhyn Gol. Elbegdorj finished the sum's eight-year school in 1979. Afterwards, his family moved to Erdenet City, and he finished Erdenet's No. 1 ten-year school in 1981.11
Army and USSR's Army Academy
In 1981&lt;U+2013&gt;82, Elbegdorj worked in copper ore mining and processing plant Erdenet Concern (currently Erdenet Mining Corporation) as a machinist. In 1982 he was drafted into military service. For submitting poems to the army newspaper Ulaan Od, which impressed army authorities,12 and heading a Revolutionary Youth Unit in the army, he was awarded with the possibility to study military journalism and Marxism-Leninism at the USSR's Military Political Institute (present Army Academy named after Hetman Petro Sahaydachnyi under the umbrella of Lviv Polytechnic National University13 in Lviv, Ukraine from 1983 on.1415 He was graduated from the academy with Bachelor's degree in journalism in 198816 and then began working for the newspaper Ulaan Od (Red Star).17

Then Elbegdorj studied with a full scholarship at Harvard University18 and graduated from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government with a Master of Public Administration (MPA) in 2002.1920
Democratic movement
 During his studies in the USSR, Elbegdorj learned about Glasnost and concepts such as freedom of speech and economic liberties. After returning to Mongolia, he met with other like-minded people and tried to present those ideas to a wider audience, despite attempts of repression from the Politburo and threats by his employer to lose his job. When giving a speech at Young Artists&lt;U+2019&gt; Second National Congress on 28 November 1989, in the end of his speech, Elbegdorj said that Mongolia needed democracy and appealed youth to collaborate and organize together to establish democracy in Mongolia. He told the audience &lt;U+201C&gt;We consider that Perestroika is a timely and brave step. Youth's contribution to this revolutionary matter is not by supportive talks but by certain work. Our contribution is our objectives to be fulfilled. Our objectives are: &lt;U+201C&gt;&lt;U+2026&gt;following democracy and transparency and contributing to glasnost, &lt;U+2026&gt; and to support truthful progressive power&lt;U+2026&gt;These are the objectives of an initiatives&lt;U+2019&gt; group. The group should be an organization that works. After the congress I hope we&lt;U+2019&gt;ll gather and discuss and you will participate in this (newly forming group). The organization shall be based on public, voluntary and democratic principles.&lt;U+201D&gt;21
The chairman of the congress stopped Elbegdorj's speech and warned him he could not say such things. It was 1989 and Mongolia had been a communist country for 68 years. At that time, it was alleged that one out of two people was an unofficial spy of communist party that would oppress people who expressed different opinions than socialism and communism. During the break of the congress, two young individuals met Elbegdorj and the three agreed to initiate a democratic movement and to secretly spread the news to other young people. Later the three, including Elbegdorj met and united with ten other individuals and they are known as the Thirteen Leaders of Mongolia's Democratic Revolution. At his return from the congress, his boss at the newspaper Ulaan Od warned Elbegdorj that he would be fired if he participated further in any activities out of work or engaged in any conduct inconsistent with communist and socialist ideology. Despite the warning, Elbegdorj and his friends met secretly with other young people in the circle auditorium of the National University of Mongolia and discussed democracy, free market economic policy, and other prohibited subjects of the time, and began to draft a plan to organize a democratic movement. They met many times and brought new friends and new supporters to join them secretly. One night they placed ads of their open demonstration in streets.22
On the morning of 10 December 1989, the first open pro-democracy demonstration met in front of the Youth Cultural Center in Ulaanbaatar. There, Elbegdorj announced the creation of the Mongolian Democratic Union. Over the next months activists led by Elbegdorj and others continued to organize demonstrations, rallies, protests and hunger strikes, as well as teachers' and workers' strikes. Activists had growing support from Mongolia's people, both in the capital and the countryside and the union's activities led to other calls for democracy all over the country.2324252627
After numerous demonstrations of many thousands of people in the capital city as well as provincial centers, Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party(MPRP) (present Mongolian People's Party)'s Politburo &lt;U+2013&gt; the authority of the government eventually gave way to the pressure and entered negotiations with the leaders of the democratic movement. In February 1990, Jambyn Batm&lt;U+00F6&gt;nkh, chairman of Politburo of MPRP's Central Committee decided to dissolve the Politburo and to resign on 9 March 1990. Thus paved the way for the first multi-party elections in Mongolia. Elbegdorj announced this news to the hunger strikers and the people those gathered on Sukhbaatar Square at 10PM on that day after the negotiations between leaders of MPRP and Mongolian Democratic Union. As a result, Mongolia became the first country in Central Asia to embrace democracy.28 Elbegdorj worked as the Leader of the Mongolian Democratic Union in 1989&lt;U+2013&gt;1997.29
Journalism career
Elbegdorj worked as a correspondent at Ulaan Od-newspaper of the Mongolian Armed Forces and as a chief of an army literature unit between 1988 and 1990.30 While in these positions Elbegdorj wrote articles mostly disclosing and publicly criticizing the brutal characteristics of &quot;year difference&quot; among privates in Mongolian army and also wrote articles to better the soldiers&lt;U+2019&gt; health and lives.31
Elbegdorj founded Mongolia's first independent newspaper &quot;Ardchilal&quot; (Democracy) and worked as its very first editor-in-chief in 1990. During his work as the editor-in-chief, Elbegdorj spread information on the core values of democracy and every Mongolian should have the rights and freedom defined by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. His articles and newspaper policy helped to change social thinking in Mongolia. In 1990 Elbegdorj initiated to introduce the freedom of press in Mongolia.32
Elbegdorj also helped to create Mongolia's first independent TV station Eagle TV in 1994.33 It was run by the former Mongolian Broadcasting Company, a joint-venture of the U.S. Christian missionary organization AMONG Foundation, and the Mongolia Media Corporation.
Legislative career
Elbegdorj was elected to the Parliament four times, in 1990, 1992, 1996 and 2008. As a Member of People's Congress, Elbegdorj co-drafted and co-adopted Mongolia's new Constitution on 13 January 1992.34 The new Constitution guaranteed human rights, democracy, freedom of religion, and free speech.35 He worked as the vice speaker of the Parliament of Mongolia in 1996&lt;U+2013&gt;199836 and the majority leader of the Parliament in 1996&lt;U+2013&gt;2000.37
Elbegdorj founded and worked as the head of Mongolia's first Entrepreneurs Association in 1991 as well. The association worked and helped to privatize livestock for free to their herders from the socialist collective farms. As a result, providing the first private property to almost half of Mongolia's entire population.38 He supported the privatization of state-owned assets and land.
While as the chairman of the State Commission on Rehabilitation, Elbegdorj initiated and brought the state to apologize for the victims and families of over 36,000 people that had been persecuted and mass massacred during the years of Mongolian People's Party's communist rule.39 He played a key role in the approval of the Rehabilitation Law, which provided rehabilitation and compensation to the survivors and families of political victims, and recovery from the Stalinist purges and prohibited future violation of human rights. In addition, the law established a Memorial Day for Political Victims.40
Elbegdorj, as the chairman of the Democratic Party, co-led the Democratic Union Coalition to its historic victory in the 1996 parliamentary election. He served as the majority leader of the State Great Hural (Parliament) in 1996-2000 and as the vice speaker of the Parliament in 1996-1998.41
In addition, Elbegdorj was a member of the National Counseling Committee of the Democratic Party in 1994&lt;U+2013&gt;2009; leader and chairman of the Democratic Party in 1996&lt;U+2013&gt;1999 and April 2006 &lt;U+2013&gt; September 2008 respectively, and chairman of the Democratic Union Coalition of the Mongolian National Democratic Party and Mongolian Social Democratic Party in 1996&lt;U+2013&gt;2000.42
Prime Minister
He served as the Prime Minister of Mongolia twice in 1998 and 2004&lt;U+2013&gt;2006.43
First term as Prime Minister
In 1998, a clause in the constitution was removed that prohibited members of parliament to take cabinet responsibility. Thus on 23 April 1998, Parliament elected (61&lt;U+2013&gt;6) Elbegdorj as the Prime Minister.44 During his first term, Elbegdorj attempted to solve looming economic, political, structural and social issues through several policy initiatives such as co-initiating Law on Press Freedom and playing a key role to pass the law in 1998.45 Based on this law, another law passed that changed all daily state newspapers into public newspapers without direct control and censorship from the government.
Elbegdorj's most significant achievement during his first term as Prime Minister was to collect tax and create tax income. The biggest tax payer and only significant income contributor to the government's budget at the time was the copper ore mining and processing Erdenet Mining Corporation(EMC) &lt;U+2013&gt; a joint stock company owned by the governments of Mongolia and the Russian Federation. EMC hadn't paid due tax, income and royalty to Mongolia's government between 1997&lt;U+2013&gt;1998 which resulted in the government financial crumbling.46 Because of this, previous Prime Minister Enkhsaikhan stepped down due to pressure from the opposition party, MPRP. After becoming Prime Minister, Elbegdorj ordered an audit of EMC. The audit results revealed that the state due income did not enter the state account, instead it went to dubious accounts of directors at EMC. This corruption related case was reported in detail in investigative series &quot;Swindle of the Century&quot; on Eagle television.47 Elbegdorj dismissed the EMC's chairman. As a result, the government began to receive due tax, royalty and income from the EMC.
In addition, at the recommendations of international financial institutions such as International Monetary Fund and the World Bank &lt;U+2013&gt; aid granters to Mongolia, and discount interest rate loan giver Asian Development Bank, Elbegdorj made a decision to sell state owned Reconstruction Bank which became illiquid and was experiencing enormous loss, the biggest financial burden to the economy since its establishment in 1997.48 Golomt Bank was the only one that offered to buy Reconstruction Bank.
In response to this and the change of EMC's chairman, the minority group at the Parliament MPRP demanded Elbegdorj to resign and thus resulted Elbegdorj to lose confidence vote at the Parliament.49 The Parliament had prevented Elbegdorj's government from selling the bank. Elbegdorj's decision to sell the Reconstruction Bank was proven to be correct. The bank bankrupted soon after Elbegdorj's first term as prime minister was over and resulting the bankruptcy led the government to suffer enormous amount of financial loss. Moreover, Elbegdorj assisted to complete the construction of Mongolia's first Wrestling Palace which was half built for a long time. He stayed in office until Janlavyn Narantsatsralt replaced him on 9 December 1998.50
Second term as Prime Minister
On 20 August 2004, Elbegdorj became a Prime Minister of Mongolia for the second time, despite not being a member of parliament.51 This time he headed a grand coalition government after the vote in the parliamentary elections had been evenly split between the two major political forces &lt;U+2013&gt; Democratic Coalition and the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.52
In his second term in the government, Elbegdorj proclaimed a fight against corruption and poverty, which he saw as the biggest challenges to Mongolia's economic development.53 Besides, Elbegdorj initiated a &quot;Green Wall&quot; environmental project to plant trees in barren areas and desert zones to prevent from dust storm coming from Mongolia to Asia and to reduce air pollution.54
During Elbegdorj's term, on 27 January 2005, the government controlled National State Television and Radio were converted into formally independent organisations with increasingly smaller control by the government.55 Also, legal provisions that prohibited demonstrations on Ulaanbaatar's S&lt;U+00FC&gt;khbaatar Square were abolished.56 To promote affordable computers and internet access, he established Information and Communication Agency under the government. He attempted to strengthen domestic businesses by reducing the administrative overhead, by eliminating excessive regulations, many licensing requirements, and import taxes for key product categories.57 During Elbegdorj's term, Mongolia was accepted into the European Union's GSP+ system,58 which allows Mongolian exporters to pay lower customs tariffs when exporting to the European Union. He subsidized and supported technical schools and specialized professions to reduce unemployment.
By a decision of his government English replaced Russian as the first foreign language to be taught in public schools.59 In addition, Elbegdorj initiated the erection of the Genghis Khan memorial complex in front of Mongolia's government house for the 800th Anniversary of the Great Mongol Empire. He also proposed to relocate Mongolia's capital to Harhorin, a small town 400 km west of Ulaanbaatar, at the site of the former (until the 1260s) capital of the Mongol Empire. U.S. President George W. Bush highlighted about Elbegdorj as one of the country's democracy leaders to have been serving as the Prime Minister in his speech in Ulaanbaatar on November 21, 2005.60 &quot;The world needs more people such as yourself who are willing to admire liberty,&quot; President Bush wrote Elbegdorj immediately after his visit to Mongolia.61
Elbegdorj's administration revealed the Customs chairman's corruption case amounting to millions of dollars from which the ex-chairman donated to MPRP party with hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2005.62 In August 2005, Elbegdorj wanted to run for by-elections in Ulaanbaatar's Bayangol d&lt;U+00FC&gt;&lt;U+00FC&gt;reg. However, the MPRP threatened to leave the coalition if Elbegdorj ran against MPRP candidate Miyeegombyn Enkhbold, and Elbegdorj withdrew.63 On 13 January 2006, the MPRP left the coalition anyway, and Elbegdorj was forced to resign. The MPRP proceeded to form a new government with the help of DP defectors and independent MPs, and Miyeegombyn Enkhbold became the new prime minister. The events triggered protests from some civic groups and their followers.64
Mongolian economy had real GDP growth of 10.4% in 2004, 7.3% in 2005 and 8.6% in 2006 respectively during Elbegdorj's second term comparing to 7% in 2003 prior to Elbegdorj's government.65

The new initiative calls for the allocation of certain funds from Mongolian budget to be used in support of democratic transitions in Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan along with economic reforms in countries such as North Korea and Myanmar while using Mongolia's democratic reform and consolidation as a model. In the summer of 2012 the foundation hosted several delegation from Kyrgyzstan, North Korea and Myanmar to study from Mongolia's experience of judicial reform and mineral legislation.94
To encourage the adoption of democratic governance in Asian countries, Elbegdorj, along with Korean President Lee Myung Bak, started the Asian Partnership for Democracy initiative in 2011 as an arm of the Community of Democracies with a particular focus on the region in which Mongolia is the only long standing democracy.95
Elbegdorj condemned the violence in Syria and called on world leaders to unify to end the bloodshed. He criticized the attack on the US Embassy in Libya saying, &lt;U+201C&gt;I was very saddened by the death of the Ambassador and others in Libya. The mission of diplomacy is peaceful. Attacking diplomatic compounds are violation of both the letter and spirit of international law.&quot;96 On 22 September 2011, the U.S. Foreign Policy Association and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) awarded Elbegdorj with &quot;Presidential Medal for Leadership in the Cause of Democracy.&quot; The award recognized the vital role Elbegdorj played in peacefully ending the 70-year-old communist regime and also his dedication to human rights, freedom, and support for market economy.97

Nuclear-free status
Elbegdorj has committed Mongolia to be nuclear-free and a nuclear free world as a principal component of his foreign policy agenda. The United Nations Security Council recognized Mongolia's nuclear-weapon-free status in 2012 despite the fact that it cannot join one of the World's Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zones, in part, because of the country's close proximity to nuclear-armed states Russia and China.99Mongolia renounced nuclear materials and became a member of Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in 2013 and UN General Assembly's President Vuk Jeremic congratulated Elbegdorj for these.100
Elbegdorj made international headlines in 2012 after being the first world leader invited to visit the Iranian nuclear facility in Natanz. After his visit, he stressed &quot;the program has to be transparent to the world; in particular, the program must be under permanent supervision of the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran's nuclear program must not endanger or cause threat to the interests and security of regional peace as well as of any other nation. Mongolia remains committed to safeguarding her nuclear free status, supported by the special UN resolutions. Mongolia will seek to contribute to securing universal peace by fully banning nuclear weapons in East Asia and the world at large.&lt;U+201D&gt;101
Participation in UN Peacekeeping operations
As commander-in-chief of the Mongolian Armed Forces, Elbegdorj supports Mongolia's commitment and participation in United Nations Peacekeeping operations. Since 2001, Mongolian troops have participated in international peacekeeping missions in Iraq, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Congo, Eritrea, Western Sahara and Afghanistan.102103 Elbegdorj visited South Sudan to encourage Mongolian soldiers on 15 February 2013.104 &quot;Elbegdorj&lt;U+2019&gt;s visit was the first to South Sudan by a head of state from outside Africa. His visit is also the first from a country contributing troops to the UN mission,&quot; Hiruy Amanuel, chief political affairs representative at UNMISS said.105 As a soldier, Elbegdor's son Erdene Elbegdorj has been participating in the United Nations peacekeeping mission in South Sudan since March 2013.106&lt;U+00A0&gt; &lt;U+00A0&gt;&lt;U+00A0&gt;
Anti-corruption
Elbegdorj's presidential actions have focused on advocating anti-corruption measures.107108 &quot;I sincerely believe that the true enemy of democracy and freedom is corruption... The worst theft is corruption which damages people's common rights and liberties...I am convinced that fighting corruption must be one of the most important duties of the Mongolian State today.&quot;109 Elbegdorj noted. Previously, during his terms as a prime minister, he worked to uncover and eliminate several corruption scandals including his handling of the Erdenet Mining Corporation's tax scandal,110111 and his administration dug out the Customs chairman's corruption case in 2005.112
In September 2009 Elbegdorj replaced the Community Council of Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC) formed by former President Nambaryn Enkhbayar which included sports and music stars and supreme clergy while expressing his dissatisfaction with its investigation of petty corruption instead of political level corruption.113 He then reorganized the council with professional lawyers.114
To create a dialogue among different stakeholders in the natural resources and mining community to stop corruption Elbegdorj opened a roundtable in Ulaanbaatar in collaboration with the World Economic Forum's Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) in March 2011. The meeting brought together top executives of Mongolian industries and NGOs to discuss anti-corruption initiatives in Mongolia.115 Moreover, he has encouraged the parliament to take actions to prevent from corruption and jointly organized with the parliament's State Standing Committee and the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance &quot;Policy Reform and the Funding of Political Activities&quot; forum.116 
Elbegdorj sees Chinggis Khaan (also referred to as Genghis Khan) as a leader from whom to learn for anti-corruption efforts as Genghis Khan sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth. &quot;Chinggis...was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law, and not with the distinctions between people. He was a man who knew that the good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces,&quot; Elbegdorj said in his speech on the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khaan's birth.117
Under Elbegdorj's presidency, corruption cases amounting from millions to hundreds of millions of dollars, ranging from misappropriation of state properties and assets such as a printing factory and buildings, funds and taxes have been tried by the courts and the courts convicted high level statesmen including a former president of Mongolia,118119 a former chairman of Mineral Resources Authority, ex-chairmen of state owned Mongolian Airlines MIAT and their allies. In addition, big scale corruption cases involving suspects such as former health and education ministers, former deputy chairman of Tax Authority are under investigation.120
Mongolia's corruption perception ranking reduced by 26 places in one year from 2011 to 2012 comparing to the 120th place to the 94th according to Transparency International.121 U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton applauded Elbegdorj and Mongolia on the country's democratic progress and efforts to end corruption in her speech at the International Women's Leadership Forum in Ulaanbaatar in July 2012.122
Women's rights
Elbegdorj has long been an advocate for women's rights and more proportional representation of women in decision making level of governments. He stressed the importance of women in leadership, highlighting the three-fold increase of women representatives elected in the 2012 Mongolian parliamentary elections in his speech at the UN General Assembly in September 2012. &lt;U+201C&gt;We need more women leaders. Women tend to see the whole picture. For society to advance, we need more women in public service at all levels &lt;U+2013&gt; local to global. They bring an unique perspective often missing in global challenges&lt;U+2026&gt; Have you ever heard of a woman bloody dictator or tyrant? I think not. If there were more women in power, I think we would have more harmony, more engagement and less suffering and less conflict,&lt;U+201D&gt; Elbegdorj said.123
In July 2012 during the meeting with Elbegdorj in Ulaanbaatar, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton praised Mongolia's recent parliamentary elections in which nine women were elected and applauded Mongolia for its &quot;courage&quot; in building a democratic system in a country surrounded by Russia and China.124125
Citizens Chamber
In 2009, Elbegdorj opened the Citizens Chamber-a public hearing forum which encourages the participation of Mongolian citizens in the parliament's decision making. In each proceeding, citizens are given time to speak and express their opinion on pending legislation. The hall is open to any of Mongolia's 2.9 million people and is located in Ulaanbaatar; some additional halls have been opened in other provinces. They are designed to encourage civil participation to have consensus between legislators and citizens before any open issue becomes law.126127
Abolition of capital punishment
On 14 January 2010, Elbegdorj announced that he would, henceforth, systematically use his prerogative to pardon all persons sentenced to death. He stated that most countries in the world had abolished the death penalty, and Mongolia should follow their example. He suggested that it would be replaced with a thirty year prison sentence. The decision was controversial; when Elbegdorj announced it in Parliament, MPRP represesentatives chose not to give the applause customarily due after a presidential speech.128 (See: Capital punishment in Mongolia)
Despite the harsh criticism from conservative politicians and the opposition, Elbegdorj's decision to abolish the death penalty and his insistence on adopting the 2nd Optional Protocol to the Convention on Civil and Political Rights was received highly among other nations around the world.&quot;Hands off Cain&quot; international organization awarded Elbegdorj with &quot;Abolitionist of the Year 2011&quot; noting Mongolia as an example that fosters the right to life among Asian countries.129
&quot;By ratifying the Second Optional Protocol Mongolia would add yet one more country in the world community to fully abolish the death penalty. Pardoning a life does not mean pardoning a penalty. The punishment for serious and cruel felonies must be severe, and must be just. However, I do not think it is just to deprive any citizens of life in the name of state. The right to life is one of fundamental rights of a human being and cannot depend on anyone, not even on the head of state. The state should respect very fundamental human rights, and secure them by law.&quot; Elbegdorj noted.130 Finally, in 2012 Mongolian parliament amended a law to join the 2nd Optional Protocol to the Convention on Civil and Political Rights; making Mongolia a state party to the convention and reinforcing the country's commitment to the abolition of capital punishment.131
Environmental protection
 The United Nations Environmental Programme awarded Elbegdorj as a Champion of the Earth in June 2012 for his commitment to environmental protection.132 U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon highly appreciates Elbegdorj&lt;U+2019&gt;s contribution to the international community&lt;U+2019&gt;s efforts for ensuring sustainable development and keeping climate change issues under control, as he emphasized in his congratulatory note to Elbegdorj for his re-election as President of Mongolia.133 In addition, Elbegdorj worked as a member of the World Economic Forum&lt;U+2019&gt;s Global Agenda Council on Climate Change for the year of 2011.134
Elbegdorj declared a day as Tree Planting Day and has been organizing a tree planting campaign around the country.135 On that day organizations and people plant trees to alleviate desertification in Mongolia. Many non-governmental organizations and social networks support Elbegdorj's call to plant trees.136 Under his patronage, schools began to have eco-classes, students began to plant and take care of trees they planted around their schools and television serials on planting trees have been broadcast.137 On 14 May 2011, Tree Planting Day, Mongolians planted two million trees.138
At the invitation of Elbegdorj, the World Economic Forum-Water Resources Group and Office of the President of Mongolia co-organized the Water Secure Future in Mongolia conference in Ulaanbaatar in which over 100 government officials, parliamentarians, civil society and private sector representatives participated to find ways to safeguard Mongolia&lt;U+2019&gt;s scarce water resources in the context of its rapid economic growth. They discussed about water use in the mining, agricultural and municipal sectors, shared case studies of international good practice for boosting water efficiency and ways of safeguarding Mongolia&lt;U+2019&gt;s water supplies. As a result, Elbegdorj and Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Chairman of the World Economic Forum-Water Resources Group and Member of the World Economic Forum Foundation Board, committed to form a Mongolian Water Alliance of key government entities, civil society representatives and private sector participants to support the transformation of Mongolia&lt;U+2019&gt;s water sector. Elbegdorj defined the purpose of the alliance by saying &lt;U+201C&gt;Managing our future water needs is key to sustaining Mongolia&lt;U+2019&gt;s economic growth. We must ensure fast and effective implementation of our National Water Plan. We will benefit from the international networks and experience of the Water Resources Group to help us do so.&lt;U+201D&gt;139
Dinosaur fossil return
Nearly complete eight feet tall and 24 feet long140 rare Tarbosaurus T. bataar141142 dinosaur's skeleton143 scavenged from Mongolia was announced to be auctioned at Heritage Auctions in New York City on 20 May 2012 with asking price of one million dollars.144 Fossils found in Mongolia are the property of Mongolia and its people by law.145 A Mongolian paleontologist in New York saw the ad and notified Elbegdorj two days before the sale146 and Elbegdorj promptly filed a lawsuit claiming the illegally smuggled skeleton in the United States Court through his American lawyer. The skeleton was sold despite a judge's order to halt the sale while the case was pending.147 Then the U.S. authorities seized the fossils to safeguard until the case's resolution.148 Elbegdorj and his lawyer won the case with the professional help of internationally well known American and Mongolian paleontologists.149 The U.S. authorities handed the fossils to the Mongolian party in May 2013 after the case was resolved.150 The skeleton along with other dinosaur fossils those returned together to Mongolia have been on display free to public on main Sukhbaatar Square in Ulaanbaatar since 8 June 2013 until it is placed in the new Central Dinosaur Museum in Ulaanbaatar.151 This is the first lawsuit ever claimed abroad by a Mongolian president.
Judicial reform
Elbegdorj convened &quot;Judicial Reform and Justice&quot; Forum in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia in April 2011.152 Mongolian parliament passed a package law on judicial reform submitted by Elbegdorj. Those laws designed to ensure impartiality of judges and justices and created a merit-based system for the selection of new judges and justices. In addition, the judicial reform allows citizens' representatives to participate in court hearings and trials and requires that all judicial decisions be placed on internet open for public.153
Supporting education
On 20 May 2013, Elbegdorj issued a decree that directed the government to provide financial support to Mongolian students to study at the world's top universities. By the implementation of the decree, Mongolian students accepted at the world's 20 top universities will receive funding from the government regardless of their major, and those accepted at the world's 100 top universities will be financed by the government if their major is included in the government's preferred professions.154
Elbegdorj put a veto on a section of a law amendment that would increase his salary; in return, he submitted a bill to the Parliament to give allowance as salary from government to all Mongolian students studying in Mongolia.155 The law was passed and all Mongolian students studying at any university or college in Mongolia have received monthly allowances of 70,000 tugrugs since 2011 and the allowance may be increased to 96,000 tugrugs as per government decision in September 2013.156
Elbegdorj is a permanent member of the board of directors of &quot;Young Leader&quot; foundation of Mongolia from 1992 and a member of the director's board of the Mongolian Academy of Political Education since 1993.157
Campaign to stop alcoholism
Elbegdorj has been calling to curb the abuse of alcoholic beverages in Mongolia. Under his patronage and in collaboration with his office, civil society and non-governmental organizations organized many activities such as Alcohol-Free Mongolia campaign.158 Elbegdorj banned the use of all alcoholic beverages at state dinners and state ceremonies under his name.159 Also he called government and its agencies not to serve alcohol at official ceremonies and functions. The World Health Organization awarded Elbegdorj its Regional Director&lt;U+2019&gt;s special recognition plaque. The award honors the public health leadership of a country leader and it is the first award for alcohol control in Western Pacific Region.160
Family and personal life
Elbegdorj met Khajidsurengiin Bolormaa at a Mongolian students&lt;U+2019&gt; party in Lviv, Ukraine when they were students. After their marriage in Ulaanbaatar, their first son was born in Lviv, Ukraine. They helped over 300 orphans through their Bolor Foundation. They adopted twenty children from state run Orphan Care Center (orphanage) in Ulaanbaatar after being the children's patrons for some time.161 Now they have twenty five children: four sons of their own and twenty one adopted children.162163
&quot;Elbegdorj is a risk-taker and puts others' needs before his own. A long-time (U.S.) Embassy employee recalled Elbegdorj accompanying the embassy officials on a trip to deliver humanitarian assistance to the countryside during a winter disaster in the 1990s. The road was snowed under, and Elbegdorj volunteered to go ahead to check for alternate routes, despite freezing conditions and deep snow,&quot; an U.S. Ambassador to Mongolia described Elbegdorj in his confidential wire to the U.S. authorities that was leaked in wikileaks.org.164
Due to being president, Elbegdorj asked his elder brother Arslandorj to give up from his position as a director of City Landscaping Department of Ulaanbaatar City in which sector Arslandorj worked for more than 20 years prior to his brother's presidency. Arslandorj quit his career at his brother's request. Also Elbegdorj tweeted announcing his job search in Mongolia for his eldest son Orgil who got Ph.D. in medicinal chemistry from Virginia Commonwealth University in the United States. The son got a job at a private pharmaceutical company in Mongolia later.165 Elbegdor's second son Erdene is a soldier in the Mongolian Armed Forces and has been participating in the United Nations peacekeeping mission in South Sudan since March 2013.166&lt;U+00A0&gt; &lt;U+00A0&gt;
