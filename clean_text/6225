A street newspaper vendor in Silver Spring, Maryland.

Street newspapers, or street papers, are newspapers or magazines that are sold by homeless or poor individuals and are produced mainly in order to support these populations. Most such newspapers primarily provide coverage about homelessness and poverty-related issues, and aim to strengthen networks of social benefits for the homeless and other marginalized individuals. Street papers also generally seek to provide employment opportunities, community networking and a voice for those marginalized individuals; in addition to being sold by homeless individuals, many street newspapers are also partially produced and written by them. Finally, many street newspapers seek to educate non-homeless readers about homelessness, although others focus more on mainstream news.
Street newspapers became common in the 1990s and are now published worldwide, with most street newspapers located in the United States and Western Europe. They are supported by governments, charities, and organizations such as the International Network of Street Papers and the North American Street Newspaper Association. Since the mid-1990s, there has been ongoing controversy among street newspaper publishers over what sort of material should be covered in street newspapers and to what extent the homeless should participate in writing and production.
Description
Most street newspapers have three main purposes:1

To provide income and job skills to the homeless and other marginalized individuals, who act as vendors of and often contributors to the newspapers
To provide coverage of, and educate the general public about issues pertaining to homelessness and poverty
To establish or strengthen networks of services and social benefits for the homeless and other marginalized individuals

The defining characteristic of a street newspaper is the fact that it is sold by homeless or marginalized vendors. While street many street newspapers also aim to provide coverage of social issues and educate the public about homelessness, this goal is often secondary: many people who buy street newspapers do so not to gain information and access the content of the newspaper, but to support, and express solidarity with, the homeless vendor.2
The precise details on who reads street newspapers are unclear. A pair of 1993 surveys conducted by Chicago's StreetWise suggested readers of that paper at the time were mostly college-educated, slightly over half were female, and slightly over half were single.3
Operations and business
Most street newspapers operate by having homeless vendors purchase each paper up front for a small fraction of the price, after which they sell the papers for a set price and retain all the proceeds from street sales.4567 The income vendors earn from sales is intended to help them &quot;get back on their feet,&quot;8 and requiring vendors to purchase papers up front and earn back the money by selling them has been said to help develop skills in managing finances.9 Vendors for most newspapers are identifiable by badges1011 or messenger bags.12 Many newspapers also require that vendors sign a code of conduct13 or otherwise &quot;clean up their act.&quot;14
Street papers get started in a variety of ways. Some, such as Street Sense,15 were started by homeless or formerly homeless individuals, whereas others are more professional ventures.16 Many papers receive aid from local government and charities,1718 and coalitions such as the International Network of Street Papers and the North American Street Newspaper Association provide workshops and support for new street papers.19 Many street papers develop in a bottom-up fashion, starting up through volunteer work and &quot;newcomers to the media business&quot; and gradually expanding to include professionals.2021 For most papers, the majority of revenue comes from donations, government grants, and sometimes advertising.222324
Specific business models for street newspapers vary widely, and range from vendor-managed papers that place the highest value upon homeless empowerment and involvement to highly professionalized weeklies that draw upon socially entrepreneurial business principles.25 Some papers are very successful, such as the UK-based The Big Issue, which as of 2001 sold nearly 300,000 copies a week and earned the equivalent of over 20 million USD, but most papers sell as little as 3,000 copies a month and barely generate a profit at all for the publishers.26
Coverage
 Most street newspapers report on issues regarding homelessness and poverty,27 and many papers also feature contributions from the homeless and the poor in addition to articles by activists and community organizers.2829 For example, the first edition of Washington, D.C.'s Street Sense included a description of a prominent homeless community, an interview with a congresswoman, an editorial about the costs and benefits of taking a job, several poems about homelessness, and a how-to and recipe section;30 likewise, a 2009 issue of the Lawrence, Kansas-based Change of Heart included a story on the recent bulldozing of a homeless camp, a review of a book on homelessness, a description of the Family Promise organization for homeless support, and a list of community resources,31 and content is submitted by the homeless.32 Many papers also feature profiles of individual street newspaper vendors.3334 The writing style in many street newspapers is simple and clear; social scientist Kevin Howley describes street newspapers as having a &quot;native eloquence.&quot;35
Unlike most street newspapers, the UK-based The Big Issue focuses mostly on celebrity news and interviews, rather than coverage of homelessness and poverty.36 It is still sold by homeless vendors and uses the bulk of its proceeds to support homeless individuals and advocacy organizations for the homeless, but the paper's content is mostly written by professional staff and geared towards a broad audience.37 There has been some disagreement between papers over how street newspapers ought to be run; while The Big Issue is professionally produced and emulates mainstream papers and magazines in order to generate a large profit to invest in homeless issues, many other papers believe they should focus on political and social issues rather than on money.38 Although The Big Issue has attracted attention and controversy because of its stature, it is not the only street newspaper with this sort of business model. Numerous other street newspapers work in a similar way, with The Big Issue just being the most well-known example of a whole category of street newspapers. Many publishers and advocates of street newspapers see commercialized papers such as The Big Issue and more grassroots-style papers as being two models in conflict.3940
Social benefits
In addition to providing some individuals with income and employment, street newspapers are intended to give homeless participants responsibility and independence, and to create a tight-knit homeless community.41 Many street papers also offer additional programs to vendors, such as job training, housing placement assistance, and referral to other direct services. Others operate as a program of a larger social services organization—for instance, Chicago's StreetWise can refer vendors to providers of &quot;drug and alcohol treatment, high school equivalency classes, career counseling, and permanent housing.&quot;42 Most street newspapers are also engaged in some form of organizing and advocacy regarding homelessness and poverty, and many function as &quot;watchdogs&quot; for the local homeless communities.43 Howley has described street newspapers as a means of mobilizing the networks of &quot;formal and informal relationships that exist between the homeless, the unemployed, and the working poor, and shelter managers, healthcare workers, community organizers, and others who work on their behalf.&quot;44
Challenges and criticisms
Many street papers face financial difficulties because of insufficient funding.454647 In the early days of street newspapers, people were often reluctant to buy from homeless vendors for fear that it was a scam.48 Furthermore, of the more activist papers, many papers fail to sell well because their writing and production are perceived as unprofessional and lackluster, and the topics covered are sometimes of little relevance or interest to either the general public or the homeless community49 and are perceived as lacking newsworthy content.50 (In response to these criticisms, organizations in Montreal51 and San Francisco52 have begun to offer workshops in writing and journalism for homeless contributors.) Papers such as StreetWise have in the past been criticized for being too &quot;grim,&quot; and for the vendors' being too loud and intrusive.53 Some newspapers sell well but may not be widely read, as many people will donate to vendors without buying, or buy the newspaper and then throw it away.5455 On the other hand, those papers that do sell well and are widely read, such as The Big Issue, are often targets of criticism for being too &quot;mainstream&quot; or commercialized.56
Other difficulties street newspapers face include &quot;transient&quot; or unreliable staff,5758 lack of journalistic freedom for papers that are funded by local government, and, among some demographics, lack of interest in homeless issues. For example, journalism professor Jim Cunningham has attributed the difficulties in selling Calgary's Calgary Street Talk to the fact that the mostly middle-class, conservative population has &quot;not enough sensitivity to the causes of homelessness.&quot;59 Finally, anti-homeless legislation often targets street newspapers and vendors; for example, in New York City, Cleveland and other locations, laws have sometimes prevented vendors from selling papers on public transit or other high-traffic areas, making it difficult for the papers to earn revenue.60
History
Historical foundations
Although the &quot;modern street newspaper&quot; began with the 1989 publication of Street News in New York City,6162 newspapers sold by the poor and homeless to provide income and bring attention to social problems actually date back to at least the late 19th century: Norma Fay Green has cited War Cry, published by the Salvation Army in London from 187963 to the 1920s,64 as an early form of &quot;dissident, underground, alternative publication&quot;.65 War Cry was sold by Salvation Army officers and the working poor to draw peoples' attention to the poor living conditions of of these individuals. Another precursor to the modern street newspaper was Hobo News, which ran from 1915 to 1930;66 Hobo News featured writing from prominent labor and social activists and Industrial Workers of the World members alongside contributions of oral history, creative writing, and artwork from hoboes.67 Another influential paper was The Catholic Worker, founded in 1933;68 this and most other street papers published before 1970 were affiliated with religious organizations.69 Like workers' papers and other forms of alternative media in the late 1800s and early 1900s, early street newspapers were often created because the founders believed mainstream news did not cover issues that were relevant to ordinary people.70
Modern street newspapers
Modern street newspapers began to emerge in the United States in the late 1980s, in response to increasing levels of homelessness and homeless advocates' dissatisfaction over the mainstream media's portrayal of the homeless.7172 Street News, founded in late 1989 in New York City, is normally cited as the first &quot;modern&quot; street newspaper.737475767778 Many more street papers were launched in the 1989 and the early 1990s,798081 crediting the high-profile New York paper as their inspiration; during the early 1990s, an average of five new papers were created every year.8283 The rapid growth in the number of street newspapers has been attributed to both changing attitudes and policies towards homeless individuals, and to the ease of publishing provided by desktop computers;8485 William Shaw, the editor of the Phillipines' Jeepney, has also claimed that government support, especially in the western world, has been influential in allowing street newspapers to thrive in the west.86 Since 1989, the concept has spread to include at least 100 papers87 in over 30 countries.88 In 2008, an estimated 32 million people worldwide read street newspapers, and 250,000 poor, disadvantaged, or homeless individuals sold or contributed to them.89
Papers have also been created in Canada, in European nations such as France, Russia, Germany, and Sweden (where the street papers Aluma, Situation Sthlm and Faktum won the 2006 grand prize award for journalism of the Swedish Publicists' Association9091); in the southern hemisphere (Brazil and The Gambia); and in Asia (the Phillipines,92 Vietnam,93 India and Japan94).95 The majority of street newspapers, however, are still in the United States and Western Europe.96 Within the United States, some street newspapers (such as Chicago's bilingual Hasta Cuando, are published in languages other than English.97
The mid-1990s saw the establishment of coalitions to strengthen the street newspaper movement. The International Network of Street Papers (founded in 1994) and the North American Street Newspaper Association (founded in 1997) aim to provide support for street papers and to &quot;uphold ethical standards.&quot;98 These organizations voted to combine their resources in 2006.99 These organizations have also collaborated to found the Street News Service, a project which collects articles from member papers and archives them on the Internet.100 In early 2009, the North American Street Newspaper Association hired an Executive Director for the first time.101
