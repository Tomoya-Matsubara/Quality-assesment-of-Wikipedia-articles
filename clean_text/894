Karl Emil Maximilian &quot;Max&quot; Weber (; 21 April 1864 &lt;U+2013&gt; 14 June 1920) was a German sociologist and political economist who profoundly influenced social theory, social research and the discipline of sociology itself.1 Weber's major works dealt with the rationalisation and &quot;disenchantment&quot; he associated with the rise of capitalism and modernity.2 Weber was, along with his associate Georg Simmel, a central figure in the establishment of methodological antipositivism, which presents sociology as a non-empiricist field which must study social action through interpretive means based upon understanding the meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their own actions. He is typically cited, with &lt;U+00C9&gt;mile Durkheim and Karl Marx, as one of the three principal architects of modern social science.345
Weber is most famous for the thesis in economic sociology which he elaborated in his book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. In this text, Weber argued that ascetic Protestantism was one of the major &quot;elective affinities&quot; associated with the rise of capitalism, bureaucracy and the rational-legal nation-state in the Western world. Against Marx's &quot;historical materialism,&quot; Weber emphasised the importance, for understanding the development of capitalism, of cultural influences embedded in religion.6 The Protestant Ethic formed the earliest work in Weber's broader project in the sociology of religion: he would go on to examine the religions of China, the religions of India and ancient Judaism, with particular regard to the apparent non-development of capitalism in the corresponding societies and to their differing forms of social stratification.
In another major work, Politics as a Vocation, Weber defined the state as an entity which successfully claims a &quot;monopoly on the legitimate use of violence&quot;, a definition that became pivotal to the study of modern Western political science. His analysis of bureaucracy in his Economy and Society is still central to the modern study of organisations. Weber was the first to recognise several diverse aspects of social authority, which he respectively categorised according to their charismatic, traditional and legal forms. His analysis of bureaucracy emphasised that modern state institutions are based on a form of rational-legal authority. Weber's thought regarding the rationalising and secularising tendencies of modern Western society (sometimes described as the &quot;Weber Thesis&quot;) led to the development of critical theory, particularly in the work of later thinkers such as J&lt;U+00FC&gt;rgen Habermas.
After the First World War, Weber was among the founders of the liberal German Democratic Party. He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in parliament and served as advisor to the committee that drafted the ill-fated democratic Weimar Constitution of 1919. After contracting the Spanish flu, he died of pneumonia in 1920, at the age of 56.
Biography
Early life and family background
Weber was born in 1864, in Erfurt, Thuringia.7 He was the eldest of the seven children of Max Weber Sr., a wealthy and prominent civil servant and member of the National Liberal Party (Germany), and his wife Helene Fallenstein, who descended from French Huguenot immigrants and held strong moral absolutist ideas.89 Weber Sr.'s involvement in public life immersed his home in both politics and academia, as his salon welcomed many prominent scholars and public figures.10 The young Weber and his brother Alfred, who also became a sociologist and economist, thrived in this intellectual atmosphere. Weber's 1876 Christmas presents to his parents, when he was thirteen years old, were two historical essays entitled &quot;About the course of German history, with special reference to the positions of the Emperor and the Pope,&quot; and &quot;About the Roman Imperial period from Constantine to the migration of nations.&quot;11 In class, bored and unimpressed with the teachers &lt;U+2013&gt; who in turn resented what they perceived as a disrespectful attitude &lt;U+2013&gt; he secretly read all forty volumes of Goethe.1213 Before entering the university, he would read many other classical works.sler1988&quot;/&gt; Over time, Weber would also be significantly affected by the marital tension between his father, &quot;a man who enjoyed earthly pleasures,&quot; and his mother, a devout Calvinist &quot;who sought to lead an ascetic life.&quot;1415

Education
In 1882 Weber enrolled in the University of Heidelberg as a law student.16 After a year of military service he transferred to University of Berlin.17 After his first few years as a student, during which he spent much time &quot;drinking beer and fencing,&quot; Weber would increasingly take his mother side in family's arguments and grew estranged from his father.181920 Simultaneously with his studies, he worked as a junior barrister.21 In 1886 Weber passed the examination for Referendar, comparable to the bar association examination in the British and American legal systems. Throughout the late 1880s, Weber continued his study of law and history.22 He earned his law doctorate in 1889 by writing a dissertation on legal history entitled The History of Medieval Business Organisations; his advisor was Levin Goldschmidt, a respected authority in commercial law.2324 Two years later, Weber completed his Habilitationsschrift, The Roman Agrarian History and its Significance for Public and Private Law, working with August Meitzen.2526 Having thus become a Privatdozent, Weber joined University of Berlin's faculty, lecturing and consulting for the government.27
Early work
In the years between the completion of his dissertation and habilitation, Weber took an interest in contemporary social policy. In 1888 he joined the Verein f&lt;U+00FC&gt;r Socialpolitik, 28 a new professional association of German economists affiliated with the historical school, who saw the role of economics primarily as finding solutions to the social problems of the age and who pioneered large scale statistical studies of economic issues. He also involved himself in politics, joining the left-leaning Evangelical Social Congress.29 In 1890 the Verein established a research program to examine &quot;the Polish question&quot; or Ostflucht: the influx of Polish farm workers into eastern Germany as local labourers migrated to Germany's rapidly industrialising cities.30 Weber was put in charge of the study and wrote a large part of the final report,3132 which generated considerable attention and controversy and marked the beginning of Weber's renown as a social scientist.33 From 1893 to 1899 Weber was a member of the Alldeutscher Verband (Pan-German League), an organisation that campaigned against the influx of the Polish workers; the degree of Weber's support for the Germanisation of Poles and similar nationalist policies is still debated by modern scholars.3435

Max Weber and his wife Marianne in 1894

Also in 1893 he married his distant cousin Marianne Schnitger, later a feminist activist and author in her own right,3637 who was instrumental in collecting and publishing Weber's journal articles as books after his death and her biography of him is an important source for understanding Weber's life.3839 They would have no children.40 The marriage granted long-awaited financial independence to Weber, allowing him to finally leave his parents' household.41 The couple moved to Freiburg in 1894, where Weber was appointed professor of economics at the university,4243 before accepting the same position at the University of Heidelberg in 1896.4445 There Weber became a central figure in the so-called &quot;Weber Circle,&quot; composed of other intellectuals such as his wife Marianne, Georg Jellinek, Ernst Troeltsch, Werner Sombart, Marc Bloch, Robert Michels and Gy&lt;U+00F6&gt;rgy Luk&lt;U+00E1&gt;cs.46 Weber also remained active in Verein and the Evangelical Social Congress.47 His research in that period was focused on economics and legal history.48
In 1897 Max Weber Sr. died, two months after a severe quarrel with his son that was never resolved.4950 After this, Weber became increasingly prone to depression, nervousness and insomnia, making it difficult for him to fulfill his duties as a professor.5152 His condition forced him to reduce his teaching and leave unfinished his course in the fall of 1899. After spending months in a sanatorium during the summer and fall of 1900, Weber and his wife travelled to Italy at the end of the year and did not return to Heidelberg until April 1902. He would again withdraw from teaching in 1903 and not return to it till 1919.53
Later work
After Weber's immense productivity in the early 1890s, he did not publish any papers between early 1898 and late 1902, finally resigning his professorship in late 1903. Freed from those obligations, in that year he accepted a position as associate editor of the Archives for Social Science and Social Welfare,54 where he worked with his colleagues Edgar Jaff&lt;U+00E9&gt; and Werner Sombart.5556 His new interests would lie in more fundamental issues of social sciences; his works from this latter period are of primary interest to modern scholars.57 In 1904, Weber began to publish some of his most seminal papers in this journal, notably his essay The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, which became his most famous work58 and laid the foundations for his later research on the impact of cultures and religions on the development of economic systems.59 This essay was the only one of his works from that period that was published as a book during his lifetime. Some other of his works written in the first one and a half decades of the 20th century &lt;U+2013&gt; published posthumously and dedicated primarily from the fields of sociology of religion, economic and legal sociology &lt;U+2013&gt; are also recognised as among his most important intellectual contributions.60
Also in 1904, he visited the United States and participated in the Congress of Arts and Sciences held in connection with the World's Fair (Louisiana Purchase Exposition) in St. Louis. Despite his partial recovery, Weber felt that he was unable to resume regular teaching at that time and continued on as a private scholar, helped by an inheritance in 1907.6162 In 1909, disappointed with the Verein, he co-founded the German Sociological Association (Deutsche Gesellschaft f&lt;U+00FC&gt;r Soziologie, or DGS) and served as its first treasurer.63 He would, however, resign from the DSG in 1912.64 In 1912, Weber tried to organise a left-wing political party to combine social-democrats and liberals. This attempt was unsuccessful, in part because many liberals feared social-democratic revolutionary ideals.65
Political involvements
 At the outbreak of World War I, Weber, aged 50, volunteered for service and was appointed as as a reserve officer and put in charge of organising the army hospitals in Heidelberg.6667 Weber's views on war, as well as on expansion of the German empire, changed throughout the course of the conflict.686970 Early on he supported the nationalist rhetoric and the war &lt;U+2013&gt; believing in particular that a &quot;liberal imperialism&quot; along the lines of the British model would help Germany to develop a more mature political class &lt;U+2013&gt; but in time Weber became one of the most prominent critics of German expansionism and of the Kaiser's war policies.71 He publicly attacked the Belgian annexation policy and unrestricted submarine warfare and later supported calls for constitutional reform, democratisation and universal suffrage.72
Weber joined the worker and soldier council of Heidelberg in 1918. Weber then served in the German delegation to the Paris Peace Conference and as advisor to the Confidential Committee for Constitutional Reform, which drafted the Weimar Constitution.73 Motivated by his understanding of the American model, he advocated a strong, popularly elected presidency as a constitutional counter-balance to the power of the professional bureaucracy.74 More controversially, he also defended the provisions for emergency presidential powers which became Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution. These provisions were later used by Adolf Hitler to subvert the rest of the constitution and institute rule by decree, thereby allowing his regime to suppress opposition and gain dictatorial powers.75
Weber also ran, unsuccessfully, for a parliamentary seat, as a member of the liberal German Democratic Party, which he co-founded.7677 He opposed both the leftist German Revolution and the Treaty of Versailles, a principled position which defied the political alignments in Germany at that time78 and which may have prevented Friedrich Ebert, the new social-democratic President of Germany, from appointing Weber as minister or ambassador.79 Weber commanded widespread respect but relatively little influence.80 Weber's role in German politics remains a controversial subject to this day.
Last years
Frustrated with politics, Weber resumed teaching during this time, first at the University of Vienna, then, after 1919, at the University of Munich.818283 His lectures from that period were collected into major works, such as the General Economic History, Science as a Vocation and Politics as a Vocation.84 In Munich, he headed the first German university institute of sociology, but never held a professorial position in sociology. Many colleagues and students in Munich attacked his response to the German Revolution of 1918&lt;U+2013&gt;19 and some right-wing students held protests in front of his home.85 Max Weber contracted the Spanish flu and died of pneumonia in Munich on 14 June 1920.86 At the time of his death, Weber had not finished writing his magnum opus on sociological theory: Economy and Society. His widow Marianne helped prepare it for its publication in 1921&lt;U+2013&gt;22.
Weber's thought
Inspirations
Weber's thinking was strongly influenced by German idealism and particularly by neo-Kantianism, to which he had been exposed through Heinrich Rickert, his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg.87 Especially important to Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief that reality is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from the way in which the human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions.88 Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist Georg Simmel.89
Weber was also influenced by Kantian ethics, which he nonetheless came to think of as obsolete in a modern age lacking in religious certainties. In this last respect, the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy is evident.90 According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the &quot;deep tension between the Kantian moral imperatives and a Nietzschean diagnosis of the modern cultural world is apparently what gives such a darkly tragic and agnostic shade to Weber's ethical worldview.&quot;91 Though the influence of his mother's Calvinist religiosity is evident throughout Weber's life and work, and though he maintained a deep, life-long interest in the study of religions, Weber was open about the fact that he was personally irreligious.9293
As a political economist and economic historian, Weber belonged to the &quot;youngest&quot; German historical school of economics, represented by academics such as Gustav von Schmoller and his student Werner Sombart. But, even though Weber's research interests were very much in line with that school, his views on methodology and the theory of value diverged significantly from those of other German historicists and were closer, in fact, to those of Carl Menger and the Austrian School, the traditional rivals of the historical school.9495 (See section on Economics.)
Methodology
Unlike some other classical figures (Comte, Durkheim) Weber did not attempt, consciously, to create any specific set of rules governing social sciences in general, or sociology in particular.96 Compared to Durkheim and Marx, Weber was more focused on individuals and culture and this is clear in his methodology.97 Whereas Durkheim focused on the society, Weber concentrated on the individuals and their actions (see structure and action discussion) and whereas Marx argued for the primacy of the material world over the world of ideas, Weber valued ideas as motivating actions of individuals, at least in the big picture.9899100
Weber was concerned with the question of objectivity and subjectivity.101 Weber distinguished social action from social behaviour, noting that social action must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another.102103 Study of social action through interpretive means (Verstehen) must be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that the individual attaches to their actions.104105 Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means, but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientists is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding (that of the scientist).106 Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of full-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited.107 Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science, but he noted that it is an unreachable goal &lt;U+2013&gt; although one definitely worth striving for.108

The principle of &quot;methodological individualism,&quot; which holds that social scientists should seek to understand collectivities (such as nations, cultures, governments, churches, corporations, etc.) solely as the result and the context of the actions of individual persons, can be traced to Weber, particularly to the first chapter of Economy and Society, in which he argues that only individuals &quot;can be treated as agents in a course of subjectively understandable action.&quot;109110 In other words, Weber argued that social phenomena can be understood scientifically only to the extent that they are captured by models of the behaviour of purposeful individuals, models which Weber called &quot;ideal types,&quot; from which actual historical events will necessarily deviate due to accidental and irrational factors.111 The analytical constructs of an ideal type never exist in reality, but provide objective benchmarks against which real-life constructs can be measured.112

Weber's methodology was developed in the context of a wider debate about methodology of social sciences, the Methodenstreit.113 Weber's position was close to historicism, as he understood social actions as being heavily tied to particular historical contexts and its analysis required the understanding of subjective motivations of individuals (social actors).114 Thus Weber's methodology emphasises the use of comparative historical analysis.115 Therefore, Weber was more interested in explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predicting an outcome of those processes in the future.116
Rationalisation
Many scholars have described rationalisation and the question of individual freedom in an increasingly rational society, as the main theme of Weber's work.117118119120 This theme was situated in the larger context of the relationship between psychological motivations, cultural values and beliefs (primarily, religion) and the structure of the society (usually determined by the economy).121
By rationalisation, Weber understood first, the individual cost-benefit calculation, second, the wider, bureaucratic organisation of the organisations and finally, in the more general sense as the opposite of understanding the reality through mystery and magic (disenchantment).122

Weber began his studies of the subject in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, in which he argued that the redefinition of the connection between work and piety in Protestantism and especially in ascetic Protestant denominations, particularly Calvinism, shifted human effort towards rational efforts aimed at achieving economic gain.123124 In Protestant religion, Christian piety towards God was expressed through one's secular vocation (secularisation of calling).125 The rational roots of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with and larger than the religious and so the latter were eventually discarded.126
Weber continued his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on bureaucracy and on the classification of authority into three types &lt;U+2013&gt; legitimate, traditional and charismatic &lt;U+2013&gt; of which the legitimate (or rational) is the dominant one in the modern world.127 In these works Weber described what he saw as society's movement towards rationalisation.128 Similarly, rationalisation could be seen in the economy, with the development of highly rational and calculating capitalism.129 Weber also saw rationalisation as one of the main factors setting the European West apart from the rest of the world.130 Rationalisation relied on deep changes in ethics, religion, psychology and culture; changes that first took place in the Western civilisation.131

Features of rationalisation include increasing knowledge, growing impersonality and enhanced control of social and material life.132 Weber was ambivalent towards rationalisation; while admitting it was responsible for many advances, in particular, freeing humans from traditional, restrictive and illogical social guidelines, he also criticised it for dehumanising individuals as &quot;cogs in the machine&quot; and curtailing their freedom, trapping them in the bureaucratic iron cage of rationality and bureaucracy.133134135136 Related to rationalisation is the process of disenchantment, in which the world is becoming more explained and less mystical, moving from polytheistic religions to monotheistic ones and finally to the Godless science of modernity.137 Those processes affect all of society, removing &quot;sublime values... from public life&quot; and making art less creative.138
In a dystopian critique of rationalisation, Weber notes that modern society is a product of an individualistic drive of the Reformation, yet at the same time, the society created in this process is less and less welcoming of individualism.139

Sociology of religion
Weber's work in the field of sociology of religion started with the essay The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism and continued with the analysis of The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism, The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism and Ancient Judaism. His work on other religions was interrupted by his sudden death in 1920, which prevented him from following Ancient Judaism with studies of Psalms, Book of Jacob, Talmudic Jewry, early Christianity and Islam.140 His three main themes in the essays were the effect of religious ideas on economic activities, the relation between social stratification and religious ideas and the distinguishable characteristics of Western civilisation.141
Weber saw religion as one of the core forces in the society.142 His goal was to find reasons for the different development paths of the cultures of the Occident and the Orient, although without judging or valuing them, like some of the contemporary thinkers who followed the social Darwinist paradigm; Weber wanted primarily to explain the distinctive elements of the Western civilisation.143 In the analysis of his findings, Weber maintained that Calvinist (and more widely, Protestant) religious ideas had had a major impact on the social innovation and development of the economic system of the West, but noted that they were not the only factors in this development. Other notable factors mentioned by Weber included the rationalism of scientific pursuit, merging observation with mathematics, science of scholarship and jurisprudence, rational systematisation and bureaucratisation of government administration and economic enterprise.144 In the end, the study of the sociology of religion, according to Weber, focused on one distinguishing part of the Western culture, the decline of beliefs in magic, or what he referred to as &quot;disenchantment of the world&quot;.145
Weber also proposed a socioevolutionary model of religious change, showing that in general, societies have moved from magic to polytheism, then to pantheism, monotheism and finally, ethical monotheism.146 According to Weber, this evolution occurred as the growing economic stability allowed professionalisation and the evolution of ever more sophisticated priesthood.147 As societies grew more complex and encompassed different groups, a hierarchy of gods developed and as power in the society became more centralised, the concept of a single, universal God became more popular and desirable.148
The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism

 Weber's essay The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism is his most famous work.149 It is argued that this work should not be viewed as a detailed study of Protestantism, but rather as an introduction into Weber's later works, especially his studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economic behaviour as part of the rationalisation of the economic system.150 In The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Weber put forward the thesis that Calvinist ethic and ideas influenced the development of capitalism.151 He noted the post-Reformation shift of Europe's economic centre away from Catholic countries such as France, Spain and Italy, and toward Protestant countries such as the Netherlands, England, Scotland and Germany. Weber also noted that societies having more Protestants were those with a more highly developed capitalist economy.152 Similarly, in societies with different religions, most successful business leaders were Protestant.153 Weber thus argued that Roman Catholicism impeded the development of the capitalist economy in the West, as did other religions such as Confucianism and Buddhism elsewhere in the world.154

Christian religious devotion had historically been accompanied by rejection of mundane affairs, including economic pursuit.155 Weber showed that certain types of Protestantism &lt;U+2013&gt; notably Calvinism &lt;U+2013&gt; were supportive of rational pursuit of economic gain and worldly activities dedicated to it, seeing them as endowed with moral and spiritual significance.156 Weber argued that there were many reasons to look for the origins of modern capitalism in the religious ideas of the Reformation.157 In particular, the Protestant ethic (or more specifically, Calvinist ethic) motivated the believers to work hard, be successful in business and reinvest their profits in further development rather than frivolous pleasures.158 The notion of calling meant that each individual had to take action in order to be saved; just being a member of the Church was not enough.159 Predestination also reduced antagonising over economic inequality and further, it meant that a material wealth could be taken as a sign of salvation in the afterlife.160161 The believers thus justified pursuit of profit with religion, as instead of being fuelled by morally suspect greed or ambition, their actions were motivated by a highly moral and respected philosophy.162 This Weber called the &quot;spirit of capitalism&quot;: it was the Protestant religious ideology that was behind &lt;U+2013&gt; and inevitably lead to &lt;U+2013&gt; the capitalist economic system.163 This theory is often viewed as a reversal of Marx's thesis that the economic &quot;base&quot; of society determines all other aspects of it.164
Weber abandoned research into Protestantism because his colleague Ernst Troeltsch, a professional theologian, had begun work on the book The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects. Another reason for Weber's decision was that Troeltsch's work already achieved what he desired in that area: laying the groundwork for a comparative analysis of religion and society.165
The phrase &quot;work ethic&quot; used in modern commentary is a derivative of the &quot;Protestant ethic&quot; discussed by Weber. It was adopted when the idea of the Protestant ethic was generalised to apply to the Japanese people, Jews and other non-Christians and thus lost its religious connotations.166
The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism

The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism was Weber's second major work on the sociology of religion. Weber focused on those aspects of Chinese society that were different from those of Western Europe and especially contrasted with Puritanism and posed a question why capitalism did not develop in China.167 He focused on the issues of Chinese urban development, Chinese patrimonialism and officialdom and Chinese religion and philosophy (primarily, Confucianism and Taoism), as the areas in which Chinese development differed most distinctively from the European route.168
According to Weber, Confucianism and Puritanism are mutually exclusive types of rational thought, each attempting to prescribe a way of life based on religious dogma.169 Notably, they both valued self control and restraint and did not oppose accumulation of wealth.170 However, to both those qualities were just means to the final goal and here they were divided by a key difference.171 Confucianism's goal was &quot;a cultured status position&quot;, while Puritanism's goal was to create individuals who are &quot;tools of God&quot;.172 The intensity of belief and enthusiasm for action were rare in Confucianism, but common in Protestantism.173 Actively working for wealth was unbecoming a proper Confucian.174 Therefore, Weber states that it was this difference in social attitudes and mentality, shaped by the respective, dominant religions, that contributed to the development of capitalism in the West and the absence of it in China.175
The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism

The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism was Weber's third major work on the sociology of religion. In this work he deals with the structure of Indian society, with the orthodox doctrines of Hinduism and the heterodox doctrines of Buddhism, with modifications brought by the influence of popular religiosity and finally with the impact of religious beliefs on the secular ethic of Indian society.176 Like Confucianism in China, for Weber, hinduism in India was a barrier for capitalism.177 The Indian caste system made it very difficult for individuals to advance in the society beyond their caste.178 Activity, including economic activity, was seen as unimportant in the context of the advancement of the soul.179
Weber ended his research of society and religion in India by bringing in insights from his previous work on China to discuss similarities of the Asian belief systems.180 He notes that the beliefs saw the meaning of life as otherwoldy mystical experience.181 The social world is fundamentally divided between the educated elite, following the guidance of a prophet or wise man and the uneducated masses whose believes are centred on magic.182 In Asia, there was no Messianic prophecy to plan and meaning to the everyday life of educated and uneducated alike.183 Weber juxtaposed such Messianic prophecies (also called ethical prophecies), notably from the Near East region to the exemplary prophecies found on the Asiatic mainland, focused more on reaching to the educated elites and enlightening them on the proper ways to live one's life, usually with little emphasis on hard work and material world.184185 It was those differences that prevented the countries of the Occident from following the paths of the earlier Chinese and Indian civilisations. His next work, Ancient Judaism was an attempt to prove this theory.186
Ancient Judaism

In Ancient Judaism, his fourth major work on the sociology of religion, Weber attempted to explain the factors which resulted in the early differences between Oriental and Occidental religiosity.187 He contrasted the innerworldly asceticism developed by Western Christianity with mystical contemplation of the kind developed in India.188 Weber noted that some aspects of Christianity sought to conquer and change the world, rather than withdraw from its imperfections.189 This fundamental characteristic of Christianity (when compared to Far Eastern religions) stems originally from ancient Jewish prophecy.190
Weber noted that Judaism not only fathered Christianity and Islam, but was crucial to the rise of the modern Occident state; Judaism's influence was as important as Hellenistic and Roman cultures.
Weber's premature death in 1920 prevented him from following his planned analysis of Psalms, the Book of Jacob, Talmudic Jewry, early Christianity and Islam.
Politics and government
In political sociology, one of Weber's most significant contributions is his Politics as a Vocation essay. Therein, Weber unveils the definition of the state that has become so pivotal to Western social thought: that the state is that entity which possesses a delegatable monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force.191 Weber wrote that politics is the sharing of state's power between various groups, and political leaders are those who wield this power.192 A politician must not be a man of the &quot;true Christian ethic&quot;, understood by Weber as being the ethic of the Sermon on the Mount, that is to say, the injunction to turn the other cheek.193 An adherent of such an ethic ought rather to be understood to be a saint, for it is only saints, according to Weber, that can appropriately follow it.194 The political realm is no realm for saints; a politician ought to marry the ethic of ultimate ends and the ethic of responsibility and must possess both a passion for his vocation and the capacity to distance himself from the subject of his exertions (the governed).195
Weber distinguished three ideal types of political leadership (alternatively referred to as three types of domination, legitimisation or authority):

charismatic domination (familial and religious),
traditional domination (patriarchs, patrimonialism, feudalism) and
legal domination (modern law and state, bureaucracy).196

In his view, every historical relation between rulers and ruled contained such elements and they can be analysed on the basis of this tripartite distinction.197 He notes that the instability of charismatic authority forces it to &quot;routinise&quot; into a more structured form of authority.198 In a pure type of traditional rule, sufficient resistance to a ruler can lead to a &quot;traditional revolution&quot;. The move towards a rational-legal structure of authority, utilising a bureaucratic structure, is inevitable in the end.199 Thus this theory can be sometimes viewed as part of the social evolutionism theory. This ties to his broader concept of rationalisation by suggesting the inevitability of a move in this direction.200

Weber described many ideal types of public administration and government in his masterpiece Economy and Society (1922). His critical study of the bureaucratisation of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work.201202 It was Weber who began the studies of bureaucracy and whose works led to the popularisation of this term.203 Many aspects of modern public administration go back to him and a classic, hierarchically organised civil service of the Continental type is called &quot;Weberian civil service&quot;.204 As the most efficient and rational way of organising, bureaucratisation for Weber was the key part of the rational-legal authority and furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing rationalisation of the Western society.205206
Weber listed several preconditions for the emergence of the bureaucracy:207 The growth in space and population being administered, the growth in complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out and the existence of a monetary economy &lt;U+2013&gt; these resulted in a need for a more efficient administrative system.208 Development of communication and transportation technologies made more efficient administration possible (and popularly requested) and democratisation and rationalisation of culture resulted in demands that the new system treat everybody equally.209
Weber's ideal bureaucracy is characterised by hierarchical organisation, by delineated lines of authority in a fixed area of activity, by action taken (and recorded) on the basis of written rules, by bureaucratic officials needing expert training, by rules being implemented neutrally and by career advancement depending on technical qualifications judged by organisations, not by individuals.210211

While recognising bureaucracy as the most efficient form of organisation and even indispensable for the modern state, Weber also saw it as a threat to individual freedoms and the ongoing bureaucratisation as leading to a &quot;polar night of icy darkness&quot;, in which increasing rationalisation of human life traps individuals in the aforementioned &quot;iron cage&quot; of bureaucratic, rule-based, rational control.212213 In order to counteract bureaucrats, the system needs entrepreneurs and politicians.214
Social stratification
Weber also formulated a three-component theory of stratification, with Social class, Social status and Political party as conceptually distinct elements.215

Social class is based on economically determined relationship to the market (owner, renter, employee etc.).
Status class is based on non-economical qualities like honour, prestige and religion.
Party class refers to affiliations in the political domain.

All three dimensions have consequences for what Weber called &quot;life chances&quot; (opportunities to improve one's life).216
Economics
Weber regarded himself primarily as a &quot;political economist,&quot;217218219 and all of his professorial appointments were in economics, though today his contributions in that field are largely overshadowed by his role as a founder of modern sociology. As an economist, Weber belonged to the &quot;youngest&quot; German historical school of economics.220 The great differences between that school's interests and methods on the one hand and those of the neoclassical school (from which modern mainstream economics largely derives) on the other, explain why Weber's influence on economics today is hard to discern.221
Though his research interests were always in line with those of the German historicists, with a strong emphasis on interpreting economic history, Weber's defence of &quot;methodological individualism&quot; in the social sciences represented an important break with that school and an embracing of many of the arguments that had been made against the historicists by Carl Menger, the founder of the Austrian School of economics, in the context of the academic Methodenstreit (&quot;debate over methods&quot;) of the late 19th century.222 Unlike other historicists, Weber also accepted the marginal theory of value and taught it to his students.223224
The phrase &quot;methodological individualism,&quot; which has come into common usage in modern debates about the connection between microeconomics and macroeconomics, was coined by the Austrian-American economist Joseph Schumpeter in 1908 as a way of referring to the views of Weber.225 According to Weber's theses, social research cannot be fully inductive or descriptive, because understanding some phenomenon implies that the researcher must go beyond mere description and interpret it; interpretation requires classification according to abstract &quot;ideal (pure) types&quot;.226 This, together with his antipositivistic argumentation (see Verstehen), can be taken as a methodological justification for the model of the &quot;rational economic man&quot; (homo economicus), which is at the heart of modern mainstream economics.227228
In terms of concrete research, Weber's best known work in economics concerned the relations between religion and capitalism, which he explored in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism as well as in his other works on the sociology of religion.229 Other contributions include his early work on the economic history of Roman agrarian society (1891) and on the labour relations in Eastern Germany (1892), his analysis of the history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages (1889), his critique of Marxism, the discussion of the roles of idealism and materialism in the history of capitalism in his Economy and Society (1922) and his General Economic History (1923), a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School.230
Though today read primarily by sociologists and social philosophers, Weber's work did have a significant influence on Frank Knight, one of the founders of the neoclassical Chicago school of economics, who translated Weber's General Economic History into English in 1927.231 Knight also wrote in 1956 that Max Weber was the only economist who dealt with the problem of understanding the emergence of modern capitalism &quot;from the angle which alone can yield an answer to such questions, that is, the angle of comparative history in the broad sense.&quot;232
Economic calculation
Weber, like his colleague Werner Sombart, regarded economic calculation and especially the double-entry bookkeeping method of business accounting, as one of the most important forms of rationalisation associated the development of modern capitalism.233 Weber's preoccupation with the importance of economic calculation led him to develop a critique of socialism as a system that lacked a mechanism for allocating resources efficiently in order to satisfy human needs.234 In his introduction to his Collected Essays in the Sociology of Religion (1920), Weber argues that

In his capital work on sociological theory, Economy and Society Weber elaborates on this point.235236 Socialist intellectuals like Otto Neurath had realised that in a completely socialised economy, prices would not exist and central planners would have to resort to in-kind (rather than monetary) economic calculation.237238 According to Weber, this type of coordination would be inefficient, especially because it would be incapable of solving the problem of imputation (i.e. of accurately determining the relative values of capital goods).239240 Weber wrote that, under full socialism,

This argument against socialism was made independently, at about the same time, by Ludwig von Mises.241242 Weber himself had a significant influence on Mises, whom he had befriended when they were both at the University of Vienna in the spring of 1918,243 and, through Mises, on several other economists associated with the Austrian School in the 20th century.244 Friedrich Hayek in particular elaborated the arguments of Weber and Mises about economic calculation into a central part of free market economics's intellectual assault on socialism, as well as into a model for the spontaneous coordination of &quot;dispersed knowledge&quot; in markets.245246247
Legacy

Whereas Durkheim, following Comte, worked in the positivist tradition, Weber created and worked &lt;U+2013&gt; like Werner Sombart, his friend and later the most famous representative of German sociology &lt;U+2013&gt; in the antipositivist, hermeneutic, tradition.248 These works pioneered the antipositivistic revolution in social sciences, stressing (as in the work of Wilhelm Dilthey) the difference between the social sciences and natural sciences.249
Weber's most famous work relates to economic sociology, political sociology and the sociology of religion. Along with Karl Marx and &lt;U+00C9&gt;mile Durkheim,250 he is regarded as one of the founders of modern sociology.
Weber presented sociology as the science of human social action; action which he separated into traditional, affectional, value-rational and instrumental.251252

In his time, however, Weber was viewed primarily as a historian and an economist.253254 The breadth of Weber's topical interests is apparent in the depth of his social theory:

Many of Weber's works famous today were collected, revised and published posthumously. Significant interpretations of his writings were produced by such sociological luminaries as Talcott Parsons and C. Wright Mills. Parsons in particular imparted to Weber's works a functionalist, teleological perspective; this personal interpretation has been criticised for a latent conservatism.255
Weber has influenced many later thinkers, such as Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Gy&lt;U+00F6&gt;rgy Luk&lt;U+00E1&gt;cs and J&lt;U+00FC&gt;rgen Habermas.256 Different elements of his thought were acclaimed by Carl Schmitt, Joseph Schumpeter, Leo Strauss, Hans Morgenthau and Raymond Aron.257 According to Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, who had met Weber during his time at the University of Vienna,

According to his friend, the psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers, Weber was &quot;the greatest German of our era&quot; and his untimely death felt to him &quot;as if the German world had lost its heart.&quot;258
Critical responses to Weber
Weber's explanations are highly specific to the historical periods he analysed.259 This makes it more difficult to generalise from his analysis and modify his theories for other circumstances.260
Further, many scholars have disagreed with specific claims Weber makes in his historical analysis. For example, the economist Joseph Schumpeter argued that capitalism did not begin with the Industrial Revolution but in 14th century Italy.261 In Milan, Venice and Florence the small city-state governments led to the development of the earliest forms of capitalism.262 In the 16th century Antwerp was a commercial centre of Europe. Also, the predominantly Calvinist country of Scotland did not enjoy the same economic growth as the Netherlands, England and New England. It has been pointed out that the Netherlands, which had a Calvinist majority, industrialised much later in the 19th century than predominantly Catholic Belgium, which was one of the centres of the Industrial Revolution on the European mainland.263 Emil Kauder expanded Schumpeter's argument by arguing the hypothesis that Calvinism hurt the development of capitalism by leading to the development of the labour theory of value.264

Notes
a  Weber wrote his books in German. Original titles printed after his death (1920) are most likely compilations of his unfinished works (of the 'Collected Essays...' form). Many translations are made of parts or sections of various German originals and the names of the translations often do not reveal what part of German work they contain. Weber's work is generally quoted according to the critical Gesamtausgabe (collected works edition), which is published by Mohr Siebeck in T&lt;U+00FC&gt;bingen. For an extensive list of Max Weber's works see list of Max Weber works.
