The Archaeological Museum of Nikopolis is a museum in Nicopolis, of the Preveza Prefecture in Greece.
History
Until the year 1940, the &lt;U+2018&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;Archaeological Museum of Preveza &lt;U+2013&gt; Nikopolis&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt; was located in an Ottoman mosque, in the city of Preveza, Greece. In the year 1940, the mosque was bombed by Italian aircraft and was partially destroyed. Some of the exhibits were stolen. After the Second World War, the mosque was demolished by the Greek state. In the year 1965 the state built a small Archaeological Museum inside the Byzantine walls of ancient Nikopolis. From 1998 to 2006 a new archaeological museum was built 5Â km North of Preveza,but it will not open until 2010.
