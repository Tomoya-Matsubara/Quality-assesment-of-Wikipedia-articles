The following is a list of Governors of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. As head of the executive branch of the state's government, the governor is given broad appointment power, and names many state commissioners and department heads without the need for legislative approval. The governor is also empowered to reorganize the state government or reduce it in size. He or she serves as commander-in-chief of the state's army, navy, and militia forces. Historically, the office has been regarded as one of the most powerful executive positions in the United States.
Fifty-six individuals have held the office of governor of Kentucky. Prior to a 1992 amendment to the state's constitution, the governor of Kentucky was prohibited from succeeding himself in office, though four men (Isaac Shelby, John L. Helm, James B. McCreary, and A. B. &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler) served multiple non-consecutive terms. Paul Patton, the first governor eligible for a second consecutive term under the amendment, won his reelection bid in 1999. James Garrard succeeded himself in 1800, before the constitutional provision existed.
William Goebel, who was elected to the office in the disputed election of 1899, remains the only governor of any U.S. state to die from assassination while in office. Martha Layne Collins, who held the office from 1983 to 1987, was the first woman to serve as governor of Kentucky and was only the third woman to serve as governor of any U.S. state who was not the wife or widow of a previous governor.
Ernie Fletcher is the current governor, having served since 2003. He lost his re-election bid to Steve Beshear, who will take office on December 11 2007.
Kentucky was part of Virginia until 1792; see List of Governors of Virginia for that period.

Notes

Confederate governors
 During the Civil War, a group of Confederate sympathizers met at the Russellville, Kentucky to form a Confederate government for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. While this government never successfully displaced the government in Frankfort, two men were elected governor of the Confederate government: George W. Johnson, who served from November 20 1861 to his death on April 8 1862 at the Battle of Shiloh, and, on Johnson's death, Richard Hawes, who served until the Confederate surrender on April 9 1865. The Confederate government disbanded shortly after the end of the war in 1865.
