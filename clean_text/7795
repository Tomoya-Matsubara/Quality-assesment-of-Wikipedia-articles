 
This is a list of seasons completed by the Appalachian State Mountaineers football team of the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). The Mountaineers fielded their first team in 1928 under Graydon Eggers1 and are currently coached by Jerry Moore. In 79 seasons, the Mountaineers have played over 800 games, appeared in 9 bowl games, and participated in the FCS (formerly I-AA) Playoffs a total of 15 times.2 Appalachian became the first team since the playoffs began in 1978 to win three straight national titles, accomplishing the feat in 2005, 2006, and 2007.345 Historically, Appalachian has had a successful football program, winning over 500 games. In 1931 the Mountaineers joined the North State Conference and finished in first place under coach C.B. Johnson.6 Kidd Brewer took over coaching duties of the Mountaineers from 1935 to 1938, winning another North State Conference championship. An All-American at Duke, Brewer's 1937 squad is best remembered for going unbeaten and unscored upon during the regular season, outscoring opponents 206-0 before losing a postseason game to the Golden Eagles of Southern Miss, 7-0.78
E.C. Duggins coached the Mountaineers from 1947-50 and again from 1952-55.9 Appalachian went to seven bowl games and won three North State Conference championships under Duggins.10 After three coaches during a five year span, the Mountaineers got back to their winning ways under Jim Duncan, who coached for five years, 1960 to 1964, and won 31 games.11 Appalachian left the Carolinas Conference after the 1967 season and played as an independent for three years. In 1971 Jim Brakefield was hired as head coach from Wofford.12 A year later, in 1972, Appalachian accepted an invitation into the Southern Conference. Brakefield is credited as overseeing the transition into the SoCon, and in 1975, he had his most successful season guiding the Mountaineers to wins over East Carolina, Wake Forest, and South Carolina.13
Appalachian won the first of eight Southern Conference championships in 1986 under Sparky Woods, who also led the Mountaineers into the playoffs for the first time.14 Another conference championship and playoff appearance followed in 1987. Woods won the Wallace Wade Coach of the Year Award three straight years in 1985, 1986, and 1987, becoming the only coach in SoCon history to do so.15 Jerry Moore became the 19th coach in Appalachian history in 1989. Moore is the winningest coach in SoCon history,16 and under his leadership the Mountaineers have won six Southern Conference championships and three FCS national championships. Appalachian has posted eighteen winning campaigns to go with one losing season during Moore's tenure.17
