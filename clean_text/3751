&quot;The Scientist&quot; is the seventh single from the English alternative rock band Coldplay and the second single to be released from their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head. The song was written collaboratively by all the bandmembers for the album. The song is built around a piano ballad, with lyrics about a man's desire to love and an apology. The song was released in the United Kingdom as the second single from A Rush of Blood to the Head and reached number ten in the UK Charts. It was released in the United States as the third single, and reached number eighteen on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks.
&quot;The Scientist&quot; received positive reviews. Critics complimented the song's piano ballad and falsetto. Several remixes of the track exist and its riff has been widely sampled. The single's music video won three MTV Music Video Awards, for the video's use of reverse narrative. The song is featured in the band's 2003 live album Live 2003.
Background
Chris Martin wrote &quot;The Scientist&quot; after listening to George Harrison's &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;.1 In an interview with Rolling Stone, Martin revealed that while working on the band's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, he knew that the album was missing something.2 One night, during a stay in Liverpool,3 Martin found an old piano, that, according to him, was out of 'tune'.4 He wanted to work on George Harrison's song &quot;Isn't It a Pity&quot;, but he couldn't manage to do so. When the song came to Martin, he asked that the recorder be turned on.5 He concludes with saying that he came across this chord sequence and noted that the chord was 'lovely'.6 Martin recorded the vocals and piano takes in a studio in Liverpool.7
Talking about the album, Martin said: &quot;That's just about girls. It's weird that whatever else is on your mind, whether it's the downfall of global economics or terrible environmental troubles, the thing that always gets you most is when you fancy someone.&quot;8
However, the inside cover to A Rush of Blood to the Head stated: &quot;The Scientist is Dan.&quot; 'Dan' refers to Dan Keeling, the A&amp;R man who signed the band to Parlophone.9
Music and lyrics



The song is a piano-driven ballad; the song also contains a piano riff. Chris Martin opens the song and is joined by the rest of the band after the first chorus. The song begins with a three-chord piano melody, with Martin singing the song. The track also includes a string arrangement.10 Towards the end of the song, an electric guitar can be heard.
The lyrics to the song allude to a man's powerlessness in the face of love.1112 The song implies that he wants to go &quot;back to the start&quot;.13 The first lines of the first verse emphasize in an apology: &quot;Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry, you don't know how lovely you are&quot;.14 The song's title also alludes to science in question in verse three: &quot;I was just guessing at numbers and figures/pulling the puzzles apart/questions of science, science and progress&quot;.15
Release
 Coldplay released &quot;The Scientist&quot; in Europe on 4 November 2002 as the album's second single. The single was pressed with two B-side's: &quot;1.36&quot; and &quot;I Ran Away&quot;.16 Across the US, while preparing for the song as the album's second release, the band's US label felt the song failed to &quot;provide enough of a blood rush for American listeners&quot;; instead, they released &quot;Clocks&quot; as the second single in the US.17 The single's cover, created by S&lt;U+00F8&gt;lve Sundsb&lt;U+00F8&gt;,1819 as with the album's and its other singles, features drummer Will Champion.

Reception
Critics were positive towards the song. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone, in his review of the album wrote: &quot;While the fantastic piano ballad 'The Scientist' is an overt sequel to 'Yellow' (&quot;Let's go back to the start&quot;) with a cataclysmic falsetto finale that could raise every hair on the back of your neck.&quot;29 Nick Southall of Stylus magazine wrote: &quot;The piano that chimes through 'The Scientist' is captured perfectly, the warm depression of each individual key caught rather than a shrill ringing as is so often the case.&quot;30 Ian Watson of NME wrote: &quot;'The Scientist' is a song inexorably linked with the endless night sky and the secret hopes and regrets of a hundred thousand strangers.&quot;31
The song was covered live by Aimee Mann and released on a special edition of her album Lost in Space.32 Natasha Bedingfield, Eamon and Avril Lavigne covered the song on Jo Whiley's Live Lounge radio show.333435 Also, Belinda Carlisle did a live rendition on the ITV1 reality show Hit Me Baby One More Time and Johnette Napolitano included the song on her album Scarred.3637 The British female quartet All Angels did a choral arrangement of the song on their album &quot;Into Paradise&quot; which was released in November 2007.38 The chords to this song are replicated by Sum 41.39 In addition, the television show MADtv did a parody of the video, called &quot;The Narcissist&quot;.40 The track was featured in the 2004 film Wicker Park.4142
Music video
The music video for &quot;The Scientist&quot; was very popular with its reverse narrative. The same concept was previously used for Spike Jonze's 1996 music video for The Pharcyde's &quot;Drop&quot;. This reverse style was first seen in the video for the song &quot;The Second Summer of Love&quot; by Scottish band Danny Wilson in 1989, and can also be seen in Enigma's &quot;Return to Innocence&quot;, Jack Johnson's video for &quot;Sitting, Waiting, Wishing&quot;, Dashboard Confessional's video for &quot;Don't Wait&quot;, Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; Knowles' video for &quot;Me, Myself and I&quot;, Modest Mouse's &quot;Little Motel&quot;, Alicia Keys's &quot;Like You'll Never See Me Again&quot;, and Mute Math's &quot;Typical&quot;. It took Chris Martin a month to learn to sing the song backwards.43
The video was filmed at various locations, including London and the Bourne Woods, Surrey before the first leg of the A Rush of Blood to the Head tour.44 It was directed by Jamie Thraves.45 The video premiered on 14 August 2002.46 The video itself depicts Martin walking in reverse through a city, out into the suburbs and eventually the woods, picking up various pieces of a suit as he goes. Upon arriving at his car, he 'gets in' and passes out as his girlfriend, laying on the ground in front of the car, is shown reversely flying out of the car. The car backs out of the woods and through a broken barrier, which mends itself upon the car's passing. As the video closes, they are shown driving back up the road.47 Irish actress Elaine Cassidy is also featured in the video.48
In 2003, &quot;The Scientist&quot; won multiple MTV Video Music Awards for Best Group Video, Best Direction, and Breakthrough Video.49 It was also nominated at the 2004 Grammy Awards for Best Short Form Music Video; but lost to Johnny Cash's video for &quot;Hurt&quot;, respectively.50
