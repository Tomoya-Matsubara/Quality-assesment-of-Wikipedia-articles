  Asgard is the second largest multi-ring structure (impact crater) on Jupiter's moon Callisto, measuring 1600 km in diameter.1 It is named after Asgard, the realm of the gods in Norse mythology. The central part of Asgard is dominated by the domed Doh impact crater.
A smaller multi-ring structure is superposed on the northern part of Asgard. It is called Utgard (also from Norse mythology) and measures ~600 km in diameter.2 Utgard is the fourth largest multi-ring feature on Callisto. A substantial part of the central region of Utgard is covered with deposits from the relatively young Burr crater.
