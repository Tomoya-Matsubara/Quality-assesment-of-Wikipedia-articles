 This list of tallest buildings in Tulsa ranks high-rises in the U.S. city of Tulsa, Oklahoma by height. The tallest building in Tulsa is currently the 52-story BOK Tower, which rises 667 feet (203 m) in downtown Tulsa.1 It is currently the tallest building in the state of Oklahoma, and also the tallest building in the five &quot;Plains states&quot; of the United States: Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Another notable Tulsa skyscraper is the Cityplex Tower, a part of the CityPlex Towers complex, which stands as the second-tallest building in the city and the state.2
The history of skyscrapers in Tulsa began with the construction of the Cosden Building in 1918, which is often regarded as the city's first skyscraper.34 Tulsa went through a large building boom in the 1920s, during which many Art Deco high-rises were constructed. The city then experienced a second, larger building boom that lasted from the early 1960s to the early 1980s, during which time the city saw the construction of the BOK Tower and the CityPlex Towers complex. Tulsa is currently the site of four skyscrapers that rise at least 500 feet (152 m) in height. Overall, the skyline of Tulsa is ranked (based upon existing and under construction buildings over 500 feet (152 m) tall) third in the South Central United States (after Houston and Dallas) and 20th in the United States, after New York City, Chicago, Miami, Houston, Los Angeles, Dallas, Atlanta, San Francisco, Boston, Las Vegas, Seattle, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Jersey City, Minneapolis, Denver, Detroit, Charlotte and Columbus.
There are currently no high-rise buildings under construction or approved for construction in Tulsa.5 A proposal to construct a 15-story Westin hotel, The Westin at Tulsa Garden Square,6 in downtown Tulsa is currently the only high-rise development taking place in the city.7 The most recently completed skyscraper in the city is the Mid-Continent Tower, completed in 1984.8
