The 1964 Tour de France was the 51st Tour de France, taking place June 22 to July 14, 1964. The total race distance was 22 stages over 4504 km, with riders averaging 35.419 km/h.1 Stages 3, 10 and 22 were all two part stages with one the first half being a regular stage and the second half being a team or individual time trial. It was the only Tour de France to include a mid-stage climb to the L'Alpe D'Huez ski resort. The race was eventually won by Jacques Anquetil following an epic shoulder to shoulder battle with Raymond Poulidor during Stage 20.
Participants
Jacques Anquetil had won the 1964 Giro d'Italia earlier that year, and was trying to win a Tour-Giro double, which at that moment had only been done by Fausto Coppi.2
Race details
Anquetil, who was looking for his fifth Tour victory, was superior in the time trials, which he both won. But Raymond Poulidor dominated in the mountains, and Anquetil was close to losing.
In the second part of the tenth stage, the time trial, Anquetil won, but he was helped by Poulidor flatting.3
In the rest day between the thirteenth and the fourteenth stage, Anquetil had joined a lamb barbecue, and in the fourteenth stage he was immediately dropped. His team director gave him a bottle of champagne, which washed away the indigestion, and then Anquetil was able to get back to Poulidor.4
In the twentieth stage, Poulidor did not have the right bicycle for the climb, but did not tell it to his team director. Poulidor dropped Anquetil in the climb, but the margin was not big enough for him to take over the lead, and Anquetil remained leader of the race by 14 seconds. In the final time trial, Anquetil improved that margin some more, and won the Tour by only 55 seconds,5 which was at that moment the smallest margin in history.6
