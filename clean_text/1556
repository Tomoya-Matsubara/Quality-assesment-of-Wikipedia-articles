Development
Characterisation and Audrey Roberts
Gareth McLean of the Radio Times revealed Lewis was a gentleman escort and he deemed him a &quot;suave companion.&quot;9 A show spokeswoman said that there is no suggestion that Lewis is anything more than a companion for his clients.10 A writer for the Metro described Lewis as &quot;charming&quot; and &quot;charismatic&quot;, while a reporter from the Daily Record said he was &quot;Weatherfield's answer to American Gigolo.&quot;1112 Havers believed Lewis would display &quot;a real dark side&quot;, though he was unaware of what that was.13 Lewis is first seen accompanying Claudia Colby (Rula Lenska) to a Christmas ball.14 He is introduced to Audrey Roberts and Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy said she was &quot;immediately bowled over by his charming ways.&quot;15 Claudia informs Audrey that she booked Lewis through an agency and Audrey decides to hire Lewis to be her companion to another event.16 Lewis goes to the Rovers Return Inn and pretends not to know Audrey.17 He then proceeds to chat her up in front of her friends, causing them to wonder how she attracted him.18 Havers said the scenes were funny and called the storyline between Lewis and Audrey fantastic.19 In March 2010, Lewis was seen advertising his escort service in society magazine, The Lady.20 A reporter for the The Belfast Telegraph said the character's classified advert would then be seen in the real life magazine in a crossover with the show.21 A spokeswoman for Coronation Street said &quot;The Lady heard the magazine was going to feature in an episode, and they approached us with the idea of using the advert in the actual magazine.&quot;22 In the advert, Lewis claimed to have &quot;years of experience&quot; and was &quot;suitable to accompany ladies in any social or corporate event&quot;, two fictional phone numbers were also included.23 In the show, Audrey's friend Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) notices the advert and books Lewis for a date.24  A love triangle storyline between Audrey, Rita and Lewis then formed and played out over Easter 2010.25 Rita hires Lewis to accompany her to a ball, despite knowing that Audrey has fallen for him.26 Audrey becomes jealous when she tries to book Lewis herself and he explains someone has already hired him.27 Audrey attends the ball with a friend and is shocked to see Rita with Lewis. The two woman insult each other and Lewis and Rita leave.28 Susan Hill, writing for the Daily Star said despite Lewis' apology for attending an event with Rita, Audrey is furious and confronts her friend.29 Rita tells Audrey she is &quot;acting like an old fool as Lewis can never be hers&quot; and Audrey slaps Rita across the face.30 Of Lewis' take on the situation, Havers commented &quot;I think Lewis is genuinely concerned about Audrey. When Rita gets involved, he has to box clever, but he's very good at that. Things move on, but I don't want to give anything away. Put it like this - all is not what it seems.&quot;31 Audrey decides to stop all contact with Lewis after realising she has fallen for him. 32 Audrey's decision is prompted by her falling out with Rita and the fact she has read Lewis' diary, which contains details on his clients.33 Not wanting to get hurt by him, Audrey tells Lewis that she wants end their arrangment. Lewis is shocked and cannot understand why Audrey would want to stop seeing him.34 A show spokesperson said &quot;In the end she has to come clean and tell him how she really feels &lt;U+2013&gt; which prompts Lewis to kiss her. He then tells her he&lt;U+2019&gt;s developed feelings for her too.&quot;35 Audrey is shocked by the kiss and Lewis' declaration of love.36
As their relationship progresses, Audrey invites Lewis to move in with her. Nicholls told Suzanne Byrne of RT&lt;U+00C9&gt; Ten that Lewis appears to brush Audrey off, before eventually agreeing to move in.37 Nicholls said &quot;And then in his usual charming style he brings her breakfast in bed on her birthday, which she adores him for. He's clever like that, he knows how to bring the balance back to the relationship.&quot;38 In May 2010, Brian Roberts of the Daily Mirror reported Audrey and Lewis would leave Weatherfield together for a new life in Greece.39 The couple visit a Greek island on holiday and they plan to purchase a hotel out there.4041 Nicholls said Audrey is taken with Lewis' &quot;romantic&quot; idea of opening a hotel and living a glamorous life.42 Roberts likened the plot development to the 1989 film, Shirley Valentine.43 Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury noted that Lewis seemed uncomfortable with the plan, while Nicholls said Audrey is unaware that he is having doubts.4445 Laws also compared the plot to a similar one involving Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen) and Charlie Haynes (George Costigan) in Emmerdale, predicting both storylines would end in heartache.46 Nicholls stated that she wanted Audrey and Lewis to leave together and have a happy ending. She also revealed that she would have liked to have seen a spin-off focusing on the two characters and their new life in Greece.47

Havers filmed his final scenes on 21 June 2010 at a Manchester hotel, which doubled for an airport bar.54 While he is at the airport, Lewis meets businesswoman, Lydia Radcliffe (Lysette Anthony).55 Chris Johnson of the Daily Mail said Lydia is a welcome distraction for Lewis who is feeling guilty about robbing Peter and leaving Audrey.56 Lewis begins flirting with Lydia and &quot;rolls out some of his well-known chat-up lines&quot;, which she falls for.57 Lydia mentions she is heading to Barbados and Lewis reveals he is going there too. They then board the plane together.58 Lewis departed on 13 August 2010.59

And if I said that Gail is angry when they bump into Lewis, it would be a massive understatement!&quot;68 Lewis begs Audrey and Gail not to call the police and he decides to return to Weatherfield.69
Havers deemed Lewis a changed man and said he wants to apologise and make amends with those that he hurt.70 Lewis returns the money he took to Peter and he adds a thousand pounds to the amount as compensation.

The actor said he believed Lewis did fall for her while they were together and that it why he did not take her money.73 Havers added &quot;There's always that danger Lewis could fall back into his old ways, and he is down to his last penny. But at the moment, Lewis is trying his hardest and has no ulterior motive - just an awful lot of ice to break instead!&quot;74 Havers will make his return to Coronation Street as Lewis on 17 February 2012.75

Reception
Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail called Havers' casting &quot;inspired&quot;, saying he had become &quot;synonymous with upper-class cads&quot; following his role as Ralph Ernest Gorse in The Charmer.76 Of the character, Stephen said &quot;It's not often that someone like Lewis strays onto the cobbles. Suave and charming, he's in a different class to Jack Sugden and co. Although at least none of Weatherfield's men folk have charged ladies for their company, as, despite his plummy veneer, Lewis is just a gigolo.&quot;77 A writer for the Liverpool Daily Post said &quot;Since Lewis (Nigel Havers) waltzed into the street, things with the over fifty club (Rita, Audrey and now Deirdre) haven't been the same.&quot;78 Steve Pratt, writing for The Northern Echo, said &quot;As love rat scumbags go, Lewis Archer is up there with that chap who tried to push Rita under a tram in Blackpool.79
Sue Crawford of the Daily Mirror said &quot;playing a ladies' man comes naturally to Nigel Havers so it's hardly surprising he's playing a flirt in Coronation Street.&quot;80 Crawford's colleague, Simon Boyle, branded Lewis &quot;charming but devious.&quot;81 Havers' turn in the soap proved popular with female viewers. The actor told entertainment website Digital Spy that he had been sent sackfuls of fan mail and underwear.82 However, other viewers were unhappy with his character's treatment of Audrey and the actor received abuse in the street.83 In November 2011, Jon Horsley of Yahoo! said viewers should be excited about Lewis' return to Coronation Street.84 Horsely added &quot;It'll be great to see the old smoothy back on the cobbles. We're really looking forward to Audrey's reaction to him, too.&quot;85
