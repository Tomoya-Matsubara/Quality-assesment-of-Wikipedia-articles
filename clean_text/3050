Critical reception
 Colin McGuire of Pop Matters said that &quot;The piano-balladry of 'Broken-Hearted Girl' is simply more Celine Dion than Aretha Franklin&quot;.16 Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond of Village Voice called the song &quot;romantic-comedy soundtrack fare&quot;.17 Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News complimented the song's domination of piano and strings and stated &quot;Her voice shows restraint, and singing in a lower register gives her more vocal power&quot;.18 Digital Spy's Nick Levine gave the single a mixed review, commending the use of piano and strings, but criticizing the drums sounds. He praised Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s &quot;emotion-filled vocals&quot;, but noted it does not compare to her earlier songs &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and &quot;If I Were a Boy&quot;, and singles from Destiny's Child's &quot;still-peerless&quot; Writing's on the Wall and Survivor.19
