History
Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds was founded in 1985 by Elliot Grassiano. For the first 10 years, Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds was a development house, but in 1995 they expanded into publishing and distribution as well.1 Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds France at this time was located in V&lt;U+00E9&gt;lizy (near Paris), France. The company also then expanded worldwide with a publisher in Milan, Italy (Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds Italy), distributor in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom (Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds Ltd) and a developer in Montr&lt;U+00E9&gt;al, Canada (Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds Canada Inc.).
MC2 France

In 2003, Emmanuel Olivier (founder of Index+) created a new company called MC2 France which subsequently merged with Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds. In September 2003 MC2-Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds acquired Wanadoo Edition as part of a deal with the French government for Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds to emerge from bankruptcy protection. As part of the deal, Wanadoo also became a 12% shareholder of Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds.2 Emmanuel Olivier became CEO when Elliot Grassiano left the company.
In March 2005 Ubisoft announced their intention to acquire MC2-Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds (Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds Canada) and to integrate it into Ubisoft's Montreal studios.3 This deal only included fifty of MC2-Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds' employees and technical equipment; however, the agreement did not include any transfer of intellectual property.4 Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds Italy split off from the company in 2005, turning into the Italian publisher Blue Label Entertainment.5
On November 28, 2007 MC2 France officially relaunched the Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds brand6, with all of the company's future productions to be released either under the MICRO&lt;U+00CF&gt;DS Montreal or MICRO&lt;U+00CF&gt;DS Paris brands. The headquarters of the company are in Montrouge a suburb of Paris and they have a development studio in Montreal, Canada, hence the two brands. In December 2007 they opened an online store, powered by Metaboli.
On 20 October 2008 Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds acquired the brands and intellectual property of Cryo Interactive, who had been declared bankrupt in 2002.7 On 5 November the Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds online store was improved and relaunched.8
Anuman Interactive
On 23 November 2009 Anuman Interactive announced that they were acquiring the mark of and all the associated licences of Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds.9 The Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds deal between Anuman and MC2 was completed on 1 January 2010.1011

Corporate identity
  Since the creation of Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds in 1984 the company has had a number of different logos, utilising two main designs. There is the original curvy stylised letter M logo, which may look like a simple drawing of a bird; initially this had a background depicting a 3D scene.17 Fellow French video game developer with links to Micro&lt;U+00EF&gt;ds, White Birds, also use similar simple drawings of birds as their logo. In the mid-1990s the company changed their logo slightly to contain the colours of the rainbow, but without a background. This logo remained until the merger with MC2 France, when a red/grey logo was used. By the time of Still Life being released the company was using a logo containing a blocky stylised letter M and dot below it.18 In 2005 this had a smooth typeface and no dots above the letter i. By the relaunch of the brand in 2007 the stylised M logo had dots placed above the letter i and a different typeface.19
