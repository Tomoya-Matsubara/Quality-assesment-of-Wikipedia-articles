Drinsey Nook is a small village in the West Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England, about  south west of Saxilby, close to the county border with Nottinghamshire.
It is most notable for the case of Tom Otter, a man who murdered his new wife in 1805. Tom Otter lane is the B1190 running south of the village, and Tom Otters bridge is named after the site of the murder.1
The story says that Tom Otter, reputedly from Treswell, was already a married man when he married his new wife, Mary, whom he murdered the same day, near the bridge that now bears his name. He hung in 1806, and was held in a Gibbet post by Gibbet Wood.2
