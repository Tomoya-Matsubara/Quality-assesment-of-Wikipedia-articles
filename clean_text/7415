Manufactured by Intaride (a subsidiary of Intamin), the ride reaches a maximum height of  making it North America's tallest free-standing drop tower. It is also the first drop tower to use 90-degree tilting seats (facing riders straight down). Riders experience about five seconds of free fall, reaching a speed of . The ride's name was chosen to invoke a falcon's ability to dive steeply at high speed to capture prey.3
The project was originally planned to start in 2012 and open to the public in 2013, but was delayed one year. Construction began in 2013, with a scheduled opening date of May 1, 2014, but the opening was delayed due to mechanical and technical issues. Falcon's Fury opened to park employees in August before a soft opening on August 16 and an official opening on September 2. Public response to the ride has been positive, praising the height of the tower and the drop experience.
History
 Planning for Falcon's Fury began around the time the park completed its Cheetah Hunt ride in 2011.45 Ground tests in the Timbuktu area (currently known as Pantopia)6 revealed &quot;interesting soil conditions&quot;, with steel beams and concrete required to reinforce the site.7
Rumors that Busch Gardens Tampa might replace its Sandstorm ride with a  drop tower surfaced in the fall of 2011 when its sister park, Busch Gardens Williamsburg, opened M&lt;U+00E4&gt;ch Tower that August.89 Construction surveying was observed in January 2012.10 Two months later plans were filed with the city to build a drop tower, possibly for the 2013 season.11 Speculation about the new attraction's name began when SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment, owners of Busch Gardens Tampa,12 filed trademark applications for &quot;Desert Dive&quot; and &quot;Falcon's Fury&quot; on May 2 and July 11, 2012, respectively, and bought the DesertDive.com domain name.131415 When permits for the new ride differed from those for M&lt;U+00E4&gt;ch Tower in November 2012, rumors began that the seats would tilt forward.1617 Due to the height of the attraction, approval from the Federal Aviation Administration was required. According to the FAA and the city of Tampa, the tower was supposed to be built in December 2012 and open to the public in 2013. For unknown reasons the project was delayed, with its construction pushed back to the second half of 2013.181920
On May 31, 2013, it was announced that Sandstorm would close on June 2 to make room for a new attraction.21 About two weeks later, on June 11, Busch Gardens Tampa announced plans for Falcon's Fury222324 and construction began that month.25 During the fourth quarter of 2013, the park drove steel piles for the ride's foundation nightly for about a month.26
On September 20 the tower for Falcon's Fury was shipped from Spain in nine sections, arriving at the park near the end of October; the ride's smaller parts had been delivered earlier from several European countries.2728 Installation of one of the nine tower pieces was planned for every other night, with the last piece in place by New Year's Eve.29 Construction was done by the Adena Corporation, and on November 18 the first piece was installed.3031 The ride's second piece was installed on December 2, and two more were installed by December 6.323334 The fifth section was placed by December 21, and the sixth was erected by New Year's Day.3536 The seventh tower piece was installed by January 3, 2014 and the eighth by January 5, reaching a height of about ,373839 and Falcon's Fury's gondola was seen at the park on January 12.40 The ride's counterweight was installed on January 22, and the tower was capped during the weekend of February 1.4142 Work on the ride's electrical components then began.43 Assembly of the gondola was completed by the end of March.44 Testing was originally scheduled to begin in February, but due to construction delays the first drop tests were not made until April 15.454647 Tower painting began in June, with its sunset motif estimated to take 60 hours over a three-week period.4849
At the end of February, Busch Gardens Tampa announced that Falcon's Fury would open on May 1,5051 and on April 3 the park began a sweepstakes contest for its &quot;Falcon's Fury First-to-Ride Party&quot;. A second, similar contest began on April 11, with fifty winners from each contest being among the first riders.525354 A week later, the park announced that the ride's opening would be delayed, and several media events scheduled for April and May (including the First-to-Ride party) were cancelled.555657 It was later disclosed that the delay was due to manufacturing and technical issues with the cables which pull the gondola up the tower.585960 During the week of August 10, Falcon's Fury opened for park employees.61 On August 16 the ride soft-opened to the public, and two-and-a-half weeks later Falcon's Fury officially opened.626364
Ride experience
Falcon's Fury has two shaded queue lines: a standby line which can hold guests for about 45 minutes, and a Quick Queue for guests with passes that allows them to bypass the standby line.6566 Although the Quick Queue system will not initially be used for the ride, it may be added later.6768 Riders must be between  and .6970
When the riders are seated a catch car connects to the gondola and raises it to the top of the tower, which takes about one minute.7172 Although the tower is  high, the gondola stops  lower. When it reaches the maximum height the seats tilt forward 90 degrees, facing the riders straight down, with a computer-randomized wait time from one to five seconds. When the wait time ends, the gondola is released from the catch car into a five-second free fall reaching a maximum speed of .737475 As the gondola passes through the pre-braking section, the seats rotate back into a horizontal position. After the pre-brake the gondola enters the main magnetic-brake run, where riders experience approximately 3.5 Gs as the gondola slows.767778 When it comes to a full stop at the base of the tower, the riders disembark. One cycle of the ride lasts about one and a half minutes.7980 Also, Busch Gardens Tampa placed an Easter egg in the form of a painted Falcon's Fury logo on top of one of its buildings, which can be seen only from a certain side of the gondola.81
Characteristics
The tower and gondola were manufactured by Intaride, a subsidiary of Intamin.82 The ride covers an area of about .83
Tower
The Falcon's Fury tower is  tall, the tallest free-standing drop tower in North America, and can bend  in any direction from the top to withstand hurricane-force winds.848586 The tower is composed of nine sections, including the machine house.87 Each piece of the tower weighs up to , and the entire structure weighs about .8889 The  machine house at the top contains four DC motors used to lift the gondola.90 Inside the tower is a  counterweight, composed of hundreds of lead weights, to help raise the gondola.91 The tower's foundation is made up of 105 steel piles, varying in depth from  to .9293 A  eddy current brake system on the tower slows the gondola after its free fall.949596 The structure is painted yellow, aqua and two shades of red.97
Gondola
 The ride's single gondola has 32 seats, grouped octagonally around the tower. Each of the eight sides seats four riders, and each seat has an over-the-shoulder restraint and seat belt.9899100 Falcon's Fury can theoretically accommodate 800 riders per hour.101 Carbon-fiber wings buttress each end of a group of seats, protecting outside riders' arms and legs during the drop. The gondola reaches a height of ,  below the top of the tower. When it reaches its maximum height the seats tilt 90 degrees forward, with the riders facing the ground (the first use of this feature on a drop tower).102103104
Records
When Falcon's Fury opened it became North America's tallest free-standing drop tower.105 Although taller drop towers exist on the continent&lt;U+2014&gt;such as Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom at Six Flags Magic Mountain and Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom at Six Flags Great Adventure, which reach drop heights of  and  respectively&lt;U+2014&gt;those attractions were added to existing structures.106107108 Despite its height, the ride's maximum speed of  does not set a speed record. Other drop towers&lt;U+2014&gt;such as Drop Tower at Kings Dominion, which reaches 109110&lt;U+2014&gt;are faster. However, Falcon's Fury is the world's first drop tower whose seats tilt 90 degrees.111 Although tilting seats were first used by Intamin in 2001 on Acrophobia at Six Flags Over Georgia, their tilt angle is smaller.112113114
Reception
The initial reception after the ride's announcement was positive. According to Lance Hart, a theme park enthusiast from Screamscape, &quot;Instead of selling your picture [&lt;U+2026&gt;] they should sell baby wipes and clean underwear at the exit&quot; and the ride could be the most frightening drop tower in the world.115116117 Robb Alvey of Theme Park Review called the ride the world's best drop tower, later ranking it one of the top 14 new attractions for 2014;118119 Dave Parfitt and Arthur Levine of USA Today ranked Falcon's Fury in their top ten.120121 Brady MacDonald of the Los Angeles Times originally ranked Falcon's Fury his seventh-most-anticipated ride for 2014; on an updated list, he ranked it 17th.122123
For safety reasons, construction on Falcon's Fury was done primarily at night. Residents near the park complained about noise from the pile driver during the laying of the foundation, and complaints about the ride's operating noise continued into August 2014.124125
According to the park and Twitter posts selected by news media, public response during the soft opening was positive;126127128 Total Orlando gave the ride five stars for teenagers and four stars for adults.129 On Coaster101.com &quot;Ashley&quot; said that although the restraints were tight, they were comfortable and not as tight as those on other rides, adding: &quot;The drop on Falcon's Fury is different from any ride I have ever ridden. The best way I can describe it is that instead of leaving your stomach at the top of the tower, you take it with you to the bottom.&quot;130 According to Florida Trip Guides, the ride was a good addition to the park's attraction lineup: &quot;Falcon's Fury is not for the faint of heart. I have ridden dozens of drop towers but this one is different. Something about facing straight down and falling really makes you nervous.&quot;131 Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider said that Falcon's Fury and other recent attractions were nearing human tolerances; as a result, &quot;You're getting to the point where instead of making an attraction more popular by having it achieve some type of record, you're actually tolerances the audience for that.&quot;132 Randi Nissenbaum of Bay News 9 called the view from the top of the tower incredible, and although she was nervous at first she wanted to ride again.133 Sue Carlton of the Tampa Bay Times said, &quot; ...it was terrifying and thrilling and I held on as hard as I could and yelled and closed my eyes and afterward stepped off rubber-kneed and exhilarated.&quot;134
For the 2014 season, Busch Gardens Tampa expected attendance to increase by three to eight percent. However (as predicted in June 2014 by IBISWorld Research), combined attendance for the second quarter of the year increased by about 0.3 percent for SeaWorld Orlando, SeaWorld San Diego, SeaWorld San Antonio, Busch Gardens Williamsburg and Busch Gardens Tampa. Compared to the same period in 2013, combined attendance for the first half of the year dropped by just over four percent. Busch Gardens Tampa blamed the lack of its anticipated attendance increase partially on the Falcon's Fury delays.135136137138139
