Professional wrestling career
Training
While growing up in Calgary, Sing attended numerous Stampede Wrestling events with her mother.2 She knew she wanted to be a wrestler from a young age and frequently beat up the neighborhood children.3 As a teenager, Sing approached members of the Hart wrestling family and asked to be trained, but she was rejected as they did not train women wrestlers at the time.4 Bret Hart, however, claims it had more to do with scheduling conflicts.5 During a trip to Hawaii in 1978, she saw Japanese women's wrestling on television and decided she wanted to pursue the sport.6 She later wrote Mildred Burke, after a friend gave her a magazine with Burke's contact information,7 and sent her a biography and photo.8 Shortly thereafter, she joined Burke's training facility in Encino, California.9
Japan, Canada, and Puerto Rico
After a few weeks of training with Burke, Sing was scouted by All Japan Women (AJW), despite her inexperience.1011 Sing's debut match in Japan was a tag team match with partner Mami Komeni, defeating the Beauty Pair (Jackie Sato and Maki Ueda) in January 1979.1213 In Japan, she began wrestling under the name Monster Ripper.14 Although she found adjusting to the Japanese culture difficult, Sing held AJW's title on two occasions and was the first Calgary born wrestler to gain success in Japan.1516 During her time in the company, the Japanese female wrestlers gave her a hard time because they did not like losing to foreigners.1718 Sing also had difficulty because of her youth and inexperience in the ring.19 Sing, however, was comforted by New Japan Pro Wrestling's Dynamite Kid, who had also trained in Calgary.2021 Sing won the WWWA World Heavyweight Championship from Jackie Sato on July 31, 1979.22 Despite losing the title to Sato six weeks later, she regained it on March 15, 1980.23 The title was vacated in August 1980.24
After another stint in Japan, Sing returned to Stampede Wrestling in late 1987 and was renamed Rhonda Singh by Stu Hart, the owner of the company.25 There were plans to pair her with Gama Singh, but they never came to fruition.26 During 1987, she was named their first Women's Champion because she had defeated Wendi Richter prior to returning to Stampede.2728 She held the title until September 22, 1988, when she lost to Chigusa Nagayo.29
Over the next few years, Sing once again traveled throughout the world and wrestled for a number of companies, holding several titles. Between 1987 and 1990, Sing worked in Puerto Rico for the World Wrestling Council (WWC), where she held the WWC Women's Championship on five separate occasions by defeating Wendi Richter, Candi Devine, and Sasha in matches for the title.30
United States
In 1995, Sing was contacted by the World Wrestling Federation to help their fledgling women's division.31 She, however, was repackaged as Bertha Faye, a comedic character who lived in a trailer park and dated Harvey Wippleman.3233 WWF management originally wanted her to have a on-screen feud with Bull Nakano, but there was a change of plans after Nakano was charged with cocaine possession.34 Sing made her WWF debut on the April 3, 1995 episode of Monday Night Raw participating in a sneak attack on Alundra Blayze, making it appear as if Blayze's nose had been broken.35 At SummerSlam, Faye defeated Blayze for the WWF Women's Championship and held the title until the October 23, 1995 airing of Monday Night Raw, where Blayze regained the title.3637 Fan interest in women's wrestling sunk once again as the year closed, and Sing tired of working there.38 Moreover, Faye was frustrated with her gimmick.39 WWF management asked her not to perform the same power moves as the male wrestlers, so instead, Faye was forced to act as comic relief.4041 After a year with the company, Sing asked for a release from her contract.42 She briefly returned to Japan, but did not like the new system, which did not guarantee payouts.43
In late 1999 and early 2000, she worked with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) briefly and appeared on several telecasts to help generate interest in a women's division.44 She was also a contender for both the WCW Cruiserweight Championship and WCW Hardcore Championship. In addition to competing in matches using her Singh and Monster Ripper gimmicks, she also made a couple appearances with the Nitro Girls dance troupe as &quot;Nitro Girl Beef&quot; as comedic relief.4546
Personal life
Backstage, Sing was friends with the male wrestlers.47 During her time in the WWF, she developed a close friendship with Owen Hart.48
After leaving WCW, Sing took a break from wrestling.49 In 2001, Sing worked as a caregiver to the handicapped.50 She died on July 27, 2001 as a result of undisclosed medical problems.5152 Other sources indicate that it may have been a suicide.5354 Sing was never married nor had any children.
