Artistry
Influences

During the early stages of her career, Perry's musical style gravitated towards gospel and she aspired to be as successful as Amy Grant.150 At the age of 15, she heard Queen's &quot;Killer Queen&quot; and has described it as being the song that inspired her to pursue a career in music.151 She cites the band's frontman, Freddie Mercury, as her biggest influence and expressed how the &quot;combination of his sarcastic approach to writing lyrics and his 'I don't give a fuck' attitude&quot; inspired her music.152 She paid homage to the band by naming her third fragrance Killer Queen. Perry described The Beach Boys and their album Pet Sounds as having a considerable influence on her music: &quot;[It] is one of my favorite records and it influenced pretty much all of my songwriting. All of the melody choices that I make are because of [it].&quot;153 The singer also holds the Beatles' album The Beatles in high esteem, and described these two albums as &quot;the only things I listened to for probably two years straight.&quot;154
Perry cites Alanis Morissette and her 1995 album Jagged Little Pill as a significant musical inspiration, and opted to work with Morissette's frequent collaborator Ballard as a result. Perry stated, &quot;Jagged Little Pill was the most perfect female record ever made. There's a song for anyone on that record; I relate to all those songs. They're still so timeless.&quot; Additionally, Perry borrows influence from Flaming Red by Patty Griffin and 10 Cent Wings by Jonatha Brooke.155 Perry intends to become &quot;more of a Joni Mitchell&quot;, releasing folk and acoustic music.156 Perry's autobiographical documentary Katy Perry: Part of Me was largely influenced by Madonna: Truth or Dare. She admires Madonna's ability to reinvent herself, saying &quot;I want to evolve like Madonna.&quot;157
Perry has listed multiple artists as having inspired her work. She names Gwen Stefani and Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk as influences, particularly admiring Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk's &quot;willingness to always be taking chances&quot;.158 &quot;Firework&quot; was inspired by a passage in the book On the Road by Jack Kerouac in which the author compares people who are full of life to fireworks that shoot across the sky and make people go &quot;Awww!&quot;.159 Her second concert tour, the California Dreams Tour, was reminiscent of Alice In Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz.160 She also credits the 1996 movie The Craft for being the influence behind her song &quot;Dark Horse&quot;,161 and Eckhart Tolle's book The Power of Now for influencing Prism.162
Musical style and themes

While Perry's music incorporates pop, rock, and disco, Katy Hudson contains gospel. Her subsequent releases, One of the Boys and Teenage Dream, involve themes of sex and love. One of the Boys is a pop rock record, while Teenage Dream features disco influences.163164165166 Perry's fourth album, Prism, is significantly influenced by dance and pop music. Lyrically, the album addresses relationships, self-reflection, and everyday life.167 Many of her songs, particularly on Teenage Dream, reflect on love between teenagers; W described them as &quot;odes to adolescent lust wrapped up in irresistible hook-laden melodies&quot;.168 Self-empowerment is a common theme in Perry's music.169
Perry identifies as a &quot;singer-songwriter masquerading as a pop star&quot;170 and maintains that honest songwriting is very important to her. She told Marie Claire: &quot;I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think you become more relatable when you're vulnerable.&quot;171 Kristen Wiig commented that &quot;as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record.&quot;172 According to Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune, &quot;being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet.&quot;173 The New York Times labeled her &quot;the most potent pop star of the day &lt;U+2013&gt; her hits are relatable with just a hint of experimentation&quot;.174 Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent &quot;clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;s&quot;.175 Throughout her career, Perry has co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Selena Gomez &amp; the Scene,176177 Jessie James,178 Kelly Clarkson,179 Lesley Roy,180 Britney Spears,181 and Iggy Azalea.182
Perry has a contralto vocal range.183184 Her singing has received both praise and criticism; Betty Clarke of The Guardian commented that her &quot;powerful voice is hard-edged&quot;185 while Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone described Perry's vocals on Teenage Dream as &quot;processed staccato blips&quot;.186 Darren Harvey of musicOMH compared Perry's vocals on One of the Boys to Alanis Morissette's, both possessing a &quot;perky voice shifting octaves mid-syllable&quot;.187 Alex Miller from NME felt that on One of the Boys &quot;Perry's problem is often her voice&quot;, stating that &quot;somewhere along the line someone convinced her she was like, well, a ballsy rock chick&quot;.188 Conversely, Bernadette McNulty from The Daily Telegraph praised her &quot;rock chick voice&quot; in a review of a concert promoting Prism.189

We'll just shake our heads in disbelief, saying, 'Thank God we've evolved.' That would be my prayer for the future.&quot;225 In December 2012, Perry was awarded the Trevor Hero Award by The Trevor Project for her work and activism on behalf of LGBT youth.226 She identifies as a feminist,227 and appeared in April 2013 in a video clip for the &quot;Chime For Change&quot; campaign that aims to spread female empowerment.228 She has also said that America's lack of free health care drove her &quot;absolutely crazy&quot;.229
