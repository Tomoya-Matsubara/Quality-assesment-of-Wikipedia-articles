Tyler Heath Slocum (born February 3, 1974) is an American professional golfer and current player on the PGA Tour.
Slocum was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He learned the game of golf from his dad, a former Mississippi club pro who participated in the Magnolia State Classic nine times. Slocum played on the same high school golf team in Milton, Florida as fellow PGA Tour player Boo Weekley, and later attended the University of South Alabama in Mobile, Alabama. While a student there, he earned many amateur golf honors including three-time All-American. He turned pro in 1996 and joined the PGA Tour in 2001.
Slocum began his career on the Nationwide Tour. He was the second person to earn a promotion to the PGA Tour by winning three Nationwide Tour events in the same season (this is commonly referred to as a &quot;battlefield promotion&quot;). He is only the second player in Nationwide Tour history to complete 72 holes without a bogey. In November 1997, Slocum developed ulcerative colitis which caused his weight to drop from 150 pounds to 122 pounds. He wasn't able to play for a year and one-half.
Slocum has won twice so far on the PGA Tour. His first win was in 2004 at the Chrysler Classic of Tucson. His second win came at the Southern Farm Bureau Classic in 2005. His best finish in a major has been a 22nd at the 2002 PGA Championship and he has featured in the top 100 of the Official World Golf Rankings. Slocum represented the United States at the 2007 OMEGA Mission Hills World Cup with Boo Weekley and finished in 2nd place.
