Juno is a NASA mission to the planet Jupiter, and it is part of the New Frontiers Program. It is slated to cost about USD $700 million (FY03) and scheduled to launch in August 2011.1 As of September 2008, the mission is in the early planning stages. The Atlas V rocket has been chosen to launch Juno in the Atlas V-551 configuration.
The spacecraft will be placed in a polar orbit to study the planet's composition, gravity field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere. Juno will also search for clues about how Jupiter formed, including whether the planet has a rocky core, the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere, and how the mass is distributed within the planet. Juno will also study Jupiter's deep winds, which can reach speeds of 600 km/h.
Mission summary
Juno's trajectory will use a gravity assist speed boost from Earth, accomplished through an Earth flyby two years after its 2011 launch. In 2016, the spacecraft will perform an orbit insertion burn to slow the spacecraft enough to allow capture into an 11-day polar orbit. Once Juno enters into its orbit, infrared and microwave instruments will begin to measure the thermal radiation emanating from deep within Jupiter's atmosphere. These observations will complement previous studies of the planet's composition by assessing the abundance and distribution of water, and therefore oxygen. While filling missing pieces of the puzzle of Jupiter's composition, this data also provides insight into the planet's origins. Juno will also investigate the convection that drives general circulation patterns in Jupiter's atmosphere. Meanwhile, other instruments aboard Juno will gather data about the planet's gravitational field and polar magnetosphere.2
The Juno mission will conclude in 2017, after 32 orbits around Jupiter. Data analysis may occur during 2018.
Scientific objectives
The Juno spacecraft's suite of seven science instruments will determine:

The ratio of oxygen to hydrogen, giving an idea of the abundance of water on Jupiter.
Obtain a better estimate of Jupiter's core mass, which will help distinguish among prevailing theories linking the gas giant's formation to the solar system.
Precisely map Jupiter's gravitational and magnetic fields to assess the distribution of mass in Jupiter's interior, including properties of the planet's structure and dynamics.
Map the variation in atmospheric composition, temperature structure, cloud opacity and dynamics to depths far greater than 100 bars at all latitudes.
Characterize and explore the three dimensional structure of Jupiter's polar magnetosphere and its auroras.3

The team
Dr. Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas is the Principal Investigator. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California manages the mission and Lockheed Martin Corporation is responsible for the spacecraft development. University of Wisconsin-Madison leads the Juno Education and Public Outreach Program.4
Proposed scientific instruments
  The Juno mission's science objectives will be achieved with a payload of seven instruments onboard the spacecraft:5

Microwave Radiometer (MWR)
Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM)
Advanced Stellar Compass (ASC)
Jovian Auroral Distribution Experiment (JADE)
Energetic Particle Detector Instrument(JEDI)
Radio and Plasma Wave Sensor(WAVES)
Aurora from Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVS)

Solar panels
It will be the first mission to Jupiter using solar panels instead of the radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) used by Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, the Voyager program, and the Galileo orbiter. Advancement in solar cell technology and efficiency over the past several decades now makes it economically feasible to use solar panels of practical size to provide power so far from the Sun. In addition, RTGs are in short supply, limiting their availability for space missions. Also, by using solar energy, NASA avoids the protests associated with launching RTGs into space (due to accusations of public safety risks, which NASA refutes in detailed scientific reports); however, it should be noted that NASA plans several more projects involving RTGs,6 and the decision to use alternate technology on this mission is more practical and economical than political.
The Juno spacecraft uses three, 2 m x 9 m solar panels that will remain in sunlight continuously from launch through end of mission, except for a 10-minute period during the Earth gravity assist flyby.
