The North Wales child abuse scandal was the subject of a three-year, &lt;U+00A3&gt;13 million investigation into the physical and sexual abuse of children in care homes in Clwyd and Gwynedd, North Wales, including the Bryn Estyn children's home at Wrexham, between 1974 and 1990.1 The report into the scandal, headed by retired High Court judge Sir Ronald Waterhouse QC, which was published in 2000, resulted in changes in policy in England and Wales into how authorities deal with children in care, and to the settling of 140 compensation claims on behalf of victims of abuse.
In November 2012, new allegations led to the Prime Minister, David Cameron, announcing that a senior independent figure, later named as Mrs Justice Julia Macur, would examine the conduct and remit of the Waterhouse Inquiry. In addition, the Home Secretary, Theresa May, announced a new police inquiry into how the original allegations were dealt with, as well as investigating any new allegations.
Initial allegations and investigations
In 1989, a residential care worker in Gwynedd, Alison Taylor, made a series of allegations against senior social care professionals working for the authority. After being dismissed from her own post with the authority, she made further allegations about a care home, Bryn Estyn at Wrexham, which had been run until its closure in 1984 by Clwyd County Council. With the support of local politicians and the newly appointed Director of Social Services in Clwyd, several instances of previous allegations were uncovered, which had either not been properly investigated or where reports calling for action had been ignored.23
The matter was referred to North Wales Police who undertook an inquiry in 1993. As a result six residential social workers were prosecuted for abuse, three of whom had worked at Bryn Estyn. There were then allegations that members of the police force had themselves colluded in covering up allegations, and a further inquiry, undertaken by John Jillings, was commissioned by Clwyd County Council.4 The report of that inquiry, however, was not published because of concerns over libel, and legal advice and concerns from the council's insurers, Municipal Mutual Insurance, which warned that the report would encourage court cases and compensation claims.56 The former deputy head of Bryn Estyn, Peter Howarth, was jailed for 10 years in 1994 for sexually abusing teenage boys;7 he died in 1997.8
The Waterhouse Inquiry
In 1996, the then Secretary of State for Wales, William Hague, ordered a Tribunal of Inquiry into allegations of hundreds of cases of child abuse in care homes in former county council areas of Clwyd and Gwynedd between 1974 and 1990. Sir Ronald Waterhouse QC, a retired High Court judge, was appointed to head the inquiry.9
The inquiry began in January 1997. The tribunal sat for 203 days, and heard evidence from more than 650 people.10 More than 80 people, many of whom were care staff or teachers, were named as child abusers in statements to the inquiry. It was stated to be &quot;the biggest investigation ever held in Britain into allegations of physical, sexual and emotional abuse of children who passed through the care system&quot;.11 It ended in 1998 and its findings were published in February 2000, as Lost In Care.12 The report concluded that widespread sexual abuse of boys, as well as physical abuse and the unacceptable use of force, had occurred in children's homes in Clwyd,13 and named and criticised almost 200 people, for either abusing children or failing to offer them sufficient protection. It said:14

&quot;The evidence before us has disclosed that for many children who were consigned to Bryn Estyn, in the 10 or so years of its existence as a community home, it was a form of purgatory or worse from which they emerged more damaged than when they had entered and for whom the future had become even more bleak.&quot;

Although it identified 28 alleged perpetrators, none were named in the report.15 It found no evidence &quot;to establish that there was a wide-ranging conspiracy involving prominent persons and others with the objective of sexual activity with children in care&quot;,16 but did recognise the existence of a paedophile ring in the Wrexham and Chester area.171819
The Inquiry made 72 recommendations for changes, constituting a massive overhaul of the way in which children in care are dealt with by local councils, social services and the police.2021 After the report was published, 140 compensation claims were settled on behalf of victims, and a Children's Commissioner for Wales was appointed as a result of one of its recommendations.22
The Secret of Bryn Estyn: The Making of a Modern Witch Hunt
In 2005, the cultural historian Richard Webster published a book, The Secret of Bryn Estyn: The Making of a Modern Witch Hunt, which investigated the scandal. It was highly critical of the Waterhouse Inquiry, argued that abuse scandals could be phenomena created by public hysteria,23 and reported a number of cases of apparently innocent care workers imprisoned as a consequence of false and unsubstantiated accusations elicited by police trawling operations. Webster also questioned whether some of those claiming abuse had been motivated by the prospect of financial reward.24 Wrexham Council refused permission for a conference, arranged by Falsely Accused Carers and Teachers, a support group, to be held at Bryn Estyn - now renamed the Erlas Centre - in 2005; Webster was to have been the main speaker.25
Further allegations and investigations in 2012
On 2 November 2012, following the revelations in the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal, the BBC current affairs programme Newsnight aired an item about the scandal in which one of those who had suffered abuse in the 1980s, Steve Messham, made renewed claims that there had been a much wider circle of abusers, including businessmen, members of the police and senior politicians, extending beyond the immediate area to London and beyond.26 He called for a further investigation to be carried out.27 The Children's Commissioner for Wales, Keith Towler, supported the call for an inquiry, stating that the remit of the Waterhouse Inquiry had been too narrow.28
On 5 November 2012 the Prime Minister, David Cameron, said that any new allegations of abuse would be investigated, and announced that a &quot;senior independent figure&quot;, later named as Mrs Justice Julia Macur,29 would be appointed to look urgently into the terms of the original inquiry and whether it was properly constituted.30 Tom Watson MP called for a wider ranging inquiry, and referred to allegations of abuse by a former Cabinet minister.31 The Home Secretary, Theresa May, said that &quot;... we should look to make sure that the work that was done in relation to the Waterhouse inquiry did cover everything that it needed to cover.&quot; She announced on 6 November that Keith Bristow, the head of the National Crime Agency, would lead an investigation into how old claims of abuse were handled, and at fresh allegations. The investigation would involve the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) and the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), and would report by April 2013.32 The Shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, called for a single, overarching public inquiry to be held in order to examine all the recent allegations of child abuse, including those relating to the Jimmy Savile scandal,33 a call which was supported by former minister Tim Loughton and by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.34
On 6 November, Channel 4 News reported that Sir Peter Morrison, a former aide to Margaret Thatcher and MP for Chester, who died in 1995, had been 'seen' driving a boy away from the Bryn Estyn home.35 The Conservative Party said that they were investigating the claims.36 The following day, Ann Clwyd MP called for the 1994 Jillings report to be published.37 The Guardian reported that references made to a past Cabinet member's involvement may be the result of confusion over the identities of two members of a family sharing the same surname.38
