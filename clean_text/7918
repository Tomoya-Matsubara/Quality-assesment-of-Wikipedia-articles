In 1999, Deschanel made her film debut in Mumford, followed by her breakout role as Anita Miller in Cameron Crowe's 2000 semi-autobiographical film Almost Famous. Deschanel soon became known for her deadpan comedy and roles in films such as The Good Girl (2002), The New Guy (2002), Elf (2003), The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005), Failure to Launch (2006), Bridge to Terabithia (2007), Yes Man (2008), and (500) Days of Summer (2009).123 She has portrayed the role of Jessica Day on the Fox comedy series New Girl since 2011, for which she has received an Emmy Award nomination and three Golden Globe Award nominations.
For a few years starting in 2001, Deschanel performed in the jazz cabaret act If All the Stars Were Pretty Babies with fellow actress Samantha Shelton.4 Besides singing, she plays keyboards, percussion, banjo and ukulele.5 In 2006, Deschanel teamed up with M. Ward to release their debut album Volume One, under the name She &amp; Him which was released in March 2008. Their follow-up album Volume Two was released in the U.S. in March 2010, with their Christmas album A Very She &amp; Him Christmas being released in 2011, Volume 3 in 2013, and Classics in 2014. She also often sings in her films.
Early life
Deschanel was born in Los Angeles, California.6 She is the daughter of Academy Award&lt;U+2013&gt;nominated cinematographer and director Caleb Deschanel and actress Mary Jo Deschanel (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Weir). Her paternal grandfather was French, from Oullins, Rh&lt;U+00F4&gt;ne; her ancestry also includes Swiss, Dutch, Irish, and other French roots.78 She was raised as a Roman Catholic.9 She was named after Zooey Glass, the male protagonist of J. D. Salinger's 1961 novella Franny and Zooey.10 Her older sister, Emily Deschanel, is also an actress and stars in the TV series Bones.11 12
Deschanel lived in Los Angeles, but spent much of her childhood traveling because her father shot films on location; she later said that she &quot;hated all the traveling ... I'm really happy now that I had the experience, but at the time I was just so miserable to have to leave my friends in Los Angeles and go to places where they didn't have any food I liked or things I was used to.&quot;13 She attended Crossroads, a private preparatory school in Santa Monica, where she befriended future co-stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Kate Hudson.1415 She sang throughout high school, planning to pursue a career in musical theatre and attending French Woods Festival of the Performing Arts.16 She attended Northwestern University for nine months before dropping out to work as an actress.17
Career
Acting
Deschanel appeared in a guest role on the television series Veronica's Closet before making her film debut in Lawrence Kasdan's 1999 comedy Mumford, and later in the year she appeared (non-singing) in the music video for The Offspring's single &quot;She's Got Issues&quot;. In her second film, director Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical Almost Famous (2000), Deschanel played Anita Miller, the protagonist's rebellious older sister. The film received critical praise,18 but was not a box office success. She also appeared as Jimmy Fallon's girlfriend in the music video for his single, &quot;Idiot Boyfriend&quot;.
Deschanel played supporting roles in a series of films that include Manic (2001), with Don Cheadle and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Big Trouble (2002), with Tim Allen and Rene Russo, Abandon (2002) alongside Katie Holmes, Benjamin Bratt and Melanie Lynskey, and The Good Girl (2002) alongside Jennifer Aniston and Jake Gyllenhaal. In late 2002, The New York Times reported that Deschanel was &quot;one of Hollywood's most sought-after young stars,&quot;19 and the Los Angeles Times wrote in early 2003 that Deschanel had become a recognizable type, due to &quot;her deadpan, sardonic and scene-stealing [film] performances&quot; as the protagonist's best friend.20 Deschanel objected to her typecasting, arguing, &quot;A lot of these roles are just a formula idea of somebody's best friend, and it's like, I don't even have that many friends. In high school, I stayed home all the time, so I don't know how I'm everybody's best friend now.&quot;21
Deschanel appeared in Frasier, starring as Roz's out-of-control cousin, Jen, in the season 10 episode &quot;Kissing Cousin&quot; in 2002. That year, she also appeared in the film The New Guy as Nora, the guitar player in the lead character's band, Suburban Funk.
After turning down several supporting roles, Deschanel played her first lead role in All the Real Girls (2003). Her performance as Noel, a sexually curious 18-year-old virgin who has a life-changing romance with an aimless 22-year-old, received critical praise,22 and she was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress.23 Later in 2003, Deschanel played a deadpan department store worker opposite Will Ferrell in the comedy Elf, which became a box office hit.24
In 2004, Deschanel starred in Eulogy. In 2005, she played Trillian in the film adaptation of Douglas Adams' science fiction novel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and played the main character, Reese Holden in Winter Passing, with supporting role from Will Ferrell. Deschanel then played Sarah Jessica Parker's neurotic roommate in Failure to Launch (2006) and appeared on four episodes of the Showtime television series Weeds from 2006 to 2007, playing Andy Botwin's quirky ex-girlfriend, Kat. In September 2006, it was announced that Deschanel would play 1960s singer Janis Joplin in the film The Gospel According to Janis, to be co-written and directed by Penelope Spheeris.25 The film was scheduled to begin shooting in 2006, but was then postponed indefinitely;26 it was then resurrected again, with a planned release date of 2012, before being cancelled altogether in 2011. Deschanel expressed frustration with the cancellation, saying she had spent three years working on imitating Joplin's scratchy singing voice.27

Brennan's father, Max Keenan (guest star Ryan O'Neal), invites Margaret to spend Christmas with him and his daughter.36
In 2010, a pilot was made for a potential HBO series, I'm with the Band: Confessions of a Groupie, in which she played the title role of Pamela Des Barres,37 but the pilot was not picked up. In 2011, Deschanel played Belladonna in the fantasy-comedy film Your Highness alongside Danny McBride and James Franco.38

Film-related music
The New Guy (2002) was the first of Deschanel's films in which she sang onscreen. In Elf, she sings with Will Ferrell in the bathroom shower scene on &quot;Baby, It's Cold Outside&quot;, and was also heard singing it on the soundtrack with Leon Redbone. Her piano composition &quot;Bittersuite&quot; was used thematically in the dark, off-beat 2004 dramedy Winter Passing, in which she starred alongside Will Ferrell and Ed Harris. Subsequently, Deschanel also sings in Winter Passing (&quot;My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean&quot;).42
Others include: the television musical Once Upon a Mattress (&quot;An Opening for a Princess&quot;, &quot;In a Little While&quot;, &quot;Normandy&quot;, and &quot;Yesterday I Loved You&quot;);43 an old cabaret song in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (&quot;A Bird in a Gilded Cage&quot;); and the 2007 short film Raving (&quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;). Deschanel and the cast of school children sing the Steve Earle song &quot;Someday&quot; and War's &quot;Why Can't We Be Friends?&quot; in the 2007 film Bridge to Terabithia.44
In the film Yes Man, Deschanel sings several songs featured in the film and on the film soundtrack, and is shown singing &quot;Uh-Huh&quot; and &quot;Sweet Ballad&quot; alongside San Franciscan all-girl electro soul-punk group Von Iva in a fictional band called &quot;Munchausen by Proxy&quot;.45 In (500) Days of Summer Deschanel sings a cover of &quot;Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want&quot; by The Smiths&lt;U+2014&gt;it also appears on the soundtrack of the film, as performed by She &amp; Him.46 She also sings a cover of &quot;Sugar Town&quot; by Nancy Sinatra. Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a music video, called Bank Dance, directed by (500) Days of Summer director Marc Webb, to accompany the film. It uses the She &amp; Him song &quot;Why Do You Let Me Stay Here?&quot;, and some complicated choreography, choreographed by Michael Rooney. The film's producer, Mason Novick, said, &quot;We made the short because Zooey came in and said, 'I have this idea ... because I didn't get to dance in the movie'&quot; (as Gordon-Levitt did).47
Deschanel sings &quot;The Greatest Most Beautiful Love Song in All the Land&quot; with James Franco in the film Your Highness. She also appears in a number of songs (with M. Ward) on the soundtrack album for the 2011 release of Disney's Winnie the Pooh.48 Deschanel wrote and sings the theme song to New Girl.49 Also, in season three's episode &quot;Prince&quot;, the song &quot;Fallinlove2nite&quot; is sung by Deschanel and Prince. 50
