Kingswood School, referred to as 'Kingswood', is an independent day and boarding school located in Bath, Somerset, England. The school is coeducational and educates some 950 children aged 3 to 18. It is notable for being founded by John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, in 1748. It is the world's oldest Methodist educational institution1 and was established to provide an education for the sons of Methodist clergymen. It owns the Kingswood Preparatory School, the Upper and Middle Playing Fields and other buildings.
History
Kingswood School was founded by John Wesley in 1748 in Kingswood (then known as King's Wood) near Bristol and was established initially for the children of local colliers.2 They were joined by the sons of the itinerant ministers (clergy) of the Methodist Church.3 Woodhouse Grove School was founded in 1812 and was linked with Kingswood as a prep school for much of the nineteenth century. Created in 1995, Kingswood Prep School currently has 300 pupils.4 The total number of students educated on the Kingswood School campus between the ages of 3-18 is 960.56
The 1862 book How it was done at Stow School written by Theophilus Woolmer seems to have been based upon the author's own experiences at Kingswood (rather than Stowe School which was not yet established) under the notorious headmaster Crowther who enforced harsh discipline in the school in the 1820s.7
The school moved to its present location on the northern slopes of Bath in 1851.8 The old site was occupied for a while by an approved school. The present site is in the midst of  of the former Lansdown estate of the famous nineteenth-century millionaire eccentric, William Thomas Beckford.9 The Upper Playing Fields, comprising some 57 acres, are to the north of the senior school and include an athletics track and tennis and netball courts.10
Sons of lay people were first admitted to the school in 1922.
During World War II Kingswood was used by the government for military planning. For these years the school operated from Uppingham School.11 It is said that the Mulberry harbours of World War II were named after the Mulberry Bush that still exists outside the formerly named Moulton Hall of the school, but this has now been discounted. The Moulton Hall was named after old boy Lord Moulton but was remodelled as a library/learning resources area in 2006,12 and is now called the J O Heap library following a generous bequest by another Old Boy. During World War II the younger boys were moved to Prior's Court, an estate owned by Colonel Gerald Palmer, MP for Winchester. After the war the estate was purchased from Colonel Palmer and run as a Preparatory School until it was sold in 1997.13 A small number of boys (around six) started in the Junior house (Westwood) before the war, moved to Prior's Court on the outbreak of war, on to Uppingham and finally back to Kingswood at the war's end.
Some girls were admitted to the Bristol site in the early days before the school became boarding only.14 Girls were admitted to the school in its current form from 1972. 
Organisation
Like other public schools, Kingswood pupils are divided into Boarding Houses for both living convenience and sporting competitiveness. Each boys house is paired with a girls house (Upper with School, Hall with Fonthill and Middle with Summerhill), this is mainly for social events and unisex sports fixtures (e.g. sports day). Families tend to have strong 'house allegiances' going back generations.
Pupils are sorted into one of six houses in Year 9:15
Boys

Upper (day boys), house colour is yellow.
Middle (day and boarding boys), house colours are green and white.
Hall (day and boarding boys), house colour is maroon.

Girls

School (day girls and sixth form girl boarders)
Summerhill (day and boarding girls)
Fonthill (day and boarding girls)

Junior House

Westwood (day and boarding for boys &amp; girls in years 7 and 8), the largest house with approximately 170 day children and 30 boarders.

There is a hierarchy of student leadership within the school. The head boy and girl, the deputy head boy and girl and the heads of all six houses are incorporated into a body known as the 'PR' - a name which is believed to have originated from the 'Prefect Room' where they were once based. They are allowed to wear a black tie with the school's crest on the front. Under the PR there are 'Senior Prefects' which usually total around 20 members of the upper sixth.16 They are allowed to wear a silver tie with the school's crest on the front. Lastly there are the house prefects which make up most members of the upper sixth, they wear a silver tie with a wyvern symbol pattern on the front.
In keeping with tradition Chapel attendance is compulsory at least once a week.
Sport
Kingswood has a reputation for encouraging sports, with boys playing rugby, hockey and cricket. Kingswood competes with all other public schools in Somerset and most Kingswood boys consider King Edward's School, Bath and Prior Park College as their main rivals due to their close proximity and history of rivalry. Sporting achievements within the school are awarded by the presentation of &quot;Colours&quot;, first by a special tie and then a special blazer.
Kingswood Theatre
Used by the school during term time and available for hire during school holidays, Kingswood Theatre is on the site of the senior school. The theatre was officially opened in 1994 by Sir Edward Heath and completed a partial refurbishment in 2010. The theatre has 375 seats with a capacity of 450.17 The theatre has been used by BBC Question Time on a number of occasions.18 
Model United Nations
Kingswood hosts the largest school Model United Nations conference in the United Kingdom, known as the Bath International Schools Model United Nations (BISMUN). Delegates attend from schools worldwide.19
Eco-schools
The School is greatly involved with ecology, and has implemented a number of projects to promote the importance of the environment and reduce waste at the school. Kingswood was one of the first schools in the area to adopt the Eco-schools project and be awarded its Green Flag. It has since begun outreach work with other local schools, including Batheaston Junior School. The school was awarded its third Green Flag in 2010.20
Kingswood-Oxford School
George Nicholson, an alumnus of Kingswood School, Bath, established a school for boys of the same name in West Hartford, Connecticut in 1916. This new institution inherited some of the traditions of its counterpart in Bath, including the School's crest, motto, colors and distinctive symbol, the Wyvern. In 1969 the school merged with the Oxford School for girls into the new Kingswood-Oxford School.21
Kingswood College, Grahamstown
Kingswood College in Grahamstown, South Africa, was founded in 189422 and derives its name and ideals from Kingswood school in Bath. They also use the same distinctive Wyvern crest and abide by the same Methodist ethos.
