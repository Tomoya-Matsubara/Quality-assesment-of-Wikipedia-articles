Adam Best is an upcoming fictional character in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. He will be played by David Proud, the first adult actor with a visible disability to appear in the soap.1
Creation
Adam is the son of character Manda Best, played by Josie Lawrence. Both the character and the actor suffer from spina bifida, and are wheelchair users.23 He is being introduced as part of a series of measures by the BBC to raise the profile of disabled actors.4 The character is described as &quot;a 20-year-old self-obsessed, snobbish Oxford University student who arrives in Walford during the holidays to stay with his mother.&quot;5
Speaking of his casting, Proud said he is &quot;delighted and honoured to be joining such a talented cast [and] very excited and looking forward to bringing the character to life.&quot;6 The show's executive producer, Diederick Santer, said it was &quot;about time&quot; the show cast an adult actor with a disability: &quot;In recent years, we've had a number of regular and guest characters with disabilities, some of them children like Janet Mitchell and more recently Syd's son, Noah. We've also told the story of Jean Slater who suffers from bipolar disorder. But this is the first time we've had a regular adult character with a visible disability played by an actor with a disability. It's about time.&quot;7 Santer added that the character would be &quot;interesting, but possibly irritating&quot;.8
It is said that the character will form a low opinion of his mother's partner Minty Peterson (played by Cliff Parisi) and will fall for Libby Fox (Belinda Owusu), the girlfriend of Darren Miller (Charlie G. Hawkins).910
