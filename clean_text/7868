Stephens City () is an incorporated town in the southern part of Frederick County, Virginia, United States, with a population of 1,146 at the time of the 2000 Census and an estimated population of 1,503 in 2009.
Founded by Peter Stephens in the 1730s, the colonial town was chartered and named for Lewis Stephens in September 1758. It was originally settled by German Protestants from Heidelberg. Stephens City is the second-oldest municipality in the Shenandoah Valley after nearby Winchester, which is about  to the north. &quot;Crossroads&quot;, the first free black community in the Valley in the pre-Civil War years, was founded east of town in the 1850s. Crossroads remained until the beginning of the Civil War when the freed blacks either escaped or were recaptured. Stephens City was saved from being burnt in 1864 by Union Major Joseph K. Stearns. The town has gone through several name changes in its history, starting as Stephensburg, then Newtown, and finally winding up as Stephens City, though it nearly became Pantops. Interstate 81 and U.S. Route 11 pass close to and through the town, respectively.
A large section of the center of the town, including buildings and homes, covering , is part of the Newtown-Stephensburg Historic District and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Stephens City celebrated its 250th anniversary on September 1, 2008. The town is a part of the Winchester, Virginia-West Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area, an offshoot of the Washington&lt;U+2013&gt;Baltimore&lt;U+2013&gt;Northern Virginia, DC&lt;U+2013&gt;MD&lt;U+2013&gt;VA&lt;U+2013&gt;WV Combined Statistical Area. It is a member of the Winchester&lt;U+2013&gt;Frederick County Metropolitan Planning Organization.1
History
Founding and early days
Jost Hite, a German immigrant, purchased a large land grant in the northern Shenandoah Valley in 1731.23 Peter Stephens and a small party of German Protestants from Heidelberg, in the Palatinate, arrived about 1732 to buy and settle that land, including the site of what became Stephens City, named for the Stephens family.456 Although Hite's title to the land was challenged by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, the land baron of the area,7 the matter was settled amicably.89
Town lots were laid out beginning in 1754, and in 1758 the Virginia General Assembly granted a charter for the town of &quot;Stephensburgh&quot;. The mostly German-speaking residents soon left off the &quot;h&quot;; the town was usually spelled &quot;Stephensburg&quot;.10 By the start of the Revolutionary War, Stephensburg was often called simply &quot;New Town&quot; or &quot;Newtown&quot;, as the new settlement on the Great Wagon Road south of Winchester.11
Shenandoah Valley and Newtown's central location attracted heavy traffic through the region, and wagon-making emerged as an important industry for the town; Newtown artisans supplied wagons throughout the state.12

By 1830, the town's population had reached 800.13 In the late 1850s, free blacks began a settlement about a mile east of town which became known as Crossroads or Freetown. The community lasted until the Civil War began, when some of the free blacks left for the North; others were captured and forced to fight for the Confederates.14
When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, the majority of Newtown's young men joined Confederate forces.1516 During the war, the town was &quot;between the lines&quot;,17 nominally controlled by the Union but with much Confederate partisan activity.18 On May 24, 1864, Stonewall Jackson's Confederate forces advanced northward on the Valley Pike and attacked Union troops. At Newtown, General George Henry Gordon of the Second Massachusetts Infantry ordered his Federal troops to make a stand. The skirmishing involved heavy artillery fire, but Gordon's men retreated without loss of the important supply wagons. When Gordon left the town to Jackson's forces, both sides claimed a victory.1920

 In June 1864, Major Joseph K. Stearns of the 1st New York Cavalry arrived under orders to burn the town down to help stop Confederate ambushes on the wagon road. Because the remaining population mostly consisted of women, children and the elderly, Stearns allowed the town to stand. He required the adult residents to take the &quot;Ironclad oath&quot;,2122 in which they swore that they had not voluntarily provided aid to the Confederacy. The government required the oath, effectively excluding ex-Confederates from the political arena during Reconstruction.23
In April 1867, the Virginia General Assembly granted a charter to the Winchester and Strasburg Railroad Company. The company was authorized to construct a rail line between Winchester and Strasburg, linking Newtown to the rest of the nation by railroad for the first time. Though the railroad improved the local economy, which had lagged after the end of the war, it decimated the wagon-building trade.24 In 1880, the United States Post Office Department, faced with nearly a dozen Newtowns in Virginia, announced that the local post office would be renamed Pantops. Dissatisfied with the name, the townsfolk chose &quot;Stephens City&quot;.2526
20th century to present
The 20th century brought improvements to energy and domestic systems: electrical service was introduced in 1915; and in 1941, just before World War II, the town installed a water system.27 The construction of Interstate 81 (I-81) during the early 1960s depressed business development in the town. The wagon road, which had been made part of U.S. Route 11, had led traffic through the center of town, but the interstate passed less than a tenth of a mile to the east, encouraging development east of town and causing the downtown businesses to decline. Developers constructed new residential subdivisions both within and outside the town boundaries to the east for access to I-81.28
The town surveyed its older buildings to establish architectural significance and to determine those that contributed to the town's historic center. The Newtown-Stephensburg Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in August 1992.29 Renovation of the town center has attracted heritage tourism. Anticipating more growth, the town annexed  of unincorporated Frederick County in 2005, another  in 2006, and  in 2007.30 The town celebrated its 250th anniversary on September 1, 2008.31
On September 17, 2004, remnants of Hurricane Ivan spawned an F1 tornado that touched down just south of the town along Interstate 81. It caused approximately $1 million in damage and injured two people.323334 It was one of a record 40 tornadoes to hit northern Virginia that day.35
Geography
The town is located between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains in the northern Shenandoah Valley of Virginia in close proximity to West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. Washington, D.C. is approximately  to the west36 and Baltimore is  to the northwest.37
Climate
Stephens City is located in the humid subtropical climate zone (K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppen climate classification: Cfa), exhibiting four distinct seasons.38 Its climate is typical of Mid-Atlantic U.S. areas removed from bodies of water. The town is located in plant hardiness zone 7 throughout the town and surrounding Frederick County, indicating a temperate climate.39 Spring and fall are warm, with low humidity, while winter is cool, with annual snowfall averaging .40 Average winter lows tend to be around 30 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (&lt;U+2212&gt;1 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C) from mid-December to mid-February. Blizzards affect Stephens City on average once every four to six years. The most violent nor'easters typically feature high winds, heavy rains, and occasional snow. These storms often affect large sections of the U.S. East Coast.41
Summers are hot and humid; during this season, highs average in the upper 80s &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (lower 30s &lt;U+00B0&gt;C) and lows average in the upper 60s &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (lower 20s &lt;U+00B0&gt;C).42 The combination of heat and humidity in the summer brings very frequent thunderstorms, some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area. While hurricanes (or their remnants) occasionally track through the area in late summer and early fall, they have often weakened by the time they reach Stephens City, partly due to the city's far inland location. The highest recorded temperature was  in 1918, 1988, and again in 2010, while the lowest recorded temperature was  in 1983.43

Education
Frederick County Public Schools operate the public schools that serve Stephens City, although none is located within Stephens City proper; public schools that serve Stephens City are within a mile of the town limits. The town and surrounding area are served by Bass-Hoover Elementary School,91 Robert E. Aylor Middle School,92 and Sherando High School.93 The latter was named for one of the historic Iroquoian-speaking tribes encountered by early European settlers to the Shenandoah Valley. Local private schools are available, and are also outside the town's corporate limits. Shenandoah Valley Christian Academy is located at the northern section of the town limits.94 Powhatan School is in nearby Boyce in Clarke County, Virginia.95 Other smaller private or Christian-based schools are located throughout Frederick County and elsewhere in the area.
Transportation
Historic U.S. Route 11 traverses Stephens City proper, while Interstate 81 serves as the eastern border of the town.96 Stephens City serves as the western terminus of State Route 277, which begins at U.S. Route 11 and ends only  away in Double Tollgate, Clarke County, Virginia at U.S. Routes 340 and 522.97
Plans are in place to move State Route 277 to near The Family Drive-In Theatre,  south of its current western terminus with US Route 11. The eastern terminus will be near Lake Frederick at US Route 522 in Clarke County near the Warren County line.98 The planned construction will also move the I-81 interchange at Stephens City, where there are a number of service stations and fast food restaurants, south of the town limits to alleviate congestion on the current Route 277 bridge, which will remain after construction is completed. Planners expect expansion of Stephens City to the south.99
