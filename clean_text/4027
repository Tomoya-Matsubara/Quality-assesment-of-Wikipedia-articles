Sergei Natanovich Bernstein (, sometimes Romanized as ; March 5, 1880 &lt;U+2013&gt; October 26, 1968) was a Russian and Soviet mathematician of Jewish origin known for contributions to partial differential equations, differential geometry, probability theory, and approximation theory.12
Work
Partial differential equations
In his doctoral dissertation, submitted in 1904 to the Sorbonne, Bernstein solved Hilbert's nineteenth problem on the analytic solution of elliptic differential equations.3 His later work was devoted to Dirichlet's boundary problem for non-linear equations of elliptic type, where, in particular, he introduced a priori estimates.
Probability theory
In 1917, Bernstein suggested the first axiomatic foundation of probability theory, based on the underlying algebraic structure.4 It was later superseded by the measure-theoretic approach of Kolmogorov.
In the 1920's, he introduced a method for proving limit theorems for sums of dependent random variables.
Approximation theory
Bernstein laid the foundations of constructive function theory, a field studying the connection between smoothness properties of a function and its approximations by polynomials.5 In particular, he proved Bernstein's theorem (approximation theory).
