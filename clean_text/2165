History
Early years (1985&lt;U+2013&gt;2000)

Tijs Verwest began DJing professionally at school parties and then moved on to become a resident DJ between 1985 and 1994 at several clubs in the Netherlands after his manager and friend Wilfred encouraged him.89 During these years, he produced hardcore/gabber tracks under aliases such as Da Joker and DJ Limited.10 However, it was at The Spock, a small club in Breda, where he was able to fine-tune his own style by playing in a separate room from 10 pm until 4 am on weekends.11 He was discovered by the GM of Rotterdam-based Basic Beat Recordings, Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto released his first of five mix CDs as a part of the label's Forbidden Paradise series. 12 In the mid-1990s, he started to produce trance,13 and in 1997 he and Arny Bink co-founded Black Hole Recordings to support his work releasing a series of singles under various aliases.14 Black Hole Recordings and its sub-label Magik Muzik continue to sign Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto's vision of trance â€“ producing musicians and DJs such as Cor Fijneman, Ton TB, and Mark Norman and also Joe Cheang.15 During this period, DJ Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto had been releasing the Magik series, which has had seven installments starting in 1997 and ending in 2001, after this Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto began releasing the In Search of Sunrise series, that is a compilation of Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto's mixes with tracks from other DJ's. In 1999, Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto joined forces with fellow Dutch deejay Ferry Corsten to create the trance based duo of Gouryella.16 To highlight the importance in the expansion of the trance environment at the time, there were 20 different CD releases of the 4 Gouryella tracks from 9 different labels.
Rise to fame (2000&lt;U+2013&gt;2004)
 Late in 2000, Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto decided to concentrate on his personal work and left Corsten by himself to write and produce Gouryella's next single with John Ewbank, the record company was demanding more tracks and neither Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto or Ferry could work together at the time.sto Interview&quot;/&gt;17 Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto introduced Armin van Buuren, Johan Gielen and Ferry Corsten to the mainstream with his first compilations and the In Trance We Trust (series). Summerbreeze became Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto's debute dj mix album in the United States with the help of a contract signed to Nettwerk.18 Summerbreeze featured his remix of Delerium's Silence, it spent four weeks in the United Kingdom's Top Ten chart, it reached number three in the Billboard dance chart and is still an epic track.19 In early 2001, Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto broke a world record by drinking &quot;31 cans of Red Bull in 24 hours&quot;, he admitted he would never try and break it again.20
Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto's fame started to rise in the late 1990s after his set at the first ID&amp;T Innercity party (Live at Innercity: Amsterdam RAI),21 and the release of In My Memory, his first solo album released in 2001 which contained 10 singles. His fame continued to skyrocket in the early 2000s following his six-hour &quot;Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto Solo&quot; sets which he performed without other DJs or opening acts. This idea, of one DJ playing alone to a large crowd, was brought to its pinnacle when Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto was the first DJ to hold a solo concert in a stadium; on May 10 2003, he performed for over 25,000 people in Arnhem's Gelredome.22 This concert was later called &quot;Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto in Concert&quot;, the event was an enormous success. He repeated the same type of concert the following year during two consecutive nights in late October.23 In addition to holding these two concerts for 35,000 of his fans, he held another concert for a crowd of 20,000 in Hasselt, Belgium the following week.sto In Concert&quot;/&gt; DVDs of both his May 10 2003 and October 30 2004 concerts have been released, having the other DVD titled &quot;Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto In Concert 2&quot;. The DVD's show the journey from the first idea to the main event, it features live performances by Andain, Dinand Woesthoff, and Jan Johnston. The event includes live music and dancers performing at different times throughout the set. The theme of the event is a mystical, musical journey around the world based on the theme of Magik. 24 It consists of 200+ minutes of performances with a second disc with special features, It includes a behind-the-scenes looking at The Making Of the event, the music video for his song &quot;Traffic&quot; and TV Commercials for the event. During this period he was crowned as &quot;No. 1. DJ in the World&quot; by DJ Magazine (UK) in 2002, 2003, and 2004.25
Olympics Opening Ceremony (2004)
 In 2004 he released his second artist album Just Be, which featured his first single Traffic which is the first non-vocal track to reach number one spot in the Dutch national charts for 23 years.26 Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto and Kirsty Hawkshaw's production and single &quot;Just Be&quot; appeared in the Nip / Tuck: Original TV Soundtrack.27 Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto's remix of the Kane song &quot;Rain Down on Me&quot; is featured in the game FIFA Football 2004.28 The Athens Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (ATHOC) asked Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto to perform at the Olympic Games, making him the first DJ to play live on stage at an Olympic Games at the 2004 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony in Athens for 90 minutes.29

&quot;The opportunity to perform my music for billions of people around the globe will be the greatest highlight of my life, I am honoured to be part of the biggest sports event in the world.&quot;
- said Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto about the ATHOC.30

During the parade, all participating nations introduced their athletes which were over 10,500 in total.31 During the course of his performance the Dutch athletes started dancing in front of the DJ booth and had to be moved on by officials. The performance included new tracks produced especially for the Opening Ceremony and songs that were created to compliment the spirit and theme of the Ceremony. A condensed studio-recorded album of the songs played on the Olympic set was later released, including new songs especially composed for the occasion, entitled Parade of the Athletes in October 2004.32 In the liner notes, he noted the IOC requested to him that the music not contain any lyrics as they could be inadvertently misinterpreted.
Concerts and side work (2005-2006)
In January 6 Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto performed in an outdoor fundraiser in De Dam, Amsterdam, the event was free and many famous Dutch artists were involved in it to provide financial aid to the people who suffered from the tsunami in Asia.

Even this was surpassed later in the same summer where some 250,000 people danced on Ipanema Beach, Brazil, the second largest concert in the history of mankind.37  During 2005 he also made a small cameo appearance in the award-winning film It's All Gone Pete Tong as himself.38 He also contributed the song Goldrush to the PlayStation Portable futuristic racing game Wipeout Pure.39 BPM (magazine) has an annual poll in the United States which is unveiled in the WMC, in 2005 Ti&lt;U+00EB&gt;sto took the No. 1 spot.40 On March 19 2006, the Formula 1 circus took place in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
