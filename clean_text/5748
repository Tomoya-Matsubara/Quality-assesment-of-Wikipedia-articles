The Porsche Panamera (type number 970) is a luxury four-door saloon.123 It is front-engined with rear-wheel drive, with four-wheel drive versions also available.
The Porsche Panamera production model was unveiled at the 13th Auto Shanghai International Automobile Show in Shanghai, China, on April 2009.4 In 2011, hybrid and diesel versions were launched. In April 2013, a facelift to the Panamera was announced, launching again at the Auto Shanghai show.5 A plug-in hybrid version, the Panamera S E-Hybrid, is scheduled to be released in Germany in July 2013.67
Concept and description
  The Panamera's name is derived, like the Porsche Carrera line, from the Carrera Panamericana race. The Panamera is generally considered to be the long-awaited fruit of Porsche's 989 concept from the late 1980s.
The Panamera is marketed as a more exciting and higher performing alternative to the traditional executive saloons such as the BMW 7 Series, the Audi A8, and the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The Panamera competes more directly with cars such as the Maserati Quattroporte, Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class, BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo89 and Aston Martin Rapide.10
Like the Porsche Cayenne SUV (which has become the marque's best-selling vehicle), the Panamera upset many Porsche purists, since it was seen as an attempt to broaden Porsche's appeal beyond that of hardcore fans. The Panamera ran contrary to the company's signature offerings, particularly its light two-door rear-engine sports cars like the 911. The Panamera on the other hand is considered a full-size luxury car, weighing nearly , with four doors, and its engine mounted in the front. The Panamera's appearance with its long hood and rear hatch bears little resemblance to a stretched 911, although it does resemble the 911 from certain angles.11 The iconic 911 has a sparse interior, as it was focused on raw performance, while the Panamera has a sumptuous interior loaded with modern technological amenities and expensive leather upholstery.1213
Production
Engines are first assembled in Stuttgart, and the car's body is built and painted at the Volkswagen Group facility in Hannover. The final assembly of the vehicle takes place in Leipzig, Germany, alongside the Cayenne.14
Production began in April 2009, one month after its debut in the Shanghai Motor Show in China.15
Porsche has applied for patents on a four-door convertible version of the Panamera that keep the same general dimensions.16
First generation
The V8-powered Panamera S, 4S, and Turbo models were the first versions that debuted in 2009. In addition to the 4.8L Twin Turbo  V8, Porsche launched two further models in 2010: the Panamera and Panamera 4 which are both powered by 3.6-litre V6 engines producing .
Being derived from the V8 engine of the Panamera S and Panamera 4S, the V6 retains the V8's technologies like Direct Fuel Injection, infinitely variable intake camshaft adjustment with variable valve lift (VarioCam Plus), an on-demand oil pump, water cooling with thermal management, a variable intake manifold, as well as integrated dry sump lubrication with two-stage extraction of oil, and an Auto Start-Stop function (only with the PDK transmission).17 Turbo version uses active aerodynamics with a multi-stage, adjustable rear spoiler.18 Optional Sports Chrono Packages include a Sport Plus button, which has tighter damping and air springs, and lowers the car body by .19
In 2011, the Panamera S Hybrid,20 Diesel,21 Turbo S22 and GTS variants were added to the range.
The Panamera, S, Hybrid and Diesel models are rear-wheel drive, while the Panamera 4, 4S and GTS have the same four-wheel drive system as the Turbo and Turbo S, called Porsche Traction Management (PTM).

Panamera S Hybrid
 In 2008, Porsche AG announced the development of a parallel hybrid system for the Panamera.30 and in February 2011, Porsche unveiled the Panamera S Hybrid.

The Panamera S Hybrid produces only 159 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer, rendering it the cleanest car in the entire Porsche model range, but still provides a top speed of .
Deliveries began in the United States in 2011, and cumulative sales reached 684 units through March 2013.3233 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the fuel economy for the 2013/2012 model year Panamera Hybrid at  for city driving,  for highway, and  combined.34
Panamera Diesel

The Panamera's engine has a power output of . The car is capable of accelerating from 0&lt;U+2013&gt;100 km/h in 6.8 seconds and has a top speed of . It is also the most economical Porsche in the entire vehicle range, consuming just 6.3 liters per 100 kilometers (37 mpg).

Panamera S E-Hybrid
As part of the 2013 Panamaera facelift, Porsche announced the introduction of a plug-in hybrid model, the Panamera S E-Hybrid. Sales are scheduled to begin in Germany in July 2013. The plug-in model will be unveiled at the April 2013 Shanghai Auto Show.3637
The S E-Hybrid is powered by a  electric motor, with a total system power of . Top speed is  in all-electric mode, and its time from  is 5.2 seconds. The plug-in electric hybrid will have a 9.4 kWh lithium-ion battery pack capable of delivering a range of more than  under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) standard. The battery can be fully charged in approximately 2&lt;U+00BD&gt; hours from a 240V power source. The Panamera plug-in hybrid reduces fuel consumption to , down from  for the current Panamera hybrid, which translates to  emissions of 71 g/km, down from 167g/km for the current hybrid.3839
Reception
Despite the differences in dimensions and design, a reviewer noted that the Panamera's driving dynamics were close to that of the 911, and it &quot;seems to occupy the no-man's-land between really good sports sedans and proper sports cars&quot;, and so far the Panamera has won every comparison test against other four-door performance cars on the market such as the Maserati Quattroporte and Aston Martin Rapide.4041 Function was also praised, with the  hatchback trunk, and the four-corner adaptive air suspension that retained superior handling while also providing a comfortable ride for public roads. Edmunds stated that the Panamera was an innovative engineering feat that &quot;makes a unique statement about the way that luxury transportation and serious high-performance potential can be mixed together in one car&quot;.4243
Unlike most of the V8-engined contemporaries, all models of the Panamera avoid the US Gas Guzzler Tax. The V6-powered Panamera was also praised, as its smaller engine still retained respectable acceleration,44 and as it had even better handling than its V8 siblings, due to the engine being lighter by  which gave the car better weight distribution.45
However, CAR magazine of the U.K. described the S model as lacking sportiness, which they attributed to their test car's being &quot;about as oriented to comfort as it&lt;U+2019&gt;s possible to get&quot;46 and called the Turbo model &quot;a missed opportunity on behalf of Porsche&quot; to be &quot;the world&lt;U+2019&gt;s first lightweight four seater&quot; as the top model weighs as much as an Audi S8.47
The 30 November 2008 edition of BBC's Top Gear featured a look at the Panamera in its news section, with the three presenters being very critical of the look. In the June 2009 edition, Richard Hammond and James May were seen driving the Panamera along the A30 in Devon, Great Britain They were racing against a letter sent via Royal Mail between the Isles of Scilly and the Orkney Islands. Jeremy Clarkson reviewed the Porsche Panamera for an article with The Times newspaper and was quite critical.48
Sales
As of 2011, the largest national market was the United States with 6188 sold.49 Sales by cities: Los Angeles (890), New York (760), Hong Kong (300), Dubai (285), Tokyo (223), Munich (206), Moscow (203), Shanghai (188), Hamburg (117) and Berlin (108).50 Sales internationally by model variant: Panamera 4S (9394), Turbo (6171), S (4563) and V6 (2390&lt;U+2014&gt;introduced weeks earlier).51
