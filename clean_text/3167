&quot;The Movie&quot; is the fifty-fourth episode of the sitcom Seinfeld. It is the 14th episode of the fourth season, and first aired on January 6, 1993.
Plot
Jerry schedules two stand-up acts in the same night and afterwards goes to the movie theater to meet everyone. George gets in the wrong line for tickets, and soon goes with Elaine and Kramer to another theater to see the movie Checkmate. Kramer waits outside for Jerry but also wants a Papaya King hot dog. Jerry misses his first show and discovers his spot was taken by an annoying comedian, who then accompanies Jerry back to the theater to tell George, Elaine, and Kramer that he won't be able to see the movie with them, but discovers they aren't there. Meanwhile, Elaine struggles to save seats for everyone, and George runs afoul with an usher. Jerry then misses his second show after being delayed by his taxi driver.
Through a comedy of errors, everyone (but Kramer) misses the movie they were originally going to see and end up in &quot;Rochelle, Rochelle&quot;.
