Charles Wade Barkley (born February 20, 1963) is a retired American professional basketball player. Nicknamed &quot;Sir Charles&quot; for his aggressive and outspoken demeanor, and &quot;The Round Mound of Rebound&quot; for his unusual build and talent, Barkley established himself as one of the National Basketball Association's (NBA's) most dominating power forwards. He was selected to the All-NBA First Team five times, the All-NBA Second Team five times, and once to the All-NBA Third Team. He earned eleven NBA All-Star Game appearances and was named the All-Star MVP in 1991. In 1993, he was voted the league's Most Valuable Player and during the NBA's 50th anniversary, named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. He competed in the 1992 and 1996 Olympic games and won two gold medals as a member of the United States' Dream Team. In 2006, Barkley was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.1
Barkley was popular with the fans and media and made the NBA's All-Interview Team for his last 13 seasons in the league.2 He was frequently involved in on- and off-court fights and sometimes stirred national controversy, as in March 1991 when he mistakenly spat on a young girl, and as in 1993 when he declared that sports figures should not be considered role models. Short for a power forward, Barkley used his strength and aggressiveness to become one of the NBA's most dominant rebounders. He was a versatile player who had the ability to score, create plays, and defend. In 2000, he retired as one of only four players in NBA history with 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists3, although a fifth player, Kevin Garnett, has since accomplished that feat.
Since retiring as a player, Barkley has had a successful career as a color commentator on basketball. He works with Turner Network Television (TNT) as a studio pundit for its coverage of NBA games.4 In addition, Barkley has written several books and has shown an interest in politics; in October 2008, he announced that he will be running for Governor of Alabama in 2014.5
Early life
Barkley was born and raised in suburban Leeds, Alabama, ten miles (16 km) outside of Birmingham, and attended Leeds High School. As a junior, Barkley stood 5'10&quot; (1.78 m) and weighed 220 pounds (99.8 kg). He failed to make the varsity team and was named as a reserve. However, during the summer Barkley grew to 6'4&quot; and earned a starting position on the varsity team in his senior year. He averaged 19.1 points and 17.9 rebounds per game and led his team to a 26&lt;U+2013&gt;3 record en route to the state semifinals.6 Despite his improvement, Barkley garnered no attention from college scouts until the state high school semifinals, where he scored 26 points against Alabama's most highly recruited player, Bobby Lee Hurt.7 An assistant to Auburn University's head coach, Sonny Smith, was at the game and reported seeing, &quot;a fat guy... who can play like the wind&quot;.8 Barkley was soon recruited by Smith and majored in business management while attending Auburn University.9
College
Barkley played collegiate basketball at Auburn University for three years. Although he struggled to control his weight, he excelled as a player and led the SEC in rebounding each year.10 He became a popular crowd-pleaser, exciting the fans with dunks and blocked shots that belied his lack of height and overweight frame. It was not uncommon to see the hefty Barkley grab a defensive rebound and, instead of passing, dribble the entire length of the court and finish at the opposite end with a two-handed dunk. His physical size and skills ultimately earned him the nickname &quot;The Round Mound of Rebound.&quot;11
During his college career, Barkley played the center position, despite being shorter than the average center. His height, officially listed as , is stated as  in his book, I May Be Wrong but I Doubt It. He became a member of Auburn's All-Century team and still holds the Auburn record for career field goal percentage with 62.6%.12 He received numerous awards, including Southeastern Conference (SEC) Player of the Year (1984), three All-SEC selections and one Second Team All-American selection.13 Later, Barkley was named the SEC Player of the Decade for the 1980s by the Birmingham Post-Herald.14
In Barkley's three-year college career, he averaged 14.8 points on 68.2% field goal shooting, 9.6 rebounds, 1.6 assists and 1.7 blocks per game.15 In 1984, he made his only appearance in the NCAA Tournament and finished with 23 points on 80% field goal shooting, 17 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 steals and 2 blocks.16 Auburn retired Barkley's No. 34 jersey on March 3, 2001.17
NBA career
Philadelphia 76ers
Barkley left before his final year at Auburn and made himself eligible for the 1984 NBA Draft. He was selected with the fifth pick in the first round by the Philadelphia 76ers, two slots after the Chicago Bulls drafted Michael Jordan. He joined a veteran team that included Julius Erving, Moses Malone and Maurice Cheeks, players who took Philadelphia to the 1983 NBA championship. Under the tutelage of Malone, Barkley was able to manage his weight and learned to prepare and condition himself properly for a game. He averaged 14.0 points and 8.6 rebounds per game during the regular season and earned a berth on the All-Rookie Team.18 In the postseason, the Sixers advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals but were defeated in five games by the Boston Celtics.19 As a rookie in the postseason, Barkley averaged 14.9 points and 11.1 rebounds per game.20
During his second year, Barkley became the team's leading rebounder and number two scorer, averaging 20.0 points and 12.8 rebounds per game.21 He became the Sixers' starting power forward and helped lead his team into the playoffs, averaging 25.0 points on .578 shooting from the field and 15.8 rebounds per game.22 Despite his efforts, Philadelphia was defeated 4&lt;U+2013&gt;3 by the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. He was named to the All-NBA Second Team.23
In the 1986&lt;U+2013&gt;87 season, Moses Malone was traded to the Washington Bullets and Barkley began to assume control as the team leader. He earned his first rebounding title, averaging 14.6 rebounds per game and also led the league in offensive rebounds with 5.7 per game.24 He averaged 23.0 points on .594 shooting,25 earning his first trip to an NBA All-Star game and All-NBA Second Team honors for the second straight season. In the playoffs, Barkley averaged 24.6 points and 12.6 rebounds in a losing effort,26 for the second straight year, to the Bucks in a five-game first round playoff series.27
The following season, Julius Erving announced his retirement and Barkley became the Sixers' franchise player.28 Playing in 80 games and getting 300 more minutes than his nearest teammate, Barkley had his most productive season, averaging 28.3 points on .587 shooting and 11.9 rebounds per game.29 He appeared in his second All-Star Game and was named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career. His celebrity status as the Sixers' franchise player led to his first appearance on the cover of Sports Illustrated.30 For the first time since the 1974&lt;U+2013&gt;75 season, however, the 76ers failed to make the playoffs.31 In the 1988&lt;U+2013&gt;89 season, Barkley continued to play well, averaging 25.8 points on .579 shooting and 12.5 rebounds per game.32 He earned his third straight All-Star Game appearance and was named to the All-NBA First team for the second straight season.33 Despite Barkley contributing 27.0 points on .644 shooting, 11.7 rebounds and 5.3 assists per game,34 the 76ers were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the New York Knicks.35
During the 1989&lt;U+2013&gt;90 season, despite receiving more first-place votes,36 Barkley finished second in MVP voting behind the Los Angeles Lakers' Magic Johnson.37 He was named Player of the Year by The Sporting News and Basketball Weekly.38 He averaged 25.2 points and 11.5 rebounds per game and a career high .600 shooting.39 He was named to the All-NBA First Team for the third consecutive year and earned his fourth All-Star selection.40 He helped Philadelphia win 53 regular season games, only to lose to the Chicago Bulls in a five-game Eastern Conference Semifinals series.41 Barkley averaged 24.7 points and 15.5 rebounds in another postseason loss.42 His exceptional play continued into his seventh season, where he averaged 27.6 points on .570 shooting and 10.1 rebounds per game.43 His fifth straight All-Star Game appearance proved to be his best yet. He led the East to a 116&lt;U+2013&gt;114 win over the West with 17 points and 22 rebounds, the most rebounds in an All-Star Game since Wilt Chamberlain recorded 22 in 1967.44 Barkley was presented with Most Valuable Player honors at the All-Star Game and, at the end of the season, named to the All-NBA First Team for the fourth straight year.45 In the postseason, Philadelphia lost again to Jordan's Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, with Barkley contributing 24.9 points and 10.5 rebounds per game.46
The 1991&lt;U+2013&gt;92 season was Barkley's final year in Philadelphia. In his last season, he wore number 32 instead of his 34 to honor Magic Johnson,47 who had announced prior to the start of the season that he was HIV-positive. Although the 76ers initially retired the number 32 in honor of Billy Cunningham, it was unretired for Barkley to wear. Following Johnson's announcement, Barkley also apologized for having made light of his condition. Responding to concerns that players may contract HIV by contact with Johnson, Barkley stated, &quot;We're just playing basketball. It's not like we're going out to have unprotected sex with Magic.&quot;48
In his final season with the Sixers, averaging 23.1 points on .552 shooting and 11.1 rebounds per game,49 Barkley earned his sixth straight All-Star appearance and was named to the All-NBA Second Team, his seventh straight appearance on either the first or second team. He ended his 76ers career ranked fourth in team history in total points (14,184), third in scoring average (23.3 ppg), third in rebounds (7,079), eighth in assists (2,276) and second in field-goal percentage (.576).50 He led Philadelphia in rebounding and field-goal percentage for seven consecutive seasons and in scoring for six straight years.51 However, Barkley demanded a trade out of Philadelphia after the Sixers failed to make the postseason with a 35&lt;U+2013&gt;47 record.5253 On July 17, 1992, he was traded to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Jeff Hornacek, Tim Perry and Andrew Lang.54
During Barkley's eight seasons in Philadelphia, he became a household name and was one of the few NBA players to have a figure published by Kenner's Starting Lineup toy line. He also had his own signature shoe line with Nike. His outspoken and aggressive play, however, also caused a few scandals; notoriously a fight with Detroit Pistons center Bill Laimbeer in 1990, an event which drew record fines,55 and the infamous spitting incident.
Spitting incident
In March 1991, during an overtime game in New Jersey, a courtside heckler had been yelling racial epithets throughout the game at Barkley.56 Upset by the heckler's remarks, Barkley turned to spit at him, but, as he later described, did not &quot;get enough foam&quot;, missed and mistakenly spat on a young girl.57 Rod Thorn, the then-NBA's president of operations, suspended Barkley without pay and fined him $10,000 for spitting and using abusive language at the fan.58 It became a national story and Barkley was vilified for it.59 Barkley, however, eventually developed a friendship with the girl and her family.60 He apologized and, among other things, provided tickets to future games.61
Upon retirement, Barkley was later quoted as stating, &quot;I was fairly controversial, I guess, but I regret only one thing&lt;U+2014&gt;the spitting incident. But you know what? It taught me a valuable lesson. It taught me that I was getting way too intense during the game. It let me know I wanted to win way too bad. I had to calm down. I wanted to win at all costs. Instead of playing the game the right way and respecting the game, I only thought about winning.&quot;62
Phoenix Suns
The trade to Phoenix in the 1992&lt;U+2013&gt;93 season went well for both Barkley and the Suns. He averaged 25.6 points on .520 shooting, 12.2 rebounds and a career high 5.1 assists per game,63 leading the Suns to an NBA best 62&lt;U+2013&gt;20 record.64 For his efforts, Barkley won the league's Most Valuable Player Award,65 and was selected to play in his seventh straight All-Star Game. He became the third player ever to win league MVP honors in the season immediately after being traded, established multiple career highs and led Phoenix to their first NBA Finals appearance since 1976.66 Despite Barkley's proclamation to Jordan, that it was &quot;destiny&quot; for the Suns to win the title, they were defeated in six games by the Bulls.67 He averaged 26.6 points and 13.6 rebounds per game during the whole postseason,68 including 27.3 points, 13.0 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game throughout the championship series.69 In the fourth game of the Finals, Barkley recorded a triple-double after collecting 32 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.70
As a result of severe back pains, Barkley began to speculate his last year in Phoenix during the 1993&lt;U+2013&gt;94 season.71 Playing through the worst injury problems of his career, Barkley managed 21.6 points on .495 shooting and 11.2 rebounds per game.72 He was selected to his eighth consecutive All-Star Game, but did not play because of a torn right quadriceps tendon,73 and was named to the All-NBA Second Team. With Barkley fighting injuries, the Suns still managed a 56&lt;U+2013&gt;26 record and made it to the Western Conference Semifinals. Despite holding a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;0 lead in the series,74 however, the Suns lost in seven games to the eventual champion Houston Rockets.94&quot;/&gt; Despite his injuries, in Game 3 of a first-round playoff series against the Golden State Warriors, Barkley hit 23 of 31 field-goal attempts and finished with 56 points, the then-third-highest total ever in a playoff game.7576 After contemplating retirement in the offseason,77 Barkley returned for his eleventh season and continued to battle injuries.78 He struggled during the first half of the season,79 but managed to gradually improve, earning his ninth consecutive appearance in the All-Star Game. He averaged 23 points on .486 shooting and 11.1 rebounds per game,80 while leading the Suns to a 59&lt;U+2013&gt;23 record.81 In the postseason, despite having a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1 lead in the series,82 the Suns once again lost to the defending champion Rockets in seven games.83 Barkley averaged 25.7 points on .500 shooting and 13.4 rebounds per game in the postseason,84 but was limited in Game 7 of the Semifinals by a leg injury.85
The 1995&lt;U+2013&gt;96 season was Barkley's last on the Phoenix Suns. He led the team in scoring, rebounds and steals, averaging 23.3 points on .500 shooting, 11.6 rebounds and a career high .777 free throw shooting.86 He earned his tenth appearance in an All-Star Game as the top vote-getter among Western Conference players and posted his 18th career triple-double on November 22.87 He also became just the tenth player in NBA history to reach 20,000 points and 10,000 rebounds in their career.8889 In the postseason, Barkley averaged 25.5 points and 13.5 rebounds per game in a four-game first round playoff loss to the San Antonio Spurs.9091 After the Suns closed out the season with a 41&lt;U+2013&gt;41 record and a first-round playoff loss, Barkley was traded to Houston in exchange for Sam Cassell, Robert Horry, Mark Bryant and Chucky Brown.92
During his career with the Suns, Barkley excelled as a player, earning All-NBA and All-Star honors in each of his four seasons. The always outspoken Barkley, however, continued to stir up controversy during the 1993 season, when he claimed that sports figures should not be role models.93
Role model controversy
Throughout his career, Barkley had been arguing that athletes should not be considered role models.94 He stated, &quot;A million guys can dunk a basketball in jail; should they be role models?&quot; In 1993, his argument prompted national news when he wrote the text for his &quot;I am not a role model&quot; Nike commercial. Dan Quayle, the former Vice President of the United States, called it a &quot;family-values message&quot; for Barkley's oft-ignored call for parents and teachers to quit looking to him to &quot;raise your kids&quot; and instead be role models themselves.95
Barkley's message sparked a great public debate about the nature of role models. He argued,

I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.96

Houston Rockets
The trade to the Houston Rockets in the 1996&lt;U+2013&gt;97 season was Barkley's last chance at capturing an NBA championship title. He joined a veteran team that included two of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players, Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler. In his first game with the Houston Rockets, Charles Barkley had a career-high thirty-three rebounds.97 He continued to battle injuries throughout the season and played only 53 games, missing fourteen because of a laceration and bruise on his left pelvis, eleven because of a sprained right ankle and four due to suspensions.98 He became the team's second leading scorer, averaging 19.2 points on .484 shooting;99 the first time since his rookie year that he averaged below 20 points per game. With Olajuwon taking most of the shots, Barkley focused primarily on rebounding, averaging 13.5 per game, the second best in his career.100 The Rockets ended the regular season with a 57&lt;U+2013&gt;25 record and advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they were defeated in six games by the Utah Jazz.101 Barkley averaged 17.9 points and 12.0 rebounds per game in another postseason loss.102
The 1997&lt;U+2013&gt;98 season was another injury-plagued year for Barkley. He averaged 15.2 points on .485 shooting and 11.7 rebounds per game.103 The Rockets ended the season with a 41&lt;U+2013&gt;41 record and were eliminated in five games by the Utah Jazz in the first round of the playoffs. Limited by injuries, Barkley played four games and averaged career lows of 9.0 points and 5.3 rebounds in 21.8 minutes per game.104 During the league-lockout-shortened season, Barkley played 42 regular-season games and managed 16.1 points on .478 shooting and 12.3 rebounds per game.105 He became the second player in NBA history, following Wilt Chamberlain, to accumulate 23,000 points, 12,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists in his career.106 The Rockets concluded the shortened season with a 31&lt;U+2013&gt;19 record and advanced to the playoffs.107 In his last postseason appearance, Barkley averaged 23.5 points on .529 shooting and 13.8 rebounds per game in a first-round playoff loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.108 He concluded his postseason career averaging 23 points on .513 shooting, 12.9 rebounds and 3.9 assists per game in 123 games.109
In his final year in the NBA, Barkley's season and career seemingly ended prematurely at the age of 36 after rupturing his left quadriceps tendon on December 8, 1999 in Philadelphia, where his career began.110 Before the injury, Barkley averaged 14.5 points on .477 shooting and 10.5 rebounds per game.111 Refusing to allow his injury to be the last image of his career, Barkley returned after four months for one final game. On April 19, 2000, in a home game against the Vancouver Grizzlies, Barkley scored a memorable basket on an offensive rebound and putback, a common trademark during his career. He accomplished what he set out to do after being activated from the injured list, and walked off the court to a standing ovation.112 He stated, &quot;I can't explain what tonight meant. I did it for me. I've won and lost a lot of games, but the last memory I had was being carried off the court. I couldn't get over the mental block of being carried off the court. It was important psychologically to walk off the court on my own.&quot;113 After the basket, Barkley immediately retired and concluded his sixteen-year NBA Hall of Fame career.
Olympics






Barkley competed in the 1992 and 1996 Olympic games and won two gold medals as a member of the United States men's basketball team. International rules which had previously prevented NBA players from playing in the Olympics were changed in 1992, allowing Barkley and fellow NBA players to compete in the Olympics for the first time. The result was the legendary Dream Team, which went 6&lt;U+2013&gt;0 in the Olympic qualifying tournament and 8&lt;U+2013&gt;0 against Olympic opponents. The team averaged an Olympic record 117.3 points a game and won games by an average of 43.8 points.114 Barkley led the team with 18.0 points on 71.1% field goal shooting and set a then-Olympic single game scoring record with 30 points in a 127&lt;U+2013&gt;83 victory over Brazil.115 He also set a U.S. Men's Olympic record for highest three point field goal percentage with 87.5% and added 4.1 rebounds and 2.6 steals per game.116 Barkley was also part of an ugly moment in the 1992 Olympics when he intentionally elbowed Angola player Herlander Coimbra in the chest during a 116&lt;U+2013&gt;48 rout of that team.117
At the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic Games, Barkley led the team in scoring, rebounds, and field goal percentage. He averaged 12.4 points on 81.6% field goal shooting, setting a U.S. Men's Olympic record.118 In addition, he also contributed 6.6 rebounds per game. Under Barkley's leadership, the team once again compiled a perfect 8&lt;U+2013&gt;0 record and captured gold medal honors.119
Player profile
Barkley played the power forward position but on some occasions he would play the small forward and center positions. He was known for his unusual build as a basketball player, stockier than most small forwards, yet shorter than most power forwards he faced. However, Barkley was still capable of outplaying both taller and quicker opponents because of his strength and agility.120
Barkley was a prolific scorer who averaged 22.1 points-per-game for his season career and 23.0 points-per-game for his playoff career.121 He was one of the NBA's most versatile players and accurate scorers capable of scoring from anywhere on the court and established himself as one of the NBA's premier clutch players.122 During his NBA career, Barkley was a constant mismatch because he possessed a set of very uncommon skills and could play in a variety of positions. He would use all facets of his game in a single play; as a scorer, he had the ability to score from the perimeter and the post, using an array of spin moves and fadeaways, or finishing a fast break with a powerful dunk. He was one of the most efficient scorers of all-time, scoring at 54.13% total field goal percentage for his season career and 51.34% total field goal shooting for his playoff career (including a career season high of 60% during the 1989&lt;U+2013&gt;90 NBA season).123
Frequently listed as 6 feet 6 inches, but measuring slightly under 6 feet 5 inches (1.95 mt),124125 Barkley is the shortest player in NBA history to lead the league in rebounding when he averaged a career high 14.6 rebounds per game during the 1986&lt;U+2013&gt;87 season.126 His tenacious and aggressive form of play built into an undersized frame that fluctuated between  and  helped cement his legacy as one of the greatest rebounders in NBA history, averaging 11.7 rebounds per game in the regular season for his career and 12.9 rebounds per game in his playoff career and totaling 12,546 rebounds for his season career.127 Barkley topped the NBA in offensive rebounding for three straight years128 and was most famous among very few power forwards who could control a defensive rebound, dribble the length of the court and finish at the rim with a powerful dunk.129
Barkley also possessed considerable defensive talents led by an aggressive demeanor, foot speed and his capacity to read the floor to anticipate for steals, a reason why he established his career as the second All-Time leader in steals for the power forward position130 and leader of the highest all-time steal per game average for the power forward position.131 Despite being undersized for both the small forward and power forward positions, he also finished among the all-time leaders in blocked shots.132 His speed and leaping ability made him one of the few power forwards capable of running down court to block a faster player with a chase-down block.133
In a SLAM magazine issue ranking NBA greats, Barkley was ranked among the top 20 players of All-Time. In the magazine, NBA Hall-of-Famer Bill Walton commented on Barkley's ability. Walton stated, &quot;Barkley is like Magic [Johnson] and Larry [Bird] in that they don't really play a position. He plays everything; he plays basketball. There is nobody who does what Barkley does. He's a dominant rebounder, a dominant defensive player, a three-point shooter, a dribbler, a playmaker.&quot;134
Legacy
During his 16-year NBA career, Barkley was regarded as one of the most controversial, outspoken and dominating players in the history of basketball. His impact on the sport went beyond his rebounding titles, assists, scoring and physical play.135 His larger than life persona and confrontational mannerisms often led to technical fouls and fines and sometimes gave rise to national controversy, such as when he was featured in ads that rejected pro athletes as role models and declared, &quot;I am not a role model.&quot;136 Although his words often led to controversy, according to Barkley his mouth was never the cause because it always spoke the truth.137 He stated, &quot;I don't create controversies. They're there long before I open my mouth. I just bring them to your attention.&quot;138
Barkley was frequently fined for on-court fights with NBA players, such as Shaquille O'Neal, Bill Laimbeer, and Charles Oakley, among others.139 He was also equally confrontational off the court. He was arrested for breaking a man's nose during a fight after a game with the Milwaukee Bucks140 and also for throwing a man through a plate-glass window after being struck with a glass of ice.141 Notwithstanding these occurrences, Barkley continued to remain popular with the fans and media because of his sense of humor and honesty.
As a player, Barkley was a perennial All-Star who earned league MVP honors in 1993.142 He employed a physical style of play that earned him the nicknames &quot;Sir Charles&quot; and &quot;The Round Mound of Rebound&quot;.143 He was named to the All-NBA team eleven times and earned two gold medals as a member of the United States Olympic Basketball team. He led both teams in scoring and was instrumental in helping the 1992 &quot;Dream Team&quot; and 1996 Men's Basketball team compile a perfect 16&lt;U+2013&gt;0 record.144145 He retired as one of only four players in NBA history to record at least 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists in their career146, although a fifth player, Kevin Garnett, has since accomplished that feat.
In recognition of his collegiate and NBA achievements, Barkley's number 34 jersey was officially retired by Auburn University on March 3, 2001. In the same month, the Philadelphia 76ers also officially retired Barkley's jersey.147 On 20 March 2004, the Phoenix Suns honored Barkley as well by retiring his jersey and including him in the &quot;Suns Ring of Honor&quot;.148 In recognition of his achievements as a player, Barkley was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006.149

Turner Network Television (TNT)
Since 2000, Barkley has served as a studio analyst for Turner Network Television (TNT).150151 He appears on the network's NBA coverage during pre-game and halftime shows, in addition to special NBA events. He also appears on an original program for the network entitled Inside the NBA, a post-game show during which Barkley, Ernie Johnson Jr. and Kenny Smith recap and comment on NBA games that have occurred during the day and also on general NBA affairs.152
During the broadcast of a game, in which Barkley was courtside with Marv Albert, Barkley poked fun at NBA official Dick Bavetta's age. Albert replied to Barkley, &quot;I believe Dick would beat you in a footrace.&quot; In response to that remark, Barkley went on to challenge Bavetta to a race at the 2007 NBA All-Star Weekend for $5,000. The winner was to choose a charity to which the money would be donated. The NBA agreed to pitch in an additional $50,000, and TNT threw in $25,000. The pair raced for three and a half lengths of the basketball court until Barkley ultimately won. After the event, the two embraced in a show of good sportsmanship.153
Gambling
Barkley is known for his compulsive gambling. In an interview with ESPN's Trey Wingo, Barkley revealed that he lost approximately $10 million through gambling.154 In addition, he also admitted to losing $2.5 million, &quot;in a six-hour period&quot;, while playing blackjack.155 Although Barkley openly admits to his problem, he claims it is not serious since he can afford to support the habit.156 When approached by fellow TNT broadcaster Ernie Johnson about the issue, Barkley replied, &quot;It's not a problem. If you're a drug addict or an alcoholic, those are problems. I gamble for too much money. As long as I can continue to do it I don't think it's a problem. Do I think it's a bad habit? Yes, I think it's a bad habit. Am I going to continue to do it? Yes, I'm going to continue to do it.&quot;157
Despite suffering big losses, Barkley also claims to have won on several occasions. During a trip to Las Vegas, he claims to have won $700,000 from playing blackjack and betting on the Indianapolis Colts to defeat the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI.158 He went on to state, however, &quot;No matter how much I win it ain't a lot. It's only a lot when I lose. And you always lose. I think it's fun, I think it's exciting. I'm gonna continue to do it but I have to get to a point where I don't try to break the casino 'cause you never can.&quot;159
In May 2008, the Wynn Las Vegas casino filed a civil complaint against Barkley, alleging that he had failed to pay a $400,000 debt stemming from October 2007. Barkley responded by taking blame for letting time lapse on the repayment of the debt and promptly paid the casino.160 After repaying his debt, Barkley stated during a pregame show on TNT, &quot;I've got to stop gambling...I am not going to gamble anymore. For right now, the next year or two, I'm not going to gamble... Just because I can afford to lose money doesn't mean I should do it.&quot;161
Politics
Barkley spoke for many years of his Republican Party affiliation. In 1995, he considered running as a Republican candidate for Alabama's governorship in the 1998 election.162 However, in 2006, he altered his political stance.163 At a July 2006 meeting of the Southern Regional Conference of the National School Boards Association in Destin, Florida, Barkley lent credence to the idea of running for Governor of Alabama, stating:

I'm serious. I've got to get people to realize that the government is full of it. Republicans and Democrats want to argue over stuff that's not important, like gay marriage or the war in Iraq or illegal immigration... When I run &lt;U+2014&gt; if I run &lt;U+2014&gt; we're going to talk about real issues like improving our schools, cleaning up our neighborhoods of drugs and crime and making Alabama a better place for all people.164

In September 2006, Barkley once again reiterated his desire to run for Governor. He noted, &quot;I can't run until 2014 ... I have to live there for seven years, so I'm looking for a house there as we speak.&quot;165 In July 2007, he made a video declaring his support for Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential election.166 In September 2007, during a broadcast on Monday Night Football, Barkley announced that he bought a house in Alabama to satisfy residency requirements for a 2014 campaign for governor. In addition, Barkley declared himself an Independent and not a Democrat as previously reported. &quot;The Republicans are full of it,&quot; Barkley said, &quot;The Democrats are a little less full of it.&quot;167
In February 2008, Barkley announced that he would be running for Governor of Alabama in 2014 as an Independent. On October 27, 2008, he officially announced his candidacy for Governor of Alabama in an interview with CNN, stating that he planned to run in the 2014 election cycle,168 but he began to back off the idea in a November 24, 2009 interview on The Jay Leno Show.169
Books
In 2000, Barkley wrote the foreword for Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly's book The Life of Reilly. In it, Barkley quipped, &quot;Of all the people in sports I'd like to throw through a plate glass window, Reilly's not one of them. It's a shame though, skinny white boys look real aerodynamic.&quot;170 In 2002, Barkley released the book I May Be Wrong, But I Doubt It, which included editing and commentary by close friend Michael Wilbon.171 Three years later, Barkley released Who's Afraid of a Large Black Man?, which is a collection of interviews with leading figures in entertainment, business, sports, and government. Michael Wilbon also contributed to this book and was present at many of the interviews.172
DUI conviction
On December 31, 2008, Barkley was pulled over in Scottsdale, Arizona, for initially running a stop sign.173 Officers smelled alcohol on Barkley's breath and proceeded to administer field sobriety tests, which he failed. He was arrested on drunk driving charges and had his vehicle impounded. Barkley refused to submit a breath test and was given a blood test.174 He was then cited and released.175 Gilbert police noted Barkley was cooperative and respectful during the entire incident, adding that he was treated no differently than anyone arrested on DUI charges.176 The police report of the incident stated that Barkley told police he was in a hurry to receive oral sex from his female passenger when he ran through a stop sign early Wednesday.177 Test results released by police showed that Barkley had a blood-alcohol level at .149, nearly twice the legal limit of .08 in Arizona.178 Two months after his arrest, Barkley pleaded guilty to two DUI-related counts and one count of running a red light. He was sentenced to ten days in jail and fined $2,000.179 The sentence was later reduced to three days after Barkley entered an alcohol treatment program.180
As part of the fallout of his arrest, Barkley took a two-month hiatus from his commentating duties for TNT.181 During his absence, T-Mobile elected not to air previously scheduled ads that featured Barkley, stating, &quot;Given the recent developments, for the time being, we've replaced TV ads featuring Mr. Barkley with more general-market advertising.&quot;182 On February 19, 2009, Barkley returned to TNT and spent the first segment of the NBA pregame show discussing the incident and his experiences.183 Shortly after his return, T-Mobile once again began airing ads featuring Barkley.
The Haney Project
Barkley is well known for his fondness of golf. However, his swing is often regarded as one of the most bizarre and broken swings in the sport.184 Barkley's swing unravels after he brings his club back. He starts to take it forward then jerks to a stop, throwing his body off balance, before wildly striking at the ball.185 Once a 10-handicap golfer who could break 80, Barkley can no longer break 100 and finished last at the American Century Celebrity Golf Championship in July 2008.186
A reality series known as &quot;The Haney Project&quot; premiered on The Golf Channel starring Charles Barkley and Hank Haney, one of the world's top golf instructors.187 The show centers on Hank Haney attempting to use his renowned expertise and teaching methods to fix Barkley's swing.188 Haney believes he can help Barkley lower his handicap and notes that Barkley's short game is strong and that his putting is even stronger.189
Personal life
Barkley married Maureen Blumhardt, a woman of European descent, in 1989. The two had a daughter together, Christiana.190
