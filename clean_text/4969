Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner (27 May 1885 â€“ 12 February 1961) served in the United States Navy during World War II.
Early life and career
Turner was born in Portland, Oregon on May 27, 1885. Appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy from California in 1904, he graduated in June 1908 and served in several ships over the next four years. In 1913, Lieutenant (Junior Grade) Turner briefly held command of the destroyer Stewart. After receiving instruction in ordnance engineering and service on board the gunboat Marietta, he was assigned to the battleships Pennsylvania, Michigan and Mississippi during 1916-19.
From 1919 to 1922, Lieutenant Commander Turner was an Ordnance Officer at the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C. He then was Gunnery Officer of the battleship California, Fleet Gunnery Officer on the Staff of Commander Scouting Fleet and Commanding Officer of the destroyer USS Mervine (DD-322). Following promotion to the rank of Commander in 1925, Turner served with the Bureau of Ordnance at the Navy Department. In 1927, he received flight training at Pensacola, Florida, and a year later became Commanding Officer of the seaplane tender USS Jason (AC-12) and Commander Aircraft Squadrons, Asiatic Fleet. He had further aviation-related assignments into the 1930s and was Executive Officer of the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga (CV-3) in 1933-34. Captain Turner attended the Naval War College and served on that institution's staff in 1935-38 as head of the Strategy faculty. He next commanded the heavy cruiser USS Astoria (CA-34) and took her on a diplomatic mission to Japan in 1939.
Pearl Harbor
Captain Turner was Director of War Plans in Washington, D.C., in 1940-41 and achieved the rank of Rear Admiral late in the latter year.
Edwin T. Layton (later Rear Admiral Layton), Chief Intelligence Officer to Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, Commander of the Pacific Fleet, in his book, &quot;And I Was There: Pearl Harbor and Midway -- Breaking the Secrets&quot; (1985) makes the case that Turner was in fact the main person culpable in the Pearl Harbor disaster -- although Turner's boss Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Harold R. Stark, also comes in for a share of the blame -- and argues persuasively that Kimmel, and his Army equivalent, General Walter C. Short, were scapegoats for higher-ups.
Layton lays several main charges at Turner&lt;U+2019&gt;s door:

a) Turner totally misread Japanese war plans, believing far into 1941 that Japan was going to invade Siberia, not SE Asia and islands in the Pacific;
b) when Japan&lt;U+2019&gt;s intentions in these areas started to become more evident, he failed to appreciate the significance of decrypted Japanese messages and continued to discount any attack on American forces, particularly those in Pearl Harbor;
c) when he did eventually have worries, they were for the Philippines (at least 4,000 miles further west from Pearl) and the US Navy&lt;U+2019&gt;s Asiatic Fleet, not for its Pacific Fleet (despite what Turner testified to at official hearings); and
d) most seriously, he monopolized intelligence information, dolled out little of it, and failed to provide Kimmel, in particular, with vital data needed in the run up to the attack.

The Navy&lt;U+2019&gt;s Washington headquarters contained three offices dealing with intelligence: Office of Naval Communications (ONC), Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), and the War Plans Division, headed by Turner. An older fight between the first two as to which would analyze and disseminate decrypted information was settled when ONI was given the lead. According to Layton, Turner, however, later used the authority of his boss, Stark, to cut off ONI&lt;U+2019&gt;s direct access to field commands and to promote himself and his own office to this particular job, which he then failed to perform adequately. As Admiral Dyer, Turner's biographer, notes (see External Link, below), Turner took the position at the Congressional Inquiry in 1945 that his office &quot;never sent out information.&quot; Layton argues that Turner also, however, cut off ONI from sending it out, while Stark dithered. Dyer says that Turner's seizure of function from ONI created a &quot;gap&quot; between analysis and communication, and Dyer implies that the communication of vital information got swallowed up in that gap, so that Kimmel was largely in the dark.
Layton makes it clear that the high level Japanese naval codes were not broken at the time of Pearl, but that useful information could be obtained from &lt;U+201C&gt;traffic analysis&lt;U+201D&gt; &lt;U+2013&gt; who sent messages to whom and how often -- from partial decryptions, as well as from incidental pieces of information that helped confirm or disconfirm analyses. But diplomatic cyphers, including the highest level, Purple, were broken and regularly read. Turner, however, shared little or none of this diplomatic traffic with Pacific Command. Layton, pp. 73, 76, 90, 286.
Diplomatic decrypts revealed the day to day hardening of the mindset of the militarists in control of the Japanese government, particularly the sharp descent in the period after the Japanese Combined Fleet set sail for Pearl Harbor (despite some revisionist thinking, it is generally still believed that the fleet observed radio silence throughout the voyage)(see http://www.nybooks.com/articles/14086 for further on this).
Most significantly, the diplomatic traffic revealed something that was of critical importance to those in command at Pearl, but which was never conveyed to them: Japanese Intelligence had, during the period prior to the attack, asked the spy it had sent to Honolulu, Takeo Yoshikawa, to divide the waters of Pearl Harbor into a grid. He was to report &quot;six DDs section AA&quot; instead of &quot;six destroyers in the area northwest of Ford Island&quot;, and he did so report. These are sometimes referred to as &quot;bomb plot&quot; messages or &lt;U+201C&gt;Kita messages&lt;U+201D&gt; (after the name of the consul). They were obviously designed as efficient aids to targeting torpedoes and bombs. Neither Admiral Kimmel nor General Short were told about these messages. The Japanese also had the Panama Canal and the Philippines under surveillance, but Pearl Harbor was the only installation divided into a grid in this way.
So, right under their noses, Kimmel and Short had a spy providing accurate information on a daily basis about local bombing targets, but neither commander was provided the ability to inhale that something rotten in Pearl. They were not able to do this because of policies (largely unwritten) established by Turner, with the acquiesence of Stark. In late November 1941, both the Navy and Army sent &quot;war warnings&quot; to all Pacific commands. Although these stated the high probability of imminent war with Japan, and instructed recipients to be on alert for war, the focus was on the Far East. Pearl Harbor was not mentioned. Washington's war warning messages have been criticised by some (e.g., the US Army Pearl Harbor Board - &quot;Do/Don't Messages&quot;) as containing &quot;conflicting and imprecise&quot; language. Washington did not solicit the views of the Hawaiian commanders or ask if they had special concerns. See Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge debate
The truth is that everyone expected the attack to come in the Philippines, where MacArthur had been sent and where B-17 Flying Fortress bombers were being sent. MacArthur, also, is accused of serious failures by Layton, principal among them being that despite having access to the Purple decrypts denied Kimmel, he underestimated the threat of attack, overestimated the strength of his forces, and then failed to take appropriate action &lt;U+2013&gt; even after having learned nine hours before the attack on his positions began that the attack on Pearl Harbor had occurred. Layton, p. 76.
Layton also maintains that Turner joined in the persecution of Kimmel in order to cover up his own failures &lt;U+2013&gt; and culpability. Early in the book (pp. 19-21), he recounts an incident in the wardroom of Nimitz&lt;U+2019&gt;s flagship, on the first night after peace had been declared, when he (Layton) was playing cards with other officers. As Layton notes, Turner by that time &lt;U+201C&gt;had executed all our landing operations from Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima with brilliant distinction&lt;U+201D&gt;, despite his &lt;U+201C&gt;stormy temper, overbearing ego, and celebrated bouts with the bottle.&lt;U+201D&gt; &lt;U+201C&gt;Stoked up,&lt;U+201D&gt; Turner stormed into the wardroom and propounded that the Pearl Harbor court of inquiry had determined that &lt;U+201C&gt;goddammed Kimmel had all the information and didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t do anything about it. They should hang him higher than a kite!&lt;U+201D&gt; Layton protests. &lt;U+201C&gt;But Kimmel did not have that information. You say that he did. I know that he did not, and I was there.&lt;U+201D&gt; Instead of entering into a reasonable discussion on the finer points of naval intelligence (this is a joke), Turner came &lt;U+201C&gt;roaring across the room, bellowing, &lt;U+2018&gt;Are you calling me a liar?&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+201D&gt; Fisticuffs were avoided only by the swift intervention of the flagship&lt;U+2019&gt;s skipper, Captain Ernest P. Forrestel.
Post Pearl
Turner was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet (a new position created after Pearl Harbor for Admiral King) from December 1941 until June 1942 and was then sent to the Pacific war zone to take command of the Amphibious Force, South Pacific Force.
A website devoted to naval communications intelligence (www.centuryinter.net/midway/priceless/footnotes.html#note84) contains this note #65 in an article by Frederick D. Parker:

Guadalcanal, First Major Amphibious Operation
Layton (p. 458 ff.) significantly modifies his earlier statement about Turner&lt;U+2019&gt;s &lt;U+201C&gt;brilliant execution&lt;U+201D&gt;, by inference if not explicitly, when he describes Turner&lt;U+2019&gt;s conduct at Guadalcanal, &lt;U+201C&gt;our first major amphibious operation.&lt;U+201D&gt;
Layton begins by setting the stage, describing how the Japanese were taken by surprise when US marines landed at Tulagi and Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942. The marines seized control of the airstrip being constructed, but this initial victory was followed over the next six months by &lt;U+201C&gt;a bitter campaign of attrition.&lt;U+201D&gt; Admiral Yamamoto responded to the landings within forty-eight hours, dispatching forces sufficient to cause the cautious Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher, in overall command of a force which included air support commanded by Admiral Leigh Noyes, to make &lt;U+201C&gt;the independent decision,&lt;U+201D&gt; supported by Noyes, &lt;U+201C&gt;to withdraw his forces to the south for refueling.&lt;U+201D&gt; These forces included carriers Saratoga, Wasp, and Enterprise. This decision meant that Turner&lt;U+2019&gt;s transports no longer had air cover, a situation which of course &lt;U+201C&gt;enormously increased the vulnerability of Turner&lt;U+2019&gt;s transports,&quot; which were still unloading supplies.

He protested Fletcher&lt;U+2019&gt;s decision, but

Layton calls this error &lt;U+201C&gt;understandable&lt;U+201D&gt;, given the information actually available to him:

Admiral Gunichi Mikawa&lt;U+2019&gt;s heavy cruisers &lt;U+201C&gt;swept in from the darkness north of Savo Island and set the night ablaze in a twenty-minute gunnery duel that sank four Allied cruisers and a destroyer.&lt;U+201D&gt; Only because Mikawa withdrew thereafter, fearing that US carriers were near, were Turner&lt;U+2019&gt;s transports &lt;U+201C&gt;saved from complete destruction.&lt;U+201D&gt;
When the enemy stepped up their bombing raids from Rabaul the following morning, Turner withdrew his transports and a surviving cruiser, thereby stranding the 6000 marines on Tulagi and the 10,000 marines on Guadalcanal, equipped only with some entrenching tools and less than one month&lt;U+2019&gt;s rations and medical supplies. The marines, however, responded by completing the airstrip (renamed Henderson field in honor of Lofton Henderson a heroic marine aviator who had died at the Battle of Midway, using the one bulldozer on the island, a Japanese bulldozer; this enabled the Navy to fly in food and supplies. The rest of the story belongs to the article on the Guadalcanal campaign.
After Guadalcanal
Over the next three years, while holding a variety of senior Pacific Fleet amphibious force commands as both a Rear Admiral and Vice Admiral, he helped plan and execute the conquest of enemy positions in the south, central and western Pacific.
In the rank of Admiral, he would have commanded the amphibious component of the invasion of Japan, had that nation not capitulated after atomic bombs were dropped on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.
Postwar
Following the end of World War II, Admiral Turner served on the Navy Department's General Board and was U.S. Naval Representative on the United Nations Military Staff Committee. He retired from active duty in July 1947. Admiral Richmond K. Turner died in Monterey, California. He is buried in Golden Gate National Cemetery in San Bruno, California alongside his wife and Admirals Chester Nimitz, Raymond A. Spruance, and Charles A. Lockwood, an arrangement made by all of them while living.
Namesake
The guided missile frigate (later cruiser) Richmond K. Turner (DLG-20, later CG-20) was named in honor of him.
