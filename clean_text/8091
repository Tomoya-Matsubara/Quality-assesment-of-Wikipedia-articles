Disembowelment is a compilation of all the recorded material by the Australian death/doom band Disembowelment. It was released on 28 June 2005 by Relapse Records as a two-CD set in a gatefold package with the band's logo embossed on the cover. Included with the album was a booklet featuring an extensive biography of the band written by drummer Paul Mazziotta. A limited edition of the album contained a third CD comprising four tracks, one of which is a cover of the Necrovore song &quot;Slaughtered Remains&quot;. It was also issued as a triple LP by 3XM Productions in a limited edition of 500. Disc One of this collection is the band's 1993 album Transcendence Into The Peripheral in its entirety. Disc Two is composed of the 1992 EP Dusk (tracks 1 - 3), an early version of the song &quot;Excoriated&quot; titled &quot;Extracted Nails&quot; that featured only on a compilation album called Pantalgia from 1991 and the remainder is the complete 1990 demo &quot;Mourning September&quot;.
