Buena Vista Social Club is a studio album by Cuban bandleader and musician Juan de Marcos Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez and American guitarist Ry Cooder with traditional Cuban musicians, released September 16, 1997 on World Circuit Records. The album was produced by Cooder who travelled to Cuba to record sessions with the musicians, many of whom were previously largely unknown outside Cuba. The musicians and the songs were later also featured in a documentary film of the same name. The music featured on the album was inspired by the Buena Vista Social Club, a membership club that was at its height during the 1940s and 1950s. Many of the musicians performing on the record were either former performers at the club or were prominent Cuban musicians during the era of the club's existence. Other younger musicians on the record trace their musical roots back to pre-revolutionary Cuban music, mainly the famous Havana musical scene of the 1950s.
Buena Vista Social Club started a craze in the Western World for Latin American music, particularly Cuban music, while it also earned a considerable amount of critical praise and has received numerous accolades from several music writers and publications.1 In 2003, the album was ranked number 260 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time,2 one of only two albums on the list to be produced in a non-English speaking country.
Conception
Background
In 1996, American guitarist Ry Cooder had been invited to Havana by British world music producer Nick Gold of World Circuit Records to record a session where two African High-life musicians from Mali were to collaborate with Cuban musicians.3 On Cooder's arrival (via Mexico to avoid the ongoing U.S. trade and travel embargo against Cuba),4 it transpired that the musicians from Africa had not received their visas and were unable to travel to Havana. Cooder and Gold changed their plans and decided to record an album of Cuban son music with local musicians.5 Already on board the African collaboration project were Cuban musicians including bassist Orlando &quot;Cachaito&quot; L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez, guitarist Eliades Ochoa and musical director Juan de Marcos Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez, who had himself been organizing a similar project for the Afro-Cuban All Stars. A search for additional musicians led the team to singer Manuel &quot;Puntillita&quot; Licea, pianist Rub&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez and octogenarian singer Compay Segundo, who all agreed to record for the project.6
Within three days of the project's birth, Cooder, Gold and de Marcos had organized a large group of performers and arranged for recording sessions to commence at Havana's EGREM Studios, formerly owned by RCA records, where the equipment and atmosphere had remained unchanged since the 1950s.7 Communication between the Spanish and English speakers at the studio was conducted via an interpreter, although Cooder reflected that &quot;musicians understand each other through means other than speaking&quot;.8
Recording
The album was recorded in just six days and contained fourteen tracks; opening with &quot;Chan Chan&quot; written by Compay Segundo, a four chord son that was to become what Cooder described as &quot;the Buena Vista's calling card&quot;;9 and ending with a rendition of &quot;La Bayamesa&quot;, a traditional Cuban patriotic song (not to be confused with the Cuban national anthem of the same name).10 The sessions also produced material for the subsequent release, Introducing... Rub&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez, which showcased the work of the Cuban pianist.11

Music
&quot;Chan Chan&quot;, the first song on the album, is a Cuban song composition by Compay Segundo, revolving around two central characters, Juanita and Chan Chan.12 The song was one of Compay's last compositions and was written in 1987.13 &quot;Chan Chan&quot; was recorded by Segundo himself various times as well as by many other Latin artists. &quot;El cuarto de Tula&quot; was composed by Gonzales Y Siaba Sergio Eulogio(1916 - 1989). It is sung by Eliades Ochoa with Ibrahim Ferrer and Manuel &quot;Puntillita&quot; Licea joining Ochoa in an extended descarga (jam) section improvising lyrics. Barbarito Torres plays a frenetic lute solo towards the end of the track. Timbales are played by the 13 year old Julienne Oviedo S&lt;U+00E1&gt;nchez.14 &quot;Dos gardenias&quot; is a bolero sung by Ibrahim Ferrer. The song was written by Isolina Carillo in the 1930s and became a huge success in the 1940s. The song was chosen for the album after Cooder heard Ferrer and Rub&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez improvising the melody before a recording session. Ferrer learned the song whilst playing with Cuban bandleader Beny Mor&lt;U+00E9&gt;.15 &quot;&lt;U+00BF&gt;Y t&lt;U+00FA&gt; qu&lt;U+00E9&gt; has hecho?&quot; was written 1920s by Eusebio Delf&lt;U+00ED&gt;n and features his friend Compay Segundo on tres and vocals. Segundo was traditionally a &quot;second voice&quot; singer providing a baritone counterpoint harmony. On the Buena Vista Social Club recording of &quot;&lt;U+00BF&gt;Y t&lt;U+00FA&gt; qu&lt;U+00E9&gt; has hecho?&quot;, he multitracks both voices. The song also features a duet between Segundo on tres and Ry Cooder on guitar.16
&quot;Veinte a&lt;U+00F1&gt;os&quot; is a bolero written by Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Teresa Vera and is sung on the Buena Vista album by the only female in the ensemble, Omara Portuondo with Segundo providing baritone.17 &quot;El carretero&quot; is a guajira (country lament) sung by Eliades Ochoa with the full ensemble providing additional instruments and backing vocals. &quot;Candela&quot; is a popular song written by Faustino Oramas with lyrics rich with sexual innuendo. On the album it is sung by Ibrahim Ferrer who improvises vocal lines throughout the track, and the whole ensemble perform an extended descarga. The title track, &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot;, was written by bass player Cacha&lt;U+00ED&gt;to&lt;U+2019&gt;s father, Orestes L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez.18 The song spotlighted the piano work of Rub&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez and it was recorded after Cooder heard Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez improvising around the tune's musical theme before a day's recording session. After playing the tune, Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez explained to Cooder the history of the social club and that the song was the club's &quot;mascot tune&quot;.19 When searching for a name for the overall project, manager Nick Gold chose the song's title. According to Cooder, &quot;It should be the thing that sets it apart. It was a kind of club by then. Everybody was hanging out and we had rum and coffee around two in the afternoon. It felt like a club, so let&lt;U+2019&gt;s call it that. That&lt;U+2019&gt;s what gave it a handle.&quot;20
