Richmond High School is a public high school in Richmond, Indiana, located at 380 Hub Etchison Parkway. It is the home of the Richmond Red Devils, who are members of the North Central Conference of the Indiana High School Athletic Association (IHSAA). The current enrollment of the school is around 1,700. Prior to 1939, the school was known as Morton High School in honor of Indiana's Civil War Governor, Oliver P. Morton.
Facilities
 Completed in 1939, the Colonial revival-style school consisted of an academic building called Morton Hall, a gymnasium called Civic Hall which is now the Civic Hall Performing Arts Center, an auditorium which seats 924 and McGuire Hall which houses the Richmond Art Museum, believed to be the only public art museum connected with a public high school. An icon of the museum collection is a very large self portrait of the American impressionist William Merritt Chase painted for the museum in 1915-16. After outgrowing the Civic Hall gymnasium, the Tiernan Center was built as the home to boys and girls basketball, volleyball, and wrestling. It is the fifth largest high school gym in the United States, with a seating capacity of 8,100 persons.
The Richmond High School Alumni Association is one of the oldest public high school alumni associations in the United States and boasts a significant scholarship endowment known as the Richmond College Incentive Plan.
Music Department
The Music Department at Richmond High School is a multi-million dollar facility that is named Civic Hall. It contains an orchestra, band, and choir room, but also contains a stageroom that is used for the Richmond Symphony Orchestra, various performances, speeches, and for school assemblies.
Orchestra
The orchestra department at Richmond High was the first high school orchestra in the nation, established in the year 1899 by Will Earhart. A plaque commemorating this achievement is located in McGuire Hall. The orchestra program is currently under the direction of Keith Ziolkowski.
Band
Wind Ensemble and Concert Band
The band, during the school year, is divided into two parts: a Wind Ensemble and a Concert Band. The band is large enough to divide the better players into a separate group so that they may perform at a higher level. Richmond&lt;U+2019&gt;s wind ensemble is a high-level instrumental performing group. The band has performed at ISSMA during the years 2002-2007. They perform at a group one level, the highest out of four. The concert band, a lower division of Richmond's Band, performs at a level three.
Marching Band
The Marching band at RHS has competed at the Indiana State Fair Band Day since 1959 with the exception of 1984 and 1997. Some accomplishments include 1st place in the state competition in 1973 and 1988 and 2nd place in the state competition in 1965, 1986, 2003, 2006, and 2011. Recent shows include &lt;U+201C&gt;Miss Saigon,&lt;U+201D&gt; &lt;U+201C&gt;Circ du Soleil,&lt;U+201D&gt; music from &lt;U+201C&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean,&lt;U+201D&gt; &lt;U+201C&gt;Music from Disney&lt;U+2019&gt;s &lt;U+201C&gt;Reflections,&lt;U+201D&gt; and in 2006 &lt;U+201C&gt;One Track Mind.&lt;U+201D&gt; The 2006 show received third place and two captions: General Effect caption and the overall Percussion caption. The marching Red Devils also won a third place in 2007 with &quot;Chaos and Order&quot; music from Conan the Barbarian. In 2008, Richmond Red Devils won 2nd place with &quot;There Can Be Only One&quot;. And in 2009, 5th place was awarded with their show &quot;The Phoenix&quot;. 2009 was the 50th year that Richmond High School's Red Devil marching band has competed at the Indiana State Fair.
Choir
The RHS choir program has been very successful, with the top group (Chamber Choir) competing at the Indiana Concert Choir State Finals and placing in the top-16 every year since 1997. In 2006, the group received their highest ever ranking of sixth place. In 2007, Chamber Choir placed 10th at the State Finals.
