The 2013 CECAFA Cup (known as the GOtv CECAFA Challenge Cup for sponsorship reasons)1 was the 37th edition of the annual CECAFA Cup, an international football competition consisting of the national teams of member nations of the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations (CECAFA). The tournament was held in Kenya from 27 November to 12 December.
Contested by twelve national teams, the tournament had Zambia invited as a guest nation to fill in for Djibouti, who failed to participate for a second consecutive year. This followed the tournament's recent tradition of inviting other African nations to take part once a CECAFA nation pulled out; Malawi were invited to take part in the previous edition held in Uganda,2 while they and Zimbabwe took part in 2011 after Eritrea withdrew from the competition.34
Hosts Kenya ran out 2&lt;U+2013&gt;0 winners in the final against three-time champions Sudan, with a brace from Allan Wanga securing the Harambee Stars their sixth title after losing to previous hosts Uganda at the same stage the previous year.56 The third place playoff was won by guests Zambia, who beat Tanzania 6&lt;U+2013&gt;5 on penalties after playing out to a 1&lt;U+2013&gt;1 draw after 90 minutes.7
Background and sponsorship
On 25 November 2012, it was announced that Kenya was chosen to host the tournament after bids were placed by the host nation as well as Rwanda.8 However, their hosting of the tournament was not confirmed until a congress meeting for the Confederation of African Football held in Marrakesh, Morocco on 11 March 2013, after it was announced that the Football Kenya Federation had met all the requirements for hosting the tournaments with support from the Kenyan government.9 The capital city Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Machakos and Nakuru were identified as host cities for the tournament.10
On 21 November 2013, CECAFA announced that GOtv would be the title sponsors of the tournament, having committed Ksh. 11.25 million towards the organisation of the event and a further Ksh. 45 million towards the broadcasting of all 26 matches. Other companies that were sponsoring the tournament were Coca-Cola, who committed Ksh. 6.5 million, and UAP Insurance, who committed Ksh. 5.5 million.111213
Of Ksh. 8.7 million (approx. US$ 100,000) that was allocated for prize money, the winners were to receive Ksh. 5.6 million, while the runners-up were to take home Ksh. 2.5 million. The third place playoff winners were to receive Ksh. 600,000.14
Participants
The draw for teams to participate in the tournament was held during the tournament's launch on 15 November 2013.151617 Alongside the 12 member nations of CECAFA, Ivory Coast, Malawi and Zambia were initially mooted as invitees for the tournament.18 However, CECAFA decided against inviting the Ivory Coast, with Secretary-General Nicholas Musonye saying that flying in Les &lt;U+00C9&gt;l&lt;U+00E9&gt;phants and keeping them in the country would cost the organisers over US$ 25,000.19 The Football Association of Malawi decided not to enter a team for the tournament due to a lack of funds.20
