New Jersey's 22nd Legislative District is one of 40 in the state, covering the Middlesex County municipality of Dunellen Borough and Middlesex Borough, the Somerset County localities of Green Brook Township and North Plainfield Borough, and the Union County municipalities of Clark Township, Fanwood Borough, Linden City, Plainfield City, Rahway City, Scotch Plains Township and Winfield Township.1 As of the 2000 United States Census, the district had a population of 207,037.2
Changes to the district made as part of the New Jersey Legislative redistricting in 2001, based on the results of the 2000 United States Census added Middlesex Borough and Plainfield City (from the 17th Legislative District), Rahway City (from the 20th Legislative District) and Linden City (from the 21st Legislative District) and removed Berkeley Heights Township, Chatham Township, Cranford Township, Garwood Borough, Long Hill Township, Mountainside Borough, New Providence Borough, Warren Township, Watchung Borough and Westfield Town (to the 21st Legislative District).3
Demographic characteristics
The district has the 8th highest percentage of African American residents of all 40 districts statewide. The municipal tax rate is 11th highest and school taxes are 12th highest leading to one of the highest overall tax rates, after including rebates, which was the 7th highest in the state. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 5-2 margin.45
Political representation
The district is represented in the New Jersey Senate by Nicholas Scutari (D, Linden) and in the New Jersey General Assembly by Jerry Green (D, Plainfield) and Linda Stender (D, Fanwood).6
Election history
Facing challenges from the Democrats, the team of Peter McDonough in the Senate and Donald DiFrancesco and William J. Maguire in the Assembly won re-election in 1977.7 In the wake of redistricting following the 1980 United States Census, McDonough chose not to run for re-election, setting off a 1981 primary battle between Assemblymembers DiFrancesco and Maguire. DiFrancesco won the Senate seat while Bob Franks and Maureen Ogden won election in the Assembly.8
In redistricting following the 1990 United States Census, Maureen Ogden was switched to the 21st District, where she won election to the Assembly, and Richard Bagger won the now-vacant ballot spot in the 22nd District.
Alan Augustine left office as of March 31, 2001, just several weeks before his death, due to health problems, and was succeeded by Thomas Kean, Jr.9
As of January 21, 2001, DiFrancesco became the 51st Governor of New Jersey after Christine Todd Whitman left office to become Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, with DiFrancesco simultaneously holding his post as Senate President. In the 2001 redistricting following the 2000 United States Census, several of the suburban, Republican-leaning municipalities in the district were replaced by Linden, Plainfield and Rahway, which gave the district a distinct Democratic tilt. Bagger and Kean were relocated to the 21st District and the three legislative seats were taken by Democrats Joseph Suliga in the Senate and Jerry Green and Linda Stender in the Assembly.
Suliga did not run for re-election in 2003 after a scandal involving his alleged drunken sexual harassment of a woman in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He resigned and entered rehabilitation for alcoholism and was replaced on the ballot and in the Senate by fellow Linden Democrat Nicholas Scutari.10
