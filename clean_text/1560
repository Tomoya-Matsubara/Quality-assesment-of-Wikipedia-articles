Henry de Sully was a medieval Abbot of F&lt;U+00E9&gt;camp and Bishop-designate of Salisbury and Archbishop-elect of York.
Life
Henry was the son of William, count of Chartres the eldest brother of King Stephen of England and Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester.1 Henry's mother was William's wife Agnes who had been attached to the household of Adela of Blois, William's mother. Although William was the eldest son of Adela and her husband Stephen II, Count of Blois, he was passed over for the comital title and his younger brother Theobald became Count of Champagne on their father's death.2
Henry became a Cluniac monk, and was nominated in March 1140 by Henry of Blois to be Bishop of Salisbury, but the nomination was quashed.34 As compensation, Henry of Blois then named Henry de Sully the abbot of F&lt;U+00E9&gt;camp Abbey in Normandy.5 Later in 1140, after his grandmother's death, Henry was nominated to become Archbishop of York,6 but his election was again quashed this time by Pope Innocent II because Henry wished to hold both the abbacy of F&lt;U+00E9&gt;camp along with the archbishopric.78 Henry died at F&lt;U+00E9&gt;camp in 1189.9
