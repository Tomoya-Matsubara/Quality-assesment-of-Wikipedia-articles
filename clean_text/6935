Produced by David Barron, Simon Kinberg and Allison Shearmur for Walt Disney Pictures, the story is inspired by the fairy tale Cinderella by Charles Perrault (with some references from the Brothers Grimm's version of the story). Although not a direct remake, it borrows many elements from Walt Disney's 1950 animated musical film of the same name.1 The film stars Lily James in the title role as Ella (&quot;Cinderella&quot;) with Richard Madden as Prince Charming, Cate Blanchett as Lady Tremaine (the Wicked Stepmother), Sophie McShera as Drizella, Holliday Grainger as Anastasia and Helena Bonham Carter as The Fairy Godmother.
The film was released on March 13, 2015.2 It had its world premiere on February 13, 2015, in the out of competition section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival.34
Plot
Ella (Eloise Webb) lives with her wealthy parents in a beautiful estate in a peaceful kingdom. From a young age, she is taught by her mother (Hayley Atwell) to believe in the existence and presence of magic, allowing her to befriend the many animals on the estate, particularly the mice. Everything is perfect until her mother contracts a fatal illness and dies. On her deathbed, she makes Ella promise that she'll always have courage and show kindness to others. Years later, Ella's (Lily James) father (Ben Chaplin) reveals that an old acquaintance, Lord Tremaine, has passed away and he has chosen Tremaine's widow (Cate Blanchett), who has two daughters of her own, Drizella (Sophie McShera) and Anastasia (Holliday Grainger), as his second wife. Ella welcomes her step family warmly, despite the stepsisters' less than pleasant attitudes and her needing to protect her mouse friends from her stepmother's cat, Lucifer.
Soon after, Ella's father goes abroad on business. Sadly, he becomes ill and also dies. This new loss results in Lady Tremaine revealing her true cold, cruel and jealous nature. Desperate for money, she dismisses the servants and forces Ella to do all their work. Even worse, she gives Ella's room to the stepsisters, forces her to sleep in the attic, and won't even let her eat with the family. One morning, after Ella, not wanting to sleep in the cold attic, sleeps by the fireplace, her soot covered face leads her stepsisters to name her Cinderella, which Lady Tremaine (and even Ella herself) calls her. Crushed by their cruelty, Ella goes for a ride in the woods, where she encounters a hunting party. She meets one of the hunters (Richard Madden), who claims to be an apprentice named Kit who lives in the palace. Unknown to her, he's actually the only son of the land's dying king (Derek Jacobi). Despite never learning her name, Kit (a nickname given to him by his father) is enchanted by Ella's charm, kindness, and unique outlook on life and becomes obsessed with her. Upon learning that he has little time left, the King insists that Kit finds a bride at an upcoming ball. Despite the law saying that he must marry a princess, Kit can't get over the mystery girl and talks his father into letting every eligible maiden in the land attend.
When the ball is announced, the Tremaine family is ecstatic at the prospect of marrying into royalty. However, when Lady Tremaine refuses to buy Ella a new dress, Ella fashions one herself from an old dress of her mother's with help from the mice. The night of the ball begins, and Ella tries to join her step family on the way out, but Lady Tremaine, claiming that her mere presence will disgrace them, leads her daughters into ripping up the dress before leaving without her. Ella runs into the garden in tears and encounters an old beggar woman, who reveals herself to be her Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter). She uses her magic to turn a pumpkin into a magnificent carriage, four mice into horses, two lizards into footmen and a goose into a coachman, as well as turning Ella's dress into a gorgeous blue gown complete with glass shoes before sending her on her way with the warning that the spell only lasts until midnight.
At the ball, Ella wins the coveted first dance with Kit, whose true identity she's pleasantly surprised to learn. This irritates the Grand Duke (Stellan Skarsg&lt;U+00E5&gt;rd), who secretly promised Kit to a princess, a fact that Lady Tremaine overhears. After dancing, Ella and Kit tour the palace and grounds together, slowly falling in love, but before he can learn her name, the clock strikes 11:59, forcing her to flee, dropping one of her glass shoes at the palace stairs in the process. She manages to get away before the stroke of midnight and hides the other shoe in her room as a memento.
Soon after, the King dies, but not before giving his son permission to find his love. Once it's announced that every maiden in the kingdom is to try on the shoe, Ella goes to her room for hers, only to find Lady Tremaine waiting with it in her hand, having figured out her identity from her attitude after the ball. Lady Tremaine demands that Ella makes her head of the royal family and give her daughters proper husbands when she becomes queen and when she refuses, she smashes the shoe and locks Ella in her room. She then brings the shoe and identity of the mystery girl to the Grand Duke and talks him into rewarding her with title of countess and worthy husbands for her daughters. The Duke takes the shattered shoe to Kit, hoping to convince him to forget the mystery girl, but this makes him more determined than ever to find his true love.
The Grand Duke and the captain of the guards (Nonso Anozie) lead a garrison to try the remaining shoe on all the maidens in the land, all of whom are rejected by its magic, before arriving at the Tremaine estate. When the shoe rejects both stepsisters, they turn to leave, only to hear Ella singing thanks to the mice opening her bedroom window. The Grand Duke tries to leave anyway but is stopped by one of the men, who reveals himself to be Kit in disguise and demands that the captain investigate the sound. Once Ella is found, Lady Tremaine tries to forbid her from trying on the shoe, but is overruled by the captain. Sure enough, the shoe fits and Ella leaves with Kit after forgiving her stepmother, who later is forced to leave the kingdom with her daughters and the Grand Duke, never to return.
At the wedding, Kit and Ella are married and crowned king and queen. The Fairy Godmother narrates that they become the land's most beloved monarchs, ruling with the courage and kindness she promised her mother.

Production
History
There are numerous ancient myths and stories containing Cinderella motifs, dating as far back as an Egyptian tale from the first century BC.56 The modern version of Cinderella was created by French author Charles Perrault, whose fairy tale was first published in 1697.78 It has since been the basis of and inspiration behind innumerable operas, ballet, plays and films.9 The first film version was seven-minutes long, directed by George M&lt;U+00E9&gt;li&lt;U+00E8&gt;s in France in 1899.10 The first Hollywood adaptation was Paramount Pictures' 1914 silent film, starring Mary Pickford in the title role.11 Disney's classic animated version of Cinderella came out in 1950. It was a huge box office success,12 and in 2008 was named the ninth-greatest animated film of all time by the American Film Institute.13 Other recent films based on the Cinderella concept over the years include Ever After (1998) and A Cinderella Story (2004).14
Development
In May 2010, following the box office success of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, which was the second-highest grossing film of 2010 and earned over $1 billion at the box office worldwide,15 Walt Disney Pictures began developing a new film adaptation of Cinderella, making a deal on a live-action reimagining based on a script by Aline Brosh McKenna and produced by Simon Kinberg.16 In August 2011, Mark Romanek was brought on to direct.17 On February 29, 2012, it was announced that Chris Weitz would be brought in to revise McKenna's script.1819 In January 2013, Romanek left the project due to creative differences, as he was developing a version that was darker than Disney wanted.20 Later that month, Disney negotiated with Kenneth Branagh to take over as director.2122
Costumes
Three-time Oscar-winning costume designer Sandy Powell was in charge of the costumes for the film. Powell began working on concepts for the characters&lt;U+2019&gt; looks almost two years before principal photography began in the summer of 2013. Powell said she was aiming for the look of &quot;a nineteenth-century period film made in the 1940s or 1950s.&quot;23
For the stepmother and stepsisters Powell had a very strong thought about the look &quot;They are meant to be totally ridiculous on the outside&lt;U+2014&gt;a bit too much and overdone&lt;U+2014&gt;and ugly on the inside.&quot;24 While for the prince the silhouette was from the original animation, however they created a more fitted look and less masculine colors, some of the prince costumes were dyed to accentuate Madden&lt;U+2019&gt;s eyes.
The ball gown was inspired by the Disney movie in its color and shape, &quot;The gown had to look lovely when she dances and runs away from the ball. I wanted her to look like she was floating, like a watercolor painting.&quot; The dress was made with more than a dozen fine layers of fabric, a corset and a petticoat. Nine versions of the Cinderella gown were made, each with more than 270 yards of fabric and 10.000 crystals. It took 18 tailors and 500 hours to make each dress.
The wedding dress was another difficult project. &quot;Creating the wedding dress was a challenge. Rather than try to make something even better than the ball gown, I had to do something completely different and simple... I wanted the whole effect to be ephemeral and fine, so we went with an extreme-lined shaped bodice with a long train.&quot; says Powell. It took 16 people and 550 hours to complete the silk-organza, hand painted dress. While in the production was taking photographs of James in the gown, the actress stood too close to an electric heater and the dress caught on fire, the top layer of the dress had to be redone, because only one wedding dress was created due to time and budget.25
For the glass slipper, Powell took inspiration from a 1950s shoe she saw in a museum. Since glass does not sparkle, they decided to used crystal instead. Swarovski partnered with Disney to make the famous shoe. Powell went directly to Swarovski headquarters in Austria to meet the product developers. It took 6 digital renderings versions of the shoes until they found the right one for the film. Swarovski made eight pairs of crystal shoes for the film, though none of the actually wearable since it was made of crystal. For that, the visual effects had to digitally alter the leather shoes James wore on set into crystal. Alongside with the slipper, Swarovski provided more than 7 million crystals that were used in costumes and 100 tiaras for the ball scene.26

Critical reception
Cinderella received positive reviews from critics. Praise was aimed at the performances, particularly those of Lily James, Cate Blanchett and Helena Bonham Carter, the direction, and its faithfulness to the spirit and magic of the original Disney animated classic. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 84% approval rating, based on 140 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, &quot;Refreshingly traditional in a revisionist era, Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella proves Disney hasn't lost any of its old-fashioned magic.&quot;85 On Metacritic, the film has a score of 65 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.86 In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, audiences under the age of 18 gave the film an A, aged 18-24 an A-, aged 25-34 an A, and aged 35 and up an A+, on a scale of A+ to F.87
David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter reviewed the film at the Berlin Film Festival and praised the special effects, screenplay and Blanchett's performance and said that &quot;anyone nostalgic for childhood dreams of transformation will find something to enjoy in an uplifting movie that invests warm sentiment in universal themes of loss and resilience, experience and maturity.&quot;88 Likewise, Perer Debruge of Variety said, &quot;It&lt;U+2019&gt;s all a bit square, big on charm, but lacking the crackle of Enchanted or The Princess Bride. But though this Cinderella could never replace Disney&lt;U+2019&gt;s animated classic, it&lt;U+2019&gt;s no ugly stepsister either, but a deserving companion.&quot;89 Guy Lodge of The Guardian gave the film three stars out of five and said, &quot;While it might have been nice to see the new-model Cinderella follow Frozen{{'s}} progressive, quasi-feminist lead, the film's naff, preserved-in-amber romanticism is its very charm.&quot;90 Scott Mendelson of Forbes admired the film's visual effects, production design, and called the costume design as Oscar-worthy, but noted its lack of star power. He went on to say, &quot;Lush, colorful, with an emphasis on empathy and empowerment, Walt Disney's Cinderella is the best film yet in their 'turn our animated classics into live-action blockbuster' sub-genre [sic].&quot;91
