St Helen Witton Church, Northwich is in the centre of the town of Northwich, Cheshire, England (). It is a Grade I listed building.1 The church is now known as &quot;St Helen's, Witton&quot; or &quot;Northwich Parish Church&quot;.2 It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Chester and the deanery of Middlewich.3 Clifton-Taylor includes it in his list of 'best' English parish churches.4
History
The church was originally a chapel of ease to Great Budworth and the area was then known as Witton. The present building dates from the 14th century, with additions in the 15th, 16th and 19th centuries.5
Structure
The church is built in red sandstone with flattish roofs concealed by parapets.6 The plan consists of a tower at the west end, a six-bay nave with north and south aisles, a chancel with a polygonal east apse, a vestry to the north and a south porch.7 The tower has four stages, is crenellated and has diagonal buttresses and a west door. Above this is a four-light window, two-light bellringers' windows on the north and south faces, an empty niche on the west face, a clock with faces to all sides and paired two-light bell openings.8
Fittings and furniture
Over the nave and chancel is a continuous camber-beam and panel oak roof with diagonal cross-braces, large carved bosses at the junctions of the main beams and smaller ones at the junctions of the secondary beams.9 There are no memorials of distinction and most of the old fittings were discarded in the 19th century restorations. A 17th century altar table is still present.10 The three-manual organ was built between 1870 and 1880 by Young &amp; Son and later rebuilt by Charles A. Smethurst.11 The ring consists of eight bells cast by John Taylor &amp; Co in 1911.12 The parish registers begin in 1561 and the churchwarden's accounts date from the 17th century.13
External features
In the churchyard is an 18th century red sandstone sundial with a copper dial which is listed Grade II.14
