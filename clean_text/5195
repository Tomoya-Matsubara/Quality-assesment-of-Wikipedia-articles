Ronald &quot;Ron&quot; Swanson is a fictional character played by Nick Offerman, in the American comedy television series Parks and Recreation on NBC. Ron is parks department director in the fictional Indiana city of Pawnee and the immediate superior of protagonist Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler). Despite holding a government job, Ron is a staunch Libertarian who believes in as little government as possible and feels the parks department should not even run or maintain parks.
Ron, who has an extremely deadpan and masculine personality, actively works to make city hall less effective and despises interacting with the public. He loves meat, hunting and breakfast foods. He hates and fears his two ex-wives, both of whom are named Tammy, one of whom is played by Offerman's real-life wife, Megan Mullally. Ron claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him but actually cares a great deal about his colleagues, and has a particularly strong respect for Leslie.
Conceived by series creators Michael Schur and Greg Daniels, Ron has been one of the main characters since the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation. Offerman had some input into the character's creation, and some aspects of Ron's personality were inspired by the actor, like his affinity for woodworking. The traits of the character were partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official in Burbank, as well as political appointees of President George W. Bush.
Ron Swanson has received very positive reviews from critics, has developed a cult following and is widely considered the breakout character of the series. Schur has called Ron &quot;our cast MVP.&quot; He has been described by some critics as one of the best characters in a situation comedy in decades, with many comparing his comedic importance to the show to Cosmo Kramer, despite the two characters having extremely different personalities. His platonic relationship with Leslie has been compared to that of Mary Richards and Lou Grant in The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Offerman has received several award nominations for the role, and won the TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy, tying with Ty Burrell of Modern Family.
Background
Ron Swanson is the director of the parks and recreation department of the fictional Indiana city of Pawnee, a job he has held for six years at the time Parks and Recreation began.1 A staunch Libertarian,234 with a distinctive mustache,56 Ron is an extremely strong advocate for small government; despite working in a city hall job, he believes all government is a waste of taxpayer money.78 He explains his ideal government as, &quot;One guy who sits in a small room at a desk, and the only thing he's allowed to decide is who to nuke.&quot;9 Ron believes the park system should be privatized and run entirely by corporations for profit, as exemplified by the business model of the Chuck E. Cheese's chain of family entertainment centers.1011 He advocates for program cuts wherever possible,12 and purposely tries to hire people who are bad at their jobs so they will slow the government down.131415 Ron exerts almost no energy into his job, and lets his deputy director Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) do the vast majority of the work at the parks department.161718
 Ron particularly despises talking to members of the public,192021 and he deliberately designed his office to be uninviting to visitors, in part by placing a mounted shotgun on a swivel atop his desk pointed at the chair, so it will be pointed at anyone who wants to speak to him.22 Despite his lack of interest in the job, Ron occasionally demonstrates he is a good manager who recognizes the abilities of his co-workers.232425 He claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him,2627 and claims his best friend was a co-worker he knew for three years without ever learning his name.28 However, Ron cares more about his colleagues than he lets on and often helps them in spite of himself.293031 Despite sharing a nearly opposite view on the role of government, Ron gets along well with deputy parks and recreation director Leslie, and the two have a strong mutual respect for one another.323334 Although Leslie had considered a job offer in the neighboring town Eagleton, she stays based on advice from Ron that, no matter how many job offers she gets, Pawnee will always be her hometown.3536
Ron speaks in a very deadpan tone of voice and seldom expresses any kind of emotion.373839 He is an extremely masculine individual; in his entire childhood, he only cried once, when he was hit by a bus at age seven.404142 Ron is an outdoor enthusiast who loves hunting, fishing, camping and woodworking.434445 For years, Ron has used a park ranger station in the woods as a lodge for private hunting trips with his male colleagues at city hall.46 He describes fishing as &quot;like yoga, except I still get to kill something&quot;.47 He is particularly attracted to brunettes and what he describes as &quot;strong, self-possessed woman at the top of their fields&quot;, with professional athletes Steffi Graf and Sheryl Swoopes among his ideal women.484950 He loves breakfast foods and red meats;51 among the types of food he enjoys are bacon-wrapped shrimp,52 fried turkey legs inside a grilled hamburger,5354 and bacon-wrapped turkey legs, which are known in Pawnee as &quot;The Swanson&quot;.55 He also drinks heavily but seldom feels the affects of alcohol or gets hung over.5657 He is an extremely private person, going so far as to redact his birthday from government documents to keep others from holding parties for him.5859 Ron knows almost nothing about popular culture; he recognizes the name Julia Roberts only as the &quot;toothy gal from Mystic Pizza&quot;.6061. Ron is extremely concerned with the image people have of him and once refused to seek treatment for a hernia, as he instead chose to remain immobile at his desk all day and night.
Before the start of Parks and Recreation, Ron has two ex-wives, both of whom are named Tammy, which is also the name of Ron's mother. Ron despises and fears both of his ex-wives,62 and they are among the few individuals in the world who can break Ron's usually-unwavering stoicism.63 Nevertheless, Ron shares an extremely passionate sexual connection with his second ex-wife; he compared having sex with her to &quot;doing peyote and sneezing, slowly, for six hours&quot;,6465 and added, &quot;That woman really knows her way around a penis.&quot;66 Ron is so susceptible to Tammy's sexual temptations that he made a video-tape warning himself about her to play in case he ever got back together with her.67 Ron plays the saxophone, and secretly performs at out-of-town jazz clubs under the name Duke Silver, which he keeps secret from his colleagues in Pawnee. He wears a fedora and suit jacket while playing,68 fronts a band called the Duke Silver Trio, and has released such albums as Memories of Now, Smooth as Silver and Hi Ho, Duke. His music is especially popular with older women, who find Duke Silver extremely attractive.6970
Storyline
Season one
Ron Swanson made his first appearance in the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation, where he repeatedly denies Leslie's requests to pursue turning a construction pit into a park because he does not believe the parks department should build parks at all. He agrees to green-light the project only when city planner Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider) secretly cashes in an unspecified favor in exchange for the approval.71 In a deleted scene from the episode &quot;Canvassing&quot;, Ron tries to leave government employment for a previously-offered job at an Internet flower company. However, when he finds that business is now doing extremely poorly, Ron sadly realizes he will be in his government job for a long time.72 In the episode &quot;Boys' Club&quot;, Ron attends a disciplinary hearing with Leslie after she gets in trouble when the underage April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) is seen drinking alcohol on a video on the Pawnee website. Ron interrupts half-way through the review, defends Leslie and angrily berates the panel for aggressively questioning her. Although Ron claims he did it only due to his hatred for bureaucratic procedures, it is alluded that he really did so out of respect for Leslie.7374
Season two
 In &quot;Practice Date&quot;, when the parks department employees hold a contest to find who can learn the biggest secrets about each other, Ron discovers Tom's marriage to the attractive surgeon Wendy (Jama Williamson) is actually a green card marriage. Ron promises he will keep Tom's arrangement a secret. Later, Tom discovers Ron playing the saxophone at a bar in his Duke Silver persona. Tom agrees to keep Ron's secret as well.7576 Later in the season, when Tom's divorce with Wendy is finalized in &quot;Tom's Divorce&quot;, Ron politely asks whether Tom would mind if he asked Wendy out himself, and explains, &quot;Looking at her, I feel like she might be the perfect spooning size for me.&quot; Tom outwardly claims to be fine with it but, unbeknownst to Ron, is secretly upset because he actually harbors real romantic feelings for Wendy.7778
Ron's second ex-wife, Pawnee library director Tammy (Megan Mullally), appeared in the episode &quot;Ron and Tammy&quot;, where Tammy tricks Leslie into arranging a reunion meeting with Ron under the guise of wishing to work out her differences with him. In fact, Tammy schemed to get Ron to give her the rights to land Leslie plans to turn into a park, so Tammy can build a library branch there instead. During their meeting, Ron and Tammy start loudly arguing, but eventually have passionate sex and get back together. Unable to resist Tammy's charms, Ron asks Leslie to break up with Tammy for him. When Leslie stands up to Tammy in Ron's defense, he is moved by what he describes as the first time any woman has put his needs before her own, and it gives him the strength to finally break up with Tammy.798081
In &quot;Hunting Trip&quot;, Leslie insists that Ron take her and the other female parks department employees on one of his private hunting expeditions at the park ranger cabin. Ron begrudgingly agrees, but is frustrated to learn that Leslie is in fact an excellent hunter who overshadows his own abilities. During this trip, Ron is shot in the back of a head by a stray bullet and, although it is not fatal, he becomes hallucinatory and furious after taking multiple painkillers. He initially accuses Leslie of shooting him based on her desire to prove herself, but later learns it was Tom and that Leslie took the blame because Tom was not licensed and could have been arrested for hunting. Ron is strongly impressed that Leslie defended Tom this way.828384
In &quot;The Set Up&quot;, a new city-wide effort is implemented to make government officials more accessible to Pawnee residents, an idea which Ron condemns as &quot;my hell&quot;. As a result, he seeks to hire an assistant who will shield him from the public and allow him to continue doing nothing. After interviewing several candidates, he chooses April Ludgate, convinced her constant apathy and negative attitude will suit him perfectly.858687 Their relationship proves very harmonious until the episode &quot;94 Meetings&quot;, when April accidentally schedules nearly 100 meetings on a single day. April previously kept people who wanted to meet with Ron away by scheduling them for a meeting on March 31, a date she wrongly believed was nonexistent. When March 31 actually comes around, Ron has to enroll help from others in the park department to handle the meetings. He becomes so furious with April that she quits, but Ron later apologizes and hires her back.888990
In &quot;The Master Plan&quot;, state auditors Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe) and Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) arrive in Pawnee and announce that due to the city's crippling budget problems, they have to slash each department budget by up to 50 percent and briefly shut down the government completely. While Leslie is horrified, the anti-government Ron is delighted by the idea.919293 In the season finale, &quot;Freddy Spaghetti&quot;, Ron is assigned to a committee tasked with identifying budget cuts, a job which he enjoys thoroughly. However, when Ben and Chris reveal they are considering firing Leslie, Ron passionately defends her and insists they should fire him instead.9495 During the final scene of the episode and season, Tom spots Ron and Wendy together in city hall and realizes with horror they are now dating.9697
Season three
The third season opens with Ron seen begrudgingly returning to his city hall job after the Pawnee government has been shut down for three months.98 Ron starts to become a father figure of sorts to April and Andy (Chris Pratt) during the third season, despite his insistence that &quot;I'm not interested in caring about people.&quot;99100 When April is hospitalized with influenza in &quot;Flu Season&quot;, she starts to explain her relationship problems with Andy, but Ron insists he does not want to know about her private affairs. However, after Ron hires Andy to be her temporary replacement, the two spend the day bonding and Ron, against his better judgment, tells Andy that April is in the hospital and that he should visit her.101102103 Later in the season, in &quot;Media Blitz&quot;, Ron gets even further involved by chastising April for leading Andy on, and urges her to either forgive Andy or move on. His advice ultimately helps April decide to forgive Andy.104105
 Ron finds himself very happy in his relationship with Wendy,106107 although it creates tension between he and Tom.108109 This tension culminates in &quot;Ron &amp; Tammy: Part Two&quot;, when Tom brings Tammy to a party as his date simply to aggravate Ron. This occurs, however, the same day that Wendy and Ron break up, after she decides she must move back to Canada to care for her ailing parents. Ron and Tammy end up having a wild night of drinking and sex, in which Ron gets cornrows, he and Tammy get re-married and the two end up in jail.110111112 The parks department employees hold an intervention to try to convince Ron to leave Tammy, but their efforts are unsuccessful.113 After Tom reveals that Tammy only went to the party with him to make Ron miserable, Tammy brutally beats up Tom. This makes Ron remember how horrible Tammy is and he leaves her, thus ending their marriage for a second time, and Ron and Tom later reconcile.114115116
Shortly after Leslie successfully relaunches the Pawnee harvest festival, she struggles to find any new ideas for future parks project. She becomes so stressed that Ron, in the episode &quot;Camping&quot;, locks her in a room and refuses to let her out until she gets some sleep. She awakens the next day refreshed and full of ideas.117118 Ron attends Andy and April's wedding in &quot;Andy and April's Fancy Party&quot;, where he has the first dance with April. When Leslie grows concerned they are rushing into their marriage, Ron insists it is not her place to say what works for them, and offers the advice: &quot;Who's to say what works? You find somebody you like, and you roll the dice.&quot;119120 In &quot;Eagleton&quot;, Leslie discovers Ron's birthday, which he previously kept secret, and he fearfully suspects Leslie is planning an extravagant party for him. However, her surprise party for Ron is instead a quiet, private one more appropriate for Ron's personality: an evening alone with a steak, scotch and copies of his favorite movies.121122123
When city manager Chris Traeger tries to remove red meat from the city hall cafeteria as part of a government-wide health initiative in &quot;Soulmates&quot;, Ron intervenes by challenging Chris to a cook-off. Chris agrees to abandon his plan if Ron's regular hamburgers are deemed better than his lean meat turkey burgers. Although Ron exerts little effort compared to Chris, his burgers easily win the contest.124125 In &quot;Road Trip&quot;, Ron reluctantly agrees to be interviewed by a young girl for her school assignment, during which he explains his libertarian beliefs about small government, and illustrates the concept of taxes by eating 40 percent of her lunch. The two bond, and he ends the day by giving her a claymore landmine as a gift. Ron gets in trouble the next day when the girl's mother explains her daughter's assignment was &quot;Why Government Matters&quot;, and that Lauren simply wrote &quot;It doesn't&quot;.126127
Ron learns in the third season finale, &quot;Li'l Sebastian&quot;, that Leslie and Ben are secretly having an affair despite Chris' ban on workplace romances, and he warns them they are risking a political scandal that could cost them their jobs. Later, at the funeral of Pawnee's celebrity miniature horse Li'l Sebastian, Ron is nearly killed as a result of Leslie and Ben's affair. When their efforts to hide their relationship accidentally cause Li'l Sebastian's eternal flame to be filled with lighter fluid instead of propane, Ron creates a massive fireball when he lights it, which burns off his eyebrows and part of his mustache. The season ends as a horrified Ron learns that his first ex-wife, Tammy, has arrived to see him; the news is enough to make his second ex-wife, also named Tammy, run away in horror.128129
Development

Ron Swanson was created by Parks and Recreation creators Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, although Nick Offerman himself had some input into the character's creation.130131 The character's traits were partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official that Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur encountered in Burbank while researching for the show, who favored as little government interference as possible and admitted, &quot;I don't really believe in the mission of my job. ... I'm aware of the irony.&quot;132133 Ron is also partially inspired by political appointees of President George W. Bush who were perceived to be opposed to the branch of government they were overseeing.134 Ron's signature mustache was one of the first ideas conceived for the character.135136 Offerman said the deadpan style of humor he uses for Ron Swanson was cultivated during his youth, when he was an altar boy: &quot;I would read things with the utmost sincerity, and my cousin would be cracking up because he knew I was full of shit.&quot;137
Many aspects of Ron's character are based on those of Nick Offerman in real life, such as his woodworking abilities;138139 Offerman runs an independent carpentry business called Offerman Woodshop.140141 Offerman also plays saxophone in real life, just as Ron does, although the Parks and Recreation writers did not know this when they wrote this element of his character. Offerman's real-life training in stage combat and Kabuki dance were the partial inspiration for self-defense classes Ron offered his parks department colleagues in &quot;Park Safety&quot;.142 Ron's second ex-wife Tammy, who first appeared in the episode &quot;Ron and Tammy&quot;, was played by comedienne and actress Megan Mullally, Offerman's real-life wife.143144145 The idea of Ron hating his ex-wife Tammy was established early in the creation of the character, and it was Schur who conceived the idea of casting Mullally, which Offerman was extremely responsive to the idea.146
Ron became more heavily involved in Parks and Recreation storylines during the second season, and Offerman largely credited Schur with the development of the character.147 Schur has described Offerman as a &quot;once-in-a-generation comedic performer&quot;,148 and &quot;our cast MVP, and in many ways our cast leader&quot;.149 He compared Ron to a &quot;19th-century rugged individualist&quot;, and said of creating the character, &quot;A lot of the credit has to go to Nick Offerman. In real life, he's an incredibly interesting guy, and at the very least, it's much easier to play an interesting guy when you're an interesting guy.&quot;150 Offerman said his own sense of humor fuels much of the character, along with those of Schur, Greg Daniels and the writing staff; he added: &quot;I never dreamed that I could prosper with my perverse sense of humor on a network show.&quot;151 Schur said the writers like writing for Ron because &quot;he's a great mix of a superhero, and also a deeply flawed, and very human and vulnerable person&quot;.152153
Reception
Reviews

Ron Swanson has received very positive reviews from critics; he has developed a cult following and is widely considered the show's breakout character.154155156157 Joel Keller of TV Squad called Ron &quot;one of the more inspired sitcom characters of the last decade&quot;,158 and Zap2it writer Joel Keller called him one of the best sitcom characters since Kramer of Seinfeld.159 Gabriel Perna of International Business Times wrote, &quot;Offerman's Ron Swanson is one of the main reasons to watch, Parks and Recreation. Considering how funny the show is and the scope of its cast; that says a lot.&quot;160 Likewise, Gail Pennington, television critic with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, called Nick Offerman &quot;the funniest guy on TV&quot;,161 and, TV Fanatic writer Eric Hochberger said, &quot;There's certain character I watch this show for: Ron Swanson.&quot;162 Jonah Weiner of Slate.com said Ron &quot;has regularly stolen his scenes&quot; and that Offerman has &quot;a gift for understated physical comedy&quot;,163 and Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said Offerman was not only funny, but capable of expressing a surprising range of emotions.164
During the second season, HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall called Ron &quot;easily the show's best creation so far&quot;,165 and during the third season he wrote, &quot;Ron being both awesome and hilarious is something Nick Offerman and these writers can do in their sleep by now&quot;.166 Sal Basile of UGO Networks wrote, &quot;How anyone can make Ron Swanson of Parks and Recreation likable is beyond us, but Offerman does it effortlessly. Before we knew it we couldn't wait to see Swanson's reactions to the slightest of problems.&quot;167 Matt Fowler of IGN was critical of Ron at the start of the show, and called him &quot;a bit of the dud (who) offers little to the show, and almost just stand to sour the whole thing.&quot;168 However, by the second season, Fowler said the character had improved and became &quot;an absolute stand-out in the series&quot;.169 Several reviewers have praised the platonic relationship between Ron and Leslie, which has been compared to that of Mary Richards and Lou Grant in The Mary Tyler Moore Show.170171
The second season episode &quot;Ron and Tammy&quot;, which predominantly featured Ron and his second ex-wife, is widely considered one of the best Parks and Recreation episodes.172173 Offerman was particularly praised for his subtle minimalism and facial expressions, particularly the use of his eyebrows.174175176177 Based on a line from &quot;The Stakeout&quot;, when Ron says, &quot;I was born ready. I'm Ron f*****g Swanson&quot;, he is often referred by reviewers and fans as &quot;Ron Fucking Swanson&quot;.178179180181 The term &quot;Ron Swanson&quot; and the misspelling &quot;Rob Swanson&quot; were so commonly discussed on the social-networking website Twitter after &quot;Andy and April's Fancy Party&quot; aired that they were listed among the site's trending topics, which are indicative of being the most popular topics being discussed on Twitter at a given moment.182 Fans created websites based on him like &quot;Cats That Look Like Ron Swanson&quot;,183 and after Ron misunderstood a turkey burger to be &quot;a fried turkey leg inside a grilled hamburger&quot;, the cooking website Eater.com created and posted a recipe for that exact food.184185 An image of a fake flavor of Ron Swanson-themed Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream, called &quot;All of the Bacon &amp; Eggs You Have&quot;, was designed and circulated on the Internet.186187 The Ben &amp; Jerry's corporation responded positively to the image, and said in a statement, &quot;Ron's beliefs are in accordance with those of Ben &amp; Jerry's – where two scoops of government can help the less fortunate and truly be a servant to the community and its citizens.&quot;188
Awards
In 2010, Nick Offerman received a Television Critics Association Award nomination for Individual Achievement in Comedy for his performance as Ron Swanson,189190 although the award was ultimately given to Jane Lynch for her performance in the musical comedy-drama Glee.191 Also that year, Nick Offerman received a nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy from Entertainment Weekly's Ewwy Awards.192
Despite critical success, Offerman has never received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for this role. Several reviewers expressed particular surprise that he did not receive a nomination for the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards in 2011, which many considered the biggest snub of the season.193194195196 Amy Poehler in particular was outraged by Offerman's snub, and said it was &quot;a hot load of bullshit that [Offerman] didn't get nominated.&quot;197 Multiple other actors, including Michelle Forbes and Ty Burrell (the latter of which received a nomination in the category Offerman was competing in) stated that they believed Offerman should have been nominated, and Burrell added that Offerman deserved the nomination more than he.198199
