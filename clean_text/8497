Ahmad Ibrahim al-Sayyid al-Naggar was a member of Egyptian Islamic Jihad. The Jewish lobby group ADL dubbed him the &quot;propaganda chief&quot; of the militant organisation.1 He was one of 14 people subjected to extraordinary rendition by the CIA prior to the 2001 declaration of a War on Terror.2
Life
His permanent address was on al-Shaikh al-Husari street in Giza.3
In 1994, he was asked to travel to Sudan, and was subsequently introduced to Ayman al-Zawahiri, who asked him to oversee civil organisation of al-Jihad.4
In October of the following year, Zawahiri asked him to instead travel to Yemen to oversee civil operations there; but three months later was told to travel with his fake passport in the name of Ahmed Rajab Mohammed, to take a job as a teacher with the Haramain charity in Tirana, Albania.5 He also led the Centre for Islamic Heritage.6
Capture, trials, execution

He was sentenced in death in absentia in an Egyptian military court on October 15, 1997 for the crime of membership in al-Jihad, and possession of weapons.789 He was ostensibly linked to the 1995 plot to blow up the Khan el-Khalili market, as well as the the assassination of Speaker of Parliament Rifaat el-Mahgoub in October 1990.101112 The trial was condemned as &quot;unfair&quot; by Amnesty International.13
In 1998, Bary asked al-Naggar to claim asylum in the United Kingdom, so he could help convince Hani Sibai to support the Algerian GIA in media communiques.14
He was arrested on July 2, 1998 as he stepped off the plane in Cairo, having been deported from Albania with the help of the CIA.15 His wife was also arrested, and interrogated for three days during which time she was subjected to electrical torture.
He was tried in the 1999 Returnees from Albania trial at which he was defended by Montasser el-Zayat. He was tortured for nine months; locked in a room with water up to his knees 24 hours a day. When taken to SSI headquarters in Lazughli Square and questioned by Captain Yasir Azzulddin,16 his hands and feet were tied, as interrogators applied electric shocks to his nipples and penis.1718
Under torture, al-Naggar admitted that al-Jihad had acquired anthrax from an unnamed East Asian country for $3,695.19 He also admitted that EIJ raised money by raising sheep, and &quot;renovating old houses&quot; in London, England.20 He later claimed his confessions were only a result of this torture. He was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment.21 In November, he was transferred to Tora prison, where Amnesty noted he was at less risk of torture or sudden execution.22
Together with the other three Returnees brought from Tirana, his capture and torture were listed as the main reasons for the 1998 United States embassy bombings.23
He was hanged on February 23, 2000 at al-Isti&lt;U+2019&gt;naf prison, due to the earlier death sentence levied against him.2425
