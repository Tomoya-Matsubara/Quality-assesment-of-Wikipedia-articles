Boletus edulis is the Latin name for a highly regarded edible mushroom. It has a number of English names, including cep (from its Catalan name cep or its French name c&lt;U+00E8&gt;pe), king bolete and penny bun. A common term in current use is porcini (from the plural of its Italian name porcino).
 The scientific name, Boletus, from the Latin stem bolet-, meaning &quot;superior mushroom&quot; and edulis, meaning edible, explains the species' culinary qualities. This mushroom has a distinct aroma reminiscent of fermented dough. It has a higher water content than other edible mushrooms.
Other names
The mushroom is known as Ontto txuri or &quot;the blond&quot; in Basque, h&lt;U+0159&gt;ib prav&lt;U+00FD&gt; (Czech), cep (Catalan) varg&lt;U+00E1&gt;nya (Hungarian), borowik szlachetny (Polish), baravykas (Lithuanian), belyj grib &quot;white mushroom&quot; or borovik (Russian), dub&lt;U+00E1&gt;k or hr&lt;U+00ED&gt;b smrekov&lt;U+00FD&gt; (Slovakian), jur&lt;U+010D&gt;ek or jesenski goban (Slovenian), hrib or m&lt;U+00E2&gt;n&lt;U+0103&gt;tarc&lt;U+0103&gt; (Romanian), manatarka (Bulgarian), herkkutatti or &quot;delicious bolete&quot; (Finnish), harilik kivipuravik or &quot;common bolete&quot; (Estonian), Karljohan after King Charles XIV John) or stensopp (Swedish), steinsopp (Norwegian), Karl Johan or spiselig r&lt;U+00F8&gt;rhat (Danish), eekhoorntjesbrood (Dutch), vrganj (Serbian) and Steinpilz (German). It is also known as khubz el a'a or &quot;crow's bread&quot; in Arabic (Syria and Lebanon).
Description

The cap of this mushroom is 7&lt;U+2013&gt;30 cm broad at maturity, and mostly reddish-brown fading to white in areas near the margin; the color continues to darken as it matures. The stalk is 8&lt;U+2013&gt;25 cm in height, and up to 7  cm thick&lt;U+2014&gt;rather large in comparison to the cap. The pores, which do not stain when bruised, are white in youth, fading to yellow and then to brown with age. Fully mature specimens can weigh about 2 pounds (1 kg). However, the most appreciated by gourmands are the young small porcini, as the large ones often harbor maggots (insect larvae), and they become slimy and less tasty with age.
Distribution and habitat
 Boletus edulis can be found most commonly in Europe and western North America. The mushroom can grow singly or in clusters. Its habitat consists of areas dominated by oak, pine, spruce, and fir trees. Not limited to these locations, the King Bolete is also found in hardwood forests containing oaks. It fruits from summer to autumn, following sustained rainfall. This mushroom can be found during the Fall in Syria and Lebanon where it grows in large clusters on decaying oak tree stumps.
It is well known to grow in the Borgotaro area of Parma, Italy, and has PGI status there.
Boletus edulis has been reported from the vicinity of Christchurch in New Zealand, where it is likely to have been somehow introduced1.
Culinary uses
 As the name implies, Boletus edulis is edible, and most people consider it superior in flavor and in texture. It is described as nutty and slightly meaty, with a smooth, creamy texture. Porcini are eaten and enjoyed raw, saut&lt;U+00E9&gt;ed with butter, ground into pasta, in risotto, in soups, and in many other dishes.
They are widely exported and sold in dried form, reaching countries where they do not occur naturally, such as Australia.
Boletus edulis, along with Boletus badius and other boletes can be dried by stringing them separately on twine and hanging close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively they can be cleaned, but DO NOT wash, and then place in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Once dry keep in an airtight jar. Drying them in the oven is inadvisable as it can result in them being cooked and spoiling. Considering that in the UK, boletes cost GB&lt;U+00A3&gt;2.50 for 25 grams dried, it is important to preserve them without damage.
Related species
There are many fungi belonging to the genus, some edible, and some poisonous. In France, in addition to Boletus edulis (or c&lt;U+00E8&gt;pe de Bordeaux), the most popular are

T&lt;U+00EA&gt;te de n&lt;U+00E8&gt;gre (negro&lt;U+2019&gt;s head; Boletus aereus), much rarer than the Boletus edulis, is by far the most appreciated by gourmets, as well as the most expensive. Usually smaller than the Boletus edulis, it is also distinctively darker in colour.
C&lt;U+00E8&gt;pe des pins (pine tree cep; Boletus pinophilus or Boletus pinicola) grows among pine trees. Its pores are characteristically bright yellow. It is less appreciated by gourmets than the two other kinds of porcini, but remains a mushroom ranking above most others.
C&lt;U+00E8&gt;pe d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;t&lt;U+00E9&gt; (summer cep; Boletus aestivalis)

In parts of Colorado and New Mexico (and possibly elsewhere) there is a species Boletus barrowsii, named after its discoverer Chuck Barrows. 1 It is mycorrhizal with Ponderosa pine and hence tends to grow in areas where there is less rainfall. Some find it as good as if not better than Boletus edulis.
