Jani Lax (born October 26, 1977) is a Swedish mixed martial artist, who competes in the Lightweight division. He has fought around the world in a number of promotions including Finnfight, M-1 Global and Shooto.
Background
Lax began his mixed martial arts career in 1999 with Finnfight, one of the largest promotions in the Nordic countries and known for its brutal no-holds-barred rules. He lost his debut against Marcus Peltonen by knockout in the first round, but went on to defeat Joachim Hansen in his next bout.
After Finnfight, he fought in M-1 Global in Russia, where he had one win and one loss. He then went to Japan to fight with Shooto, where his promotional debut came against Akira Kikuchi. Kikuchi was able to submit him in the first round. After this loss, he had a four-fight winning streak spanning across Europe and Japan. It was halted, however, when he came up against Tatsuya Kawajiri in April 2005. He also lost his next two bouts, against Hiroyuki Takaya and Alexandre Izidro.
In May 2010, he returned to the ring for the first time in almost three years and submitted Danny van Bergen at an M-1 Global event in Helsinki. His next bout will in the British Association of Mixed Martial Arts against Rob Sinclair for the BAMMA Lightweight Championship at BAMMA 4: Reid vs. Watson on September 25, 2010.1
