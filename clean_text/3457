}} | genre = Role-playing | platforms = Nintendo DS | media = }}

are role-playing games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. They are the first installments in the fifth generation of the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon series of role-playing games.1 First released in Japan on September 18, 2010, they were later released in Europe on March 4, 2011, in North America on March 6, 2011, and Australia on March 10, 2011.
Similar to previous installments of the series, the two games follow the journey of a young Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon trainer through the region of Unova, as they train Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon used to compete against other trainers, while thwarting the schemes of the criminal organization Team Plasma. Black and White introduced 156 new Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon to the franchise, 5 more than the previous record holder Red and Blue, as well as many new features, including a seasonal cycle, rotation battles, fully animated Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon sprites and triple battles. Both titles are independent of each other, but feature largely the same plot, and while both can be played separately, trading Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon between both of the games is necessary in order to complete the games' Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;dex.
Upon their release, Black and White received positive reviews; critics praised the advancements in gameplay, as well as several of the new Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon introduced. Reviewers, however, were divided on some of the character designs, and some critics felt that the games did not innovate as much as expected. Nevertheless, the games were commercial successes; prior to the games' Japanese release, Black and White sold one million consumer pre-orders and sold five million copies as of January 2011, making it one of the best selling DS games to date. As of March 2013, the games' combined sales have reached 15.42 million, putting the titles amongst the best selling games for the Nintendo DS, but still being outsold by their predecessors, Diamond and Pearl.2 Sequels to Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black and White, named Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black 2 and White 2, were released in Japan for the Nintendo DS in June 2012, with October releases in North America, Europe, and Australia.
Gameplay

Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black and White are role-playing video games with adventure elements, presented in a third-person, overhead perspective.3 There are three basic screens: an overworld, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures their party, items, or gameplay settings. The player controls a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Trainer who begins the game with a single Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon4 and is able to capture more using Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt; Balls.5 Like all other Trainers, the player can carry up to six Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon at one time. However, the game also includes a network of PCs to store hundreds of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon. PCs are found in certain buildings&lt;U+2014&gt;namely, &quot;Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Centers&quot;, where the player heals their Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon with low health.6
Most Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon evolve into other forms when certain conditions are met, such as when they reach a certain level&lt;U+2014&gt;levels range from 1 to 100&lt;U+2014&gt;or have a certain item used on them.7 They can learn up to four moves, including attacking moves, healing moves, and moves that inflict status conditions on the opponent.8 They have six stats that affect battle performance: maximum HP (hit points), Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Attack and Special Attack are distinguished from Defense and Special Defense by the types of moves being considered: generally, moves involving physical exertion are physical, while moves involving supernatural or elemental powers are special. Moves are classed as one of seventeen types, such as Normal, Water, Electric, Ghost, Bug, and Rock; Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon can have one or two types. Generally, most of a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon's moves correspond to its typing. A Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon's type makes it vulnerable or resistant to others; for example, Fire-type Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon are weak to Water-type moves, while Grass-type moves do little damage to them and Electric-type moves do normal damage.9
When the player encounters a wild Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon or is challenged by another Trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon fight. During battle, the player may fight, use an item, switch the active Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, or flee. However, the player cannot flee a battle against another Trainer or against certain wild Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon that are stronger than the player's. When a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints until it is revived.10 If an opposing Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon faints, all of the player's Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon who participated in defeating it receive experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon may level up, increasing its stats.11 Many Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon evolve into other forms, usually by reaching certain levels.12 At the &quot;Day Care&quot; location, the player can breed two of their Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon&lt;U+2014&gt;usually, a male and a female&lt;U+2014&gt;to create Eggs that hatch into baby Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon at level 1.13
The world of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black and White, known as Unova, consists of a number of cities and towns connected by &quot;Routes&quot;.14 Random encounters may take place in tall grass along routes or in bodies of water. The player occasionally battles Trainers in cities and towns, as well as along routes.15 In addition, eight of the game's cities and towns are homes to &quot;Gym Leaders&quot;, powerful Trainers specializing in certain types of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon; beating a Gym Leader gives the player a &quot;Badge&quot;. All eight Badges are needed to unlock the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon League,16 where the player faces off against the &quot;Elite Four&quot; and, finally, the Champion. Across Unova, items can be found on the ground or purchased from &quot;Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt; Marts&quot;.17 For example, Hyper Potions restore HP,18 Antidotes cure poisoning,19 and Revives revitalize fainted Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon.20 TMs (Technical Machines) teach moves to Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, and HMs (Hidden Machines) are a special class of TMs for important moves that allow the player to traverse the environment. The &quot;Surf&quot; HM move, as one example, is used to cross bodies of water.21
New features
The graphics have been improved from Diamond and Pearl. The dialog boxes of previous games have been changed to speech balloons that appear over other characters' heads, allowing more than one character to speak at once. Japanese players can have kanji appear on screen, rather than only hiragana and katakana.22 During battles, the sprites of the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon are fully animated and the camera changes position to highlight specific parts of the battle.23 In addition to continuing the day and night cycle introduced in Gold and Silver, Black and White introduces a seasonal cycle, with the seasons advancing every month rather than being linked to the calendar. Outside areas appear differently depending on the season, such as changing of leaves in autumn or snow on the ground in winter. Certain areas are only accessible during certain seasons, and different Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon can be found in the wild in winter where others are encountered in the other seasons.24 The Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Deerling and Sawsbuck change their physical appearance to match the seasons.2526
There are two new battle mechanics: Triple Battles27 and Rotation Battles.28 In Triple Battles, both teams must send out three Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon in a row at once; Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon on the left or right side can only attack the opponent's Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon on the same side or in the center. Changing position takes up one turn. In Rotation Battles, each side sends out three Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon at once, but they are arranged in a circle that can be rotated at will. Black has more Rotation Battles than Triple Battles, and the opposite is true in White. Another introduction is Combination Moves: a starter Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon can be taught one of three moves, and using them together in Double or Triple battles produces more powerful attacks. In the wild, walking through different-colored tall grass can trigger Double Battles against wild Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon rather than only Single Battles as usual.29
Occasionally, the player can find rustling patches of grass and rippling water, where they can encounter either a rare Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon more common in the opposite game version, or the highest evolutionary form of a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon whose lower forms can normally be found in the area. This is the only way to capture Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon such as Audino, Emolga, and Alomomola. Also, dust clouds in caves and the shadows of flying Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon on certain bridges can be entered to either find a rare item or encounter Drilbur, Excadrill, Ducklett, or Swanna, none of which can be found in the wild otherwise. Occasionally, when throwing a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt; Ball, the capture rate is highly increased, triggered by a random event.30 There are also new side-games and sidequests: the player can compete in Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Musicals,31 a side-game similar to the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Contests of previous games; the Battle Subway,32 similar to the Battle Towers and Battle Frontiers of previous games; and on the Royal Unova, a cruise ship that the player can ride and fight Trainers aboard to win otherwise rare items.33
Connectivity to other devices

The bottom screen of the Nintendo DS console holds the C-Gear, a game feature that controls how players connect with each other via IR, Wi-Fi or Wireless connections. The top screen displays the games' overworld, utilizing a new 3D engine to render New York City-inspired cityscapes.

The  replaces the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;tech from Diamond and Pearl on the Nintendo DS's bottom screen. It controls the game's wireless capabilities, including infrared (IR) communication for battling and trading, wireless communications in the Xtranceiver video chat34 access to the Entralink to transfer content from the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Dream World, using the Wi-Fi to sync with the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Global Link servers, and the new &quot;Pass By mode&quot; which allows the game to communicate with other copies through infrared while the DS is asleep.35 The  function tests the compatibility between two players and awards them items accordingly.36 In the &quot;Pass By&quot; feature, the player answers various survey questions and receives one of several items depending on how many other players they have connected with. In the &quot;Random Matchup&quot; feature, the player can battle others randomly.37 When playing against others online or in IR battles, a new mechanic called the Wonder Launcher allows healing items to be used in battle.38
Two features were added to transfer Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon from older DS Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon games to Black and White. For normal transfer, the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt; Transfer feature is available after completion of the main storyline. Unlike the &quot;Pal Park&quot; feature from previous games, the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt; Transfer is a mini-game in which after six Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon are transferred, the player uses the touch screen to launch Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt; Balls at the transferred Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon to catch them within a time limit.39 Another feature called the Relocator is used to transfer the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon given away in promotions for the film Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon: Zoroark: Master of Illusions so the player can obtain the rare Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Zorua and Zoroark. Unlike the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt; Transfer, this is available before the main game is completed.40
Unique to Black and White is the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Dream World,41 a which is dependent on the official Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Global Link website. Here, the player can befriend Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon that are not normally obtainable in-game and that have unique abilities. This occurs after syncing the game back with the Dream World, similarly to the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;walker from HeartGold and SoulSilver. The player can maintain a house in the Dream World that other players can visit as well as grow berries. In addition to allowing access to Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon acquired in the Dream World, the Entralink also enables players to interact with each other and play side-games. These side-games award points that can be traded for temporary powers such as increasing experience, improving capture rate, or lowering prices of items in Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt; Marts.42 
Plot
Setting
 Black and White are set in the Unova region, a continental mass located far away from the previous regions, Kanto, Johto, Hoenn and Sinnoh.43 Unlike the previous regions which were based on real locations in Japan, Unova is modeled after New York City,4445 an idea developed by game director Junichi Masuda when he visited the city for the launch of Diamond and Pearl.46 One particular example of this is Castelia City, which serves as the region's central metropolis and had such inspirations as its &quot;Brooklyn Bridge-style suspension bridge&quot; and its &quot;huge skyscrapers&quot;. Masuda also wanted to convey a &quot;feeling of communities&quot; in Castelia's streets.47 Unova is host to large urban areas, a harbor, an airport, an amusement park, several bridges, and several mountain ranges. In addition to a diversity of new landscapes, the Unova region is also home to a diversity of people who vary in skin tone and occupation. The region's Japanese name  is derived from the Japanese words  and ; the many kinds of people and Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon seen up close look like only one kind of life from afar.48
Story
Like previous Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon games, Black and White both follow a linear storyline; the main events occur in a fixed order. The protagonist of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black and White is a teenager who sets out on a journey through Unova to become the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon master. At the beginning of the games, the player chooses either Snivy, Tepig, or Oshawott as their starter Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon as a gift from Professor Juniper. The protagonist's friends, Cheren and Bianca, are also rival Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Trainers who occasionally battle the player, Cheren will chose the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon with a type advantage against yours, while Bianca will chose the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon with a type disadvantage. The player's primary goal is to obtain the eight Gym Badges of Unova and ultimately challenge the Elite Four of the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon League, and its Champion, to win the game.  In addition to the standard gameplay, the player will also have to defeat the games' main antagonist force, Team Plasma, a Knights Templar-esque group who claims that Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon are oppressed by mankind and seeks for a means to liberate them.49 Team Plasma is led by &quot;N&quot;, a young man who was brought up alongside Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon and sees them as friends rather than tools for sport.50 Throughout the game, the player has some encounters with N, who claims that by capturing one of the legendary Dragon Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon of Unova and defeating the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Champion Alder, he will be recognized as Unova's hero and will be able to convince the humans to part with their Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon. Depending on the game version, N will capture the Deep Black Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Zekrom in Black51 or the Vast White Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Reshiram in White.52
After the player defeats the Elite Four and enters the Champion's chamber, he or she finds that N has defeated Alder and has become the newest Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Champion. Soon after, he summons a large castle that surrounds the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon League, challenging the player to find him to take part in one final battle. When the player finally reaches him, Reshiram in Black or Zekrom in White appears before the player, and the player must capture the legendary Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon before challenging N. After his defeat, N laments the possibility that his ideals are mistaken, as Ghetsis intrudes and angrily reveals that his true intentions were to use N to ensure that he would be the only human left with control over Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon and use them to rule the world. In his rage, Ghetsis challenges the player to battle. After Ghetsis's defeat, he is arrested, allowing Alder to resume his position as the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Champion of the Unova region. N then thanks the player for helping realize his mistake about the nature of the relationship between people and their Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon before leaving the castle on his captured Dragon Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon to a far-off land.53
After Team Plasma's defeat, Looker arrives in Unova and tasks the player with finding the remaining Sages of Team Plasma, so they can be brought to justice. The player can also challenge the Elite Four once again, and challenge Alder, ultimately becoming the Unova region's new Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Champion. The player also gains access to the eastern portion of Unova, which contains Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon from the previous games in the series, as well as access to an area unique to each game version: the ultra-metropolitan Black City, home to powerful Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon trainers; and the White Forest, home to humans and Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon living in harmony. Cynthia, a former Champion of the Sinnoh region, is also found in this area of the game and can be challenged. A non-player character named after Shigeki Morimoto, a Game Freak programmer, creature designer, and the director of the HeartGold and SoulSilver games, can also be found and battled in the game.
Development
 On January 29, 2010, the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Company announced that a new game was in development for the Nintendo DS to be released later that year.5455 Director Junichi Masuda stated that several aspects of the series were being revamped for the new generation.56 On April 9, 2010, the Japanese website updated with the titles of the versions as Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black and White, and announced a Q3 2010 release date.57 The games feature an improved visual style from other Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon games, with an increased use of 3D computer graphics than any other of the handheld series. It also has a special feature that allows the user to upload their saved game to the Internet, allowing them to do certain things on an official website.5859
On August 3, 2010, Masuda announced on his blog that the Black and White game versions will initially only contain brand-new Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon to evoke a feeling of it being a brand-new game, like when the original Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon games were first released.60 In all of the games following the first generation, there were a series of new Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon introduced interspersed with Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon from the previous generations. For example, Pikachu was introduced in Red and Green, and was obtainable in Blue, Yellow, and all subsequent main series games; however, Pikachu will not be obtainable in Black and White from the start of the game. It was later confirmed that Black and White are region locked on the Nintendo DSi.61
Game director Junichi Masuda stated that to keep the games fresh, he looks at every previous element to decide what to adapt to the new game, stating &quot;people may not like what they like in the past, trend wise&quot;. He explained the new battle styles, stating that while triple battles take more strategy, rotation battles take more luck to win.62 Masuda stated that their goal when making the games was to make it fun for new players, but they also wanted to get players who have not played the series in a while to come back. He said that it was hard to find that balance to satisfy both kinds of players. For the new players, there is good explanation in how to play, while for old players, they incorporated the C-Gear, which makes the ability to trade and battle easier. When asked about the decision to introduce over 150 new species of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, Masuda stated that they did this so old players would not be able to know what is a good Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon to use, and it would level the playing ground for new players.63
Promotion and release
Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black and White were released in Japan on September 18, 2010,64 in Europe on March 4, 2011, and in North America on March 6, 2011. The Australian release was on March 10, 2011.6566
Japanese release
A silhouette of a new Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon was shown by Junichi Masuda on the February 7, 2010 episode of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Sunday, stated to be in the film for the summer and to be identified in a future episode on February 21.67 This new character would also be featured in the March 2010 issue of CoroCoro Comic available on February 15, and is the start of the fifth generation of the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon franchise. Since then, the character has been named &quot;Zoroark&quot;, and it evolves from a character named &quot;Zorua&quot;. Both were featured in the film Pocket Monsters Diamond &amp; Pearl The Movie: Phantom Ruler: Zoroark.6869 For pre-order ticket holders, an alternate-colored Raikou, Entei, or Suicune was available for transfer to their Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, or SoulSilver games. At the theater, players would be able to download a Celebi to the same games.70 Both of these Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon would activate special events in Black and White involving Zoroark and Zorua, respectively.7172
On April 18, 2010, the episode of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Sunday showed game footage of a player character walking around in a 3D environment and a single screenshot depicting a battle between the player's Zoroark and an enemy Zorua. Host Shoko Nakagawa made note of how the player's Zoroark's sprite was a full body sprite as viewed from behind, when in the past all such sprites only showed a smaller portion of the player's Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon's body.73 On May 9, 2010, the episode of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Sunday revealed silhouettes of the three Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon available to choose from at the beginning of the games,74 which were later revealed to be the Grass Snake Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Tsutarja, the Fire Pig Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Pokabu, and the Sea Otter Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Mijumaru.75 Other information revealed is that the game takes place in the Isshu Region which includes the Hiun City metropolis.76 On May 16, 2010, the episode of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Sunday showed game battle footage, illustrating the new in-battle animations and dynamic camera positioning; also described were Zoroark's Illusion ability and the special Zoroark acquired by the movie ticket pre-order gift Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon.77
On May 28, 2010, both the official Japanese and English Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon websites revealed names and designs of the two major Legendary Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon of these games, who also serve as the game version mascots: the White Yang Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Reshiram for Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black and the Black Yin Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Zekrom for Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon White.78 The July 2010 issue of CoroCoro Comic revealed the C-Gear wireless interactivity features,79 the ability to upload game data to the internet and the player's computer,80 several brand-new Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, new Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon moves, Reshiram and Zekrom's Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon types, details on the Celebi/Zorua event, and a new character: Professor Araragi, the first female Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon professor to appear in the video games.81 The June 27, 2010, episode of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Sunday, made the announcement of the release date as September 18, 2010, and a yet-to-be named character.82 The June 28 episode of Oha Suta, showed a trailer, which included its release date, new gameplay footage, several new characters, more new Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, and a three-on-three battle system.83 The August 2010 issue of CoroCoro Comic elaborated upon many new game mechanics: the three-on-three system, the online Global Link system, an online Dream World that can allow for access to other Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, access to an area that uses the Wi-Fi called the Hilink (similar to the Underground), a special feature called the Live Caster for video chat on the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo 3DS, kanji support, aesthetic differences between the two versions of the game, areas exclusive to the game versions, new characters, new moves, new abilities, and new Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon.84
The July 25, 2010, episode of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Sunday introduced the new phantom Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Victini,85 which initially appeared in a trailer for the 2011 Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon film that was shown with screenings of Phantom Ruler: Zoroark. It is noted to be Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon No. 000 in Isshu's regional Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;dex, and is only accessible by downloading a special item from Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, DS Stations, and Nintendo Zones (such as those found in Japanese McDonald's restaurants) to a game save. This was initially available for a month following the games' release date.86 Another promotional Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon given out after the games' release is a Kumasyun, a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon that is difficult to find in the games unless it is during the games' winter season.87
On the day of the Japanese release, Nintendo of America sent cease and desist letters to two English language Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon fansites, Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;Beach and Serebii, after they published screenshots and various other media from the newly released games.88 Nintendo claimed the posting of the media was infringing copyright and noted their intention to shut down the websites under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act unless the media was removed.89909192 The screenshots were subsequently taken down from both websites.93 Luke Plunkett of video game blog Kotaku initially speculated that Nintendo of America issued the cease and desist letters over the belief that the images were illegally obtained via a ROM image; however, Jon Sahagian of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;Beach stated the images in question had been obtained from the Japanese forum 2channel.94 Charlie Scibetta, Nintendo of America's senior director of corporate communications, later stated that it was the choice of images that were of concern to the company. In a statement to Kotaku, he said, &quot;Nintendo supports and appreciates the efforts that Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon fans go through to create fan sites. In most cases there is no issue with the content that is posted, but on this occasion we had to contact a select few websites to ask them to take down confidential images.&quot;95
International release
The foreign promotion for the games began on November 22, 2010, when the official website for the North American, European, and Australian markets was updated, including the localized names of the starter Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon (Snivy, Tepig, and Oshawott in English, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish markets)96 and the setting (Unova Region).97 Floats of version mascots Reshiram and Zekrom accompanied the Pikachu balloon during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on November 25, 2010, the following Thursday.98
On December 27, 2010, the official websites for the international releases updated once more, revealing the English names for many of the first Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon revealed during the promotion for the Japanese release. In addition, the English names for the game location Hiun City and the character Professor Araragi were revealed to be Castelia City99 and Professor Juniper, respectively.100
Starting on January 3 and lasting until January 9, 2011, in the United States, players of Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver were able to visit GameStop stores to download the special shiny Raikou that was previously given out for Phantom Ruler: Zoroark pre-order ticket holders in Japan.

Reception
Critical response

Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black and White have received largely positive reviews by critics, having an aggregate score of 86.35% on GameRankings and 87% on Metacritic (indicating generally favorable reviews).117118 Japanese magazine Famitsu Weekly awarded the game a perfect 40/40 score, becoming the 15th game to receive such a distinction, as well as obtaining the highest score ever given to a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon video game by the publication.119 Game Informer{{'}}s Annette Gonzalez remarked that &quot;Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black and White do a great job building upon already solid features and taking them to the next level.&quot;120 VideoGamer.com's Jamin Smith criticized the games for not innovating as much as some people would have liked, but stated that &quot;rest assured in the knowledge that Black and White are damn fine games; the best the series has to offer.&quot;121 Official Nintendo Magazine referred to them as &quot;A beautiful refinement of a great series [...] the best Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon ever.&quot;122 Nintendo Power expressed that &quot;the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon series's latest pair of adventures is as addictive as ever. &quot;123 Edge acknowledged that &quot;where next for Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black and White don't suggest any answers, but they do remind us why we'd care in the first place.&quot;124
IGN gave the games a 9/10, a higher rating than any of the other Nintendo DS Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon games. The review praised the games for renewing interest in the series, though criticized some of the new Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon designs, explaining that &quot;aside from a weaker lineup of monsters (largely an aesthetic complaint), this is the best Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon has to offer on every level, renewing my waning interest in monster battling&quot;.125 Jeremy Parish of Retronauts criticized Black and White, commenting that he grew tired of it shortly after starting and feeling like it was too similar to all previous Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon games. He further went on to say that EVs and IVs, invisible mechanics in the game, are not necessarily beneficial. By contrast, he noted that it would be great to new players. He also compared it to the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Mystery Dungeon games and Final Fantasy XIII, arguing that they all share the common element of being bad before they get good. Fellow Retronauts contributor Justin Haywald criticized the games' release on the DS, which had received two main Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon series games published before them.126 GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson stated &quot;It may not break the Pokemon mold, but Black/White offers enough new content coupled with the series' classic, deep battle mechanics to make it endlessly playable. If you could only play one game for the rest of your life, this would be a wise choice.&quot;127
Commercial performance
In August 2010, one month before the games' release in Japan, Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black and White gained a total of 1.08 million pre-orders, becoming the fastest game on the Nintendo DS to break the one million mark.128 In the first two days on sale, it sold more than 2.6 million copies,129 becoming the biggest launch in the series history in Japan.130 By November 3, the games had sold over 4.3 million copies in Japan.131 As of January 9, 2011, the games became the fastest DS titles to sell five million copies.132

In the US, Black and White sold more than 1.08 million copies on day one, breaking the previous day-one record held by predecessors Diamond and Pearl of 780,000 copies.134 According to the NPD Group, Nintendo sold 1.3 million units of White and 1.1 million units of Black in March 2011, making them the #1 and #2 top selling games in the US for the month.135 In April 2011, Nintendo's financial earnings report confirmed that Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black and White had sold 11.5 million copies worldwide, making them the highest selling DS games for Nintendo in the 2010-11 financial year, and third overall, behind only the Wii games, Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort.136 As of March 2013, the games' combined sales have reached 15.42 million.137
Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black 2 and White 2



are sequels to Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black and White, released in Japan for the Nintendo DS on June 23, 2012, with early October releases in North America, Europe, and Australia.138139 They are the first direct sequels in the franchise and the final games in the main series to be released for Nintendo DS. The games were first revealed on the February 26, 2012, episode of the Japanese television program Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Smash!,140141 followed by an international confirmation on the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon official website.142 The games feature the new Legendary Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon identified by Junichi Masuda as  and .143144
Changes
Black 2 and White 2 are set two years after the events of Black and White, and much of the beginning events take place in new locations on the western side of the Unova region. These new locations also feature several Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon that were previously unavailable in Black and White, featuring a total of 300 unique creatures available from the start of the game, including Psyduck, Mareep, Growlithe, and Riolu.145
A new game mechanic introduced in Black 2 and White 2 is the  side game, where the player character participates in the filming of a movie involving Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon and other actors. A character named Brycenman ( in Japan) also appears, as Brycen (Hachiku) from the original games has returned to his movie career.146 Another new mechanic is the , where the player battles powerful trainers from the previous games in the series, ranging from Gym Leaders Brock, Misty, Volkner, and Giovanni to Champions Cynthia, Steven, and Lance.147
Black 2 and White 2 are also compatible with two new downloadable games for the Nintendo 3DS, Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Dream Radar () and Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;dex 3D Pro ().148 Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon AR Searcher introduces the character  as well as alternate forms for the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Tornadus, Thundurus, and Landorus, which can be transferred to Black 2 and White 2 after being captured in AR Searcher.149 The legendary Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Keldeo also received a new form in the game, known as the Resolution form.150
Plot
The player and their rival begin their Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon journey on the western side of Unova in the new Aspertia City, receiving their starter Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon from Bianca, an NPC that served as one of the player's rivals in the previous Black and White. The player also meets Cheren, the other rival character, who is now a Gym Leader in Aspertia City. Much like other Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon games, the player travels around the region, battling Gym Leaders to acquire eight Gym Badges, and then goes on to challenge the Elite Four of the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon League and its champion to win the game.
The plot of Black 2 and White 2 once again features the antagonistic Team Plasma, whom the player first encounters while running an errand, and later when travelling to the first other major city where the team announces its plans to take over the world and steal others' Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon in front of the player, the rival, and new Gym Leader Roxie ( in Japan).151 At the behest of Iris, the player helps Burgh track down more Team Plasma members in the sewers of Castelia City, where the player meets Colress ( in Japan) for the first time, who claims to be a researcher of the strengths of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon.152
Later, it is revealed that the new Team Plasma has stolen a Purrloin the player's rival was planning on giving to his sister, which makes the rival angry towards the organization, including its reformed former members. After learning about the legendary Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Kyurem, which arrived at the Giant Chasm years ago, the player discovers that the new Team Plasma is working to use Kyurem to take over the world, harnessing its power to freeze large portions of Unova, including Opelucid City. The player tracks Team Plasma to Humilau City, home of the final new Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Gym led by Marlon ( in Japan),153 where he helps the player battle Team Plasma to remove Kyurem from their grasps, and to help the rival retrieve his Purrloin, which has since evolved into a Liepard that is used in battle against the player and rival.
The battle reaches its climax in the Giant Chasm, where the player discovers Colress has sided with Team Plasma to learn more about the capabilities of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, and that Ghetsis is planning to use Kyurem, the &quot;empty&quot; Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon that is left over from when Zekrom and Reshiram split apart hundreds of years ago, by filling it with his ambition to rule the world. After battling the Shadow Triad with help from the player's rival (receiving his Liepard back), the player enters the inner sanctum of the Giant Chasm where they find Kyurem and Ghetsis. N appears with either his Zekrom (Black 2)/Reshiram (White 2) to try to talk sense into his father Ghetsis, but N's legendary Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon is defeated by and fused with Kyurem, transforming it into Black Kyurem (Black 2)/White Kyurem (White 2), and forcing the player to battle it. After defeating Kyurem, it separates from N's Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon and the player faces Ghetsis, who is stunned that he has been defeated again. N tries to talk sense into him, but Ghetsis leaves, and N thanks the player for his assistance in defeating Team Plasma once and for all. After defeating Team Plasma, the player is finally able to battle the Elite Four and the New Champion of the Unova League, Iris, and win the game.
After the game's main story is completed, the player is able to challenge N who has taken up residence in his former castle, where upon the defeat of his legendary Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, it turns into the object that once held its essence and N gives it to the player. The player can then bring the item to another part of Unova where it transforms back into the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon and the player can then capture it. Also, after completion of the game, the player can battle former Unova Champion Alder, Sinnoh Champion Cynthia, the former Striaton City Gym Leaders, and take on the Black Tower or White Treehollow challenges in Black City or White Forest. Through use of a unique game feature called &quot;Memory Link&quot;, the player can access new content and side quests dependent on the original Black and White games, such as references to the player's name in the previous game, flashback sequences, the ability to capture Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon that once belonged to N, battling Cheren and Bianca who reminisce about the protagonist of the previous game, and participating in the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon World Tournament.
Music
Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black 2 and White 2 background music contains the music of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black and White, adds a lot of brand new tracks, and utilizes the arrangements of most tracks from Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black and White. The official soundtrack of the game titled  was released in Japan on July 25, 2012. Its DISC 4 also includes music from Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Black and White, Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Emerald, and Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Platinum,154 which were not released on original soundtrack CD prior to this.
