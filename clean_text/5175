Plot
Dwight (Rainn Wilson), Jim (John Krasinski), Stanley (Leslie David Baker), Cathy (Lindsey Broad), Ryan (B.J. Novak) and Erin (Ellie Kemper) travel to Tallahassee as part of a team picked for Sabre's new project. On the day of orientation, Dwight wakes everyone up at 5 o'clock in order to be ready. Jim, however, being used to two babies, has been up since 4 and decorates his room to look as if he had been murdered in order to prank Dwight, going as far as to writing &quot;It was Dwight&quot; on the wall in faux-blood. Dwight and Erin then walk in the room only to find it in ruins. Moments later, Jim lurches out of the closet as if he has been murdered.
At the orientation meeting, Dwight and Jim soon discover that Todd Packer (David Koechner) is still working at the company after the two of them attempted to get him fired, which Packer has already realized. The president of Sabre's special projects, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) begins to talk about the project, which encompasses creating a store to rival Apple's chain of stores, and Dwight and Packer start to compete to see who will become her vice president. Dwight, however, develops an appendicitis and is rushed into surgery. However, three hours later, after getting his appendix removed, he returns in order to impress his new boss. After nearly butchering a slide-show presentation, he finally impresses Bertram by telling the audience that the only element of marketing that matters is &quot;desire.&quot; Bertram subsequently invites Packer and Dwight to have breakfast with her the following day. Afterwards, Wally Amos of Famous Amos cookies (as himself) attempts to make a speech to the group, but is interrupted and ultimately eclipsed by the cookies he brought for the group.
Meanwhile in Scranton, the office is left without a receptionist. Andy (Ed Helms) decides to fill in and pretends to thoroughly enjoy himself. He orders new magazines for the waiting area, cooks mini-pizzas as reception snacks, color-coordinates the desk, and brings in a mail cart to deliver mail. Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Darryl (Craig Robinson) attempt to talk him out of his newfound &quot;enjoyment,&quot; believing it to be linked to his lingering feelings for Erin, to no success.

Reviews
&quot;Tallahassee&quot; received largely positive reviews from critics, with many noting that the Florida story-line gave the series a focus. TV Equals noted that the episode was &quot;one of the best episodes of The Office this the season and [possibly] one of the better episodes from the last couple of seasons.&quot;28 Brian Marder from Hollywood.com wrote a largely positive review, noting that &quot;Overall, tonight represented a significant step back in the right direction -- and hope that maybe the series still has hope. [...] More promisingly, the humor was top-notch, funnily similar to the effortless comedy of early seasons and refreshingly dissimilar to the forced, uncharacteristic stuff that has pervaded season 8.&quot;29 Bret Davinger from the California Literary Review noted that &quot;A couple of weeks ago, I complained about The Office spending too much time away from the office. How was I to know that taking a trip to Tallahassee would produce probably the best episode of the season and maybe one of the best episodes of the past couple of seasons?&quot;30 Davinger went on to note that the change in scenery from the office set to Tallahassee was working for the series.31 In addition, he noted that episode did not feature any hints of Erin's desire to stay in Florida or Cathy's attempt to seduce Jim, a move he hoped would be permanent.32 Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave awarded the album an 8 out of 10 and wrote that &quot;between 'Special Project' and 'Tallahassee' it&lt;U+2019&gt;s fair to say that The Office is on a nice little run. Everything good and funny about last week&lt;U+2019&gt;s episode spilled over to 'Tallahassee'.&quot;33 TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode four out of five stars.34 Despite praising the episode for coming &quot;together as one of the best Office episodes of the season,&quot; he criticized Dwight's main plot, calling it &quot;not funny.&quot;35 The Filtered Lens reviewer Matt Dougherty called the episode &quot;solid&quot; and noted &quot;While 'Tallahassee' was not quite as good as last week, it still is a step in the right direction for this struggling show.&quot;36 He ultimately awarded the episode a 7 out of 10.37 Many reviews praised the episode's cold opening, with many critics calling it one of the funniest openings of the eighth season.383940 What Culture! reviewer Jeffrey Kratzer, despite awarding the episode three out of five stars, wrote, &lt;U+201C&gt;'Tallahassee' was so enjoyable (for the most part) that [the] next few episodes look to be the excitement and focused momentum we&lt;U+2019&gt;ve been waiting for all season.&quot;41
Not all reviews were positive. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt gave the episode a C- rating and criticized the episode's lack of complexity.42 He wrote that, &quot;I would argue, though, that [undeveloped characters are] part of the show&lt;U+2019&gt;s problem right now&quot; and noted that Tate's performance was expanded &quot;little [...] beyond her initial appearance last season.&quot;43 In a review for the subsequent episode, &quot;After Hours,&quot; however, McNutt acknowledged that, &quot;If I&lt;U+2019&gt;m being honest with [sic], last week&lt;U+2019&gt;s probably should have been above a 'C-,' but I went with my gut and have to stand by that decision.&quot;44
