History
Akeley Wood School was originally named Hillcrest School, and located in Frinton-on-Sea. Hillcrest School moved, avoiding the war, to Wales; and, in 1946, to Akeley Wood, where it was renamed. In 1972 the school changed from a boy's boarding to a co-educational day school.
A junior division of the school was introduced, and in 1976 provision was also made for those pupils who wanted to remain at the school to take their Ordinary Levels (subsequently GCSEs). The school expanded in 1987 to accommodate a sixth form.
The school grew rapidly, requiring a new site, and in 1988 Wicken Park was purchased to run a junior school. In 1998 Charmandean was purchased and the lower school was taken off site.
