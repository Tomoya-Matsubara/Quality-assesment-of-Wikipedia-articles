&lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwynn (c. 888–after 919) was the daughter of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred, ruler of English Mercia, and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelfl&lt;U+00E6&gt;d, daughter of King Alfred the Great and herself ruler of Mercia after her husband's death. Following the death of her mother on 12 June 918, &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwynn too was for a short time ruler of Mercia. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle states that she was &quot;deprived of all control in Mercia, and was led into Wessex three weeks before Christmas&quot;.
&lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwynn's parents may have married as early as 882 and not later than 887. According to William of Malmesbury, &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwynn was the only child of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelfl&lt;U+00E6&gt;d and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred. The date of her birth is nowhere recorded, but it is presumed that she was born soon after her parent's marriage, perhaps around 888. William's account states that her birth was a difficult one, and that this led her mother to abstain from further sexual relations.
&lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwynn's father spent much of the decade after her birth on campaign with his father-in-law King Alfred and brother-in-law Edward &lt;U+00E6&gt;theling (later King Edward the Elder). By 902 his health was poor and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelfl&lt;U+00E6&gt;d was from then onwards the effective ruler of Mercia. William of Malmesbury states that Alfred sent his eldest grandson, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan son of Edward, to be educated at the court of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelfl&lt;U+00E6&gt;d. William's panegyric on &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan claims that he received a first-class education in Mercia, and it is thought likely that &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwynn will have been equally well educated.
The first contemporary written evidence of &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwynn is dated to around 904, a charter (S 1280) recording the lease of land by &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelfl&lt;U+00E6&gt;d for the traditional three lives—those of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelfl&lt;U+00E6&gt;d and &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwynn—in and around Worcester from Bishop Waerferth and the monks and clerics of Worcester Cathedral. &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwynn did not witness this charter, but she may have witnessed charter S 225 of circa 915, concerning lands around Farnborough, and she is very probably the &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwynn who witnesses S 367 of circa 903 relating to lands in Buckinghamshire.
&lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwynn's mother appears to have died suddenly in the summer of 918. Unlike her mother, &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwynn may have lacked broad support. No opposition to Edward's decision to remove her from power and send her to Wessex in December 918 is recorded by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle or elsewhere. &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwynn is sometimes considered the last ruler of Mercia, but that kingdom was not entirely absorbed into the kingdom of the Anglo-Saxons, later the kingdom of England, until much later. Her cousin &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan was ruler of Mercia only before becoming king of the Anglo-Saxons, and so too was King Edgar ruler of the Mercians under his elder brother King Eadwig.
There is no certain record of &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwynn after her removal from power. It is unlikely that she married and probable that she entered holy orders. It has been suggested that the religious woman named &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwynn who is the beneficiary of charter S 535, a charter dated to 948 in the reign of King Eadred, should be identified with this &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwynn.
Rebecca Tingle's 2005 young adult novel Far Traveler has an imagined &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfwynn as its protagonist.
