The Westinghouse Air Brake Company General Office Building (Known locally as The Castle1 or Library Hall2) in Wilmerding, Pennsylvania is a building from 1890. It was listed on the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation in 1975,3 National Register of Historic Places in 1987.4 Originally built as an office building for the Westinghouse Air Brake Company, it now houses The George Westinghouse Museum.
Construction
Constructed by architect Frederick J. Osterling, the building has a four-sided clock tower, which was operated by a system of chains and pulleys.5 Additional designs and remodeling were done by Janssen &amp; Cocken in 1927, which added the &quot;Executive Wing&quot;, containing executive offices as well as conference and dining rooms.6
The architectural style is a mix of Renaissance Revival and Romanesque.7 It was destroyed by a fire on 8 April 1896; the foundation, being made of brick, stone, and cement survived, however, and the structure was rebuilt upon the same foundation.8910 It was during this reconstruction that the clock tower was added.1112 At the time, the entire first floor was designed for employees' use, with accommodations such as a library, fully-equipped gymnasium,1314 restaurant, swimming pool, and bowling alleys.1516This brought the total area inside the building to . 17
The building also housed a boiler house and light station, that supplied both steam and power to the plant, as well as various businesses in the community, such as the Wilmerding YMCA.18
Business history

This building contained the offices of the Westinghouse Air Brake Company for well over a century.19 The company was originally established by George Westinghouse in 1869.20 Westinghouse had developed many companies during this time of industrial growth at the beginning of the twentieth century. The Air Brake plant, that made for improved performance and increased speed on the nations railways, was moved to its new location in Wilmerding, Pennsylvania in 1889.21 Wilmerding is a small town about  outside of Pittsburgh which, at the time, was only inhabited by about 5,000 people. Socialism was strong in Wilmerding and it was a peaceful non-violent farming borough. It was thought to be &lt;U+201C&gt;The Ideal Town&lt;U+201D&gt; for the company because of its location right along the Pennsylvania Railroad and its mainly blue collar inhabitants. The Air Brake Company employed 3,000 citizens from the surrounding Pittsburgh area, but its work force was composed almost entirely of individuals from Wilmerding. 22
The office buildings were used until the building was vacated in 1985.23 It was then donated to the American Production and Inventory Control Society.24 The Westinghouse Air Brake Company merged with MotivePower Industries Corporation in 1999 to form the Wabtec Corporation (). Wabtec still provides employment for more than 1,000 residents of the borough.25
Effect on the community
 When the Westinghouse Plant was also moved to Wilmerding, housing for the employees became hard to come by.2627 2829 In response to this, the Westinghouse Air Brake Home Building Company was formed in 1919 with $1,000,000 USD as startup capital.303132 The 400 houses and large amounts of vacant land that were previously owned by the Westinghouse Air Brake Company were transferred to the new company.333435 The new homes were specifically built with different variations to avoid the lack of variety commonly seen in industial housing at the time.36 The Westinghouse Air Brake Home Building Company was so successful that within ten years, there were no vacant lots left on the Southern side of Turtle Creek.37 The extensive town-building, employment, and prosperity that George Westinghouse brought to Wilmerding is still celebrated today in the community, with a festival called &quot;George Westinghouse Days&quot;, which takes place in early June each year.38
Museum
Currently, the building houses The George Westinghouse Museum,3940 which is operated by Wilmerding Renewed, Inc.41 The museum is a non-profit organization that was run by volunteers.42 In 2007, the museum merged with the Heinz History Center.4344
