Avi Shlaim (born October 31, 1945 in Baghdad) is an Israeli-British dual citizen and historian and identifies ethnically as an Iraqi Jew.1 He is considered a key member of a group of Israeli scholars known as the New Historians who put forward revised interpretations of the history of Zionism and Israel. He is a regular contributor to The Guardian newspaper. According to The Nation magazine, &quot;he is widely regarded one of the world's leading authorities on the Israeli-Arab conflict.&quot;2
Shlaim studied history at Cambridge University, then taught International Relations at Reading University, specializing in European issues. His deep academic interest in the history of Israel began in 1987, when he took a position as a British Academy Research Professor at St. Antony's College, Oxford. 3
Methodology &amp; Works
Shlaim's approach to the study of history is informed by his belief that &quot;The job of the historian is to judge.&quot; 4
His books include Collusion across the Jordan (winner of the 1988 Political Studies Association's W. J. M. Mackenzie Prize); The Politics of Partition (1990 and 1998); War and Peace in the Middle East: A Concise History (1995), The Cold War and the Middle East (co-editor, 1997), and The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World (2001).
