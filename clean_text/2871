The Brink's Company  is a security and protection company headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, United States. It is divided into two core businesses &lt;U+2013&gt; Brink&lt;U+2019&gt;s, Incorporated, and Brink&lt;U+2019&gt;s Home Security. In 2005, the company reported a total of 54,000 employees and operations in more than 50 countries. The company emerged from The Pittston Company and changed its name to The Brink's Company in 2003. Brink&lt;U+2019&gt;s, Incorporated is popularly known for its bullet-resistant armored trucks which are used to carry money and priceless goods (once used to transport the Hope Diamond from an auction to the buyer's home). Brink&lt;U+2019&gt;s is a provider of security services to banks, retailers, governments, mints, and jewelers. Founded in 1859 by Perry Brink of Chicago, Illinois, Brink's Incorporated evolved from an armored transportation service to the premier provider of logistics solutions and secure transportation around the world.
Brink&lt;U+2019&gt;s Home Security, started in 1983, is a provider of monitored security services for residential and commercial properties. The home security division of Brink's has steadily risen to be ADT's top competitor.
Brink's recently sold one of its core operations, BAX Global, a logistics and transportation solutions company. BAX Global was formerly known as Burlington Air Express. On January 31, 2006, Brink's sold BAX Global to Deutsche Bahn for US$1.1 billion.
1981 Armed Robbery
