Establishment of the National Bank of Tuvalu
The NBT was established as a corporate body under the National Bank of Tuvalu 1980. When the NBT was first established it was a subsidiary of Barclays Bank. In 1985 it changed to become a joint venture between the government of Tuvalu, which held 60% of the shares and Westpac, which held the remaining 40%. In 1995 the government of Tuvalu acquired 100% of the shares.3 The headquarters of the NBT are at Vaiaku in Funafuti, and agencies are operated on all eight outer islands.
Constitution of the NBT
The National Bank of Tuvalu 1980 states that &lt;U+201C&gt;the Bank shall act in accordance with any policy directions in the national interest given to it from time to time in writing by the Minister [of Finance]&lt;U+201D&gt;. NBT has a board of directors consisting of the secretary for finance and four others (excluding members of Parliament) appointed by the minister for periods determined by the minister. The board is required &lt;U+201C&gt;to ensure that Bank policy is directed towards the national interest and has due regard to the stability and balanced development of the economy of Tuvalu.&lt;U+201D&gt;4
The board appoints a general manager for a term of up to 5 years. The general manager must attend board meetings but has no voting rights.5
Operations of the NBT
In 2001 the NBT employed two managers (finance and administration, and lending and operations) and 38 officers, clerks, and tellers.6 In 2009 staff levels of the NBT were 45 employees.7
The TNB&lt;U+2019&gt;s deposit rates are low by regional standards, and lending rates are the same or above the rates charged in more competitive banking systems.8
Between 1990 and 2000 the NBT operated profitably, returning an average 58.3% on net assets before tax and contributing an annual average of $507,000 in company tax and dividends to the government. Earnings on foreign exchange transactions are a major source of income. In 2001 loans and advances were around 28% of total deposits, reflecting the limited opportunities for domestic lending and conservative reserves management. The level of operations in the first quarter of 2001 resulted in A$1.2 million in new lending: 58% of personal loans were for family commitments, including funeral, wedding, and birthday expenses; 29% for travelling; and 11% for education; with the remaining 2% being advances to seamen.9
The NBT has maintained its profitable as of 2008. A review by the Asian Development Bank, related to an ADB facility for the government of Tuvalu recommended that the NBT implementation prudent fiscal discipline to improve liquidity. The changes including the repayment by the government of Tuvalu of an overdraft of around A$5 million in respect of which the bank has a foregone interest of approximately A$500,000 per year.10
