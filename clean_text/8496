Fering is the dialect of North Frisian spoken on the island of F&lt;U+00F6&gt;hr in the German region of North Frisia. Fering refers to the Fering Frisian name of F&lt;U+00F6&gt;hr, Feer. Together with the &lt;U+00D6&gt;&lt;U+00F6&gt;mrang, S&lt;U+00F6&gt;l'ring, and Heligolandic dialects, it forms part of the insular group of North Frisian dialects and it is very similar to &lt;U+00D6&gt;&lt;U+00F6&gt;mrang.
Around 3000 of F&lt;U+00F6&gt;hr's 8700 people speak Fering (1500 of them being native speakers1), constituting a third of all North Frisian speakers. An unknown number of emigrants in the United States of America, mainly in New York and Northern California, speaks Fering as well. Fering differs from other North Frisian dialects in that it is also used publicly on F&lt;U+00F6&gt;hr, not only at home. The municipalities of Oldsum and S&lt;U+00FC&gt;derende (Fering: Olersem, S&lt;U+00F6&gt;leraanj) in the western part of F&lt;U+00F6&gt;hr are strongholds of the dialect.2
Personal and family names
Personal names on F&lt;U+00F6&gt;hr are still today greatly influenced by a Frisian element. Notably hypocorisms and names with two elements are common. Early borrowings were made from the Danish language and the Christianisation of the North Frisians around 1000 A.D. brought a modest influence of Christian and biblical names. In the Age of Sail Dutch and West Frisian forms became popular.3
Family names were usually patronymic, i. e. they were individually created as genitives from the father's given name. Contrary to the Scandinavian Petersen or Petersson, meaning &quot;Peter's son&quot;, a Fering name like Peters means &quot;of Peter&quot;. This practice was prohibited by the Danish Crown in 1771 for the Duchy of Schleswig and was therefore abandoned on the eastern part of F&lt;U+00F6&gt;hr. As western F&lt;U+00F6&gt;hr was a direct part of the Danish kingdom until 1864, patronyms were in use there until 1828 when they were forbidden in Denmark proper as well.4
