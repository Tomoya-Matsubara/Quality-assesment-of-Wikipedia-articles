Marty Mayberry (born 9 February 1986) is a double leg amputee LW3 classified Paralympic alpine skier from Australia. He lost both legs after contracting meningococcal disease when he was sixteen years old. His experiences led him to study medicine, and he attended Griffith University and the University of Sydney where he pursued health science courses. Beyond the classroom, he has written a paper on Meningococcal disease, worked part-time on research about the disease, and talked about his experiences at a conference. While at a music festival, he met his future wife whom he married in June 2010.
Having started out as an able-bodied skier, Mayberry took up the disability sport. He made his national team debut in 2005, and went on to represent Australia at the 2006 Winter Paralympics the following year, when he did not medal. With the aid of a prosthesis, adjustments were made to his skiing legs, and he competed in several skiing competitions during 2007, 2008 and 2009. He was selected for the Australian 2010 Winter Paralympics team at a ceremony in Canberra in November 2009. Between then and the start of the Games, he participated in a few more competitions, including one where he picked up a gold medal, and participated in a national team training camp. He was selected as Australia's flag bearer for the opening ceremony. In competition, he earned a silver medal in the men's downhill standing event, finished 24th in the Super-G, was disqualified from the slalom, and failed to finish in the giant slalom. Following the games, he retired from skiing.
