Location
 Gibraltar has three marinas: Marina Bay, Ocean Village Marina, and Queensway Quay Marina.1 Ocean Village Marina is located on Gibraltar's Westside, outside the northern end of Gibraltar Harbour, in the Bay of Gibraltar, next to the airport runway.2 It is adjacent to Marina Bay which is just to its north.3 The marina forms part of the Ocean Village Project or Ocean Village Marina Complex, often referred to as just Ocean Village.4 Ocean Village Marina is the former Sheppard's Marina or Sheppard's Yard.5 Both Marina Bay and Ocean Village Marina have been incorporated into Ocean Village, between the North Mole and the airport runway.67 The strategic location of the marina offers protection from moisture-laden Levanter winds.8
History
 Ocean Village Marina was formerly Sheppard's Marina, owned by H. Sheppard &amp; Co.9 By 2004, the marina had been sold to Ocean Village Investments Ltd and demolition had commenced.10 The marina retained its original name, at least informally, for several years after the sale. The sale of Sheppard's Marina was not without controversy, as some residents of the marina were eventually evicted from their berths by the new owners.11 After Ocean Village Investments acquired the adjacent Marina Bay in 2006, both marinas were incorporated into Ocean Village, a resort with residential, retail, and leisure facilities.12
On 4 June 2012, the Ocean Village Marina hosted 161 vessels which formed the Gibraltar Diamond Jubilee Flotilla, celebrating sixty years of the Queen's reign.13 The flotilla took place one day after a similar event in London up the Thames. The festivities started officially with greetings from Gregory Butcher, founder of Ocean Village,14 and Ros Astengo, event organiser of Ocean Village. The Gibraltar Port Authority addressed those assembled on the topic of safety, and made recommendations regarding precautions which ranged from sunscreen to the distance between vessels. The flotilla departed from the marina at midday, sailing from the western side of the runway, passing Europa Point, and returning after reaching the eastern side of the runway. Boats up to  participated in the flotilla. Small boats led the flotilla, followed by power boats over , and, finally, sailing vessels. The General Elliot, a Gibraltar Port Authority vessel, was at the head of the flotilla, and was supported by other official vessels.1516

In addition to the marina, the Ocean Village resort features three residential towers, with blue glass balconies, that also have commercial space: Grand Ocean Plaza, Imperial Plaza, and Majestic Plaza.

Sheppard's of Gibraltar, established in 1961 and the former owner of the marina, still has a presence there. The business provides support services for yacht owners from both their chandlery and shipyard departments. Their chandlery shop on the ground floor of Marina Court at Ocean Village has a variety of products for yacht equipment and maintenance. Their shipyard on Coaling Island near Queensway Quay Marina performs repair services such as engine rebuilds, rigging, welding, and painting. Sheppard's attends to yachts at all three of Gibraltar's marinas, and also has a 40 ton lift when haul-outs are needed. Their haul-out work includes hull cleaning, replacement of anodes or transducers, and slurry blasting, among other services.2526 Haul-outs are performed at both Coaling Island and the North Mole.27
