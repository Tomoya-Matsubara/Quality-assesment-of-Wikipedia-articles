Fort Charles was built between 1650 and 1560, the first fort constructed in Port Royal, Jamaica.1
History
The fort was originally called Fort Cromwell but subsequently renamed.2
In 1667 it had 36 guns while in 1765 it had 104 guns and a garrison of 500 men.3
It was damaged by both the 1692 Jamaica earthquake and the 1907 Kingston earthquake which later resulted in the tilting of the Giddy House, now a minor tourist attraction.
