Erdin Demir (born 27 March 1990) is a professional footballer who plays as a left back for Brann in the Norwegian Premier League.
Career
Sweden
Demir played youth football with Malm&lt;U+00F6&gt; FF, making his professional debut in the Svenska Cupen against Kristianstads. He scored the first goal in what would become a 3-2 win to Malm&lt;U+00F6&gt;.1 A move to LB07 was next as it became apparent he would not break into the Malm&lt;U+00F6&gt; first team. At the start of 2011, Demir moved back into the Allsvenskan with Trelleborg. Despite finishing fifteenth and in a relegation spot, Demir was nominated for Allsvenskan Newcomer of the Year.2 His impressive season attracted interest from Swedish side Djurg&lt;U+00E5&gt;rden and unnamed teams in Turkey, the country of his origins.3
Brann
On 6 December 2011, Demir signed with Norwegian club Brann for around five million Swedish kronor. His contract will run until the end of the 2015 Tippeligaen season.4 Former Brann striker and Trelleborg team mate of Demir Joakim Sj&lt;U+00F6&gt;hage described the young Swede as &quot;a modern full-back,&quot; continuing to say that &quot;he is good offensively and stable defensively. He came as a new signing to Trelleborg, but was consistently one of the best in the team.&quot;5
International career
Demir has played seven games for the Sweden under-21 team. In his four appearances during the 2013 European Under-21 Championship qualification he has assisted four goals, the equal most of any player.6
