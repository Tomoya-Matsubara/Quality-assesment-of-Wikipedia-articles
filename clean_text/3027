Udochukwu Nwoko (born 15 October 1984 in Abia, Nigeria) is a Maltese professional footballer currently playing for Leix&lt;U+00F5&gt;es in Portugal. A small but agile attacker, he can also play just behind the strikers. He is not an out and out goal scorer, but prefers holding up play and providing the final pass to attackers.
Football career
Nwoko started his career at Maltese club Hibernians at the age 14, having moved to Malta with the hope that it would lead him to one of the top leagues in Europe. He then moved onto Maltese clubs Mosta and Marsaxlokk, where he was part of the 2006–07 championship-winning squad.
In 2007, he moved to Portuguese club Leix&lt;U+00F5&gt;es, but has been linked with a move to Premier League club Reading in the January 2008 transfer window.1
Personal life
Nwoko is married to a Maltese woman, and obtained Maltese citizenship in August 2007 and therefore became eligible to play for the Malta national football team. He began playing for Malta on 13 October 2007 when he made his debut against Hungary.
