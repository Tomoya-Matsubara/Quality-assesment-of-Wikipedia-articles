Whitefield (pop. 23,284) is a town within the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, in Greater Manchester, England.1 It lies on undulating ground in the Irwell Valley, along the south side of the River Irwell,  south-southeast of Bury, and  to the north-northwest of the city of Manchester. Prestwich and the M60 motorway lie to the south.
Historically a part of Lancashire, Whitefield has been suggested as lying on the path of an ancient Roman road leading from Mamucium in the south to Bremetennacum in the north. Throughout the Middle Ages, Whitefield was a division of the township of Pilkington, itself a part of the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham, and hundred of Salford. Pilkington and Whitefield have historic associations with the Earls of Derby. Farming was the main industry of this rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system.
The urbanisation and development of Whitefield largely coincided with the Industrial Revolution. The name Whitefield is thought to derive from the medieval bleachfields used by Flemish settlers to whiten their woven fabrics, or else from the wheat crop once cultivated in the district. The construction of a major roads routed through the village facilitated Whitefield's expansion into a mill town during the mid-19th century. Whitefield was created a local government district in 1866, and was governed by a local board of health until 1894, when the area of the local board became an urban district.2
History
Toponymy
There are several theories for the origin of the placename, which are discussed in two local history publications. One, published in John Wilson's A History of Whitefield (1979), is that the name comes from the Flemish weavers who used to lay out their fabrics to bleach in the sun (a process known as tentering), although Wilson doubts this because he believes it to be chronologically inaccurate; another relies on the fact that historically Whitefield has been a farming community of open fields and that the name is a corruption of &quot;Wheat-fields&quot;. A third is that the name refers to a field of white flowers, as evidenced by the existence of the area of Lily Hill Street.34
In Remains, Historical and Literary, Connected with the Palatine Counties of Lancaster and Chester (1861), the will of a John Rhodes describes leaving ownership of land in Whitefield Moore in Pilkington, to his son.5
Early History
In Elizabethan times the land which forms Whitefield was moorland and until the nineteenth century it existed as part of the Manor of Pilkington, which also included the districts of Ringley, Unsworth and Outwood.6 The Pilkington family also had possession of the Manor of Bury but the death of Sir Thomas Pilkington, fighting for Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field, led to Henry VII confiscating all their properties and giving them to Sir Thomas Stanley, whom he created Earl of Derby.7
With their seat at Knowsley Hall, the Earls of Derby were by and large absentee landlords who appointed agents to manage their interests in the area, unlike the Earls of Wilton whose lands at Prestwich bordered the area and who oversaw events on their estate and dispensed charity from Heaton Hall.8
Hamlets developed over the centuries at Besses o'th'Barn, Lily Hill, Four Lane Ends (now the junction around Moss Lane and Pinfold Lane9), Stand and Park Gate (now the junction around Park Lane and Pinfold Lane10) before being generalised into the area known as Whitefield.11 The Besses o'th'Barn area was for some time known as Stone Pale and a small street of that name still exists.12
Governance
 Whitefield was in 1853 a part of the township of Pilkington, in the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham.13 Whitefield gained a local board in 1866. Pilkington ceased to be a township in 1894 and at the same time part of the old boundary of Whitefield was absorbed by Radcliffe14 and Whitefield became an urban district, with two wards, in the administrative county of Lancashire. The cause of the boundary adjustment with Radcliffe was that the Whitefield sewage works, which lay between Hillock and Parr Lane, were in the wrong place to serve the Stand Lane area.15
A town hall was established in 1933 with the purchase of the house previously known as Underley, along with three acres of surrounding land. Prior to this the council chambers had been on Elms Street.16
On 1 April 1974 Whitefield became an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, a local government district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.

At  (53.552&lt;U+00B0&gt;, -2.299&lt;U+00B0&gt;) and  northwest of central London, Whitefield lies on the west side of the conjunction of the M60 and M66 motorways, and on the south banks of the River Irwell. The larger towns of Bury and Middleton lie to the north and east respectively.17 For purposes of the Office for National Statistics, Whitefield forms part of the Greater Manchester Urban Area,18 with Manchester city centre itself  south-southeast of Whitefield.
Localities within Whitefield include Besses o' th' Barn, Chapel Field, Hillock, Lily Hill, Park Lane, Stand and Sunny Bank.1920
Whitefield has some substantial areas which are not built upon, consisting principally of the lands owned by Whitefield Golf Club, Stand Golf Club and Philips Park.
The area has three fair-sized housing estates which were originally created as council-owned properties: the Hillock Estate, Elms Estate and Victoria Estate. The Elms estate was constructed in the 1920s and 1930s,21 whilst the Hillock estate was conceived in the 1950s as an &quot;overspill&quot; area, originally for 8,000 people rehoused from the areas of Bradford and Beswick in Manchester which were being cleared of housing stock at that time.22 All three of the estates now include properties which have been bought from council ownership into private ownership under right-to-buy schemes, with the remainder now managed by Six Town Housing , an arms-length management organisation (ALMO) set up by the Metropolitan Borough of Bury.
The area also encompasses the affluent community of Ringley Road. In recent years there has been a fair amount of new building, particularly in that area, on infill sites and some residential development of brownfield sites more generally.

In 2001, a census was taken of the United Kingdom, recording such details as people's age, ethnicity, and religion. According to the Office for National Statistics, at the time of the census Whitefield had a population of 23,283. The 2001 population density was , with a 100 to 91.3 female-to-male ratio.23 Of those over 16 years old, 28.8% were single (never married) 44.6% married, and 8.4% divorced.24 Whitefield's 9,849 households included 29.8% one-person, 36.8% married couples living together, 8.3% were co-habiting couples, and 11.4% single parents with their children.25 Of those aged 16&lt;U+2013&gt;74, 30.2% had no academic qualifications.26
As of the 2001 UK census, 74.3% of Whitefield's residents reported themselves as being Christian, 6.0% Jewish, 1.6% Muslim, 0.6% Hindu, 0.2% Buddhist, and 0.1% Sikh. The census recorded 10.3% as having no religion, 0.1% had an alternative religion and 6.9% did not state their religion.27
Population change
Wilson, whilst not providing references to his own research, reports that the Hearth Tax Returns for Whitefield in 1666 show that there were 135 hearths.28 Further, that the population numbered in 1714 a total of 740; that in 1789 it was 2455; and in 1793 that it was 2780.29 It should be borne in mind that some of the population statistics which he quotes subsequently in his book, and presumably based upon the Official Census returns since 1901, do on occasion differ very slightly from those quoted below.30

Economy
In 1906 the following textile bleaching, dyeing and finishing businesses existed in Whitefield: John Brierley (at Spring Clough); W.E. Buckley &amp; Co Ltd (Hollins Vale); R &amp; A Chambers Ltd (Spring Waters); Thomas L Livesey Ltd (Hollins Vale); Mark Fletcher &amp; Sons Ltd (Moss Lane Mills, having been founded in Little Lever in 185435); William Hampson (Besses); Kilner Croft Dyeing Co Ltd (Unsworth); Whitefield Velvet &amp; Cord Dyeing Co Ltd (Crow Oak Works); and Philip Worrall (Hollins Vale).36
At the same time there were five cotton manufacturers in the area: J G Clayton and Nelson Greenhalgh &amp; Co (both at Albert Mills, on what was then Workhouse Lane); Lord, Frears &amp; Bro. (Whitefield New Mill); Francis Mather (Whitefield Mill); and Worthington &amp; Co (Victoria Mills, Unsworth). There were also two smallware manuacturers in the area, being Prestwich Smallware Co (on Hardmans Green, Besses) and the Victoria Smallware Co on Narrow Lane.37 Also, at least two firms in the building trade: John Jackson &amp; Son, builder and joiners, on Livesey Street; and F.M. &amp; H. Nuttall, builders and stonemasons, who were on Moss Lane and later had their stoneyard adjoining the west side of Whitefield railway station.38
Whitefield's proximity to the M60 orbital motorway and city of Manchester has ensured that there are many small businesses and trading estates located locally. Whitefield has experienced several new commercial developments since the turn of the century, for example with the replacement of Elms shopping precinct by a new gym and several new outlets and with a new Morrisons supermarket built in 2008 on land previously occupied by a public house, the bus station and a former retail premises which had seen several uses.
There used to be sweet factory on Stanley Road - Halls, then arguably most famous for their &quot;Mentho-Lyptus&quot; product, sometimes spelled Menthol Lyptus - and there still is a fairly large flooring company in the Radcliffe New Road area, otherwise it is now small businesses. There is a strong local community, but nearby Prestwich is where most shop.
Transport
 Public transport began some time in the early 19th century and in 1817 there were coach services being run through Whitefield between Manchester and Bury along Bury Old Road, which had been constructed in 175539. However, Wilson speculates that these were probably mainly for freight and states that the Coach &amp; Horses public house at Kirkhams was the coaching inn.40
Bur New Road - a turnpike road, taking an alternate route between Bury and Manchester - was constructed in 1827. Toll bars for this newly constructed road were built at Kersal Bar, Besses o'th' Barn, Stand Lane and Blackford Bridge41
In the 1860s and 1870s transport between Whitefield and Manchester consisted of a four-horse bus running at hourly intervals, with local passenger stops at the Bay Horse Inn at Chapelfield and at the Church Inn in the centre of the town. The firm which operated this service was called Turner, after which Turner Street was named.42
The Bury, Oldham and Rochdale Tramways Company operated a service of trams pulled by a steam engine from 1883. These ran until the end of the century between Bury and Kersal Bar,43 when they were replaced by electric trams leased by Salford Corporation between Bury and Manchester along both Bury Old Road and Bury New Road. The lease expired in 1926 and the trams between Whitefield and Manchester were then replaced by buses, also operated by Salford Corporation.44 In the same year, Bury Corporation provided buses to operate from Whitefield to Bury.45 A bus station, now demolished, was opened in 1931 just set back from the junction of Stanley Road and Bury New Road, behind the then Church Inn.46
In the 1920s the evening trams from Whitefield and Manchester had a letterbox fitted to their fronts, enabling letters to be posted at the tram stops in time to reach the last post collection at Manchester post sorting office.47
By 1905 electric trams were also running between Whitefield and Radcliffe along Radcliffe New Road.48
On 18 July 1872 the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR) gained an Act of Parliament to construct a railway between Manchester and Bury, via Whitefield and Prestwich. This opened in 1879 with a new station, known as Whitefield railway station. The L&amp;YR line was electrified in 1916 for which a power station was constructed near the Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal at nearby Clifton, with substations at Radcliffe and at  Victoria Station, Manchester.4950 Electrification brought down the journey times between Manchester and Bury from 32 minutes to 24.51 The line is now used by the Metrolink, upon which services commenced on 6 April 1992.52 A station at nearby Besses o'th' Barn also serves the area, having been opened on 1 February 1933.53
All public transport is supervised by the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive.
Religious Sites
The Five Mile Act of 1665 had made it an offence punishable by transportation for more than five people to congregate for worship other than in the manner prescribed by the Church of England, and for any nonconformist to minister within five miles of any parish of which he had been a parson. The area of Stand was six miles from Manchester, from Bolton and from Bury, which made it a suitable point at which nonconformists could legally meet. The specific catalyst for the meetings appears to have been the ejection of Thomas Pike from the living of Radcliffe due to his Puritan leanings; though he went to Blackley, those who agreed with his leanings began to meet at Stand, most probably at Old Hall, the house of Thomas Sergeant. By 1672 a barn belonging to William Walker had been licensed for preaching and in 1693 the Rev Robert Easton, ejected Minister of Daresbury, near Warrington, became the first Minister of Stand Chapel. The building had been erected in that year on land obtained from the Trustees of Stand Grammar School and, indeed, the School was held in the chapel on weekdays.54
Whilst preaching the nonconformist position, Stand Chapel was not at this time Unitarian. The transition to Unitarianism was gradual, being completed in 1789 when the Rev R Aubrey determined to follow the doctrine (it was in fact illegal to call oneself a Unitarian until 1813). This doctrinal decision caused a split, with some of the congregation leaving to form Stand Independent Chapel on Stand Lane.55
Stand Unitarian Chapel was demolished and another built, capable of seating 400, in 1818.56
Stand All Saints CofE Church, which was a so-called 'Waterloo Church', having been built to celebrate Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815,57 is located just outside the town centre. The site was given by the Earl of Derby and the first stone laid by the Earl of Wilton on 3 August 1822. Consecrated on 8 September 1826 by Dr Blomfield, Bishop of Chester, it was designed by Sir Charles Barry in the Gothic style of the fourteenth century.58 The tower is  in height.59 The cost of the building was &lt;U+00A3&gt;14,987.60 61 A clock was added to the tower in 1832 and then replaced in 1906.62 The church forms the centrepiece of the All Saints conservation area, designated by the local council in March 2004.63
Roman Catholics were of sufficient number by 1952 that they rented a room at the Liberal Club building, which was at that time on Morley Street; subsequently, in 1956, St Bernadette's Church was built on Manchester Road as their place of worship.64 The building had cost &lt;U+00A3&gt;22,446 and the foundation stone had been laid on 26 March 1955; although the stone bears the name of Bishop H V Marshall it was in fact laid by the Vicar General, Monsignor J Cunningham, due to the illness of the former.65
A few years later, and next door to St Bernadette's, a temple of The Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints was erected.66
Other places of worship in the area include the New Jerusalem Church on Charles Street (there is another on Stand Lane), Whitefield Methodist Chapel, Besses United Reform Church, two synagogues and a spiritualist church.
Culture, education media and sport
One local newspaper that covers the area of Whitefield (as well as neighbouring Prestwich and Radcliffe) is The Advertiser, (one of the GMWN Greater Manchester Weekly News newspapers) a weekly freesheet based in Salford. The other local paper (not distributed freely, door to door) is the Prestwich and Whitefield Guide.
Sedgley Park RUFC play their home matches at their Park Lane ground, and are in National Division One.
Besses o'th' Barn Band, and subsequently its associated Boys' Band, has existed in the area since at least 1818, at which time it had converted from a string band to a reed band. Its founders were John, James and Joseph Clegg - three brothers who were manufacturers of cotton products at Besses o'th' Barn - and for this reason it was for a time known as Clegg's Reed Band. Originally using a room called the mangle room, attached to the old barn at Besses which was pulled down in the 1880s,67 it has had its headquarters on Moss Lane since 1884. At the peak of its fame in the early 1900s this Band, by now using brass instruments, undertook numerous prestigious engagements, including world tours lasting well in excess of 12 months at a time.68
Public services
Whitefield's gas supply was originally made by the Radcliffe and Pilkington Gas Company, which had been founded in 1864.69 This was purchased in 1921 by the Radcliffe and Little Lever Joint Gas Board. Gas was used by businesses, homes, and also for street lighting.70
Around 1883 a Thomas Thorp established an engineering business in Victoria Lane, complete with an astronomical observatory on its roof for his own use. He invented the penny-in-the-slot gas meter.71
