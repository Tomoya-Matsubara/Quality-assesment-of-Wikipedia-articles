Patrick Bingham-Hall is an architectural photographer who came to prominence in the 1990s.1  He is also an architectural writer and editor, and owns Pesaro Publishing,2 which publishes books on architecture and design.
Education
He was born on 15 July 1958 in Aden in Yemen, where his father (Group Captain T. L. Bingham-Hall) was in command of the Royal Air Force base, and spent his early years in London before emigrating to Australia in 1963. He was educated at Sydney Church of England Grammar School (Shore) and studied philosophy at Macquarie University for one year, before taking up photography at Sydney College of the Arts. He left in his second year to start his own photographic studio, and specialized in rock and roll photography, working with bands like Radio Birdman and The Saints. His cover photograph of the Radio Birdman album Living Eyes3 became an iconic image of the underground rock scene in Australia.
Career
He switched to architectural photography in the early 1980s, and traveled the world to study architectural history and to photograph classic buildings. Many of these photographs were included in his first (self-published) book Monumental Irony.4 In the 1990s he took the photographs for many books on Australian architecture, and was selected as editor of the book that documented the architecture for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.5 He also wrote Austral Eden,6 an idiosyncratic history of Australian architecture, and contributed articles to magazines in Australia and England.7 In 1999, he formed his own publishing company,8 Pesaro Publishing, which was to publish many books on Australian architecture within a few years. Bingham-Hall was usually editor and photographer. Most of his early books for Pesaro were done in collaboration with Philip Goad,9 an architectural writer and academic from Melbourne. After publishing Architecture Bali10 in 2000, Bingham-Hall decided to expand his publishing into Asia, while continuing to produce books on Australian architecture.11 He also writes many of the books himself, particularly on tropical architecture in Asia. He is the author of monographs on WOHA Architects, Guz Architects, Peter Stutchbury, and CKOA, and a book on houses in the Asia-Pacific region.
Patrick Bingham-Hall is married to Katrina, and they have five children - Salty Netty Bingham-Hall, Pepe Jay Bingham-Hall, Rosemary Alice Bingham-Hall, Thomas James Bingham-Hall and William Ginger Bingham-Hall. His house in Balmain, Sydney, was designed by Rex Addison,12 although he has now lived in Singapore for many years.
