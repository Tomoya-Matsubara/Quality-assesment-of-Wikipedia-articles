&quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; is the 18th and 19th episodes of the fourth season of American science fiction television series Star Trek: Enterprise, and originally aired on April 22 and 29, 2005. The episode was developed to be a sequel to The Original Series episode &quot;The Tholian Web&quot; and a prequel to &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;. The decision to set an Enterprise episode in the mirror universe originated with a pitch to enable William Shatner to appear in the series. The teleplays for both parts of the episode were written by Mike Sussman, with Manny Coto contributing the story for the second part.
Set in the 22nd century, the series normally follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise, registration NX-01. However, these episodes feature a mirror universe Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) and his crew. The mirror universe features evil duplicates of the normal universe characters, who instead of being part of the Federation, they instead serve the Terran Empire. In the first part, the ISS Enterprise encounters a Starfleet ship from the future of the main universe which is being stripped for parts by the Tholians, and seeks to take the ship from the aliens. The second part sees the crew transferred to the USS Defiant and seeking to takeover Starfleet after dealing with an alien infiltrator.
The episode saw the re-use of footage from Star Trek: First Contact and the creation of an alternative opening credits sequence which included footage from other Paramount properties such as the film The Hunt for Red October. A three-quarters around bridge from The Original Series era was constructed, as well as other sets from a Constitution class starship. A Gorn and a Tholian were both created using CGI, with the Gorn utilising motion capture techniques. The episode also saw the return of Vaughn Armstrong after his main universe character was killed on screen earlier in the season in the episode &quot;The Forge&quot;. The critical response to the episode was initially mixed, but it subsequently appeared in several lists of the best episodes of Star Trek: Enterprise. It was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Hairstyling For A Series in 2005.
Plot
Part I
In 2063, a Vulcan ship descends and lands on Earth, making first contact with humans (as previously seen in the film Star Trek: First Contact). However instead of peacefully greeting the aliens, Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell) shoots the lead Vulcan and the humans rush onto the ship to loot it. The episode jumps forward to 2155 aboard the ISS Enterprise as Dr Phlox (John Billingsley) and Major Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating) demonstrate the new torture device, the agony booth, to Captain Maximilian Forrest (Vaughn Armstrong) and Commander Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula). Afterwards, Archer suggests to Forrest that travel into Tholian space, as he has heard rumours of a technology they might wish to steal. The two begin to argue, and Archer only backs down under the threat or torture. Forrest returns to his quarters where he is comforted by Hoshi Sato (Linda Park) in her role as the &quot;Captain's woman&quot;. When he leaves, he is ambushed by Archer and several marines and sent to the brig. Archer travels to the bridge and announces over the communications system to the rest of the ship that he has taken command in a mutiny. He orders a change of course and tells T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) to help install a cloaking device they had captured from the Suliban.
Archer promotes T'Pol to first officer and assigns Sergeant Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery) as his personal guard. Hoshi arrives as Mayweather departs, and she proposes that she continues the relationship she had with Forrest but instead with Archer in his new position. The Enterprise drops out of warp and attacks a Tholian vessel, capturing it's single inhabitant by transporter beam. Dr Phlox reveals that under torture the Tholian told of a Terran (the terminology for Humans in the mirror universe) vessel they had captured. When T'Pol and Chief Engineer Charles Tucker attempt to install the cloaking device, it emits an electrical discharge suggesting sabotage. Archer questions Forrest, who denies all knowledge, and Reed tortures Tucker in the agony booth expecting him to be the saboteur. Archer has Hoshi send a criptic message to Starfleet command about their mission to free the captured Terran vessel.
T'Pol leads a team to successfully free Forrest from the brig, and afterwards takes back the bridge. However, Archer has locked helm controls onto their destination. Forrest subsequently has Archer tortured in the agony booth for ten hours, but orders his release after he received a message from Starfleet who agreed with Archer's plans. Forrest holds a staff briefing where Archer shows images of the captured Terran vessel which he purchased from a freed former slave of the Tholians. It is the USS Defiant (previously seen in &quot;The Tholian Web&quot;). Afterwards, Tucker threatens T'Pol after he finds out she used a series of mind melds to make him sabotage the cloaking device in order to provide a distraction so she could free Forrest. The two successfully install the device and the ship goes under cloak prior to approaching the Tholian shipyard where the Defiant is located. An assault team including Archer, T'Pol and Tucker transport across to the Defiant. They make their way to the bridge, and Archer orders Tucker to begin powering up the vessel. Four Tholian vessels approach and attack the Enterprise encasing it in a Tholian web. Forrest orders the crew to abandon ship but remains behind as the Enterprise is destroyed.
Part II
The crew on board the Defiant have difficulty releasing the docking clamps, and by the time they do, several Tholian ships have created a Tholian web over the opening of the dock to prevent the ship from leaving. T'Pol and Tucker restore power to the weapon systems, and the ship destroys the web and some of the Tholian ships. The Defiant manoeuvres out of the dock and Archer orders that the escape pods from the Enterprise be retrieved. Tucker is ordered to restore power to the warp drive with the help of the former Tholian slaves left on board the ship. After a staff meeting, Archer is angry at T'Pol for her betrayal, who pledges her loyalty to him once more. Hoshi goes to the captain's quarters and finds that Archer has changed into the uniform of the Defiant{{'s}} former captain. The two discuss the ship's records which includes information on themselves from the other universe for the next hundred years. Meanwhile Ensign Kelby (Derek Magyar) is attacked while in a jefferies tube attempting to fix the warp drive systems. His body is found, and the crew discover after questioning one of the slaves that the assailant is a Gorn named Slar.
Archer begins to hallucinate that his other universe version is talking to him. He decides to communicate with the Gorn who offers to return some stolen components in return for being able to leave in a shuttlecraft. Archer decides to lead an assault team which includes Reed to take on the Gorn. Reed and three marines are killed by a trap left by the Gorn. Archer and the last marine track down the Gorn, and after a fight, the Gorn is killed. With the components retrieved, Tucker is able to repair the warp drive and the ship continues on its way. The Defiant saves the ISS Avenger from an attack by four rebel spacecraft. The Avenger{{'s}} commanding officer, Admiral Black (Gregory Itzin) comes aboard the Defiant for a tour accompanied by his first officer, Soval (Gary Graham). After Black refuses Archer's request for a battlefield commission to Captain, Archer again hallucinates his other universe version. Archer pulls out a phaser and disintegrates Black.
Archer gives a speech to the officers of the Defiant and Avenger saying that they should move against Starfleet command using the advanced technology of the Defiant. Soval and T'Pol meet, sharing their fears that Archer will decimate the Vulcans and make a plan to sabotage the Defiant. Archer and Sato discuss his plan to transfer all non-humans off of the Defiant with the exception of Phlox. The Doctor is summoned to the Avenger where T'Pol and Soval convince him to join their movement. When T'Pol returns to the Defiant, she is captured by Sato and a team of marines, but Phlox manages to decrease the power settings on board the Defiant. This prompts Soval on the Avenger to launch an attack against the Defiant, but after Tucker finds Phlox and restores power, the Defiant destroys the other ship. Sato and Archer celebrate in the captain's quarters. Archer collapses to the floor, discovering too late that Sato has betrayed him and was working with Mayweather, whom she embraces. The Defiant enters orbit of Earth, and Sato contacts Admiral Gardner (John Mahon) and demands Earth's surrender or else the Defiant will attack. Gardner does not know who she is, and she advises him that he should address her as &quot;Empress Sato&quot;.
Production
Writing and filming
thumb|right|upright|The idea to include the mirror universe in Enterprise originated from a pitch which would have featured William Shatner. The idea of returning to the mirror universe in Enterprise was first suggested by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens. In &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;, the tantalus field was used on several occasions and was thought to be a disintegrator. The Reeves-Stevens proposed that it could be explained that instead of killing its victims, the field instead transported them back through time to a penal colony in the main universe. The Enterprise would then come across the penal colony, meeting Tiberius, portrayed by William Shatner.1
Tiberius would seek to use the transporter aboard the Enterprise to return to his own universe, but discovers that it has not yet diverged from the main universe and does not exist. The episode would then have explored the creation of the mirror universe through actions by Tiberius and Captain Archer. The storyline was pitched by Shatner, who had worked with the Reeves-Stevens on the Shatnerverse series of Star Trek novels, to Manny Coto, Brannon Braga and Rick Berman. However, Berman had already received a pitch by Mike Sussman which would have Shatner portray an ancestor of Captain Kirk, who happened to be the chef on the Enterprise (NX-01). The three pitched the idea to Shatner, but negotiations fell through and terms were not agreed for him to appear on the show.2 thumb|left|The episode saw the re-appearance of an The Original Series era Constitution-class starship (USS Enterprise model pictured) Instead, Sussman began development on the script which saw the USS Defiant from &quot;The Tholian Web&quot; being brought back in time, instead of Tiberius.3 It was intended to be a sequel to that episode, as well as a prequel to &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;.4 Sussman developed the teleplays for both parts of the episode, with Coto contributing the story for the second half.5 It was decided to have the entire episode in the mirror universe in order to maintain the events of &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot; as being first contact between the two universes.6 The mirror universe features evil duplicates of the characters from the normal universe.7 Sussman had previously sought to use the Defiant in the second series episode &quot;Future Tense&quot;, but both costs and issues with the plot resulted in it being replaced with a previously unseen timeship.8
The first part of &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; was the 700th live-action Star Trek episode broadcast.9 On the sixth day of filming the second part of the episode, news was received that Star Trek: Enterprise had been cancelled by UPN as of the end of the series, which meant that &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; would be episodes 94 and 95 of Enterprise{{'s}} 98 episode run.10 &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; was Sussman's final contribution to the show, he had previously been a staff writer on Star Trek: Voyager and worked in the Star Trek franchise for ten years. He later described it as his favourite episode of Star Trek, he said that &quot;I knew when I was writing them that they would almost certainly be the last episodes I would be writing for this particular incarnation of Star Trek, so I really treasured the experience.&quot;11 Part of Manny Coto's plans for series five of Enterprise would have included a return to the mirror universe crew first seen in &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot;. It would have been across four or five episodes, which Coto described as a &quot;mini-series within a series&quot;.1213
Visual effects and costuming
The opening sequence featured the re-use of footage from Star Trek: First Contact, where Zefram Cochrane makes first contact with the Vulcans, for which both James Cromwell and Cully Fredricksen agreed to accept Screen Actors Guild minimum salaries. Herman Zimmerman had kept the lower portion of the Vulcan vessel from that scene, and made it available to use for re-shoots.14 While Enterprise was normally shot in digital, the mirror-First Contact scenes were shot on film so that they would match the appearance of the original footage.15 An alternative opening credits sequence was created, which Sussman credited Coto for. It included footage used in other Paramount Pictures productions including Konovalov firing a torpedo from The Hunt for Red October.16 Other elements include an atomic explosion, battleships, tanks and fighter jets.17
Zimmerman led the construction of a full three-quarters around set to represent the bridge of the USS Defiant, which was used from the final day of filming the first part of this episode. It was the first time that a bridge set of that scale from a Constitution-class starship from The Original Series had been used since the final episode &quot;Turnabout Intruder&quot; was aired in 1969. Senior illustrator Doug Drexler was involved in the design; he had previously worked on the research that went into re-creating parts of The Original Series era USS Enterprise for the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot;, as well as a set which was exhibited in Hyde Park in London. Other designers included in the creation of the set were Ahna Packard, Mike Okuda and James Van Over.18 The actual construction of the set was in the hands of Tom Arp and his team.19 Sussman said of the set, &quot;I think the bridge set is remarkable. I hope fans will be thrilled to see that set again in all of its glory. I feel that it probably looks better than the original in many respects, if you compare them side by side.&quot;20 thumb|right|upright|This episode saw the return of Original Series style uniforms, with the wraparound green tunic worn by Scott Bakula as Jonathan Archer The bridge of the Enterprise had previously been recreated twice in Star Trek series since the end of The Original Series. In the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode &quot;Relics&quot;, only the engineering console was reconstructed, with the Captain's chair and the navigation consoles rented from a fan and the remaining consoles were edited in digitally using blue screens.21 Incomplete sets were also recreated for the Deep Space Nine episode &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot;, but these involved digitally inserting the actors into previous footage of The Original Series and so a full bridge set was not re-created.22
Further sets for the Defiant were created for the second part of the episode, which included designs previously used in &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot; for the Jefferies tube. The other sets included the Rec Room, Captain's quarters and the briefing room. Classic Original Series style uniforms were worn by some the main cast in the second episode, although as each vessel of that era had a slightly different Starfleet logo, one had to be designed for the Defiant as it hadn't previously been seen on screen.23 Bakula wore the wrap-around green uniform previously worn by Shatner in several episodes including &quot;The Trouble With Tribbles&quot;, while Trineer, Keating and Montgomery donned red shirts. Bakula joked &lt;U+201C&gt;Did we run out of material for Jolene's skirt?&lt;U+201D&gt; as Blalock wore the science-blue miniskirt in the style of that worn by Christine Chapel. The normal Enterprise costumes also underwent changes, with those worn by female members of the crew having a portion removed to reveal their midriffs.24
Original Series props such as phasers and PADDs were also created for the episode.25 Despite the mirror-Enterprise being destroyed in the first episode, during the second episode the standing sets were re-used to represent the USS Avenger.26 Both a Tholian and a Gorn were created in post production using CGI. The Gorn in particular required an actor in a tracking suit to allow the actors to interact with the character and give the animators something to overlay the CGI on. Stunt coordinator Vince Deadrick, Jnr wore the suit for scenes that required movement, while David Anderson wore it for static shots.27 Sussman also wrote biographies for Archer and Hoshi that would briefly appear on screen. Included in these were references to Archer becoming President of the Federation and that a planet called Archer IV that had previously appeared in Star Trek: The Next Generation was in fact named after him.28
Casting
thumb|right|upright|&quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; saw the return of Vaughn Armstrong to Enterprise as the mirror universe version of his previous character The episode saw the return of Vaughn Armstrong as Captain Maximilian Forest. His main universe character, Rear Admiral Maxwell Forest had been killed earlier in the season in the episode &quot;The Forge&quot;. Both Bakula and Armstrong joked about the character suffering two deaths during the same season, although Armstrong also said of the relationship between mirror-Forrest and mirror-Hoshi that &quot;In 25 years [of acting], I haven't gotten the girl, but I come back here and I get the girl! This is great.&quot;29 Gary Graham returned as the Vulcan Soval, who was a science officer aboard the Avenger in the mirror universe rather than his normal position of the Vulcan Ambassador. Graham was given a goatee beard in reference to the mirror universe Spock from &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;.30
Other guest stars in &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; included Gregory Itzin, who had previously appeared as a Vulcan commando in &quot;Shadows of P'Jem&quot; as well as episodes of Star Trek: Voyager and Deep Space Nine. Derek Magyar returned for his third appearance as Kelby after previously appearing in &quot;Affliction&quot; and &quot;Bound&quot;. Writer Mike Sussman also appeared on screen, as one of the dead Defiant crew-members.31 With this episode, actress Majel Barrett, widow of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, became the only actor to participate in every Star Trek series, including the Animated Series, as well as both the Original Series-based and Next Generation-based film series. In this episode, she provided the voice of the starship Defiant{{'}}s computer.32 Her voice continued to be used as that of Starfleet computers after the cancellation of Enterprise in the JJ Abrams led Star Trek films.33
The episodes saw significant changes to the characters of the main cast. Linda Park, who plays Hoshi Sato in the series, later said that they were her favourite episodes of the show. She later explained that &quot;Mirror Hoshi was strong in the way that Medea is strong, in the way that Clytemnestra is strong, in this very archetypal, warrior-woman way.&quot;34 She credited the role she played in this episode as demonstrating that she could play a tougher character, something which allowed her to gain other roles once the series ended.35
Reception
The first part of &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; aired on April 22, 2005 on UPN in the United States.36 It received a 2.0/3% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2 percent of all households, and 3 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast.37 This placed UPN fifth out of the major networks during the episode's hour of broadcast, ahead of The WB. This was the only time during the primetime hours that UPN placed ahead of The WB.38 The second part aired the following week on April 29.39 Ratings were similar to the first episode, with another 2.0/3% score recorded, and again placing fifth during the timeslot ahead of The WB.40
Critical response
David Bianculli at the Daily News thought that &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; was the best episode of Enterprise so far and enjoyed that the actors could play against type for their characters. He gave the episode a score of three and a half out of four and said that the episode was so much fun that &quot;had they adopted this attitude from the start, &quot;Enterprise&quot; probably would still be flying missions next season.&quot;41 When reviewing the first part of the episode for TrekNation, Michelle Erica Green said that her favourite part of the episode was the modified opening sequence, and described it as &quot;fun and lighthearted in a twisted sort of way&quot; but thought that the closing episodes of the series would have been better if they had concentrated on the real crew and ship.42 She thought that the second episode saw the series &quot;stretching a clever idea too thin&quot;,43 and that a &quot;one-hour 'Mirror' would have made more sense in terms of the pacing and for Enterprise as a whole.&quot;44
Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website &quot;Jammer's Reviews&quot; gave the first episode a score of three out of four,45 and the second part a score of two and a half.46 He described it as an &quot;evil comic book&quot;,47 and regarding the first part, &quot;To call this episode over-the-top would be an understatement. This is a go-for-broke hour of lunatic madness.&quot;48 His view on the second part was that while the re-created sets were impressive, but &quot;it goes so far over the top that it comes back around and kicks itself in its own ass. It's overplayed, overacted, and over-goofy.&quot;49
&quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; has been featured in several &quot;Best of&quot; episode lists. In 2009, it was ranked the best episode of Star Trek: Enterprise by James Hunt at the website Den of Geek.50 He said that &quot;although the novelty value of seeing the cast playing cartoonishly evil versions of themselves is a good enough reason to watch this 2-parter, In a Mirror, Darkly manages to include some of Enterprise{{'s}} most inventive moments, not least the revised opening credits&quot;.51 Empire magazine ranked it the second best episode behind another final season episode, &quot;Terra Prime&quot;.52 Jay Garmon at TechRepublic ranked it as the fifth best episode, saying that the writers managed to include a &quot;gleefully malicious and fatal series of unexpected double-crosses, but also work in some of the most satisfying and coherent mythology gags that Enterprise ever displayed&quot;.53
Awards and nominations
Laura Connolly, Roma Goddard and Michael Moore were nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Hairstyling For A Series for their work on this episode.5455 The award instead went to an episode of Deadwood.56
Home media release
&quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; was first released for home viewing as part of the Star Trek: Enterprise series four box set. It was released on region one DVD in the United States on November 1, 2005.57 The set included a fifteen-minute-long documentary on the origins of the episode and background to the mirror universe in general as well as audio commentary from Mike Sussman and Tim Gaskill on both parts of the episode. The commentary had previously been released on the official Star Trek website, where Gaskill is the editorial director.58 It subsequently became one of three Enterprise episodes to be included in the Star Trek: Alternative Realities Collective DVD set which was released in 2009. The other episodes were &quot;E&lt;U+00B2&gt;&quot; and &quot;Twilight&quot;, and also featured were other mirror universe episodes including &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot; and three of those from Deep Space Nine.59 The Blu ray release of Enterprise was announced in early 2013.60
