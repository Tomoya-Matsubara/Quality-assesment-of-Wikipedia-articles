A date inscription for the Mayan Long Count|alt=an inscription in Mayan characters set into yellow stone

The 2012 phenomenon comprises a range of eschatological beliefs that cataclysmic or transformative events will occur on December 21, 2012.123 This date is regarded as the end-date of a 5,125-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar. Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae related to this date have been proposed.
A New Age interpretation of this transition postulates that this date marks the start of time in which Earth and its inhabitants may undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation, and that 2012 may mark the beginning of a new era.4 Others suggest that the 2012 date marks the end of the world or a smaller catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world include the arrival of the next solar maximum, or Earth's collision with a black hole or a passing planet called &quot;Nibiru&quot;.
Scholars from various disciplines have dismissed the idea of such cataclysmic events occurring in 2012. Mainstream Mayanist scholars state that predictions of impending doom are not found in any of the extant classic Maya accounts, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar &quot;ends&quot; in 2012 misrepresents Maya history.56 The modern Maya do not consider the date significant, and the classical sources on the subject are scarce and contradictory.7 Astronomers and other scientists have rejected the apocalyptic forecasts as pseudoscience, stating that the anticipated events are contradicted by simple astronomical observations.8
Mesoamerican Long Count calendar

December 2012 marks the conclusion of a b'ak'tun&lt;U+2014&gt;a time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar which was used in Central America prior to the arrival of Europeans. Though the Long Count was most likely invented by the Olmec,9 it has become closely associated with the Maya civilization, whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900 AD.10 The writing system of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered,11 meaning that a corpus of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the European conquest.
Unlike the 52-year Calendar Round still used today among the Maya, the Long Count was linear rather than cyclical, and kept time roughly in units of 20: 20 days made a uinal, 18 uinals (360 days) made a tun, 20 tuns made a k'atun, and 20 k'atuns (144,000 days or roughly 394 years) made up a b'ak'tun. Thus, the Mayan date of 8.3.2.10.15 represents 8 b'ak'tuns, 3 k'atuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals and 15 days.1213
Apocalypse
  There is a strong tradition of &quot;world ages&quot; in Mayan literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation.14 According to the Popol Vuh, a compilation of the creation accounts of the K'iche' Maya of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world.15 The Popol Vuh describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous world ended after 13 b'ak'tuns, or roughly 5,125 years.16 The Long Count's &quot;zero date&quot; was set at a point in the past marking the end of the third world and the beginning of the current one, which corresponds to 11 August 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.17 This means that the fourth world will also have reached the end of its 13th b'ak'tun, or Mayan date 13.0.0.0.0, on December 21, 2012.18
In 1957, Mayanist and astronomer Maud Worcester Makemson wrote that &quot;the completion of a Great Period of 13 b'ak'tuns would have been of the utmost significance to the Maya&quot;.19 In 1966, Michael D. Coe wrote in The Maya that &quot;there is a suggestion ... that Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation on the final day of the 13th [b'ak'tun]. Thus ... our present universe [would] be annihilated [in December 2012] when the Great Cycle of the Long Count reaches completion.&quot;20
Objections
Coe's interpretation was repeated by other scholars through the early 1990s.21 In contrast, later researchers said that, while the end of the 13th b'ak'tun would perhaps be a cause for celebration,22 it did not mark the end of the calendar.23 &quot;There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012,&quot; said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. &quot;The notion of a &quot;Great Cycle&quot; coming to an end is completely a modern invention.&quot;24 In 1990, Mayanist scholars Linda Schele and David Freidel argued that the Maya &quot;did not conceive this to be the end of creation, as many have suggested.&quot;25 Susan Milbrath, curator of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the Florida Museum of Natural History, stated that &quot;We have no record or knowledge that [the Maya] would think the world would come to an end&quot; in 2012.26 For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle,&quot; said Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies. The 2012 phenomenon, she said, is &quot;a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in.&quot;27 &quot;There will be another cycle,&quot; said E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the Tulane University Middle American Research Institute. &quot;We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this.&quot;28
Mayan references to b'ak'tun 13
The present-day Maya, as a whole, do not attach much significance to b'ak'tun 13.29 Although the Calendar Round is still used by some Maya groups in the Guatemalan Highlands, the Long Count was employed exclusively by the classic Maya, and was only rediscovered with the decipherment of the Mayan writing system in the 20th century.30 Mayan elder Apolinario Chile Pixtun and Mexican archaeologist Guillermo Bernal both note that &quot;apocalypse&quot; is a Western concept that has little or nothing to do with Mayan beliefs. Bernal believes that such ideas have been foisted on the Maya by Westerners because their own myths are &quot;exhausted&quot;.3132 Mayan archaeologist Jose Huchm has stated that &quot;If I went to some Mayan-speaking communities and asked people what is going to happen in 2012, they wouldn't have any idea. That the world is going to end? They wouldn't believe you. We have real concerns these days, like rain&quot;.33
It is not certain what significance the classic Maya give to the 13th b'ak'tun.34 Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations.35 One item in the Mayan classical corpus, however, does mention the end of the 13th b'ak'tun: Tortuguero Monument 6.
Tortuguero
The Tortuguero site, which lies in southernmost Tabasco, Mexico, dates from the 7th century AD and consists of a series of inscriptions mostly in honor of the contemporary ruler Bahlam Ajaw. One inscription, known as Tortuguero Monument 6, is the only inscription known to refer to b'ak'tun 13. It has been partially defaced; Sven Gronemeyer and Barbara MacLeod have given this translation:  


tzuhtzjo:m uy-u:xlaju:n pik

chan ajaw u:x uni:w

uhto:m il[?]

ye'ni/ye:n bolon yokte'

ta chak joyaj





It will be completed the 13th b'ak'tun.

It is 4 Ajaw 3 K'ank'in

and it will happen a 'seeing'[?].

It is the display of B'olon-Yokte'

in a great &quot;investiture&quot;.36



 Very little is known about the god Bolon Yokte'. According to an article by Mayanists Markus Eberl and Christian Prager in British Anthropological Reports, his name is composed of the elements &quot;nine&quot;, 'OK-te' (the meaning of which is unknown), and &quot;god&quot;. Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes.37 He also appears in inscriptions from Palenque, Usumacinta, and La Mar as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one stele he is portrayed with a rope tied around his neck, and in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years.38
Based on observations of modern Mayan rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod claim that the stele refers to a celebration in which a person portraying Bolon Yokte' K'uh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site.39 They note that the association of Bolon Yokte' K'uh with b'ak'tun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations, such as &quot;erection of stelae, scattering of incense&quot; and so forth. They furthermore assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012, and not the 7th century.40
Dates beyond b'ak'tun 13
Mayan inscriptions occasionally mention predicted future events or commemorations that would occur on dates far beyond the completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. Most of these are in the form of &quot;distance dates&quot;: Long Count dates given together with an additional number, known as a Distance Number, which when added together make a future date. On the west panel at the Temple of Inscriptions in Palenque, a section of text projects forward to the 80th 52-year Calendar Round from the coronation of the ruler K'inich Janaab' Pakal. Pakal's accession occurred on 9.9.2.4.8, equivalent to 27 July 615 AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The inscription begins with Pakal's birthdate of 9.8.9.13.0 (March 24, ) and then adds the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8 to it,41 arriving at a date of October 21, 4772 AD, more than 4,000 years after Pakal's time.4295&quot;/&gt;43
Another example is Stele 1 at Coba, which gives a date of , or twenty units above the b'ak'tun, placing it either 4.134105 &lt;U+00D7&gt; 1028 (41 octillion) years in the future,44 or an equal distance in the past.45 This date is 3 quintillion times the age of the universe as determined by cosmologists.
New Age beliefs
Many assertions about the year 2012 form part of a non-codified collection of New Age beliefs about ancient Maya wisdom and spirituality. Archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni says that while the idea of &quot;balancing the cosmos&quot; was prominent in ancient Maya literature, the 2012 phenomenon does not draw from those traditions. Instead, it is bound up with American concepts such as the New Age movement, millenarianism, and the belief in secret knowledge from distant times and places.46 Established themes found in 2012 literature include &quot;suspicion towards mainstream Western culture,&quot; the idea of spiritual evolution, and the possibility of leading the world into the New Age by individual example or by a group's joined consciousness. The general intent of this literature is not to warn of impending doom but &quot;to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism&quot;.47 Aveni, who has studied New Age and SETI communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a &quot;disconnected&quot; society: &quot;Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time&lt;U+2014&gt;entities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge.&quot;48
In 1975, the ending of b'ak'tun 13 became the subject of speculation by several New Age authors, who believe it will correspond to a global &quot;consciousness shift&quot;. In his book Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth Age of Consciousness, Frank Waters tied Coe's original date of December 24, 2011, to astrology and the prophecies of the Hopi,49 while both Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Arg&lt;U+00FC&gt;elles (in The Transformative Vision)50 and Terence McKenna (in The Invisible Landscape)5152 discussed the significance of the year 2012, but not a specific day. In 1987, the year in which he held the Harmonic Convergence event, Arg&lt;U+00FC&gt;elles settled on the date of December 21 in his book The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology,5354 in which he claimed on that date the Earth would pass through a great &quot;beam&quot; from the center of our galaxy, and that the Maya aligned their calendar in anticipation of that event.55 Aveni has dismissed all these authors.56
Galactic alignment
There is no significant astronomical event tied to the Long Count's start date.57 However, since the mid 1990s, esoteric author John Major Jenkins has asserted that the ancient Maya intended to tie the end of their calendar to the winter solstice in 2012, which falls on December 21. This date was in line with an idea he terms the galactic alignment.58
Precession
In the Solar System, the planets and the Sun lie roughly within the same flat plane, known as the plane of the ecliptic. From our perspective on Earth, the ecliptic is the path taken by the Sun across the sky over the course of the year. The twelve constellations which line the ecliptic are known as the zodiac and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called &quot;precession&quot;, is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a spinning top wobbles as it slows down.59 Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a Great Year, the Sun completes a full, 360-degree backward circuit through the zodiac.60 In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the northern hemisphere's spring equinox, or the point at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. Presently, the Sun's spring equinox position is in the constellation Pisces and is moving back into Aquarius. This signals the end of one astrological age (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the Age of Aquarius).61
Similarly, the Sun's winter solstice position, its lowest point, is currently in the constellation of Sagittarius; one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the Milky Way.62 Every year, on the winter solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, from the surface of the Earth, appear to come into alignment, and every year, precession causes a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10&lt;U+00B0&gt; and 20&lt;U+00B0&gt; wide, it takes between between 700 and 1400 years for the Sun's winter solstice position to precess through it.63 It is currently about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the galactic equator.64
Mysticism

Jenkins suggests that the Maya based their calendar on observations of the Great Rift or Dark Rift, a band of dark dust clouds in the Milky Way, which the Maya called the Xibalba be or &quot;Black Road.&quot;65 Jenkins claims that the Maya were aware of where the ecliptic intersected the Black Road and gave this position in the sky a special significance in their cosmology.66 According to Jenkins's hypothesis, precession will align the Sun precisely with the galactic equator at the 2012 winter solstice.67 Jenkins claimed that the classical Maya anticipated this conjunction and celebrated it as the harbinger of a profound spiritual transition for mankind.68 New Age proponents of the galactic alignment hypothesis argue that, just as astrology uses the positions of stars and planets to make claims of future events, the Mayans plotted their calendars with the objective of preparing for significant world events.69 Jenkins attributes the insights of ancient Maya shamans about the galactic center to their use of psilocybin mushrooms, psychoactive toads, and other psychedelics.70 Jenkins also associates the Xibalba be with a &quot;world tree&quot;, drawing on studies of contemporary (not ancient) Maya cosmology.71
Criticism
Astronomers such as David Morrison argue that the galactic equator is an entirely arbitrary line, and can never be precisely drawn because it is impossible to determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claims he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above , an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than Mayans had access to.72 Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, it requires 36 years for it to precess across any single point. Jenkins himself notes that even given this determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998.7374
There is no clear evidence that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod, Michael Grofe, Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni,75 have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided.76 There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes.7778 It is possible that only the early Mesoamericans observed solstices,79 but this is also a disputed issue among Mayanists.8096&quot;/&gt; There is also no evidence that the classic Maya attached any importance to the Milky Way; there is no glyph in their writing system to represent it, and no astronomical or chronological table tied to it.81
Timewave zero and the I Ching
 &quot;Timewave zero&quot; is a numerological formula that purports to calculate the ebb and flow of &quot;novelty&quot;, defined as increase over time in the universe's interconnectedness, or organized complexity.82 According to Terence McKenna the universe has a teleological attractor at the end of time that increases interconnectedness, eventually reaching a singularity of infinite complexity in 2012, at which point anything and everything imaginable will occur simultaneously. He conceived this idea over several years in the early to mid-1970s while using psilocybin mushrooms and DMT.83
McKenna expressed &quot;novelty&quot; in a computer program which purportedly produces a waveform known as timewave zero or the timewave. Based on McKenna's interpretation of the King Wen sequence of the I Ching,84 the graph appears to show great periods of novelty corresponding with major shifts in humanity's biological and sociocultural evolution. He believed that the events of any given time are recursively related to the events of other times, and chose the atomic bombing of Hiroshima as the basis for calculating his end date of November 2012. When he later discovered this date's proximity to the end of the 13th b'ak'tun of the Maya calendar, he revised his hypothesis so that the two dates matched.85
The first edition of The Invisible Landscape refers to 2012 (but no specific day during the year) only twice. It was only in 1983, with the publication of Sharer's revised table of date correlations in the 4th edition of Morley's The Ancient Maya, that each became convinced that December 21, 2012, had significant meaning. McKenna subsequently included this specific date throughout the second edition of The Invisible Landscape, published in 1993.86
Other concepts

In India, the guru Kalki Bhagavan has promoted 2012 as a &quot;deadline&quot; for human enlightenment since at least 1998.87 Over 15 million people consider Bhagavan to be the incarnation of the god Vishnu, and that 2012 marks the end of the Kali Yuga, or degenerate age.88
In 2006, author Daniel Pinchbeck popularized New Age concepts about this date in his book 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl, linking b'ak'tun 13 to beliefs in crop circles, alien abduction, and personal revelations based on the use of entheogens and mediumship.8990 Pinchbeck claims to discern a &quot;growing realization that materialism and the rational, empirical worldview that comes with it has reached its expiration date ... [w]e're on the verge of transitioning to a dispensation of consciousness that's more intuitive, mystical and shamanic.&quot;91
Frank Joseph's Atlantis and 2012: The Science of the Lost Civilization and the Prophecies of the Maya, published in 2010, links supposed Maya prophecies about December 21, 2012 to mythology about the lost continents of Atlantis and Lemuria, claiming that knowledge of a past cataclysm was carried to the ancient Maya and to ancient Egypt. Joseph connects this knowledge to stories of the Ark of the Covenant, which he claims was stolen from the Great Pyramid by Moses, brought from Jerusalem to the Americas by the Knights Templar, and now lies hidden in a cave in Illinois, awaiting its prophesied discovery in 2012, which is to usher in a New Age.92
Beginning in 2000, the small French village of Bugarach, population 189, began receiving visits from &quot;esoterics&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;mystic believers who have concluded that the local mountain, Pic de Bugarach, is the ideal location to weather the transformative events of 2012. In 2011, the local mayor, Jean-Pierre Delord, began voicing fears to the international press that the small town would be overwhelmed by an influx of thousands of visitors in 2012, even suggesting he may call in the army.9394
Doomsday theories
 A far more apocalyptic view of the year 2012 that has spread in various media describes the end of the world or of human civilization on that date. This view has been promulgated by many hoax pages on the Internet, particularly on YouTube.95 The History Channel has aired a handful of special series on doomsday that include analysis of 2012 theories, such as Decoding the Past (2005&lt;U+2013&gt;2007), 2012, End of Days (2006), Last Days on Earth (2006), Seven Signs of the Apocalypse (2007), and Nostradamus 2012 (2008).96 The Discovery Channel also aired 2012 Apocalypse in 2009, suggesting that massive solar storms, magnetic pole reversal, earthquakes, supervolcanoes, and other drastic natural events may occur in 2012.97 Author Graham Hancock, in his book Fingerprints of the Gods, interpreted Coe's remarks in Breaking the Maya Code98 as evidence for the prophecy of a global cataclysm.99
Other alignments
Some people have interpreted Jenkins's hypothesis apocalyptically, claiming that when the galactic alignment occurs, it will somehow create a combined gravitational effect between the Sun and the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy (known as Sagittarius A*), thus creating havoc on Earth.100 Apart from the fact noted above that the &quot;galactic alignment&quot; predicted by Jenkins already happened in 1998, the Sun's apparent path through the zodiac as seen from Earth does not take it near the true galactic center, but rather several degrees above it.101 Even if this were not the case, Sagittarius A* is 30,000 light years from Earth, and would have to be more than 6 million times closer to cause any gravitational disruption to Earth's Solar System.102103 This reading of Jenkins's theories was included on the History Channel documentary, Decoding the Past. However, Jenkins has complained of the fact that a science fiction writer co-authored the documentary, and went on to characterize it as &quot;45 minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism&quot;.104
Some believers in a 2012 doomsday have used the term &quot;galactic alignment&quot; to describe a very different phenomenon proposed by some scientists to explain a pattern in mass extinctions supposedly observed in the fossil record.105 According to this hypothesis, mass extinctions are not random, but recur every 26 million years. To account for this, it suggests that vertical oscillations made by the Sun as it orbits the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the galactic disc, the influence of the galactic tide is weaker. However, when re-entering the galactic disc&lt;U+2014&gt;as it does every 20&lt;U+2013&gt;25 million years&lt;U+2014&gt;it comes under the influence of the far stronger &quot;disc tides&quot;, which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of Oort cloud comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact.106 However, this &quot;alignment&quot; takes place over tens of millions of years, and could never be timed to an exact date.107 Evidence shows that the Sun passed through the plane bisecting the galactic disc only three million years ago, and is now moving farther above it.108
A third suggested alignment is some sort of planetary conjunction occurring on December 21, 2012. However, there will be no alignment of planets on that date.109 Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth.110 Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near opposition, the Earth experiences less than 1% the gravitational force it feels daily from the Moon.111
Geomagnetic reversal
Another idea tied to 2012 involves a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly referred to as a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100 billion atomic bombs.112 This belief is supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field is weakening,113 which could precede a reversal of the north and south magnetic poles.
Critics, however, claim that geomagnetic reversals take up to 7,000 years to complete, and do not start on any particular date.114 Furthermore, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration now predicts that the solar maximum will peak in May 2013, not 2012, and that it will be fairly weak, with a below-average number of sunspots.115 In any case, there is no scientific evidence linking a solar maximum to a geomagnetic reversal, which is driven by forces entirely within the Earth.116 Instead, a solar maximum would be mostly notable for its effects on satellite and cellular phone communications.117 David Morrison attributes the rise of the solar storm idea to physicist and science popularizer Michio Kaku, who claimed in an interview with Fox News that a solar peak in 2012 could be disastrous for orbiting satellites.118
Planet X/Nibiru

Some proponents of doomsday in 2012 claim that a planet called Planet X, or Nibiru, will collide with or pass by Earth in that year. This idea has appeared in various forms since 1995, and originally predicted the event in 2003, but this date was abandoned after it passed without incident.119 The idea originated from claims of channeling of alien beings and has been widely ridiculed.120121 Astronomers have calculated that such an object so close to Earth would be visible to anyone looking up at the night sky.122
Other catastrophes
 Other speculations regarding doomsday in 2012 have included predictions by the Web Bot project, a computer program that purports to predict the future using Internet chatter. However, commentators have rejected the programmers' claims to have successfully predicted natural disasters, which web chatter could never predict, as opposed to human-caused disasters like stock market crashes.123 Also, the 2012 date has been loosely tied to the long-running concept of the Photon Belt, which predicts a form of interaction between Earth and Alcyone, the largest star of the Pleiades cluster.124 Critics have argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 light years away, could have no effect on Earth, and that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to the Pleiades, is in fact moving farther away from them.125
Some media outlets have tied the possibility that the red supergiant star Betelgeuse may undergo a supernova at some point in the future to the 2012 phenomenon. However, while Betelgeuse is certainly in the final stages of its life, and will die as a supernova, there is no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years.126 To be a threat to Earth, a supernova would need to be as close as 25 light years to the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova will not affect Earth.127
Another claim involves alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, first published in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda128 claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012.129 Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the object in the photo was as large as claimed, it would have had to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived.130
Cultural influence
The phenomenon has produced hundreds of books, as well as hundreds of thousands of websites.131 &quot;Ask an Astrobiologist&quot;, a NASA public outreach website, has received over 5000 questions from the public on the subject since 2007,132 some asking whether or not they should kill themselves, their children or their pets.133 Many contemporary fictional references to the year 2012 refer to December 21 as the day of a cataclysmic event, including the bestselling book of 2009,134 Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol. The 2009 disaster film 2012 was inspired by the phenomenon, and advance promotion prior to its release included a stealth marketing campaign in which TV spots and websites from the fictional &quot;Institute for Human Continuity&quot; called on people to prepare for the end of the world. As these promotions did not mention the film itself, they were misinterpreted by some to be real.135 Although the campaign was heavily criticized,136 the film became one of the most successful of its year, grossing nearly $770 million worldwide.137

Notes

The number 13 plays an important role in Mesoamerican calendrics; the tzolk'in, or sacred calendar, was divided into 13 months of 20 days each. The Mayan may cycle consisted of 13 k'atuns. The reason for the number's importance is uncertain, though correlations to the phases of the moon and to the human gestation period have been suggested.138139
The Mayan calendar, unlike the Western calendar, used a zero.140
Most Mayanist scholars, such as Mark Van Stone and Anthony Aveni, adhere to the &quot;GMT (Goodman-Martinez-Thompson) correlation&quot; with the Long Count, which places the start date at 11 August 3114 BC and the end date of b'ak'tun 13 at December 21, 2012.141 This date is also the overwhelming preference of those who believe in 2012 eschatology, arguably, Van Stone suggests, because it falls on a solstice, and is thus astrologically significant. Some Mayanist scholars, such as Michael D Coe, Linda Schele and Marc Zender, adhere to the &quot;Lounsbury/GMT+2&quot; correlation, which sets the start date at 13 August and the end date at December 23. Which of these is the precise correlation has yet to be conclusively settled.142
Coe's initial date was &quot;December 24, 2011.&quot; He revised it to &quot;11 January AD 2013&quot; in the 1980 2nd edition of his book,143 not settling on December 23, 2012 until the 1984 3rd edition.144 The correlation of 13.0.0.0.0 as 21 December 2012 first appeared in Table B.2 of Robert J. Sharer's 1983 revision of the 4th edition of Sylvanus Morley's book The Ancient Maya.145
