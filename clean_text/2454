Sale el Sol () is the seventh studio album by Colombian latin pop singer-songwriter Shakira, released on October 19, 2010.1 The album cover was released on August 31, 2010.2 In a promotion strategy, Los 40 Principales in Spain premiered the album on streaming on October 12, one week before the album release.3
The album debuted at number seven on Billboard 200 becoming her fourth-highest peak on the chart. It also debuted at number one on the Billboard Top Latin Albums Chart and stayed there for over 11 consecutive weeks. The album has sold approximately 2 million copies worldwide, 250,000 copies alone in France, since its release in October 2010 and is yet to be released in the United Kingdom.4
Recording and production
The album was recorded in the Bahamas, London, Barcelona, and the Dominican Republic. Shakira describes the album musically as having &quot;a strong rock side&quot; along with &quot;romantic&quot; and &quot;Latino&quot; songs.5 Shakira told MTV that the album was &quot;very personal&quot; and would deal with the issues of heartbreak.6 Dizzee Rascal is one of several collaborators to appear on the album, featuring on the first single &quot;Loca&quot;. Of the collaboration he said it was proof of his willingness to experiment &quot;I know it sounds a bit mad now, but you'll see it and see what's going on. It's me doing something different man, on a merengue tip.&quot;7
El Cata, one of the collaborators on the album, said &quot;If I was thinking that this little studio was going to be in the world&lt;U+2019&gt;s vision at this time, I wouldn&lt;U+2019&gt;t believe it.&quot; He added &quot;She told me, &lt;U+2018&gt;You have something that makes me move.&lt;U+2019&gt; I told her it was the percussion, and I said, &lt;U+2018&gt;Those sounds that you want, I have them in my studio.&quot;8 Other collaborations are said to include songs with rappers Calle 13 and Pitbull.9 Aside from calling it &quot;the best album of her career (sic)&quot;, Shakira said &quot;I'm very excited about the new album, because it reminds me of different eras and stages of my career. It's like a synthesis of all these 20 years... It's been quite interesting to make this album, I've been reconnecting to myself.&quot;10 On her official website it was confirmed that Shakira's 2010 FIFA World Cup anthem, &quot;Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)&quot; will also appear on the album in a rockier remix.11
In an interview with The New York Times, Shakira explained &quot;We all go through hard moments. Whatever happened, it&lt;U+2019&gt;s right there in the songs. I&lt;U+2019&gt;ve decided that I&lt;U+2019&gt;m not going to explain every song this time. It&lt;U+2019&gt;s hard to explain a song. These songs explain me better than I can explain them.&quot;12

&quot;I have this gift, and I try to use it as wisely as I can, you know? I realized the weight that I carry with a song like that one (talking about &quot;Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)&quot;), that so many people are going to make it part of their lives. So it had better send a message that is positive, that is optimistic, that brings a healthy state of mind to people&lt;U+2019&gt;s lives. There are songs that are just to dance to in a club, that don&lt;U+2019&gt;t have a big transcendence. But there are songs that will remain in people&lt;U+2019&gt;s hearts and people&lt;U+2019&gt;s consciousness, sometimes forever. There are songs that have the power to feed people&lt;U+2019&gt;s relationships and states of mind and states of spirit. I remember moments in my life that are completely linked to a certain song, so every song has a purpose. But when I&lt;U+2019&gt;m creating a song, I do it in such a personal and intimate way that at that moment. I&lt;U+2019&gt;m not really thinking much. I&lt;U+2019&gt;m just letting it all out.&quot;13

Music and lyrics
The title track &quot;Sale el Sol&quot; is a rock song which calls for optimism through difficult times14 and Shakira dedicated this song to Gustavo Cerati.15 &quot;Devoci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n&quot;, &quot;Antes de las Seis&quot; and &quot;Lo que M&lt;U+00E1&gt;s&quot; churn with longing, regrets and loneliness. According to The New York Times &quot;The music hopscotches across hemispheres, at times looking back to the music Shakira loved while growing up in Barranquilla&quot;. About this Shakira said &quot;Barranquilla is the cradle of Carnaval in our country. All the stuff from the islands and from those neighbor countries, all that music got to Barranquilla.&quot;16
The first single &quot;Loca&quot; features electrified merengue fusions.17 &quot;Gordita&quot; is a latin-rap hybrid with collboration with Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rez of Calle 13. &quot;I told her it was a good idea to make fun of yourself,&quot; he said by telephone from Puerto Rico, &quot;That way the haters can&lt;U+2019&gt;t say anything, because you already said it.&quot;18 Shakira wrote the verses for &quot;Waka Waka&quot; in English but brought the lyrics to her fellow-songwriter Jorge Drexler to adapt them into Spanish.19 Jorge said &quot;If what I proposed was understandable and at the same time a little wild and poetic, that was the choice. She would go for the impact. She is like a fighter. She chooses her punch lines very, very well, and she works on that very, very hard.&quot;20
Critical reception

Upon its release, Sale el Sol received general acclaim from most music critics.21 At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 89, based on 5 reviews, which indicates &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.22
Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic gave the album four and a half stars (out of five). Erlewine said that &quot;'Waka Waka' provided the perfect pivot to the quickly recorded new album Sale el Sol, a set that shows no allegiance to any one sound or language. Shakira mostly ditches the electro-throb of She Wolf in favor for a pan-global approach that&lt;U+2019&gt;s decidedly pop in flavor, sometimes riding heavy rhythms but always relying on melody and texture, creating a tight 12-track record that&lt;U+2019&gt;s casual in its eclecticism but no less dazzling because of its relaxed tone.&quot; Erlewine said that &quot;Despite all these sounds, Sale el Sol never once sounds disparate or overworked -- it&lt;U+2019&gt;s sunny and easy, its natural buoyancy disguising Shakira&lt;U+2019&gt;s range and skill -- but listen closely and it becomes apparent that nobody makes better pop records in the new millennium than she does.&quot;23 Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone gave the album three and a half stars (out of five) commenting that &quot;Nuttiness has always been part of her appeal, with a warbling voice and lyrics that border on surreal. [...] But mostly, her new album is businesslike, serious, sane. The music blends Latin rhythms, clubland electronica and lots of rock guitar.&quot;24
Billboard music critic Leila Cobo gave the album a favorable review. She said that &quot;Shakira's album material seems to strike a much purer chord in Spanish&quot; and that the album is &quot;a mix of uptempo dance tracks based on traditional Latin rhythms like merengue, hard-kicking rock tracks and earthier rock ballads that all told are infinitely more memorable and unique than the singer's baffling 2009 set, She Wolf&quot;. Cobo concluded her review by saying that Sale el Sol &quot;manages to bridge the divide between the old and new Shakira with a spark that keeps you listening to the very end.&quot;25 Entertainment Weekly music critic Mikael Wood gave the album an A rating. He said that &quot;On last year's zany She Wolf, Shakira made a move toward the American dance floor. This time she sticks closer to home [...] Yet Sale el Sol still demonstrates Shakira's boldly global mindset&quot;26
An album review/article was written by The New York Times editor Jon Pareles on October 14, 2010. He said: &quot;&lt;U+201C&gt;Sale el Sol&lt;U+201D&gt; (Epic) is Shakira&lt;U+2019&gt;s latest shift of direction. Her 2009 album, &lt;U+201C&gt;She Wolf,&lt;U+201D&gt; aimed for the international common denominator of electronic dance music; Shakira produced most of it with the Neptunes, a team of prolific, and familiar, hip-hop and R&amp;B hit makers. &lt;U+201C&gt;Sale el Sol,&lt;U+201D&gt; with songs primarily in Spanish, drops that mainstreaming strategy in favor of instinct, whim and glimmers of what Shakira, 33, calls nostalgia. It&lt;U+2019&gt;s full of idiosyncratic crossovers and hybrids, often tied to very specific places.&quot;27
Allison Stewart from The Washington Post said that &quot; 'Sale' showcases Shakira's remarkable voice, as always an indecipherable waterfall of gurgles and growls and coos where consonants go to die and where English and Spanish versions sound pretty much the same. &quot;Sale&quot; is eclectic though not necessarily adventurous -- most tracks would have sounded equally at home in late 2008 -- but it provides a better showcase for Shakira's countless charms than its predecessors ever did.&quot;28
