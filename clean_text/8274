 Wingerworth is a village south of Chesterfield in Derbyshire. It is in the North East Derbyshire district. The settlements of Tupton, Grassmoor, Clay Cross, Ashover and Holymoorside are nearby.
Wingerworth was once part of a large estate, known as the Hunloke estate. The Hunlokes lived in Wingerworth Hall and owned a large part of the village. The hall was demolished in the 1920s and the land was sold. Servants' quarters from the hall still survive, but housing estates are now on the former estate land.
Facilities
There are two primary schools in Wingerworth &lt;U+2014&gt; Hunloke Park and Deer Park Primary School. Half of Hunloke Park Primary was recently destroyed by fire; at present, students are accommodated in portable classrooms in the playground. The nearest secondary school is Tupton Hall School in the nearby village of Tupton.
There are also several local shops, a library and a SPAR superstore.
