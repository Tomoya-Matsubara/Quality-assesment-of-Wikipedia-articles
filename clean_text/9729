&quot;The Love Club&quot; is a pop song.6 Lorde explained the song's lyrical meaning to New York magazine, &quot;'The Love Club' is about an experience I had about a year ago where I met all these new friends and I fell in with them. It happened overnight and I couldn't think of anything but our friends and our situation. Then I started to maybe realize that group wasn't so good for me, and that my old friends and my family are the people I should be with. It's about being drawn into this crazy world, and you&lt;U+2019&gt;re all in love&quot;.7
