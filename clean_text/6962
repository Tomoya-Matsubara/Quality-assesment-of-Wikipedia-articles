Beowulf (; Old English: ) is a legendary Geatish hero and later turned king in the epic poem named after him, one of the oldest surviving pieces of literature in the English language.
Etymology and origins of the character
A number of origins have been proposed for the name Beowulf.
Bee-Wolf
Henry Sweet, a philologist and early linguist specializing in Germanic languages, proposed that the name Beowulf literally means in Old English &quot;bee-wolf&quot; or &quot;bee-hunter&quot; and that it is a kenning for &quot;bear&quot;.1 This etymology is mirrored in recorded instances of similar names. Biuuuwulf is recorded as a name in the AD 1031 Liber Vitae. The name is attested to a monk from Durham and literally means bee wolf in Northumbrian.2 The 11th century English Domesday Book contains a recorded instance of the name Beulf.3 A scholar named Sarrazin also suggested that the name Beowulf was derived from a mistranslation of B&lt;U+00F6&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;varr where -varr was interpreted as vargr meaning &quot;wolf&quot;.4 However, this etymology was questioned by Sophus Bugge, who instead suggested that the personage B&lt;U+00F6&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;varr Bjarki was derived from Beowulf.5
Beow-Wolf
In 2005, Andy Orchard theorized an etymology on the basis of the common Old Norse name &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;r&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr (which literally translates to &quot;Thor Wolf&quot;), stating in parallel that a &quot;more likely&quot; meaning for the name would be the &quot;wolf&quot; of the Germanic god Beow.6
Biewolf
English philologist Walter William Skeat proposed an etymological origin in a term for &quot;Woodpecker&quot; citing the Old Dutch term biewolf for the bird. Skeat states that the black woodpecker is common in Norway and Sweden and further reasons that the &quot;indominatable nature&quot; and that the &quot;bird fights to the death&quot; could have potentially influenced the choice of the name.7 This etymological origin has been criticized as not being in accordance to Grimm's law and Skeat may have recanted the proposal at a later date.8
Beado-Wulf (war wolf)
The editors of Bosworth's monumental dictionary of Anglo-Saxon propose that Beowulf is a variant of beado-wulf meaning &quot;war wolf&quot; and that it is cognate with the Icelandic Bodulfr which also means &quot;war wolf&quot;.9

Origins in Geatland
As told in the surviving epic poem, Beowulf was the son of Ecgtheow, a warrior of the Swedish W&lt;U+00E6&gt;gmundings. Ecg&lt;U+00FE&gt;eow had slain Hea&lt;U+00F0&gt;olaf, a man from another clan named the Wulfings (according to Scandinavian sources, they were the ruling dynasty of the Geatish petty kingdom of &lt;U+00D6&gt;sterg&lt;U+00F6&gt;tland). Apparently, because the victim was from a prominent family the weregild was set too high, and so Ecg&lt;U+00FE&gt;eow was banished and had to seek refuge among the Danes. The Danish king Hro&lt;U+00F0&gt;gar generously paid the weregild, and had Ecg&lt;U+00FE&gt;eow swear an oath.
Ecg&lt;U+00FE&gt;eow was in the service of the Geatish king Hre&lt;U+00F0&gt;el, whose daughter he married. They had Beowulf, who grew up with the Geats. Beowulf's childhood friend was Breca the Bronding &quot;supposed to be the inhabitants of the island Br&lt;U+00E4&gt;nn&lt;U+00F6&gt;, lying off the coast of West Gothland in the Cattegat&quot;.10 This would be a realistic location for a childhood friend of Beowulf, and the poem describes a swimming contest between them.
Zealand and Grendel
When king Hro&lt;U+00F0&gt;gar, his wife Wealh&lt;U+00FE&gt;eow, and his court were terrorized by the monstrous Grendel, Beowulf left Geatland (West G&lt;U+00F6&gt;taland) and sailed to Zealand with fourteen warriors in order to pay his father's debt. During the night, Grendel arrived to attack the sleeping men. Beowulf attacked him without his sword and tore the arm off the beast. Grendel returned to the bog to die and his arm was attached to the wall of Heorot. The next day, Beowulf was lauded and a skald (scop) sang and compared Beowulf with the hero Sigmund.
However, during the following night Grendel's Mother arrived to avenge the death of Grendel and collect weregild. As Beowulf slept in a different building he could not stop her. He resolved to descend into the bog in order to kill her. They fought beside Grendel's corpse, and Beowulf finally won with the aid of an enchanted giant sword stolen from the lair's plunder.
Return to Geatland, Kingdom, and Death
Having returned to Geatland, Beowulf took part in a historic raid against the Franks with his king Higlac. Higlac died during the raid, and Beowulf swam home in full armour. Back in Geatland, queen Hygd offered Beowulf the throne but Beowulf declined in favour of the young prince Heardred. However, Heardred received two Swedish princes, Eadgils and Eanmund who reported that they had fled their uncle Onela who had usurped the Swedish throne. This led to a Swedish invasion in which Heardred was killed. Beowulf was proclaimed king and decided to avenge Heardred and to help Eadgils become king of Sweden.
The event when Onela was slain was probably a historic event. Even though it is only briefly mentioned in Beowulf, it occurs extensively in several Scandinavian sources where it is called the Battle on the Ice of Lake V&lt;U+00E4&gt;nern. For example, Snorri Sturluson wrote:

Onela rode Raven, as they rode to the ice, but a second one, a grey one, hastened, wounded by spears, eastwards under Eadgils. [...] In this fight Onela died and a great many of his people. Then king Eadgils took from him his helmet Battle-boar and his horse Raven.

(Although, in Snorri's text the names are in their corresponding Old Norse forms).
Beowulf ruled the Geats for 51 years, until his realm was terrorized by a dragon whose treasure had been stolen from his hoard in a burial mound. He attacked the dragon with his thegns, but they did not succeed. Beowulf decided to follow the dragon into its lair, at Earnan&lt;U+00E6&gt;s, but only his young Swedish relative Wiglaf dared join him. Beowulf finally slew the dragon by cutting him in half with a seax, but was mortally wounded by being stabbed with the poisonous horn of the dragon and was carried out by Wiglaf. He was buried in a barrow by the sea.
