Australian television broadcasting began on the 16th of September, 1956 in black and white via TCN-9 in Sydney, and has since expanded to include a broad range of public, commercial, community, subscription, narrowcast and amateur stations accross the country.
Colour television was introduced in 1975, while subscription television, on the Galaxy platform, began in the mid 1990s. Digital terrestrial television was introduced on January 1, 2001 in Australia's five largest capital cities.
Public television
Australia has three national public broadcasters, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the Special Broadcasting Service, as well as more recently, National Indigenous Television.
Australian Broadcasting Corporation
ABC Television is a division of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, established in 1956. ABC TV and ABC2 are available nationally, in addition to the Australia Network, focused at the Asia-Pacific region.
ABC TV carries a variety of local and national news, current affairs, and sports coverage, as well as Australian arts and comedy programming. It is well known for broadcasting British programming, primarily from the BBC, ITV, and Channel 4.
ABC2, and second 'digital-only' channel began on March 7, 2005. Aimed at providing 'more choice, more often', the channel mainly provided repeats of popular ABC TV productions, such as Australian Story and Stateline, and was prohibited by law from carrying programmes from a number of genres, however, since the removal of these restrictions the channel's content has been broadened considerably.1
Special Broadcasting Service
SBS Television is a division of the Special Broadcasting Service, founded to provide for the estimated 20% of Australians that speak a language other than English in the home, aiming to complement the ABC.
In recent years SBS TV has began to target a broader cross-section of the Australian community, in part because of the emergence of specialty pay-TV channels aimed at such minorities. In addition to its free-to-air channels, SBS also has an interest in the World Movies Channel.
SBS shows many non-English language films with English subtitles, and each morning shows news bulletins in foreign languages from around the world in its WorldWatch timeslot. In addition to this, a great deal of programming from the PBS, Arte, BBC and CBC, and even Comedy Central are shown.
Acquired entertainment programs includes the US animated series South Park, Queer as Folk and Inspector Rex. In addition to news and current affairs programming such as SBS World News and Dateline, the network also commissions locally-produced documentaries, movies and comedy programs. Less-popular mainstream sports such as soccer, cycling and athletics are also shown.
The World News Channel has been available since June 2002. The channel shows news bulletins in languages other than English including Indonesian, French, Cantonese, Mandarin, Arabic, and German, amongst others.
National Indigenous Television
National Indigenous Television, funded by the Commonwealth of Australia, is produced in Sydney and broadcast via Imparja Television's existing satellite capacity.
The idea for a national, indigenous television service was initially conceived by the National Indigenous Radio Service (the peak Indigenous radio group), which initially lobbied the government to start a new, nationwide indigenous television network. Although no major political party championed this cause, commercial broadcaster Imparja Television stated in 2004 that it would run such a network, at least within its own license area.2 In 2005 the federal Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts considered funding such a station, and conducted a review process.
On July 13, 2007 NITV launched, replacing Indigenous Community Television on the Optus Aurora remote satellite service.3
Commercial television

Australia_television_market_regions.svg

In order to allow for commercial licensing, the country was divided into a number of license areas. When these were drawn up in the 1950s, each major city or regional area - about 50 in all - was considered its own market region. In each of the five major capitals, three commercial licenses were granted (the exception being Perth which did not receive its third commercial station until 1988)4, while smaller cities or regions were granted a single license.
The process of aggregation began in 1989.5 Regional markets were merged into one and (usually) three licenses were granted in the new, aggregated, area. As some markets were formed by the merger of up to six different individual markets, this meant that some stations had to merge or form partnerships in order to remain competitive. Around the same time, many remote market regions were replaced with two satellite market regions - one for regional Western Australia, and one for remote central and eastern Australia - although each of these regions was only granted two licenses.
Some remained un-aggregated, and are today known as diary markets. Some of these were granted a second license, often to the same company that owned the existing license, while other existing two-license areas were also granted a third license, to a joint venture company formed as a partnership of the two existing broadcasters. Examples of these including Tasmanian Digital Television and Mildura Digital Television, as well as the anticipated Darwin Digital Television stations.
Metropolitan
There are three main metropolitan networks, the Seven Network, Nine Network and Network Ten. Although primarily targeted at metropolitan areas, these names are also used in some regional areas (others choose to run the same programming as these stations, but use independent names).
Although the names of the metropolitan stations remain the same accross cities, their ownership varies (see below).
Regional and remote
There are a number of Regional and remote television networks:

Golden West Network
Imparja Television
NBN Television
Prime Television
Seven Network
Southern Cross Television
Southern Cross Ten
WIN Television

The majority of these stations are seen as clear extensions of the three metropolitan networks - their on-air graphics typically make this evident. Stations in the two channel markets generally look very much like one of the major commercial networks, with particularly successful programs from a second network added in.
As with many of the major metropolitan stations, local content is frequently only in the form of a nightly local news bulletin and targeted advertising. The amount of local news provided varies dramatically - some have very little local programming, while others provide local news in most areas (such as WIN Television).
Ownership
These stations are divided between a number of businesses, primarily

Imparja Television Pty Ltd

Notes

One company has a monopoly in this area, as ACMA believes it cannot support more than one commercial television company, but it can support two commercial TV stations.
This rural area was not aggregated during the early nineties, unlike most rural areas. This status is now primarily of historic significance.
Transmission is via satellite for remote areas, and via terrestrial broadcast for more developed areas.
Tasmanian Digital Television (TDT), a digital only station, began broadcasting in December 2003. Southern Cross, as the former sole broadcaster of Seven and Ten programming in the state, has retained significant Ten programming for the benefit of analogue only viewers. It is expected to align fully with Seven once digital television receivers are common enough that significant advertising revenues can be made via the platform.
While there are a couple of areas where viewers can receive programs from more than one licence area (like the NSW Central Coast, and Cobar), the Gold Coast and Batchelor are special cases. Each has dedicated transmitters, on the same tower, for two different regions. Two sets of commercial stations produce dedicated feeds for the Gold Coast. Nine goes so far as to produce a special Gold Coast news service, available only in the area. Similarly, Foxtel and Austar compete on the Gold Coast, the only place in the country.
A licence has been issued to the incumbent commercial broadcasters. This is expected to be a Network Ten affiliate. See Darwin Digital Television.

Community broadcasting
The Australian Communications and Media Authority began to issue community television consortiums license in the 1990s, a group of stations collectively known as Channel 31.The stations broadcast in analogue only at present but are expected to move to digital television in the near future.
Each station is operated entirely independently by a not-for-profit entity and is subject to specific provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act (1992). A Code of Conduct provides additional regulation of the sector.
The metropolitan community television stations, Television Sydney, C31 Melbourne, 31 Brisbane, C31 Adelaide, and Access 31 are unlike the commercial networks in that they have limited programming in common. Some programs, however, are shown between individual stations, and they are all able to speak collectively through the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia. A vice-president of the CBAA, currently the chief executive officer of Access 31 in Perth, chairs a standing committee consisting of the heads of the five metropolitan Channel 31 community television stations.
In addition to these, a number of community stations operate in regional areas - Bushvision in Mount Gambier, Hunter Community Television near Newcastle, Illawarra Community Television in Wollongong, LINC Television in Lismore, Queanbeyan Canberra Television in Canberra, and WARP Television in Bathurst.
In addition to these, groups in a number of areas including Bendigo, Ballarat, Victor Harbour and Hobart have unsuccessfully applied for licences.6
A number of stations with a similar format (but different remit), include:

Aurora Commmunity Television (National, Sydney based)
Australian Multicultural Television (National, Sydney based)
Ballarat Community Cable Television (Ballarat)
Satellite Community TV (National, NSW based)

Subscription television
Three of the four major providers of subscription television in Australia carry a common service, however they have a number of differences. Foxtel currently 'controls' the common service that Austar and Optus resell. This service is known as the Foxtel Platform.
Austar broadcasts into all of regional Australia (except Western Australia), Tasmania and Darwin. Foxtel broadcasts in all capital cities, the Gold Coast, the Central Coast and southern rural Western Australia. Optus Television operates only in the small parts of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, where it has laid cable.
SelecTV is the fourth provider of subscription television, and is owned by the WIN Corporation.7 SelecTV is available throughout Australia via satellite and focuses on providing content in comparatively low priced packages to a number of specialised market segments.
There are a number of other services that target specific language speaking groups, and regions in Australia. There are three region based suscription television providers; Bright Telecommunications which is available in Perth; TransTV Digital which is available in Canberra; and Neighbourhood Cable which is available in Geelong, Ballarat &amp; Mildura.
There are also two services that target specific language speaking groups; UBI World TV, a major non-English language service; and Pan Global TV, a major non-English language and Christian channel platform.
Datacasting
Datacasting in Australia began as a test transmission in Sydney using one of the reserved digital spectrum positions. Australian broadcast infrastructure company Broadcast Australia are undertaking the three year trial using the DVB-T system. The trial consists of a number of services on one standard 7MHz multiplex, collectively known as Digital Forty Four.
The services include; a combined program guide for the free-to-air broadcasters, named Channel 4; a news, sport, and weather datacast channel provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; a government and public information channel, known as Channel NSW, which includes real time traffic information and surf webcams; the Australian Christian Channel; the Expo Channel; and various federal parliamentary audio broadcasts.
In 2007, Southern Cross Broadcasting commenced transmission of a datacasting service called MyTalk.8 The datacast is localised for thirty television markets to include international, national and local news, as well as weather updates. Broadcasting as part of the multiplex on Southern Cross Television and Southern Cross Ten television network's, the service also provides a widescreen video loop of program advertising and regional current-affairs program, State Focus.
Narrowcasting
There are currently four narrowcast services in Australia:

GTV-35 (Broome - link)
iTV-64 (Darwin - link)
TV Norfolk (Norfolk Island)
Westlink (Western Australia)

One of the four narrowcast sevices is Westlink, of which is available to satellite users throughout Australia, and is rebroadcast terrestrially in Bunbury and Albany. The service is funded by the Government of Western Australia and is primarily used for educational purposes but also for teleconferencing, training and corporate services.9 During weekends and on Thursday nights Perth's Access 31 community channel is simulcast on Westlink.10
Amateur broadcasting
 The Australian amateur radio bands include frequencies standard televisions can receive, which have lead to amateur radio operators making use of this by broadcasting video.
The amateur television frequency allocation is roughly where UHF-16 can be found (for simplicity we shall refer henceforth to ATV transmissions as being on Channel 16). Channel 16 is usually used for amateur television transmissions, however, sometimes other frequencies are used, especially those used by satellite television services. Most transmissions can be viewed and heard on an analogue television, but some transmissions require additional or other equipment.
New South Wales
Television Gladesville (VK2TVG) in Sydney conducts three test transmissions per week on Channel 16, including a three hour live to air program on Wednesday nights.11
The Central Coast Amateur Radio Club also has an amateur television repeater (VK2RTG) on Channel 16.12
VK2RFM is another Sydney repeater located at Oakdale. They use a variety of frequencies, including Channel 16. VK2RTS broadcasts from Springwood on Channel 16.
UHF TV Channel 35 was used until July 2001 when the Australian Communications and Media Authority reassigned the channel for digital television.
Victoria
VK3RTV is Melbourne's main amateur television station, and is availabel via Channel 16 at the lower end of the UHF TV Band (below channel 28). The amateur television repeater is located on Mt Dandenong.13
There are a small number of amateur television enthusiasts (amateur radio operators with Television transmitting equipment) who transmit to Melbourne and surrounds via VK3RTV.
These include VK3AAZ,VK3AOB,VK3AGJ,VK3BFG,VK3BCU,VK3FMD,VK3GMZ, VK3JDA,VK3JDG,VK3KBL,VK3KHB, VK3KOS,VK3LA, VK3MN,VK3PB,VK3TMS,VK3TVZ,VK3XOK,VK3XKD and VK3XZA.14
