The Cape Argus Pick 'n Pay Cycle Tour (referred to in short as the Argus) is an annual cycle race hosted in Cape Town, South Africa, usually 109 km long. It is the first event outside Europe to be included in the International Cycling Union's Golden Bike Series.1
South Africa hosts some of the largest, by number of entrants, sporting events in the world with three being the largest of their type. The Cape Argus Pick n Pay Cycle Tour, with as many as 35 000 cyclists taking part, is the world's largest individually timed cycle race. The other two are the world's largest ultra-marathon running event, the Comrades Marathon, and the world's largest open water swim, the Midmar Mile.
The Argus forms the last leg of the Giro del Capo, a multi-stage race for professional and leading registered riders.2
It is traditionally staged on the second Sunday of March and has enjoyed well known competitors such as Miguel Indurain, Jan Ulrich and Lance Armstrong.
Route
In recent years the race has usually followed a scenic 109 km circular route from Cape Town down the Cape Peninsula and back. The start is in Hertzog Boulevard in the city centre, at Cape Town's main Civic Centre. It then follows a short section of the N2 called Nelson Mandela Boulevard, then the M3 to Muizenberg, and then Main Road along the False Bay coast to Simon's Town and Smitswinkel Bay. The route then crosses the peninsula in a westerly direction, past the entrance to Cape of Good Hope section of the Table Mountain National Park (within which Cape Point is situated). It then heads north along the Atlantic coast through Scarborough, Kommetjie, Noordhoek, Chapmans Peak, Hout Bay over Suikerbossie hill to Camps Bay and ends next to the Cape Town Stadium in Green Point.3
In 2009 and 2010, as well as during previous years until 1999 the race had followed slightly different routes, between 104 and 110 km in length - see the table below.4
Records
The course records for conventional bicycles for the 110 km course over Chapman's Peak are:5

Men: 02:27:29 by Robbie Hunter (2008)
Women: 02:48:29 by Anke Erlank-Moore (2007).

By far the quickest time ever recorded (and highest ever average speed) was set on the 105 km course in 1993 by Wimpie van der Merwe in his fully faired recumbent (02:16:40, averaging 46.1 km/h).6
The record for the highest number of consecutive victories within a competitor's age group belongs to Penny Krohn, who scored 25 such age group wins.7
The oldest cyclist to complete the race within the maximum allowed seven hours is Japie Malan (92 Years old at the time) during the 2012 Cyle Tour - on a tandem in a time of 05:49:00.8 He is the oldest man (90 years old at the time) to complete the race on a single bicycle during the 2010 Cycle Tour9 in a time of 06:48:52.10 He is also the oldest man to have ridden the Argus for the first time, which he did in 2004 when he was 84 years old.11 The oldest woman to complete the race is Mary Warner (80 years old at the time) during the 2006 tour, in a time of 06:43:38.12
History of the Cycle Tour
In 1978, Bill Mylrea and John Stegmann organised the Big Ride-In to draw attention to the need for cycle paths in South Africa. The Ride-In drew hundreds of cyclists, including the Mayor of Cape Town at the time. The ride was first won by Lawrence Whittaker in September 1978.
This race was originally planned to run over 140 km, including a leg to Cape Point, but was reduced to a 104 km route when authority to enter the then Cape Point Nature Reserve was refused. The organisers convinced an initially reluctant Cape Argus, a local newspaper and sponsor, to grant the event the right to use its name.13
The event now forms part of one of five cycling events which take place over a period of one week starting a week before the Cycle Tour and culminating in the Cycle Tour. The other events include:

Tricycle Tour (kids under 6 years of age)
Junior Cycle Tour (kids between 6 and 12 years of age)
MTB Challenge (Mountain Bike)
Giro del Capo (5 day pro stage race, the last day of which is the Cycle Tour itself)

The race was stopped twice due to extreme weather, although in both cases many competitors had completed the race by then:

In 2002 due to heat: stopped at 14:45 at Ou Kaapse Weg when temperatures reached 42&lt;U+00B0&gt; Celsius;14
In 2009 due to strong winds: stopped at 16:30 at Chapman's Peak due to gusts up to 100 km/h that blew cyclists off their cycles. Initially the cut off time was extended from 7 to 8 hours due to the strong wind. Despite the late closure many cyclists were affected, because starting for some groups was delayed by as much as 2 hours due to extreme winds at the starting line-up.15
