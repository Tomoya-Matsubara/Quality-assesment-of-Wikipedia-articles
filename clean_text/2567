Cheng Kuang (, Pinyin Ch&lt;U+00E9&gt;ng Ku&lt;U+00E0&gt;ng) was a eunuch of the late Han Dynasty, who served Emperor Ling of Han; he was also one of the Ten regular attendants (Also known as the Ten Eunuchs), a group of court eunuchs who held great influence in the Han imperial court. After Emperor Ling died and was succeeded by his son Liu Bian in 189, He Jin, Yuan Shao and Cao Cao invaded the capital for the purpose of defeating the Ten Attendants, leading to He Jin's beheading in the palace courtyard by the Ten Attendants.
