North London Railway (NLR) Crane Tank was a 0-4-2ST steam locomotive crane tank type. Originally built in 1858 as a Sharp-Stewart 0-4-0ST, it was rebuilt into an 0-4-2ST with steam crane carried by the trailing truck in 1872. NLR Number 29A; it was subsequently inherited by the LNWR in 1908, who gave it the number 2896, in turn the LMS in 1923 (No. 7217, later placed on duplicate list as 27217), and British Railways in 1948 (BR No. 58865). It was the oldest locomotive to be inherited by BR. And when finally withdrawn in 1951, it was the oldest surviving standard gauge engine in service with British Railways. It was scrapped at Derby Works.
