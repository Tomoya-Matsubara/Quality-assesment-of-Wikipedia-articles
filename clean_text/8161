Aaron Neville has had a career as a solo artist and as one of the Neville Brothers. Of mixed African American and Native American heritage, his music also features Cajun influence.
Aaron is noted for his unusual vibrato singing style, which he says was inspired by Gene Autry's yodelling.
With his solo career, Neville is best known for his Grammy-winning 1989 duets with Linda Ronstadt, &quot;Don't Know Much&quot; and &quot;All My Life,&quot; as well as his first - and to date his biggest - hit, 1966's &quot;Tell It Like It Is,&quot; which was successfully covered by Heart in 1980. His other hits have included &quot;Everybody Plays The Fool,&quot; his successful 1991 cover of the 1972 Main Ingredient soul classic; &quot;Don't Take Away My Heaven&quot;, &quot;Hercules&quot; and &quot;Can't Stop My Heart From Loving You (The Rain Song).&quot; Neville's biggest solo successes have been on the Adult Contemporary chart, where &quot;Don't Know Much,&quot; &quot;All My Life,&quot; and &quot;Everybody Plays The Fool&quot; all reached Number One.
Neville's son Ivan Neville is also a musician and released an album, If My Ancestors Could See Me Now, in 1988, which yielded a Top 40 hit with &quot;Not Just Another Girl.&quot; Ivan has also performed with the Rolling Stones and Bonnie Raitt, and played bass for Keith Richards on his first solo tour.
