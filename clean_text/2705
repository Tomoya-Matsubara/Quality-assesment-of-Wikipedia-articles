 The cytosol or intracellular fluid is the liquid found inside cells. In eukaryotes this liquid is separated from the contents of organelles, such as the mitochondrial matrix, by cell membranes. The entire contents of a eukaryotic cell, minus the contents of the cell nucleus, are referred to as the cytoplasm. In prokaryotes, most of the chemical reactions of metabolism take place in the cytosol, while a few take place in membranes or in the periplasmic space. In eukaryotes, while many metabolic pathways still occur in the cytosol, others are contained within organelles.
The cytosol is a complex mixture of substances dissolved in water. Although water forms the large majority of the cytosol, its structure is not well understood and it is possible that the water in cells behaves differently from pure water. The concentrations of ions such as sodium and potassium are different in the cytosol than in the extracellular fluid; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as osmoregulation and cell signaling.
In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes the cytosol is contained within a network of pores that run through the protein filaments making up the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton controls the movement of structures through the cytosol, such as the transport of membrane vesicles. The small size of these pores and the large amounts of macromolecules dissolved in the cytosol can alter how molecules behave, through macromolecular crowding.
Definition
In the early 20th century the sum total of the contents of the cell (the protoplasm) were commonly classified into the contents of the nucleus (the nucleoplasm) and the remainder of the cell contents, the cytoplasm.1 The cytoplasm was further classified into solid structures, such as organelles and the cytoskeleton, and a liquid component that was variously called the cell sap, enchylema, hyaloplasm, paramitone, interfilar substance, or ground substance.
The term cytosol was first introduced in 1965 by H.A. Lardy, and initially referred to the liquid that was produced by breaking cells apart and pelleting all the insoluble components by ultracentrifugation.2 Such a soluble cell extract is not identical to the soluble part of the cell cytoplasm and is usually called a cytoplasmic fraction.3 The term cytosol is now used to refer to the liquid phase of the cytoplasm in an intact cell,4 this excludes any part of the cytoplasm that is contained within organelles.5 Due to the possibility of confusion between the use of the word cytosol to refer to both extracts of cells and the soluble part of the cytoplasm in intact cells, some authors recommend using the phrase aqueous cytoplasm to describe the liquid contents of the cytoplasm of living cells.6
Composition
Cytosol consists mostly of water, dissolved ions, small molecules, and large water-soluble molecules (such as proteins). The majority of these non-protein molecules have a molecular mass of less than 300 Da.7 This mixture of small molecules is extraordinarily complex, as the variety of molecules that are involved in metabolism (the metabolites) is immense. For example up to 200,000 different small molecules might be made in plants, although not all these will be present in the same species, or in a single cell.8 Indeed, estimates of the number of metabolites in single cells such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae predict that under 1,000 are made.910
Water
Most of the cytosol is water, which makes up about 70% of a typical cell by volume.11 Normal human cytosolic pH ranges between 7.3 - 7.5, depending on the cell type involved, whereas the pH of the extracellular fluid is 7.4.12 The viscosity of cytoplasm is roughly the same as pure water, although diffusion of small molecules through this liquid is about four-fold slower than in pure water, due mostly to collisions with the large numbers of macromolecules in the cytosol.13 Studies in the brine shrimp have studied how water affects cell functions; these found that reducing the amount of water in a cell below 80% of the normal level inhibits metabolism, with this decreasing progressively as the cell dries out and all metabolism halting at a water level about 30% of normal.14
Although water is known to be vital for life, the structure of this water in the cytosol is not well understood. This is mostly due to the fact that methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale. Even the structure of pure water is poorly-understood, due to the ability of water to form structures such as water clusters through hydrogen bonds.15
The classic view of water in cells is that about 5% of this water is strongly bound in by solutes or macromolecules as water of solvation, while the majority has the same structure as pure water.16 This water of solvation is not active in osmosis and may have different solvent properties, so that some dissolved molecules are excluded, while others become concentrated.1718 However, others argue that the effects of the high concentrations of macromolecules in cells extend throughout the cytosol and that water in cells behaves very differently from the water in dilute solutions.19 These ideas include the proposal that cells contain zones of low and high-density water, which could have widespread effects on the structures and functions of the other parts of the cell.2021
Ions
The concentrations of the other ions in cytosol are quite different from those in extracellular fluid and the cytosol also contains much higher amounts of charged macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids than the outside of the cell.

In contrast to extracellular fluid, cytosol has a high concentration of potassium ions and a low concentration of sodium ions.23 This difference in ion concentrations is critical for osmoregulation, since if the ion levels were the same inside a cell as outside, water would enter constantly by osmosis - since the levels of macromolecules inside cells are higher than their levels outside. Instead, sodium ions are expelled and potassium ions taken up by the Na&lt;U+207A&gt;/K&lt;U+207A&gt;-ATPase, potassium ions then flow down their concentration gradient through potassium-selection ion channels, this loss of positive charge creates a negative membrane potential. To balance this potential difference, negative chloride ions also exit the cell, through selective chloride channels. The loss of sodium and chloride ions compensates for the osmotic effect of the higher concentration of organic molecules inside the cell.24
The low concentration of calcium in the cytosol allows this ion to function as a second messenger in calcium signaling. Here, a signal such as a hormone or an action potential opens calcium channels and either allow calcium to flood into the cell from outside, or release the ion from stores within organelles.25 This sudden increase in cytosolic calcium activates other signalling molecules, such as calmodulin and protein kinase c.26
Proteins
Protein molecules that do not bind to cell membranes or the cytoskeleton will be dissolved in the cytosol. The amount of protein in cells is extremely high, and approaches 200 mg/ml, occupying about 20-30% of the volume of the cytosol.27 However, measuring precisely how much protein is dissolved in cytosol in intact cells is difficult, since some proteins appear to be weakly-associated with membranes or organelles in whole cells and are released into solution upon cell lysis.28 However, the idea that the majority of the proteins in cells are bound to structures to form a network called the microtrabecular lattice is now seen as unlikely.29
This high concentration of proteins in cytosol causes an effect called macromolecular crowding, which is when the effective concentration of other macromolecules is increased, since they have less volume to move in. This crowding effect can produce large changes in both the rates and the position of chemical equilibrium of reactions in the cytosol.30 It is particularly important in its ability to alter dissociation constants by favoring the association of macromolecules, such as when multiple proteins come together to form protein complexes, or when DNA-binding proteins bind to their targets in the genome.31
Organization
Although the components of the cytosol are not separated into regions by cell membranes, these components do not always mix randomly and several levels of organization can localize specific molecules to defined sites within the cytosol.32
Protein complexes
Proteins can associate to form protein complexes, these often contain a set of proteins with similar functions, such as enzymes that carry out several steps in the same metabolic pathway.33 This organization can allow substrate channeling, which is when the product of one enzyme is passed directly to the next enzyme in a pathway without being released into solution.34 Channeling can make a pathway more rapid and efficient than it would be if the enzymes were randomly distributed in the cytosol or prevent the release of unstable intermediates.35 Although a wide variety of metabolic pathways have been shown to involve enzymes that are tightly bound to each other, others may involve more loosely-associated complexes that are very difficult to study outside the cell.3637 Consequently, the importance of these complexes for metabolism in general remains unclear.
Protein compartments
Some protein complexes contain a large central cavity that is isolated from the reminder of the cytosol. One example of such an enclosed compartment is the proteasome.
