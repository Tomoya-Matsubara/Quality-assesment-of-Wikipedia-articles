Suicide (Latin suicidium, from sui caedere, &quot;to kill oneself&quot;) is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Suicide is often committed out of despair, or attributed to some underlying mental disorder which includes depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, alcoholism and drug abuse.1 Pressures or misfortunes such as financial difficulties or troubles with interpersonal relationships may play a significant role.2
Over one million people die by suicide every year. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that it is the thirteenth-leading cause of death worldwide3 and the National Safety Council rates it sixth in the United States.4 It is a leading cause of death among teenagers and adults under 35.56 The rate of suicide is far higher in men than in women, with males worldwide three to four times more likely to kill themselves than females.78 There are an estimated 10 to 20Â million non-fatal attempted suicides every year worldwide.9
Views on suicide have been influenced by broader cultural views on existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions consider suicide an offense towards God due to religious belief in the sanctity of life. It was often regarded as a serious crime and that view is common in modern Western thought. Before the rise of Christianity, suicide was not seen as automatically immoral in ancient Greek and Roman culture. Conversely, during the samurai era in Japan, seppuku was respected as a means of atonement for failure or as a form of protest. Sati is a Hindu funeral practice, now outlawed, in which the widow was expected to immolate herself on her husband's funeral pyre, either willingly or under pressure from the family and in-laws.10 In the 20th century, suicide in the form of self-immolation has been used as a form of protest, and in the form of kamikaze and suicide bombing as a military or terrorist tactic.
Medically assisted suicide (euthanasia, or the right to die) is currently a controversial ethical issue involving people who are terminally ill, in extreme pain, or have (perceived or construed) minimal quality of life through injury or illness. Self-sacrifice for others is not always considered suicide, as the goal is not to kill oneself but to save another; however, &lt;U+00C9&gt;mile Durkheim's theory termed such acts &quot;altruistic suicide.&quot;11 
Classification
Self-harm

Self-harm is not a suicide attempt; however, initially self-harm was erroneously classified as a suicide attempt. There is a non-causal correlation between self-harm and suicide; both are most commonly a joint effect of depression.12 This may also be classified as Deliberate self-harm and is most common in younger people but has been increasing in recent years in people of all ages.13
Euthanasia and assisted suicide

 Individuals who wish to end their own lives may enlist the assistance of another person to achieve death. The other person, usually a family member or physician, may help carry out the act if the individual lacks the physical capacity to do so even with the supplied means. Assisted suicide is a contentious moral and political issue in many countries, as seen in the scandal surrounding Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a medical practitioner who supported euthanasia, was found to have helped patients end their own lives, and was sentenced to prison time.
Murder&lt;U+2013&gt;suicide

A murder&lt;U+2013&gt;suicide is an act in which an individual kills one or more other persons immediately before or at the same time as him or herself.
The motivation for the murder in murder&lt;U+2013&gt;suicide can be purely criminal in nature or be perceived by the perpetrator as an act of care for loved ones in the context of severe depression.
Suicide attack

A suicide attack is when an attacker perpetrates an act of violence against others, typically to achieve a military or political goal, which results in his or her own death as well. Suicide bombings are often regarded as an act of terrorism. Historical examples include the assassination of Czar Alexander II and the partly successful kamikaze attacks by Japanese air pilots during the Second World War, as well as more recent attacks, such as the September 11th attacks.
Mass suicide

Some suicides are done under peer pressure or as a group. Mass suicides can take place with as few as two people, in a &quot;suicide pact&quot;, or with a larger number of people. An example is the mass suicide that took place by members of the Peoples Temple, an American cult led by Jim Jones in Guyana in 1978.
Suicide pact

A suicide pact describes the suicides of two or more individuals in an agreed-upon plan. The plan may be to die together, or separately and closely timed. Suicide pacts are generally distinct from mass suicide. The latter refers to incidents in which a larger number of people kill themselves together for the same ideological reason, often within a religious, political, military or paramilitary context. Suicide pacts, on the other hand, usually involve small groups of people (such as married or romantic partners, family members, or friends) whose motivations are intensely personal and individual.
Risk factors
 A number of factors are associated with the risk of suicide including: mental illness, drug addiction, availability of methods, family history, and socio-economic factors.14 While external circumstances, such as a traumatic event, may trigger suicide it does not seem to be an independent cause.
Mental disorders
Mental disorders are frequently present at the time of suicide. It is estimated that from 87%15 to 98% of suicide victims suffer from some type of mental disorder.16 When broken down into type of mental disorder among suicides, mood disorders are present in 30%, substance abuse in 18%, schizophrenia in 14%, and personality disorders in 13% of suicides.17 About 5% of people with schizophrenia die of suicide.18 The disorders most associated with completed suicide are major depression and alcoholism. In people with mood disorders (major depressive disorders and bipolar disorders) the risk for suicide is approximately 15 percent, with the greatest risk in the early stages of the illness.19
Depression, one of the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorders2021 is being diagnosed in increasing numbers in various segments of the population worldwide,2223 and is often a precipitating factor in suicide. Depression in the United States alone affects 17.6 million Americans each year or 1 in 6 people. Within the next twenty years depression is expected to become the second leading cause of disability worldwide and the leading cause in high-income nations, including the United States.
Substance abuse
Substance abuse is the second most common risk factor for suicide after mood disorders.24 Both chronic substance misuse as well as acute substance abuse are associated with suicide. This is attributed to the intoxicating and disinhibiting effects of many psychoactive substances; when combined with personal grief such as bereavement the risk of suicide is greatly increased.25 More than 50% of suicides are related to alcohol or drug use and up to 25% of suicides are committed by drug addicts and alcoholics. In adolescents the figure is higher with alcohol or drug misuse playing a role in up to 70% of suicides. It has been recommended that all drug addicts or alcoholics undergo investigation for suicidal thoughts due to their high risk of suicide.26 An investigation in the New York Prison Service found that 90% of inmates who committed suicide had a history of substance abuse.27 Cigarette smoking is also associated.28
Cocaine
Misuse of drugs such as cocaine have a high correlation with suicide. Suicide is most likely to occur during the &quot;crash&quot; or withdrawal phase of cocaine in chronic cocaine-dependent users. Polysubstance misuse has been found to more often result in suicide in younger adults whereas suicide from alcoholism is more common in older adults. In San Diego it was found that 30% of suicides in people under the age of 30 had used cocaine. In New York City during a crack epidemic one in five people who committed suicide were found to have recently consumed cocaine. The &quot;come down&quot; or withdrawal phase from cocaine can result in intense depressive symptoms coupled with other distressing mental effects which contribute to the increased risk of suicide.2930
Methamphetamine
Methamphetamine use has a high association with depression and suicide as well as a range of other adverse effects on physical and mental health.31
Opioids
Heroin users have a death rate 13 times that of their peers, and deaths among heroin users attributed to suicide range from 3 to 35%. Overall, heroin users are 14 times more likely than peers to die from suicide.32 Major depressive disorder was found in 25% of entrants to treatment for heroin dependence in Australia.33
Alcohol

Alcohol misuse is associated with a number of mental health disorders, and alcoholics have a very high suicide rate.34 It has been found that drinking 6 drinks or more per day results in a sixfold increased risk of suicide.3536 High rates of major depressive disorder occur in heavy drinkers and those who misuse alcohol. Controversy has previously surrounded whether those who misused alcohol who developed major depressive disorder were self medicating (which may be true in some cases) but recent research has now concluded that chronic excessive alcohol intake itself directly causes the development of major depressive disorder in a significant number of alcoholics.37
Benzodiazepines

Chronic prescribed benzodiazepine use or chronic misuse is associated with depression as well as suicide. Care should be taken when prescribing especially to at-risk patients.383940 Depressed adolescents who were taking benzodiazepines were found to have a greatly increased risk of self harm or suicide, although the sample size was small. The effects of benzodiazepines in individuals under the age of 18 requires further research. Additional caution is required in using benzodiazepines in depressed adolescents.41 Benzodiazepine dependence often results in an increasingly deteriorating clinical picture which includes social deterioration leading to comorbid alcoholism and drug abuse. Suicide is a common outcome of chronic benzodiazepine dependence. Benzodiazepine misuse or misuse of other CNS depressants increases the risk of suicide in drug misusers.4243 11% of males and 23% of females with a sedative hypnotic misuse habit commit suicide.44 Benzodiazepine withdrawal also leads to an increased risk of suicide.45
Cigarette smoking
There have been various studies showing a positive link between smoking, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.4647 In a study conducted among nurses, those smoking between 1 to 24 cigarettes per day had twice the suicide risk; 25 cigarettes or more, 4 times the suicide risk, as compared with those who had never smoked.4849 In a study of 300,000 male U.S. Army soldiers, a definitive link between suicide and smoking was observed with those soldiers smoking over a pack a day having twice the suicide rate of non-smokers.50
Problem gambling
Problem gambling is often associated with increased suicidal ideation and attempts compared to the general population.515253
Early onset of problem gambling increases the lifetime risk of suicide.54 However, gambling-related suicide attempts are usually made by older people with problem gambling.55 Both comorbid substance use5657 and comorbid mental disorders increase the risk of suicide in people with problem gambling.58
A 2010 Australian hospital study found that 17% of suicidal patients admitted to the Alfred Hospital's emergency department were problem gamblers.59
Medical conditions
In various studies a significant association was found between suicidality and underlying medical conditions including chronic pain,60 mild brain injury, (MBI) or traumatic brain injury (TBI)6162 The prevalence of increased suicidality persisted after adjusting for depressive illness and alcohol abuse. In patients with more than one medical condition the risk was particulaly high, suggesting a need for increased screening for suicidality in general medical settings.6364
A careful medical evaluation is recommended for all people presenting with psychiatric symptoms as many medical conditions present with psychiatric symptomatology. The major medical conditions presenting with psychiatric symptoms in order of frequency were infectious, pulmonary, thyroid, diabetic, hematopoietic, hepatic and CNS diseases.65 Conservative estimates are, that 10% of all psychological symptoms may be due to undiagnosed medical conditions66 with the results of one study, suggesting that about 50% of individuals with a serious mental illness &quot;have general medical conditions that are largely undiagnosed and untreated and may cause or exacerbate psychiatric symptoms&quot;6768
Biological
Genetics has an effect on suicide risk69 accounting for 30&lt;U+2013&gt;50% of the variance.70 Much of this relationship acts through the heritability of mental illness.71 There is also evidence to suggest that if a parent has committed suicide, it is a strong predictor of suicide attempts among the offspring.72
An evolutionary psychology explanation for suicide is that suicide may under some circumstances improve the reproductive success of relatives of the person committing suicide and thus also the overall reproductive success (inclusive fitness) of the person committing suicide. This may occur if the person committing suicide will not have more children (even if not committing suicide) and takes away resources from relatives by staying alive. This theory predicts that suicide may be especially likely if a person perceives that he or she is a burden to others, especially relatives, and with no hope of future improvement. In support of this several studies have found that perceived burdensomeness to others is a strong predictor of suicidal thoughs, suicidality, lethality of suicide method, and successful suicide. Joiner et al. argue that there is also other research that is be consistent with the theory such that &quot;genuine suicide attempts were often characterize by a desire to make others better off, whereas nonsuicidal self-injury was often characterized by desires to express anger or punish oneself.&quot; An objection is that while some suicides may increase the inclusive fitness of a person, in other cases, such as healthy adolescents committing suicide, this likely decrease overall reproductive success even if also including the reproductive success of relatives. A response is that such cases may be due malfunctioning psychological mechanisms (in the sense of increasing inclusive fitness). Evolutionary psychology argue that many human psychological features are adaptations to the ancestral envrionment which was very different from the current one. Psychological mechanisms that may have usually increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment may not do so in today's environment.7374
Media coverage

Various studies have suggested that how the media presents depictions of suicide may have a negative effect75 and trigger the possibility of suicide contagion also known as the Werther effect named after the protagonist in Goethe's, The Sorrows of Young Werther who committed suicide.7677 This risk is greater in adoloescents who may romantacize death.787980 It appears that while news media has a significant effect that of entertainment media is equivocal.81
The opposite of the Werther effect is the Papageno effect in which coverage of effective coping mechanisms, coping in adverse circumstances, as covered in the media about suicidal ideation, may have protective effects. The term is based upon a character in Mozart&lt;U+2019&gt;s opera The Magic Flute named Papageno who fearing the loss of a loved one was going to commit suicide until three boys showed him different ways to cope.82
Social
As a form of defiance or protest

In Ireland protesting via hunger strike to the death has been used as a tactic in recent times for political causes. During The Troubles in Northern Ireland a hunger strike was launched by the provisional IRA to demand that their prisoners be reclassified as prisoners of war rather than as terrorists, during the infamous 1981 hunger strikes, led by Bobby Sands; this protest resulted in 10 deaths. The cause of death was recorded as &quot;starvation, self-imposed&quot; rather than suicide by the coroner, modified to simply &quot;starvation&quot; on the death certificates after protests from the striker's families.83
Judicial suicide

A person who has committed a crime may commit suicide to avoid prosecution and disgrace, such as in murder&lt;U+2013&gt;suicides. Nazi leader Hermann G&lt;U+00F6&gt;ring, a high-ranked Nazi and head of the Luftwaffe, committed suicide with cyanide capsules rather than be hanged after his conviction at the Nuremberg Trials.84 Some school shootings, including the Columbine and Virginia Tech massacres, concluded with the perpetrators committing suicide.
Military suicide

 In the final days of World War II, some Japanese pilots volunteered for kamikaze missions in an attempt to forestall defeat for the Empire of Japan, while Japanese ground forces initiated banzai charges. Near the end of WWII the Japanese designed the Ohka, a small aircraft whose only purpose was kamikaze missions. Similarly, units of the Luftwaffe flew Selbstopfereinsatz (self-sacrifice missions) against Soviet bridges.
Dutiful suicide
Dutiful suicide is an act, or non-fatal attempt at the act, of fatal self-violence at one's own hands done in the belief that it will secure a greater good, rather than to escape harsh or impossible conditions. It can be voluntary, to relieve some dishonor or punishment, or imposed by threats of death or reprisals on one's family or reputation (a kind of murder by remote control). It can be culturally traditional or generally abhorred; it can be heavily ritualized as in seppuku or purely functional. Dutiful suicide can be distinguished from a kamikaze or suicide bomb attack, in which a fighter consumes his own life in delivering a weapon to the enemy.
Disgraced Roman aristocrats were sometimes allowed to commit suicide to spare themselves a trial and penalties against their families. An example of this was Emperor Nero who reportedly committed forced suicide facing a revolt and execution.85 A more modern case is Erwin Rommel, who was found to have foreknowledge of the July 20 Plot on Hitler's life. Rommel was threatened with public trial, execution and reprisals on his family unless he killed himself, which he did.86
Suicide as an escape
In situations where continuing to live is intolerable, some people use suicide as a means of escape. Some inmates in Nazi concentration camps are known to have killed themselves by deliberately touching the electrified fences.
As Germany faced inevitable defeat in mid&lt;U+2013&gt;1945, there were unprecedented waves of suicides amongst Germans in the final weeks of the war (see Mass suicides in 1945 Nazi Germany) These included many senior figures in the regime (e.g., Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler and Joseph Goebbels), as well as many ordinary people who were fearful of suffering atrocities at the hands of the advancing Red Army.87 The behaviour of Soviet troops also played a role, as many Germans committed suicide to avoid rape or out of shame at having been raped.88
Emperor Tewodros II of Ethiopia, facing defeat at the hands of the British expeditionary force committed suicide rather than be taken captive, announcing &quot;&quot;It is finished! Sooner than fall into his hands I will kill myself&quot;.89
According to a report by Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai, 150,000 debt-ridden farmers in India have committed suicide in the past decade.90
Other
Socio-economic factors such as unemployment, poverty, homelessness, and discrimination may trigger suicidal thoughts.91 Poverty may not be a direct cause but it can increase the risk of suicide, as it is a major risk group for depression.92 Advocacy of suicide has been cited as a contributing factor. Intelligence may also factor. Initially proposed as a part of an evolutionary psychology explanation, which posited a minimum intelligence required for one to commit suicide, the positive correlation between IQ and suicide has been replicated in a number of studies.9394959697 Some scientists doubt however that intelligence can be a cause of suicide,98 and the intelligence is no longer a predictor of suicide when regressed with national religiousness and perceptions of personal health.99 According to the American Psychiatric Association, &quot;religiously unaffiliated subjects had significantly more lifetime suicide attempts and more first-degree relatives who committed suicide than subjects who endorsed a religious affiliation.&quot;100 Moreover, individuals with no religious affiliation had fewer moral objections to suicide than believers.101
One study found that a lack of social support, a deficit in feelings of belongingness and living alone were crucial predictors of a suicide attempt.102 One study found that among prison inmates, suicide was more likely among inmates who had committed a violent crime.103
Methods
  The leading method of suicide varies dramatically between countries. The leading methods in different regions include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms.104 A 2008 review of 56 countries based on WHO mortality data found that hanging was the most common method in most of the countries,Ajdacic-Gross, Vladeta, et al. . Bulletin of the World Health Organization 86 (9): 726&lt;U+2013&gt;732. September 2008. Accessed 2 August 2011. Archived 2 August 2011. See html version.

The data can be seen here. accounting for 53 percent of the male suicides and 39 percent of the female suicides.105 Worldwide 30% of suicides are from pesticides. The use of this method however varies markedly from 4% in Europe to more than 50% in the Pacific region.106 In the United States 52% of suicides involve the use of firearms.107 Asphyxiation (such as with a suicide bag) and poisoning are fairly common as well. Together they comprised about 40% of U.S. suicides. Other methods of suicide include blunt force trauma (jumping from a building or bridge, self-defenestrating, stepping in front of a train, or car collision, for example). Exsanguination or bloodletting (slitting one's wrist or throat), intentional drowning, self-immolation, electrocution, and intentional starvation are other suicide methods. Individuals may also intentionally provoke another person into administering lethal action against them, as in suicide by cop.

Whether or not exposure to suicide is a risk factor for suicide is controversial.108 A 1996 study was unable to find a relationship between suicides among friends,109 while a 1986 study found increased rates of suicide following the televisation of news stories regarding suicide.110 {{-}}
Prevention

 Suicide prevention is a term used for the collective efforts to reduce the incidence of suicide through prevention measures. Various strategies involving restricting the access to most common methods of suicide, such as firearms or toxic substances like pesticides, have proved to be effective in reducing suicide rates. Studies supported by empirical data have indicated that that adequate prevention, diagnosis and treatment of depression and alcohol and substance abuse can reduce suicide rates, as well as follow-up contact with those who have made a suicide attempt.111 While crisis hotlines are common there is little evidence to support or refute their effectiveness.112113
The Best Practices Registry (BPR) For Suicide Prevention is a registry of various suicide intervention programs maintained by the American Association of Suicide Prevention. The programs are divided, with those in Section I listing evidence-based programs: interventions which have been subjected to indepth review and for which evidence has been proven that they demonstrated positive outcomes, those in Section III are programs which have been subjected to review.114115
Screening
The U.S. Surgeon General has suggested that screening to detect those at risk of suicide may be one of the most effective means of preventing suicide in children and adolescents.116 There are various screening tools in the form of self-report questionnaires to help identify those at risk such as the Beck Hopelessness Scale and Is Path Warm?. A number of these self-report questionnaires have been tested and found to be valid for use among adolescents and young adults.117 There is however a high rate of false-positive identification and those deemed to be at risk should ideally have a follow-up interview. The predictive quality of these screening questionnaires has not been conclusively validated so it is not possible to determine if those identified at risk of suicide will actually commit suicide.118 Asking about or screening for suicide does not appear to increase the risk.119
In approximately 75% of completed suicides the individuals had seen a physician within the prior year before their death, 45%-66% within the prior month. Approximately 33% - 41% of those who completed suicide had contact with mental health services in the prior year, 20% within the prior month. These studies suggest an increased need for effective screening.120121122123124
Psychological
There are various treatments utiizing psychological treatments such as dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) in which multiple studies have reported varying degrees of clinical effectiveness from the use of DBT in reducing suicidality, including a reduction in self-harm behaviours and suicidal ideations.125126 Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CBT-SP) is a form of DBT adapted for adolescents at high risk for repeated suicide attempts.127
Epidemiology

]]
Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death worldwide129 with about a million people dying by suicide annually.130 According to 2007 data, suicides in the U.S. outnumber homicides by nearly 2 to 1 and ranks as the 11th leading cause of death in the country, ahead of liver disease and Parkinson's.131 Worldwide suicide rates have increased by 60% in the past 50 years, mainly in the developing countries.
A disproportionate amount of suicides in the world occur in Asia, which is estimated to account for up to 60% of all suicides. According to the WHO, China, India and Japan may account for 40% of all world suicides.132
In the U.S., the rate of suicide is increasing for the first time in a decade. The increase in the overall suicide rate between 1999 and 2005 has been due primarily to an increase in suicides among whites aged 40&lt;U+2013&gt;64, with white middle-aged women experiencing the largest annual increase.133
Gender


In the Western world, males die much more often by means of suicide than do females, although females attempt suicide more often. Some medical professionals believe this stems from the fact that males are more likely to end their lives through effective violent means, while women primarily use less severe methods such as overdosing on medications. In most countries, drug overdoses account for about two-thirds of suicides among women and one-third among men.134
Alcohol and drug use
In the United States 16.5% of suicides are related to alcohol.135 Alcoholics are 5 to 20 times more likely to kill themselves while the misuse of other drugs increases the risk 10 to 20 times. About 15% of alcoholics commit suicide, and about 33% of suicides in the under 35's have a primary diagnosis of alcohol or other substance misuse; over 50% of all suicides are related to alcohol or drug dependence. In adolescents alcohol or drug misuse plays a role in up to 70% of suicides.136137
Ethnicity

National suicide rates differ significantly between countries and amongst ethnic groups within countries.138 For example, in the U.S., non-Hispanic Caucasians are nearly 2.5 times more likely to kill themselves than African Americans or Hispanics.139 In the United Kingdom suicide rates vary significantly between different parts of the country. In Scotland, for example, the suicide rate is approximately double that of England.140
Social aspects
Intervention

The predominant view of modern medicine is that suicide is a mental health concern, associated with factors such as difficulty coping with depression or other mental disorders, or pressures such as inescapable suffering or fear. A suicide attempt is sometimes interpreted as a cry for help or attention, or an expression of despair and the wish to escape, rather than a genuine intent to die.141 Most people who attempt suicide do not complete suicide on a first attempt; those who later gain a history of repetitions have a significantly higher probability of eventual completion of suicide.142
In the United States, individuals who express the intent to harm themselves may be automatically determined to lack the present mental capacity to refuse treatment, and can be transported to the emergency department against their will. An emergency physician will determine whether inpatient care at a mental health care facility is warranted. This is sometimes referred to as being &quot;committed&quot;. A court hearing may be held to determine the individual's competence. In most states, a psychiatrist may hold the person for a specific time period without a judicial order. If the psychiatrist determines the person to be a threat to himself or others, the person may be admitted involuntarily to a psychiatric treatment facility. This period is usually of three days duration. After this time the person must be discharged or appear in front of a judge. As in any judicial proceeding this person has a right to legal counsel.143
Switzerland has recently taken steps to legalize assisted suicide for the chronically mentally ill. The high court in Lausanne, in a 2006 ruling, granted an anonymous individual with longstanding psychiatric difficulties the right to end his own life. At least one leading American bioethicist, Jacob Appel of Brown University, has argued that the American medical community ought to condone suicide in certain individuals with mental illness.144
Legislation

 In some jurisdictions, an act or incomplete act of suicide is considered to be a crime. More commonly, a surviving party member who assisted in the suicide attempt will face criminal charges.
In Brazil, if the help is directed to a minor, the penalty is applied in its double and not considered as homicide. In Italy and Canada, instigating another to suicide is also a criminal offense. In Singapore, assisting in the suicide of a mentally handicapped person is a capital offense. In India, abetting suicide of a minor or a mentally challenged person can result in a maximum 1 year prison term with a possible fine.145
In Germany, the following laws apply to cases of suicide:146

Active euthanasia (killing on request) is prohibited by article 216 of the StGB (Strafgesetzbuch, German Criminal Code), punishable with six months to five years in jail
German law interprets suicide as an accident and anyone present during suicide may be prosecuted for failure to render aid in an emergency. A suicide legally becomes emergency when a suicidal person loses consciousness. Failure to render aid is punishable under article 323c of the StGB, with a maximum one year jail sentence.

Religious views

In most forms of Christianity, suicide is considered a sin, based mainly on the writings of influential Christian thinkers of the Middle Ages, such as St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas; suicide was not considered a sin under the Byzantine Christian code of Justinian, for instance.147148 In Catholic doctrine, the argument is based on the commandment &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot; (made applicable under the New Covenant by Jesus in Matthew 19:18), as well as the idea that life is a gift given by God which should not be spurned, and that suicide is against the &quot;natural order&quot; and thus interferes with God's master plan for the world.149150 However, it is believed that mental illness or grave fear of suffering diminishes the responsibility of the one completing suicide.151 Counter-arguments include the following: that the sixth commandment is more accurately translated as &quot;thou shalt not murder&quot;, not necessarily applying to the self; that God has given free will to humans; that taking one's own life no more violates God's Law than does curing a disease; and that a number of suicides by followers of God are recorded in the Bible with no dire condemnation.152
Judaism focuses on the importance of valuing this life, and as such, suicide is tantamount to denying God's goodness in the world. Despite this, under extreme circumstances when there has seemed no choice but to either be killed or forced to betray their religion, Jews have committed individual suicide or mass suicide (see Masada, First French persecution of the Jews, and York Castle for examples) and as a grim reminder there is even a prayer in the Jewish liturgy for &quot;when the knife is at the throat&quot;, for those dying &quot;to sanctify God's Name&quot;. (See: Martyrdom). These acts have received mixed responses by Jewish authorities, regarded both as examples of heroic martyrdom, whilst others state that it was wrong for them to take their own lives in anticipation of martyrdom.153
Suicide is not allowed in Islam;154 however, martyring oneself for Allah (during combat) is not considered the same as completing suicide. Suicide in Islam is seen as a sign of disbelief in God.155
In Hinduism, suicide is generally frowned upon and is considered equally sinful as murdering another in contemporary Hindu society. Hindu Scriptures state that one who commits suicide will become part of the spirit world, wandering earth until the time one would have otherwise died, had one not committed suicide.156 However, Hinduism accept a man's right to end one's life through the non-violent practice of fasting to death, termed Prayopavesa.157 But Prayopavesa is strictly restricted to people who have no desire or ambition left, and no responsibilities remaining in this life.158 Jainism has a similar practice named Santhara. Sati, or self-immolation by widows was prevalent in Hindu society during the Middle Ages.
Philosophy

 Some see suicide as a legitimate matter of personal choice and a human right (colloquially known as the right to die movement), and maintain that no one should be forced to suffer against their will, particularly from conditions such as incurable disease, mental illness, and old age that have no possibility of improvement. Proponents of this view reject the belief that suicide is always irrational, arguing instead that it can be a valid last resort for those enduring major pain or trauma. This perspective is most popular in continental Europe, where euthanasia and other such topics are commonly discussed in parliament and has a good deal of support.159
A narrower segment of this group considers suicide something between a grave but condonable choice in some circumstances and a sacrosanct right for anyone (even a young and healthy person) who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives. Notable supporters of this school of thought include German pessimist philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer,160 Friedrich Nietzsche, and Scottish empiricist David Hume.161 Bioethicist Jacob Appel has become the leading advocate for this position in the United States.162163 Adherents of this view often advocate the abrogation of statutes that restrict the liberties of people known to be suicidal, such as laws permitting their involuntary commitment to mental hospitals.
Locations

Some landmarks have become known for high levels of suicide attempts. The four most popular locations in the world are reportedly San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, Toronto's Bloor Street Viaduct (before the construction of the Luminous Veil),164 Japan's Aokigahara Forest and England's Beachy Head.165 In 2005 the Golden Gate Bridge had a count exceeding 1,200 jumpers since its construction in 1937,166 in 1997 the Bloor Street Viaduct had one suicide every 22 days,167 and in 2002 Aokigahara had a record of 78 bodies found within the forest, replacing the previous record of 73 in 1998.168 The suicide rate of these places is so high that numerous signs, urging potential victims of suicide to seek help, have been posted.169
Advocacy of suicide

Advocacy of suicide has occurred in many cultures and subcultures. The Japanese military during World War II encouraged and glorified kamikaze attacks, and Japanese society as a whole has been described as suicide 'tolerant' (see Suicide in Japan).
William Francis Melchert-Dinkel, 47 years old in May 2010, from Faribault, Minnesota, a licensed nurse from 1991 until February 2009, stands accused of encouraging people to commit suicide while he watched on a webcam.170171172173
A study by the British Medical Journal found that Web searches for information on suicide are likely to return sites that encourage, and even facilitate, suicide attempts.174 There is some concern that such sites may push the suicidal over the edge.175 Some people form suicide pacts with people they meet online.176 Becker writes, &quot;Suicidal adolescent visitors risk losing their doubts and fears about committing suicide. Risk factors include peer pressure to commit suicide and appointments for joint suicides. Furthermore, some chat rooms celebrate chatters who committed suicide.&quot;177
Language
Because suicide was a crime in various countries, including in England and Wales until 1961, the word 'commit' has traditionally been used in reference to it. Organisations such as the BBC and the Samaritans have stopped using this word because of its negative connotation. 'Attempt' suicide or other phrases are preferred.178
In other species
&quot;Suicide&quot; has been observed in salmonella seeking to overcome competing bacteria by triggering an immune system response against them.179 Suicidal defences by workers are also noted in a Brazilian ant Forelius pusillus where a small group of ants leaves the security of the nest after sealing the entrance from the outside each evening.180
Pea aphids, when threatened by a ladybug, can explode themselves, scattering and protecting their brethren and sometimes even killing the lady bug.181 Some species of termites have soldiers that explode, covering their enemies with sticky goo.182183 There have been anecdotal reports of dogs, horses, and dolphins committing suicide, but with little conclusive evidence.184 There has been little scientific study of animal suicide.185
