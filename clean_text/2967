Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI) has been heavily involved in India, with one of the subsections of its Joint Intelligence Bureau department completely devoted to operations against India.1 The Joint Signal Intelligence Bureau department has been also supporting Kashmiri militants in regards to communication.2 The Joint Intelligence North section of the Joint Counter-Intelligence Bureau wing deals exclusively with India.3 In the 1950s the ISI's Covert Action Division supplied arms to insurgents in Northeast India.4&lt;ref name=&quot;South Asia Analysis Group &gt; India has also accused the ISI of reinvigorating terrorism in the country via support to the pro-Khalistan militant groups such as International Sikh Youth Federation, in order to take revenge against India for its help in liberation of Bangladesh as well as to destabilize the Indian State.56 A report by India's Intelligence Bureau indicated that ISI was &quot;desperately trying to revive Sikh&quot; militant activity in India.7 The ISI is also active in printing and supplying counterfeit Indian rupee notes.8
History
The ISI was created after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, due to Military Intelligence of Pakistan's weak performance.9 When Zia-ul-Haq seized the power in July 1977, he started his K2 (Kashmir and Khalistan) strategy, initiating the Operation Tupac.10 He gave ISI the duty to make Jammu and Kashmir a part of Pakistan, and to send the terrorists to Punjab.11 According to arrested ISI agents, the intelligence agency's aims are to confound Indian Muslims using Kashmiri Muslims; to extend the network of the ISI; to grow the framework of terrorists; to initiate 1993 Bombay bombings like attack in other cities, and to cause a state of insurgency in Muslim dominated regions.12 The ISI had set up bases in Nepal and Bangladesh, which are used for operations in North-East India.13
Operations in Jammu and Kashmir
About Rs. 2.4 crore are paid out per month by the ISI, in order to fund its activities in Jammu and Kashmir.14 Pro-Pakistani groups were reportedly favored over other militant groups.15 Creation of six militant groups in Kashmir, which included Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), was aided by the ISI.1617 According to American Intelligence officials, ISI is still providing protection and help to LeT.18 The Pakistan Army and ISI also LeT volunteers to surreptitiously penetrate from Pakistan Administrated Kashmir to Jammu and Kashmir.19 As of 2010, the degree of control that ISI retains over LeT&lt;U+2019&gt;s operations is not known.20 The LeT was also reported to have been directed by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to widen its network in the Jammu region where a considerable section of the populace comprised Punjabis.21
