Eugenio Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a de Hostos Airport  is a small public airport located three miles (5 km) north of the central business district (CBD) of Mayag&lt;U+00FC&gt;ez, Puerto Rico. The airport, named after the celebrated Mayag&lt;U+00FC&gt;ez native Eugenio Maria de Hostos, covers 172 acres and has one runway. It offers limited commercial service, subsidized by the Essential Air Service program.
History
Eugenio Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a de Hostos Airport used to be the main air gateway to the western region of Puerto Rico, until Rafael Hern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez Airport in Aguadilla took over that position.
The airport was served heavily by the Puerto Rican national air carrier, Prinair, during the 1970s and early 1980s. It took the airport three years to get commercial service again once Prinair went bankrupt in 1984. American Eagle opened service from Luis Mu&lt;U+00F1&gt;oz Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;n International Airport in 1987, and Eastern Air Lines, not to be outdone by their rival American's feeder carrier, soon began services there too, with their own feeder airline, Eastern Metro Express.
Although the airport has always been a turbo-prop aircraft airport, Pan Am announced, in 2002, intentions to install jet flights between Mayag&lt;U+00FC&gt;ez and Las Americas International Airport in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, with Boeing 727s. Those plans never became a reality, but in 2003, the airport gained international status, when Fina Air picked up the route to Santo Domingo. Fina Air has since gone out of business.
On November 8, 2004, American Eagle filed a 90-day notice of intent to the DOT to end service to Mayag&lt;U+00FC&gt;ez on February 5, 2005 due to poor loads. MAZ is an Essential Air Service market therefore American Eagle's service was extended by the DOT until the newly selected carrier, Cape Air, began operations. American Eagle ended operations on April 30, 2005.
Disasters
The airport has been involved in various air tragedies over its lifetime:

A Prinair Heron aircraft fell while landing there, killing all nine passengers.
In 1989, an American Eagle aircraft flying to San Juan from Mayag&lt;U+00FC&gt;ez also crashed, killing five passengers.
American Eagle Flight 5401, which took off from Mayag&lt;U+00FC&gt;ez, crashed at San Juan on May 9, 2004, with 17 injured, but with no fatalities.
