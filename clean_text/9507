The Canadian Council for Israel and Jewish Advocacy (CIJA) was founded in 2004 as the principal advocacy, oversight and co-ordinating body for a number of Jewish Canadian organizations including the Canada-Israel Committee (and the Quebec-Israel Committee), the Canadian Jewish Congress/United Jewish Appeal and National Jewish Campus Life. It is the advocacy arm of the United Israel Appeal in Canada.1
The CIJA's chief executive officer is Hershell Ezrin who has been in this position since the organization's inception.2
CJIA's lobbying and outreach efforts have included meetings and functions that attract high-ranking members of the Canadian government, including the prime minister, and it has financed trips to Israel for Canadian officials and thought leaders.34 The CIJA's creation has been criticized as an attempt to &quot;corporatize&quot; the funding structure of Jewish community organizations and tie them to pro-Israel advocacy.5
In April 2008, CIJA was at the center of a global controversy when Iran objected to its receiving non-governmental organization accreditation for a United Nations conference on racism; CJIA withdrew its accreditation request.6 7
