SMS LtzowSMS stands for Seiner Majestt Schiff, or His Majesty's Ship in German. was the second sclass Derfflinger battlecruiser built by the Kaiserliche Marine lang-en Imperial Navy before World War I. Ordered as a replacement for the old protected cruiser SMS Kaiserin Augusta  2, Ltzow was launched on 29 November 1913, but not completed until 1916. Ltzow was a sister ship to SMS Derfflinger  2 from which she differed slightly in that she was armed with an additional pair of 15&nbsp;cm 5.9&nbsp;inch secondary guns and had an additional watertight compartment in her hull. She was named in honor of the Prussian general Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von Ltzow who fought in the Napoleonic Wars.

Ltzow was commissioned on 8 August 1915, but did not join the I Scouting Group until 20 March due to engine damage during trials. This was after most of the major actions conducted by the German battlecruiser force had taken place. As a result, Ltzow saw very little action during the war. She took part in only one bombardment operation: the Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 23&ndash;24 April 1916, after which she became Admiral Franz von Hipper's flagship. One month later, the ship was heavily engaged during the Battle of Jutland, on 31 May&ndash;1 June. During the battle, Ltzow sank the British battlecruiser HMS Invincible 1907 6 and is sometimes given credit for the armored cruiser HMS Defence 1907 6.Gardiner and Gray, p. 154 However, she was heavily damaged by an estimated 24 heavy-caliber shell hits. With her Bow ship bow thoroughly flooded, the ship was unable to make the return voyage to German ports; her crew was evacuated and she was sunk by torpedoes fired by one of her escorts, the torpedo boat SMS G38  2.

Construction
details Derfflinger class battlecruiser

Ltzow was ordered as Ersatz Kaiserin Augusta, to replace the elderly protected cruiser SMS Kaiserin Augusta  2, which was by then 20 years old.Grner, p. 56German ships were ordered under provisional names; new additions to the fleet were given a letter designation, while those ordered as replacements for older vessels were named Ersatz ship name. Once the ship was finished, the vessel would be Ship commissioning commissioned with its intended name. For example, SMS Derfflinger was ordered as a new addition to the fleet, and so was given the provisional designation K. Ltzow's other sister, SMS Hindenburg  2, was ordered to replace the old SMS Hertha  2, and so was named Ersatz Hertha before she was formally commissioned. See: Grner, p. 56 Built by Schichau-Werft in Danzig, her keel was laid down in May 1912, and she was launched on 29 November 1913. Ltzow was commissioned on 8 August 1915 for trials, and was sent to Kiel on 23 August. There she completed her final fitting out, including her armament. While on trials on 25 October, Ltzow's port low-pressure steam turbine turbine was badly damaged. Repairs were conducted in Kiel until late January 1916, after which the ship underwent further trials. These were finished on 19 February; Ltzow was assigned to the I Scouting Group on 20 March, and arrived at her new unit four days later.Staff, p. 40

On completion she displaced nearly convert 27000 MT abbr=on and was convert 210 m ft adj=off long. The ship was capable of a top speed of convert 26.4 kn abbr=on, and could steam for convert 5600 nmi at a cruising speed of convert 14 kn abbr=on. Mounting a main armament of eight 30.5 cm SK L/50 gun 30.5&nbsp;cm 12&nbsp;in guns, Ltzow was the largest and most powerful German battlecruiser at the time, along with her elder sister SMS Derfflinger  2.Grner, pp. 56&ndash;57

Service
=Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft=
Main Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft

Ltzow' first major operation was the bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24&ndash;25&nbsp;April. Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper, the commander of the I Scouting Group, was away on sick leave, so the German ships were under the command of  Rear Admiral Friedrich Bdicker. The German battlecruisers SMS Seydlitz  2, the flagship, followed by Derfflinger, Ltzow, SMS Moltke 1910 2, and SMS Von der Tann  2 left the Jade Estuary at 10:55 on 24 April, and were supported by a screening force of 6 light cruisers and two torpedo boat flotillas. Tarrant, p. 52  The heavy units of the High Seas Fleet sailed at 13:40, with the objective to provide distant support for Bdicker's ships. The British Admiralty was made aware of the German sortie through the interception of German wireless signals, and deployed the Grand Fleet at 15:50. 

By 14:00, Bdicker's ships had reached a position off Norderney, at which point he turned his ships northward to avoid the Dutch observers on the island of Terschelling. At 15:38, Seydlitz struck a naval mine mine, which tore a convert 15 m ft adj=on long hole in her hull, just abaft of the starboard broadside torpedo tube, allowing 1,400&nbsp;short tons 1,250&nbsp;long tons of water to enter the ship. Seydlitz turned back with the screen of light cruisers at a speed of convert 15 kn km/h. The four remaining battlecruisers turned south immediately in the direction of Norderney to avoid further mine damage. By 16:00, Seydlitz was clear of imminent danger, so the ship stopped to allow Bdicker to disembark. The torpedo boat SMS V28  2 brought Bdicker to Ltzow. Tarrant, p. 53

At 04:50 on 25 April, the German battlecruisers were approaching Lowestoft when the light cruisers SMS Rostock  2 and SMS Elbing  2, which had been covering the southern flank, spotted the light cruisers and destroyers of Commodore Tyrwhitt's Harwich Force. Bdicker refused to be distracted by the British ships, and instead trained his ships' guns on Lowestoft. The German battlecruisers destroyed two 6&nbsp;in 15&nbsp;cm shore batteries and inflicted other damage to the town. In the process, a single 6&nbsp;in shell from one of the shore batteries struck Moltke, but the ship sustained no significant damage.Staff, p. 15

At 05:20, the German raiders turned north, towards Yarmouth, which they reached by 05:42. The visibility was so poor that the German ships fired one salvo each, with the exception of Derfflinger, which fired fourteen rounds from her main battery. The German ships turned back south, and at 05:47 encountered for the second time the Harwich Force, which had by then been engaged by the six light cruisers of the German screening ships. Bdicker's ships opened fire from a range of 12,000&nbsp;m 13,000&nbsp;yards.Tarrant, p. 54 Tyrwhitt immediately turned his ships around and fled south, but not before the cruiser HMS Conquest 1915 2 sustained severe damage. Due to reports of British submarines and torpedo attacks, Bdicker broke off the chase and turned back east towards the High Seas Fleet. At this point, Scheer, who had been warned of the Grand Fleet's sortie from Scapa Flow, turned back towards Germany.

Battle of Jutland
main Battle of Jutland

At 02:00 Central European Time CET,The times mentioned in this section are in Central European Time CET, which is congruent with the German perspective. This is one hour ahead of Greenwich Mean Time GMT, the time zone commonly used in British works. on 31 May 1916, the I Scouting Group departed the Jade estuary; Ltzow, Hipper's flagship, was the leading vessel, followed by her sister Derfflinger, Seydlitz, Moltke, and Von der Tann. The ships were accompanied by the II Scouting Group, under the command of Rear Admiral Bdicker, composed of the four light cruisers SMS Frankfurt  2, SMS Wiesbaden  2, SMS Pillau  2, and SMS Elbing  2. The reconnaissance force was screened by 30 torpedo boats of the II, VI, and IX Flotillas, directed by the cruiser SMS Regensburg  2.Tarrant, p. 62

An hour and a half later, the High Seas Fleet&mdash;under the command of Admiral Scheer&mdash;left the Jade with 16 dreadnoughts.SMS Knig Albert was in dock at the time. It was accompanied by the IV Scouting Group, composed of the light cruisers SMS Stettin  2, SMS Mnchen  2, SMS Hamburg  2, SMS Frauenlob  2, and SMS Stuttgart  2, and 31 torpedo boats of the I, III, V, and VII Flotillas, led by the light cruiser Rostock. The six pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron had departed from the Elbe roads at 02:45, and rendezvoused with the battle fleet at 5:00. The operation was to be a repeat of previous German fleet actions: to draw out a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it.

=Opening actions=

Shortly before 16:00, Hipper's force encountered Vice Admiral David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty Beatty's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron United Kingdom 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. At 16:00, Hipper ordered the signal Distribution of fire from left be hoisted on Ltzow.Tarrant, p. 87 The German ships were the first to open fire, at a range of approximately convert 15000 yards m.Bennett, p. 183 The two leading British battlecruisers, HMS Lion 1910 2 and HMS Princess Royal 1911 2, concentrated their fire on Ltzow.Halpern, p. 318 The British rangefinders had misread the range to their German targets, and so the first salvos fired by the British ships fell a mile beyond their German opponents. As the two lines of battlecruisers deployed to engage each other, Ltzow began to duel with her opposite in the British line, HMS Lion 1910 2.Tarrant, p. 90 By 16:51, Ltzow had hit her opponent twice, but caused no significant damage.Tarrant, p. 92 Nine minutes later, Lion scored the first hit on Ltzow; a salvo from the British ship struck the battlecruiser on her forecastle, but no major damage was done.Tarrant, p. 93 Nearly simultaneously, Ltzow dealt a tremendous blow to Lion; one of her 30.5&nbsp;cm shells penetrated the roof of Lion's center Q turret and detonated the munitions that were stored inside. Only by the resolute actions of the turret commander&mdash;Major Francis Harvey, who ordered the magazine be flooded&mdash;did the ship avoid a catastrophic magazine explosion.Tarrant, pp. 93&ndash;94Ammunition magazines on warships were equipped with seacocks that allowed the magazine to be flooded in case of a fire. By flooding the magazine, a catastrophic explosion would be averted. Indeed, approximately 30 minutes after the turret was destroyed, the fire in the turret spread to the working chamber that was directly above the magazine; there it detonated propellant charges that had been stored there. The resulting explosion would have likely destroyed the ship if the ammunition magazine had not been flooded.

At 17:03, the rearmost British battlecruiser, HMS Indefatigable 1909 2, was struck by several shells from her opponent, SMS Von der Tann  2. The forward ammunition magazines were penetrated and set on fire; the resulting explosion tore the ship apart. Shortly thereafter, Ltzow scored several more hits on Lion, though without serious damage being done. In an attempt to regroup his ships, Admiral Beatty sought to turn his ships away by 2 degrees while the sclass Queen Elizabeth battleship 2s of the 5th Battle Squadron United Kingdom 5th Battle Squadron arrived on the scene and provided covering fire. As the British battlecruisers began to turn away, Seydlitz and Derfflinger were able to concentrate their fire on Queen Mary. Witnesses reported at least 5 shells from two salvos hit the ship, which caused an intense explosion that ripped the Queen Mary in half.Tarrant, pp. 100&ndash;101 Shortly after the destruction of Queen Mary, both British and German destroyers attempted to make torpedo attacks on the opposing lines. The British destroyers Nestor and Nicator each fired two torpedoes at Ltzow, though all four missed.Tarrant, p. 104

The leading ships of the German battle fleet had by 18:00 come within effective range of the British ships, and had begun trading shots with the British battlecruisers and Queen Elizabeth-class battleships.Tarrant, p. 110 During the engagements between the combined German fleet and the British 1st Battlecruiser and 5th Battle Squadrons, Ltzow had both of her wireless transmitters damaged; after that point, the only method of communication between ships was via searchlight.Tarrant, p. 118

=Battlefleets engage=
Shortly after 19:00, the German cruiser SMS Wiesbaden  2 had become disabled by a shell from the battlecruiser HMS Invincible 1908 2; the German battlecruisers made a 16-point turn to the northeast and made for the crippled cruiser at high speed. The III Battle Squadron of the German fleet, which contained the most powerful battleships of the German navy, also altered course to assist Wiesbaden.Tarrant, p. 137 Simultaneously, the British III and IV Light Cruiser Squadrons began a torpedo attack on the German line; while advancing to torpedo range, they smothered Wiesbaden with fire from their main guns.Tarrant, pp. 138&ndash;139 During the turn to the northeast, the British destroyers HMS Onslow 1916 2 and HMS Acasta 1912 2 approached to launch torpedoes at Ltzow, though without success. Onslow was hit three times by Ltzow's secondary battery and was forced to withdraw.Campbell, pp. 116&ndash;117

At 19:15, the German battlecruisers spotted the British armored cruiser HMS Defence  2, which had joined the attack on Wiesbaden. Hipper initially hesitated, believing the ship was the German cruiser Rostock, but at 19:16, Kapitan zur See KzS Harder, Ltzow's commanding officer, ordered his ships' guns to fire. The other German battlecruisers and battleships joined in the melee; Ltzow fired five broadsides in rapid succession. In the span of less than 5 minutes, Defence was struck by several heavy-caliber shells from the German ships.Campbell, pp. 180&ndash;181 One salvo penetrated the ship's ammunition magazines and, in a massive explosion, destroyed the cruiser.Tarrant, p. 140John Campbell, in his book Jutland: An Analysis of the Fighting, writes Her sinking is usually credited to the Ltzow, though it was also claimed by the SMS Markgraf  2 and SMS Kaiser  2, and less plausibly by the SMS Kronprinz 1914 2. The SMS Groer Kurfrst 1913 Grosser Kurfrst noted that both of her 12in salvoes at the Defence hit at short range, but did not claim credit for her destruction. See page 181

Image:InvincibleBlowingUpJutland1916.jpg thumb left Invincible explodes alt=A ball of flame engulfs a large gray warship. Several smaller ships are seen in the distance.
By 19:24, the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron United Kingdom 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron had formed up with Beatty's remaining battlecruisers ahead of the German line. The leading British ships spotted Ltzow and Derfflinger, and began firing on them. In the span of 8 minutes, the battlecruiser HMS Invincible 1907 2 scored eight hits on Ltzow; these hits were mainly concentrated in the ship's bow and were the primary cause of the flooding that would eventually cause her to sink. In return, both Ltzow and Derfflinger concentrated their fire on Invincible, and 19:33, Ltzow's third salvo penetrated Invincible's center turret and ignited the magazine; the ship disappeared in a series of massive explosions.Tarrant, pp. 147&ndash;149

By 19:30, the High Seas Fleet, which was by that point pursuing the British battlecruisers, had not yet encountered the Grand Fleet. Scheer had been considering retiring his forces before darkness exposed his ships to torpedo boat attack.Tarrant, p. 150 He had not yet made a decision when his leading battleships encountered the main body of the Grand Fleet. This development made it impossible for Scheer to retreat, for doing so would have sacrificed the slower pre-dreadnought battleships of the II Battle Squadron. If he chose to use his dreadnoughts and battlecruisers to cover their retreat, he would have subjected his strongest ships to overwhelming British fire.Tarrant, p. 152 Instead, Scheer ordered his ships to turn 16 Boxing the compass points to starboard,A full circle has 32 points, each equal to 11.25 degrees; a 16-point turn would be a reversal of direction. which would bring the pre-dreadnoughts to the relative safety of the disengaged side of the German battle line.Tarrant, pp. 152&ndash;153

=Ltzow withdraws=
The other battlecruisers followed the move, but Ltzow had lost speed and was unable to keep up. Instead, the ship tried to withdraw to the southwest to escape the punishing British gunfire.Tarrant, pp. 155&ndash;156 By 20:00, flooding in the forward part of the ship had reached the magazine for the forward turret. The gun crew brought up as many shells and propellant charges as could be stored in the working chamber below the turret.Campbell, p. 272 Shortly before, at 19:50, Kommodore Michelson, aboard the cruiser Rostock, dispatched the torpedo boats of I Half-Flotilla to assist Ltzow. SMS G39  2 came alongside and took Hipper and his staff aboard, in order to transfer him to one of the other battlecruisers. SMS V45  2 and SMS G37  2 began laying a smoke screen between the battered ship and the British line, but at 20:15, before it was finished, Ltzow was struck in quick succession by four heavy-caliber shells. One pierced the ship's forward superfire superfiring gun turret turret and temporarily disabled it. The shell detonated a propellant charge and the right gun was destroyed. The second hit disabled the electric wikt:train#Verb training gear of the rearmost turret, which now had to be operated by hand.Tarrant, p. 157 Ltzow fired her last shot at 20:45, at which point the smoke screen had successfully hidden her from the British line.Tarrant, p. 159

As the German fleet began to withdraw after nightfall, Ltzow, steaming at 15&nbsp;knots,Tarrant, p. 186 attempted to pass behind the German line to seek the safety of the disengaged side.Tarrant, p. 191 By 22:13, the last German ship in the line lost sight of Ltzow, which was unable to keep up with the fleet. Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the commander of the High Seas Fleet, hoped that in the foggy darkness, Ltzow could evade detection and successfully return to a German port.Tarrant, p. 202 By 21:30, the ship was settling deeper into the sea. Water began to wash onto the deck and into the forecastle above the main armored deck; this would prove to be a significant problem.

=Ltzow scuttled=
At midnight, there was still hope that the severely wounded Ltzow could make it back to harbor. The ship was capable of 7&nbsp;knots up until around 00:45 when she began taking on more water.Campbell, p. 283 By 01:00, there was too much water in the hull for the pumps to handle. Water began to enter the forward generator compartments, which forced the crew to work by candlelight. Ltzow was so low in the water by 01:30 that water began to flood the forward boiler room.Tarrant, p. 249 By that point, almost all of the compartments in the forward part of the ship, up to the conning tower and below the main armored deck, were thoroughly flooded. Water had also entered the ship through shell holes in the forecastle above the armored deck; the majority of the the upper portion of the ship forward of the forward-most barbette was flooded as well. The battlecruiser's crew attempted to patch the shell holes three times, but as the flooding worsened and the draft increased, water increasingly washed over the deck and inhibited progress on the repair work.Campbell, p. 306 

The crew attempted to reverse direction and steam backwards, but this had to be abandoned when the bow became so submerged that the propellers were pulled partially out of the water; forward draft hull draft had increased to over 17&nbsp;meters.Normal draft was 9.2&nbsp;m forward. See: Grner, p. 56 By 2:20, an estimated 8,000&nbsp;tons of water was in the ship, and she was in serious danger of Capsize capsizing, so KzS Harder gave the order to abandon ship. The torpedo boats G37, G38, G40, and V45 came alongside the stricken battlecruiser to evacuate the ship's crew. By 02:45 Ltzow was submerged up to her bridge. G38 fired two torpedoes into the ship, and two minutes later she disappeared below the waves. The ship was approximately convert 60 km mi abbr=on north-west of Horns Reef when she was scuttled.Tarrant, p. 249 The position of the wreck is estimated to be coord 56 15 N 5 53 E.Campbell, p. 294

During the battle, Ltzow had fired an estimated 380 main battery shells and 400 rounds from her secondary guns, as well as two torpedoes.Tarrant, p. 292 In return, she was hit 24 times by British heavy-caliber shells.Tarrant, p. 296 The ship's crew suffered 115 men killed and another 50 wounded, second only to Derfflinger, which lost 157 men killed and 26 wounded.Tarrant, p. 298
