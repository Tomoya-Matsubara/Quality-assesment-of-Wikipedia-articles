The Carm&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E8&gt;re grape is a wine grape variety originally planted in the M&lt;U+00E9&gt;doc region of Bordeaux, France where it was used to produce deep red wines and occasionally used for blending purposes in the same manner as Petit Verdot. A member of the Cabernet family of grapes, the name &quot;Carm&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E8&gt;re&quot; originates from the French word for crimson (carmin) after the hue of the grape in fall. 1 The grape is also known as Grand Vidure, a historic Bordeaux synonym, although current European Union regulations prohibit Chilean imports under this name into the EU. 2  Rarely found in France today, the world's largest area planted with this variety is in Chile in South America, with more than 4,000 Hectares (2006) cultivated in the Central Valley. It is also found in Italy's Eastern Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia regions. 3
Origin
The Carmen&lt;U+00E8&gt;re grape originated in the M&lt;U+00E9&gt;doc region of Bordeaux, France and was also widely planted in the Graves until the vines were struck with oidium. 4 It is almost impossible to find Carm&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E8&gt;re wines in France today, as a Phylloxera plague in 1867 nearly destroyed all the vineyards of Europe, afflicting the Carm&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E8&gt;re grapevines in particular such that for many years the grape was presumed extinct. When the vineyards were replanted, growers could not replant Carm&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E8&gt;re as it was extremely hard to find and more difficult to grow than other grape varieties common to Bordeaux. The region's damp, chilly spring weather gave rise to coulure, &quot;a condition endemic to certain vines in climates which have marginal, sometimes cool, wet springs&quot;,5 which prevented the vine's buds from flowering. Yields were lower than other varieties and the crops were rarely healthy; consequently wine growers chose more versatile and less coulure-susceptible grapes when re-planting the vines.
Growth in Chile
Fortunately, this grapevine variety had been exported to Chile in 1850, where wine growers modeled the wineries after those in France. Thus in the 1850s cuttings from Bordeaux, which included Carm&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E8&gt;re grape, were planted in the valleys around Santiago, Chile. 6 During most of the 20th century, Chilean growers beleived the Carmen&lt;U+00E8&gt;re to be Merlot and it was inadvertently collected and processed together with Merlot grapes (probably reaching up to 50% of the total volume) giving Chilean Merlots an inexplicably rich and superior quality. In 1994, Professor Jean-Michel Bousiquot from the Montpellier's school of Oenology confirmed that it was Bordeaux Carm&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E8&gt;re, not Merlot. 7Today Carmen&lt;U+00E8&gt;re grows chiefly in the Rapel Valley and Maipo Province.8
Further genetic research has shown that the variety may be distantly related to Merlot. It is claimed by some that the variety name is an alias for what is actually the Vidure, a local Bordeaux name for a Cabernet Sauvignon clone once thought to be the grape from which all red Bordeaux varieties originated. Another theory holds that the true name should be Biturica, thought to be an ancient variety that originated from Iberia (modern-day Spain and Portugal) as claimed by Pliny the Elder; indeed, it is currently a popular blending variety with Sangiovese in Tuscany called &quot;Predicato di Biturica&quot;. As the Chilean wine industry grows, more experimentation is being carried out on Carmen&lt;U+00E8&gt;re's potential as a blending grape, especially with Cabernet Sauvignon. 9
Chile's minimal rainfall during the growing season allows for healthier crops of Carmen&lt;U+00E8&gt;re and there has been no spread of phylloxera thanks to the protection of the country's natural boundaries. Although wines are produced closely following the French model, attempts by French growers to bring back and re-adapt Carm&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E8&gt;re vines from Chile after 1994 have not yielded good enough results and to date have been abandoned.
Carmen&lt;U+00E8&gt;re &amp; Merlot
 The similarities in appearance have linked the two vines for centuries and their cuttings were imported together from 19th century Bordeaux. Despite the similarities, there are some noticeable differences that aid the ampelographer in identifying the two vines. When young, Carmen&lt;U+00E8&gt;re leaves have a reddish hue underneath, while the leaves of Merlot are white. There are also slight differences in leaf shape with the central lobe of Merlot leaves being longer. 10
Merlot ripens three weeks earlier then Carmen&lt;U+00E8&gt;re. In cases were the vineyards are inter-dispersed with both varieties, the time of harvest is paramount in determining the character of the resulting blends. If Merlot grapes are picked when Carmen&lt;U+00E8&gt;re is fully ripe, they will be overripe and impart a &quot;jammy&quot; character. If the grapes are picked earlier when only the Merlot grapes have reached ripeness, the Carmen&lt;U+00E8&gt;re will have an aggressive green pepper flavor. 11 
Concha y Toro, a Chilean winery, has 100 hectares planted from a Carmen&lt;U+00E8&gt;re clone and produces a varietal that is aged in both French and American white oak barrels for at least 3 &lt;U+2013&gt; 4 years before release.12
Viticulture
Carmen&lt;U+00E8&gt;re favors a long growing season in moderate to warm climates. During harvest time and the winter period the vine fares poorly if it is introduced to high levels of rain or irrigation water. This is particularly true in poor soil plantings where the vine would need more water. The influence of water during this period accentuates the herbaceous and green pepper characteristics of the grape. The grape naturally develops high levels of sugar before the tannins achieve ripeness. If grown in too hot a climate the resulting wine will have a high alcohol level and low balance. 13
