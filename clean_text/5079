The Arapaho language or Arapaho proper (also spelled &quot;Arapahoe&quot;; in Arapaho: Hin&lt;U+00F3&gt;no&lt;U+2019&gt;eit&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt;t ) is a one of the Plains Algonquian languages, closely related to Gros Ventre and other Arapahoan languages. It is spoken by under 300 people over age 50 in Wyoming, and in Oklahoma by &quot;only a handful of people . . . all near eighty or older&quot;. As such, it is in danger of becoming extinct. As of 1996, there were approximately 1,000 speakers among the Northern Arapaho. As of 2008, the authors of a newly published grammar estimated there were slightly over 250 fluent speakers, plus &quot;quite a few near-fluent passive understanders&quot;. In 2008, it was reported that a school had been opened to teach the language to children.
Dialects
Besawunena, only attested from a wordlist collected by Kroeber, differs only slightly from Arapaho, though a few of its sound changes resemble those seen in Gros Ventre. It had speakers among the Northern Arapaho as recently as the late 1920s.
Phonology
Among the sound changes in the evolution from Proto-Algonquian to Arapaho are the loss of Proto-Algonquian *k, followed by *p becoming either  or ; the two Proto-Algonquian semivowels merging to either  or ; and *m often becoming . Arapaho is unusual among Algonquian languages in retaining the contrast between the reconstructed phonemes *r and *&lt;U+03B8&gt; (generally as  and , respectively). These and other changes serve to give Arapaho a phonological system very divergent from that of Proto-Algonquian and other Algonquian languages, and even from languages spoken in the adjacent Great Basin. Some examples comparing Arapaho words with their cognates in Proto-Algonquian can illustrate this:

Vowels
Almost uniquely among the world's languages, it has no low vowels, such as .
At the level of pronunciation, Arapaho words cannot begin with a vowel, so where the underlying form of a word begins with a vowel, a prothetic  is added.
Arapaho has a series of four short vowels  (pronounced ) and four long vowels  (customarily written &lt;U+27E8&gt;ii ee oo uu&lt;U+27E9&gt; and pronounced ). The difference in length is phonemically distinctive: compare h&lt;U+00ED&gt;si&lt;U+2019&gt;, &quot;tick&quot; with h&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt;si&lt;U+2019&gt;, &quot;day&quot;, and h&lt;U+00F3&gt;coo, &quot;steak&quot; with h&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;coo, &quot;devil&quot;.  and  are mostly in complementary distribution, as, with very few exceptions, the former does not occur after velar consonants, and the latter only occurs after them.  does have some exceptions as in the free variants kok&lt;U+00ED&gt;y ~ kok&lt;U+00FA&gt;y, &quot;gun&quot;; kookiy&lt;U+00F3&gt;n ~ kookuy&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, &quot;for no reason&quot;; and b&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;ox&lt;U+00ED&gt;yoo ~ b&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;ox&lt;U+00FA&gt;yoo, &quot;Found in the Grass&quot; (a mythological character). There is only one minimal pair to illustrate the contrast in distribution: n&lt;U+00FA&gt;hu&lt;U+2019&gt;, &quot;this&quot; versus n&lt;U+00ED&gt;hi&lt;U+2019&gt;-, &quot;X was done with Y&quot;, in which n&lt;U+00ED&gt;hi&lt;U+2019&gt;- only occurs in bound form.
There are four diphthongs, , and several triphthongs,  as well as extended sequences of vowels such as  with stress on either the first or the last vowel in the combination.

Allophony
The phoneme /b/ (the voiced bilabial stop) has a voiceless allophone [p] that occurs before other consonants or at the end of a word. The plosives , /k/, and /t/ are pronounced without aspiration in most environments, but are aspirated before other consonants or at the end of a word, or when preceding a syllable-final sequence of short vowel + /h/. In this same environment /b/ is aspirated and devoiced. For example, the grammatical prefix cih- is pronounced , the grammatical prefix tih- is pronounced , and the word h&lt;U+00E9&gt;&lt;U+00E9&gt;tbih&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt;nk&lt;U+00FA&gt;&lt;U+00FA&gt;tiinoo, &quot;I will turn out the lights&quot; is hetih&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt;nk&lt;U+00FA&gt;&lt;U+00FA&gt;tiinoo.
Consonant clusters
Consonant clusters in Arapaho can only be two consonants long. Consonant clusters do not occur word initially, and /hC/ is the only that occurs word finally. The only consonant cluster that is &quot;base generated&quot; (exists in the most underlying representation of words) is /hC/. At the &quot;surface&quot; (at the level of actual pronunciation), other clusters arise by phonological processes including vowel syncope, or by juxtaposition of morphemes.
Prosody
Arapaho is a pitch-accent language. There are two phonemic tones: high (marked with an acute accent) or &quot;normal&quot; (unmarked). The contrast can be illustrated with the pair h&lt;U+00F3&gt;noos&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;, &quot;it is fancy&quot; and honoos&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;, &quot;it is raining.&quot; Long vowels and vowel sequences can carry a contour tone from high to low, as in hou3&lt;U+00ED&gt;ne-, &quot;to hang&quot; (where the first syllable has a normal tone) versus h&lt;U+00F3&gt;u3&lt;U+00ED&gt;ne-, &quot;to float&quot; (where the first syllable has a high+normal, or falling, tone). Although tonal contrasts are distinctive in Arapaho, minimal pairs such as those listed above are rare.
