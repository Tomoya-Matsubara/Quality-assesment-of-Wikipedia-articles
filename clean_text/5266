The United Church of Christ (UCC) is a mainline Protestant Christian denomination primarily in the Reformed tradition but also historically influenced by Lutheranism.12 The Evangelical and Reformed Church and the Congregational Christian Churches united in 1957 to form the UCC. These two denominations, which were themselves the result of earlier unions, had their roots in Congregational, Evangelical, and Reformed denominations. The UCC's 5,287 congregations claim 1,080,199 members, primarily in the United States.3
The UCC maintains full communion with other mainline Protestant denominations, while many congregations choose to practice open communion.4 The denomination places high emphasis on participation in worldwide interfaith and ecumenical efforts.56 The national settings of the UCC have historically favored liberal views on social issues, such as civil rights, gay rights, women's rights and abortion rights. However, United Church of Christ congregations are independent in matters of doctrine and ministry and may not necessarily support the national body's theological or moral stances. It is self-described as &quot;an extremely pluralistic and diverse denomination&quot;.7
History


The United Church of Christ was formed when two Protestant churches, the Evangelical and Reformed Church and the Congregational Christian Churches united in 1957.89 This union adopted an earlier general statement of unity between the two denominations, the 1943 &quot;Basis of Union&quot;.10 At this time, the UCC claimed about two million members.11 In 1959, in its General Synod, the UCC adopted a broad &quot;Statement of Faith&quot;.12 The UCC adopted its constitution and by-laws in 1961.13
Beliefs
There is no UCC hierarchy or body that can impose any doctrine or worship format onto the individual congregations within the UCC.14 While individual congregations are supposed to hold guidance from the general synod &quot;in the highest regard&quot;, the UCC's constitution requires that the &quot;autonomy of the Local Church is inherent and modifiable only by its own action&quot;.15
Within this locally-focused structure, however, there are central beliefs common to the UCC. The UCC often uses four words to describe itself: &quot;Christian, Reformed, Congregational and Evangelical&quot;.16 While the UCC refers to its evangelical characteristics, it springs from (and is considered part of) mainline Protestantism as opposed to Evangelicalism. The UCC is generally theologically liberal, and the denomination notes that the &quot;Bible, though written in specific historical times and places, still speaks to us in our present condition&quot;.17
The motto of the United Church of Christ comes from John 17:21: &quot;That they may all be one&quot;. The denomination's official literature uses broad doctrinal parameters, emphasizing freedom of individual conscience and local church autonomy.
Historic confessions
In the United Church of Christ, creeds, confessions, and affirmations of faith function as &quot;testimonies of faith&quot; around which the church gathers rather than as &quot;tests of faith&quot; rigidly prescribing required doctrinal consent. As expressed in the United Church of Christ constitution:

The United Church of Christ acknowledges as its sole Head, Jesus Christ, Son of God and Savior. It acknowledges as kindred in Christ all who share in this confession. It looks to the Word of God in the Scriptures, and to the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, to prosper its creative and redemptive work in the world. It claims as its own the faith of the historic Church expressed in the ancient creeds and reclaimed in the basic insights of the Protestant Reformers. It affirms the responsibility of the Church in each generation to make this faith its own in reality of worship, in honesty of thought and expression, and in purity of heart before God. In accordance with the teaching of our Lord and the practice prevailing among evangelical Christians, it recognizes two sacraments: Baptism and the Lord's Supper or Holy Communion.18

The denomination, therefore, looks to a number of historic confessions as expressing the common faith around which the church gathers, including:

The Apostles' Creed,
The Nicene Creed,
The Heidelberg Catechism (inherited from both the German Reformed and German Evangelical heritages),
Luther's Small Catechism (inherited from the German Evangelical heritage),
The Kansas City Statement of Faith (a 1913 statement in the Congregationalist tradition),
The Evangelical Catechism (a 1927 catechism in the German Evangelical tradition), and
The Statement of Faith of the United Church of Christ (written at the founding of the denomination).

Studies and surveys of beliefs
In 2001, Hartford Institute for Religion Research did a &quot;Faith Communities Today&quot; (FACT) study19 that included a survey of United Church of Christ beliefs. Among the results of this were findings that in the UCC, 5.6% of the churches responding to the survey described their members as &quot;very liberal or progressive,&quot; 3.4% as &quot;very conservative,&quot; 22.4% as &quot;somewhat liberal or progressive,&quot; and 23.6% as &quot;somewhat conservative.&quot; Those results suggested a nearly equal balance between liberal and conservative congregations. The self-described &quot;moderate&quot; group, however, was the largest at 45%. Other statistics found by the Hartford Institute show that 53.2% of members say &quot;the Bible&quot; is the highest source of authority, 16.1% say the &quot;Holy Spirit,&quot; 9.2% say &quot;Reason,&quot; 6.3% say &quot;Experience,&quot; and 6.1% say &quot;Creeds.&quot;
David Roozen, director of the Hartford Institute for Religion Research who has studied the United Church of Christ, said surveys show the national church's pronouncements are often more liberal than the views in the pews but that its governing structure is set up to allow such disagreements.20 Starting in 2003, a task force commissioned by General Synod 24 studied the diverse worship habits of UCC churches. The study can be found online21 and reflects statistics on attitudes toward worship, baptism, and communion, such as &quot;Laity (70%) and clergy (90%) alike overwhelmingly describe worship 'as an encounter with God that leads to doing God&lt;U+2019&gt;s work in the world.'&quot; &quot;95 percent of our congregations use the Revised Common Lectionary in some way in planning or actual worship and preaching&quot; and &quot;96 percent always or almost always have a sermon, 86 percent have a time with children, 95 percent have a time of sharing joys and concerns, and 98 percent include the Prayer of Our Savior/Lord&lt;U+2019&gt;s Prayer.&quot; Clergy and laity were invited to select two meanings of baptism that they emphasize. They were also to suggest the meaning that they thought their entire church emphasized. Baptism as an &lt;U+201C&gt;entry into the Church Universal&lt;U+201D&gt; was the most frequent response. Clergy and laity were invited to identify two meanings of Holy Communion that they emphasize. While clergy emphasized Holy Communion as &lt;U+201C&gt;a meal in which we encounter God&lt;U+2019&gt;s living presence,&lt;U+201D&gt; laity emphasized &lt;U+201C&gt;a remembrance of Jesus&lt;U+2019&gt; last supper, death, and resurrection.&lt;U+201D&gt;
Relationships with other denominations
One of the UCC's central beliefs is that it is &quot;called to be a united and uniting church.&quot;22 Because of this, the UCC is involved in Churches Uniting in Christ, an organization seeking to establish full communion among nine Protestant denominations in America.23 Currently, however, the UCC has entered into a partnership with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and is in full communion with the ELCA, Presbyterian Church (USA), The United Methodist Church and the Reformed Church in America.24
In 1982 the World Council of Churches published &quot;Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry&quot;,25 a document that has served as a foundation for many ecumenical recognition agreements. As a WCC member church, the United Church of Christ issued a response as part of the process to work toward a statement of common theological perspectives.26
Relationships with other religions
The United Church of Christ facilitates bilateral dialogues with many faith groups, including members of the Jewish and Muslim communities. This includes membership in the National Muslim-Christian Initiative.27
Structure
Quoting the United Church of Christ Constitution, &quot;The basic unit of the life and organization of the United Church of Christ is the local church.&quot; An interplay of wider interdependence with local autonomy characterizes the organization of the UCC. Each &quot;setting&quot; of the United Church of Christ relates covenantally with other settings, their actions speaking &quot;to but not for&quot; each other.
The ethos of United Church of Christ organization is considered &quot;covenantal.&quot; The structure of UCC organization is a mixture of the congregational and presbyterian polities of its predecessor denominations. With ultimate authority on most matters given to the local church, many see United Church of Christ polity as closer to congregationalism; however, with ordination and pastoral oversight conducted by Associations, and General Synod representation given to Conferences instead of congregational delegates, certain presbyterian similarities are also visible.
Local churches
 The basic unit of the United Church of Christ is the local church (also often called the congregation). Local churches have the freedom to govern themselves, establishing their own internal organizational structures and theological positions. Thus, local church governance varies widely throughout the denomination. Some congregations, mainly of Congregational or Christian origin, have numerous relatively-independent &quot;boards&quot; that oversee different aspects of church life, with annual or more frequent meetings (often conducted after a worship service on a Sunday afternoon) of the entire congregation to elect officers, approve budgets and set congregational policy. Other churches, mainly of Evangelical and Reformed descent, have one central &quot;church council&quot; or &quot;consistory&quot; that handles most or all affairs in a manner somewhat akin to a Presbyterian session, while still holding an annual congregational meeting for the purpose of electing officers and/or ratifying annual budgets. Still others, probably those congregations started after the 1957 merger, have structures incorporating aspects of both, or other alternative organizational structures entirely.
In almost all cases, though, the selection of a minister for the congregation is, in keeping with the Reformed tradition of the &quot;priesthood of all believers,&quot; vested in a congregational meeting, held usually after a special ad hoc committee searches on the congregation's behalf for a candidate. Members of the congregation vote for or against the committee's recommended candidate for the pastorate, usually immediately after the candidate has preached a &quot;trial sermon;&quot; candidates are usually presented one at a time and not as a field of several to be selected from. Typically the candidate must secure anywhere from 60 to 90 percent affirmative votes from the membership before the congregation issues a formal call to the candidate; this depends on the provisions in the congregation's particular constitution and/or by-laws. Local churches have, in addition to the freedom to hire ministers and lay staff, the sole power to dismiss them also. However, unlike purely congregational polities, the association has the main authority to ordain clergy and grant standing to clergy coming to a church from another association or another denomination (this authority is exercised &quot;in cooperation with&quot; the person being ordained/called and the local church that is calling them). Such standing, among other things, permits a minister to participate in the UCC clergy pension and insurance plans. Local churches are usually aided in searching for and calling ordained clergy through a denominationally-coordinated &quot;search-and-call&quot; system, usually facilitated by staff at the conference level. However, the local church may, for various reasons, opt not to avail itself of the conference placement system, and is free to do so without fear of retaliation, which would likely occur in synodical or presbyterian polities. Participation in the process, though, is usually a sign of the congregation's loyalty to the larger denomination and its work.
At the end of 2008, 5,320 churches were reported to be within the UCC, averaging 210 members. Sixteen churches were reported to have over 2,000 members, but 64% had fewer than 200 members.28 The latter statistic probably indicates where most of the denomination's declining membership has occurred, in formerly mid-sized congregations between 200 and 500 members or so. The reduction in a typical church's size has also meant that, increasingly, many congregations are no longer able, as they once were, to afford a full-time, seminary-educated pastor, and that some of them have to rely on alternatives such as one of their members serving the church under a license, the use of recently retired clergy on a short-term basis, or ordained ministers serving the church on a half-time (or less) basis while earning their primary income from chaplaincies or other occupations. While this has been occurring to a lesser degree in other mainline denominations as well, the UCC's congregational polity allows for churches to adopt such approaches without ecclesiological restraint, as would happen in a more hierarchical denominational structure.
Larger organizations
Associations

Local churches are typically gathered together in regional bodies called Associations. Local churches often give financial support to the association to support its activities. The official delegates of an association are all ordained clergy within the bounds of the association together with lay delegates sent from each local church. The association's main ecclesiastical function is to provide primary oversight and authorization of ordained and other authorized ministers; it also is the ecclesiastical link between the local congregation and the larger UCC. The association ordains new ministers, holds ministers' standing in covenant with local churches, and is responsible for disciplinary action; typically a specific ministerial committee handles these duties. Also, an association, again with the assistance of the ministerial committee, admits and removes local congregations from membership in the UCC.
Associations meet at least once annually to elect officers and board members and set budgets for the association's work; fellowship and informational workshops are often conducted during those meetings, which may take place more frequently according to local custom. In a few instances where there is only one association within a conference, or where the associations within a conference have agreed to dissolve, the Conference (below) assumes the association's functions.
Conferences

Local churches also are members of larger Conferences, of which there are 38 in the United Church of Christ. A conference typically contains multiple associations; if no associations exist within its boundaries, the conference exercises the functions of the association as well. Conferences are supported financially through local churches' contribution to &quot;Our Church's Wider Mission&quot; (formerly &quot;Our Christian World Mission&quot;), the United Church of Christ's denominational support system; unlike most associations, they usually have permanent headquarters and professional staff. The primary ecclesiastical function of a conference is to provide the primary support for the search-and-call process by which churches select ordained leadership; the conference minister and/or his or her associates perform this task in coordination with the congregation's pulpit search committee (see above) and the association to which the congregation belongs (particularly its ministerial committee). Conferences also provide significant programming resources for their constituent churches, such as Christian education resources and support, interpretation of the larger UCC's mission work, and church extension within their bounds (the latter usually conducted in conjunction with the national Local Church Ministries division).
Conferences, like associations, are congregationally representative bodies, with each local church sending ordained and lay delegates. Most current UCC conferences were formed in the several years following the consummation of the national merger in 1961, and in some instances were the unions of former Congregational Christian conferences (led by superintendents) and Evangelical and Reformed synods (led by presidents, some of whom served only on a part-time basis). A few have had territorial adjustments since then; only one conference, the Calvin Synod, composed of Hungarian-heritage Reformed congregations, received exemption from the geographical alignments, with its churches scattered from Connecticut westward to California and southward to Florida. Only one conference has ever withdrawn completely from the denomination: Puerto Rico, expressing disapproval of national UCC tolerance of homosexuality (as well as that of a large number of mainland congregations), departed the denomination in 2006, taking all of its churches.
General Synod

The denomination's churchwide deliberative body is the General Synod, which meets every two years. The General Synod consists of delegates elected from the Conferences (distributed proportionally by conference size) together with the boards of directors of each of the four covenanted ministries (see below, under National Offices).
While General Synod provides the most visible voice of the &quot;stance of the denomination&quot; on any particular issue, the covenantal polity of the denomination means that General Synod speaks to local churches, associations, and conferences, but not for them. Thus, the other settings of the church are allowed to hold differing views and practices on all non-constitutional matters.
General Synod considers three kinds of resolutions:

Pronouncements: A Pronouncement is a statement of Christian conviction on a matter of moral or social principle and has been adopted by a two-thirds vote of a General Synod.
Proposals for Action: A Proposal for Action is a recommendation for specific directional statements and goals implementing a Pronouncement. A Proposal for Action normally accompanies a Pronouncement. (See link above regarding Pronouncements.)
Resolutions and Other Formal Motions Which may consist of the following three types:

Resolutions of Witness: A Resolution of Witness is an expression of the General Synod concerning a moral, ethical, or religious matter confronting the church, the nation, or the world, adopted for the guidance of the officers, Associated, or Affiliated Ministries, or other bodies as defined in Article VI of the Bylaws of the United Church of Christ; the consideration of local churches, Associations, Conferences, and other bodies related to the United Church of Christ; and for a Christian witness to the world. It represents agreement by at least two-thirds of the delegates voting that the view expressed is based on Christian conviction and is a part of their witness to Jesus Christ.
Prudential Resolutions: A Prudential Resolution establishes policy, institutes or revises structure or procedures, authorizes programs, approves directions, or requests actions by a majority vote.
Other Formal Motions


National offices: covenanted, affiliated, and associated ministries
As agents of the General Synod, the denomination maintains national offices comprising four &quot;covenanted ministries&quot;, one &quot;associated ministry&quot;, and one &quot;affiliated ministry&quot;. The current system of national governance was adopted in 1999 as a restructure of the national setting, consolidating numerous agencies, boards, and &quot;instrumentalities&quot; that the UCC, in the main, had inherited from the Congregational Christian Churches at the time of merger, along with several created during the denomination's earlier years.
Covenanted ministries
These structures carry out the work of the General Synod and support the local churches, associations, and conferences. The head executives of these ministries comprise the five member Collegium of Officers, which are the non-hierarchical official officers of the denomination. (The Office of General Ministries is represented by both the General Minister, who serves as President of the denomination, and the Associate General minister). According the UCC office of communication press release at the time of restructure, &quot;In the new executive arrangement, the five will work together in a Collegium of Officers, meeting as peers. This setting is designed to provide an opportunity for mutual responsibility and reporting, as well as ongoing assessment of UCC programs.&quot; The main offices of the Covenanted ministries are at the &quot;Church House&quot;, the United Church of Christ national headquarters at 700 Prospect Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio.

The Office of General Ministries (OGM) is responsible for administration, common services (technology, physical plant, etc.), covenantal relations (ecumenical relations, formal relations to other settings of the church), financial development, and &quot;proclamation, identity and communication&quot;. The current General Minister and President is the Rev. Dr. Geoffrey Black and the current Associate General Minister is Mr. W. Mark Clark.
Local Church Ministries (LCM) is responsible for evangelism, stewardship and church finance, worship and education, Pilgrim Press and United Church Resources (the publishing house of the United Church of Christ), and parish life and leadership (authorization, clergy development, seminary relations, parish leadership, etc.). The current Executive Minister of Local Church Ministries is the Rev. J. Bennett Guess.
Wider Church Ministries (WCM) is responsible for partner relations* (relations with churches around the world, missionary work, etc.), local church relations* (as relates to world ministries and missions), global sharing of resources, health and wholeness ministry, and global education and advocacy*. The starred '*' ministries are carried out through the Common Global Ministries Board, a joint instrumentality of the United Church of Christ and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), based in Indianapolis, Indiana. The current Executive Minister for Wider Church Ministries is the Rev. Rev. Jim Moos.
Justice and Witness Ministries (JWM) is responsible for ministries related to economic justice, human rights, justice for women and transformation, public life and social policy, and racial justice. In addition to its offices in Cleveland, JWM also maintains an office on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. The current Executive Minister for Justice and Witness Ministries is Rev. M. Linda Jaramillo. JWM also maintains an office called &quot;Minister for Children, Families and Human Sexuality Advocacy&quot; that promotes the Our Whole Lives sex education curriculum.

Affiliated ministry
The Pension Boards of the United Church of Christ (PB-UCC) operates the employee benefits systems for all settings of the United Church of Christ, including health, dental, and optical insurance, retirement annuity/pension systems, disability and life insurance, and ministerial assistance programs. The Pension Boards offices are located in New York City, where the headquarters of all UCC national bodies had been located prior to their move to Ohio in the early 1990s.
Associated ministry
United Church Funds (UCF), formerly known as The United Church Foundation, provides low cost, socially responsible, professionally managed Common Investment Funds (CIFs) and other trustee services to any setting of the United Church of Christ. United Church Funds' offices are also located in New York City.
Other related ministry
The Insurance Board is a nonprofit corporation collectively &quot;owned&quot; by the Conferences of the United Church of Christ. It is run by a president/CEO and a 19-member Board, with the full corporate board consisting of participating Conference ministers. The IB administers a property insurance, liability insurance, and risk management program serving the United Church of Christ, the Presbyterian Church USA, and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) churches and related entities.29
Activities
Social activism
The UCC national body has been active in numerous traditionally-liberal social causes, including support for abortion rights,30 the United Farm Workers, and the Wilmington Ten.31
Same-sex marriage
Churches in the UCC can sanctify same-sex unions.32 The resolution &quot;In support of equal marriage rights for all&quot;, supported by an estimated 80% of the UCC's 2005 general synod delegates, made the United Church of Christ the first major Christian deliberative body in the U.S. to make a statement of support for &quot;equal marriage rights for all people, regardless of gender,&quot; and is hitherto the largest Christian denominational entity in the U.S. supporting same-sex marriage.33 This resolution (and the sanctification of same-sex marriages), however, is not supported by some congregations.34 Of particular note, the Iglesia Evangelica Unida de Puerto Rico, a long-standing congregation in the UCC, voted by a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1 margin to withdraw its affiliation with the UCC over the same-sex marriage issue.35
Apology Resolution
United Church of Christ was recognized in the Apology Resolution to Native Hawaiians. In the Resolution, Congress recognized the reconciliation made by the UCC in the Eighteenth General Synod for their actions in overthrowing the Kingdom of Hawaii.
Statement on the relationship between Israel and Palestinians


United Church of Christ General Synod XXV also passed two resolutions concerning the conflict between Israel and Palestinians in the Middle East. One calls for the use of economic leverage to promote peace in the Middle East, which can include measures such as government lobbying, selective investment, shareholder lobbying, and selective divestment from companies which profit from the continuing Israel-Palestine conflict. The other resolution, named &quot;Tear Down the Wall&quot;, calls upon Israel to remove the separation barrier between Israel and the West Bank. Opponents of the &quot;Tear Down the Wall&quot; resolution have noted that the wall's purpose is to prevent terrorist attacks, and that the resolution does not call for a stop to these attacks. The Simon Wiesenthal Center stated that the July 2005 UCC resolutions on divestment from Israel were &quot;functionally anti-Semitic&quot;.36 The Anti-Defamation League stated that those same resolutions are &quot;disappointing and disturbing&quot; and &quot;deeply troubling&quot;.37 In addition to the concerns raised about the merits of the &quot;economic leverage&quot; resolution, additional concerns were raised about the process in which the General Synod approved the resolution. Michael Downs of the United Church of Christ Pension Boards (who would be charged with implementing any divestment of the UCC's Pension Board investments) wrote a letter38 to UCC President John H. Thomas expressing concern &quot;with the precedent-setting implications of voted actions, integrity of process and trust.&quot;
Sex Education
The United Church of Christ, along with the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations created several sexual education classes designed for many different age groups. Called Our Whole Lives, or OWL, these courses aim to provide scientific and unbiased information regarding sexuality, birth control and condoms, and physical biology.

&quot;God Is Still Speaking&quot; banner on a UCC church in Rochester, Minnesota.

&quot;God Is Still Speaking,&quot; identity campaign
At the 2003 General Synod, the United Church of Christ began a campaign with &quot;emphasis on expanding the UCC's name-brand identity through modern advertising and marketing.&quot;39 that was formally launched Advent 2004. The campaign included coordinated program of evangelism and hospitality training for congregations paired with national and local television &quot;brand&quot; advertising, known as the &quot;God is Still Speaking&quot; campaign or &quot;The Stillspeaking Initiative.&quot; The initiative was themed around the quotation &quot;Never place a period where God has placed a comma,&quot; and campaign materials, including print and broadcast advertising as well as merchandise, featured the quote and a large &quot;comma,&quot; with a visual theme in red and black. United Church of Christ congregations were asked to &quot;opt in&quot; to the campaign, signifying their support as well as their willingness to receive training on hospitality and evangelism. An evangelism event was held in Atlanta in August 2005 to promote the campaign.40 Several renewal groups panned the ad campaign for its efforts to create an ONA/progressive perception of the UCC identity despite its actual majority in centrist/moderate viewpoints.4142 According to John Evans, associate professor of sociology at University of California, San Diego, &quot;The UCC is clearly going after a certain niche in American society who are very progressive and have a particular religious vision that includes inclusiveness... They are becoming the religious brand that is known for this.&quot;43
Criticism
The church's diversity and adherence to covenantal polity (rather than government by regional elders or bishops) give individual congregations a great deal of freedom in the areas of worship, congregational life, and doctrine. Nonetheless, some critics, mainly social and theological conservatives, are vocal about the UCC's theology, political identity, and cultural milieu.
Theological criticism
More conservative members of the UCC have complained that the UCC has lost members because of its &quot;theological surrender to the moral and spiritual confusion of contemporary culture.&quot;44 This movement has focused its complaints on the &quot;often radically liberal political agenda&quot; of the UCC.45
Social criticism
Conservatives have complained that UCC members are &quot;probably the most left-leaning of all major U.S. denominations.&quot;46 These critics have complained that the UCC attempts to control &quot;how liberal Christians should think in politically correct terms about climate controversies, socialized medicine, the U.S. presence in Iraq, immigration and the Welfare State.&quot;47
Criticism over same-sex marriage
The UCC has been severely criticized for its stand on same-sex marriage. In fact, citing differences over &quot;the membership and ministry of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Christians&quot;, the UCC's Puerto Rico Conference left the church in 2006.48
Criticism of sex education
Critics have complained that the UCC's focus on sex education, including the distribution of condoms, does not provide appropriate moral context for sex and has failed in &quot;reinforcing the traditional Christian ethic reserving sex for marriage.&quot;49
Sources of criticism
The Institute on Religion and Democracy has been consistently critical of the UCC, complaining that the denomination &quot;is stuck in the liberal theology and politics of the 1960s&quot; and makes conservatives feel unwelcome.50
Internal critics have also complained that the UCC has &quot;set on a course of dishonest political activism&quot; without the knowledge of the local congregations.51
Outcries have been so strong among conservative congregations that they have ended their affiliations with the denomination, in many cases terminating decades of association with one of the UCC's four major traditions. This became especially pronounced in the months following the decision of General Synod 25 to endorse same-sex marriage. Three denominations have in particular been beneficiaries of their decisions: the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches (founded in the late 1950s in opposition to the UCC merger), the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference (founded in the 1940s as a fundamentalist alternative), and the Evangelical Association of Reformed and Congregational Christian Churches (founded in the 1990s, mostly by E&amp;R-heritage churches). However, quite a number of withdrawing congregations have decided to operate independently, influenced perhaps by the recent growth and success of non-denominational fellowships throughout the U.S.
Still other congregations have decided to remain in the denomination but withhold financial support for &quot;Our Church's Wider Mission&quot; (OCWM). They say their goal is to avoid funding conference and national programs and policies they find objectionable. Many of those churches are openly affiliated with two conservative &quot;renewal&quot; organizations, the Biblical Witness Fellowship and the North Carolina-based Faithful and Welcoming group, both of which have tried, largely unsuccessfully, to lobby the General Synod (and some conferences) to renounce politically and theologically liberal stances on a number of issues.
However, some individuals and families have deserted those congregations remaining loyal to the UCC, in favor of more theologically and politically moderate mainline churches or conservative evangelical congregations. Even so, it has been reported at General Synod 2011 that 175 new churches have joined the UCC in the two previous years, which amounts to more than any similar time period in the last 40 years. The new churches represent new church starts as well as existing churches who were associated with other denominations or loosely associated with the UCC.
Barack Obama and the UCC
A controversy arose over Obama speaking at UCC gatherings, but the IRS found that the UCC had adhered to the prohibition against churches campaigning for political candidates.
In 2007, US Presidential candidate and longtime UCC member Barack Obama spoke at the UCC's Iowa Conference meeting and at the General Synod 26.52 A complaint filed with the Internal Revenue Service alleged that the UCC promoted Obama's candidacy by having him speak at those meetings.53
Barry Lynn, an ordained UCC minister and the executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, stated that although he personally would not have invited a Presidential candidate to speak at the meetings, he believed &quot;the Internal Revenue Service permits this to happen.&quot;54 The church had consulted lawyers prior to the event to make sure they were following the law and had instructed those in attendance that no Obama campaign material would be allowed in the meeting. Nevertheless, in February 2008, the IRS sent a letter to the church stating that it was launching an inquiry into the matter.55
On February 27, 2008, in an open letter to UCC members, Rev. John H. Thomas announced the creation of The UCC Legal Fund, to aid in the denomination's defense against the IRS.56 While the denomination expects legal expenses to surpass six figures, it halted donations after raising $59,564 in less than a week.
In May 2008, the IRS issued a letter which states that the UCC had taken appropriate steps and that the denomination's tax status was not in jeopardy. 57
Membership
At the time of its formation, the UCC had over 2 million members in nearly 7,000 churches.58 The denomination has suffered a 44 percent loss in membership since the mid-1960s.59 By 1980, membership was at about 1.7 million and by the turn of the century had dropped to 1.3 million.60 In 2006, the UCC had roughly 1.2 million members in 5,452 churches.61 According to its 2008 annual report, the United Church of Christ has about 1.1 million members in about 5,300 local congregations.62 However the 2010 report confirms that there has been a decline of 31 thousand members and a loss of 33 congregations since then. It's possible that the church will record higher membership and affiliation rates in future as many congregations already affiliated to denominations, such as the Disciples of Christ, request dual membership.
Membership is concentrated primarily in the Northeast and Midwest, the two regions of the U.S. where population has declined the strongest since the denomination's inception. Pennsylvania, a bastion of the German Reformed tradition, has the largest number of members and churches. As of 2000, the state had over 700 congregations and over 200,000 members.63 The highest membership rates are in the states of Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, situated in the heartland of the American Congregationalist movement.64
