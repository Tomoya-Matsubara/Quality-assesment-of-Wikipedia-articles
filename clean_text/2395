WindSeeker is a  thrill ride at several Cedar Fair parks. The Mondial rides were opened for the 2011 season at Ontario's Canada's Wonderland, Ohio's Cedar Point and Kings Island, but still under construction on California's Knott's Berry Farm at a cost of $5,000,000 each. The three-minute ride features 32 suspended twin seats (64 seats total) which spin around a central tower. Also, an LED lighting package was installed on all four WindSeekers.1234 There are strips of LED lights mounted on the arms that support the swings and colored floodlights which light up all of WindSeeker's tower from above. Canada's Wonderland was the first of the four parks to have their WindSeeker open. On May 24, 2011 the ride first opened for only an hour until problems with the ride were found causing the ride to be closed for repairs.56 The second WindSeeker was officially opened to the public at Cedar Point on June 14, 2011.7 On June 21, 2011, Kings Island officially opened their WindSeeker to the public.8
History
Throughout August 2010, several hints were dropped on the official Facebook pages of several Cedar Fair amusement parks about a 2011 ride. On August 24, 2010, at 2pm, Canada's Wonderland, Cedar Point, Kings Island and Knotts Berry Farm all announced that they would be adding a Mondial WindSeeker for the 2011 season. At the time, all four WindSeekers were due to open sometime in spring 2011.9s drops more hints on 2011 ride&quot; /&gt;s Berry Farm Announces Windseeker (WC)&quot;/&gt;101112s new ride a swing at variety&quot;/&gt;1314
Construction for the WindSeekers at Canada's Wonderland, Cedar Point and Kings Island began around late October and early November. To install the ride Canada's Wonderland's Jet Scream was removed and Cedar Point's Ocean Motion was relocated to another area within the park.151617 Construction was scheduled to begin around the same time at Knott's Berry Farm with the removal of the Sky Cabin.18 However, after two-month delay it was announced on January 7, 2011, that their WindSeeker would not replace the Sky Cabin and would instead be located within the Fiesta Village section of the park.19 Work began almost immediately after this announcement.20

 Kings Island's WindSeeker was originally scheduled to be the first to open on April 30, 2011;26 however, due to inclement weather its opening was delayed indefinitely.27 On the morning of June 21, 2011, the ride officially opened to the public.28
The WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland was originally scheduled to open on May 8, 2011 &lt;U+2013&gt; one week after the Kings Island installation.29 During ride testing a series of problems were discovered. On May 24, 2011, after a 16-day delay, Canada's Wonderland announced on their Facebook page that Windseeker would open to the public later that day.30 After only one hour of operation, the ride was closed due to the discovery of further mechanical problems.31 On June 2, 2011 the ride officially opened to the public. Since its official opening on June 2, the ride has been intermittently operating due to a variety of problems which have slowly been resolved.
Cedar Point's WindSeeker was originally scheduled to open on May 14, 2011 &lt;U+2013&gt; two weeks after the scheduled opening of the first WindSeeker at Kings Island.32 After almost a month of inclement weather which delayed construction and testing, the ride officially opened to the public on June 14, 2011.33
Knott's Berry Farm's WindSeeker will be the last to officially open to the public. The ride is now scheduled to open around the middle of July 2011 after several months of delays.3435 The WindSeeker tower at Knott's Berry Farm features a different color scheme. Unlike the white, blue, and green of the other towers, Knott's tower has orange, purple, and yellow colors.36
Problems
 The four WindSeekers are based on the same prototype design by Dutch amusement ride manufacturer, Mondial Rides. The WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland was the first to be completed and thus the first to be tested. While testing the ride it was discovered that the swings could swing back and forth once the rotation was at full speed. In some cases, the swings were almost hitting each other. For this reason, hydraulic dampers (that were not a part of the original design of the ride) were added to all four WindSeekers being built in order to reduce the amount of the movement of the swings while in operation.37
 Despite the addition of these dampers, the same problem can still occur. On June 14, 2011, some riders on Cedar Point's WindSeeker could have been injured as all of the swings swayed in different directions causing some seats to almost collide with each other. In one reported case, a rider had to stick out their leg to stop the seats in front of them from hitting them. The ride operated for the full 3 minutes and once the swings reached the bottom, the ride was closed until the winds calmed down.38 This event may have showed that under high winds, the hydraulic dampers can &quot;fail&quot;. It has been suggested that an unbalanced swing structure (i.e. with some swings full and others not), coupled with high winds could cause the individual swings to crash into each other.39 On June 29, 2011, Breakfast Television Toronto's Jennifer Valentyne rode the WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland for her &quot;Live-Eye&quot; segment. When the swings reached the top of the tower, the seats began swinging and hitting each other. As the ride continued its operation, Breakfast Television hosts Kevin Frankish and Dina Pugliese showed their concern with Dina asking whether the seats are supposed to touch each other, only to receive no response.40 No reason can be determined as to why the dampers failed on this occasion.
Additional problems have also been discovered with the ride after their opening to the public. Canada's Wonderland's WindSeeker underwent repairs for just over one week went a fault was discovered. One of the thirty-two pairs of seats were removed from the ride for an unknown reason.41 The seats were replaced and testing for the ride began shortly after. In another case at Canada's Wonderland, riders got stuck at the top of the WindSeeker tower for 20 minutes when the swings did not come down.42
Structure
All four WindSeekers consist of the same parts which form an identical structure. The -tall center tower is made up of 8 parts. Only the base section is different from the others because it must support the rest of the tower. On the top of the 8th tower piece, there is a steel platform where workers and mechanics can observe the operations of the ride and perform maintenance from above. An element described as the &quot;red UFO&quot; or &quot;the Crown&quot; exists above this platform. The swings themselves are made up of a number of parts. Most of the parts go towards the structure of the swing. In the middle of the structure there are a couple of mechanical wheels that allow the swings to rotate as it makes it way up and down the tower. The swings are brought up and down by a number of cables that are attached from the swing structure to a number of yellow wheels attached to the steel platform at the top of the tower.43 Since the discovery that the seats could swing back and forth, hydraulic dampers (that were not apart of the original design of the ride) were added to all four WindSeekers being built in order to reduce the amount of the movement of the swings while in operation.44 Below is a break-down of the ride to show where the parts are located on the ride and what they look like. 
Ride experience
Riders take a seat in one of the 64 seats placed around a central tower which brings the swings up and down. A restraint bar is then put onto the riders lap making sure the rider stays firmly in the seat. There is no seat belt to put across the riders lap, only one that is attached to the seat to the restraint bar in-case the lock on the restraint bar fails. After the operators say that it is safe to operate, the swing begins to make its way up to the top of the tower with music (mostly from movies) is played while the ride is in operation. The swing slowly begins to spin around the central tower and pick up speed as it continues its way up. By the time the swing reaches the top, it is rotating around the tower at its full speed of approximately . Before the swing begins its descent, the swing remains at the top of the tower for just over one minute. Once the swing begins its descent, the swings speed instantly begins to slow down. By the time the swing reaches the bottom of the tower the swing is at a complete stop. When the swings reaches the ground, the riders exit the ride and the next set of riders enter. One cycle of the ride lasts three minutes.4546474849
Ride features


Any information below may change when more information about the ride is released. What is below is what has been confirmed by external sources and as more features are confirmed, it will be added below. For these reasons, the features are listed separately for each park.

Canada's Wonderland

There are JBL speakers mounted to the inside of the swing structure which provided music from movies to riders as the swings go up and down.50 It is also still unknown if the WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland plays the same 18 music tracks as Cedar Point.
Unlike Cedar Point, as the swings make their way up the tower, the LED lights at the top of the tower do not turn off and remain on though out the whole operation cycle keeping the tower mostly visible at all times.51

Cedar Point

Just like Canada's Wonderland, there are JBL speakers mounted to the inside of the swing structure which provided music from movies to riders as the swings go up and down.52 There are 18 different music tracks that are played on the ride. Some are: Hedwig&lt;U+2019&gt;s Theme (From the Harry Potter films), the theme song for Star Trek: The Next Generation and songs from Flight of the Valkyries.53
When the swings make their way up the tower, the LED lights at the top of the tower completely turn off making the tower &quot;invisible&quot; and only the LED lights on the swings visible. When the swings come back down, the LED lights turn back on.54
The sign at the bottom of the ride that says WindSeeker changes colors as the lights on the swings change as well.55

Kings Island

Just like Canada's Wonderland and Cedar Point, there are JBL speakers mounted to the inside of the swing structure which provided music from movies to riders as the swings go up and down. It is also still unknown if the WindSeeker at Kings Island plays the same 18 music tracks as Canada's Wonderland and Cedar Point.
Just like Cedar Point, the sign at the bottom of the ride that says WindSeeker changes colors as the lights on the swings change as well.56

Knott's Berry Farm
No features have currently been announced.
Reception
Just over a week after the official opening of the ride at Cedar Point, noted attraction reviewer Brian Krosnick of Theme Park Tourist submitted a review of the ride on their website stating that the WindSeeker &quot;is truly breathtaking&quot;. The review applauded Cedar Fair for &quot;the inclusion of on-ride audio and such an exemplary lighting package&quot; stating it was &quot;more than anyone expected or could&lt;U+2019&gt;ve asked for&quot;. Brian Krosnick pointed out that due to the location of the ride beside Lake Erie and hot summers, the ride attracts massive &quot;clouds&quot; of bugs during the night which follow the lights on the ride. Finally, the review concluded that the ride cycle might be too short for the type of ride WindSeeker is as you don't stay at the top of the ride for very long.57 The full review can be seen here. Members of the general public have also applauded the addition.58
