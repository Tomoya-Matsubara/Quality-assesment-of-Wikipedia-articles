 In Norse mythology, Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n (Old Norse &quot;protectoress&quot;1) is a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n appears in a poem in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n has been theorized as possibly another name for Frigg.
Attestations
In the Poetic Edda poem V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lusp&lt;U+00E1&gt;, Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n receives a mention regarding the foretold death of the god Odin during the immense battle waged at Ragnar&lt;U+00F6&gt;k:



Then is fulfilled Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's

second sorrow,

when &lt;U+00D3&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;inn goes

to fight with the wolf,

and Beli's slayer,

bright, against Surtr.

Then shall Frigg's

sweet friend fall.2



In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n is cited twelfth among a series of sixteen goddesses. High tells Gangleri (earlier in the book described as King Gylfi in disguise) that Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n &quot;is given the function of protecting people whom Frigg wishes to save from some danger.&quot; High continues that, from this, &quot;someone who escapes finds refuge (hleinar).&quot;3 In chapter 51, the above mentioned V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lusp&lt;U+00E1&gt; stanza is quoted.4 In chapter 75 of the book Sk&lt;U+00E1&gt;ldskaparm&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n appears within a list of 27 &lt;U+00E1&gt;synjur names.5
In skaldic poetry, the name Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n is frequent in kennings for women. Examples include Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n hringa (Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n of rings), Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n go&lt;U+00F0&gt;vefjar (Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n of velvet) and arm-Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n (arm-Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n). The name is already used frequently in this way by the 10th-century poet Korm&lt;U+00E1&gt;kr &lt;U+00D6&gt;gmundarson and remains current in skaldic poetry through the following centuries, employed by poets such as &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;r&lt;U+00F0&gt;r Kolbeinsson, Gizurr &lt;U+00DE&gt;orvaldsson and Einarr Gilsson.6
Theories
Andy Orchard says that in V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lusp&lt;U+00E1&gt;, Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n appears to be just another name for Frigg, and adds that &quot;the numerous occurrences of the name in skaldic poetry in poetic periphrases or kennings for women do nothing to dispel the confusion.&quot;7 Rudolf Simek agrees that Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n seems to appear as another name for Frigg in V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lusp&lt;U+00E1&gt;, and that in skaldic poetry Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n was a well known mythological figure by the 10th century. Simek states that Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n is likely simply another name for Frigg, and that Snorri &quot;misunderstood her to be a goddess in her own right in his reading of the V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lusp&lt;U+00E1&gt; stanza.&quot;8
However, in the same work, Rudolf Simek also says that the goddesses S&lt;U+00E1&gt;ga, Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n, Sj&lt;U+00F6&gt;fn, Snotra, V&lt;U+00E1&gt;r, and V&lt;U+00F6&gt;r should be considered vaguely defined figures who &quot;should be seen as female protective goddesses&quot; that are all responsible for &quot;specific areas of the private sphere, and yet clear differences were made between them so that they are in many ways similar to matrons.&quot;9 John Lindow observes that if Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n is indeed Frigg, then this means that Hl&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's &quot;second sorrow&quot; in V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lusp&lt;U+00E1&gt; is the death of Baldr.10
