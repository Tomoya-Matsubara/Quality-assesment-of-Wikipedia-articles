 This is a list of speakers who have addressed both Houses of the United Kingdom Parliament at the same time. French President Albert Lebrun was the first person to address both the House of Commons and the House of Lords in March 1939. The list excludes the speeches given by the reigning British Monarch at the State Opening of Parliament.1
Only two people besides the reigning British Monarch at the time have addressed both Houses together on more than one occasion. Nelson Mandela spoke to Members of the Commons and the Lords in 1993 and in 1996 as President of South Africa. Mikhail Gorbachev addressed the Houses as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1984 and again, in 1993, on behalf of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
As of March 2008, Nicolas Sarkozy, the President of France, was the most recent person to present to both Houses at once.
