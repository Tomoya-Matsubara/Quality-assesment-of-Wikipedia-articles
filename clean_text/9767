Arnot Art Museum, opened 1913, is a municipal art museum located at 235 Lake Street in Elmira, New York. Its permanent collection includes 17th-, 18th-, and 19th-century European paintings; and 19th- and 20th-century American art. Its 21st-century collection focuses on contemporary representational art. The building is a contributing property in the Elmira Civic Historic District.
Building
The museum was founded by banker Matthias Hallenback Arnot (1833 - 1910), who bequeathed to the City of Elmira his art collection and the building that housed it.1 The original Greek-Revival mansion was built in 1833 by his father, John Arnot, Sr. Matthias built the picture gallery addition in the 1890s, which featured extensive gas lighting and a large skylight.2 It is a rare example of a 19th-century private picture gallery that retains its original art collection.3
A new wing was added to the museum in 1982.
