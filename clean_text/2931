William Franklin Raynolds (March 17, 1820 &lt;U+2013&gt; October 18, 1894) was a U.S. Army officer, explorer, engineer, and a veteran of both the Mexican-American War and American Civil Wars. Raynolds is best known for leading the 1859&lt;U+2013&gt;1860 Raynolds Expedition while serving as a member of the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers.
During the 1840s and 1850s, and again after his participation in the American Civil War, Raynolds was the head engineer on numerous lighthouse construction projects. Raynolds oversaw riverway and harbor dredging projects intended to improve accessibility and navigation for shipping. As a cartographer, Raynolds participated in surveying and mapping areas of the Great Lakes and other regions. At least six lighthouses whose construction he oversaw are still standing. Some are still in use and of these, several are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
In 1848, during the American occupation of Mexico after the Mexican-American War, Raynolds and other U.S. Army personnel were the first to summit Pico de Orizaba, the tallest mountain in Mexico, and inadvertently set what may have been the American alpine altitude record for the subsequent 50 years. In 1859, Raynolds was placed in charge of the first U.S. Government sponsored expedition to venture into the upper Yellowstone region that was later to become Yellowstone National Park. Heavy winter snowpack in the Wind River Range of Wyoming prevented the expedition from reaching the Yellowstone Plateau. Consequently, the expedition was forced to diverge to the south and became the first U.S. Government expedition to cross what is known as Union Pass, enter Jackson Hole and see the Teton Range, now within Grand Teton National Park.
During the American Civil War, Raynolds participated in the Battle of Cross Keys during the Valley Campaign of 1862, and a year later was in charge of fortifications in the defense of the military arsenal at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. In 1865, Raynolds was promoted to the temporary rank of Brevet Brigadier General for meritorious service during the Civil War. He retired from the Corps of Engineers on March 17, 1884 with the rank of Colonel, after a 40-year military career.
Early life
William Franklin Raynolds was born on March 17, 1820 in Canton, Ohio.1 He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York on July 1, 1839 after being appointed from his native state of Ohio.23 Raynolds graduated fifth out of 39 classmates in his class of 1843, which included William B. Franklin, Raynolds's friend Joseph J. Reynolds and future President Ulysses S. Grant.45
Military career
Initially appointed a Brevet Second Lieutenant in the 5th U.S. Infantry, within a few weeks Raynolds was transferred to the newly formed U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers.6 The Topographical Engineers performed surveys and developed maps for army use until their merger with the Corps of Engineers in 1863.7 Raynolds's first assignments from 1843 to 1844 were as an assistant topographical engineer involved in improving navigation on the Ohio River and surveying the northeastern boundary of the U. S. between the years 1844 and 1847.8
Mexican-American War
 When war with Mexico seemed imminent, topographic engineers were sent to the border to assist with the army's preparations. Raynolds served in Winfield Scott's Mexican-American War campaign which marched overland to Mexico City from the Gulf of Mexico seaport at Veracruz. After the war, the American army occupied Mexico City and the surrounding region. During the occupation, Raynolds and others set out to map and explore nearby mountains. Raynolds's party is credited with being the first to climb to the summit of Pico de Orizaba () which at , is the tallest mountain in Mexico and third tallest in North America.910 The effort to climb Pico de Orizaba involved a long pack train of nearly fifty officers, soldiers and native guides, which started out from the town of Orizaba in early May, 1848. After two days of climbing they camped out at . The following morning, May 10, 1848, about two dozen climbers made the final push to the top of the mountain, but only Raynolds and four to five others ended up summiting.11 This feat may have inadvertently set the American mountaineering altitude record for the subsequent 50 years.12 Raynolds estimated the summit of Pico de Orizaba to be  above sea level, which was slightly greater than previous estimates but below the modern known altitude. As no higher peaks were known in North America at that time, Raynolds believed Pico de Orizaba was the tallest mountain on the continent.13 The American achievement was in dispute until a 1851 French expedition discovered an American flag on the summit with the year 1848 carved in the flagpole.14
Lighthouse engineer
After returning from Mexico, Raynolds resumed mapping the U.S.&lt;U+2014&gt;Canada border which he had been surveying before the war, then embarked on a project to develop water resources for the nation's growing capital of Washington, D.C.. Raynolds then traveled the Great Lakes for several years surveying and mapping shorelines while identifying potential lighthouse locations.15 After promotion to First Lieutenant and then Captain, in 1857 he was assigned to design and supervise the construction of lighthouses along the Jersey Shore of New Jersey and the Delmarva Peninsula regions.16 In less than two years Raynolds supervised construction of the Fenwick Island Light in Delaware,17 the Finns Point Range Light,18 Cape May Light19 and the Absecon Light, which are in New Jersey.20
Raynolds Expedition

In early 1859 Raynolds was charged with leading an expedition into the Yellowstone region of Montana and Wyoming to determine, &quot;as far as practicable, everything relating to ... the Indians of the country, its agricultural and mineralogical resources ... the navigability of its streams, its topographical features, and the facilities or obstacles which the latter present to the construction of rail or common roads ...&quot;.21 The expedition was carried out by a handful of technicians, including geologist/naturalist F.V. Hayden, who led several later expeditions to the Yellowstone region, photographer and topographer James D. Hutton and artist and mapmaker Anton Sch&lt;U+00F6&gt;nborn.2223 Raynold's second-in-command was Lt. Henry E. Maynadier. The expedition was supported by a small infantry detachment of 30 and was funded with $60,000 by the U.S. Government. Experienced mountain man Jim Bridger was hired to guide the expedition.24  The expedition started in late May 1859 at St. Louis, Missouri, from where the party was transported by two steamboats up the Missouri River to New Fort Pierre, South Dakota.25 In late June the expedition left New Fort Pierre and headed overland to Fort Sarpy where they encountered the Crow Indians, described by Raynolds as, &quot;a small band compared to their neighbors, but are famous warriors, and, according to common report, seldom fail to hold their own with any of the tribes unless greatly outnumbered.&quot;26 Raynolds was impressed with the Crow chief Red Bear, and after assuring him that the expedition meant to only pass through Crow Indian territory and not linger, the Crows gave the expedition seven horses in trade for a few presents.27
Raynolds divided his expedition, sending a smaller detachment under Maynadier to explore the Tongue River, a major tributary of the Yellowstone River. James D. Hutton and Zephyr Recontre, the expedition's Sioux interpreter, took a side trip to locate an isolated rock formation that had been seen from great distance by a previous expedition in 1857. Hutton was the first person of European descent to reach the rock formation in northeastern Wyoming, later known as Devils Tower; Raynolds never elaborated on this event in great detail, mentioning it only in passing.2829 By September 2, 1859, Raynolds's detachment had followed the Yellowstone River to the confluence with the Bighorn River.30 The two parties under Raynolds and Maynadier reunited on October 12, 1859 and wintered at Deer Creek Station, on the Platte River in central Wyoming.31
In May 1860, the expedition recommenced their explorations, with Raynolds leading a party north up the Wind River, hoping to cross the mountains at Togwotee Pass, a mountain pass expedition guide Jim Bridger knew about. Meanwhile, Maynadier led his party back to the Bighorn River region. The plan was for the two parties to reunite on June 30, 1860 at Three Forks, Montana, so they could make observations of a total solar eclipse forecast for July 18, 1860.3233 Hampered by towering basaltic cliffs and deep snows, Raynolds attempted for over a week to reconnoiter to the top of Togwotee Pass, but was forced south due to the June 30 deadline for reaching Three Forks. Bridger then led the party south over another pass that Raynolds named Union Pass, to the west of which lay Jackson Hole and the Teton Range. From there the expedition went southwest, crossing the southern Teton Range at Teton Pass and entering Pierre's Hole in present day Idaho.34 Though Raynolds and his party managed to get to Three Forks at the scheduled date, Maynadier's party was several days late, and the planned small detachment that was supposed to head due north to observe the solar eclipse was cancelled due to lack of time.35 Heading east, the reunited expedition recrossed the Rocky Mountains and traveled via steamboat downstream to Omaha, Nebraska where the expedition members were disbanded in October 1860.36  Though the Raynolds Expedition was unsuccessful in exploring the region that later became Yellowstone National Park, they were the first U.S. Government sponsored party to enter Jackson Hole and observe the Teton Range.37 The expedition covered over  and explored an area of nearly .38 In a preliminary report sent east in 1859, Raynolds stated that the once abundant bison were being killed for their hides at such an alarming rate that they might soon become extinct.39 Raynold's participation in the American Civil War almost immediately after the expedition concluded, as well as a severe illness he suffered afterwards, delayed him from presenting his report on the expedition until 1868. A combination of failure to reach the fabled sights of the Yellowstone region as well as the outbreak of the war relegated the Raynold's Expedition to near obscurity, but his map was in high demand and was published in 1864.40 Botanical specimens, fossils and geological items that were collected during the expedition were sent to the Smithsonian Institution but were not studied in detail until after the war. Much of the artwork created by Hutton and especially Sch&lt;U+00F6&gt;nborn was lost, though several of Sch&lt;U+00F6&gt;nborn's chromolithographs appeared in F.V. Hayden's 1883 report that was submitted after later expeditions.41
American Civil War
Raynolds returned to Washington at the outbreak of the war, and was made chief topographic engineer of the Department of Virginia in July, 1861. The army lacked adequate maps for military use, so Raynolds and his team of engineers began to survey and draw up maps of Virginia and the region of the western portion of that state that had remained loyal to the Union and would become the new state of West Virginia during the war. In 1862, Raynolds was engaged with John C. Fr&lt;U+00E9&gt;mont's Mountain Department in chasing Stonewall Jackson up the Shenandoah Valley and participated in the Battle of Cross Keys.42
Raynolds spent two months recovering from illness after the Valley Campaign, then was assigned as chief engineer of Middle Department and VIII Corps in January 1863. Promoted Major in the Corps of Engineers, from March 1863 Raynolds found himself in charge of the defenses of vital Harpers Ferry, West Virginia during Robert E. Lee's second Confederate invasion of the north during the Gettysburg Campaign.43
As the end of war approached and hostilities with the Sioux Indians loomed, Raynolds's knowledge and experiences of the Great Lakes region became more important to the army than his command of the fortifications of Harpers Ferry. Consequently in April 1864 Raynolds returned to the Great Lakes as superintending engineer of surveys and lighthouses and saw no further combat for the rest of his career.44
Post war career
Raynolds was brevetted Brigadier General for his Civil War service and promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in the Corps of Engineers in 1865. After the Civil War, the Corps of Engineers undertook a program of river and harbor improvements. Raynolds supervised the dredging and improvement of navigation on the Arkansas, Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. He was involved in supervision of harbor dredging and construction in Buffalo, New York, Harbor of Refuge in New Buffalo, Michigan, Erie Harbor in Erie, Pennsylvania, and the river harbors of St. Louis, Missouri and Alton, Illinois.45 Raynolds sited and oversaw the installation of dozens of lighthouses in the Great Lakes area where he served as the superintending engineer from 1864 to 1870.46 After that Raynolds supervised lighthouse construction along the Gulf Coast and again in New Jersey where he managed the construction of the Hereford Inlet Lighthouse in 187447 and the original New Castle Range Front Light and New Castle Range Rear Lighthouses in 1876.48 He continued serving with the Corps of Engineers in a variety of harbor and river navigational improvements until his retirement in 1884.49
As he approached retirement, Raynolds was elected trustee of the Presbyterian Church.50 According to West Point classmate Joseph Reynolds, who saw William Raynolds at the West Point graduates reunion in 1893, Raynolds had maintained a vigorous and healthy appearance long after his retirement, his brown hair &quot;then but slightly sprinkled with gray ...&quot;51 Raynolds died on October 18, 1894 in Detroit Michigan, leaving his widow a substantial estate for the time, estimated at between $50,000 and $100,000.52 After providing for his widow, his will directed that after her death, the entire estate would be donated to the Presbyterian Church.5354
Legacy

The construction of the Cape May Lighthouse was overseen by Raynolds in 1859 and the lighthouse is still in use. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

Though overshadowed by the Civil War, the Raynolds Expedition produced maps that were used by subsequent explorers to the greater Yellowstone region.55 Raynolds also located suitable wagon routes in the Bighorn Basin region and was able to help narrow down the most appropriate routes for a future transcontinental railroad. The Raynolds Expedition also determined that few if any riverways would be suitable for steamboats due to numerous rapids and steep downstream gradients that would prevent upstream movement by steamboats.56 A number of lighthouses Raynolds designed or supervised the construction of are still in use and several are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.57
At least two geographical locations are named for William Raynolds. The mountain gap where the Raynolds Expedition crossed the Continental Divide between southwest Montana and northeast Idaho is named Raynolds Pass, ()5859 and Raynolds Peak () is an isolated peak in the Teton Range that was named after him in 1938.606162 Additionally, the fossil remains of the extinct gastropod Viviparus raynoldsanus was named by F.V. Hayden in honor of Raynolds after the specimen was collected during the expedition in the Powder River region of Montana.6364
