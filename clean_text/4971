Federico Heraclio Cant&lt;U+00FA&gt; Garza (March 3, 1907 &lt;U+2013&gt; January 29, 1989) was a Mexican painter, engraver and sculptor. While considered to be a member of the Mexican muralism movement, his style was noticeably different, mostly for adhering to older and more academic forms of painting and sculpture. He has his most success exhibiting in the United States and Europe, but he did murals and sculptures in Mexico. His best known work is a sculpture called &lt;U+201C&gt;La maternidad&lt;U+201D&gt; which has been adapted as logo of the Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social (IMSS).
Life
Cant&lt;U+00FA&gt; was born to Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Luiza Garza, a novelist and Adolfo Cant&lt;U+00FA&gt;, a journalist who opposed the Porfirio D&lt;U+00ED&gt;az regime. He was born shortly before the Mexican Revolution and spent his childhood split between Nuevo Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n and San Antonio, Texas, with the family moving back permanently to Mexico in the 1920s.12 He was born on March 3, 1907 in Monterrey, but later in life, he changed his birth year to 1908 and his birthplace to Cadereyta Jim&lt;U+00E9&gt;nez, where he family was originally from.345
In 1922, at age 14, Cant&lt;U+00FA&gt; entered the Escuela de Pintura al Aire Libre which was directed by Alfredo Ramos Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;nez .67 He had contact with the growing Mexican muralism movement and briefly studied fresco painting under Diego Rivera in 1924.8
From 1924 to 1934, he traveled and lived in Europe and the United States.9 He first went to live in Paris on Rue Delambre in Montparnasse, being only sixteen years old. During his time in Europe he met various artists of the avant garde of the time including Picasso, Alfonso Reyes, poet C&lt;U+00E9&gt;sar Vallejo and sculptor Mateo Hern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez and studied with sculptor Jose de Creeft .1011 When he lived in Paris, he gathered a collection of drawings called the &lt;U+201C&gt;Paris Collection&lt;U+201D&gt; by his son Federico Cantu Fabila. However, during his time there, he created over two chests of drawings made at Le Grande Chaumi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re. These chests were lost.12 In 1929, he married his first wife, Luz Fabila.13 His time in the United States were short periods. He left Europe for Mexico in 1934.14 In the 1930s, he joined a group of painters with the In&lt;U+00E9&gt;s Amor gallery but soon after, established a studio in New York as friends of his from Montparnasse were there to escape the Second World War .15
He died on January 29, 1989.16 His remains are at the foot of his mural Dios Padre y crucifixion (1959) at the chapel of the Universidad Intercontinental in Tlalpan.17
Career
Cant&lt;U+00FA&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s career extended over 65 years and included exhibitions, monumental works, design, illustrations and more.18 From 1924 to 1931 he exhibited his work in the United States and Europe, with his first exhibition occurring at the Exposition Park Museum in Los Angeles .1920 His first exhibition in Mexico was in 1933 at the Sal&lt;U+00F3&gt;n de Arte of the Secretar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a de Educaci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n P&lt;U+00FA&gt;blica. While living in New York, he took part in several collective shows.2122 He had much of his success in these two places, with other shows at Tate Gallery in London, the Museum of Modern Art, the Macy&lt;U+2019&gt;s Gallery and the Perls Gallery in New York.23
He did monumental works such as murals and sculptures, with one of the first a mural with Roberto Montenegro in 1934.24 These works can be found at universities, government buildings and private homes.25 From 1951 to the early 1960s, he devoted most of his time painting murals in private homes, with a number of these since acquired by the government of Nuevo Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n.2627 In the 1950s, he created a mural at the headquarters of the Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social in Mexico City called &lt;U+201C&gt;Las Ense&lt;U+00F1&gt;anzas de Quetzalcoatl&lt;U+201D&gt; and another called &lt;U+201C&gt;Maternidad Yacente.&lt;U+201D&gt; The first was damage by the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, repaired by his son, Cantu Fabila and his wife Elsa. In 1958 he sculpted two stone slabs for the exterior of the Unidad Independencia theater in Mexico City. However, the day after they were finished, they were robbed. A similar fate happened to one of the copies of the IMSS emblem.28 He created a low relief called El Flechador del sol in 1961 on the Sierra Madre along the highway between Linares and Galeana in the municipality of Iturbide, Nuevo Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n. However, this work crumbled in 2002, with recovered pieces now on display at a site museum.2930 His last monument was designed in 1988, and dedicated to Alfonso Reyes.31 One notable mural is Los informantes de Sahag&lt;U+00FA&gt;n at the former monastery of San Diego, which was the site of the Pinacoteca Virreinal in Mexico City. He also created a mural dedicated to Greek myth at the Philosophy and Letters department of the Universidad Aut&lt;U+00F3&gt;noma de Nuevo Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n .32 He also created murals for a church in San Miguel Allende but they were defaced due to a dispute between the artist the institution over how the characters were portrayed.3334
One of the murals he did in a private home was that of Benito Coquet, a public official. When he became head of IMSS in 1958, he hired Cant&lt;U+00FA&gt; to sculptures and designs for the Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social.3536 His best known sculpture from this relationship is &lt;U+201C&gt;La maternidad&lt;U+201D&gt; which is used as the symbol of IMSS.37 The emblem is also known as &lt;U+201C&gt;Nuestra Se&lt;U+00F1&gt;ora de Seguro Social&lt;U+201D&gt; (Our Lady of Social Security) .38
In addition to canvas works and monumental pieces, Cant&lt;U+00FA&gt; worked on a number of other projects. In 1945, he began working with Carlos Alvarado Lang, creating burin engraving and dry point.3940 He illustrated poems done by writer friends such as Renato Leduc, Luis Cardoza y Arag&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, Antonin Artaud and Al&lt;U+00ED&gt; Chumacero .41 His first monograph work and book was &lt;U+201C&gt;A Matter of Love&lt;U+201D&gt; by Mackinley Helm, which Cant&lt;U+00FA&gt; illustrated were both published in 1946.42 In addition to the work he did for IMSS, other important sculptures include Las ense&lt;U+00F1&gt;anzas de Quetzalc&lt;U+00F3&gt;atl and Las ense&lt;U+00F1&gt;anzas de cura Hidalgo.43 However, a significant number of his works have been lost for various reasons, especially those done in Europe.44
In addition, Cant&lt;U+00FA&gt; taught both in Mexico and the United States. In the 1940s, he was an instructor at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado &quot;La Esmeralda&quot; in the 1940s.45 in in 1951 he was a guest lecturer at the University of California .46
His work can be found at the Universidad Aut&lt;U+00F3&gt;noma de Nuevo Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, the Basilica de la Purisima in Mexico City, the former monastery of San Diego, the Pinacoteca Virreinal, the Charles Morgan Gallery in New York and Vatican City.47 He has been featured in a number of monographic publications and his work has been covered in books such as Cien a&lt;U+00F1&gt;os a trav&lt;U+00E9&gt;s de cien artistas of the Museo de Arte Contempor&lt;U+00E1&gt;neo de Monterrey (2000) and Arte Nuestro of the Museo Metropolitano de Monterrey (2005) .48 While alive, he had a retrospective at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1970,49 and one of the few to receive homage at the same institution while alive in 1986.5051
After his death his work is still sold and exhibited. In 2005, his painting &lt;U+201C&gt;Mujer Desnuda&lt;U+201D&gt; sold for 19,000 USD at Sotheby&lt;U+2019&gt;s .52 In 2007, the Universidad Aut&lt;U+00F3&gt;noma del Estado de M&lt;U+00E9&gt;xico held a large exhibition of his work for the 100th anniversary of his birth.5354
Artistry
Cant&lt;U+00FA&gt; created watercolors, oils, drawings, inks, prints, monotypes, sculptures and murals.5556 He was admired for the quality of his drawings, which incorporated the people and landscapes of Mexico into his historical and religious works.57
In Europe, he was exposed to the avant garde movements of the time and in Mexico, the dominant form of Mexican muralism. However, Cant&lt;U+00FA&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s style was classical and academic, often combining Classic myth with modern symbolism.5859 This was true even of his mural work and was the only major painter at the time doing religious themes.6061 This put him at the margins of his Mexican muralist contemporaries.62 His dissatisfaction with this situation was expressed by him &lt;U+201C&gt;Is it fair to discount me as a Mexican, just because my paints do not drip mole or sweat pulque?&lt;U+201D&gt;63 However, he has come to be known as &lt;U+201C&gt;El gran olvidado&lt;U+201D&gt; (the great forgotten one) .6465
He was an avid reader, with literature being a major influence on his work. He was especially fond of 15th-century French poet Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Villon, but also read much of the work of Alfonso Reyes, Renato Leduc, Efra&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Huerta, Jean Nicolas, Arthur Rimbaud, Paul Val&lt;U+00E9&gt;ry, Lord Byron, Goethe, Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Malraux, and Paul &lt;U+00C9&gt;luard .6667
