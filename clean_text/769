Toufik Benedictus &quot;Benny&quot; Hinn (born December 3, 1952) is a televangelist, best known for his regular &quot;Miracle Crusades&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; revival meeting/faith healing summits that are usually held in large stadiums in major cities, which are later broadcast worldwide on his television program, This Is Your Day.1
History
Benny Hinn was born in Jaffa, Israel to a Palestinian father1 and an Armenian mother2. He was raised within the Greek Orthodox Church, and attended Georges Vanier Secondary School in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where he was known as Toufik Hinn.
He states that his father was the mayor of Jaffa; and that as a child, he was socially isolated and handicapped by a severe stammer, but was nonetheless a first-class student.2 These claims, however, have been disputed by critics of Hinn.3
He has written that on December 21, 1973, he traveled by charter bus from Toronto to Pittsburgh to attend a &quot;miracle service&quot; conducted by evangelist Kathryn Kuhlman. Although he never met her personally, he often attended her &lt;U+201C&gt;healing services&lt;U+201D&gt; and has often cited her as an influence in his life.4
Hinn founded the Orlando Christian Center in 1983. In 1999, he handed the church (by the time renamed to the World Outreach Center) to Clint Brown and moved to Grapevine, Texas, a suburb of Fort Worth, while maintaining the legal entity &lt;U+201C&gt;World Outreach Center Benny Hinn Ministries&lt;U+201D&gt;. His former church was renamed Faith World Church under pastoring of Clint Brown, who merged his Orlando church with Hinn's.
Hinn is married to Suzanne Harthern and lives in Dana Point, California.
Ministry and theology

Benny Hinn promotes himself as a Christian healing evangelist and Bible teacher. He is the author of a number of best-selling inspirational Christian books. His thirty-minute TV program This Is Your Day, is among the world&lt;U+2019&gt;s most-watched Christian programs, seen on various Christian television networks, including Trinity Broadcasting Network, Daystar Television Network, Revelation TV, The Christian Channel, Vision TV, INSP Networks, and The God Channel.
Hinn conducts regular &quot;Miracle Crusades&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; revival meeting/faith healing events held in sports coliseums and stadiums in major cities throughout the world.
Hinn's teachings are based on Word of Faith theology which espouse belief in the inerrancy of the Bible, contemporary works of the Holy Spirit and the &quot;perpetuity of spiritual gifts&quot; which includes activities such as 'speaking in tongues', faith healing, exorcism, and consequential financial prosperity. The doctrine and practices regarding theological interpretation and worship which Hinn teach are only partly accepted by mainstream Christianity. While almost wholly accepted by the Charismatic Christian community (Christian believers who subscribe to the tenets of the Charismatic Movement and whom, according to a recent study by The Barna Group, make up 46% of the Protestant church and 36% of the Catholic Church5), there are many others in mainstream Christianity who do not subscribe to these particular beliefs. Specific concerns of Hinn's critics include a lack of transparency regarding his personal income derived from ministry, disputes as to substantial claims that the sick are actually healed through his ministry.
Criticism and controversy
Hinn made a number of unfulfilled (religious) prophecies for the 90s, such as God will destroy America's homosexual community in 1995 or the death of Fidel Castro,6 election of the first female president of the USA,7 the East Coast of the United States will be devastated by earthquakes,8 etc., all before the third millennium. Hinn also appeared on the Trinity Broadcasting Network in October 1999 to claim that God had given him a vision that thousands of dead people would be resurrected after watching the network -- laying out of scenario of people placing their dead loved ones' hands on TV screens tuned into the station -- and that TBN would be &quot;an extension of Heaven to Earth.&quot; Hinn has also claimed that Adam was a &quot;superbeing&quot; who could fly to the Moon; that God froze the Red Sea with his breath when he parted it; and that Christ would make a personal appearance at a crusade in Nairobi, Kenya in 2001.
In April 2001 HBO aired a documentary called &quot;A Question of Miracles&quot; on Hinn. 3 The director Antony Thomas told CNN's Kyra Phillips that they did not find cases where people were healed by Hinn.4 Thomas told the New York Times about Hinn's claims, &quot;If I had seen miracles, I would have been happy to trumpet it . . . but in retrospect, I think they do more damage to Christianity than the most committed atheist.&quot;5
In 2002, Joe Nickell of the Skeptical Inquirer wrote a critical analysis of Hinn's healing claims.9 Nickell cited information that Hinn's cures have not been documented by independent reviews, and said &quot;there is a danger that people who believe themselves cured will forsake medical assistance that could bring them relief or even save their lives.&quot;10
In March 2005, Ministry Watch, an independent evangelical organization which reviews Christian ministries for financial transparency and efficiency and advises potential donors accordingly, issued a Donor Alert stating that &quot;the reported exorbitant spending of the Hinn family reveals that BHM has far more money than it needs to carry out its ministry&quot; and advising Christians to &quot;prayerfully consider withholding contributions to Benny Hinn&quot; while praying for his restoration and repentance.11 Benny Hinn Ministries is not a member of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability.12
In November 2006 the CBC Television show the fifth estate did a special titled &quot;Do You Believe in Miracles&quot; on the apparent transgressions committed by Benny Hinn's ministry.13 With the aid of hidden cameras and crusade witnesses, the producers of the show attempted to demonstrate Benny's misappropriation of funds, his fabrication of the truth, and the way in which his staff chose crusade audience members to come on stage for televised healings.14 According to the show the seriously disabled who attend his healings are interviewed and then weeded out from ever getting the chance to come on stage. Instead, those who have minor injuries are brought up in their place. 15 Benny Hinn claims proof from the faithful's doctors that healings have been successful.16 However according to the show none of these doctor notes have ever been produced as evidence to his claims.17
In December 2006, BHM sent out a mailing asking for donations towards a new Gulfstream G4SP jet valued at an estimated $36 million and costs over $600,000/year to maintain and operate.18
Senate investigation
On November 6 2007, United States senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa announced an investigation of Hinn's ministry by the United States Senate Committee on Finance. In a letter to BHM,19 Grassley asked for the ministry to divulge financial information20 to the Senate Committee on Finance to determine if Hinn made any personal profit from financial donations, and requested that Hinn's ministry make the information available by December 6, 2007. The investigation also scrutinized five other televangelists: Paula White, Kenneth Copeland, Eddie Long, Joyce Meyer, and Creflo Dollar2122 . On December 6, 2007, Hinn told the Associated Press that he would not respond to the inquiry until 2008.23
