 The Capuchin Crypt in Brno is a funeral room mainly for Capuchin friars. The crypt was founded in the mid 17th century in the basement of the Capuchin Monastery in the historical centre of Brno.1 The bodies of people buried there turned into mummies because of the geological composition of the ground and the system of airing.2
