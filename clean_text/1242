Afonso (; ; 23 February 1845  11 June 1847) was the heir to the throne of Brazil, bearing the title of Prince Imperial. He was a member of the Brazilian Imperial Family, the son of Emperor Pedro II and Empress Teresa. His birth was welcomed, as it provided Brazil with a male heir to ensure the stability and continuation of the Empire. But his early death ushered in questions as to the monarchy's future.
Birth and Infancy
Afonso Pedro de Alc&lt;U+00E2&gt;ntara Cristiano Leopoldo Filipe Eug&lt;U+00EA&gt;nio Miguel Gabriel Rafael Gonzaga was born on 23 February 1845, the eldest son of Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil and his wife Teresa Cristina. He was a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza which, in turn, traced back to the Capetian dynasty with links to many of the ruling houses of Europe. He was the grandson of Pedro I, Emperor of Brazil and nephew of Maria II, Queen of Portugal.1 Through his mother he was a grandson of Francis I and nephew to Ferdinand II, both Kings of the Two Sicilies in turn.2
 Soon after his birth, the prince was carried in the arms of his father, who proudly presented the newborn to the surrounding crowd in the Imperial Palace. He said, &quot;Gentlemen, here is a Prince whom God...&quot; Here he was overcome with emotion, which hindered him from finishing the phrase.34 The birth of an heir brought joy throughout Brazil.5 Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves de Lima e Silva, Baron of Caxias wrote to his father, the Brigadier General Francisco de Lima e Silva, on 1 May 1845: &quot;No one was happier than I with the news [of the Prince's birth]&quot;.6
Afonso was a very healthy baby, and as eldest son of Pedro II, was heir to the throne and entitled &quot;Prince Imperial&quot;.789 The young prince's face, hair and eyes strongly resembled his father's features.10 For this reason, and because he was the heir presumptive, he became the center of attention.11 However, it was the Emperor who displayed the most interest, as may be perceived in a letter written by Pedro II to his elder sister Maria II, Queen of Portugal, and dated 21 December 1846: &quot;No news here save the good state of health of myself, of the empress, and of the little ones, who are becoming increasingly cute, principally little Afonso, who is already walking and who says many words, still half incomprehensible, which increases their charm.&quot;12
Death
On 11 June 1847, the young Prince was playing in the library of the palace when he suffered a strong attack of convulsions and died, not quite two and a half years old.13 The grief of the Emperor and his wife was enormous. It was feared that the shock might harm Teresa Cristina's health, as she was pregnant at the time with her third child. But on 13 July, she gave birth without complications to a girl who was named Leopoldina Teresa.14 Emperor Pedro II wrote about his son's death in a letter to his stepmother, the Empress Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia, dated 11 July 1847: &quot;With the most piercing grief I tell you that my little Afonso, your godson, unfortunately died of convulsions, which he suffered during five hours on the 4th of last month;15 and a few days ago little Isabel was put at risk by a strong attack of convulsions that greatly frightened me.&quot;16 Afonso is presently buried alongside his younger brother Pedro, his uncle Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Carlos, his aunt Paula Mariana and his niece, Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;sa (Isabel's eldest daughter) in the mausoleum of the Convent of Santo Antonio in Rio de Janeiro.17
The prince's early death (and the later demise of his younger brother) would have an enormous impact on the Brazilian monarch's future. Pedro II's daughter Isabel would eventually become the legal heir to the throne. However, with no tradition of women wielding political and military power, the prospect of a female assuming the throne eventually proved to be an insurmountable obstacle.18 The death of his son caused the Emperor to reevaluate and reframe his purpose and position. &quot;The monarchy as an abstraction, to be passed on to his heir, gave way to his perception of the imperial regime as an emanation of himself and himself alone. He increasingly viewed himself as no more than a head of state of his country for life.&quot;19 For the remainder of his reign, until fate intervened, his focus became to protect the national interests and constitution. In doing this, he increasingly relied on his personal judgement in guiding the nation &quot;solely in accord with what he deemed to be its best interests&quot;.20
