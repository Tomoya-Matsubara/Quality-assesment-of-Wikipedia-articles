Relax The Back is a chain of specialty retail stores with over 120 locations in the United States and Canada, specializing in back support products.

History
The first Relax The Back store opened in Austin, Texas in 1984. In 1987, an entrepreneur named Virginia Rogers purchased the original store and packaged the business into a franchise format.1 The first franchise was opened in San Antonio in 1989 by Coby Dietrick, a former professional basketball player with the San Antonio Spurs.2 In 1996, having grown the chain to 59 stores, Rogers sold the company to a franchisee, Dairl Johnson, for $6 million.3 Johnson continued to develop the company's independent franchising model.4 Relax The Back corporate offices are currently located in La Palma, California.
