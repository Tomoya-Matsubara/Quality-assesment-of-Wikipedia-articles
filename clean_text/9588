Maximum Rocknroll is an album by NOFX that compiles early singles and demo songs. It was released without the band's consent.1 Maximum Rocknroll was originally released on cassette in 19892 by Mystic Records and again three years later on LP and CD.
When the original cassette was released in 1989, it was released under a different title, E is for Everything, though the track listing was identical to the other formats. E is for Everything is currently out of print. The tape also had a different cover, similar to the band's 1985 self-titled EP which depicts a skull with a syringe. The cover of the 1992 version depicts Fat Mike playing his bass.
Fat Mike stated that &quot;This was never supposed to be a record. NOFX got popular in the mid 90's so mystic records took both seven inchers and put them out on a cd with a bunch of demo songs. It's a totally sucky record and the artwork totally bites. We had no control over any of it. In fact we didn't know it was coming out until I saw one in a store. If you want to hear a totally crappy fucked album then this is the one for you. Don't say I didn't warn you.&quot;3
Even though the band claims that Maximum Rocknroll was not released with their consent, it's listed on the discography of their website.4
