Metropolis is an 80-page free weekly city guide, news and classified ads glossy magazine published by Crisscross KK targeting English-speaking foreigners in Tokyo, Japan.1 As of April 2011, its circulation was about 30,000.2
History
The magazine was first published in 1994 as the Tokyo Classified. Early editions, in the broadsheet style, consisted of classified advertisements sourced from shop notice boards.3 Initially distributed with the Daily Yomiuri, the company created an independent distribution network after the newspaper censored advertisements it found objectionable. The magazine is distributed to companies, embassies, hotels, bars, and restaurants.4 The magazine was originally owned and operated by Mark and Mary Devlin. It was renamed Metropolis in 2001.5
Since 1999 the magazine hosted an annual Halloween party &quot;Glitterball&quot; at Roppongi's Velfarre club. Since 2003, Metropolis has donated some of the profits each year to the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Japan and the YMCA.6
Metropolis is owned by Japan Inc. Holdings (JIH).78
