Founded in 2006, the Super League Greece () is the highest professional football league in Greece.
History
In 2006, the Super League Greece replaced the Greek First Division (&lt;U+0391&gt;&lt;U+0384&gt; &lt;U+0395&gt;&lt;U+03B8&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03AE&gt;) as the highest Greek professional football league. The Greek First Division had held the position as the highest level of Greek football since 1959 when it replaced the Panhellenic Championship. In 1959, the First Division, which had been an amateur competition from its inception, turned professional. Up to then the Panhellenic Championship, a cup competition open only to the largest football associations of Athens, Piraeus, Thessaloniki and Patras, had served as the top Greek league. The Panhellenic Championship began in 1906 and ran until superseded by the Greek First Division in 1959. This move came as the Greek First Division had a larger number of clubs and a greater national interest than the Panhellenic Championship. During its fifty-three years, the Panhellenic Championship was run by several organizations in succession. From 1906 to 1913, SEGAS (Contact of Greek Gymnastic and Athletic Associations), the precursor of EPO, had responsibility for the Championship. From 1922 to 1923, the EPSE (Union of Football Associations of Greece) ran it before the EPO took over in 1927. Up to then the Championship was considered an informal and unofficial competition. The first official champion was named in 1928.
Controversies
The Greek championship has been plagued by several controversies over the years. For a long period of time, allegations were put forward by fans of less successfull teams that Olympiacos was operating the so-called &quot;shack&quot; (Greek:&lt;U+03C0&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03AC&gt;&lt;U+03B3&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;), an institution for arranging the results of games by manipulation of teams and referees. This was furthermore accentuated by an informal stating that as long as Olympiakos and Aigaleo (a team that was in League 1 then) win, the rest of the teams were unimportant. Specifically the comments were made in an informal telephone conversation that was unlawfully interecepted ('wiretapped') and leaked to the media. However an official inquiry into these allegations proved nothing and subsequently the case was dismissed without any party being charged. 1 In 2006, a law impacting the immunity of league officials was implemented. FIFA considered the law a threat to the independence of Greek football and consequently banned Greece from all international competitions.2 The ban was lifted a week later, after the law was resigned.3
Structure
 At present, sixteen clubs compete in the Super League, playing each other in a home and away series. At the end of the season, the bottom three clubs are relegated to the Second Division. The top three teams from the Second Division are then promoted from the Second Division to replace the relegated clubs.
The Super League is entitled to two entrants into the 2007-08 UEFA Champions League season. The Super League champion directly enters the 3rd qualifying round of the Champions League. The second through fifth place teams in the Super League enter a play-off for the second Greek entry. The play-off winner enters the Champions League's second qualifying round, a two-legged tie from which the winner advances to the 3rd round qualyfication of the champions league. The winner of the Greek Cup automatically qualifies for the UEFA Cup, as well as the runners-up of the Super League play-off.
In the play-off for Champions League, the teams play each other in a home and away round robin. However, they do not all start with 0 points. Instead, a weighting system applies to the teams' standing at the start of the play-off mini-league. The team finishing fifth in the Super League will start the play off with 0 points. The fifth place team&lt;U+2019&gt;s end of season tally of points is subtracted from the sum of the points that other teams have. This number is then divided by three to give the other teams the points with which they start the mini-league.
