Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; is an ancient Maya site located just north of Lake Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Itz&lt;U+00E1&gt; in the Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Basin region of the southern Maya lowlands. It is a few kilometres from the modern village of San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;, in Guatemala's northern department of Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n. A medium sized civic-ceremonial centre, it was an important political and economic centre during the Late Classic period (AD 650–950).1
The site was first settled between 600 and 300 BC, in the latter portion of the Middle Preclassic period, when it most likely was a fairly small site. This Maya city then had a long and continuous occupational history until the Early Postclassic, up to around AD 1250, with peaks in the Late Preclassic and Late Classic periods.2 Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; had begun to refer to Tikal as its overlord in the late 4th century AD; by the 7th century it had switched its allegiance to Calakmul, Tikal's great rival, before returning its allegiance to Tikal in the early 8th century. In the late 8th century Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; appears to have been conquered by Dos Pilas, capital of the Petexbat&lt;U+00FA&gt;n kingdom.
Most natural resources were easily available in the immediate vicinity of the city. The nearby port at La Trinidad de Nosotros was an important hub for the import of exotic goods and export of local products such as chert and ceramics. Other goods not immediately available were likely to have been provided by the city&lt;U+2019&gt;s satellite sites. The local area provided a number of different soils suitable for varied agricultural use, and the port at La Trinidad de Nosotros provided the city with freshwater products such as turtles, crocodiles and freshwater molluscs. Deer were hunted locally and provided an important source of protein for the upper class, while freshwater snails were the main source of protein for commoners.
Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; has been identified as the source of Ik-style polychrome ceramics bearing painted scenes of the Late Classic Maya aristocracy involved in a variety of courtly activities.3 The Ik-style was characterised by hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour, scenes with dancers wearing masks, and the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life. The city was the capital of a polity that included various satellite sites of varying importance, including a port on the shore of Lake Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Itz&lt;U+00E1&gt;.

Location
Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; is located  from the north shore of Lake Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Itz&lt;U+00E1&gt;, in the centre of the department of El Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n.4 The nearest town is Flores,  to the south, on the other side of the lake. The nearest villages are San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;,  away, and San Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt;s,  away, both are to the south of the site, on the northern shore of the lake. The archaeological site is connected to Nuevo San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;, a northern expansion of San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;, by a dirt road.5 It lies among land that has been cleared of forest within the last century and is now used to plant maize and graze cattle.6
Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; lies on a limestone plateau at the northern edge of the fault depression that underlies the central lakes of the Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Basin.7 The local topography consists of ridges, generally running east-west or northeast-southwest alternating with lower-lying areas with clay soils. These low-lying areas tend to feed into drainage systems flowing into either Lake Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Itz&lt;U+00E1&gt; itself or into the Akte River. The Kantetul River is a seasonal watercourse with its origin  to the northeast of the site and flowing westwards into the Akte River, passing  from the site core.8 The Akte River in turn flows west into the San Pedro River, which flows northwest into Mexico where it joins the Usumacinta River and ultimately empties into the Gulf of Mexico. A mixture of ancient and modern agricultural terraces line the riverbank,  north of the site core.9 Access to water was crucial for Maya cities, since much of the Maya lowlands have been described as a seasonal desert due to the combination of a prolonged dry season lasting between four and six months together with the limestone geography that makes surface water scarce.10 In addition the Maya greatly preferred water to land transport and used canoes to trade extensively by river and sea, and access to river routes connected cities to extensive trade routes.11  Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; lies within a dense cluster of smaller satellite sites.12 It is  to the southwest of the major Classic Period ruins of Tikal.13 The site is about  north of Guatemala City. The ruins are located on a hill about  above mean sea level.14
The site forms part of the Motul Ecological Park (Parque Ecol&lt;U+00F3&gt;gico Motul in Spanish), which is administered by Instituto de Antropolog&lt;U+00ED&gt;a e Historia (IDAEH), the Guatemalan Institute of Anthropology and History), the University of San Carlos of Guatemala (USAC) and the local communities of San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; and Nuevo San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;.15 The park covers an area of approximately .16
Emblem glyph
 Maya cities and kingdoms in the Classic Period were identified in hieroglyphic texts by a distinctive emblem glyph; they are essentially royal titles composed of three distinct parts - the glyphs representing k'uhul and ajau (meaning &quot;divine&quot; and &quot;lord&quot;) followed by the name of the polity this person ruled over.17 The decipherment of emblem glyphs was crucial to the interpreting the political makeup of Classic Period Maya civilization.18
The emblem glyph of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; contains the main sign ik, &quot;breath&quot; or &quot;wind&quot;. It is found on monuments and ceramics from the 8th and 9th centuries. A vessel bearing this emblem and depicting king Lamaw Ek' was found as far away as Altar de Sacrificios. Analysis has revealed that it was manufactured in Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;, indicating some form of interaction between these distant sites.19
Economy

The majority of basic natural resources were readily available in the immediate vecinity of the city, with local soils being suitable for the production of maize and mixed crops to support the local populace.20 The subsidiary site of La Trinidad de Nosotros, located on the shore of Lake Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Itz&lt;U+00E1&gt; some  southeast of the site core, appears to have been an important port for the import and export of goods to and from Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;.21 Food resources not available in the immediate vicinity of the city were probably provided by the satellite sites dispersed at some distance from the site core, and La Trinidad is likely to have played an important part in supplying exotic goods to the city as well as freshwater foodstuffs such as crocodiles, fish and turtles.22 Chert nodules were locally available from the first ridges to the north of the lake.23 A chert workshop has been discovered in the northern sector of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;.24 Ceramic figurines were produced in the Acropolis palace complex in Group C and also in a medium-sized palace complex in Group B, an elite plaza in Group E and also in two elite plazas in the northern part of the site.25
The small satellite site of Chak Maman Tok' several kilometers to the southwest of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;, appears to have been an important centre for the production of chert tools, with only a few other centres within the Maya lowlands manufacturing chert on such a scale. Although very small, Chak Maman Tok' probably played a major part within the economy of the Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; polity.26
Differences in architectural style between elite residential complexes and in the activities carried out at them suggest that the aristocracy of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; was divided into several distinct classes, including the royal family resident in Group C, royal courtiers and low to middle rank nobles.27
The Kantetul River, although now seasonal, is reported to have been a navigable water channel until relatively recently. During the height of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s power, it may have provided an important link to the San Pedro River, a significant trade route in ancient times.28
Ik style ceramics
Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; is possibly the source of the so-called &quot;Ik-style&quot; painted polychrome ceramics, a theory that has recently received additional support from archaeological excavations at the site.29 These ceramic vessels, including finely painted plates and cylindrical vessels, were first asssociated with the then-unidentified site of Ik in the 1970s by the Emblem Glyph included in the hieroglyphic texts on them. The confirmation of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; as Ik came from investigations carried out from 1998 to 2004.30 Chemical analysis of Ik-style ceramics have revealed that they were not only produced in workshops in Motul itself but also in satellite sites in the vicinity.31
The Ik-style ceramic corpus includes a set of features such as hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour and scenes with dancers wearing masks. One of the most distinctive features is the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life, something that is very rare in Mesoamerican art. The corpus is represented by more than 30 intact vessels, the majority of unknown provenance, which have been compared to ceramic fragments recovered from Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; and its satellite sites. The subject matter of the vessels includes courtly life from the Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n region in the 8th century AD, such as diplomatic representations, feasting, bloodletting, scenes of warriors and the sacrifice of prisoners of war.32
The variations in artistic style and chemical composition of the Ik-style ceramics suggests that they were produced in a number of workshops local to the Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; area. They have been subdivided into five types, four from Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; itself and one from one of its satellite sites. There are also various lower-quality examples that are presumed to have been manufactured in sites of lesser importance within the Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; polity. The Ik-style ceramics are believed to have been produced in the period from 740–800 AD. In spite of differences, all the Ik-style ceramics are thought to have been made within a network of allied workshops dedicated to producing vessels for use in the banquets of the aristocracy of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; and of the petty nobility of the capital's satellites.33 The ceramics were distributed widely in the Maya region as gifts in order to seal alliances between the elites of various Maya kingdoms.34
Of particular note is that chemical analysis of ceramic fragments has revealed that the very same workshops not only produced the highest-quality Ik-style polychrome ceramics but also general low-quality ceramics for household use. High quality Ik-style ceramics made at Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; have been excavated from across the Maya region, including Tikal and Uaxact&lt;U+00FA&gt;n to the northeast of the city, Cop&lt;U+00E1&gt;n far to the south, and Altar de Sacrificios, Tamarindito and Seibal, in western Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n.35
A particularly rare feature found on Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; ceramics is the so-called X-ray style, showing a figure wearing a mask but also portraying his face underneath it. All the other representations using this rare style are depicted on Late Classic sculptures at sites with which it is known that Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; had contact at this time, including Dos Pilas, Machaquila, Tikal and Yaxchilan.36 This X-ray style has been found on at least nine painted vessels from Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; and is also used on the west side of Stela 2.37
Occupation and diet
Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; was occupied from the Middle Preclassic right through to the Early Postclassic. However, the height of the city's occupation was the Late Classic.38 Settlement density averages 250 structures per square kilometer (650 structures per square mile) in the site's monumental core, 125 structures per square kilometer (325 structures per square mile) in the city's suburban area and 79 structures per square kilometer (205 structures per square mile) in the site's periphery.39
Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s likely resource catchment zone probably extended between  around the site core and included a number of satellite sites including Kantetul, La Trinidad de Nosotros, Akte, Buena Vista, Chachaklum and Chakokot. This region also includes two major water sources in the form of Lake P&lt;U+00E9&gt;ten Itz&lt;U+00E1&gt; to the south and the Kantetul river  to the north. The area around the city included a variety of soils suitable for agriculture, with 20% of this being very fertile soil highly suited to agriculture, just over 50% of the area was very fertile but required high maintenance (consisting of either fertilization or crop rotation) and 14% being low fertility soil consisting of lowland clay and suitable only for maize or being left unfarmed. Soil analysis has revealed that maize was not only grown in peripheral areas but also close to residential areas throughout Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;.40
Archaeological investigations have revealed that the diet of the inhabitants of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; included dogs (Canis familiaris), turtles including Pond Sliders (Trachemys scripta) and Mesoamerican River Turtles (Dermatemys mawii), freshwater snails (mostly Pomacea flagellata but also Jute snails (Pachychilus spp.)), White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Red Brocket (Mazama americana - a species of small deer) , White-lipped Peccary (Tayassu pecari), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), Lowland Pacas (Cuniculus paca), Central American Agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) and Nine-banded Armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus).41 Only the dog had been domesticated by the Late Classic Maya so the majority of protein in the diet of the inhabitants came from hunting and fishing within the catchment area around the city. The most common food animals were the white-tailed deer, river clam and river turtle.42 Some animal remains were recovered that were clearly associated with elite status occupation, such as those of the jaguar, the ocelot or other small feline and the crocodile (crocodilus spp.). These latter three appear more related to ritual and economic activity than nutritional needs. Freshwater snails were more an ingredient in the diet of lower status families while deer remains were associated with the elite residents of the city.43
Among Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; and its most important satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of remains from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; the majority were from terrestrial species. 10% of animal remains from Motul had been modified to form artefacts, compared with only 4% of animal remains at Trinidad. Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros were more likely to be waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; they were more likely to be artefacts at the end of their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; were far more likely to be consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.44
History
Preclassic Period
Middle Preclassic
Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; was first settled between 600 and 300 BC, in the latter portion of the Middle Preclassic period, when it was probably a fairly small site. At this time some of its satellite sites were also settled, including La Trinidad de Nosotros and Buena Vista, both of which would have been small villages at this time, and they may have been settled even earlier in the Middle Preclassic, between 800 and 600 BC.45
Late Preclassic
Although investigation of Preclassic remains is difficult at Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; due to the overlying Late Classic construction, it is evident that the site experienced major growth during the Late Preclassic (300 BC–AD 300) and became a sizeable centre. At roughly the same time, most of the major structures were built at Akte, and Chakokot experienced its earliest occupation during the Late Preclassic. In contrast, Buena Vista appears to have been lightly occupied. La Trinidad de Nosotros also underwent major expansion in the Late Preclassic and became larger and more important than Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;, with its architectural layout being finalised in this period - later Classic period construction was superimposed upon pre-existing Late Preclassic structures.46
Classic Period
Although Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; had begun to refer to Tikal as its overlord in the late 4th century,47 by the 7th century various hieroglyphic texts mention that it was under the dominion of Calakmul, Tikal's greatest enemy, before again coming under the power of Tikal in the early 8th century.48
Early Classic
Early Classic ceramic finds are scarce at Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; and those that have been found were a minor component in mixed fill deposits. This suggests that Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; was largely abandoned in the Early Classic. The best examples of Early Classic pottery come from outside of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; itself, with several complete ceramic vessels being recovered during the construction of a modern language school in Trinidad de Nosotros and some fragments of Early Classic pottery being retrieved from a looted chultun at Wakutal.49
In the late 4th century Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; began to refer to Tikal as its overlord.50
Late Classic
Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; experienced its second major peak in occupation during the Late Classic period, between AD 600 and AD 830. Most of the major architecture at the site was built during this surge in activity and the city reached its maximum size. Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; became one of the three most important cities around Lake Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Itz&lt;U+00E1&gt; and was approximately the same size as Tayasal, while it was slightly smaller than Nixtun Ch'ich'. There was renewed growth in the city's satellite sites, Chakokot reached its peak population and most of its residential complexes were built in the Late Classic. Buena Vista experienced only light occupation at this time. Major construction work took place at Akte including the building of the principal platform and its causeway. It also appears that the rulers of Akte erected several stelae. La Trinidad de Nosotros took on its final form and most of its major architecture was built at this time including the Mesoamerican ballcourt, the major residential complexes, four plazas and the port facilities.51
In the 8th century AD the city had important relationships with Maya cities to the southwest, especially in the Petexbat&lt;U+00FA&gt;n region, and on the Pasi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n and Usumacinta rivers, including Seibal (on the Pasi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n), Altar de Sacrificios (near where the Pasi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n becomes the Usumacinta), and Dos Pilas, Aguateca, Tamarindito, Arroyo de Piedra and Cueva de Sangre (all five in the Petexbat&lt;U+00FA&gt;n region).52 It is possible that the widespread distribution of Ik-style ceramics in elite tombs at sites in the Petexbat&lt;U+00FA&gt;n region may be linked to the military defeat of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; by Dos Pilas, with these high quality ceramics forming a part of the tribute payment made to the Petexbat&lt;U+00FA&gt;n kingdom.53 After its defeat at the hands of the Petexbat&lt;U+00FA&gt;n kingdom, Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; no longer erected sculpted stelae but the history of the site continued to be recorded to a certain extent in texts on Ik-style ceramics.54
Politics
 In the Late Classic period Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; was located between two mutually hostile powers, the great city of Tikal to the north and the breakaway kingdom of Petexbat&lt;U+00FA&gt;n to the southwest, which had become a vassal of Tikal's implacable enemy Calakmul. In Mesoamerica, such border states as Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; became centres of political activity as they tried to manipulate the shifting political fortunes of their neighbours to their own advantage. This seems to be the case at Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; with its rich ceramic tradition being a testament to the politically motivated banqueting that took place in the city. In the 8th century, although Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; was the capital of the Ik polity, the aristocracy of its satellite sites wielded great power and were able to challenge their own position within the political hierarchy of the state while remaining subordinate to the ruling lord of the capital city.55
During the 7th century AD, Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; is recorded in hieroglyphic inscriptions as being a vassal of Calakmul. By the early 8th century the city had switched its allegiance to Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, king of Tikal, then falling under the power of Petexbat&lt;U+00FA&gt;n, itself a vassal of Calakmul, in the middle of the 8th century, before once again switching its allegiance to Tikal. In 711, Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, Lord of Tikal, was recorded as overlord of Motul, perhaps reflecting Tikal's traditional overlordship of the city.56 In spite of these shifting alliances, Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; acted with a degree of independence and was a powerful kingdom in the 8th century AD, with its ruler using the kaloomte title given to high kings. The city's rulers became very successful on the political scene in the wider Maya region, with the use of politically motivated feasting, war, economics and political marriages.57
There is a glyphic record that sometime before 731 a lord of Motul was captured by a lord (Ruler B) of Machaquil&lt;U+00E1&gt;.58 In 740, Machaquila attacked Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;.59 Hieroglyphic Stairway 3 at Dos Pilas records that in 745 a lord of Motul was captured by K'awiil Chan K'inich of Dos Pilas.60 In the middle of the 8th century AD, Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; was closely allied with the important city of Yaxchilan on the Usumacinta River, as demonstrated by the fact that the king of Yaxchilan Yaxun B'alam IV (&quot;Bird Jaguar IV&quot;) who ruled from 752 to 768, took two wives from Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; - who are named in inscriptions at Yaxchilan as Lady Wak Tuun and Lady Wak Jalam Chan Ajaw.61 Lady Wak Jalam Chan Ajaw is shown preparing her husband for a battle that took place in 755 on Yaxchilan Lintel 41, now in the British Museum in London.62 In fact, the alliance with Yaxchilan may date further back to the early 8th century since Yaxchilan Lintel 25 (dedicated in AD 723) used the so-called X-ray style of imagery that is closely associated with the Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; polity.63 However, relations with Yaxchilan were not always peaceful and Hieroglyphic Stairway 5 at Yaxchilan records that Itzamnaaj B'alam III of Yaxchilan defeated the lord of Motul some time in the latter part of the 8th century.64

An Ik-style vessel possesses a hieroglyphic text declaring that it was the property of Chuy-ti Chan, the son of Sak Muwaan, divine lord of Motul de San Jose who ruled between AD 700 and 726. Chuy-ti Chan is described as an artist and ballplayer and appears to have been appointed as an ambassador to the site known as Maan.70
Two rulers feature prominently on Ik-style ceramics, they are named as Yajawte' K'inich and Lamaw Ek'. Lamaw Ek' appears to have ruled directly after Yajawte' K'inich but was not his son, on one vessel his father is given the title k'uhul Ik'nal, a &quot;divine noble of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;&quot; but not the king (whose title is k'uhul ajaw or &quot;divine lord&quot;). Each of these two rulers had his own dedicated master painter. The artist of Yajawte' K'inich is named on the ceramics as T'uubal Ajaw, Lord of T'uubal. This latter site, T'uubal, is thought to be located in Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n somewhere between Tikal and Naranjo. Yajawte' K'inich is depicted on one Ik-style vessel wearing a mask and dancing, he is also depicted on Stelae 2 and 6 in the site core. Yajawte' K'inich is recorded on one vessel as possibly having died in AD 755.71
The name of the painter who produced the ceramic vessels for Lamaw Ek' is only partially deciphered, as well as painting the vessel that possibly records the death of Yajawte' K'inich, he also painted a vessel recording the death of Lamaw Ek' as having taken place in AD 779.72
Terminal Classic
Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; underwent a major decline in population at the end of the Classic Period, between AD 830 and AD 1000, and construction also suffered. Terminal Classic ceramics are common but limited to the major centres of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; itself and its principal satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros. Although it declined, construction did not halt. Occupation at Group D in the site core continued while Late Classic structues at La Trinidad de Nosotros were modified in the Terminal Classic. There is little evidence for Terminal Classic occupation at the smaller satellite sites.73
An inscription dating to AD 830 mentions the last known ruler of Machaquil&lt;U+00E1&gt;, which may be evidence of a long standing relationship between the two sites.74 If this is the case, then Machaquil&lt;U+00E1&gt; appears to have been the dominant city out of the two.75 Seibel Stela 10, dating to roughly 849 AD, has an inscription naming Kan Ek' as ruler of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;, which is recorded as being one of the four paramount polities in the mid-9th century (ca. 849), along with Calakmul, Tikal and Seibal itself.76
Itza migration
 It has been suggested that Itza Maya from Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; began the northward migration of Maya peoples to the Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Peninsula at the end of the Classic Period. Classic period stelae at the site refer to the King of the Itz&lt;U+00E1&gt;, demonstrating that the Itza were already in the Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n region at this time.77 The nearby village of San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;, on the shore of Lake Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Itz&lt;U+00E1&gt;, is one of the last Itz&lt;U+00E1&gt; communities in Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n.78
Postclassic Period
The full extent of occupation and activity in the Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; area is not well understood for the Postclassic Period. It is known that there was a moderate occupation of the area during the Early Postclassic period, between AD 1000 and AD 1250. Early Postclassic construction and ceramics have been identified at Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; and all of its satellite sites, but construction was small scale and distribution of pottery was limited. La Trinidad de Nosotros was apparently a small village at this time and has produced some of the best examples of Early Postclassic ceramics.79
There is little evidence of occupation in the Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; area during the Late Postclassic, from AD 1250 to AD 1697. It is possible that La Trinidad de Nosotros was Xililchi, a settlement visited by conquistador Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n de Urs&lt;U+00FA&gt;a after the fall of the Itza capital Noj Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n to the Spanish in 1697, but no Late Postclassic remains have yet been identified by archaeologists.80
Modern history
Teoberto Maler visited Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; in May 1895, and described one of the stelae in his report Explorations in the Department of Peten, Guatemala, published by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology of Harvard University in 1910.81 Ian Graham and Arlen Chase have separately mapped portions of the site core.82
Before the establishment of the Motul Ecological Park, the site was used for agriculture, specifically the cultivation of maize. The site has been damaged several times by wildfires caused by uncontrolled stubble burning in 1986, 1987 and again in 1998. This last fire badly damaged the stelae in the site core.83
In 1998, the mayor of San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; oversaw the improvement of the road to Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;, which involved surfacing the road with gravel and opened the archaeological site to easier access, resulting in increased tourism at the site.84
The Proyecto Arqueol&lt;U+00F3&gt;gico Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; (Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Archaeological Project) has been investigating Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; and its satellites from 1998 to 2008, under the direction of Antonia Foias of Williams College and Kitty Emery of the Florida Museum of Natural History.85 The core of the satellite site of Akte was mapped in 2002 and Trinidad de Nosotros was investigated by the project in 2003.86
Site description

The summit of one of the larger pyramids of Group C, built with thin, flat stones, an architectural style that probably dates it to the Terminal Classic87

Around 230 structures have been mapped in an area covering , however, the total area occupied by the city was probably much greater than this.88 The total size of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; is estimated at , with only about a third of this having been mapped.89 The ceremonial centre of the city covers an area of , an area which encompasses more than 144 structures including a sizeable palace, 6 stelae, 33 plazas of widely differing sizes, and various temples and elite residential areas. Further residential areas of the city cover an additional , which includes both elite and commoner residences, with outlying settlements located for several kilometers to the north and east,90 with one residential group associated with agricultural terraces being situated 2 km to the north of the site.91 In total, 33 plaza groups have been mapped at Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;.92
By 2003, around 1,800 fragments of figurines had been excavated from the site, its periphery and its satellites, with 239 of these being either heads or complete figurines.93
The site can be generally divided into three broad areas, the site core, a North Zone and an East Zone. The North Zone is separated from the site core by a wide depression containing clay soil that may have served as a reservoir for the city. Several quarries have been identified on the northern and southern edges of this depression.94
The major architecture can be divided into five groups, labelled A to E.95 Each of these groups has at least one pyramid and various palace type structures.96 The major residential complexes of the site are found in Groups A, B and D, not including the royal palace in Group C.97 The major architectural groups are divided by lower lying areas that may have been used for intensive agriculture.98 The urban area of the site extends for  around the site core, with this area having been continuously occupied with a full range of structures from elite down to commoner in status.99
Two distinct architectural styles date to the last period of the site's occupation in the Late Classic.100 One uses well-carved stone blocks for construction and is possibly earlier than the second style, which is believed to date to the Terminal Classic and uses thin, flat stones.101
Architectural groups
Group A
Group A is the largest group west of the site core. The group includes a  tall pyramid, severely damaged by looters' pits, with one in the summit and one each on the north, east, south and west sides. IDAEH has since refilled all five pits. Six large rectangular palace-type structures are situated to the west of this pyramid, measuring up to  high. A plaza is formed in Group A by the pyramid on the east side and a palace on the west side, accessed from the plaza via a stairway. Southeast of the palace is another plaza surrounded on three sides by palace-type structures.102
Group B
Group B includes a  high pyramid located about  south of a palace complex laid out around two small plazas.103 The main complex in Group B closely resembles a complex at Dos Pilas in the Petexbat&lt;U+00FA&gt;n region.104 The pyramid has been looted, with the looters' pits having been refilled by IDAEH. The highest structure in the palace complex measures  high and is on the south side of the west plaza, its stairways stylistically resemble stairways from the Petexbat&lt;U+00FA&gt;n.105 The palace complex has been looted, with one of the smaller structures around the east plaza having been completely detsroyed.106
A low wall runs north for  from the northeast corner of the east plaza, it measures between  high and  wide. The wall ends in a platform supporting several structures, it may have divided different parts of the site or marked the edge of an avenue.107
To the north of Group B are several smaller groups of structures.108 They consist of residential complexes laid out around small plazas and their occupation was limited purely to the Late Classic period.109 Stela 2 is situated on a low platform to the west of the main pyramid.110
Group C
Group C is the principal group at Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;.111 It includes the Main Plaza, which is surrounded by pyramids and palaces.112 The tallest pyramid is  high.113 The three largest pyramids in Group C belong to the architectural style possibly dating to the Terminal Classic, being built of thin, flat stones.114 Excavations have revealed that Group C was occupied from around 300 BC, in the Late Preclassic.115
The Main Plaza in Group C measures approximately  and is bordered by the Acropolis on the north and west sides, twin pyramids on the east side and the South Pyramid on the south side.116 It is the largest plaza at Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;, encompassing an area greater than .117 There are five stelae in the plaza commemorating Classic Period rulers, they have all been badly damaged by bushfires.118 On the west side of the plaza is a lower pyramid, measuring  high, that has been damaged by looters. A badly eroded stela was found close to this pyramid, another stela was erected in front of the South Pyramid. All three of the principal pyramids in Group C still support the remains of their summit shrines, possibly even with parts of their roofs and roof combs. The construction of these remaining structures consists of the thin, flat stones associated with the Terminal Classic occupation of the site.119
The Twin Temples were both built on the same platform on the east side of the Main Plaza and have heights of  and , three stelae (Stelae 3, 4 and 5) were erected in front of them in a north-south line. The south pyramid of the two has been somewhat damaged by looters.120 Both of these pyramids probably originally supported roof combs and were accessed by twin stairways rising from the plaza to the west.121
The Acropolis is a palace complex laid out around six small plazas, which it completely encloses, and forms the north side of the Main Plaza.122 It is a massive architectural complex covering an area of more than  and is likely to have been the palace of the royal family.123 Two structures lying immediately to the south of the central plaza within the complex itself measure as high as  and  respectively. Investigations at the northern extreme of the Acropolis uncovered a piece of a plate dated to the Terminal Classic period.124 Excavations in the northwestern portion of tha Acropolis have revealed a series of stucco floors and large amounts of ceramic remains, as well as fragments of worked stone, obsidian, bone and shell. Among the artefacts recovered were three polychrome vessels, two tripod vessels, a flute and a drum. Ceramic remains dated to the Late Classic have been found in all levels of the Acropolis.125 One of the ceramic vessels excavated from the acropolis was in a style associated with Tikal. Investigations behind the west structure of the northwest plaza in the Acropolis recovered fill that included ceramic fragments dating as far back as the Late Preclassic and Early Classic.126
The South Pyramid is the highest structure at the site, measuring  tall. As its name suggests, it forms the south side of the Main Plaza.127 Excavations on the north (plaza) side of this temple uncovered Stela 6.128
Group D
Group D is an elaborate residential complex located to the north of the twin pyramids in Group C and northeast of the Acropolis, like the other groups it consists of various structures laid out around a plaza.129 The group includes two palaces, including one on the west side of the plaza that has been badly damaged by looters.130 A  pyramid is situated on the east side of the Group D plaza. A looters' trench that was cut into the pyramid revealed earlier levels of construction consisting of well made stone blocks,131 archaeological investigation of the looters' tunnel revealed that the looters had probably plundered a high-ranking noble, or royal, tomb.132 Items recovered from the looted tomb included polychrome ceramic fragments, 10 pieces of jade beads, 77 pieces of shell beads, 20 jade mosaic fragments, 145 shell mosaic fragments, 98 pyrite mosaic fragments, a shell necklace and a stingray spine. The human bones in the tomb had been painted red. The presence of the royal tomb suggests either that the palaces in Group D were royal residences or those of the priesthood dedicated to the rituals of the dead king.133
The occupation of Group D dates as far back as the Middle Preclassic period.134 Group D was occupied as late as the Terminal Classic, when a termination ritual was apparently performed, after which the northern building of the group was abandoned. The ritual included scattering a large amount of rubbish in front of the south entrance to the building and then possibly burning the building itself. The rubbish is presumed to have come from the area of Group D itself and included some items associated with weaving and the manufacture of paper.135
The south structure in Group D had a patio with two circular columns, an architectural style that is characteristic of the Terminal Classic period.136
Group E
Group E is the second largest group at Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;, after Group C.137 It is situated to the west of Groups C and D.138 The group includes two pyramids, measuring  and  high, both have been looted and the taller pyramid being located north of the smaller pyramid. Residential groups lie to the south and east of the pyramids, they are made up of three to four rectangular structures laid out around small central plazas, the structures are all less than  high.139
Two palaces investigated in Group E are architecturally quite different from the palaces in Groups C and D. A notable feature is that their doors possess projecting corners. The western structure has a vaulted room with a central bench and also a cross-shaped exterior bench, the walls of the structure still stand  high. The north structure's walls stand  high and its western room had been divided in two by the placement of vertical stone slabs. This north structure did not possess any interior benches. It may be that the different architectural styles of Group E and the other main groups at Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; result from their association with different lineages, each with its own style.140
Group E is distinguished by a  long avenue, known as the North South Avenue, with residential groups on the east side. On the west side the avenue is bordered by a  high wall. The northern end of the avenue terminates at a small temple while the south ends at Plaza B.141
Stelae
 Six stelae are known from Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;, all were found in Group C, with five of them being located in the Main Plaza.142
Stela 1, dating to the 8th century AD, contains the first known mention anywhere of the phrase Itza Chul Ahau (&quot;Divine Lord of the Itza&quot;).143 It is situated on the west side of the Main Plaza in Group C and has the most well preserved hieroglyphic text at the site. The text describes the accession to the throne of a local lord under the supervision of Jasaw Chan K'awiil I of Tikal. Stela 1 also provides the best evidence yet found identifying Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; as the Late Classic Ik polity.144
Stela 2 is situated some distance to the west of the Main Plaza in Group C, in Plaza B, in front of a small temple.145 This stela was photographed by Teoberto Maler in the first decade of the 20th century. The stela depicts king Yajawte' K'inich, it shows dancing figures on its east face.146 On its west face it depicts a figure sculpted using the so-called X-ray style found on Ik-style ceramics, which depicts the face in profile wearing a mask that has been cut away to show the face underneath.147
Stela 3 is located on the east side of the Main Plaza in Group C, north of Stela 4.148
Stela 4 is situated on the east side of the Main Plaza in Group C, near the Twin Temples, just south of Stela 3 and north of Stela 5.149 The stela shows king Yajawte' K'inich performing a dance, with one foot raised.150
Stela 5 is also located on the east side of the Main Plaza, just south of Stela 4.151
Stela 6 is located on the south side of the Main Plaza in Group C, just north of the South Pyramid. It was discovered in 1988 and had been broken into many pieces, although the base of the stela was still in situ. Two other large fragments were lying on the surface and more than 100 smaller fragments were collected. The stela appears to have shattered when it fell, some time after Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; had been abandoned.152 The north and south faces of the stela bore sculpted designs, the remaining butt of the stela has the left foot of a human figure worked in profile on the south side. The sculpture on the north side has been pieced together in part and appears to have shown the figure of a ruler of the city dressed in rich clothing and regalia. The figure was positioned performing a dance, with one foot half lifted off the ground. In his right hand the ruler held a God K sceptre. The prelimanry reconstruction of the sculpture would indicated that the figure of the king measured between  high. Stela 6 is very similar to Stela 1 from Dos Pilas with both depicting the ruler in an identical position. The stela appears to have been a relatively late addition to the plaza and dates to the Late Postclassic period.153

Akte
Akte is situated  northwest of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; and is known for its sculptured monuments.154 The centre of Akte covers an area of  and includes 32 structures on a  high artificially landscaped hill, with a number of other structures scattered through the surrounding area.155 The hill supporting the site core overlooks the rivers Akte and Kantetul.156 The main periods of occupation date to the Late Preclassic and Late Classic with further occupation in the Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic.157 The overall area of Akte is probably larger than that of Trinidad de Nosotros, covering a  area, but this includes less structures than at Trinidad, with small residential groups widely scattered on hilltops around the site core.158
The main residential complex at Akte rests upon a  platform and contains three patios, with other residential groups clustered around the east, south and west side of the platform's base. A small temple is located on the east side of the north patio.159 Akte may have served as a rural administrative centre or perhaps as a royal estate of the Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; elite.160
Seven sculpted monuments have been found at Akte, an unusual number for such a small site. If these monuments were originally erected at Akte, then this may mean that the site was actually outside of the Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; polity. Archaeological investigations of the stelae carried out in 2003 were unable to determine if the monuments had been moved to Akte or not.161
Stela 1 is the best preserved monument at Akte.162 It is badly eroded and can be dated by a damaged Long Count date inscribed on the back, which dates it to the end of the 7th century or the beginning of the 8th.163 The front of the stela bears the representation of a standing &quot;divine lord&quot; with attributes typical of the Late Classic.164
Stela 2 is badly damaged, being broken into a number of fragments.165
Stela 3 had a cache of 44 pieces of obsidian buried near its base.166
Buena Vista
Buena Vista lies  to the southwest of the site core and  from the northwest shore of Lake Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Itz&lt;U+00E1&gt;.167 13 structures have been mapped, situated around a small plaza, with a small temple on the east side.168 The site is located on a hilltop and was once much larger but has been partially covered by the modern development of Nuevo San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;.169 Structures 4 and 8 have been investigated, revealing that Buena Vista was probably occupied from the Middle Preclassic through to the Late Classic, with a much reduced population in the Early Postclassic.170 The site was surveyed in 2000 and preliminary excavations took place in 2001.171 The main pyramids of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; are visible from Buena Vista, as is a large part of the lake.172 Buena Vista has fairly good soil and the surviving portions of the site are currently used for milpa cultivation.173
The earliest ceramic evidence excavated at Buena Vista dates to the very end of the Early Preclassic period, indicating that the site was initially settled at the transition between the Early and Middle Preclassic periods.174 The long occupational history of Buena Vista may be linked to its proximity to chert-rich hills. Excavations have revealed evidence of chert workshops dedicated to the production of tools, together with dumps of waste flakes.175
Buena Vista features an early architectural style that differs from that at Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;, consisting of platforms built from unworked stone, with wide front stairways and probably without superstructures. They were built in the Middle to Late Preclassic periods and then reused in the Late Classic. The differences in style between Buena Vista and Motul probably results from differing epochs of construction.176
Group A is arranged around the main plaza.177 Group B is located a little to the southeast,178 and contains structures 11 to 14.179
Structure 1 is the East Pyramid, it is located on the hillside a short distance from the rest of the mounds.180 It was a  high Late Classic funerary structure containing a looted tomb.181 From the summit of this temple both Lake Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Itz&lt;U+00E1&gt; and the Twin Temples of Group C at Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; are visible.182
Structure 4 is the North Structure.183 It dates to the Late Classic but overlies construction dating to the Middle Preclassic.184 A stairway ascended the front of the building, under which were found the remains of Late Classic polychrome ceramics, perhaps belonging to a pre-construction ritual offering.185 The stucco floors on top of the mound supported asymmetric walls that perhaps date to the Postclassic Period, being associated with a mix of Late Classic and Postclassic pottery.186
Structures 7, 8 and 9 were long, low rectangular platforms.187 They measure  long by  wide and  high.188 They had perishable roofs and date to the Late Classic, although Structures 7 and 8 may overlie Middle Preclassic remains.189
Chachaklum
Chachaklum (also spelt Ch&lt;U+00E4&gt;ch&lt;U+00E4&gt;klu'um) is situated  east of the site core and may also have formed a part of the Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; polity.190 It is a large site covering over , an area that includes over 141 structures. Chachaklum includes a small ceremonial centre where a possible E-Group has been identified. The site is located in an area of savanna with poor soils considered unsuitable for the growing of maize, somewhat at odds with the settlement density of the site. The contrast between the settlement density and poor soils has highlighted the need for further research into Maya agriculture in a savanna environment.191 Chachaklum was a relatively large site of secondary rank within the Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; polity.192
Chachaklum's principal phase of occupation appears to date to the Terminal Classic period, during the 10th and 11th centuries AD. However, the site possesses massive basal platforms and these, together with the presence of the E-Group, suggests a longer occupational period than was immediately evident from the first excavations of the site. Further investigations have revealed a long occupational history beginning in the Late Preclassic period and continuing right through to the Late Classic.193
Chak Maman Tok' (La Estrella)
Chak Maman Tok' is a very small site located  southwest of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; and about  from Buena Vista. The site includes a small number of mounds spread along the hillside overlooking Lake Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Itz&lt;U+00E1&gt;. The site was investigated by archaeologists in 2005 and 2006. Although the site is very small, it seems to have been an important centre for the production of high-quality chert tools, and one of the major manufacturers of chert tools in the Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n lowlands with considerable economic importance within the Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; polity.194
The site has been severely damaged by modern construction with the chert deposits being reused as construction material.195
Chakokot
Chakokot is located  to the east of the Main Plaza.196 It occupies an area of  and consists of 59 structures widely dispersed around a small plaza upon the flat summit of a  high hill.197 Principal occupation dates from the Late Preclassic and Late Classic periods.198 The soils at Chakokot are considered good for agriculture and maize was grown within the site itself. The area between Chakokot and Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; is occupied by a bajo, or low-lying seasonal swamp.199
The Plaza at Chakokot is small and covers an area of about . On the north and east sides it is bordered by residential groups, a  square platform is to the south and on the west by two low parallel structures measuring just  high.200
The largest structure at Chakokot is a  tall temple to the east of a large residential area bordering the Plaza on the east side.201
Most of the residential areas at Chakokot possess one or more bottle-shaped underground storage chambers, known as chultunob, with 14 having been found as of 2001. Because of the thick vegetation at the site, investigators consider that there are probably more to be found. These chultunob were closed with disc-shaped stone lids, many of which were found either still in place or close to the aperture of the chultun to which it belonged. The stone lids were without perforations so it is supposed that the chambers were used to store dry goods rather than water.202
Kantetul
Kantetul is located  north of the site core.203
Ox Ool
Ox Ool is located in the hill country a few kilometers south of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;, and has fertile soil for agriculture.204
Tikalito
Tikalito is located in the hills a few kilometers north-northwest of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;, and possesses rich soils for agriculture.205
La Trinidad de Nosotros
La Trinidad is known as ''Sik'u' '' in the Itza language. It is located  southeast of Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; on the northern shore of Lake Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Itz&lt;U+00E1&gt;.206 The site is located at the closest point to Motul on the lake shore and it may have served as a Maya port.207 The site has more than 115 structures located in an area of , and the site may actually cover  and contain about 150 structures.208 The site had a long occupational history stretching right through from the Middle Preclassic to the Early Postclassic, with two phases of greater activity in the Early Classic around AD 350 and in the Late Classic from AD 650–830.209 The Terminal Classic occupation was largely limited to the lake shore but was fairly dense.210 The monumental architecture, port and the ballcourt all identify La Trinidad de Nosotros as an important secondary centre within the Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; polity.211 Additionally, the site was situated close to a source of chert and probably manufactured chert tools.212
La Trinidad de Nosotros has been tentatively identified as Xililchi, a settlement visited by conquistador Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n de Urs&lt;U+00FA&gt;a after Spanish Conquest of the Itza capital Noj Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n in 1697, but no Late Postclassic remains have yet been securely identified.213
The site is divided into two areas.214 The site core is located on a hill  above the lake and with a good view across it.215 The second area is spread along the lake shore and the hillside leading to the site core.216 The site core has at least 80 structures arranged around five plazas.217 The majority of the structures are residential in nature but La Trinidad has an unusual amount of ceremonial architecture for such a small site.218 La Trinidad seems to have been an important port for the import and export of goods to and from Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;.219
Group C is the main residential complex of the site, it has a small shrine at the eastern end.220 La Trinidad de Nosotros has five main plazas within its site core, labelled I through to V. All of them were resurfaced multiple times between the Late Preclassic and Late Classic. The combined surface areas of the five plazas cover over , with Plaza V making up about half of this, making it slightly smaller than the main plaza at Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; itself.221
Structure A-1 is the main temple, it is a  high radial pyramid.222
Structure C-1 is an elite residence.223
Structure E-1 may originally have been a circular building.224
Structure G-1 is a sub-elite residence.225 The ballcourt is located in Group F.226 It is in the form of a T-shape, with  long sides, a closed northern end zone and a small temple adjoining the eastern side.227 The last phase of construction dates to the Late Classic.228 The ballcourt is similar in design to the ballcourt on the Main Plaza of Dos Pilas in the Petexbat&lt;U+00FA&gt;n region.229 No ballcourt has been identified at the Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; site itself, making the presence of one here of especial interest.230 Rich deposits were found associated with the ballcourt, including 21,000 potsherds, 239 pieces of obsidian, 155 fragments of ceramic figurines and 84 stone tools.231
Group O is a small residential group to the west of Plaza V.232
Various structures have been identified in the area of the port, including retaining walls, a possible breakwater and a quay.233 The port appears to have been partially enclosed by an artificial peninsula.234
