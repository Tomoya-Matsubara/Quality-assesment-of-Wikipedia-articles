Lieutenant Colonel David Cossgrove (1852 - 1920) served in the South African War with Robert Baden-Powell, founder of Scouts and Guides in the United Kingdom. Cossgrove (also spelled Cosgrove1 and Crosgrove2 Dictionary of New Zealand Biography Cossgrove, David  on official documents) took Baden-Powell's ideas back to New Zealand with him and began similar programmes in Christchurch.3
Life and Death
Cossgrove arrived in Port Chalmers, Dunedin on the Alpine which sailed from Glasgow June 10th 1859 and arrived at Otago on September 12th 1859 with his father, James, mother and 3 brothers.4 Alpine 1859 from Otago Witness September 1859  Mr Cosgrove taught at Sandymount school on the Otago Peninsula between 1874 and 1880. He is attributed to a rising roll and introducing elementary science to the curriculum.5 While teaching at Sandymount, he married Selina/Celina Robertson in the February of 1875 in the Otago Peninsular Parish, Dunedin. 6 Otago Peninsular Parish Marriages  7 Dictionary of New Zealand Biography Cossgrove, David  Reports have been made of his student teacher capacity at East Teieri School 8 Dictionary of New Zealand Biography Cossgrove, David , however no record can be found of this. 9 If 'Uncle David' (see section 2) is David Cossgrove, it can be assumed he moved on to teaching at another Dunedin school (after leaving Sandymount) in the early part of the 1880s. He was in Westport by 1888 where he took the physical education class at Westport Girls' State School and ran the Naval Cadet Company at Westport Boys' State School. 10
By his recruitment for the South African War (1900), the Cossgroves were residing in Tuahiwi 11 where David was headmaster of St. Stephen's school (also known as Kaiapoi Native School12 Dictionary of New Zealand Biography - Cossgrove, David  and Tuahiwi School 13), Christchurch, where, in 1902, there were 28 boys and 201 girls. 14 15 Christchurch City Libraries - Heritage Photograph Collection  He stayed headmaster of the school from 1899 - 1914 and it was there where he founded the Scouting movement in New Zealand. 16 He was an important community figure as, not only was he the headmaster of the local school, he also dispatched the daily post from 1900 when a Post Office was established at the school house. 17
It is known that the Cossgrove had a daughter, Muriel, who asked for a girl's equivalent to Scouts (for more information see GirlGuiding New Zealand18) and another source lists three older daughters named Catherine, Selina and Elfrida. 19 Dictionary of New Zealand Biography - Cossgrove, David 
Cossgrove died on 9 September 1920 of stomach cancer and received one of the largest military funerals ever held in Canterbury. 20 Dictionary of New Zealand Biography - Cossgrove, David  He is buried in Bromley cemetery, Caterbury, New Zealand.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.teara.govt.nz/Places/Canterbury/CanterburyPlaces/9/ENZ-Resources/Biography/1/en&gt; Te Ara - Caterbury Places 
Uncle David
A series of articles were printed in the Otago Witness under the name of Uncle David. These took the format of a Natural History Column entitled: &quot;Notes for the Young&quot; followed by various plants and birds described in a fashion suitable for children. 21. These articles continued throughout the early 1880s and are attributed to David Cossgrove. 22 Dictionary of New Zealand Biography Cossgrove, David 
The South African War
Cossgrove was a quartermaster for the 6th New Zealand Contingent. 23 The contingent were sailed to East London for training on 13 January 1901 on the Cornwall under the command of Lieutenant Colonel J.H. Banks.24. They were dispatched to South Africa soon after arrival in London, despite the lack of basic supplies such as rifles, revolvers, ammunition, picks, shovels, axes, water buckets and bandoleers. Cossgrove took the men round East London before they travelled to try and do something about the situation. Making the best of the resources around them: they bought up the empty wine bottles from various hotels to use for water!25
Cossgrove served in Cape Colony, Orange Free State and Transvaal in both 1901 and 1902 as a volunteer serviceman after receiving a second commission as part of the 10th New Zealand Contingent (South Island Regiment), of which he was the Captain and Paymaster. 26 He was granted the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in 1910 and was awarded the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration, the Imperial Volunteer Forces Medal, the New Zealand Long and Eficient Service Medal and is on the New Zealand Volunteers and Retired list as a Captain and Major. 27

A Cosgrove Road exists in Kaiapoi, however this was named after an Eva Cosgrove in 1982 and no link is known to connect this road to David Cossgrove, despite its locality.28
