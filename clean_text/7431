Mark Sanchez (born November 11, 1986 in ) is a college football quarterback attending the University of Southern California (USC). Sanchez has announced that he plans to forgo his final year of college eligibility and enter the 2009 NFL Draft; he plans to continue as a USC student and finish his degree in the Spring of 2009 while preparing for the draft.1
Sanchez was born and raised in Southern California.2 As a high school quarterback, he was named &quot;Player of the Year&quot; by several major college recruiting services and was considered the top quarterback in the nation coming out of high school in 2005.3 He chose to attend USC, where he rose to starting quarterback his redshirt junior season.4 As a third-generation Mexican-American, Sanchez found himself thrust into the spotlight as a symbol of Mexican-American identity and a role model for children.5 In his single season as the starting quarterback, Sanchez led the Trojans to a 12–1 season and No. 2 ranking in the Coaches Poll and No. 3 in the AP Poll, while capturing the 2009 Rose Bowl Offensive Most Valuable Player award.67 After initially showing interest in staying for his final season of eligibility, he became the first USC quarterback since 1990 to leave school early to enter to the NFL Draft.8
High school career
Sanchez attended Santa Margarita Catholic High School for two years. His first pass attempt in high school, as a sophomore, was a 55-yard touchdown completion. While at Santa Margarita, he served as ball boy for future USC Heisman Trophy winner and future NFL quarterback Carson Palmer.9 He then transferred to Mission Viejo High School to play for his high school quarterback guru, Bob Johnson; Johnson, father of former USC and NFL quarterback Rob Johnson, was also the private coach for Palmer.101112 At Mission Viejo he threw for 2,600 yards, 29 touchdowns, and only four interceptions as a junior. With a 75 percent completion rate, he rushed for 90 yards and had a receiving touchdown on a reverse throwback. Sanchez was named a first team all-league, county, and CIF selection. Sanchez carried a 3.7 GPA, and was the president of the student government and captain of the basketball team.13 As a senior, Sanchez completed 114 of 186 passes for 1,746 yards, 16 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, leading his team to a state championship.14 With Sanchez as quarterback, the Mission Viejo Diablos went 27–1.15
In 2004, Sanchez was named high school &quot;Player of the Year&quot; by several major college recruiting services; he was considered the top quarterback in the nation coming out of high school in 2005.16 He participated in the 2005 U.S. Army All-American Bowl. Sanchez was aggressively recruited by several college programs, including Texas, Notre Dame, Nebraska and Ohio State; ultimately he chose USC in the summer before his senior year.17 Several factors influenced Sanchez decision: he considered Palmer his idol and wanted to follow in his footsteps at USC; the campus allowed him to stay close to his family; and he wanted to play for Pete Carroll, whose system used a sophisticated, pro-style offense that highlights a quarterback's athleticism and decision-making ability.18
College career
2005
 Sanchez was well regarded upon his arrival at USC.19 He did not play during his freshman year, and instead took a redshirt season. During this time he participated as the quarterback of USC's scout team, earning the Trojans' Service Team Offensive Player of the Year Award.
2006
For the 2006 season, Sanchez competed for the starting position; however, once junior John David Booty underwent back surgery after the first day of spring practice, Sanchez ran the first-team offense during the spring as Booty recuperated. Coaches stated Booty would be regarded as the starting quarterback when he returned for fall training camp.20
In April 2006, Sanchez was arrested after a female USC student accused him of sexual assault.2122 He was released from jail the following day, after posting $200,000 bail, but USC placed him on interim suspension that suspended him from the football team yet permitted him to take his semester finals, albeit separate from the general student body and under the supervision of campus security.23 On June 3, 2006, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office announced no charges would be filed against Sanchez due to a &quot;lack of sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;, noting the case was &quot;essentially a 'one-on-one' allegation.&quot;2425 The District Attorney's office released the charge evaluation worksheet that said the alleged victim in the case said she consented to kissing and petting on Sanchez's bed, and that she repeatedly refused Sanchez's advances to have intercourse with her but continued the other activities with him when he complied; the woman later spent time with other students without mentioning an incident and later told her mother who reportedly called police later in the morning.2627 The woman involved left the university.28 Sanchez was required to take a rape awareness class at USC.29 USC reinstated Sanchez but he remained subject to team-related discipline for underage drinking and using fake identification on the night he was arrested.30 Sanchez had been previously detained but not arrested by USC's Department of Public Safety for allegedly breaking a window at a fraternity party.31
As a redshirt freshman, Sanchez served as the back-up quarterback to Booty, seeing playing time in three games. He passed for 63 yards and no touchdowns with one interception.32
2007
 In fall practice before the 2007 season, Sanchez broke the thumb in his throwing hand, missing the first game against Idaho; he returned the following week and the redshirt sophomore again served as the primary backup to senior John David Booty. Mid-season, Sanchez was moved up to starting quarterback for the game against Arizona after Booty suffered a broken finger in his throwing hand during a 24–23 upset loss to Stanford.33
On October 13, Sanchez led USC to a 20–13 victory, overcoming a shaky first half where he threw two key interceptions, allowing Arizona to tie the game going into halftime. During the second half, Sanchez completed 11 of 15 passes for 74 yards and a touchdown and had a key 10-yard run for a first down, ultimately finishing the game 19 for 31 passing with 130 yards and averaged 4.2 yards a play for one touchdown, two interceptions, and was sacked three times.34 With Booty still recovering, USC elected to start Sanchez for a second straight week, this time at Notre Dame; he made significant improvements, completing 21 of 38 passes for 235 yards and four touchdowns and no interceptions.35 On October 27, Sanchez started for the final time in place of the injured Booty, at an away game against Oregon. The game resulted in a 24–17 defeat for USC, with Sanchez having two passes intercepted by Oregon safety Matthew Harper in the second half. The first interception led to a fourth-quarter touchdown that gave Oregon a 14 point lead; the second interception ended USC's final chance for a comeback.36 He publicly accepted the blame for the loss.37
The following week, against Oregon State, Booty returned as USC's starting quarterback, with Sanchez resuming his position as Booty's backup.38 Sanchez passed for 695 yards and seven touchdowns with five interceptions over the season.39
2008
 Sanchez entered spring practice before the 2008 season as the front-runner to take over the starting quarterback position, but faced strong competition from Arkansas-transfer and former Razorback starter Mitch Mustain and redshirt freshman Aaron Corp; Mustain, like Sanchez a year earlier, was the top quarterback in the nation coming out of high school in 2006.40414243 By the end of spring practice, the USC coaching staff announced that Sanchez would be the designated starting quarterback going into fall camp.44454647 During the first week of fall camp, Sanchez suffered a dislocated left kneecap while warming up for practice; trainers were able to immediately put the kneecap back into place.48 After missing nearly three weeks, Sanchez was cleared to play in the opener against Virginia on the final scrimmage of fall camp.4950 Before the opener, Sanchez was contacted by USC's previous three quarterbacks under Carroll --Palmer, Matt Leinart and Booty-- who wished him well and offered general advice.51
In the opener at Virginia, Sanchez threw for a career-best 338 yards, making 26 of 35 pass attempts for three touchdowns and one interception.52 The Davey O'Brien Foundation named him the O'Brien Quarterback of the Week and his performance garnered early Heisman consideration.5354 With Sanchez starting all 13 games at quarterback, the Trojans ended the season 12–1 and ranked No. 2 in the Coaches Poll and No. 3 in the AP Poll.55 Sanchez won the 2009 Rose Bowl Offensive MVP of the game; his 413 passing yards ranked fourth in Trojans history and were the highest since Carson Palmer threw for 425 against Notre Dame in 2002. He finished the season with 34 scoring passes, second in school history behind Matt Leinart's 38 in 2003.56 Sanchez ended his redshirt junior season with 3,207 yards passing, 34 touchdowns and 10 interceptions.57
After the Rose Bowl, Sanchez said it would be &quot;hard&quot; to leave USC for the NFL and &quot;probably couldn't do it; he would have entered his redshirt senior year if he had stayed. However, with the subsequent announcement that other NFL-caliber quarterbacks, such as Sam Bradford, Tim Tebow and Colt McCoy, had decided to stay in school for their senior seasons, rumors arose that Sanchez would use the opportunity to be one of the first two quarterbacks selected in the 2009 NFL Draft.585960 On January 15, Sanchez announced his plans to forgo his final year of college eligibility and enter the 2009 NFL Draft; he plans to continue as a USC student and finish his degree in the Spring of 2009 while preparing for the draft.6162 During the press conference, Carroll made it clear that he did not agree with Sanchez' decision, and that he advised him of the low success-rate of quarterbacks who left the college game early to enter the NFL.63 Despite the public disagreement, the two remained close afterward.64 Sanchez was the first USC quarterback to turn pro before exhausting his eligibility since Todd Marinovich did so after the 1990 season.65
Sanchez selected his older brother and business litigator, Nick Sanchez, to be his agent.66 He was one of twelve USC players invited to the 2009 NFL Scouting Combine.67
Personal
 Sanchez is a third-generation Mexican-American.68 Sanchez' great-grandfather, Nicholas Sanchez, was born in Zacatecas, Mexico; he later moved to south Texas and, in 1911, to California's Central Valley where he and his wife worked as fruit pickers and raising a family of six children.69 Nicholas Sanchez settled in the Palo Verde section of Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez Ravine, but was displaced when the government cleared the land for public housing, only to build Dodger Stadium.70 Another of Sanchez' great-grandparents, Pedro Moreno of Jalisco, moved to Bisbee, Arizona and became a successful real estate investor before moving to Los Angeles with his wife and 16 children in 1925. Nicholas Sanchez' son Jorge and Moreno's daughter Juanita married and started a family; Jorge, a World War II veteran, was an aeronautics technician and the family lived in public housing until moving to a house in a predominantly African-American neighborhood in South Los Angeles. Jorge and Juanita's youngest son, Nick, married Olga, one of the few Mexican-Americans in a Jewish part of East Los Angeles and had three children before divorcing when Mark Sanchez was 4; Mark and his brothers stayed with their dad but their mother remained involved in their upbringing and eventually moved back to the same town.71
His father, Nick, is a fire captain in Orange County, California; in college, Nick Sanchez played quarterback for East Los Angeles College.7273 Mark Sanchez initially grew up in Whittier and Pico Rivera; when he was six his father moved with the kids to Rancho Santa Margarita, a predominantly Caucasian neighborhood of Orange County.74 His father remarried and raised them under firm discipline that called on them to be leaders and communicators.75 His two older brothers both played college football: Nick Jr. attended Yale University where he played quarterback (1992–94); Brandon attended DePauw University where he played on the offensive line.76 Nick Jr. went on to attend the USC Law School and is a business attorney.77 When Mark Sanchez changed high schools, the family moved to a rental house in Mission Viejo.78 In between seasons at USC, Sanchez worked as a sous chef at Phil Trani's, a Long Beach restaurant.79
Mexican-American identity



&quot;Some people wanted me to be the Latino quarterback. Some people wanted me to be the USC quarterback who happens to be Latino. [I decided to] just be me and do my best with everything and not try to be something I'm not.&quot;


&lt;U+2014&gt; Mark Sanchez on the challenge of being a role model80



When Sanchez was elevated to prominence at USC, he found himself a symbol of Mexican-American identity and a role model for children.8182 Being at USC put him in the center of the spotlight in Los Angeles, a metropolitan area populated with more than 4.6 million Latinos, three-quarters of whom are Mexican.83 He began getting attention from the media in Mexico.84 While there had been previous, successful Mexican-American quarterbacks such as Jim Plunkett, Joe Kapp, Jeff Garcia, and Tony Romo, unlike his predecessors, Sanchez was a third-generation, full-blooded Mexican-American.85 USC fans began playing up Sanchez' ethnicity by wearing items such as sarapes, lucha libre masks and homemade &quot;&lt;U+00A1&gt;Viva Sanchez!&quot; T-shirts.8687 His rise to fame within the Mexican-American community was compared to that of boxer Oscar De La Hoya and baseball pitcher Fernando Valenzuela.8889
During his first two games as a starter in 2007, Sanchez wore a custom-made mouthpiece that featured the colors of the Mexican flag in honor of his heritage.9091 Although little noticed during his first game against Arizona, it became a prominent issue after his nationally-televised game against Notre Dame.92 An item that Sanchez wore because he thought it was &quot;cool&quot; became a symbol for two opposing viewpoints: for Mexican-Americans, it was a symbol of solidarity&lt;U+2014&gt;Sanchez publicly accepting his roots; for detractors, the gesture symbolized radical activism.939495 Sanchez, who was born and raised in the U.S., reportedly received letters urging him to go back to Mexico.96 Sanchez himself stated, &lt;U+201C&gt;It&lt;U+2019&gt;s not a Mexican power thing or anything like that. It&lt;U+2019&gt;s just a little bit of pride in our heritage. Hopefully, it inspires somebody and it&lt;U+2019&gt;s all for the best.&lt;U+201D&gt;97 Surprised by the attention and shying away from politics, Sanchez stopped wearing the mouthpiece, but began participating in other efforts to benefit the Latino community.9899
Sanchez, who knew how to speak some Spanish but was not bilingual going into his junior season at USC, began taking Spanish lessons so he could do interviews with the Spanish-language media without a translator.100101 He began speaking to high school kids from predominantly Mexican East Los Angeles.102 The USC band began to play &quot;El Matador&quot;, a 1993 song by Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, when Sanchez would take the field.103 He participated in programs which provides school supplies to first-graders in heavily Latino areas of Long Beach and the South Bay, and joined L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa in distributing holiday gifts to needy families.104 By the end of his USC career, he had been hailed as a significant role model for Latino youth in America.105
