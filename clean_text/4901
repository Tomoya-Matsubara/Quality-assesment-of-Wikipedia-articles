Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk's signature
 During the initial years of the Turkish Republic and under the reforms of Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk, a Latin-based alphabet was introduced to replace the Perso-Turkic script then in use. As part of the reforms, Turkish citizens were also required to take up a last name under the Surname Law in 1934. Prior to this, Turkey's Christian and Jewish citizens were already using surnames, but Muslims did not use surnames. Muslims were generally referred by their social or professional titles such as &quot;Pasha&quot;, &quot;Hoca&quot;, &quot;Bey&quot;, &quot;Han&lt;U+0131&gt;m&quot;, &quot;Efendi&quot;, or their names were complemented with that of their father.rk's signature came from hand of Armenian-Turkish master&quot; /&gt;rk'&lt;U+00FC&gt;n imzas&lt;U+0131&gt;n&lt;U+0131&gt;n &lt;U+00F6&gt;yk&lt;U+00FC&gt;s&lt;U+00FC&gt;&quot; /&gt; Mustafa Kemal himself was required to take up a surname, and the Turkish Parliament gave him the surname Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk, meaning father of the Turks.rk's signature came from hand of Armenian-Turkish master&quot; /&gt;rk'&lt;U+00FC&gt;n imzas&lt;U+0131&gt;n&lt;U+0131&gt;n &lt;U+00F6&gt;yk&lt;U+00FC&gt;s&lt;U+00FC&gt;&quot; /&gt; Many members of parliament, including some of &lt;U+00C7&gt;er&lt;U+00E7&gt;iyan's former students, suggested that Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk needed a new signature for his name. On a November morning in 1934, members of parliament presented the proposal to &lt;U+00C7&gt;er&lt;U+00E7&gt;iyan, who accepted the task.rk's signature came from hand of Armenian-Turkish master&quot; /&gt;rk'&lt;U+00FC&gt;n imzas&lt;U+0131&gt;n&lt;U+0131&gt;n &lt;U+00F6&gt;yk&lt;U+00FC&gt;s&lt;U+00FC&gt;&quot; /&gt; That night, five model signatures were prepared and the following morning, police officers arrived to collect them.rk's signature came from hand of Armenian-Turkish master&quot; /&gt;rk'&lt;U+00FC&gt;n imzas&lt;U+0131&gt;n&lt;U+0131&gt;n &lt;U+00F6&gt;yk&lt;U+00FC&gt;s&lt;U+00FC&gt;&quot; /&gt; Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk personally selected the one of &quot;K. Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk&quot; from these five model signatures.4
Legacy
According to Hagop &lt;U+00C7&gt;er&lt;U+00E7&gt;iyan's son Dikran &lt;U+00C7&gt;er&lt;U+00E7&gt;iyan, after the death of Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk in 1938, his father's contribution to Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk's signature risked being forgotten: &quot;Some tried to introduce others as the creator of the signature. There were efforts to forget my father. But the truth always come[s] to the surface&quot;.rk's signature came from hand of Armenian-Turkish master&quot; /&gt;
