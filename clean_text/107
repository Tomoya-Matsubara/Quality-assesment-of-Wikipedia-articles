Biography
Jeanne Betancourt was born and raised in Burlington, Vermont.1 She lived across from a dairy farm and spent much of her time, as she put it, &quot; &lt;U+201C&gt;helping&lt;U+201D&gt; in the barns and hanging out in the big farm kitchen with our Swedish neighbors&quot;.2 During her childhood, she never considered being an author. She studied tap-dancing and wanted to dance when she grew up. Then she moved to New York, where she finished school, began teaching, and earned a degree in film from New York University.3 After a few years of teaching junior high and high school, she wrote her first novel and soon became a full time author.
She currently lives either on the top floor of a sixteen-story building near the American Museum of Natural History in New York City or in her home in Connecticut. In her free time she draws, paints, and reads. She still loves to dance.
Television
Betancourt has written numerous scripts for television, garnering the National Psychological Award for Excellence in the Media, two Humanities citations, and six Emmy Award nominations.
