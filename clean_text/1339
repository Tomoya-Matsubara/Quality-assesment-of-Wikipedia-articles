is a Japanese visual novel developed by Key and released on June 4 1999. The original version, first available on the PC, contains content of a sexual nature, though a version without this content was released on January 7 2000 for the PC. Subsequent clean versions were sold playable on the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable. The adult and all-ages PC versions were re-released with added support for Windows 2000/XP under the name Kanon Standard Edition.
The gameplay in Kanon follows a linear plotline where the player interacts at pre-determined times to choose several options that appear on the monitor. The game was developed so that the focus for the player would be an intricate plot and the appeal of the five female main characters. The title is generally believed to be derived from the musical term canon; the second TV adaptation plays on this association by using of Pachelbel's Kanon D-dur, or Canon in D, as a background piece at certain instances throughout the series.
Kanon has made several transitions to other media. There are two anime adaptations, the first being a thirteen episode TV series that first aired on January 30 2002, which includes one episode of an OVA, Kazahana, released on May 3 2003, both by the animation studio Toei Animation. The second anime adaptation, created by Kyoto Animation, aired in Japan between October 5 2006 and March 15 2007, containing 24 episodes. The story was also adapted into novels, drama CDs, and a manga series.
Kanon's popularity outside of Japan can be signified by the fans' efforts, such as those in South Korea and China, to release unofficial translated versions to the public.1
Plot
Kanon's story, set in the middle of winter, regards a group of five girls who are connected back to the same boy. Yuichi Aizawa, the main protagonist, had visited the city where the story takes place seven years prior to the story's beginning.
In the beginning Yuichi is very detached from the city and its inhabitants. Prior to his return, it is decided that he is to stay with his cousin, Nayuki Minase, and her mother, Akiko. After his long absence, Yuichi has forgotten all but minor details of what happened seven years before and is in need of being reminded of what he left behind.
On the day after Yuichi's return, he is out with Nayuki who is showing him around town. Nayuki remembers that she has to buy things for dinner and Yuichi is reluctant to go with her, arguing that he might get lost. Moments after Nayuki left him waiting on the sidewalk, a strange girl named Ayu Tsukimiya barges into him with little warning. Upon recovering, she drags him away to a nearby caf&lt;U+00E9&gt; and confesses to inadvertently stealing a bag filled with taiyaki after being accidentally scared away by the salesman before she had a chance to pay. Yuichi then drags Ayu back to the salesman, they both apologize for the trouble, and Ayu is forgiven. They decide to meet up again another day and Ayu scampers off.
Yuichi is not aware at first, but three other girls which he had forgotten are familiar with him. Throughout the story, as he learns about the supernatural undertones of the town, Yuichi is reminded of each girl and the events of seven years ago in the city covered in snow.
Setting and themes
 There are several important locations featured in the Kanon story that are based on those of the Moriguchi city in Japan.2 Key have consistently used real world locations as inspiration for their game settings which occurred with their later game Air. The location names are seldomly mentioned explicitly in their works.
The time of year the story occurred in was during winter, and since it often snowed periodically over the course of the entire story, the city was always presented covered in a layer of snow. The covering snow helps to develop the mysterious mood that the story flows through.
There are recurring themes that appear throughout the story. A music theme is present, as the name of the series is generally believed to be based on a classical composition named Canon in D. The episode titles from the 2006 anime remake have parts in their titles related to music, such as overture and introit. Another theme is the presence of snow around the entire city which helps to develop a mysterious mood coupled with a supernatural theme which the story revolves around. Furthermore, miracles play a large part in the story; Kanon's plotline and characters are influenced by various instances where miracles occur.3 The act of promising and keeping promises is found throughout the story.4 Yuichi eventually makes important promises to the five main girls while at the same time fulfilling past promises he had made with them when he used to visit the city as a kid.
One of the sub-themes in the story is amnesia, or the loss of memory; three of the main characters - Yuichi, Ayu and Makoto - are presented to suffer a form of amnesia in varying degrees, used as a plot device to advance the story. Another sub-theme deals with the favorite foods of the five main heroines. Newtype USA stated in an article on Kanon that, &quot;it's when the characters are eating something really tasty that they seem most beautiful and alive,&quot; despite the somber setting and overall tone of the series.5 These five foods of choice are: taiyaki (Ayu), strawberries (Nayuki), nikuman (Makoto), ice cream (Shiori), and gyudon (Mai).
Gameplay
 The gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent on simply reading the text that will appear on the screen, signifying that a dialogue has occurred. In the original release, there was no voice acting for the characters, but in the later versions ported for the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2, full-voice acting was included in order to heighten the experience.6 The only exception was Yuichi Aizawa who was not voiced in either version. This was later changed with the PlayStation Portable release with Yuichi being voiced by Tomokazu Sugita.7 Every so often, the player will come to a &quot;decision point&quot; where he or she is given the chance to choose from usually two to four options that are displayed on the screen. During these times, gameplay pauses until a choice is made that furthers the plot in a specific direction, depending on which choice the player makes. There are five main plotlines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. In order to view the five plotlines to their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices during the decision points to further the plot in an alternate direction.
One of the goals of the original version's gameplay was for the player to enable viewing of several H scenes depicting Yuichi and one of the five heroines having sexual intercourse. While the original intention of Kanon was to contain these scenes, this comprised ten percent of the entire game's scenes. Key's objective was for the player to focus on the story and characters themselves, as opposed to ultimately finishing each of the separate storylines in order to view the sex scenes.
Console ports
For the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 console ports of Kanon new material was added to make up for the removal of the H-scenes. A new heroine with her own story named Rumi Nanase was included.8 Rumi appeared in the background of some scenes at school in the original game, but she did not interact with anyone. Rumi was taken from the visual novel One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e which was made by the same team that made Kanon, though this was while working with Tactics. Rumi is in the same class as Yuichi which is how they meet.
Characters

Main characters

The girls of Kanon: Mai (top-left), Nayuki (top-center), Shiori (top-right), Makoto (bottom-left), and Ayu (bottom-right).



Yuichi is a seventeen year-old high school student and the male protagonist of the series. In the game, Yuichi is the role that the player assumes. Voiced by: Atsushi Kisaichi (2002 anime), Tomokazu Sugita (2006 anime/PSP game), Miwa Yasuda (Young Yuichi)




Ayu is a short, strange, and mysterious girl who literally bumps into Yuichi early in the story. She is immediately recognizable by her winged backpack, red headband, and tendency to refer to herself with the masculine first-person pronoun . She has a fondness for eating taiyaki and is left-handed. 




Nayuki is a girl of Yuichi's age, and she is his first cousin; he moves into her house at the beginning of the story. She has always been in love with him and must learn how to deal with her feelings, especially with the threat that he may fall for one of the other girls. Nayuki talks noticeably slower than those around her and has constant trouble waking up in the mornings.




Makoto is a young girl who attacks Yuichi out-of-the-blue in the middle of town early on in the story. She has lost her memories but despite this she is sure that she holds a grudge against Yuichi from when he last visited the city. Makoto has a mischievous side and constantly plays pranks on Yuichi. She has an affinity towards the spring and once wished that it would stay spring forever.9 




Shiori is a first-year student who has suffered from an illness since birth. Her affliction has caused her to become very physically weak, and she is almost always absent from school because of it. Shiori stands outside, on the school grounds, nearly every day because she wants to meet someone dear to her. Voiced by: Hiroko Konishi (Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 games), Akemi Sat&lt;U+014D&gt; (anime/PSP game)




Mai is a third-year student of the same high school that Yuichi attends. She takes it upon herself to fight and defeat demons at night while the school is deserted.10 Due to this, she is constantly blamed for accidents because she never denies them, being too sincere to say anything and knowing that no one will believe that there are demons in the school. 


Secondary characters


Akiko is the easy-going mother of Nayuki and thus is Yuichi's aunt. She works at an unspecified job and takes care of the house, cooking various types of food, most of which is delicious except for her infamous &quot;special&quot; homemade jam, which she alone enjoys the taste of. 




Sayuri is Mai's only friend before she meets Yuichi, and thus her biggest part is during Mai's story. She is the daughter of a wealthy family, and always tries to smile and help others. She uses more formal Japanese honorifics for Yuichi when she addresses him, even when they become close friends. 




Kaori is mainly featured in Shiori's story, but is regularly seen due to her being Nayuki's best friend and Yuichi's and Nayuki's classmate; she is their class representative. She is smart and is knowledgeable about the schoolmates and townspeople, but is not aware of any of the supernatural things that occur. 




Mishio is a quiet girl, not unlike Mai, who is a key character towards the end of Makoto's story. She mysteriously warns Yuichi to stay away from Makoto when Makoto's health begins to fail. Mishio knows the mysterious and magical workings of the town, and she has experienced the loss that comes from asking for a miracle first hand. 




Jun is a friend of Yuichi's who sits behind him during school. Jun has a crush on Kaori and will often follow her around despite Kaori's dismissal of his romantic affections. His role is mainly for character development, as well as being one of the male characters who is explicitly referred to by name. 




Kuze is the student council president at Yuichi's school. He has a large ego and enjoys talking down to people, such as Mai, due to his standing in the school. He has a rather small role in the story, appearing during Mai's story in order to warn her not to do anything to wreck the dance party that she attended with Yuichi and Sayuri. 




Piro is a stray cat that Nayuki finds first and, despite her allergies, adores. Makoto loses the cat on purpose and then promptly searches until she finds it, having felt sorry for throwing it away. Makoto takes the cat home to the Minase house where it is loved by everyone.

The Kanon Standard Edition was released on November 26 2004 with added support for Windows 2000/XP as a DVD-ROM. Only this version and the original release contained pornographic scenes. Three months later on January 28 2005, the same game was released with the hentai content removed.

Yui Horie as Ayu Tsukimiya voiced the short introduction of the DVD, but was not featured in the contents of the DVD itself.
Reception and sales
&quot;Kanon was considered by many as the best PC bish&lt;U+014D&gt;jo game for 1999.&quot;14 The first PS2 release in 2002 was reviewed by the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu that is known for its tough criticism. The game had an overall score of 29/40 (out of the four individual review scores of 7, 8, 7, and 7).15 The Kanon Standard Edition was positively reviewed at visual-novels.net, commenting: &quot;From the amazingly beautiful opening of the game, through the long storyline for each character, to the wonderfully upbeat ending, this game is a marvel.&quot;16
According to a national ranking of how well bish&lt;U+014D&gt;jo games sold nationally in Japan, the Kanon Standard Edition premiered at number sixteen in the rankings.17 The Kanon Standard Edition remained on the top fifty list for the next two months, achieving the rankings of forty-seven and thirty-five.18 The all-ages version of the Kanon Standard Edition premiered at number forty-two on the national ranking, went up to thirty-five the next month, and did not appear on the rankings after that.19
The Dreamcast port sold 42,379 units in the first week and was the fourth top selling console game in Japan for that week.20 The Dreamcast version sold 49,047 units in total and is ranked the fifty-seventh highest selling Japanese Dreamcast game.21 Since its initial release, Kanon has sold over 300,000 units, not counting the PSP release.22
Characters from Kanon have appeared in several other d&lt;U+014D&gt;jin works not directly based on the Kanon series. Such as the Eternal Fighter Zero game by Twilight Frontier where most of the playable characters either came from Kanon or from an earlier Key game entitled One.23 The d&lt;U+014D&gt;jin game Glove on Fight featured at least two Kanon characters: Ayu Tsukimiya and Akiko Minase in a fighting style game along with various other characters taken from other media.24 The character Ayu Tsukimiya in particular is known to be extremely popular. In fact, Ayu &quot;has had more appearances outside of the original Kanon than any other anime or H-game character ever,&quot; states the Kanon information page on the website hentai.co.uk.25
Five days before the first PS2 release for Kanon, a PlayStation 2 printer called Tapis MPR-505 went on sale which enabled the user to print out game screens. Kanon was one of the three games supported at launch, the other two being America &lt;U+014C&gt;den Ultra Quiz from DigiCube and Marle de Jigsaw from Nippon Ichi Software.26
Adaptations

Makoto's novel, the fourth in the series.

Novels
There have been five novels written by Mariko Shimizu and published by Paradigm which were released in Japan between December 1999 and August 2000. The basis for each novel was one of each of the five heroines and had titles that were taken from the musical themes pertaining to each character in the original game. The first released was , in December 1999. Later that same month  was released becoming the second in the series. The third was  released in April 2000 and the fourth novel was entitled the fox and the grapes Makoto, released two months later. The final novel entitled  was released in August 2000.27 While the novels contained no illustrations within, the cover art was drawn by Itaru Hinoue, the artist who drew the artwork in the visual novel.
Drama CDs
There were drama CDs released based on Kanon. There are three complete sets of five CDs each, making the complete total fifteen, which were released over the course of three years between September 29 2000 and April 26 2003.28 The first two sets focused on each heroine separately per CD where the cover of the album would depict which of the girls was to be presented. The third set did not follow this format and Akiko Minase was depicted on the cover of the albums in this set.
Manga
 A Kanon manga was first serialized in the Japanese manga magazine Dengeki Daioh in December 2000, running until July 2002.29 The individual chapters were later collected into two separate volumes published by MediaWorks. The story was adapted from the visual novel version that preceded it, and was illustrated by Petit Morishima. There were six chapters in total, three in each volume. Aside from the prologue in volume one and the epilogue in volume two, the other four chapters concern four of the main heroines. From chapters one through four, the main heroines presented are: Shiori Misaka, Makoto Sawatari, Mai Kawasumi and Ayu Tsukimiya. To make up for Nayuki not getting a chapter of her own, the story is altered in that Nayuki is in most of the scenes Yuichi is in.3031
The manga is different than the visual novel in that Shiori's, Makoto's, and Mai's stories are not told in their entirety. Near the end of each of these girls' stories were originally intended to give the viewer the remaining answers, but the manga version ends these girls' stories prematurely.3233 This was due to the manga putting more focus on Ayu's story.
Anime
Kanon was first adapted into an anime in 2002, followed by a single OVA in 2003, and finally a separate adaptation created in 2006. With the conclusion of the second anime adaptation, there are thirty-eight episodes related to the Kanon anime. 
2002 original
The first Kanon anime was made by the Japanese animation studio Toei Animation and aired in Japan on January 30 2002, spanning a total of 13 episodes. Later, a single OVA was released on May 3 2003 called Kanon Kazahana. The original anime used the songs &quot;florescence&quot; and &quot;flower&quot; for the opening and ending themes respectively. While it did not appear as the ending theme in the first twelve episodes or in the OVA, the game's ending theme &quot;Kaze no Tadoritsuku Basho&quot; was used as the ending theme for the series in episode thirteen.34 Additionally, the game's opening theme &quot;Last regrets&quot; is played near the end of episode thirteen during the flashback scene.35
2006 remake
Kyoto Animation, the animators of another Key game-turned-anime, Air, decided to animate their version of Kanon. This 2006 version aired between October 5 2006 and March 15 2007 on the Japanese television broadcasting station BS-i.
In a magazine published interview, studio producers stated that the primary reason for considering a Kanon remake was largely in part due to Kyoto's Air anime being well-received by viewers. In the second episode of Air, in fact, the studio procured the rights and the original voice actors to give Ayu, Nayuki and Makoto a cameo as Kano Kirishima's school friends. Consequently, Kyoto Animation received numerous phone calls from viewers expressing their desire for the studio to animate Kanon.
The 2006 Kanon animation features the same voice acting cast as the original version released in 2002, with the exception of Yuichi and Kuze. This version is longer: twenty-four episodes instead of the previous thirteen. Unlike the original anime, the actual theme songs from the Kanon game are used for the anime remake's opening theme, ending theme and soundtrack. There is one song featured as an insert song in episode sixteen that did not come from the visual novel. It was entitled &quot;Last regrets -X'mas floor style-&quot; from I've Sound's first album Regret. Other songs are used from the arrange albums released over the years, such as Anemoscope, Recollections and Re-feel.
Music

Nine official albums and a single released related to the Kanon series were released. Of the nine albums, six were for the video game version, two were for the original anime adaptation and the last was for the anime remake. The first album entitled Anemoscope came with the limited edition box of the first Kanon release. Of the twelve songs on that CD, ten were arranged versions of songs from the game and the last two were the full-length opening and ending theme songs. From the nine albums for the video game, this only amounts to twenty-four separate songs which were either presented in their original versions or remixed in arranged, instrumental or in two albums, piano versions. One remix album entitled Orgel de Kiku TV Animation Han Kanon Sakuhin Sh&lt;U+016B&gt; presented fifteen songs from the original anime in music box versions.
