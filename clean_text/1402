The United States Marine Corps' Maritime Special Purpose Force, or MSPF, are a unique specialized sub-unit that are drawn from the Marine Expeditionary Units' major subordinate elements. They are special operations (capable) forces deployed to give the commanders low profile, two-platoon surgical emplacement in the accessible littoral regions. The MSPF provides the enhanced operational capability and precision skills to complement, enable, and execute in selected conventional, maritime special operations. Or even in other operations that are not resident in traditional amphibious raid companies.
The MSPF provides the MEUs in rapid direct action capabilities, to augmenting or replace the unavailable Force Reconnaissance, or Force Recon, platoons. It enables the Marine Corps's only deep recon unit, Force Recon, to continue providing FMF-level reconnaissance without delay.
Although, they cannot operate independently of its parent MEU as it relies fully on the it for logistics, intelligence, communications, transportation, and fire support. However, they are capable of conducting operations with, or in support of the operators of the United States Special Operations Forces. The MSPF's task organization are often conformed as an addition of the Amphibious Ready Group&lt;U+2019&gt;s Naval Special Warfare task unit detachment.
Organization

Usually a specially trained platoon from the MEU(SOC) boat company. Plus, an assault element, or AE that contains the deployed Force Recon The DAP are organized to conduct on-scene command, assault, security, and support functions. The R&amp;S element is organized to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance, sniper control and support, counter-intelligence, human and signal intelligence, and electronic warfare.1
