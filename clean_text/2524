Monfils was given a wildcard into the doubles event, but became more interested and inquired about getting a singles wildcard into the main draw.

Monfils is well known for his athleticism and his court coverage, regularly using slide to retrieve balls.38 His ability to go from defense to offense quickly can take his opponents by surprise. Monfils occasionally demonstrates that he is capable of generating significant pace on his groundstrokes. He has a reputation for showmanship and high-risk shotmaking.3940 During his own service games, he tends to go for an ace or a one-two combination to finish off the points early.He is also known for dancing to celebrate victories.He uses a semi-western grip forehand and a combination of continental/semi-western on his backhand. Monfils possesses a strong serve capable of reaching over 140 mph but his main focus is consistency and placement rather than power. Monfils was sponsored by Nike for clothes and shoes but changed to K-Swiss in 2010 and was sponsored by Head for racquets but changed to Prince in 2009. His current racquet of choice is the Prince EXO3 Rebel 95. His current string of choice is the Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power 16L String. 41 42
Personal life
Ga&lt;U+00EB&gt;l is nicknamed &quot;La Monf&quot;, or occasionally &quot;Sliderman&quot; due to his unusual sliding technique, especially on clay surfaces.43 He is of Caribbean heritage: his father, Rufin, a former football player employed as an agent for France Telecom, comes from the island of Guadeloupe. His mother, Sylvette, comes from the nearby island of Martinique and is a nurse. He has a younger brother, Daryl, who plays tennis. Gael and Daryl played doubles together in the 2012 Open Sud de France, losing in the first round.
Monfils considers Arthur Ashe to be his favorite player. He is fond of listening to music, particularly R&amp;B. If he did not play tennis, he would play basketball. He is a huge fan of the NBA's Denver Nuggets and his favorite basketball player is Carmelo Anthony.44 His best friends are countrymen and former juniors Josselin Ouanna and Paterne Mamata and fellow pros Richard Gasquet, Gilles Simon, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Monfils is also a fan of football and his two favorite football clubs are Arsenal F.C. and Paris-Saint Germain.45
He was coached by countryman and former ATP pro Thierry Champion (since September 2004) but they parted company in September 2006. Nevertheless, Monfils's fitness trainer is still R&lt;U+00E9&gt;mi Barbarin. Monfils announced a partnership with a new coach, Tarik Benhabiles, in May 2007. However, for the 2008 season, Monfils has hired Roger Rasheed as his coach. In 2011, Monfils parted ways with Rasheed and announced that his fitness coach, Patrick Chamagne would take the reins as his new fulltime coach.
Monfils appeared in the music video for &quot;Hello&quot; by Martin Solveig and Dragonette.46
Monfils was considered an athletics prodigy at school and won the French under-13 and under-14 100m championships. It was only his love for tennis that stopped him going on to compete at a higher level. His coach is on record as saying that Monfils could have made the Olympic 100m final such was his talent.
