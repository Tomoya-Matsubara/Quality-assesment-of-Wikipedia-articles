Manhattan is a borough of New York City, New York, USA, coterminous with New York County. Although its 2000 population of 1,537,195 is only third largest of the five boroughs, after Brooklyn (2000 population of 2,465,326) and Queens (2,229,379)2, it is the most densely populated county in the United States.3 If all five boroughs were independent cities, Manhattan would rank as the sixth most populous city in the United States, behind Los Angeles, Chicago, Brooklyn, Queens, and Houston. The Island of Manhattan is the largest section of the borough and county, which also includes numerous smaller islands and a small section of the mainland adjacent to the Bronx.
Manhattan is the borough most closely associated with New York City by tourists; even natives of New York City's outer boroughs will describe a trip to Manhattan as &quot;going to the city&quot;.4 A commercial, financial, and cultural center of the world, Manhattan has many famous landmarks, tourist attractions, museums and universities. It is also home to the headquarters of the United Nations and the seat of city government. Historically, its commercial streets have been characterized by thousands of unique and diverse shops, though a more recent influx of national chains has caused it to increasingly resemble other American cities and suburbs at a higher density. New York City is home to the most corporate headquarters of any city in the nation, the overwhelming majority based in Manhattan.5 Midtown Manhattan is the largest central business district in the United States.6 Lower Manhattan is home to both the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, and is the nation's third-largest central business district (after Chicago's Loop).7
History
 The name Manhattan derives from the word Manna-hata so written earliest in the 1609 logbook (Record of October 2) of Robert Juet, an officer of the Dutch East India Company yacht Halve Maen or Half Moon.8 The ship was captained by Henry Hudson, who, in the service of the Dutch Republic, was covertly commissioned to seek a Northwest Passage to China.9 The Half Moon first entered Upper New York Bay on September 11, 1609, and sailing up the lower Hudson River, anchored off the tip of northern Manhattan that night.10 As emissary of Holland&lt;U+2019&gt;s Lord-Lieutenant Maurits, he named the river he discovered after him; the Mauritius River.11 It was the explorer Adriaen Block who, in a text of 1613, referred to it as &quot;Hudson's river&quot;. During the Dutch period the river was mostly referred to as the North River which, until this very day, is the name used by people active in the maritime industry.
A manuscript map of 1610 depicts the name Manahata twice, on the west as well as the east side of the Mauritius River (later named Hudson River), referring to the tribes that lived at the mouth of the river as the Manahata Indians. Later historians supposed that these people would have been the Lenape and some have translated the manifold variations of the word as &quot;island of many hills&quot; from the Lenape language.12 In 1625, Johannes de Laet, Director of the Dutch West India Company wrote in his &lt;U+201C&gt;New World&lt;U+201D&gt;, &lt;U+201C&gt;The great North River of New-Netherland is called by some the Manhattas River from the people who dwell near its mouth; but by our countrymen it is generally called the Great River&lt;U+201D&gt;. In the 1630 edition, he continues to write of &lt;U+201C&gt;another fort of greater importance at the mouth of the same North River, upon an island which OUR people call Manhattas or Manhattans Island, because of this nation of Indians happened to possess the same, and by them it has been sold to the company&lt;U+201D&gt;. He thus confirmed that the island had been purchased in 1626 by Peter Minuit, the third director of New Netherland from the native Lenape Native Americans for 60 guilders worth of trade goods13 (traditionally converted to about $24) which according to the Oregon State University website's estimated conversion factors, is about the equivalent of 500&lt;U+2013&gt;700 USD today. However, if the money had been invested at anything above a 6.25% return (essentially a bond's current yield), it would be worth over $250 billion today, which exceeds Manhattan's estimated value of $200 billion.14
It is generally assumed that the Italian navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano explored New York Harbor in 152415 and that a few months later the Portuguese Esteban G&lt;U+00F3&gt;mez did the same.16 However, there is no evidence of any exploration, latitude calculations, surveying or mapping. There is only a vague textual description of having seen an estuary that may perhaps resemble Hudson&lt;U+2019&gt;s river. None of those navigators from other nations had penetrated well into the bay or explored the chief river substantiated with textual and visual evidence until the Dutch did so in 1609.
New Netherland was settled first in 1624 when thirty families disembarked from the ship New Netherland under the command of Cornelis Jacobsz May, New Netherland&lt;U+2019&gt;s first director, and settled on Governors Island. Peter Minuit was among them as volunteer. Their arrival transformed New Netherland into a province of the Dutch Republic from, previously, a territory for exploration and private trade since its discovery by the [Dutch] East India Company in 1609. Some of the settlers were spread around the territory in order to take physical and legal possession according to the Law of Nations. On this basis, the year 1624 has been recognized by the New York Legislature as the birth date of New York State.17
The States General (parliament) of the Dutch Republic had promised a trade monopoly for anyone who first would create and deliver a map based on private explorations and surveys for the territory situated between 40 and 45 degrees latitude. It was Adriaen Block and his partner Hendrick Christaensz who, based on four voyages, delivered a map in October 1614 to the States General on which they named the territory New Netherland. As a result, various trading companies amalgamated into the New Netherland Company in 1614, which was the recipient of a private trade monopoly with the natives.
In 1625, the second director of New Netherland, Willem Verhulst, together with his Council, selected Manhattan Island as the place for the construction of a Fort Amsterdam, a citadel for the protection of the new arrivals. Land surveyor and civil engineer Cryn Fredericxsz van Lobbrecht arrived in June 1625 to lay out Fort Amsterdam at Manhattan&lt;U+2019&gt;s tip. The citadel's original design called for it being open at the waterside on the west as per instructions of April 25, 1625, to civil engineer Cryn Fredericxsz, director Verhulst and his council. The year 1625 is therefore recognized as the birth date of New York City.18
In 1664, King Charles II had resolved to annex New Netherland and consolidate it with his North American possessions in order &lt;U+201C&gt;to install one form of government, both in church and state &lt;U+2026&gt; to install the Anglican government as in Old England&lt;U+201D&gt;. He sent an expeditionary force composed of New Englanders and &lt;U+201C&gt;reinforced by four royal ships crammed full with an extraordinary amount of men and warlike stores&lt;U+201D&gt; and demanded New Netherland&lt;U+2019&gt;s surrender. Director General Peter Stuyvesant and his council negotiated 24 articles of provisional transfer, which gave New Netherlanders liberties and freedoms unlike those available to New Englanders and Virginians.19 New York County was named in honor of the Royal Majesty of Great Britain, the Duke of York, later to become the Catholic James II of England, after whom the City and State of New York were also named.20
Consequently, the negotiations assured that the legal and political tradition of tolerance as the basis of cultural diversity and pluralism since 1624 was perpetuated by the Articles of Transfer under English authority. Thus safeguarded, the notion of tolerance endured after conclusive jurisdictional establishment of English dominion over New Netherland in 1674, and through the formation of the United States of America, when it was reintroduced as a constitutional right under the Bill of Rights in 1791. In 1691, however, the Catholic religion was outlawed in New York by an act of parliament. This ban technically remained in effect until the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783.
  From January 11, 1785 to Autumn 1788, New York City was the fifth of five capitals under the Articles of Confederation, with the Continental Congress residing at New York City Hall then at Fraunces Tavern. New York was the first capital of the country under the newly enacted Constitution of the United States from March 4, 1789 to August 12, 1790 at Federal Hall.21
New York City, surrounded by two brackish rivers, had a limited supply of fresh water available on the island, which dwindled as the city grew rapidly after the American Revolutionary War. To supply the needs of the growing population, the city acquired land in Westchester County and constructed the Croton Aqueduct system, which went into service in 1842. The system took water from a dam at the Croton River, and sent it down through the Bronx, over the Harlem River via the High Bridge, to storage reservoirs in Central Park and at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue, and through a network of cast iron pipes on to consumer's faucets. In the early twentieth century, the existing water supply system was supplemented with much larger reservoirs in the Catskill Mountains, connected to the city by a series of mammoth water tunnels.22
At the time of creation of New York County in 1683, its territory consisted of Manhattan Island, and occupied the same area that it occupies today. In 1874, the western portion of the present Bronx County was transferred to New York County, and in 1895 the remainder of the present Bronx County was transferred to New York County.23 In 1898, when the City of Greater New York was constituted as five boroughs, the separate boroughs of Manhattan and of the Bronx were formed, though both remained within the single County of New York. On January 1, 1914, legislation tool effect taking those parts of the then New York County which had been annexed from Westchester County as the new Bronx County, and New York County was reduced to its present boundaries.24
From the latter half of the 1960s through most of the 1970s, Manhattan suffered from urban flight as much of the middle-class fled to the suburbs due to an increase in crime. However, as with many other American cities, there was an increase in population growth in the latter part of the century due to a renewed interest in the urban lifestyle, a trend that began in the late 1980s and has continued to present day. It was thought that the September 11, 2001 attacks would initiate a new exodus from the City due to a fear of terrorism, but this has not occurred.

Geography

Central Park is visible in the center of this satellite image. Manhattan is bounded by the Hudson River to the west and East River to the east.

Manhattan Island is bound by the Hudson River to the west and the East River to the east. To the north, the Harlem River divides Manhattan from The Bronx and the mainland United States. The borough of Manhattan includes both Manhattan Island and several small islands, including Randall's Island, Ward's Island, and Roosevelt Island in the East River, and Governors Island and Liberty Island to the south in New York Harbor.25 Manhattan Island is 22.7 square miles (58.8 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;) in area, 13.4 miles (21.6 km) long and 2.3 miles (3.7 km) wide, at its widest (near 14th Street).26 New York County as a whole covers a total area of 33.77 square miles (87.46 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;), of which 22.96 square miles (59.47 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;) are land and 10.81 square miles (28.00 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;) are water.27
One Manhattan neighborhood is actually contiguous with The Bronx. Marble Hill at one time was part of Manhattan Island, but the Harlem River Ship Canal, dug in 1895 to improve navigation on the Harlem River, separated it from the remainder of Manhattan as an island between the Bronx and the remainder of Manhattan.28 Before World War I, the section of the original Harlem River channel separating Marble Hill from The Bronx was filled in, and Marble Hill became part of the mainland.29
Marble Hill is one example of how Manhattan's land has been considerably altered by human intervention. The borough has seen substantial land reclamation along its waterfronts since Dutch colonial times. Reclamation is most notable in Lower Manhattan with modern developments such as Battery Park City, created from land excavated during the construction of the World Trade Center. Much of the natural variations in topography have been evened out.
 Manhattan is loosely divided into downtown, midtown, and uptown regions, with Fifth Avenue demarcating Manhattan's east and west sides.
Manhattan is connected by a bridge and tunnels to New Jersey to the west, and to three New York City boroughs&lt;U+2014&gt;the Bronx to the northeast and Brooklyn and Queens on Long Island to the east and south. Its only direct connection with the fifth New York City borough is the Staten Island Ferry across New York Harbor, which is free of charge. The ferry terminal is located at Battery Park at its southern tip. It is possible to travel to Staten Island via Brooklyn, using one of Brooklyn's bridges, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.
The Commissioners' Plan of 1811, called for twelve numbered avenues running north and south roughly parallel to the shore of the Hudson River, each 100 feet wide (30 m), with First Avenue on the east side and Twelfth Avenue in the west. There are several intermittent avenues east of First Avenue, including four additional lettered avenues running from Avenue A eastward to Avenue D in an area now known as Alphabet City in Manhattan's East Village. The numbered streets in Manhattan run east-west, and are 60 feet wide, with about 200 feet between each pair of streets. With each combined street and block adding up to about 260 feet, there are almost exactly 20 blocks per mile. Fifteen crosstown streets were designated as 100 feet wide&lt;U+2014&gt;14th, 23rd, 34th, 42nd, 59th, 72nd, 86th, 96th, 106th, 116th, 125th, 135th, 145th and 155th Streets&lt;U+2014&gt;and almost all have become the borough's major crosstown transportation and shopping venues.30 Broadway is the most notable of many exceptions to the grid, starting at Bowling Green in Lower Manhattan and continuing north into the Bronx at Manhattan's northern tip. In much of Midtown Manhattan, Broadway runs at a diagonal to the grid, creating major named intersections at Herald Square (Sixth Avenue and 34th Street), Times Square (Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street) and Columbus Circle (Eighth Avenue/Central Park West and 59th Street)
A consequence of the strict grid plan of most of Manhattan, and the grid's skew of approximately 28.9 degrees, is a phenomenon sometimes referred to as Manhattanhenge (by analogy with Stonehenge).31 On separate occasions in late May and early July (for 2006 the exact dates are May 28 and July 12), the sunset is aligned with the street grid lines, with the result that the sun is visible at or near the western horizon from street level.3233 A similar phenomenon occurs with the sunrise in January and December (January 11 and December 2 in 2006).
The Wildlife Conservation Society, which operates the zoos and aquariums in the city, is currently undertaking The Manhattan Project, a computer simulation to visually reconstruct the ecology and geography of Manhattan when Henry Hudson first sailed by in 1609, and compare it to what we know of the island today.3435

Neighborhoods
 

Manhattan's many neighborhoods are not named according to any particular convention. Some are geographical (the Upper East Side), ethnically descriptive (Chinatown). Others are acronyms, such as TriBeCa (for &quot;TRIangle BElow CAnal Street&quot;) or SoHo (&quot;SOuth of HOuston&quot;), or the far more recent vintage NoLIta.3637 Harlem is a name from the Dutch colonial era after Haarlem, a city in the Netherlands.38
Some neighborhoods, like SoHo (South of Houston), are commercial in nature and known for upscale shopping. Others, like the Lower East Side and East Village, have been associated with the &quot;Bohemian&quot; subculture, though many artists have relocated to Brooklyn from these neighborhoods.39 Chelsea is a neighborhood with a large gay population, and also a center of New York's art industry and nightlife.40 Washington Heights is a vibrant neighborhood of immigrants from the Dominican Republic. Manhattan's Chinatown is the largest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere.41 The Upper West Side is often characterized as more intellectual and creative, in contrast to the old money and conservative values of the Upper East Side, one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the United States.424344
In Manhattan, uptown means north and downtown means south. Though avenues are often described as running north and south, and are often shown that way on city maps, the avenues more accurately run north-by-northeast.45 This usage differs from that of most American cities, where downtown refers to the central business district. Manhattan has two central business districts, the Financial District at the southern tip of the island, and the business district in Midtown Manhattan. The term uptown refers to the northern part of Manhattan (generally speaking, above 59th Street46) and downtown to the southern portion (typically below 14th Street47), with Midtown covering the area in between, though definitions can be rather fluid.
Fifth Avenue roughly bisects Manhattan Island and acts as the demarcation line for east/west designations (e.g., East 27th Street, West 42nd Street); street addresses start at Fifth Avenue and increase by about 100 per block heading away from Fifth Avenue.48. South of Waverly Place in Manhattan, Fifth Avenue terminates and Broadway becomes the east/west demarcation line. Though the grid does start with 1st Street, just north of Houston Street, the grid does not fully take hold until north of 14th Street, where nearly all east-west streets use numeric designations, which increase from south to north to 220th Street, the highest numbered street on the island.49

Government

 Since New York City's consolidation in 1898, Manhattan has been governed by the New York City Charter, which has provided for a &quot;strong&quot; mayor-council system since its revision in 1989.50 The centralized New York City government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services in Manhattan.
The office of Borough President was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority. Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the New York City Board of Estimate, which was responsible for creating and approving the city's budget and proposals for land use. In 1989 the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional on the grounds that Brooklyn, the most populous borough, had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island, the least populous borough, a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause pursuant to the high court's 1964 &quot;one man, one vote&quot; decision.51
Since 1990, the Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the City Council, the New York state government, and corporations. Manhattan's Borough President is Scott Stringer, elected as a Democrat in 2005.52
Each of the city's five counties (coterminous with each borough) has its own criminal court system and District Attorney, the chief public prosecutor who is directly elected by popular vote. Robert M. Morgenthau, a Democrat, has been the District Attorney of New York County since 1974.53 Manhattan has ten City Council members, the third largest contingent among the five boroughs. It also has 12 administrative districts, each served by a local Community Board. Community Boards are representative bodies that field complaints and serve as advocates for local residents. As the host of the United Nations, the borough is home to the world's largest international consular corps, comprising 105 consulates, consulates general and honorary consulates.54 It is also the home of New York City Hall, the seat of New York City government housing the Mayor of New York City and the New York City Council. The mayor's staff and thirteen municipal agencies are located in the nearby Manhattan Municipal Building, completed in 1916, one of the largest governmental buildings in the world.55

The Democratic Party holds the majority of public offices. Registered voters of the Republican Party are a small minority in the borough, with nearly 85% of those registered in a party registered as Democrats.57 Republicans constitute more than 20% of the electorate only on the Upper East Side and the Financial District. Local party platforms center on affordable housing, education and economic development. Controversial political issues in Manhattan include development, noise, and the cost of housing.
No Republican has won the presidential election in Manhattan since 1924, when Calvin Coolidge won a plurality of the New York County vote over Democrat John W. Davis, 41.20%&lt;U+2013&gt;39.55%. Warren G. Harding was the most recent Republican presidential candidate to win a majority of the Manhattan vote, with 59.22% of the 1920 vote.58 In the 2004 presidential election, Democrat John Kerry received 82.1% of the vote in Manhattan and Republican George W. Bush received 16.7%.59 The borough is the most important source of funding for presidential campaigns in the United States; it is home to four of the top five zip codes in the nation for political contributions. The top ZIP code, 10021, is on the Upper East Side and generated the most money for the United States presidential election for all presidential candidates, including both Kerry and Bush during the 2004 election.60

Crime

 Starting in the mid-19th Century, the United States became a magnet for immigrants seeking to escape poverty in their home countries. After arriving in New York, many new arrivals ended up living in squalor in the slums of the Five Points neighborhood, an area between Broadway and the Bowery, northeast of New York City Hall. By the 1820s, the area was home to many gambling dens and &quot;houses of ill repute&quot;, and was known as a dangerous place to go to. In 1842, Charles Dickens visited the area and was appalled at the horrendous living conditions he had seen.61. The area was so notorious at the time that it even caught the attention of Abraham Lincoln, who visited the area before his Cooper Union Address in 1860.62 The predominantly Irish Five Points Gang was one of the country's first major organized crime entities.
As Italian immigration grew in the early 1900s, many joined the Irish gangs. Al Capone got his start in crime with the Five Points Gang,63 as did Lucky Luciano.64 The Mafia (also known as Cosa Nostra) first developed in the mid-19th century in Sicily and spread to the East Coast of the United States during the late 19th century following waves of Sicilian and Southern Italian emigration. Lucky Luciano established La Cosa Nostra in Manhattan, forming alliances with other criminal enterprises, including the Jewish mob, led by Meyer Lansky, the leading Jewish gangster of that period.65 from 1920-1933, Prohibition helped create a thriving black market in liquor, that the Mafia was quick to capitalize on.66
New York City experienced a sharp increase in crime during the 1960s and 1970s, with a near fivefold jump in the violent crime rate, from 21.09 per thousand in 1960 to a peak of 102.66 in 1981. Homicides continued to increase in the city as a whole for another decade, with murders recorded by the NYPD jumping from 390 in 1960, to 1,117 in 1970, 1,812 in 1980 and reaching its peak of 2,262 in 1990. Starting circa 1990, New York City saw record declines in homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, violent crime, burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft and property crime, a trend that has continued to today.67
Based on 2005 data, New York City has the lowest crime rate among the ten largest cities in the United States.68 The city as a whole ranked fourth nationwide in the 13th annual Morgan Quitno survey of the 32 cities surveyed with a population above 500,000.69 The New York Police Department, with 36,400 officers, is larger than the next four largest U.S. departments combined. The NYPD's counter-terrorism division, with 1,000 officers assigned, is larger than the FBI's.70 The NYPD's CompStat sysytem of crime tracking, reporting and monitoring has been credited with a drop in crime in New York City that has far surpassed the drop elsewhere in the United States.71
Since 1990, crime in Manhattan has plummeted in all categories tracked by the CompStat profile. A borough that saw 503 murders in 1990 has seen a drop of nearly 78% to 111 in 2006. Robbery and burglary are down by more than 80% during the period, and auto theft has been reduced by more than 90%. Overall crime has declined by more than 75% since 1990 in the seven major crime categories tracked by the system, and year-to-date statistics through May 2007 show continuing declines.7273
Demographics


 According to 2005 U.S. Census Bureau estimates, there are 1,593,200 people (up from 1.4 million in 1990) 738,644 households, and 302,105 families residing in Manhattan. Counted on its own, Manhattan would be the fifth largest city in the United States, after the rest of New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston.
As of the 2000 Census, the population density of New York County was 66,940.1/mi&lt;U+00B2&gt; (25,849.9/km&lt;U+00B2&gt;), the highest population density of any county in the United States. In 1910, at the summit of European immigration to New York, Manhattan's population density reached a peak of 120,250.299/mi&lt;U+00B2&gt; (46,428.9/km&lt;U+00B2&gt;). There were 798,144 housing units in 2000 at an average density of 34,756.7/mi&lt;U+00B2&gt; (13,421.8/km&lt;U+00B2&gt;).74 Only 20.3% of Manhattan residents lived in owner-occupied housing, the second-lowest rate of all counties in the nation, behind The Bronx.75

The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 90.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.9 males.
Manhattan is one of the highest-income places in the United States with a population greater than 1 million. Based on IRS data for the 2004 tax year, New York County (Manhattan) had the highest average federal income tax liability per return in the country. Average tax liability was $25,875, representing 20.0% of Adjusted Gross Income.77
The Manhattan ZIP Code 10021, on the Upper East Side, is home to more than 100,000 people and has a per capita income of over $90,000.78 It is one of the largest concentrations of extreme wealth in the United States. Most Manhattan neighborhoods are not as wealthy. The median income for a household in the county was $47,030, and the median income for a family was $50,229. Males had a median income of $51,856 versus $45,712 for females. The per capita income for the county was $42,922. About 17.6% of families and 20% of the population were below the poverty line, including 31.8% of those under age 18 and 18.9% of those age 65 or over.79
Lower Manhattan (Manhattan south of Houston Street) has a sharply different population than the rest of the borough. According to the 2000 census, the neighborhood was 41% Asian, 32% non-Hispanic white, 19% Hispanic and 6% black. 43% of residents were immigrants. These figures are affected by the demographic weight of Chinatown, which accounts for 55% of the population of Lower Manhattan. While the Financial District had few non-commercial residents after the 1950s, the area has seen a significant surge in its residential population, with estimates showing over 30,000 residents living in the area as of 2005, a jump from the 15,000 to 20,000 before the September 11, 2001 attacks.80
Manhattan is a religiously diverse community. The largest religious affiliation is the Roman Catholic Church, whose adherents constitute 564,505 persons (more than 36% of the population) and maintain 110 congregations. Jews comprise the second largest religious group, with 314,500 persons (20.5%) and have 102 congregations. The next largest religious groups are Protestants, with 139,732 adherents (9.1%) and Muslims, with 37,078 (2.4%).81
The borough is also experiencing a baby boom that is unique among American cities; since 2000, the number of children under age 5 living in Manhattan grew by more than 32%. The growth is largely driven by the children of affluent white families. Manhattan&lt;U+2019&gt;s 35,000 or so white non-Hispanic toddlers are being raised by parents whose median income was $284,208 in 2005, which means they are growing up in wealthier households than similar youngsters in any other large county in the country. Among white families with toddlers, San Francisco ranked second, with a median income of $150,763, followed by Somerset, N.J. ($136,807); San Jose, Calif. ($134,668); Fairfield, Conn. ($132,427); and Westchester, N.Y. ($122,240).82

Economy
 Manhattan is the economic engine of New York City. Its most important economic sector is the finance industry. The 280,000 workers in the finance industry collect more than half of all the wages paid in Manhattan, although they hold fewer than one of every six jobs in the borough. The pay gap between them and the 1.5 million other workers in Manhattan continues to widen, causing some economists to worry about New York City's growing dependence on their extraordinary incomes. Those high salaries contribute to job growth, but most of this job growth occurs in lower-paying service jobs in restaurants, retail and home health care and not many jobs in highly paid areas.83
In 2006 the average weekly wage in Manhattan was $1,453, the highest among the 325 largest counties in the United States. The national average was $784.84 Wages in Manhattan were also the fastest growing among the nation's 10 largest counties.85
Culture
Manhattan has been the scene of many important American cultural movements. In 1912, about 20,000 workers, a quarter of them women, marched on Washington Square Park to commemorate the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, which killed 146 workers on March 25, 1911. Many of the women wore fitted tucked-front blouses like those manufactured by the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, a clothing style that became the working woman's uniform and a symbol of female independence, reflecting the alliance of labor and suffrage movements.86  The Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s established the African-American literary canon in the United States. Manhattan's vibrant visual art scene in the 1950s and 1960s was a center of the American pop art movement, which gave birth to such giants as Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein. Perhaps no other artist is as associated with the downtown pop art movement of the late 1970s as Andy Warhol, who socialized at clubs like Serendipity 3 and Studio 54 and was shot in the chest in 1968 by the radical feminist Valerie Solanas, founder of the group &quot;Society for Cutting Up Men&quot; (S.C.U.M.) and author of the SCUM Manifesto.
A popular haven for art, the downtown neighborhood of Chelsea is widely known for its galleries and cultural events.
Broadway theatre is often considered the highest professional form of theatre in the United States. Plays and musicals are staged in one of the thirty-nine larger professional theatres, all but one located in Midtown Manhattan in and around Times Square, with 500 seats or more, that appeal to the mass audience. Broadway theatres are usually run by a producing organization or another theatre group. A little more than a mile from Times Square is the Lincoln Center, home to one of the world's most prestigious opera houses, that of the Metropolitan Opera.
Manhattan is also home to some of the most extensive art collections, both contemporary and historical, in the world including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Guggenheim Museum.
The borough has a place in several American idioms. The phrase &quot;a New York minute&quot; is meant to convey a very short period of time, sometimes in hyperbolic form, as in &quot;perhaps faster than you would believe is possible&quot;. It refers to the rapid pace of life in Manhattan.87 The term &quot;melting pot&quot; was first popularly coined to describe the densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side in Israel Zangwill's play The Melting Pot, which was an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet set by Zangwill in New York City in 1908.88 The iconic Flatiron Building is said to have been the source of the phrase &quot;23 skidoo&quot; or scram, from what cops would shout at men who tried to get glimpses of women's dresses being blown up by the winds created by the triangular building.89 The &quot;Big Apple&quot; dates back to the 1920s, when a reporter heard the term used by New Orleans stablehands to refer to New York City's racetracks and named his racing column &quot;Around The Big Apple.&quot; Jazz musicians adopted the term to refer to the city as the world's jazz capital, and a 1970s ad campaign by the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau helped popularize the term.90

Sports
Today, Manhattan is home of the NBA's New York Knicks and NHL's New York Rangers, who play their home games at Madison Square Garden, the only major professional sports arena in the borough. The New York Jets proposed a West Side Stadium for their home field, but the proposal was eventually defeated in June 2005, leaving them at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
Today, Manhattan is the only borough in New York City that does not have a pro baseball franchise. The Bronx has the Yankees and Queens has the Mets of the Major League Baseball. The Minor League Baseball Brooklyn Cyclones play in Brooklyn, while the Staten Island Yankees play in Staten Island. Yet three of the four major league teams to play in New York City played in Manhattan. The New York Giants played in the various incarnations of the Polo Grounds at 155th Street and Eighth Avenue from their inception in 1883&lt;U+2014&gt;except for 1889, when they split their time between Jersey City and Staten Island, and when they played in Hilltop Park in 1911&lt;U+2014&gt;until they headed west with the Brooklyn Dodgers after the 1957 season.91 The New York Yankees began their franchise as the Hilltoppers, named for Hilltop Park, where they played from their creation in 1903 until 1912. The team moved to the Polo Grounds with the 1913 season, where they were officially christened the New York Yankees, remaining there until they moved across the Harlem River in 1923 to Yankee Stadium.92 The New York Mets played in the Polo Grounds in 1962 and 1963, their first two seasons, before Shea Stadium was completed in 1964.93 After the Mets departed, the Polo Grounds was demolished in April 1964, replaced by public housing.9495
The first national college-level basketball championship, the National Invitation Tournament, was held in New York in 1938 and remains in the city.96 The New York Knicks started play in 1946 as one of the National Basketball Association's original teams, playing their first home games at the 69th Regiment Armory, before making Madison Square Garden their permanent home.97 The New York Liberty of the WNBA have shared the Garden with the Knicks since their creation in 1997 as one of the league's original eight teams.98. Rucker Park in Harlem is a playground court, famed for its street ball style of play, where many NBA athletes have played in the summer league.99
Though both of New York City's football teams play today across the Hudson River in Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, both teams started out playing in the Polo Grounds. The New York Giants played side-by-side with their baseball namesakes from the time they entered the National Football League in 1925, until crossing over to Yankee Stadium in 1956.100 The New York Jets, originally known as the Titans, started out in 1960 at the Polo Grounds, staying there for four seasons before joining the Mets in Queens in 1964.101
The New York Rangers of the National Hockey League have played in the various locations of Madison Square Garden since their founding in the 1926&lt;U+2013&gt;1927 season. The Rangers were predated by the New York Americans, who started play in the Garden the previous season, lasting until the team folded after the 1941&lt;U+2013&gt;1942 NHL season, a season in which it played in the Garden as the Brooklyn Americans.102
Media
Manhattan is served by the major New York City dailies, including The New York Times, New York Daily News, and New York Post, which are all headquartered in the borough. Other daily newspapers include AM New York, The Greenwich Village Gazette and The Villager. The New York Amsterdam News, based in Harlem, is one of the leading African American weekly newspapers in the United States. The Village Voice is a leading alternative weekly based in the borough.103
Manhattan is home to most of the major radio and television stations in New York City. In 1971, WLIB became New York's first black-owned radio station and the crown jewel of Inner City Broadcasting Corporation. A co-founder of Inner City was Percy Sutton, a former Manhattan borough president and long one of the city&lt;U+2019&gt;s most powerful black leaders.104 WLIB began broadcasts for the African-American community in 1949 and regularly interviewed civil rights leaders like Malcolm X and aired live broadcasts from conferences of the NAACP. Influential WQHT, also known as Hot 97, claims to be the premier hip-hop station in the United States. WNYC, comprising an AM and FM signal, has the largest public radio audience in the nation and is the most-listened to commercial or non-commercial radio station in Manhattan.105 WBAI, with news and information programming, is one of the few socialist radio stations operating in the United States.
The oldest public-access television channel in the United States is the Manhattan Neighborhood Network, founded in 1971, offers eclectic local programming that ranges from a jazz hour to discussion of labor issues to foreign language and religious programming.106 Another notable channel in the borough is NY1, Time Warner Cable's first local news channel, known for its beat coverage of City Hall and state politics that is closely watched by political insiders.
Landmarks
 The skyscraper, which has shaped Manhattan's distinctive skyline, has been closely associated with New York City's identity since the end of the 19th Century. From 1890 to 1973, the world's tallest building was in Manhattan, with nine different buildings holding the title.107 The New York World Building on Park Row, was the first to take the title, standing 309 feet (91 m) until 1955, when it was demolished to construct a new ramp to the Brooklyn Bridge.108 The nearby Park Row Building, with its 29 stories standing 391 feet high (119 m) took the title in 1899.109 The 41-story Singer Building, constructed in 1908 as the headquarters of the eponymous sewing machine manufacturer, stood 612 feet high (187 m) until 1967, when it became the tallest building ever demolished.110 The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, standing 700 feet (213 m) at the foot of Madison Avenue, wrested the title in 1909, with a tower reminiscent of St Mark's Campanile in Venice.111 The Woolworth Building, and its distinctive Gothic architecture, took the title in 1913, topping off at 792 feet (241 m).112
The Roaring Twenties saw a race to the sky, with three separate buildings pursuing the world's tallest title in the span of a year. As the stock market soared in the days before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, two developers publicly competed for the crown.113 At 927 feet (282 m), 40 Wall Street, completed in May 1930 in an astonishing 11 months as the headquarters of the Bank of Manhattan, seemed to have secured the title.114 At Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street, auto executive Walter Chrysler and his architect William Van Alen developed plans to build the structure's trademark 185-foot-high spire in secret, pushing the Chrysler Building to 1,046 feet and making it the tallest in the world when it was completed in 1929.115 Both buildings were soon surpassed, with the May 1931 completion of the 86-story Empire State Building and its Art Deco spire soaring 1,250 foot (381 m) in the air.116117
The former Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, once an iconic symbol of the City were located in Lower Manhattan. By the end of the 20th Century the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center where arguably one of the world's most famous and recognizable buildings until their untimely destruction in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
The theatre district around Broadway at Times Square, New York University, Columbia University, Flatiron Building, the Financial District around Wall Street, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Little Italy, Harlem, the American Museum of Natural History, Chinatown, and Central Park are all located on this densely populated island.
The city is a leader in energy-efficient &quot;green&quot; office buildings, such as Hearst Tower and the rebuilt 7 World Trade Center.118

Central Park is bordered on the north by West 110th Street, on the west by Eighth Avenue, on the south by West 59th Street, and on the east by Fifth Avenue. Along the park's borders, these streets are usually referred to as Central Park North, Central Park West, and Central Park South, respectively. (Fifth Avenue retains its name along the eastern border.) The park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. The park offers extensive walking tracks, two ice-skating rinks, a wildlife sanctuary, and grassy areas used for various sporting pursuits, as well as playgrounds for children. The park is a popular oasis for migrating birds, and thus is popular with bird watchers. The 6-mile (10 km) road circling the park is popular with joggers, bicyclists and inline skaters, especially on weekends and in the evenings after 7:00 p.m., when automobile traffic is banned.119
While much of the park looks natural, it is in fact almost entirely landscaped and contains several artificial lakes. The construction of Central Park in the 1850s was one of the era's most massive public works projects. Some 20,000 workers crafted the topography to create the English-style pastoral landscape Olmsted and Vaux sought to create. Workers moved nearly 3 million cubic yards of soil and planted more than 270,000 trees and shrubs.120

Housing
In the early days of Manhattan, wood construction and poor access to water supplies left the city vulnerable to fires. In 1776, shortly after the Continental Army evacuated Manhattan and left it to the British, a massive fire broke out destroying one-third of the city and some 500 houses.121
The rise of immigration near the turn of the century left major portions of Manhattan, especially the Lower East Side, densely packed with recent arrivals, crammed into unhealthy and unsanitary housing. Tenements were usually five-stories high, constructed on the then-typical 25x100 lots, with &quot;cockroach landlords&quot; exploiting the new immigrants.122123 By 1929, stricter fire codes and the increased use of elevators in residential buildings, were the impetus behind a new housing code that effectively ended the tenement as a form of new construction, though many tenement buildings survive today on the East Side of the borough.124
Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village are sprawling private residential development on the East Side of Manhattan. One of the most iconic and successful of postwar private housing communities, Stuyvesant Town was planned in 1943.125 Its first tenants, two World War II veterans and their families, moved into the first completed building on August 1, 1947.126 Stuyvesant Town is a collection of red brick apartment buildings with typical housing project-style architecture, stretching from First Avenue to Avenue C, between 14th and 20th Streets. It covers about 80 acres of land. Stuyvesant Town has 8,757 apartments and with its sister development Peter Cooper Village they have a combined 110 buildings, 11,250 apartments, and over 25,000 residents.
Today, Manhattan offers a wide array of public and private housing options. There were 798,144 housing units in Manhattan as of the 2000 Census, at an average density of 34,756.7/mi&lt;U+00B2&gt; (13,421.8/km&lt;U+00B2&gt;).127 Only 20.3% of Manhattan residents lived in owner-occupied housing, the second-lowest rate of all counties in the nation, behind The Bronx.128
Infrastructure
Transportation
 

Manhattan is unique in the United States for its intense use of public transportation and lack of private car ownership. While nearly 90% of Americans drive to their jobs, public transit is the overwhelmingly dominant form of travel for residents of Manhattan.129 According to the 2000 U.S. Census, more than 75% of Manhattan households do not own a car (car ownership is greater in the other boroughs, but New York City as a whole is the only locality in the United States where more than half of all households do not own a car).130
The New York City Subway, the largest subway system in the world by track mileage, is the primary means of travel in the city. It connects to every borough except Staten Island. A second subway, the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) system, connects Manhattan to northern New Jersey. Commuter rail services operating in Manhattan are the Long Island Rail Road, which connects Manhattan and other New York City boroughs to Long Island, the Metro North Rail Road which connects Manhattan to Westchester County and Southwestern Connecticut, and New Jersey Transit trains to various points in New Jersey. Transit passengers tender their fares with pay-per-ride MetroCards, which are valid on all city buses and subways, as well as on PATH trains. A one-way fare on the bus or subway is $2.00,131 and PATH costs $1.50.132 There are daily, 7-day, and 30-day MetroCards that allow unlimited trips on all subways (except PATH) and MTA bus routes (except for express buses).133 The PATH QuickCard is being phased out, and both PATH and the MTA are testing &quot;smart card&quot; payment systems to replace the MetroCard.134
The MTA New York City Bus offers a wide variety of local buses within Manhattan. An extensive network of express bus routes serves commuters and other travelers heading into Manhattan. The bus system served 740 million riders in 2004, ranking first in the nation, more than double the ridership in second-ranked Los Angeles.135
Manhattan's transportation system is dense and varied. New York's iconic yellow cabs, which number 13,087 city-wide and must have the requisite medallion authorizing the pick up of street hails, are ubiquitous in the borough.136 Manhattan also sees tens of thousands of bicycle commuters. The Roosevelt Island Tramway, the only commuter cable car in North America, whisks commuters between Roosevelt Island and Manhattan in less than five minutes, and has been servicing the island since 1978.137 The Staten Island Ferry, which runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, annually carries over 19 million passengers on the 5.2 mile (8.4 km) run between Manhattan and Staten Island. Each weekday five vessels are used to transport almost 65,000 passengers on 110 boat trips.138139 The fare has been free since 1997, when the then-50-cent fare was eliminated.140
The metro region's commuter rail lines converge at Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal, on the west and east sides of Midtown Manhattan, respectively. They are the two busiest rail stations in the United States. About one in every three users of mass transit in the country and two-thirds of the nation's rail riders live in New York and its suburbs.141 Amtrak provides inter-city passenger rail service from Penn Station to Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C.; Upstate New York, New England; cross-border service to Toronto and Montreal; and destinations in the South and Midwest.
The Lincoln Tunnel, which carries 120,000 vehicles per day under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Manhattan, is the world's busiest vehicular tunnel.142 It was built instead of a bridge to allow for the free passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sailed through New York Harbor and up the Hudson to Manhattan's piers. The Queens Midtown Tunnel, built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting Manhattan with Queens and Brooklyn, was the largest non-Federal project of its time when it was completed in 1940.143 President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first person to drive through it.144
The FDR Drive and Harlem River Drive are two limited-access routes that skirt the East Side of Manhattan along the East River, designed by controversial New York master planner Robert Moses.145
Manhattan has three public heliports. US Helicopter offers regularly scheduled helicopter service connecting the Downtown Manhattan Heliport with John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.146
New York has the largest clean-air diesel-hybrid and compressed natural gas bus fleet in the country, and some of the first hybrid taxis, most of which operate in Manhattan.147
Utilities
Gas and electric service is provided by Consolidated Edison to all of Manhattan. Con Edison's electric business traces its roots back to Thomas Edison's Edison Electric Illuminating Company, the first investor-owned electric utility, which started on September 4, 1882, using one generator to provide 110 volts direct current (DC) to 59 customers with 800 light bulbs, in a one-square-mile area of Lower Manhattan from his Pearl Street Station.148 Con Edison operates the world's largest district steam system, which consists of 105 miles of steam pipes, providing steam for heating, hot water, and air conditioning149 by some 1,800 Manhattan customers.150
The New York City Department of Environmental Protection provides water to residents fed by a 2,000 square mile watershed in the Catskill Mountains. Because the watershed is in one of the largest protected wilderness areas in the United States, the natural water filtration process remains intact. As a result, New York is one of only five major cities in the United States with drinking water pure enough to require only chlorination to ensure its purity at the tap under normal conditions.151152 Water comes to Manhattan through New York City Water Tunnel No. 1 and Tunnel No. 2, completed in 1917 and 1936, respectively. Construction started in 1970 continues on New York City Water Tunnel No. 3, which will double the systems exisiting 1.2 billion gallon-a-day capacity while and provide a much-needed backup to the two other tunnels.153
The New York City Department of Sanitation is responsible for garbage removal.154 Trash is disposed at dumps in New Jersey, since the 2001 closure of the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island.155
Education

Education in Manhattan is provided by a vast number of public and private institutions. Public schools in the borough are operated by the New York City Department of Education, the largest public school system in the United States,156 serving 1.1 million students.157
Some of the best-known New York City public high schools, such as Stuyvesant High School, Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School, High School of Fashion Industries, Murry Bergtraum High School, Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics and Hunter College High School, are located in Manhattan. It also hosts a new hybrid school, Bard High School Early College, which serves students from around the city.
As of 2003, 52.3% of Manhattan residents over age 25 have a bachelor's degree, the fifth highest of all counties in the country.158
Manhattan has various colleges and universities (see List of colleges and universities in New York City). The list includes Columbia University as well as New York University (NYU) and Fordham University. Other schools include New York Institute of Technology, Pace University, Cooper Union and The New School.
The City University of New York (CUNY) is the municipal college system of New York City. The City University is the largest urban university system in the United States, serving serves more than 226,000 degree students and about as many adult, continuing and professional education students.159 A third of college graduates in New York City graduate from CUNY, with the institution enrolling about half of all college students in New York City. CUNY senior colleges located in Manhattan include: Baruch College, City College of New York, Hunter College, John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and the CUNY Graduate Center (graduate studies and doctoral granting institution). The only CUNY community college located in Manhattan is the Borough of Manhattan Community College.
