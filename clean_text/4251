Keynsham () is a town and civil parish between Bristol and Bath in Somerset, south-west England. It has a population of 15,533.1 It was listed in the Domesday Book as Cainesham, which is believed to mean the home of Saint Keyne.
The site of the town has been occupied since prehistoric times and is scattered with Roman remains. It became a medieval market town, after Keynsham Abbey was founded around 1170. It is situated at the junction of confluence of the River Chew and River Avon and was subject to serious flooding before the creation of Chew Valley Lake and river level controls at Keynsham Lock. The Great Flood of 1968 inundated large parts of the town. It was home to the Cadbury's chocolate factory, Somerdale, which opened in 1935 as a major employer in the town.
It is home to Memorial Park, which is used for the annual town festival and several nature reserves. The town is served by Keynsham railway station on the London-Bristol and Bristol-Southampton trunk routes and is close to the A4 road which bypassed the town in the 1964. There are also a range of schools, religious sporting and cultural clubs and venues.
History
Evidence of occupation dates back to prehistoric times, and the town site is scattered with Roman remains, such as the Roman villas at Somerdale which were discovered during the construction of the factory in 1922, and included the discovery of two stone coffins, a villa with nine intact panels of mosaic flooring at Durley Hill and a burial site between Keynsham and Saltford.2
It was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Cainesham, meaning St Keyne's home. It is believed that Saint Keyne lived in the 5th century. Her father was named as Brychan.3 According to local legend, St Keyne was warned by the local King that the marshy area was swarming with snakes, which prevented habitation. St Keyne prayed to the heavens and turned the snakes to stone.4 The fossil ammonites found in the area were believed to be the result.5
The settlement developed into a medieval market town, its growth prompted by the foundation of the influential and prosperous Keynsham Abbey, which had been founded by the Victorine order of Augustinian monks around 1170. It survived until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539, and a house was subsequently built on the site. The remains have been designated as a Grade I listed building by English Heritage.6
Keynsham played a part in the Civil War as the Roundheads saved the town and also camped there for the night, using the pub now known as the Lock Keeper Inn as a guard post.7 During the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685 the town was the site of a battle between royalist forces and the rebel Duke of Monmouth.8
Before the creation of Chew Valley Lake and river level controls at Keynsham Lock and weir, Keynsham was prone to flooding. The Great Flood of 1968 inundated large parts of the town, destroying the town's bridges including the county bridge over the Avon which had stood since medieval times, and private premises on Dapps Hill; the devastation was viewed by the Duke of Edinburgh.9 After the flood the Memorial Park, which had been laid out after World War II was extended.10
Keynsham rose to fame in the mid-1960s after featuring in a long-running series of advertisements on Radio Luxembourg for Horace Batchelor's Infra-draw betting system.11 To obtain the system, listeners had to write to Batchelor's Keynsham post office box, and Keynsham was always painstakingly spelled out on-air, with Batchelor famously intoning &quot;Keynsham &lt;U+2013&gt; spelt K-E-Y-N-S-H-A-M &lt;U+2013&gt; Keynsham, Bristol&quot;. This was done because the proper pronunciation of Keynsham &lt;U+2013&gt; &quot;Cane-sham&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; does not make the spelling of Keynsham immediately obvious to the radio listener.12
Governance
 The town council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&lt;U+2019&gt;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The town council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Playing fields and playgrounds are provided in Memorial Park, Downfield, Kelston Road, Teviot Road, Holmoak Road and Manor Road with basketball facilities at Teviot Road &amp; Holmoak Road and a BMX track at Keynsham Road. The Keynsham town council is also responsible for the football pitches and pavilion at Manor Road and the floodlit Multi Sport Site in Memorial Park. They also provide support for community groups organising music and cultural events.13 Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The town council was formed in 1991 and consists of 15 members elected every four years.14 There are 6 Liberal Democrats, 3 Labour and 6 Conservative.15 Keynsham has one official twin town: Libourne in France.16
From 1974 until 1996, Keynsham was administered as part of the short-lived county of Avon; it has since formed part of the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset, in the ceremonial county of Somerset. Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, was established by the Local Government Act 1992. The town is divided into Keynhsam North, which has two Conservative councillors, and Keynsham South which is represented by one Conservative and one Labour councillor.17 Bath and North East Somerset provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. They are also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters are in Bath, but many departments are headquartered in Keynsham. Between April 1, 1974 and April 1, 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon.18 Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Keynsham Urban District.19
The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North East Somerset constituency, which is a county constituency created by the Boundary Commission for England as the successor seat to the Wansdyke Parliamentary Seat. It came into being at the 2010 general election, and is represented by the Conservative Jacob Rees-Mogg. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It is also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects six MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.
Geography
 Keynsham is located on the confluence where the River Chew meets the River Avon. Fishing rights for the Millground and Chewton sections of the Chew are owned by Keynsham Angling Club. The Mill Ground stretch of the River Chew consists of the six fields on the western bank from Chewton Place at Chewton Keynsham to the Albert Mill. The water is home to a good stock of sizeable Chub, Roach, European perch and Rudd, along with good numbers of Gudgeon, Dace and Trout.20 Keynsham Lock on the Avon opened in 1727.21 Just above the lock are some visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between the lock and the weir. The weir side of the island is also the mouth of the River Chew.
Memorial Park, the northern part of which has existed as parkland since the 19th century,22 as shown by the ordnance Survey maps of 1864 and 1867,23 was formally laid out after World War II was extended after the floods of 1968.24 It covers  of woodland and grass alongside the River Chew. It commemorates the war dead of Keynsham and includes facilities including two children's play areas, a skateboard park, multi-sport area, bowling green, public toilets, a bandstand and refreshment kiosk. The formal gardens within the park are adjacent to the River Chew with the Dapps Hill Woods at its western end.25 Part of the park is known locally as Chew Park because of its proximity to the River and another area, close to Keynsham Abbey as Abbey Park.26 The park received the Green Flag Award in 2008/09, and again for 2009/10.27
On the outskirts of Keynsham lies Keynsham Humpy Tumps, one of the most floristically rich acidic grassland sites within the Avon area. The site is on a south-facing slope running alongside the Bristol to Bath railway line. It consists of open patches of grassland and bare rock, interspersed with blocks of scrub. It is the only site in Avon at which Upright Chickweed Moenchia erecta, occurs. Other locally notable plant species found here include Annual Knawel Scleranthus annuus, Sand Spurrey Spergularia rubra, Subterranean Clover Trifolium subterraneus and Prickly Sedge Carex muricata ssp. lamprocarpa.28 The site does not have any statutory conservation status, and is not currently managed for its biodiversity interest. Current threats to its ecological value include the encroachment of scrub onto the grassland areas, and damage from motorcycle scrambling. Between Keynsham and Saltford, a  area of green belt has been planted, with over 19,000 trees,29 as the Manor Road Community Woodland, which has been designated as a Nature Reserve.30 Nearby is the Avon Valley Country Park tourist attraction.
Along with the rest of South West England, Keynsham has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (50 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (34 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F) and 2 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (36 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F). July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around 21 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (70 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.31
Cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800&lt;U+2013&gt;900 mm (31&lt;U+2013&gt;35 in). About 8&lt;U+2013&gt;15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest. The predominant wind direction is from the south west.32
Demography
In the 2001 census Keynsham had a population of 15,533,33 in 6,545 households, of which 6,480 described themselves as White.34 Keynsham East Ward had a population of 5,479,35 Keynsham North 5,03536 and Keynsham South 5,019.37 In each of the wards between 75 and 80% of the population described themselves as Christians, and around 15% said that they had no religion.
In 1881 the population of the civil parish was 2,482. This grew gradually until 1931 when there were 4,521, before there was a steeper rise to 1951 when there were 8,277. Over the next ten years this nearly doubled to 15,152 in 1961.38
Economy
 An important industry in the town was Cadbury's chocolate factory, the Somerdale Factory. The J. S. Fry &amp; Sons business merged with Cadbury in 1919, and moved their factory in the centre of Bristol to Keynsham in 1935.39 As Quakers, the factory was built in a  greenfield site with social facilities, including playing fields and recreational sports grounds. Called Somerdale after a national competition in 1923, Keynsham Cadbury is the home of Fry's Chocolate Cream, the Double Decker, Dairy Milk and Mini Eggs, Cadbury's Fudge, Chomp and Crunchie.40
On 3 October 2007, Cadbury announced plans to close the Somerdale plant by 2010 with the loss of some 500 jobs. In an effort to maintain competitiveness in a global marketplace, production will be moved to factories in Birmingham and Poland. In the longer term it is likely the greenfield site will be re-classified and provide Keynsham with additional housing. Labour MP for Wansdyke, Dan Norris, said &quot;news of the factory's closure is a hard and heavy blow, not just to the workforce, but to the Keynsham community as a whole&quot;.41 In late 2007 campaigns to save the Cadbury's factory in Somerdale were in full swing. One local resident started a campaign to urge English Heritage to protect the site, and preserve the history of the factory. The campaign did not succeed and as of February 2009 the site is still scheduled for closure, and likely demolition. Cadbury have suggested that the land be redeveloped as a mixture of housing and commercial interests, giving a figure of approximately 900 jobs being created as a result.42
Before their takeover of Cadbury in February 2010, Kraft Foods had pledged to keep the Cadbury factory at Somerdale open if they were successful in their bid for the company.43 However, within a week of completing their purchase of Cadbury, Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld released a statement announcing that Kraft were to close the factory by 2011, as originally planned by Cadbury. The stated reason for this was that it was only after the purchase had been made that Kraft realised how advanced Cadbury's plans were.44 Industry experts have however questioned this explanation, arguing that Kraft invested so much in researching their bid for Cadbury that they should have been aware of the extent to which plans had been advanced.45
Culture
In 1969 the town was featured as the title of the fourth album Keynsham by the Bonzo Dog Band. The title was chosen in honour of Horace Batchelor, who had been referenced in previous Bonzo Dog Band recordings.46
Keynsham Festival, which started in the late 1990s,47 takes place in the Memorial Park each July,48 and attracts around 16,000 people.49 There is also a Victorian evening held in the town each November.50 Keynsham and Saltford local history society was formed in 1965 and is concerned with researching and recording the history of the area.51
Transport
 The town is served by Keynsham railway station on the London-Bristol and Bristol-Southampton trunk routes. It opened in 1840 and was re-named Keynsham and Somerdale in 1925. The factory had its own rail system which was connected to the mainline. The connection to Fry's chocolate factory was taken out of use on the 26&lt;U+2013&gt;27 July 1980. The station's name reverted to Keynsham on the 6 May 1974. The station was rebuilt in 1985 as a joint project between British Rail and Avon County Council.52
The A4 road used to run through the town, however much of this traffic is now carried on the bypass, which was constructed in 1964.53 Keynsham is on the Monarch's Way long distance footpath which approximates the escape route taken by King Charles II in 1651 after being defeated in the Battle of Worcester.54
Education
State-funded schools are organised within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset. A review of Secondary Education in Bath was started in 2007, primarily to reduce surplus provision and reduce the number of single-sex secondary schools in Bath, and to access capital funds available through the government's Building Schools for the Future programme.55 There are several primary schools in Keynsham, including St Johns primary school, Castle Primary school, Chandag infants and junior school and new school St Keyna primary school (a merge of Keynsham primary school and 150 yr old Temple Primary school). There are also two secondary schools, Wellsway School and Broadlands School.
 Wellsway School is an 11&lt;U+2013&gt;18, mixed comprehensive school which was established in 1971, by amalgamating Keynsham Grammar School and Wellsway County Secondary School both of which opened on a shared site in the mid 1950s. Most students that attend the school live in Keynsham and Saltford or the nearby villages.56 As of 2007, approximately 1350 students attend the school, ranging in age of 11&lt;U+2013&gt;18, with 64% achieving 5 or more A-C grades at GCSE.57 Wellsway's bid for specialist school status was accepted in September 2007. Meaning that Wellsway School now specialises as a Sports and Science College. This means the School has joined the national network of specialist schools, resulting in every school in Bath and North East Somerset now having a specialism. A joint bid is unusual as there are only six schools in the country with a combined Sports and Science specialism.
Broadlands School, with has specialist Science College and Engineering College status, has 1058 students,58 between the ages of 11 and 16 years. The school opened in 1935.59
Nearby Bath has two universities. The University of Bath was established in 1966.60 It is known, academically, for the physical sciences, mathematics, architecture, management and technology.61 Bath Spa University was first granted degree-awarding powers in 1992 as a university college (Bath Spa University College), before being granted university status in August 2005.62 It has schools in Art and Design, Education, English and Creative Studies, Historical and Cultural Studies, Music and the Performing Arts, and Social Sciences.63 The city contains one further education college, City of Bath College, and several sixth forms as part of both state, private, and public schools. In England, on average in 2006, 45.8% of pupils gained 5 grades A-C including English and Maths; for Bath and North East Somerset pupils taking GCSE at 16 it is 52.0%.64 Special needs education is provided by Three Ways School.
Religious sites
 Begun in 1292, the Anglican parish church of St John the Baptist gradually evolved until taking its present general form during the reign of Charles II, after the tower collapsed into the building during a storm in 1632.65 The tower, built over the north-east corner of the nave, now rises in three stages over the Western entrance and is surmounted by a pierced parapet and short croketted pinnacles and is said to have been built from the ruins of the abbey church. The south aisle and south porch date from 1390. The chancel, then the responsibility of the abbey, was rebuilt in 1470 and further restoration was carried out in 1634&lt;U+2013&gt;1655, following the collapse of the tower. There is a pulpit dating from 1634 and is also a screen of the same age which shuts off the choir vestry. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building.66
A former organ is said to have stood in the church, but &quot;had tones so mellow&quot; that Handel bargained for it, offering a peal of bells in exchange.67 The offer was accepted. The musician went off with the organ and the bells were delivered. There are eight bells in total, some made by the Bilbie family of Chew Stoke,68 the smallest bears these lines:69

&quot;I value not who doth me see
For Thomas Bilbie casted me;
Althow my sound it is but small
I can be heard amongst you all.&quot;

There are also the Victoria and Queens Road Methodist churches.70
Sport
Keynsham rugby football club play at Crown Field.71 The club's most notable and tragic event occurred on 24 December 1992, when there was a fatal road accident outside the club's ground. A Ford Fiesta car ploughed into 11 people leaving the annual festive disco. One woman, 21-year-old Sarah Monnelle, died at the scene. A second person, 24-year-old rugby player Richard Barnett, died in hospital two days later from his injuries.
