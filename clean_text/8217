The February 2009 tornado outbreak was a tornado outbreak that primarily affected portions of the South Central United States on February 10, as well as eastern sections of the United States on February 11. During the two-day span, 15 tornadoes touched down in seven different states;Oklahoma was struck by six, the most of any state. The first day of the outbreak proved to be the most active regarding tornadoes, while the second brought mainly high wind damage.
The outbreak occurred after a storm system moved across the four corners region into the central and southern Great Plains during the afternoon of February 10. A moist low-level air mass moved to the north across Texas and Louisiana into eastern Oklahoma and the Ozarks. Daytime heating of the moistening boundary layer increased through the afternoon across Oklahoma and Texas and combined with cooling aloft in conjunction with the approaching storm system, the air mass began to destabilized, which resulted in conditions supportive of thunderstorm development. A strong wind field, increasing with height through the lower troposphere, resulted in favorable wind shear for rotation in the thunderstorms. The risk of tornadoes was down significantly for February 11, as stronger frontal forcing limited discrete supercell activity and lowered the instability in the air mass. However, a squall line developed during the day and produced four tornadoes.
The most devastating tornado of the outbreak was an EF4 tornado that traveled through four counties in Oklahoma during the evening hours of February 10. It killed eight people and injured 46 others, as well as destroy 114 residences in Lone Grove. The Lone Grove tornado is the deadliest to hit Oklahoma since May 3, 1999 and the strongest tornado during the month of February in Oklahoma since 1950.
Synopsis
 During the afternoon hours of February 10, A strong middle and upper storm system moved across the four corners region and emerged into the central and southern Great Plains. A moist low-level air mass streamed northward across Texas and Louisiana into eastern Oklahoma and the Ozarks ahead of the system. Daytime heating of the moistening boundary layer increased through the afternoon across Oklahoma and Texas as cloud cover shifted eastward. Along with cooling aloft in conjunction with the approaching storm system, the air mass began destabilizing, resulting in the development of thunderstorms. A very strong wind field that increased with height through the lower troposphere resulted in favorable wind shear for rotation in the thunderstorms.1
As a result, large hail, damaging winds along with the potential for strong tornadoes was expected as thunderstorms developed from central Oklahoma southward into north central Texas in the afternoon hours. During the night, a cold front moved eastward toward the Mississippi Valley and organized the thunderstorms into a squall line. Along with a continued threat for hail and tornadoes, the risk of damaging winds increased.2 As a result, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk for severe weather for portions of eastern Oklahoma, northeastern Texas, western Arkansas, and northwest Louisiana.3
 At around 1 pm CST (1900 UTC), Violent thunderstorms began developing near the Wichita Mountains in Comanche County. The supercell thunderstorm that would produce the first tornado of the outbreak moved northeast through Caddo and Grady counties over the next 30 to 45 minutes, before reaching southeastern Canadian County at around 2 pm CST (2000 UTC).4 By 2:14 pm CST (2014 UTC), it was beginning to develop a hook echo, and the hook echo was fully developed four minutes later. Wall clouds were then reported from the Yukon area into western portions of Oklahoma City during the next 10 to 15 minutes.5 At 2:37 pm CST (2037 UTC), the supercell produced a tornado northwest of Warr Acres, causing damage near the Northwest Expressway.6 It continued showing signs of rotation on Doppler weather radar as it moved northeast across Oklahoma County. At 2:52 pm CST (2052 UTC), the supercell produced its second tornado near Edmond and moved into neighborhoods and subdivisions on the northwestern side of Edmond, produced its most severe damage near the Oklahoma and Logan County line. The tornado dissipated north of the Logan County Line at 3:05 pm CST (2105 UTC).7
The supercell produced three other tornadoes as it continued to move northeast. The first tornado occurred northwest of Meridian in Logan County at 3:26 pm CST (2136 UTC). The fourth tornado produced by the supercell developed near Langston in Logan County and moved to about  southwest of Stillwater in Payne County. The fifth tornado produced by this supercell in Oklahoma occurred in Pawnee County.8 There were also three tornadoes that struck northern sections of Texas and one tornado that hit Springfield, Missouri.910
 The most significant tornado of the outbreak first touched down in southeast Jefferson County at about 6:50 pm CST (0050 UTC) near the Red River. The tornado crossed through rural areas as it moved to the northeast into Love County, before going into Carter County at 7:10 pm CST (0110 UTC). The tornado continued moving to the northeast for the next 15 minutes, before striking Lone Grove.11 It came close to hitting the Newport Mesonet station as it passed through Lone Grove, before crossing Interstate 35 just north of the Prairie Valley Road exit. The tornado tracked through rural areas of northeastern Carter County to the east of Springer, and eventually crossed into southern Murray County, ending southeast of Dougherty at 8:00 pm CST (0200 UTC).12
The Storm Prediction Center also issued a very large slight risk area for February 11 which encompassed parts of the Deep South, Ohio Valley, Midwest, and Appalachians. The risk for tornadoes was lower on February 11 due to stronger frontal forcing, which limited discrete supercell activity, and lower instability.13 The slight risk was later upgraded to a moderate risk as a powerful squall line developed.14
