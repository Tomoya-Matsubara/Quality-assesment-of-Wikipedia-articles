Few American football players have come out as gay. There had never been a publicly out gay player in the National Football League (NFL) or at the Division I level of college football. Only six former NFL players publicly come out, but only after they retired.1
Reception
The macho environment that exists in football along with the hypermasculinity promoted by sportscasters make it difficult for a player to come out.23 Gay slurs are sometimes used in the locker room. Former NFL player Mark Schlereth said the slurs were not necessarily gay bashing, believing they were &quot;more out of ignorance than anything else. It doesn't excuse it, it's just the way it is.&quot;4 Prior to Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, San Francisco 49ers player Chris Culliver told a radio program that &quot;No, we don't got no gay people on the team, they gotta get up out of here if they do.... Can't be with that sweet stuff. Nah&lt;U+2026&gt;can't be&lt;U+2026&gt;in the locker room man. Nah.&quot; He also opined that any gay players should wait 10 years after retiring before coming out.5 Culliver received backlash for his comments,6 and he later apologized for his &quot;ugly comments&quot; that were &quot;not what I feel in my heart&quot;.789 Baltimore Ravens player Brendon Ayanbadejo, an advocate for same-sex marriage, estimated that 50 percent of the league agreed with Culliver, 25 percent disagreed, and 25 percent were accepting of everyone even if they were not in complete support of issues such as gay marriage.1011
Players coming out
Division II college football player Brian Sims came out to his team in 2000 while playing for Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania,12 and publicly told his story in 2009.13 Alan Gendreau was open to his Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football team from 2008 through 2011, but they made no mention of it to the media.14 Otherwise, he could have been the first publicly out gay active player in Division I college football.15 Outsports, a Web site specializing in gays and sports, released his story about being a gay football player on April 23, 2013.1617
After he retired, NFL player David Kopay in 1975 was the first major professional team-sport athlete to come out.1819 Many experts believe that the first openly gay active NFL player will not be a current athlete who comes out, but instead an already out high school or college player who ends up in the NFL.2021 CBSSports.com reported in April 2013 that one NFL had a player that was not openly gay, but his teammates were aware of his sexual orientation and did not care.22 That same month, Ayanbadejo said there was up to four NFL players who were considering coming out on the same day with the hope that any backlash would be shared and the pressure on one person reduced.23 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell emphasized that sexual discrimination was unacceptable in the NFL. His statement came after players said they were asked during the NFL Scouting Combine if they liked girls.24
