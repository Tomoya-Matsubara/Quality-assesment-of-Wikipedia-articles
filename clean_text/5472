This article concerns the grammar of the Icelandic language. Icelandic is an inflected language with four cases: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive. Icelandic nouns can have one of three grammatical genders, masculine, feminine or neuter. Nouns, adjectives and pronouns are declined in the four cases, in two numbers, singular and plural.
Morphology
Many German speakers will find Icelandic morphology familiar. Almost every morphological category in one language is represented in the other. Nouns are declined for case, number and gender, adjectives for case, number, gender and comparison, and there are two declensions for adjectives, weak and strong. Icelandic possesses only the definite article, which can stand on its own, or be attached to its modified noun (as in other North Germanic languages). Verbs are conjugated for tense, mood, person, number and voice. There are three voices: active, passive and medial; but it may be debated whether the medial voice is a voice or simply an independent class of verbs of its own. There are only two simple tenses, past and present, but to make up for that there are a number of auxiliary constructions, some of which may be regarded as tenses, others as aspects to varying degrees.
Nouns
Icelandic nouns are much like Old Norse, both in form and inflection. They decline in four cases (nominative, accusative, dative and genitive) and vary in gender (masculine, feminine or neuter) and number (singular and plural). There are two main declension paradigms for each gender: strong and weak nouns, that are furthermore divided in smaller paradigms for declension, according to many criteria (sound-shifts, consonant clusters etc.)

The gender of a noun can often be surmised by looking at the ending of the word:

Masculine nouns&lt;U+2014&gt;often end in -ur, -i, -ll or -nn
Feminine nouns&lt;U+2014&gt;often end in -a, -ing or -un
Neuter nouns&lt;U+2014&gt;if the last letter of the word has an acute accent (&lt;U+00B4&gt;), then the word is usually neuter

Whilst rare, some nouns, such as leikfimi (gymnastics) are not declined at all.
Articles
Icelandic does not have an indefinite article (a/an in English), and the definite article (the) is joined onto the end of word in question. The table below shows the different suffix forms for the three genders:



No article
Definite article




masculine
feminine


sing.

-ur
-ar


-i
-inn


-ll
-a


-nn
-nninn



The example below shows three nouns, one for each respective gender, declined in the accusative:

masculine: hvallur&lt;U+2014&gt;&lt;U+201C&gt;(a) whale&lt;U+201D&gt; becomes hvallurinn&lt;U+2014&gt;&lt;U+201C&gt;the whale&lt;U+201D&gt;
feminine: klukka&lt;U+2014&gt;&lt;U+201C&gt;(a) clock&lt;U+201D&gt; becomes klukkan&lt;U+2014&gt;&lt;U+201C&gt;the clock&lt;U+201D&gt;
neuter: heimilisfang&lt;U+2014&gt;&lt;U+201C&gt;(an) address&lt;U+201D&gt; becomes heimilisfangi&lt;U+00F0&gt;&lt;U+2014&gt;&lt;U+201C&gt;the address&lt;U+201D&gt;

Pronouns
Personal
The personal pronouns in Icelandic are as follows:




case
1st person
2nd person
3rd person




singular
nom.
&lt;U+00E9&gt;g
&lt;U+00FE&gt;&lt;U+00FA&gt;

acc.
mig
&lt;U+00FE&gt;ig
hann

&lt;U+00FE&gt;&lt;U+00E9&gt;r
honum
henni


gen.
m&lt;U+00ED&gt;n
&lt;U+00FE&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt;n

hennar


plural
nom.
vi&lt;U+00F0&gt;
&lt;U+00FE&gt;i&lt;U+00F0&gt;
&lt;U+00FE&gt;eir


acc.
okkur
ykkur
&lt;U+00FE&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;
&lt;U+00FE&gt;&lt;U+00E6&gt;r


dat.
okkur
ykkur
&lt;U+00FE&gt;eim



gen.
okkar
ykkar
&lt;U+00FE&gt;eirra




Icelandic has separate masculine, feminine and neuter words for they, when talking about a group of mixed gender people or items, the neuter form is used. Like English, the pronoun usually comes before the verb, as in the example below:


&lt;U+00E9&gt;g heiti Magn&lt;U+00FA&gt;s&lt;U+2014&gt;I am called Magn&lt;U+00FA&gt;s


But, just as easily, the order of the sentence may be inverted. In this case, the pronoun moves to the end of the sentence:


Magn&lt;U+00FA&gt;s heiti &lt;U+00E9&gt;g&lt;U+2014&gt;Magn&lt;U+00FA&gt;s I am called (or, literally Magn&lt;U+00FA&gt;s called I am)


In English, changing of the word order like this would render a phrase nonsensical. This is mainly due to the fact that whilst being a Germanic language, English has lost most of its noun declension. See syntax for more information.

Adjectives
Adjectives themselves must agree with the gender of the nouns that they describe. For example, the word for &lt;U+2018&gt;Icelandic&lt;U+2019&gt; would agree as follows:



masculine
feminine
neuter




&lt;U+00ED&gt;slenskur
&lt;U+00ED&gt;slensk
&lt;U+00ED&gt;slenskt


Icelandic





In addition, they must agree with the number (i.e. singular/plural) of the noun being described:



masculine
feminine
neuter




&lt;U+00ED&gt;slenskir
&lt;U+00ED&gt;slenskar
&lt;U+00ED&gt;slenskt


lit. Icelandics





Verbs
As with most declined languages, the verbs in Icelandic determine the case of the subsequent nouns, pronouns and adjectives of a sentence. In the infinitive, most Icelandic verbs end in -a. There are three main groups of verbs in Icelandic: -a, -i, and -ur, referring to the endings that these verbs take when conjugated in the first person singular present. Take the infinitive tala (&lt;U+2018&gt;to talk&lt;U+2019&gt;), for example:



Number
Singular
Plural




Person
&lt;U+00E9&gt;g
I
&lt;U+00FE&gt;&lt;U+00FA&gt;
you (compare archaic thou)


tala
to talk
tala
talk
talar
talk



And compare with the verb vera (&lt;U+2018&gt;to be&lt;U+2019&gt;):



vera
to be
er
am
ert
are
er
is
erum
are
eru&lt;U+00F0&gt;
are
eru
are





L&lt;U+00E6&gt;ra (&lt;U+2018&gt;to learn&lt;U+2019&gt;) is an -i verb:



l&lt;U+00E6&gt;ra
to learn
l&lt;U+00E6&gt;ri
learn
l&lt;U+00E6&gt;rir
learn
l&lt;U+00E6&gt;rir
learns
l&lt;U+00E6&gt;rum
learn
l&lt;U+00E6&gt;ri&lt;U+00F0&gt;
learn
l&lt;U+00E6&gt;ra
learn





And finally ver&lt;U+00F0&gt;a (&lt;U+2018&gt;to become&lt;U+2019&gt;), which is an -ur verb:



ver&lt;U+00F0&gt;a
to become
ver&lt;U+00F0&gt;
become
ver&lt;U+00F0&gt;ur
become
ver&lt;U+00F0&gt;ur
becomes
ver&lt;U+00F0&gt;um
become
ver&lt;U+00F0&gt;i&lt;U+00F0&gt;
become
ver&lt;U+00F0&gt;a
become





Note how for each of the verb groups, the conjugations in the singular change, but in the plural, the endings are nearly always predictable (-um, -i&lt;U+00F0&gt; and -a, respectively). As English learners of many foreign languages find, conjugation can be difficult to understand because the majority of English verbs are regular and have only one change in ending (-s for third person singular). However, in the majority of cases in Icelandic, the conjugation patterns can be easily picked up and remain regular across most verbs. However, it should be noted that one can not determine how to conjugate a verb merely from seeing its infinitive, so it is a matter of learning which group each verb belongs to.
Some Icelandic infinitives end with the -ja suffix. These verbs can be conjugated like -ur verbs, that is to say that the suffix is lost in the first person singular. When conjugating -ja verbs, the single &lt;U+2018&gt;j&lt;U+2019&gt; must also be removed, so syngja (&lt;U+2018&gt;to sing&lt;U+2019&gt;) would become &lt;U+00E9&gt;g syng (&lt;U+2018&gt;I sing&lt;U+2019&gt;) in the first person singular and not &lt;U+00E9&gt;g syngj.
Tenses
Strictly speaking, there are only two simple tenses in Icelandic, simple present and simple past. All other tenses are formed using auxiliary constructions (some of these are regarded as tenses, others as aspects). For example, the present continuous is formed thus:


personal pronoun + vera + a&lt;U+00F0&gt; + infinitive verb

&lt;U+00E9&gt;g er a&lt;U+00F0&gt; l&lt;U+00E6&gt;ra

I am learning


However, it should be noted that this construction only usually applies to abstract concepts, and is not used for activities, e.g. to sit would not use this construction. Instead, the simple present should be used.
The collective tenses are:

conditional
future
past

continuous
perfect
subjunctive

present

continous
perfect
subjunctive


Reflexivity
For many verbs that require an object, a reflexive pronoun can be used instead. The case of the pronoun depends on the case that the verb governs:


'''subject + verb + object (reflexive pronoun)

&lt;U+00FE&gt;&lt;U+00FA&gt; skemmtir &lt;U+00FE&gt;&lt;U+00E9&gt;r

you enjoy yourself


Here, we can tell that skemmtir governs the dative (you are giving the enjoyment to yourself) because the reflexive pronoun &lt;U+00FE&gt;&lt;U+00E9&gt;r is used. See above for other personal pronouns.
Adverbs
Compared to other lexical categories, Icelandic adverbs are relatively simple, and are not declined and can be constructed easily from adjectives, nouns and verbs. These derived adverbs often end in -lega (approximately equivalent to the -ly suffix in English):


n&lt;U+00FD&gt;r&lt;U+2014&gt;new &lt;U+21D2&gt; n&lt;U+00FD&gt;lega&lt;U+2014&gt;lately


However, like English, some common adverbs do not stick to this pattern:


n&lt;U+00FA&gt;na&lt;U+2014&gt;now

br&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;um&lt;U+2014&gt;soon


Other word classes
Prepositions
In Icelandic, prepositions determine the case of the following noun. Some examples are given below:



accusative
dative
genitive




um - about
a&lt;U+00F0&gt; - towards
til - to


gegnum - through
fr&lt;U+00E1&gt; - from
&lt;U+00E1&gt;n - without


kringum - around
af - off
auk - ''in addition


vi&lt;U+00F0&gt; - against
hj&lt;U+00E1&gt; - beside
mill - between



Syntax
Icelandic word order is SVO (subject-verb-object), generally speaking, with the subject and verb inverted in questions and when a sentence begins with an adverb. However, the inflectional system allows for considerable freedom in word order.
Questions
In Icelandic, questions can be easily formed by rearranging the order of the sentence from subject-verb-object to verb-subject-object. For example:


&lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00FA&gt; talar &lt;U+00ED&gt;slensku.&lt;U+2014&gt;You speak Icelandic.


can be made into a question as follows:


Talar &lt;U+00FE&gt;&lt;U+00FA&gt; &lt;U+00ED&gt;slensku?&lt;U+2014&gt;Do you speak Icelandic? (literally. Speak you Icelandic?)


This simple rule still applies when interrogatives are involved, which are simply added to the front of the sentence. The interrogatives in Icelandic are:

hva&lt;U+00F0&gt;?&lt;U+2014&gt;what/how?
hva&lt;U+00F0&gt;a?&lt;U+2014&gt;what kind of?
hver?&lt;U+2014&gt;who?
hvar/hvert/hva&lt;U+00F0&gt;an?&lt;U+2014&gt;where?
hven&lt;U+00E6&gt;r?&lt;U+2014&gt;when?
hvers vegnu/af hverju?&lt;U+2014&gt;why?
hvort?&lt;U+2014&gt;whether/which?

However, interrogative pronouns (hva&lt;U+00F0&gt;/hver) must decline with the verb that they modify, so the case of the pronoun will change depending on the verb.
