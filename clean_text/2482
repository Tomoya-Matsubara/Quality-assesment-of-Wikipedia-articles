Scream in Blue (Live) is a live concert album by Midnight Oil that was released in 1992 under the Columbia Records label. It contains songs carefully culled from 5 live concerts recorded over a 9 year period.1 The audiences sound quite large, but also included is material from a 1990 protest concert held on the street in front of Exxon headquarters in New York City.2 The album is mixed so as to sound like one continuous concert.
The album starts with a scathing, nearly atonal electric guitar solo and never lets up (until the final, more subdued studio bonus track Burnie), careening through a hooky hard-rock minefield of clever, socially conscious lyrics sung with passion over a rip-roaring but very tight band.3 The tracks were evidently recorded through the sound systems of the various concerts, then mixed to a clear and well-balanced sound in the style of audio verit&lt;U+00E9&gt;. Also, at the end of Only the Strong, a short sound sample is inserted containing some chanting by unidentified American Indians4 which also sounds passionately rendered, although jarringly out of context.
Reception

Critical reception of Scream in Blue (Live) was mixed. For instance, Allmusic's review by Roch Parisien5 was entirely in praise of the album, saying that it perfectly captured the edge and power of Midnight Oil's live performances, which consistently outshined the popular studio versions of the same material.
