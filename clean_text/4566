Brief details
Cecil Pitt (lived c1812) was a Tyneside songwriter, who, according to the information given by John Bell in his  Rhymes of Northern Bards published in 1812, has the song &quot;The Newcastle Signs&quot; attributed to his name.
The song is not written in Geordie dialect but is definitely local to Newcastle. It was sung at Newcastle Theatre Royal by Mr Scrifen on 4 June 1806
The same song with the same comments appears on page 89 of &lt;U+201C&gt;The Tyne Songster&quot; published by W &amp; T Fordyce in 1840 and in &quot; Marshall's Collection of Songs&quot; published by John Marshall in 1827.
Nothing more appears to be known of this person, or their life
