Harvey The Wonder Hamster is a song by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic. It originally appeared on Yankovic's Al TV and Al Music specials on MTV and MuchMusic. It was released on the album Alapalooza in 1993.
Yankovic would introduce his pet hamster, Harvey, sing Harvey's theme song, and after the camera angle changed so a fake non-live hamster could be substitured, Yankovic would dispose of Harvey, often in a violent manner. Harvey continues to make appearances on Al TV and Al Music specials, and appeared on The Weird Al Show as Yankovic's best friend and stunt-performing hamster.
