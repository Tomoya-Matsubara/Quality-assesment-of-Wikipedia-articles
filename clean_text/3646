Award description
The 1940-1945 African War Medal was a 52mm high (including suspension) by 33mm wide rectangular medal struck from bronze with sloped upper shoulders and rounded lower corners. Its obverse bore the relief images of the left profiles of a native African soldier wearing a fez and of a helmeted Belgian soldier, both within a recessed central area.

Air force personnel who served in theatre whether on an operational combat or transport unit received the medal with a miniature set of bronze wings on the ribbon4.
The 1940-1945 African War Medal was suspended by a ring passing laterally though a suspension loop at the top of the medal, from a 37mm wide light blue silk moir&lt;U+00E9&gt; ribbon with a 5mm wide central yellow stripe and 3mm wide yellow stripes situated 5mm from the ribbon edges5.
