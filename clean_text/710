This is a comprehensive discography of Godsmack, a Salem, Massachusetts-based heavy metal/hard rock band. As of December 2007 the band has released four studio albums, one EP, one compilation, three video albums, and 17 singles. This list does not include material performed by members or former members of Godsmack that was recorded with Another Animal, Dropbox, Fuel, or Ugly Kid Joe.
Godsmack was formed in late 1995 in Lawrence, Massachusetts by singer Sully Erna and bassist Robbie Merrill. Erna and Merrill recruited local friend and guitarist Lee Richards and drummer Tommy Stewart to complete the band's lineup.1 In 1996, Tony Rombola replaced Richards, as the band's guitarist.2 In 1998, Godsmack released their self-titled debut album, a re-recording of the All Wound Up demo.3 The album was distributed by Universal/Republic Records and shipped five million copies in the United States. After two years of touring the band released Awake. Although the album was a commercial success, it failed to match the sales of Godsmack.45 In 2002, Stewart left the band due to personal differences, and was replaced by Shannon Larkin.6 The band's third album, Faceless (2003), debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200.7 In 2004, Godsmack released an acoustic-based EP titled The Other Side. The EP debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA.8 The band released its fourth studio album, IV, in 2006. IV was the band's second release to debut at number one, and has since been certified platinum.910 After touring in support of IV for over a year, Godsmack released a greatest hits album called Good Times, Bad Times... Ten Years of Godsmack. The album included every Godsmack single (with the exception of &quot;Bad Magick&quot;), a cover of the Led Zeppelin song &quot;Good Times Bad Times&quot; and a DVD of the band's acoustic performance in Las Vegas, Nevada. At the same time of the album's release, Godsmack stated that they were going on hiatus.11 To date the band has sold nearly 10 million albums in the U.S., with an additional two million worldwide.1213
