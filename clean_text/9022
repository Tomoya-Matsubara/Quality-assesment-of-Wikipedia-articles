&quot;Almost Over&quot; is a song preformed by Limp Bizkit and it's included on the band's fourth album Results May Vary.
This song, along with &quot;Build A Bridge&quot;, was meant to be Limp Bizkit's next single after their second single &quot;Behind Blue Eyes.&quot; The song was never released as a single after Mike Smith's departure from the band (thus there's no official music video for the song).
The song was written by Fred Durst. It explains Fred's life events growing up from a child to a adult. It also explains how Fred's life is &quot;one big dream&quot; and doesn't wish to be awake yet because it's &quot;almost over&quot;.
Trivia

The song was played live at the &quot;2004 Pepsi Smash&quot;.
