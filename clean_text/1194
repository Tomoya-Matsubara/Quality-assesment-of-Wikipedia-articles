Baghdad is a 7-inch1 EP released by American punk rock band The Offspring on May 15, 1991. It is currently out of print, but sold 3000 copies within one week of its release. Although Baghdad has never been reissued on CD in its entirety, one of the songs were later released on compilations: &quot;Baghdad&quot; was released on Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1 (Fat Wreck Chords, 2004).2 The band's official website does not list Baghdad in the otherwise comprehensive discography anymore (as of July 2013, the website lists only the studio albums and their Greatest Hits compilation album).3

Track Notes
The EP includes an early version of &quot;Get It Right&quot; of which a later version was released on their second studio album Ignition. The title track &quot;Baghdad&quot; was a re-recording of the song &quot;Tehran&quot; which appeared on the Offspring's debut self-titled album in 1989. It switches the words &quot;Tehran&quot; (the capital of Iran) for &quot;Baghdad&quot; (the capital of Iraq). The EP also includes a cover version of &quot;Hey Joe&quot; by Billy Roberts (a different version from what was later released on &quot;Gone Away&quot;) and a previous unreleased instrumental track &quot;The Blurb&quot;, which would not appear on any future recordings, but served as the basis for an early version of &quot;Genocide&quot;, as well as &quot;Change the World&quot;.
