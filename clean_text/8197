&quot;Slow Down Baby&quot; is a song by American recording artist Christina Aguilera from her fifth studio album, Back to Basics (2006). RCA Records released it as the album's fourth single on July 28, 2007. It was written by Aguilera, Mark Ronson, Kara DioGuardi and Raymond Angry, and produced by Ronson and co-produced by Aguilera. The song is built around samples of &quot;Window Raisin' Granny&quot; (1973) by American group Gladys Knight and the Pips and &quot;So Seductive&quot; (2005) by American rapper Tony Yayo. Due to the inclusion of the samples, the original songs' writers obtained writing credits.
Musically, &quot;Slow Down Baby&quot; is a pop and R&amp;B song that incorporates elements of funk, hip hop and soul. It features claviola, horn, organ and piano instrumentation. The song garnered positive reviews from music critics, many of whom cited it as a standout track on Back to Basics. Critics also praised its blend of old and modern R&amp;B influences, as well as Aguilera's vocal performance. The single was only released in Australia during the Oceanian leg of Aguilera's Back to Basics Tour (2007). &quot;Slow Down Baby&quot; peaked at number 21 on the Australian Singles Chart, although it did not receive any promotion in that country.
Background
Aguilera's fifth studio album, Back to Basics, is made up of two discs.1 Aguilera worked with &quot;more beat-driven&quot; producers on the first disc, such as DJ Premier and Mark Ronson, who included samples in the production.2 The second disc consists solely of collaborations with producer Linda Perry.34 Aguilera sent letters to different producers that she hoped could help her with the direction she was taking for the project, encouraging them to experiment, re-invent and create a modern soul feel.5 She described the first disc as &quot;kind of a throwback with elements of jazz, blues and soul music combined with a modern-day twist, like hard-hitting beats&quot;.6
Aguilera and Ronson wrote &quot;Slow Down Baby&quot; alongside Kara DioGuardi and Raymond Angry, and Ronson completed the production with assistance by Aguilera.7 In an interview for Herald Sun, Ronson elaborated on the collaboration: &quot;I heard [Aguilera] was looking for tracks. I was a bit narrow-minded, I assumed nothing I was doing would be something she'd be into. I sent around some hip hop tracks I had lying about and got a call four days later saying she liked them.&quot;8 He stated that he had initially imagined offering &quot;Slow Down Baby&quot; to someone like rap duo M.O.P.9 Ronson provided the beats and played the guitar and bass, while Angry played the claviola, organ and piano.10 Ronson recorded Aguilera's vocals at Allido Sound in New York City and additional recording was helmed by Oscar Ramirez at The Record Plant in Los Angeles, California.11 Dave &quot;Hard Drive&quot; Pensado later completed the mixing process at Larrabee North in North Hollywood.12
