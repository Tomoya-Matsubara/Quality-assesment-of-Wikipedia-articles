Real Oviedo, S.A.D. (Asturian: Real Uvi&lt;U+00E9&gt;u) is a historically-important Spanish football team from Oviedo which is currently playing in the Tercera Divisi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n - Group 2. Founded on March 26, 1926, they were the first team from Asturias ever to play in the Primera Divisi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, and have the second greatest number of appearances in the Primera Divisi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n of any Asturian team.
They play in blue shirts and white shorts in the Nuevo Carlos Tartiere stadium, which seats 30,500 spectators and is the largest ground in the Tercera Divisi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n. The club has about 10,500 ticket holders; the average attendance during the regular season reaches 6,000 supporters.
History
Though they originally played in the Primera Divisi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n shortly after its inception, the gap caused by the Civil War meant that the club could not push on from earlier successes. until the arrival of one of its greatest players, Trist&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Esperanza. When La Liga play resumed in 1939, Real Oviedo were relegated to the second division, as their pitch was deemed unplayable â€” Franco's troops had used the stadium as an ammunition dump. For many years afterwards, Oviedo bounced between the Primera (38 seasons) and Segunda (32 seasons); their high point was qualifying for the UEFA Cup, while their low point was relegation to the Segunda B in 1978 for a single season.
Promoted to the Primera Divisi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n in 1988, they remained there until the 2000&lt;U+2013&gt;01 season, at one point finishing as high as sixth (in 1990-91). After being relegated from the Primera in 2002-03, Real Oviedo suffered severe economic troubles, which, when coupled with a profound lack of institutional support from the city's government, resulted in the team's inability to pay its players. Oviedo were then forced to drop all the way into the Tercera Divisi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n the fourth division of the Spanish football league system, for the 2003-04 season. At this point the team nearly folded, but they recovered, regrouped, and were promoted to Segunda 'B' in 2004-05. However, they lasted only two seasons there and were again relegated to Tercera, where they currently play. The team's survival remains at risk due to its continuing financial difficulties.
In the all-time league table for the Spanish top division, Real Oviedo are in 16th place; their chief Asturian rivals, Sporting de Gij&lt;U+00F3&gt;n sit at 15th.
