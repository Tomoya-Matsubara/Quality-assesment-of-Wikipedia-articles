James O'Mara (6 August 1873 &lt;U+2013&gt; 21 November 1948) was an Irish businessman and politician who became a  nationalist leader and key member of the revolutionary First D&lt;U+00E1&gt;il.1 As an MP in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, he introduced the bill which made Saint Patrick's Day a national holiday in Ireland in 1903. He was one of the few politicians to have served both as member in the House of Commons and in D&lt;U+00E1&gt;il &lt;U+00C9&gt;ireann.
Early life
Born in Limerick, O'Mara was educated by the Christian Brothers in Limerick, and at Clongowes Wood College in Dublin. His studies at the Royal University of Ireland were postponed after the death of his Uncle Jim in 1893, when James was sent to London to take over his Uncle's business functions. After his marriage in 1895 to Agnes Cashel, he moved to Epsom in Surrey, and then to Sydenham in London. He finally got his B.A. degree from the Royal University in 1898.
Political career
In the 1900 general election, O'Mara was elected unopposed as Irish Parliamentary Party MP for South Kilkenny.
His career in Westminster is noted for his introduction of the Bill which became the Bank Holiday (Ireland) Act 1903, making Saint Patrick's Day a national holiday. O'Mara later introduced the law which required that pubs be closed on 17 March, a provision which was repealed only in the 1970s.
In 1907, O'Mara resigned from Parliament and from the Irish Parliamentary Party to join Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in, the first MP to do so. He returned to Dublin in 1914 to continue his work in the bacon business, and remained active in Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in.
D&lt;U+00E1&gt;il &lt;U+00C9&gt;ireann
At the 1918 general election, he was Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in's Director of Finance and the party's fourth Director of Elections (his three predecessors having been imprisoned). He was elected as a Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in MP for his old constituency of Kilkenny South, defeating the Irish Party's Matthew Keating by 8,685 votes to 1,855.2 South Kilkenny was one of 73 constituencies returning Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in MPs pledged not to take their seats at Westminster. In the First D&lt;U+00E1&gt;il &lt;U+00C9&gt;ireann he became Trustee of D&lt;U+00E1&gt;il &lt;U+00C9&gt;ireann funds, and travelled to the United States with &lt;U+00C9&gt;amon de Valera to pursue a fund-raising drive. He resigned his trusteeship and his D&lt;U+00E1&gt;il seat in 1921 after a disagreement with de Valera.
A supporter of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, he was appointed as the first Irish Ambassador to the United States, but served only briefly.
After the death in 1923 of Philip Cosgrave, the Cumann na nGaedheal TD for Dublin South and brother of W. T. Cosgrave, O'Mara stood as the Cumann na nGaedheal candidate in the resulting by-election. Polling took place on 12 March 19243, and O'Mara was returned to the 4th D&lt;U+00E1&gt;il, which sat until 1927. He did not contest the June 1927 general election, and retired from politics.
He died on 21 November 1948 and is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin. His wife Agnes died on 2 June 1958.
