History
The site of the building was originally that of the United States Assay Office, what was the last public gold refinery in the United States.6 The Assay Office also was responsible for incinerating damaged paper money and melting damaged coins. In 1983 the United States Mint put the  property up for auction. Beginning at $3 million, the winning bid was made by HRO International Ltd., a New York realty developer, at $27 million. The sale established it as the most valuable government estate sold at public auction.7 The Assay office building was subsequently demolished in 1986.8
In 1987, HRO built the 36-floor building that stands today, naming the 23-43 Old Slip property One Financial Square.910 The Paramount Group purchased the property for $135 million in 1995,11 then in August 2007 sold it to Beacon Capital Partners for $751 million,12 one of the largest sales on record of an office building in Lower Manhattan.13
Like many buildings in Lower Manhattan, 32 Old Slip was battered with storm waters during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In contrast to most in the region, the building was designed to resist a powerful earthquake, which in part made the structure less prone to flooding.14 Within a year, the building's market value fell 21.6% to a total $65.7 million.15 In 2013 a renovation effort began to add improved flood barriers, pumps and piping systems to better ward against future storms.16
Architecture
The building is considered to be of a postmodern architectural style. Four sides of granite and silver-tinted glass make up the base, which give way to stepped transitions, eventually folding to an octagonal, entirely glass curtain wall.17
The floor sizes range from 23,404 to 38,750 rentable square feet, totalling 1,161,435 rentable square feet overall.18 It consists of columnless interior and a  lobby.19 There are 26 elevators in service and a parking garage beneath the structure.20 The ground level side and rear of the building feature a privately owned arcade and urban plaza.21
