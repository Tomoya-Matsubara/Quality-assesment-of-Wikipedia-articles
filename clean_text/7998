College swimming career
Wayte accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where she swam for coach Randy Reese's Florida Gators swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition from 1983 to 1987.4 As a Gator swimmer, she won two individual NCAA national titles in the 100-yard freestyle and the 400-yard individual medley in 1985.56 And with Gator teammates Laureeen Welting, Kathy Treible, Tracy Caulkins, Dara Torres and Paige Zemina, she was a member of the Gators' NCAA championship relay teams in the 400-yard and 800-yard freestyle relays for three consecutive years (1984, 1985, 1986), anchoring five of the six relays.7 In total, she won eight NCAA championships in those three years.8 She also won eleven individual Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships and was a member of ten SEC championship relay teams.9 Wayte was the SEC Swimmer of the Year in 1985, and received a total of twenty-six All-American honors in her four years as a collegiate swimmer.10
Wayte graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor's degree in telecommunications in 1989.11
International swimming career
From 1981 to 1988, Wayte was a member of the U.S. national swim team in international competition, winning medals in Japan (1981, 1985), France (1982), the Netherlands (1982), Venezuela (1983), Monaco (1985), Spain (1986) and South Korea (1988).12 At the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela, she won a gold medal as a member of the winning U.S. 4x100-meter freestyle relay team, and the silver medal in the 200-meter freestyle event.13
At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, Wayte won her first Olympic gold medal in the women's 200-meter freestyle event by defeating future Hall of Fame swimmer Cynthia Woodhead.1415 Her winning 200-meter time of 1:59.23 was her career best to date, overcoming Woodhead's early lead in the final 50 meters.1617 She earned her second Olympic gold medal by swimming in the preliminary heat for the winning U.S. women's 4x100-meter freestyle relay team.18
Four years later, when Seoul, South Korea hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics, she swam the freestyle leg for the silver medal-winning U.S. team in the women's 4x100-meter medley relay with teammates Beth Barr (backstroke), Tracey McFarlane (breaststroke), and Janel Jorgensen (butterfly).19 The U.S. silver medal medley relay team was fraught with last-minute drama, as several previously selected swimmers were replaced only hours before the race.20 Wayte also captured a bronze medal with the third-place U.S. women's 4x100-meter freestyle relay team that included Mitzi Kremer, Dara Torres and Laura Walker.21 Individually, she finished fourth in the women's 200-meter freestyle; she was also a medal contender in the women's 200-meter individual medley, but was disqualified when the judges ruled she used an illegal butterfly kick on the breaststroke leg of the medley.2223
