Cosmo4 is a Swedish girl group consisting of four members: Yasmine, Ulrika, Jenny, and Rudina. The group has released two successful singles since 2006. Previously, Carin was a member of the group until late 2006, when Carin left to concentrate on her studies and Rudina replaced her. The girls hail from different parts of the world. Yasmine is from China, Jenny is from Kenya, Rudina is from Kosovo and Ulrika is from Sweden; all of the girls live in Sweden.
In 2007, the group participated in the Swedish Melodifestivalen second semifinal with the song &quot;What's Your Name&quot; to compete for the chance to represent Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest in Finland. On 10 February, Cosmo4 was in the top five of Melodifestivalen 2007; in the final round of voting, the group placed fifth and was voted off of the contest.
In 2007, Cosmo4 will release their first album with hits such as Peek-a-Boo, Adios Amigos, and their Melodifestivalen entry, What's Your Name.1
Their Melodifestivalen entry became a hit and is was played on Swedish commercial radio.
The girls said on a newspaper that the will try again for Melodifestivalen 2009.
Their debut album &quot;All Around The World&quot; has been recorded and will be released in Russia in late 2007.
