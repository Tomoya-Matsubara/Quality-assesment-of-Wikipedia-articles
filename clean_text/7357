Malatya (Hittite: Malidiya1 and possibly also Midduwa;2 Assyrian: Meliddu;3 Urartian: Melitea; ; , Malat'ya) is a city in middle eastern Turkey and the capital of its eponymous province.
Overview
The city site has been occupied for thousands of years. The Assyrians called the city Meliddu.4 Following Roman expansion into the east, the city was renamed in Latin as Melitene. The site of ancient Malatya lies a few kilometres from the modern city in what is now the village of Arslantepe and near the dependant district center of Battalgazi (Byzantine to Ottoman Empire). Present-day Battalgazi was the location of the city of Malatya until the 19th century, when a gradual move of the city to the present third location began. Battalgazi's official name was Eskimalatya (Old Malatya); until recently, it was a name used locally.
History
Aslantepe and Ancient Malatya

Arslantepe has been inhabited since the development of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent, nearly 6,000 years ago. From the Bronze Age, the site became an administrative center of a larger region in the kingdom of Isuwa. The city was heavily fortified, probably due to the Hittite menace from the west. The Hittites conquered the city in the fourteenth century B.C. In Hittite, melid or milit means &quot;honey,&quot; offering a possible etymology for the name. After the end of the Hittite empire, the city became the center of the Neo-Hittite state of Kammanu. The city continued old Hittite traditions and styles. Researchers have discovered a palace inside the city walls, which has statues and reliefs that are examples of the artistic works of that age. The people erected a palace, accompanied by monumental stone sculptures of lions and the ruler. Archeologists first began to excavate the site of Arslantepe in the 1930s, led by French archaeologist Louis Delaporte.
The Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser I (1115-1077 B.C.) forced the kingdom of Malatya to pay tribute to Assyria. Malatya continued to prosper until the Assyrian king Sargon II (722-705) sacked the city in 712 BC. At the same time, the Cimmerians and Scythians invaded Anatolia, and the city declined. Since 1961, an Italian team of archaeologists, today led by Marcella Frangipane, have been working at the site.
Under Roman rule, Melitene was the base camp of Legio XII Fulminata. It was a major center in Lesser Armenia (P'ok'r Hayk'), remaining so until the end of the fourth century A.D. Emperor Theodosius I divided the region into two provinces: First Armenia (Hayk'), with its capital at Sivas; and Second Armenia, with its capital at Melitene.5
Middle Ages
During the reign of the Emperor Justinian I (527-565), new administrative reforms were carried out in this region, and Melitene became the capital of the province of Third Armenia.6 The city was captured by the Rashidun Caliphate in 638 became a base for their raids further into Anatolia, which was pursued also by the Abbasids. In the 9th century, under its semi-independent emir Umar al-Aqta, Malatya rose to become a major opponent of the Byzantine Empire, until Umar was defeated and killed at Lalakaon in 863. The Byzantines attacked the city many times, but did not finally take it until the campaigns of John Kourkouas in 927-934. After successively accepting and renouncing vassal status, the city was finally taken in May 934, its Muslim inhabitants driven out or forced to convert, and replaced by Greek and Armenian settlers.7
In the tenth century the Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas convinced the Jacobite Patriarch of Antioch to move many of his followers into the region of Melitene. These Syrians set up bishoprics in Melitene as well as in many surrounding cities.8 In the period that followed the Turkish advance into Anatolia after the Battle of Manzikert, Gabriel of Melitene, a Greek Orthodox Armenian (see Hayhurum) who had risen from the ranks of the Byzantine army, governed the city. From 1086 to 1100 he preserved his independence with the aid of the Beylik of the Danishmends and after 1100, he invested heavily on the commanders of the First Crusade, especially Bohemond I of Antioch and Baldwin of Boulogne.9
The Danishmends took over Malatya one years later in 1101 (see Battle of Melitene). With the Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate based in Konya taking over the Beylik of Danishmend in late 12th century, Malatya became part of their realm. It was part of Mamluks in end of 13th century. The city became Ottoman in 1515.
Modern
The current city of Malatya was founded in 1838, with the old site of Mitilene now designated as Old Malatya.10
Malatya was the scene of anti-Armenian violence during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. During the Hamidian Massacres of 1895-1896, the Armenians of Malatya unsuccessfully attempted to defend themselves against the persecutions of the Ottoman government. Over 7,500 of them were massacred, the great majority of them women, children and elderly.11 In the aftermath, a Red Cross team sent to Malatya and led by Julian B. Hubbell concluded that 1,500 Armenian houses had been pillaged and 375 burned to the ground.12
According to the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia, Malatya city was inhabited by 30,000 people at the time, with a clear Turkish majority, and an Armenian population of 3,000, of whom 800 were Catholics.13 A more recent source, however, states that Malatya's population hovered around 40,000, of which half (20,000) were Armenian.14 Of the five churches in the city, three belonged to the Armenians. They were chiefly involved in commerce, silkworm cultivation and agriculture. In the spring of 1915, the Armenians of the town were rounded up by Ottoman authorities and sent on death marches to the deserts of Syria. Those who survived the Armenian Genocide settled in a number of different countries.15
Cuisine
 Meatballs (k&lt;U+00F6&gt;fte) have a special place in the cuisine as do apricots, which are used in many meals from kebabs (meat broiled or roasted in small pieces) to desserts. There are over seventy kinds of k&lt;U+00F6&gt;fte (meatballs) usually made with wheat and other ingredients mixed in. &quot;Kagit Kebabi&quot; is one of the most important local specialities. &quot;Kagit Kebabi&quot; is a dish made of lamb and vegetables broiled in a wrapper, which is usually oily paper.
The Malatya region is best known for its apricot orchards. About 50% of the fresh apricot production and 95% of the dried apricot production in Turkey, the world's leading apricot producer, is provided by Malatya16 and the name of the fruit is synonymous with the city. After having been brought from its homeland in Eastern Armenia, it reached its most delicious and sophisticated form in the fertile soil of Malatya in Western Armenia, nourished from the alluvial soil of the Euphrates. Overall, about 10-15% of the worldwide crop of fresh apricots, and about 65-80% of the worldwide production of dried apricots comes out of Malatya. Malatya apricots are often sun-dried by family-run orchards using traditional methods, before they are collected and shipped throughout the world.
Festivals
Malatya Fair and Apricot Festivities has been held since 1978, every year in July, to promote Malatya and apricots and to convene the producers to meet one another. During the festivities, various sports activities, concerts and apricot contests are organized.
Near Apricot Festivities, there are also some other annual activities on summer. Cherry Festivities at Ye&lt;U+015F&gt;ilyurt District of Malatya and Grape Festivities at Arapgir District are organized annually.
Sports
Malatya's official team is Malatyaspor with colors red and yellow. Malatyaspor football team is currently competing in TFF Second League. Malatyaspor's stadium is Malatya &lt;U+0130&gt;n&lt;U+00F6&gt;n&lt;U+00FC&gt; Stadium located in the city's center. Malatya's other team is Malatya Belediyespor with colors green and orange. It is currently competing in TFF Third League.
Education
Inonu University, one of the largest universities in eastern region of Turkey, is located in Malatya. It was established in 1975 and has three institutions and nine faculties on its campus, with more than 2,500 faculty and 20,000 students. Its large campus is located in the southern part of Malatya. There are 162 High schools and some of the well-known, national high school entrance examination based high schools in Malatya are Malatya Science High School, Malatya Anatolian High School, Turgut &lt;U+00D6&gt;zal Anatolian High School, and Yaman Turk High School.
Transportation
By its relative advance in industrial growth, Malatya is also a pole of attraction for its surrounding regions, in commercial as well as inward immigration terms. The city is at a key junction in Turkey&lt;U+2019&gt;s road and rail network. By rail, it also serves as the junction for Aleppo through Syria-Samsun line. The bus terminal is located 5 kilometers west of the city center and there are regular intercity services to and from Ankara, Istanbul and Gaziantep. The railway station lies at a distance of 3 kilometers west of the city center and daily express trains run to Elaz&lt;U+0131&gt;&lt;U+011F&gt;, Diyarbak&lt;U+0131&gt;r, Istanbul and Ankara. Both these stations are easily reached by taxis and dolmu&lt;U+015F&gt; services.
Malatya's airport, Erha&lt;U+00E7&gt; Airport, is 26 kilometers west of the city center and there are daily domestic flights from Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. Since 2007 there have also been international flights during the summer months. These international flights are especially from German cities to Malatya, and most of the passengers are Turkish citizens who are now living and working in German.

Gabriel gave his daughter Morphia of Melitene in marriage to Baldwin along with a dowry of 50,000 gold bezants. He also helped pay the ransom for Bohemond when he was made captive by Danishmend Gazi. Even Baldwin's beard weighed heavily on Melitene. William of Tyre relates an anecdote in which Baldwin manipulates Gabriel's Oriental sensitivities, especially the reverence for the beard, and manages to extract 30,000 bezants from the ruler by duping him, through a scene arranged with his knights, into believing that he had put his beard in pledge for his soldiery's pay. Gabriel swiftly settled the account and Baldwin and his knights left rejoiced at the success of their stratagem, laughing heartily at the ridiculous veneration of the Orientals for the beard. There are no records of these Armenian assets thus siphoned having been later returned in one form or the other, either by Baldwin or relatives. In september 1101, the Danishmend Turks captured Malatya and in 1113, Baldwin forced Morphia to enter in a convent to marry another woman. (see limited preview) ↩
