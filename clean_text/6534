History and location
The restaurant is located in New York City's Central Park at Central Park West and West 67th Street on Manhattan's Upper West Side. It was originally the sheepfold that housed the sheep that grazed Sheep Meadow, built to a design by Calvert Vaux in 1870. It became a restaurant as part of a 1934 renovation of the park under Robert Moses, New York City's Commissioner of Parks.
Since 1934, the landmark Tavern on the Green restaurant in New York's Central Park has been managed by restaurateurs licensed by the City of New York's Park Department. In 1943 Arnold Schleifer and his nephews, Arthur Schleifer and Julius Berman won the contract to operate the restaurant. During their tenure, the dance floor was enlarged and nightly music was enjoyed. A large outdoor patio offered dining al fresco. Trees were first wrapped in the well-known twinkling lights around the property, and the Elm Tree Room was built to surround one of the city&lt;U+2019&gt;s classic elms. The menu was designed to be elegant but affordable for New Yorkers. Luncheon and dinner offerings changed regularly, and Mr. Berman would often add special desserts to celebrate family events, e.g., &quot;Parfait Ruth&quot; to honor the birth of his granddaughter.
The Berman-Schleifer Family ran numerous restaurants they owned and other New York City concessions. Among these were the food venues at Orchard Beach, the Claremont Inn (1934-1948) on West Side Drive, United Nations Caterers, Manny Wolfe&lt;U+2019&gt;s 49th Street Chop House on Third Avenue, and New York City's first air conditioned restaurant, Schleifer&lt;U+2019&gt;s Fashion Center on 7th Avenue.
In 1962 The Schleifer-Berman interest in the Tavern&lt;U+2019&gt;s operation was sold to Restaurant Associates. 5
In 1974, Warner LeRoy took over the restaurant's lease and reopened it in 1976 after $10 million in renovations. Since LeRoy's death in 2001, it has been managed by his daughter, Jennifer Oz LeRoy.6
Tavern on the Green was frequented by prominent actors, musicians, politicians, and writers. Regular patrons have included former New York City Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, actresses Grace Kelly and Fay Wray and many others.7 Tavern on the Green has hosted the wedding receptions of several prominent Americans, including Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Olen Butler8 and film director Walter Hill.9 John Lennon was a neighbor to Warner LeRoy and his son, Sean, was a playmate of Warner LeRoy's son, Max LeRoy. As a result, John and Sean celebrated numerous birthdays at Tavern on the Green during the late 1970s.10
In May 2008, the restaurant and the Westfield Group announced plans to open a second,  location in the Metreon mall in downtown San Francisco, California, in summer 2009.11121314 The plans had not materialized as of late 2009.15
In June, 2008, Tavern on the Green agreed to pay $2.2 million to settle a sexual and racial discrimination lawsuit over claims by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of &quot;pervasive harassment&quot; of women and minority employees.16
On August 28, 2009, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation announced that it had declined to renew the restaurant's license, granting it instead to Dean Poll, operator of the Central Park Boathouse. The LeRoy management was required to cease operations and remove all furnishings from the location before January 1, 2010.17
In September 2009, the restaurant filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, located in New York City, citing the 2009 national financial crisis and the August 28, 2009 loss of the restaurant's operating license.18 The rights to the name of the restaurant became an additional source of contention between the LeRoys and the city of New York during the bankruptcy court procedures in October 2009 after the LeRoys claimed the trademark was theirs while the city challenged them.19 At the time the trademark was appraised at $19 million.20 In November 2009, Poll registered a backup name with New York State: Tavern in the Park.21
