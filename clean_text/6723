Matt Cutts works for the quality group of Google, specializing in search engine optimization issues.1 He is well known in the SEO community for enforcing the Google Webmaster Guidelines and cracking down on link spam.2
Cutts started his career in search when working on his Ph.D at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His field of study was computer graphics and movement tracking, then moved into the field of information retrieval after taking outside classes from the university's Information and Library Science department. He did not complete the Ph.D before moving to Google, but acquired a M.S. degree.3
Cutts is one of the co-inventors listed upon one of the most well-known patent filings from Google 4, involving search engines and web spam, which was the first 5 to publicly propose using historical data to identify link spam.
In August 2006, Cutts admitted to using the identity GoogleGuy in posts to web related boards. 6
