Achentoul (Scottish Gaelic: Achadh an t-Sabhail; translation: &quot;field of the barn&quot;) is a village in the Kinbrace area of Sutherland, in the Scottish council area of Highland. Consisting of a few farmhouses and barns, Achentoul lies north of Kinbrace along A897 road and south of Loch An Ruathair.12 Although the Achentoul Forest is located in this area, the landscape is said to be dominated by Moist Atlantic heather moor.3 
Geography
The Achentoul Estate boasts several lochs and these include, Loch Ascaig, Loch Arachlinie, Loch Badanloch, Loch Ruthair, Loch Drum, Loch Lucy, Loch Cullidh, Loch Dubh, Loch Sletill, Loch Badanloch.4 Loch fishing is available on a number of the estate's lochs.
Flora and fauna
The rugged and remote Achentoul Forest lies to the north of Achentoul Lodge.5 A Deer forest, it has been a noted sporting estate for deer shooting for centuries.6 The area is frequented by deer year round, as well as Birds of prey.7
Culture
Achentoul Lodge was built c. 1900. It is situated southeast of Loch An Ruathair, overlooking the moorland to the north of Kinbrace.8
The lodge organizes Hind stalking and rabbit shooting on its farm during the winter months (October-February) to kill deer which are considered pests to the forest.9 It is considered a &quot;sport&quot; and the farm charges up to &lt;U+00A3&gt;130 for a session if the shooter hires a keeper, although a stalker is only permitted to kill two deer in a session.10 However, the farm claims that the hind stalking is for woodland conservation purposes primarily, given that the Achentoul estate by 1970 had dedicated 1000 acres for afforestation and sold 604 acres to the Forestry Commission.11
A notable family on the farm are the Nutting family who hired the late Donald Mackay to manage the farm in 1958. He worked in Achentoul for a long time with the Henderson brothers; he died in 2010, aged 76.12
The Ca na Catanach is a  Heritage Path, long-distance footpath, medieval road and drovers' road that starts at Dorrery Lodge and ends just north of Achentoul.13
Kinbrace Hill (also known as Kinbrace Farm or Achentoul Forest) is noted by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland for a long, chambered cairn.14
