Chicago Cubs
On December 7, 2005, the Marlins traded Pierre to the Chicago Cubs, receiving pitchers Sergio Mitre, Ricky Nolasco, and Renyel Pinto in exchange. The deal was motivated by the Marlins' need to cut payroll after finding itself unable to secure a new stadium deal in South Florida.

However, he also led the major leagues in outs made (532), the second-highest out total for a player since .
Los Angeles Dodgers
On November 22, 2006, Pierre signed a $44 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers8.
 In , Pierre led the majors in bunt hits (19).

He was 2nd in the NL in stolen bases (64), 3rd in at bats (668) and plate appearances (729), 4th in hits (196), and 9th in triples (8).
Going into , the Dodgers signed Andruw Jones to a two-year contract to play center field. Because of this, Pierre shifted to left field. After a trip to the DL in July, Pierre was moved into a platoon in center field with the struggling Jones. When the Dodgers traded for Manny Ramirez, Pierre moved to the bench and saw limited action, primarily as a pinch runner the rest of the season.
After nearly 2 years without hitting a home run, Pierre hit a ball into the right field seats at PNC Park in Pittsburgh on September 15, 2008. It was Pierre's first traditional fly ball home run since August 28, 2006, also in Pittsburgh.
Pierre became a fan favorite early in his career because of his speed, durability, and work ethic. He led the National League in stolen bases in  and , and stole at least 45 bases each year from 2001 to 2006; because of his great speed and ability for contact hitting, many believe he is one of the best leadoff hitters in baseball. Critics are quick to point out that, in contrast to a prototypical leadoff hitter, Pierre rarely walks and must hit for a high average to sustain a high on-base percentage, which Pierre has not accomplished since . His slugging percentage is also below average due to his inability to collect extra-base hits. His most glaring weakness is his lack of home runs, with only 12 for his entire career and with two different seasons of none whatsoever.
