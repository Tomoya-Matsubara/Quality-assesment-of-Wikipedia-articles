The Brazilian Top Team (BTT) is a mixed martial arts academy specializing in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and boxing. The academy was established in April 2000 by Murilo Bustamante, Ricardo Lib&lt;U+00F3&gt;rio, M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rio Sperry and Luis Roberto Duarte, former-members of the Carlson Gracie Academy, to develop and create new training techniques for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, submission wrestling and mixed martial arts.
In April 2002 BTT inaugurated a new center for training professional fighters in mixed martial arts. In the new center the athletes are able to count on professors of: muay thai, boxing, wrestling and the already recognized skills of its professors of mixed martial arts and jiu-jitsu.
BTT maintains an intense rivalry with Brazilian mixed martial arts stable Chute Boxe, which is descended from a Muay Thai lineage. BTT traces its lineage to the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu of Carlson Gracie.
