Greta Lovisa Gustafsson 18 September 1905  15 April 1990, better known as Greta Garbo, was a noted Swedish people Swedish actress and recluse. She was a major star in the United States during the silent film era and the Golden Age of Hollywood. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Garbo fifth on their list of AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars greatest female stars of all time, after Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Audrey Hepburn, and Ingrid Bergman.

Garbo launched her career with a major role in the Swedish film The Saga of Gosta Berling. Her performance caught the attention of Louis B. Mayer, who brought her to Hollywood in 1925 to work at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer MGM. She became a star of silent films.

Garbo was one of the few actresses to negotiate the transition to soundWhom? date=March 2011. Her first talking film was Anna Christie 1930 film Anna Christie 1930, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award. MGM marketers enticed the public with the catchphrase Garbo talks! In 1932, her popularity allowed her to dictate the terms of her contract, and she became increasingly choosy about her roles.

She received the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress for Anna Karenina 1935 film Anna Karenina 1935, but she considered her performance as the courtesan The Lady of the Camellias Marguerite Gautier in Camille 1936 film Camille 1936 her best performance; the role gained her a second Academy Award nomination. After working exclusively in dramatic films, Garbo turned to comedy with Ninotchka 1939 and Two-Faced Woman 1941. For Ninotchka, Garbo was again nominated for an Academy Award; Two-Faced Woman did well at the box office, but was a critical failure.

After 1941, she retired after appearing in 27 films, and became increasingly reclusive. She has been indelibly linked to one of her lines from the film Grand Hotel film Grand Hotel: I want to be alone. She later remarked, I never said, 'I want to be alone.' I only said, 'I want to be let alone.' There is all the difference. To the end of her life, Garbo-watching became a sport among the paparazzi and the media, but she remained elusive up until her death in 1990 at the age of 84.

Biography
Childhood and youth 19051920
Garbo was born in Stockholm, Sweden. She was the third and youngest child of Anna Lovisa ne Karlsson 18721944  a homemaker and later employee at a jam factory  and Karl Alfred Gustafsson 18711920, an unskilled worker. Her siblings were Sven Alfred 18981967 and Alva Maria 19031926.

Garbo's parents had met in Stockholm, where her father made occasional trips from his home in Frinnaryd. He moved to Stockholm to become independent. He eventually worked various odd jobs and married Garbo's mother, who had recently relocated from Hgsby.http://carina.stridlund.se/hellbomwebb/pcf361e2e.html Karl Alfred Gustafsson.

The family lived at Blekingegatan No. 32 in Sdermalm, a working-class district regarded as the city's slum, in a small, cold-water tenement apartment. She would later recall:

quote It was eternally gray&nbsp; those long winter's nights. My father would be sitting in a corner, scribbling figures on a newspaper. On the other side of the room my mother is repairing ragged old clothes, sighing. We children would be talking in very low voices, or just sitting silently. We are filled with anxiety, as if there is danger in the air. Such evenings are unforgettable for a sensitive girl. Where we lived, all the houses and apartments looked alike, their ugliness matched by everything surrounding us.

As a child, Garbo was a shy daydreamer.Cite book author= Liberty Library Corporation  title= Liberty  url= http://books.google.com/books?id=vQYAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA57  accessdate= 4 August 2010  year= 1974  publisher= Liberty Library Corporation  pages= 2731 & 5457  She hated schoolCite journal journal= Life Magazine  date= 8  year= 1937  month= November title= LIFE  volume= 3  issue= 19  pages= 81  url= http://books.google.com/books?id=kD8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA81  accessdate= 4 August 2010  publisher= Time Inc  issn= 0024-3019  and did not play much, but became interested in theater from an early age and dreamed about becoming an actress.

Early career 19201924
Her first job was as a soap-lather girl in a barbershop. One day a young man by the name of Kristian Bergstrm, son of the founder of the PUB Stockholm PUB department store, came in for a shave. He eventually offered her a job as a clerk at PUB. She accepted the offer and started working at PUB in July 1920, where she also model person modeled for newspaper advertisements. She appeared in two short film advertisements, the first for PUB. They were eventually seen by comedy director Erik Arthur Petschler. He gave her a part in his upcoming film Peter the Tramp 1922.

From 1922 to 1924, Greta Gustafsson studied at Dramatens elevskola The Royal Dramatic Theatre's Acting School in Stockholm. There, director Mauritz Stiller, who also worked as a teacher, trained her in cinematic acting, gave her the stage name Greta Garbo, and cast her in a major role in the silent film The Saga of Gosta Berling in 1924, a dramatization of the famous novel by Nobel Prize for Literature Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlf. She played opposite Swedish film actor Lars Hanson. She followed this with a part in the 1925 German film Die freudlose Gasse The Joyless Street or The Street of Sorrow, directed by G. W. Pabst and co-starring Asta Nielsen.

Louis B. Mayer viewed The Saga of Gosta Berling during a visit to Berlin. He was impressed with Stiller's direction, but was more taken with Garbo's acting and screen presence.Citation needed date=July 2010 According to Mayer's daughter, Irene Mayer Selznick, with whom he screened the film, he was impressed by the gentleness and expression that emanated from her eyes.Citation needed date=July 2010 Mayer brought Garbo and Stiller to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

Silent films 19251929
Image:Garbo-Torrent-26.jpg thumb Garbo with Ricardo Cortez in Torrent 1926
Stiller and Garbo arrived in Hollywood in September 1925. Although she expected to work with Stiller on her first film, within a month, Garbo was cast for Torrent 1926 film The Torrent, displacing her senior by 10 years, Aileen Pringle, in the role of Leonora opposite Ricardo Cortez under the direction of Monta Bell. The Torrent did well at the box office despite the fact that it was rather coolly received by the trade press, and Garbo received good reviews.

The success led Irving Thalberg, who at first had pronounced Garbo as absolutely unusable to cast her in a similar vamp role in another Vicente Blasco Ibez Ibez adaptation, The Temptress, this time giving her top billing opposite Antonio Moreno. Her mentor Stiller, who persuaded her to take the part, directed. For both Garbo, who did not like the script any more than she had the first one, and Stiller, The Temptress was a harrowing experience; Garbo remembered it as a picture associated with doom: on the fourth day of production, she received a telegram from Stockholm informing her of the death of her sister Alva at the age of 23.sfn Bainbridge 1955 p=92 MGM did not permit Garbo to return to Sweden for the funeral. Shortly thereafter, Stiller, who spoke little English, had difficulty adapting to the studio system, and did not get on with Moreno, was replaced by Fred Niblo. Reshooting The Temptress was expensive; even though it became one of the top-grossing films of the 192627 season, with nearly US$ 1 million in receipts, it became the only Garbo film of the period to lose money. Garbo herself got very good reviews, and it gave MGM another star.sfn Paris 1995 p=108

The best-receivedWhom? date=March 2011 of Garbo's silent movies were Flesh and the Devil 1926, Love 1927 film Love 1927 and The Mysterious Lady 1928.

Despite her enormous success as a silent movie star, Garbo feared that her Swedish accent might impair her work in sound, and delayed the shift for as long as possible. MGM, for its part, made a slow changeover to sound. Her last silent movie, The Kiss 1929 film The Kiss 1929, was the last film MGM made without dialogue, although it used a soundtrack with music and sound effects only.

Queen of MGM 19301939
Garbo is among the actors and actresses who successfully made the transition to Sound film talkies; publicized with the slogan Garbo talks!, her voice was first heard on screen in Anna Christie 1930 film Anna Christie 1930, a film adaptation of the 1922 play by Eugene O'Neill. The movie was a huge successCitation needed date=March 2011. In 1931, she made a German version of the movie. Garbo next appeared as the World War I spy Mata Hari 1931 film Mata Hari 1931 opposite screen lover Ramon Novarro. She was subsequently part of an all-star cast in Grand Hotel film Grand Hotel 1932 in which she played a Russian people Russian ballerina.
Image:Douglas-Ninotchka.jpg thumb right Garbo and Melvyn Douglas in Ninotchka 1939

After a contract dispute with MGM, she eventually signed a new contract with the studio in July 1932, which gave her more control over her parts and her private life. Garbo demonstrated great loyalty to John Gilbert, whose career was fading, and insisted that he appear with her in 1933's Queen Christina film Queen Christina 1933, despite the objection of MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer; Laurence Olivier had originally been chosen for the role. In 1935, David O. Selznick wanted to cast her as the dying heiress in Dark Victory, but she insisted on doing Leo Tolstoy Tolstoy's Anna Karenina 1935 film Anna Karenina instead. Although Anna Karenina was arguably one of her most famous roles, Garbo regarded her role as the doomed courtesan in George Cukor's Camille 1936 film Camille 1936, opposite Robert Taylor actor Robert Taylor, as her finest performance.

She then starred opposite Melvyn Douglas in Ninotchka 1939, directed by Ernst Lubitsch. Ninotchka attempted to lighten Garbo's somber and melancholy image. The comedy, Garbo's first, was marketed with the tagline Garbo laughs!, playing off the tagline for Anna Christie.

Last films 19401948
The follow-up film, George Cukor's Two-Faced Woman 1941, attempted to capitalize on Garbo's restyled war-time image by casting her in a romantic comedy, in which she played a double role that featured her dancing and tried to portray her as an ordinary girl. The film, Garbo's last, was a critical, although not a commercial, failure, and Garbo referred to the film as my grave.sfn Bainbridge 1955c p=129 She was offered many roles over the years after that, and showed serious interest in about half a dozenbut in each case either she eventually turned the role down, or the projects failed.sfn Bainbridge 1955c p=130

In 1948, Garbo signed a contract for $200,000 with producer Walter Wanger, who had produced Queen Christina film Queen Christina in 1933, to shoot a picture based on Honor de Balzac Balzac's La Duchesse de Langeais which Max Ophls was slated to adapt and direct. Garbo made several screen tests, learned the script and in the summer of 1949 arrived in Rome, where the picture was to be filmed, but financing failed to materialize, and in the end, the project was abandoned.sfn Bainbridge 1955c p=130 These screen teststhe last time Garbo stepped in front of a movie camerawere thought to have been lost for 40 years, before resurfacing in someone's garage. Parts of the screen tests were included in the 2005 Turner Classic Movies TCM documentary Garbo, and show her still radiant at age 43.

Italian motion picture director Luchino Visconti had actively been working on a film adaptation of Marcel Proust Proust's colossal work In Search of Lost Time Remembrance of Things Past since 1969 with a breathtaking prospective cast including Silvana Mangano, Alain Delon, Helmut Berger, Charlotte Rampling, Laurence Olivier and Garbo in the small part of Maria Sophie of Bavaria Maria Sophia, Queen of Naples. Reportedly, Garbo went to Rome and did a color screen test for the role in 1971,sfn Paris 1995 p=460 and Visconti exclaimed:


I am very pleased at the idea that this woman, with her severe and authoritarian presence, should figure in the decadent and rarefied climate of the world described by Proust.


Visconti's dream of making his Proust film came closest to realization in 1971, but with its length of almost four hours, the budget turned out to be astronomical, and the project never came to fruition.

I never said, 'I want to be alone.' I only said, 'I want to be let alone.' There is all the difference.

In 1931, Garbo befriended the writer and socialite Mercedes de Acosta, introduced to her by the author Salka Viertel. According to de Acosta, the pair ultimately began a sporadic and volatile romance, punctuated by long periods during which Garbo ignored her and disregarded her many love letters. After about a year, the relationship ended, but they maintained contact. Due to de Acosta's claims in her controversial 1960 autobiography Here Lies the Heart about her many trysts with Garbo, the pair became permanently estranged.

Harvnb Biery 1928a p=. ...When just a baby, I was always figuring, wondering what it was all about&nbsp; just why we were living.


Harvnb Biery 1928a p=. I hated school. I hated the bonds they put on me. There were so many things outside. I liked history best but I was afraid of the map - geography you call it. But I had to go to go to school like other children. The public school, just as you have in this country.


Harvnb Biery 1928a p=. I didnt play much. Except skating and skiing and throwing snowballs. I did most of my playing by thinking. I played a little with my brother and sister, pretending we were in shows. Like other children. But usually I did my own pretending. I was up and down. Very happy one moment, the next moment  there was nothing left for me.


Harvnb Biery 1928a p=. Then I found a theater. I must have been six or seven. Two theaters, really. One was a cabaret; one a regular theater,  across from one another. And there was a back porch to both of them. A long plank on which the actors and actresses walked to get in the back door. I used to go there at seven oclock in the evening, when they would be coming in, and wait until eight-thirty. Watch them come in; listen to them getting ready. The big back door was always open even in the coldest weather. Listen to their voices doing their parts in the productions. Smell the grase paint! There is no smell in the world like the smell of the backyard of a theater. No smell that will mean as much to me  ever. Night after night, I sat there dreaming. Dreaming when I would be inside  getting ready.


Harvnb Biery 1928a p=. When I wasnt thinking, wasnt wondering what it was all about, this living; I was dreaming. Dreaming how I could become a player.


Harvnb Biery 1928b p=. quote something

-- 

Harvnb Biery 1928c p=. Mr. Stiller is an artist. He does not understand about the American factories. He has always made his own pictures in Europe, where he is the master. In our country it is always the small studio. He does not understand the American Business. He could speak no English. So he was taken off the picture. It was given to Mr. Niblo. How I was broken to pieces, nobody knows. I was so unhappy I did not think I could go on.


Harvnb NYTimes 1936 p=. Garbo refused to write her name for autograph hunters or to pose for newsreels.


Harvnb NYTimes 1936 p=. A woman held out a letter of introduction she said was written by a mutual friend, and Garbo said coldly: I never accept letters.


Harvnb NYTimes 1936 p=. For the first time since she achieved international eminence in the motion-picture world, Miss Garbo granted an interview to the press and received the reporters en masse in the smoking lounge while the ship was at Quarantine.

Harvnb NYTimes 1990 p=. Her penchant for privacy broke all of Hollywood's rules, said her biographer, John Bainbridge. Except at the start of her career, he wrote in Garbo, she granted no interviews, signed no autographs, attended no premieres, answered no fan mail.


Harvnb NYTimes 1990 p=. In a rare statement to reporters she acknowledged, I feel able to express myself only through my roles, not in words, and that is why I try to avoid talking to the press.


Harvnb NYTimes 1990 p=. A declaration often attributed to her was, I want to be alone. Actually she said, I want to be let alone.


Harvnb NYTimes 1990 p=. Garbo's aloofness frustrated the press, which published thousands of photographs of her frantically clutching a drooping hat over her face as she shopped or raced for a train, ship or plane.


Harvnb Bainbridge 1955c p=118. After she had parried questions about Stokowski she was asked if she ever planned to marry. If I could find the right person to share my life withperhaps I would, Garbo answered. Bainbridge quotes from Garbo's surprise interview granted to the press onboard the liner Kungsholm on 7 October 1938 in New York after Garbo had returned from her summer vacation with conductor Leopold Stokowski in Europe.


Harvnb Bainbridge 1955c p=118. About her visits to an infant that had been born on the voyage, she said, I am always very interested in babies. The birth of a baby is always a miracle. Would she like to have children of her own? Garbo shrugged. No. The world now seems much too difficult. ... I would not want to raise a son or any children to go to war. ... Bainbridge quotes from Garbo's surprise interview granted to the press onboard the liner Kungsholm on 7 October 1938 in New York after Garbo had returned from her summer vacation with conductor Leopold Stokowski in Europe.

I had been mildly impressed by her visualeffectiveness. In The Temptress, however, this effectiveness proves positively devastating. She may not be the best actress on the screen. I am powerless to formulate an opinion on her dramatic technique. But there is no room for argument as to the efficacy of her allure... She qualifies herewith as the official Dream Princess of the Silent Drama Department of Life.

They swish the air at least a half-inch beyond her languid orbs. Miss Garbo is not a conventional beauty, yet she makes all other beauties seem a little obvious.

  quote = Hardly since General Douglas MacArthur's I shall return has so momentous a comeback loomed. According to Italian Cinema Director Luchino Visconti, fabled Film Star Greta Garbo, 65, who has been dodging cameras for 30 years, has actually asked to play in his forthcoming movie version of Marcel Proust's seven-volume Remembrance of Things Past. The role that caught her fancy: Maria Sophia, the sixtyish Queen of Naples, who will have only one scene. Nothing has been signed as yet, but Visconti sounded as if Garbo's reappearance was already a fait accompli. Said he: I am very pleased at the idea that this woman, with her severe and authoritarian presence, should figure in the decadent and rarefied climate of the world described by Proust.
