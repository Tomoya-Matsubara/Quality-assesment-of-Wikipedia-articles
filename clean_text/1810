Charity work
1997&lt;U+2013&gt;2000

Muchhal became a member of Kalyanji-Anandji Little Star, a group of young singers, when she was four years old.7 During the Kargil War of 1999, when aged seven, she spent a week singing at shops in her home city, Indore, to raise funds for the families of deceased Indian soldiers. Her efforts received substantial coverage in Indian media and she raised 25,000 (US$810). Later that year, she sang to raise funds for victims of the 1999 Odisha cyclone.8
Her decision to use her voice to help others was triggered when she saw poor children using their clothes to clean train compartments.9 Around the same time, teachers at Nidhi Vinay Mandir, an Indore based school, approached Muchhal and her parents with a request for a charity show to raise funds for their pupil, Lokesh, who was suffering from a congenital heart defect. His father was impoverished footwear shop-owner and was unable to afford the high cost of heart surgery. Muchhal and her parents agreed to arrange a show and in March 2000, she used a street vendor's cart as a stage for the event and collected 51,000 (US$1,600) towards the cost of surgery. The attendant publicity prompted renowned Bangalore-based cardiologist, Devi Prasad Shetty, to operate on Lokesh free of charge. Muchhal's parents published advertisements in local newspapers to promote donations toward heart surgery for children like Lokesh. The outcome of this was a list of 33 children in need of heart surgery.10
A series of charity shows were arranged later in that year, from which 225,000 (US$7,200) were raised. This money was used to provide heart surgery for five children in Bangalore and Indore hospitals. To help Muchhal in her efforts to save lives of children at relatively low cost, T. Choithram Hospital of Indore halved the cost of surgery from 80,000 (US$2,600) to 40,000 (US$1,300) and one of its surgeons, Dhiraj Gandhi, decided to waive his fee for cases brought in by Muchhal.11

 Since 2000, Muchhal has travelled extensively in India and abroad for her charity show, which is billed in Hindi as &quot;Dil se dil tak&quot; (&quot;From heart to heart&quot;) and in English as &quot;Save Little Hearts&quot;. Her younger brother, Palash, performs in the same shows with the intent of raising funds for children who have kidney ailments.12 On average, Muchhal sings around 40 songs in each show which includes popular Bollywood songs, Ghazals and Bhajans. Muchhal can sing in 17 different languages13 which includes Hindi, Sanskrit, Gujarati, Oriya, Assamese, Rajasthani, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Punjabi, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Sindhi and Malayalam.14

By March 2006 this foundation had financially assisted 200 children in undergoing heart surgery.17 By the end of the year 2006 Muchhal had raised  for this foundation which were used to save lives of 234 children. To ensure that operations of children do not stop due to lack of money, Bhandari Hospital in Indore has allowed an overdraft of up to one million rupees to Palak Muchhal Heart Foundation.18 In 2006 Muchhal was one of the five heroic stories broadcast by Star Gold channel as part of its &quot;Rang De Basanti Salaam&quot; (Salute to Color of Sacrifice) initiative.
