is a Japanese-exclusive tactical role-playing game developed and published by Square on July 5, 2001 for the WonderSwan Color and compatible with the WonderSwan.
Unlike standard tactical video games, Blue Wing Blitz focuses on aerial battles, fought with aircraft which can be customized. The events of the game begins in the Esk Republic, in an unnamed fictional world. Esk is threatened by the militaristic empire of Ordia, and the player's party is given the mission to repel the invasion.
Gameplay
 Blue Wing Blitz is a traditional turn-based tactical role-playing game, although it has the particularity of involving mostly airborne units. These are moved on a grid map, and an encounter with an enemy unit opens a separate, close-up combat screen in which up to two ally units and two enemy units engage in a short dogfight; the player using menu commands to attack, change altitude or take evasive maneuvers.12
Different parts of each unit can be damaged, and the success of each attack depends on the units' stats as well as maneuvers. Several ground units are also present on the grid map, and can only be destroyed by bombers.3 The level of fuel and amount of ammunition of each unit are limited and must be replenished when necessary.4
After each mission, aircraft can be upgraded, customized or remodeled with various weapons and equipment developed in factory. Which upgrades are available depends on the player's degree of success in the precedent mission.5
Plot
Setting
The fictional world of Blue Wing Blitz is composed of floating islands, and usage of aircraft is widespread. Most of the islands are owned and ruled by the expansionist Ordia Empire, which possess superior aircraft.6 One of the independent states is the Esk Republic, a rich agrarian nation which supplies food to other countries, such as the United Federation of Roggina or the Kingdoms of Mackai and Peag.7 At the beginning of the game, Trund, the Prime Minister of Esk, assembles a rebel force to reclaim territories menaced by Ordia.8
Characters
 The players controls the members of Esk's rebel force, who each have a distinct aircraft. The main character of the game is a sixteen year-old pilot trainee named Keid, from Tadaga Village, while the second playable character is Payer, a female senior pilot of the same age. She volunteers to defend Tadaga from enemy armies and meets Keid, who becomes enlisted in the rebel force as an officer.9 The third playable character, Havilan, is a veteran piloting a flying gunboat.10
Other playable characters include notably Blore, a strategist and devoted pilot of the royal air force of Mackai; and Rayetta, his younger sister and bomber pilot. Roster, an ally of Ordia who secretly leads the Roggina Spirit resistance also joins the player's party; as does Poty, the fourth prince of Peag and bomber pilot, and his female guard Sersh.11
