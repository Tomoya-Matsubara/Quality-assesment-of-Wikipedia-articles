John Wark (born 4 August 1957) is a Scottish former footballer who spent most of his playing time with Ipswich Town. He won a record four Player of the Year awards before becoming one of the four inaugural members of the club's Hall of Fame. Wark had long spells at the club, which bookended his career, and a third, brief interlude dividing his briefer periods at Liverpool and Middlesbrough. A versatile player, Wark played most of his professional games as a midfielder, although he sometimes played as a central defender and on occasion as a striker.
Born in Glasgow, Wark represented Scotland in international football, winning 29 caps and scoring seven goals. This included selection for Scotland in the 1982 FIFA World Cup in which he made three appearances and scored twice.
During his playing career, Wark appeared in the film Escape to Victory. Since retiring as a professional player in 1996, he has continued to work for Ipswich Town&lt;U+2014&gt;since April 2009 in the corporate hospitality department. His autobiography was published in 2009.
Early life
Wark was born on 4 August 1957, in Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital to parents Alex and Helen. The third of four children, he has an older sister Wilma, older brother Alex and younger brother Andrew.1 The family lived in a four-storey tenement block in Partick. The family was impoverished: Wark's parents could not afford a cot and as a small child, he slept in a drawer from a sideboard.2 Although christened John, Wark was soon referred to by his family as Johnny, a diminutive which stuck throughout his footballing career.3
In the early 1960s, the family moved to another tenement block, this time in Scotstoun, and Wark's father secured employment at nearby Albion Motors. The new home accommodated a back yard in which Wark played football from the age of six. He said &quot;[f]ootball seemed to occupy 99 per cent of my time as a youngster&quot;4 as he tried to emulate his brother Alex, who had become a professional at St. Mirren.5 Wark attended Scotstoun Primary School, where he became captain of the football team. On moving to secondary school, he was selected for the Glasgow Schools representative team.6 He also played for Drumchapel Amateurs at the under-14 level, where he was, for a period, managed by David Moyes' father, also named David.7
During Wark's time at Drumchapel, he attracted the attention of Celtic. He trained with the club at their Parkhead ground, before receiving an invitation to sign schoolboy forms for the club. As a lifelong Rangers fan (with whom Celtic have a notable rivalry)8 and with interest from &quot;several English clubs&quot;, including Bristol City, Manchester City and Ipswich Town, Wark stalled on the offer.9 He trialled with both Ipswich Town and Manchester City, and selected Ipswich when the latter remained non-committal. On arrival at Portman Road, Town manager Bobby Robson, later described by Wark as the person in football &quot;who had the single biggest influence on [him]&quot;,10 personally welcomed him and Wark signed with the club as an apprentice.11
Domestic playing career
First spell at Ipswich
 Wark started his career at Ipswich in the youth team, initially playing at left back before moving to the centre of defence and occasionally occupying the right back position.12 He signed up as a professional for the club on his 17th birthday.13 Selected for the senior squad as a replacement for the injured Kevin Beattie, Wark made his first-team debut on 27 March 1975 in the 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2 FA Cup 6th round (3rd replay) victory over Leeds United;14{{#tag:ref|Ipswich and Leeds United had already featured in three draws in the sixth round of the FA Cup 1974&lt;U+2013&gt;75. The third match was played at Filbert Street, a neutral venue, and the fourth match&lt;U+2014&gt;the third replay&lt;U+2014&gt;at the same location two days later.15|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} the game was played at Leicester City's Filbert Street.16 A nervous and homesick Wark was reassured by manager Robson:

&quot;My debut was in the quarter-final of the FA Cup against the Leeds team of Giles and Bremner. He [Robson] said, 'I wouldn't put you in the team if I didn't think you were good enough'. He was a father figure as well because I was homesick. If it hadn't been for the boss I would have been straight back to Glasgow.&quot;17

Making four more first-team appearances in place of injured regulars, Wark ended the season still on the youth team, and experienced success in the final of the FA Youth Cup, defeating West Ham United 5–1.18 He spent much of the 1975–76 season playing for the reserves, and was presented with the club's Young Player of the Year award, despite making just four appearances for the senior team.19 Moving into midfield, Wark made over 30 appearances in the 1976&lt;U+2013&gt;77 season, scoring his first goals for the club, (10, in all)20 taking over penalty kicking duty; he also received his first red card.21
In the June of 1977, Wark was selected for the Scotland squad for the first time, for a friendly match against East Germany;22 however, a torn hamstring sustained in pre-season training ended any chance of an international debut.23 The injury also kept him out of first-team football until January 1978, when he returned for a match against Cardiff City in the third round of the 1977&lt;U+2013&gt;78 FA Cup.24
Indifferent league performances that season meant that Ipswich finished just three points above the relegation zone,25 but the season ended in success in the FA Cup. Wark scored in a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1 victory over West Bromwich Albion in the semi-final,26 and appeared in the final at Wembley as part of a side that surprised favourites Arsenal,27 winning the game 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0.28 Wark remarked, &quot;We were underdogs but on the day we hammered them.&quot;29 Wark did not touch the ball for the first 18 minutes of the match,30 and as the players left the pitch at half-time, David Geddis said to Wark, &quot;Make sure you hit it between the posts in the second-half. Avoid the white bits.&quot;31 In the second half of the game, Wark &quot;ignored Geddis' advice and hit Pat Jennings' right post twice with almost identical swerving right-foot shots from outside the penalty area&quot;.32
Twice in the three seasons that followed, Ipswich came within one game of winning the League championship, but finished as runners-up to Liverpool and Aston Villa, respectively. However, Ipswich did win the club's only European trophy33 when they lifted the UEFA Cup in 1981. Wark set a competition record by scoring 14 goals&lt;U+2014&gt;including two, one in each leg&lt;U+2014&gt;in the final as Ipswich overcame Dutch side AZ 67 Alkmaar 5&lt;U+2013&gt;4 on aggregate.34 Wark's record equalled the long-standing scoring record in a European competition, set by Jose Altafini of A.C. Milan in the 1962&lt;U+2013&gt;63 European Cup;35{{#tag:ref|The tally was exceeded by Jurgen Klinsmann, who scored 15 in the 1995&lt;U+2013&gt;96 UEFA Cup.36|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} His personal triumph that year was to win a European accolade, Young Player of the Year,37 and gained the acclaim of his fellow professionals in England to earn the PFA Player of the Year award.38 He ended the 1980&lt;U+2013&gt;81 season with 36 goals.39
Wark continued to play for Ipswich, but after Robson left to become England manager in 1982, the side was gradually broken up by new manager Bobby Ferguson.40 Following a rejected demand for a wage increase, Wark submitted a transfer request, which was accepted.41 He signed for Liverpool for &lt;U+00A3&gt;450,000 on 10 March 1984, seen as one of three replacements for Graeme Souness, who was leaving to play for Sampdoria in Italy that summer.42 At the time, Liverpool had won the league title six times, the European Cup three times and the League Cup three times in the preceding eight seasons.43
Liverpool
The medical examination for Wark's transfer somewhat surprised him:

&quot;I was rather taken aback when the doctor entered the Anfield boot room,&quot; Wark said. &quot;He was small in stature and I could not help but detect the smell of alcohol on his breath as he introduced himself to me. I was even more surprised when he announced we would stay put to conduct the medical examination. &quot;He took my blood pressure, looked at the reading and muttered 'that's fine'. Then something happened that to this day I still cannot get over. He asked me to bend down and touch my toes. &quot;Trying not to show my surprise, I did exactly as he asked and as I lifted my head he spoke again, this time to announce 'you've passed'. That was it, my Liverpool medical.&quot;44

Wark made his debut for the club on 31 March 1984 in a 2–0 league win against Watford at Vicarage Road,45 and scored Liverpool's opening goal in the 58th minute.46 Liverpool won the English league title that season, and Wark made sufficient appearances to earn himself a medal.47 His unusual ability as a goalscoring midfielder was on display when he finished the 1984–85 season as the club's top goalscorer, ahead of prolific striker Ian Rush,48 with a tally of 27 goals in 62 appearances—a goal every 2.3 games.49 Wark's season included three hat-tricks, one each in the League, the FA Cup and the European Cup.50 Liverpool qualified for the the 1985 European Cup Final but the match was overshadowed by the Heysel Stadium Disaster, a tragedy Wark remembers as &quot;a nightmare memory&quot;.51
In the 1985–86 season, Wark made 18 appearances, scoring six times,52 but missed out on the club's run-in to their League and FA Cup &quot;double&quot;, due to a broken ankle early in 1986, followed by an Achilles tendon injury.53 He eventually regained his fitness but struggled to regain his place in the Liverpool team until injury to Steve McMahon allowed him back in.54 Wark came on as a late substitute (but according to him, never touched the ball)55 when Liverpool lost the 1987 League Cup Final to Arsenal. No longer a part of manager Kenny Dalglish's plans,56 Wark was sold back to Ipswich on 4 January 1988 for &lt;U+00A3&gt;100,000.57 In spite of more financially lucrative offers from both Watford and Coventry City, he followed Bobby Robson's advice: &quot;Money isn't everything—go where you will be happiest.&quot;58 Wark left the Merseyside club with a record of 42 goals in 108 appearances, a goal every 2.6 games.59
Second spell at Ipswich
Ipswich had been relegated 18 months before Wark's return to the club and were still playing in the second tier of English football.60 During this second spell at Ipswich, Wark was close to being an ever-present in the side: he missed just two games in two seasons.61 He was the club's equal top-scorer in the 1988&lt;U+2013&gt;89 season, sharing the achievement with forwards Dalian Atkinson and Jason Dozzell.62
Following three seasons of mid-table finishes,{{#tag:ref|Including the season before Wark's return to Ipswich.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} manager John Duncan was sacked and replaced by John Lyall.63 With his contract expiring, Wark received what he considered to be a &quot;derisory&quot;64 offer from Lyall, which he declined. Once he became a free agent, Wark signed on a free transfer for Second Division rivals Middlesbrough in August 1990.65 In his two additional seasons with Ipswich, Wark had scored 20 goals,66 and won the club's Player of the Year award in both seasons.67
Middlesbrough
Wark signed for Middlesbrough, the first club to show &quot;a definite interest&quot; in him, on a two-year contract, moving back to play in the centre of defence.68 He made regular appearances and helped the team to seventh place by the end of the season and qualification for the Second Division play-offs.69 Following a 1&lt;U+2013&gt;1 draw with Notts County at Ayresome Park, Wark was informed by manager Colin Todd that he would not be selected for the second leg. Wark was outraged; Middlesbrough lost the second leg 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0.70 Todd departed from the club and was replaced by Lennie Lawrence, who insisted that all players live &quot;within an hour of Ayresome Park&quot;. Wark was still living in Ipswich at the time and following a &quot;sensible agreement&quot; with Lawrence, Wark's contract was terminated and he became a free agent again.71
Third spell at Ipswich
Remaining without a club before the start of the 1991&lt;U+2013&gt;92 season, Wark trained with Ipswich to keep fit, and rejected interest in his services from Leyton Orient, Colchester United and Falkirk.72 When Ipswich suffered a succession of injuries among their defenders, they offered him a contract, initially on a week-by-week basis, before securing a year-long deal.73 Wark made 43 appearances in the first season of his third spell with the club.74 Early results in the season were excellent; the club won seven of their first 11 matches in the league.75 In the FA Cup, Ipswich progressed to a fifth round encounter against Liverpool; when the tie went to a replay at Anfield, Wark received a standing ovation from both sets of fans.76 Ipswich lost the match, and their league form subsided somewhat thereafter, but they were still crowned Second Division champions and were promoted into the newly formed Premier League.77 Wark ended the season as the club's Player of the Year for the third time.78
Wark agreed to a new one-year contract for the 1992&lt;U+2013&gt;93 season and was asked to feature in a Sky Sports advertisement to promote the inaugural Premier League competition.79 Ipswich were the only Premier League club to remain unbeaten after eight games (a sequence that included Wark's first Premier League goal in a 1&lt;U+2013&gt;1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur).80 Ipswich were still in the top six at Christmas, but 13 consecutive games without a win resulted a 16th place finish in the table, just three points above the relegation zone.8182 Wark, now aged 37, secured yet another one-year contract shortly before the end of the 1993&lt;U+2013&gt;94 season. Ipswich were saved from relegation in the last round of matches, courtesy of an injury time goal scored by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, which ensured that Ipswich's fellow strugglers Sheffield United went down.83 Wark went on to be voted the club's Player of the Year for a record fourth time.84
Ipswich and Wark fared worse in the 1994&lt;U+2013&gt;95 season. The club lost 9&lt;U+2013&gt;0 to Manchester United during a season in which Ipswich &quot;recorded fewer victories and suffered more defeats than in any campaign in the club's history&quot;.85 Wark made fewer than 20 appearances in the following season, primarily because of a persistent foot injury.86 Despite his appearance in three more matches in the 1996&lt;U+2013&gt;97 season, and a testimonial against Arsenal at Portman Road, Wark played his last professional match against Tranmere Rovers on 30 November 1996.87 Of a total 826 league matches played by Wark as a professional, he made 679 appearances for Ipswich.88 , he is Ipswich Town's third-highest all-time scorer, with 179 goals scored for the club, despite rarely appearing as a striker.89
International playing career
From 1979, Wark was selected to play for his country, usually as a defender,90 eventually winning 29 caps for Scotland and scoring seven goals.91 Jock Stein was the Scotland manager who gave him his debut, in a game held on 19 May 1979, a British Home Championship match against Wales at Ninian Park; Scotland lost 3&lt;U+2013&gt;0.9293 Wark scored his first international goal a week later on 26 May, again in a British Home Championship game, this time against England at Wembley. Wark's opening effort was not enough, as Scotland were defeated 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1.94
After a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1 home defeat by Belgium in December 1979, Wark was not selected again for his country until February 1981 for the 1982 World Cup qualifying match away against Israel.95 Following a successful qualification campaign,96 Wark was included in the Scotland squad that went to the World Cup in Spain under Stein's leadership.97 Wark played three games and scored two goals,98 both of which were in a single match against New Zealand, a game Scotland won 5&lt;U+2013&gt;2.99 Scotland were knocked out in the group stage.100
Wark's final appearance for Scotland came in September 1984, under Stein;101 he was replaced in favour of Paul McStay at half-time in a 6&lt;U+2013&gt;1 victory over Yugoslavia.102

Personal life
Wark has married twice&lt;U+2014&gt;first to Toula, on 1 July 1981,103 with whom he has a son, Andrew, born in June 1983.104 He married Karen at Gretna Green in April 2009.105 They reside in Onehouse near Stowmarket in Suffolk.106
Film appearance
In 1981, alongside other professional footballers including Bobby Moore and Pel&lt;U+00E9&gt;, Wark was recruited to act in the the Second World War football film Escape to Victory, which starred Sylvester Stallone, Michael Caine and Max Von Sydow.107 Wark played a character called Arthur Hayes,108 but his only line had to be dubbed due to his broad Glaswegian accent.109
Since retirement as a player
Following his retirement from playing football professionally, Wark continued to live in Suffolk, like many other ex-Ipswich players, including Allan Hunter, Mick Mills, Roger Osborne and Mick Lambert.110 Wark told local radio station Heart that &quot;after my retirement from football I made a conscious decision to stay in Ipswich, as it has been my hometown for a major part of my life.&quot;111 Despite his retirement from the professional ranks, Wark continued playing football as an amateur, and signed for Woodbridge Town in 1999 alongside former Ipswich team-mate Paul Mason.112 He also played veterans football for Windsor and Eton,113 played with Soccer AM's Badgers team at the Millennium Stadium,114 and has represented the Liverpool veterans in the Sky Sports Masters series.115
In 2005, Wark was voted as the BBC television programme Football Focus &quot;all-time cult hero&quot; by Ipswich Town fans.116 In 2008 Radio Suffolk announced that he would join their commentary team as a summariser, alongside former team-mates Kevin Beattie and Bryan Hamilton.117 As of April 2009, he works in the corporate hospitality department at Ipswich Town.118
Autobiography
Wark's autobiography Wark On was published on 9 April 2009.119 The book contained material that gained media interest. Wark stated that he made &quot;a small fortune by flogging tickets for the FA Cup Final to a shady underworld ticket tout&quot;.120 &quot;Wark used his share of the cash to help pay for his wedding while a team-mate bankrolled a house extension. He added: &quot;Other teams had done it, so why shouldn&lt;U+2019&gt;t we? Nowadays it&lt;U+2019&gt;s illegal but in those days it was regarded as a perk.&quot;121 The report also highlighted Wark's &quot;dig&quot; at the current &quot;crop of stars&quot; at Anfield. He said: &quot;None of that lot would have been good enough in my time at Anfield.&quot;122
Playing style and personality
Wark played as a central defender,123 midfielder and, occasionally, as a striker.124 Wark was an unusual player; he was able to play as a defensive midfielder yet break forward to score. According to former team-mate Terry Butcher, this was because his colleagues would drop back to cover for him: &quot;I played with John Wark, who was a sitting midfielder but was one of the top scorers in England and Europe. If you see it, then do it, as long as the others spot it and cover for you.&quot;125
Wark was not a &quot;supremely talented&quot; player, but, according to football journalist Jim White, one who espoused team-work and team spirit: &quot;There is no question that the 'one-for-all, all-for-one' mentality generated in the Anfield dressing room was the engine that drove the great team. With players such as Alan Kennedy, John Wark, Sammy Lee and Craig Johnston, nobody could claim this was a collection of top-notch operators in the manner, say, of the current Real Madrid. Every week, they played as an entity greater than the sum of its parts.&quot;126 He has been described as &quot;a defensive midfielder with an astonishing goalscoring record&quot;.127
While playing, Wark retained the ability to be humorous and friendly even with the fiercest of rivals. Former Norwich City goalkeeper, Bryan Gunn, recalls one of his most &quot;memorable derby moments&quot;:

&quot;one of the best was in the ... 1995&lt;U+2013&gt;96 season, when referee Kevin Lynch awarded [Ipswich] Town their second penalty of the game ... John Wark and I were having a bit of a laugh. I asked him where he was going to put his penalty and he said 'In the back of the net'.&quot;128

Wark remained modest and able to take a joke at his own expense, for example in this story recounted by former Scotland team mate, Gordon Strachan:

&quot;Jock ... said to John Wark one day ... 'John, is it fair to say if you're no' scoring goals you're nae use to us?' and John just sat there and said 'aye, have to agree'.&quot;129

Over the years, Wark has become closely associated with his moustache. Owen Slot described the player as &quot;Ipswich's immortal moustache&quot;,130 while Wark himself notes &quot;... it is something of a trademark, even if people are always calling me Bruce ...&quot;131
Honours
In 2006 Wark gained the final place in the poll 100 Players Who Shook The Kop, conducted by the liverpoolfc.tv website.132 The list was compiled as a result of a fan survey: &quot;Over 110,000 supporters all nominated their own personal Top 10 players in order of impact made&quot;.133 In 2007, the Professional Footballers Association polled fans of all Football League clubs, as to &quot;their No 1 player&quot; as part of the &quot;centenary celebrations of the players' union&quot;; Wark was the choice of Ipswich fans.134 In the same year, Wark was one of four Ipswich Town players to be inducted into the club's Hall of Fame.135
