Anna Chlumsky (born December 3, 1980; Chicago, Illinois) is an American actress. She is best-known for playing Vada Sultenfuss in the 1991 movie My Girl and the 1994 sequel My Girl 2. Her cousin, Vik Foxx, is the drummer for The Veronicas. Her father Frank Chlumsky is a culinary instructor for the culinary program at Kendall College in Chicago. Her surname is Czech origin and meaning hill. Pronounced kh-LOOM-skee.
Child acting career
She entered show business at an early age, modeling with her mother in an advertising campaign. She is best known for playing Vada Sultenfuss in the 1991 movie My Girl and the 1994 sequel My Girl 2.
She was in Gold Diggers: The Secret of Bear Mountain with Christina Ricci, and screen tested for the part of 'Lex' in Jurassic Park which eventually went to Ariana Richards.
Columbia Pictures expressed serious interest in My Girl 3 (also known as Still My Girl) and a script has been in development since 2003, according to series co-star Dan Aykroyd. Aykroyd revealed in media outlets that Columbia was attempting to sign Chlumsky for the role.1 The project is still in development stages, with no current updates in seven years.
Hiatus from acting and return
Chlumsky never intended for acting to be her life-long career. As a child she considered working with horses or in paleontology. Once she reached adulthood, roles became scarce and she began to move away from acting. She attended the University of Chicago, majoring in International Studies, and graduated with a BA degree in 2002. During this time she ceased paying dues to the Screen Actors Guild. After graduation she worked as a fact-checker for the Zagat Survey and served as an editorial assistant for a HarperCollins science fiction-fantasy imprint. She came to find this work unsatisfying and decided she wanted to return to acting. She went to the Atlantic Acting School in Manhattan to receive more formal training (in her youth she deemed herself &quot;a natural,&quot; so had not had as much formal training) and currently indicates that acting is the career she wants for life.2
Career in adulthood
Chlumsky appeared on the March 8, 2007 episode of 30 Rock called &quot;The Fighting Irish&quot;. She played the character &quot;Liz Lemler&quot;. She also appeared as &quot;Mary Calvin&quot; in an episode of the NBC drama series Law &amp; Order (Season 17, Episode 12) first airing January 12, 2007. She was also in three episodes of the ABC dramedy Cupid.
Chlumsky starred in the Off Broadway production of Unconditional by Brett C. Leonard at The Public Theater. It was produced by Philip Seymour Hoffman's theater group, LAByrinth Theater Company, which opened on February 2008.
She appeared in the BBC Films political satire In The Loop, co-starring with The Sopranos' James Gandolfini.3 She plays Liza, a State Department assistant in the movie directed by Armando Iannucci.
She appeared as &quot;Lisa Klein&quot; in an episode of the NBC drama series Law &amp; Order (Season 20, Episode 16) first airing March 15, 2010.4
On December 3, 2010 it was announced that Anna Chlumsky has signed on to play the chief of staff of Julia Louis-Dreyfus's vice president in Veep.5
