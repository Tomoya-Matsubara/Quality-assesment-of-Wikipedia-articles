Leo Phokas () was an early 10th-century Byzantine general of the noble Phokas clan. He was defeated in his campaigns against the Bulgarians, and was unsuccessful in his struggle for the throne with Romanos Lekapenos. After Lekapenos seized control of the Empire, Leo led an unsuccessful revolt, and was captured and blinded.
Life
Leo was the son of Nikephoros Phokas the Elder, an eminent Byzantine general who had distinguished himself in southern Italy. His brother, Bardas, was also a senior general, as were Bardas' sons Nikephoros and Leo. Nikephoros eventually became emperor in 963&lt;U+2013&gt;969.12 Little is known about Leo's early life. During the late reign of Leo VI the Wise (r. 886&lt;U+2013&gt;912) he married the sister of Constantine the Paphlagonian, the emperor's powerful parakoimomenos, and rose to the post of Domestic of the Schools.3 Although personally brave and not without some measure of success against the Arabs in the East, his ability as a general was rather limited. Steven Runciman attributed his rise more to his aristocratic origin and his familial connection with the parakoimomenos Constantine.4
 During the regency of Empress Zoe in 913&lt;U+2013&gt;919, he is recorded as being again Domestic of the Schools and holding the dignity of magistros. In 917, he was placed in charge of a large-scale expedition against the Bulgarians. The plan involved a two-pronged assault, one from the south by the main Byzantine army under Leo Phokas, and one from the north by the Pechenegs, who were to be ferried across the Danube by the Byzantine navy under Romanos Lekapenos. In the event however, the Pechenegs did nor abide by the plan and did not help the Byzantines, who suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the Tsar Symeon at the Battle of Acheloos. The imperial army was almost annihilated, and Phokas himself barely escaped. As Symeon marched south towards Constantinople, he gathered a motley force and attempted to halt his advance, but was again defeated by Symeon in a surprise night attack at Katasyrtai.567
These military disasters weakened the regency of Zoe, and rumours began to circulate that Phokas, whose army lay encamped across the Bosporus, and his brother-in-law Constantine the Paphlagonian were planning to seize the throne from the young Constantine VII (r. 913&lt;U+2013&gt;959). According to Runciman, Zoe herself may have planned planned to marry the general and solidify her own position. The emperor's tutor however, a certain Theodore, turned to Romanos Lekapenos; although he carried a great share of the blame for the failure of the Bulgarian campaign, Romanos' fleet was intact and at hand.89 The parakoimomenos Constantine tried to neutralize this threat by disbanding the fleet, but he was arrested by Lekapenos when he arrived to supervise the payment of the crews. With this strike, Zoe lost all control of the situation. At Theodore's urging, the young emperor appointed the Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos as regent. The Patriarch's first act was to dismiss Leo Phokas from his post as Domestic and replace him with John Garidas.101112
 Leo tried to secure his position by forcing the Patriarch to appoint some of his relatives to command the Hetaireia, the imperial bodyguard. The patriarch at first agreed, but almost immediately dismissed them. At this point Leo turned to Lekapenos, and offered a marriage alliance. Lekapenos agreed and swore alliance with him, but on 25 March 919 he managed to gain entrance to the imperial palace, occupying it and securing his appointment as magistros and commander of the Hetaireia, while a few weeks after, he married his daughter Helena to the young emperor and assumed the title of basileopator.1314
Leo Phokas was sent a letter, in the emperor's name, in which he was bidden not to react to these events. Inevitably, the outmaneuvered Leo rose in revolt, but failed to secure the loyalty of his troops: they began to desert to the imperial camp, especially after a letter from the young Constantine VII, which acclaimed Lekapenos as his protector and denounced Leo's rebellion, reached the rebel camp. Eventually, Leo was forced to flee, but was captured and blinded by the emperor's agents in Bithynia. Following the discovery of a plot by some of his friends a few months later, Phokas suffered a final humiliation, being paraded through the streets of Constantinople on a mule. His fate thereafter is unknown.151617
