Hindi (Devanagari:  or , IAST: , ), an Indo-European language spoken mainly in northern and central India, is one of the official languages of the Union government of India.12 It is part of a dialect continuum of the Indic family, bounded on the northwest and west by Punjabi, Sindhi, Urdu, and Gujarati; on the south by Marathi and Konkani; on the southeast by Oriya; on the east by Bengali; and on the north by Nepali. Hindi also refers to a standardized register of Hindustani termed khariboli, that emerged as the standard dialect. The grammatical description in this article concerns this standard Hindi.
Classification
Hindi is classified as a language belonging to the Indo-European family of languages. It comes under the Indo-Aryan division of the Indo-Iranian branch of this family of languages.
Etymology
Of Persian origin, the word Hind&lt;U+012B&gt; (&lt;U+06C1&gt;&lt;U+0646&gt;&lt;U+062F&gt;&lt;U+06CC&gt;) is comprised of Hind &quot;India&quot;, and the adjectival suffix &lt;U+012B&gt;. Hence Hind&lt;U+012B&gt; translates to &quot;Indian&quot;. In modern times, Hind&lt;U+012B&gt; as taken to mean &quot;Indian&quot; is chiefly obsolete; it now specifically refers to the language bearing that name.3
Demographics
Area
Hindi is the predominant language in the states and union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. Linguistic scholars refer to this area as the Hindi belt. Outside these areas, Hindi is widely spoken in cities like Mumbai, Chandigarh, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad, all of which have their own native languages but harbour large communities of people from various parts of India.
Local variations of Hindi are counted as minority languages in several countries, including Fiji, Mauritius, Guyana, Suriname, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK among various other countries around the world.
Number of speakers
Hindi is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. According to the census of India4 (which encompasses all the dialects of Hindi, including those that might be considered separate languages by some linguists&lt;U+2014&gt;e.g., Bhojpuri), Hindi is the mother tongue of about 337 million Indians, or about 40% of India's population that year. According to SIL International's Ethnologue,5 about 180 million people in India regard standard (Khari Boli) Hindi as their mother tongue, and another 300 million use it as a second language. Outside India, Hindi speakers number around 8 million in Nepal, 890,000 in South Africa, 685,000 in Mauritius, 317,000 in the U.S.,6 233,000 in Yemen, 147,000 in Uganda, 30,000 in Germany, 20,000 in New Zealand and 5,000 in Singapore, while the UK and UAE also have notable populations of Hindi speakers. Hence, according to the SIL ethnologue (1999 data), Hindi/Urdu is the fifth most spoken language in the world. According to Comrie (1998 data),7 Hindi is the second most spoken language in the world, with 333 million native speakers.
Because of Hindi's extreme similarity to Urdu, speakers of the two languages can usually understand one another, if both sides refrain from using specialized vocabulary. Indeed, linguists sometimes count them as being part of the same language diasystem. However, Hindi and Urdu are socio-politically different, and people who self-describe as being speakers of Urdu would question their being counted as native speakers of Hindi, and vice-versa.
Official and social status
Official status
The Constitution of India, adopted in 1950, declares Hindi in the Devanagari script as the &quot;official language () of the Union&quot; (Article 343(1)).8 Hindi is also enumerated as one of the twenty-two languages of the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India, which entitles it to representation on the Official Language Commission.9 It was envisioned that Hindi would become the sole working language of the central government by 1965, with state governments being free to function in languages of their own choice. This has not, however, happened and English is also used along with Hindi for official purposes. There was widespread resistance to the imposition of Hindi on non-native speakers, in some states, especially the Anti-Hindi agitations in the state of Tamil Nadu, which resulted in the passage of the Official Languages Act (1963). This act provided for the continued use of English, indefinitely, for all official purposes, by the Union government. However, the constitutional directive to the central government to champion the spread of Hindi was retained and has strongly influenced the policies of the Union government.
At the state level, Hindi is the official language of the following states: Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, and Delhi. Each of these states may also designate a &quot;co-official language&quot;; in Uttar Pradesh for instance, depending on the political formation in power, sometimes this language is Urdu. Similarly, Hindi is accorded the status of co-official language in several states.
Social status
While the Union government has sedulously promoted the spread of Hindi, its official status is not reflected in social importance. As with other south Asian language groups, even native speakers of Hindi, if elite, are usually fluent in English. Education in English is a prerequisite for social status&lt;U+2014&gt;hence the existence of several English medium &quot;public&quot; (actually private) and Christian missionary schools in India. English remains the sole language of higher education in many of the fields of learning such as Engineering, Medicine and Science. There were numerous pro-Hindi agitations in the so-called Hindi belt as a reaction to the anti-Hindi agitations in Tamil Nadu during the 1960s, but the movement de facto called for an expurgation of English (being a foreign language, sic) rather than actual promotion of Hindi.
Since the elite can use English, Hindi has been particularly weak on the Internet. As a barometer, the Devanagari fonts and keyboards used on computers today were not standardized within India - earlier government standards such as the 8-bit ISCII (Indian Script Code for Information Interchange) or the GIST keyboard were never widely adopted. The present system was finally standardized only during Unicode deliberations. Indeed, Hindi unicode standards were finalised based on inputs from scholars hailing from Fiji and other countries. It is only when Unicode became the dominant standard that a number of changes were sought by the Indian government.
At the informal level (as between friends, colleagues and co-workers, and in entertainment, films, etc.), the use of Hindi has been growing, even among non-native speakers. Hindi is often used if the speakers in question hail from different linguistic provinces, especially if they belong to a social stratum that has not accessed a very good English education, and often even otherwise. Hindi movies have been playing a substantial role in popularizing the language all over the country. Popular Hindi TV serials do the same today. Seeing the popularity of Hindi, BBC World Service started News in Hindi in 1940; and more recently Yahoo and Google have both launched portals in Hindi.
History

Hindi evolved from Sanskrit, by way of the Middle Indo-Aryan Prakrit languages and Apabhramsha of the Middle Ages. There is no consensus for a specific time where the modern north Indian languages such as Hindi emerged, but c. 1000 AD is commonly accepted.10 In the span of nearly a thousand years of Muslim influence, such as when Muslim rulers controlled much of northern India during the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire, many Persian and Arabic words were borrowed into Hindi. All Arabic words were loaned into Hindi via Persian, and hence do not preserve the original phonology of Arabic (Tiwari [1955] 2004).
Hindi is often contrasted with Urdu, another standardised form of Hindustani that is the official language of Pakistan and also an official language in some parts of India. The primary differences between the two are that Standard Hindi is written in Devanagari and draws its vocabulary with words from (Indo-Aryan) Sanskrit, while Urdu is written in Nastaliq script, a variant of the (Semitic) Perso-Arabic script, and draws heavily on Persian and Arabic vocabulary.
Standard Hindi
After independence, the Government of India worked on standardizing Hindi, instituting the following changes:

standardization of Hindi grammar: In 1954, the Government of India set up a committee to prepare a grammar of Hindi; The committee's report was released in 1958 as &quot;A Basic Grammar of Modern Hindi&quot;
standardization of Hindi spelling
standardization of the Devan&lt;U+0101&gt;gar&lt;U+012B&gt; script by the Central Hindi Directorate of the Ministry of Education and Culture to bring about uniformity in writing and to improve the shape of some Devanagari characters.
scientific mode of transcribing the Devanagari alphabet
incorporation of diacritics to express sounds from other languages.

Vocabulary

Standard Hindi derives much of its formal and technical vocabulary from Sanskrit. Standard or shuddh (&quot;pure&quot;) Hindi is used only in public addresses and radio or TV news, while the everyday spoken language in most areas is one of several varieties of Hindustani, whose vocabulary contains words drawn from Persian and Arabic. In addition, spoken Hindi includes words from English and other languages as well.
Vernacular Urdu and Hindi are practically indistinguishable. However, the literary registers differ substantially; in highly formal situations, the languages are barely intelligible to speakers of the other. It bears mention that in centuries past both Sanskrit and Persian have been regarded as the languages of the elite, even by those of differing ethnic and religious backgrounds.
There are three principal categories of words in Standard Hindi:

Tatsam (&lt;U+0924&gt;&lt;U+0924&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;&lt;U+0938&gt;&lt;U+092E&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;) words: These are the words which have been directly lifted from Sanskrit to enrich the formal and technical vocabulary of Hindi. Such words (almost exclusively nouns) have been taken without any phonetic or spelling change. Among nouns, the tatsam word could be the Sanskrit uninflected word-stem, or it could be the nominative singular form in the Sanskrit nominal declension.
Tadbhav (&lt;U+0924&gt;&lt;U+0926&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;&lt;U+092D&gt;&lt;U+0935&gt;) words: These are the words that might have been derived from Sanskrit or the Prakrits, but have undergone minor or major phonetic and spelling changes as they appear in modern Hindi.
Deshaj (&lt;U+0926&gt;&lt;U+0947&gt;&lt;U+0936&gt;&lt;U+091C&gt;) words: These are words of local origin.

Similarly, Urdu treats its own vocabulary, borrowed directly from Persian and Arabic, as a separate category for morphological purposes.
Hindi from which most of the Persian, Arabic and English words have been ousted and replaced by tatsam words is called Shuddha Hindi (pure Hindi). Chiefly, the proponents of the so-called Hindutva (&quot;Hindu-ness&quot;) are vociferous supporters of Shuddha Hindi.
Excessive use of tatsam words sometimes creates problems for most native speakers. Strictly speaking, the tatsam words are words of Sanskrit and not of Hindi&lt;U+2014&gt;thus they have complicated consonantal clusters which are not linguistically valid in Hindi. The educated middle class population of India can pronounce these words with ease, but people of rural backgrounds have much difficulty in pronouncing them. Similarly, vocabulary borrowed from Persian and Arabic also brings in its own consonantal clusters and &quot;foreign&quot; sounds, which may again cause difficulty in speaking them.
Sociolinguistics of Hindi
Variants
Sociolinguists have traditionally given what they call as four major variants or styles (&lt;U+0936&gt;&lt;U+0948&gt;&lt;U+0932&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt;) of Hindi, viz.,11

High Hindi, the standardized Hindi (based on the Khariboli dialect), written in Devanagari script, which contains numerous Sanskrit loanwords, including those introduced more recently to enrich the technical and poetical vocabulary or to replace words of Perseo-Arabic origin. Traditionally, this is the register spoken by the urban Hindu population of north India and is the form of Hindi taught in Indian schools and used in television news and newspapers. Today, High Hindi with many Persian, Arabic and English loanwords is the spoken form of this language in much of the north India, and is used in Hindi films, drama and television serials.
Dakhini, spoken in the Deccan plateau region in and around Hyderabad, similar to Urdu but with fewer words derived from Perso-Arabic in its vocabulary.
Rekhta, a form of Urdu used in poetry.
Urdu, a language of prestige in its own right but whose development is closely tied to that of Hindi (and also based on the Khariboli dialect), written in Perso-Arabic script. It utilizes a more extensive Persian and Arabic vocabulary and fewer Sanskrit loanwords, especially in its formal register. Before the Partition of India, Urdu's linguistic area was similar to that of High Hindi and it was considered the language of choice for the majority of educated middle classes - both Hindu and Muslim - until political currents and lingusitic nationalism post-partition encouraged a more pronounced divide between the two varieties of Khariboli.

Additionally, Hindustani is generally coined for the neutral style that is in-between High Hindi and Urdu and used in common speech.
Dialects (&quot;Mother Tongues&quot;)
Hindi in the broad sense (formerly referred to as &quot;Hindustani&quot;; now often referred to as &quot;Hindi-Urdu&quot;) is a dialect continuum without clear boundaries. For example, both Nepali and Punjabi are sometimes considered to be Hindi (based on the high level of mutual intelligibility for Punjabi and Hindi especially), though they are more often considered to be separate languages. Hindi is often divided into Western Hindi and Eastern Hindi, and these are further divided. Following is a list of principal Hindi dialects; many linguists regard only the dialects under Western and Eastern Hindi as proper Hindi dialects, and the rest as separate languages or sub-languages. The following listing is taken from Tiwari ([1966] 2004); even he notes that the classification of the dialects under various branches and their classification as a dialect of Hindi or as an independent language depends upon the perception of the linguist.
Hindi region of the Indian subcontinent
This region includes the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chandigarh, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand. Some people, such as the Government of India (while taking census) regard all the languages spoken in these states to be &quot;mother tongues&quot; of Hindi (barring tribal languages). Tiwari ([1966] 2004) lists them under five groups:

Western Hindi (the speech varieties developed from Sauraseni):

Khari boli (&lt;U+0916&gt;&lt;U+0921&gt;&lt;U+093C&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt; &lt;U+092C&gt;&lt;U+094B&gt;&lt;U+0932&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt;) or Sarhindi or Kauravi, originally spoken in western Uttar Pradesh (the districts of Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Bijnor, Rampur and Moradabad, and district of Dehradun in Uttarakhand) and the Delhi region; the dialect that forms the basis of modern Standard Hindi. It is understood and/or spoken throughout the Indian subcontinent, from Afghanistan, the borders of Iran, to the borders of Burma, and in the south, it is understood in Sri Lanka. It is the almost the lingua franca of the Indian subcontinent, irrespective of political boundaries or official policies. This is not a great difference between the dialects of Khari-boli and Hindustani.
Braj Bhasha (&lt;U+092C&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;&lt;U+0930&gt;&lt;U+091C&gt; &lt;U+092D&gt;&lt;U+093E&gt;&lt;U+0937&gt;&lt;U+093E&gt;), spoken in south-central Uttar Pradesh, in the districts of Mathura, Agra, Aligarh, Dhaulpur, Mainpuri, Etah, Badaun and Bareilly. It has a rich poetic and literal tradition, especially linked with the Hindu divinity Krishna.
Hariyanvi (&lt;U+0939&gt;&lt;U+0930&gt;&lt;U+093F&gt;&lt;U+092F&gt;&lt;U+093E&gt;&lt;U+0923&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt;), spoken in the state of Haryana.
Bundeli (&lt;U+092C&gt;&lt;U+0941&gt;&lt;U+0928&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;&lt;U+0926&gt;&lt;U+0947&gt;&lt;U+0932&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt;), the speech varieties of the districts of Jhansi, Jalaun and Hamirpur in Uttar Pradesh and Gwalior, Bhopal, Sagar, Chhatarpur, Narsinghpur, Seoni, Hoshangabad, etc. in Madhya Pradesh.
Kannauji (&lt;U+0915&gt;&lt;U+0928&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;&lt;U+0928&gt;&lt;U+094C&gt;&lt;U+091C&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt;), the dialect of the districts of Etawah, Farrukhabad, Shahjahanpur, Kanpur, Hardoi and Pilibhit in Uttar Pradesh.

Eastern Hindi (the speech varieties developed from Ardhamagadhi)

Awadhi (&lt;U+0905&gt;&lt;U+0935&gt;&lt;U+0927&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt;), spoken in central and parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh, in the districts of Allahabad, Fatehpur, Mirzapur, Unnao, Raebareli, Sitapur, Faizabad, Gonda, Basti, Bahraich, Sultanpur, Pratapgarh and Barabanki. The famous Hindu scripture Ramcharitmanas was written by Tulsidas in this dialect.
Bagheli (&lt;U+092C&gt;&lt;U+0918&gt;&lt;U+0947&gt;&lt;U+0932&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt;), spoken in the districts of Rewa, Nagod, Shahdol, Satna, Maihar, etc. in Madhya Pradesh.
Chattisgarhi (&lt;U+091B&gt;&lt;U+0924&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;&lt;U+0924&gt;&lt;U+093F&gt;&lt;U+0938&gt;&lt;U+0917&gt;&lt;U+0922&gt;&lt;U+093C&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt;), spoken mostly in the recently created state of Chhattisgarh

Rajasthani, mostly spoken in the state of Rajasthan, and also comprised of several notable (sub)dialects:

Western Rajasthani or Marwari (&lt;U+092E&gt;&lt;U+093E&gt;&lt;U+0930&gt;&lt;U+0935&gt;&lt;U+093E&gt;&lt;U+0921&gt;&lt;U+093C&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt;)
Eastern Rajasthani or Jaipuri (&lt;U+091C&gt;&lt;U+092F&gt;&lt;U+092A&gt;&lt;U+0941&gt;&lt;U+0930&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt;)
Northern Rajasthani or Mewati (&lt;U+092E&gt;&lt;U+0947&gt;&lt;U+0935&gt;&lt;U+093E&gt;&lt;U+0924&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt;)
Southern Rajasthani or Mewari (&lt;U+092E&gt;&lt;U+0947&gt;&lt;U+0935&gt;&lt;U+093E&gt;&lt;U+0921&gt;&lt;U+093C&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt;)
Malwi (&lt;U+092E&gt;&lt;U+093E&gt;&lt;U+0932&gt;&lt;U+0935&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt;) spoken in Western-southern Madhya Pradesh.

Pahari (&lt;U+092A&gt;&lt;U+0939&gt;&lt;U+093E&gt;&lt;U+0921&gt;&lt;U+093C&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt;), the speech varieties of the Himalayan mountains

Eastern Pahari, which includes Nepali, now considered a separate language
Central Pahari, which includes Garhwali and Kumauni sub-dialects of the newly created state of Uttarakhand.
Western Pahari, which includes the several sub-dialects spoken in Himachal Pradesh state.

Bihari (traditionally thought to be dialects of Hindi, contra linguistic evidence that these languages descendant of Eastern Group of Indic languages, along with Bengali, Assamese, and Oriya.)

Bhojpuri (&lt;U+092D&gt;&lt;U+094B&gt;&lt;U+091C&gt;&lt;U+092A&gt;&lt;U+0941&gt;&lt;U+0930&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt;), which is spoken in eastern Uttar Pradesh (districts of Gorakhpur, Deoria, Mirzapur, Varanasi, Jaunpur, Ghazipur, Ballia), western Bihar (districts of Chhapra, Siwan, Gopalganj and Bhojpur) and a small part of Jharkhand (districts Palamu and Ranchi). Some linguists like Dr. Chatterji consider it so different from the other two Bihari dialects that they prefer keeping it outside the Bihari group.
Maithili (&lt;U+092E&gt;&lt;U+0948&gt;&lt;U+0925&gt;&lt;U+093F&gt;&lt;U+0932&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt;), spoken in the Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi, East Champaran, Munger, Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, Purnia and North Santhal Pargana districts of Bihar and Tarai of Nepal. It was included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian constitution in January 2004 and is officially considered an independent language.
Magahi/Magadhi (&lt;U+092E&gt;&lt;U+0917&gt;&lt;U+0939&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt; / &lt;U+092E&gt;&lt;U+0917&gt;&lt;U+0927&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt;), spoken in the districts of Gaya, Patna, Munger and Bhagalpur in Bihar state and Palamu, Hazaribagh and Ranchi in Jharkhand state.


Depending upon perceptions, people also include various other dialects under Hindi, such as Nimari, Baiswari, Vajjika, Angika, etc.
Non-Hindi regions in the Indian subcontinent

Bambaiya Hindi, the dialect of the city of Bombay (Mumbai); it is based on Khariboli dialect, but heavily influenced by Konkani, Marathi and Gujarati. Technically it is a pidgin, i.e., neither is it a mother language of any people nor is it used in formal settings by the educated and upper social strata. However, it is often used in the movies of Hindi cinema (Urdu) (Bollywood), where it often gives a comical effect on the movie characters.
Dakhini, as discussed above.
Kalkatiya Hindi, another Khariboli-based pidgin spoken in the city of Calcutta (Kolkata), Shillong, etc., heavily influenced by Bhojpuri and Bengali.
Arunachal Hindi is a regional dialect of HIndi popularly spoken in Hindi. This is an amalmagation of Hindi and the various tribal dialects of the state. Words such as 'Yamtar', meaning pickle are spoken instead of achaar and so on. Arunachal Hindi is the most popular language spoken in Arunachal Pradesh even in the most remote parts of the state.

Outside the Indian subcontinent

Tadj-Uzbeki, a term coined by Tiwari ([1966] 2004), for the dialect spoken by Indian immigrants from 13th century onwards in the border region of Tadjikistan and Uzbekistan (towns of Hisar, Shehr-e-nau, Regar, Surchi, etc). It seems to be based on the Braj, Hariyani and Rajasthani dialects, and is of course highly influenced by Uzbek, Tadjik and Russian languages.
Mauritian Hindi, spoken in Mauritius, based on Bhojpuri and influenced by French.
Sarnami, a form of Bhojpuri with Awadhi influence spoken by Surinamers of Indian descent.
Fiji Hindi, a form of Awadhi spoken by Fijians of Indian descent.
Trinidad Hindi, based on Bhojpuri, and spoken in Trinidad and Tobago by people of Indian descent.
South African Hindi, based on Bhojpuri, and spoken in South Africa by people of Indian descent.
Though Chinese Mandarin is forced upon the Tibetans through the education system, it is Hindi that is popular, spoken and understood widely by the Tibetan traders of Lhasa, and along the area of Tibet bordering India, which is thousands of miles.

Hindi and Urdu
The term Urdu arose in 1645. Until then, and even after 1645, the term Hindi or Hindvi was used in a general sense for the dialects of central and northern India.
There are two fundamental distinctions between Standard Urdu and Standard Hindi that lead to their being recognised as distinct languages:

the source of borrowed vocabulary (Persian/Arabic for Urdu and Sanskrit for Hindi); and
the script used to write them in (for Urdu, an adaptation of the Perso-Arabic alphabet written in Nasta'liq style; for Hindi, an adaptation of the Devanagari script).

Colloquially and linguistically, the distinction between the Urdu and Hindi is nearly meaningless. This is true over much of the northern half of the Indian subcontinent, wherever neither learned vocabulary nor writing is used. Outside the Delhi dialect area, the term &quot;Hindi&quot; may be used in reference to the local dialect, which may be very different from both Hindi and Urdu.
The word Hindi has many different uses; confusion of these is one of the primary causes of debate about the identity of Urdu. These uses include:

standardized Hindi as taught in schools throughout India,
formal or official Hindi advocated by Purushottam Das Tandon and as instituted by the post-independence Indian government, heavily influenced by Sanskrit,
the vernacular nonstandard dialects of Hindustani/Hindi-Urdu as spoken throughout much of India and Pakistan, as discussed above,
the neutralized form of the language used in popular television and films, or
the more formal neutralized form of the language used in broadcast and print news reports.

The rubric &quot;Hindi&quot; is often used as a catch-all for those idioms in the North Indian dialect continuum that are not recognized as languages separate from the language of the Delhi region. Panjabi, Bihari, and Chhatisgarhi, while sometimes recognised as being distinct languages, are often considered dialects of Hindi. Many other local idioms, such as the Bhili languages, which do not have a distinct identity defined by an established literary tradition, are almost always considered dialects of Hindi. In other words, the boundaries of &quot;Hindi&quot; have little to do with mutual intelligibility, and instead depend on social perceptions of what constitutes a language.
The other use of the word &quot;Hindi&quot; is in reference to Standard Hindi, the Khari boli register of the Delhi dialect of Hindi (generally called Hindustani) with its direct loanwords from Sanskrit. Standard Urdu is also a standardized form of Hindustani. Such a state of affairs, with two standardized forms of what is essentially one language, is known as a diasystem.
Urdu was earlier called Zab&lt;U+0101&gt;n-e-Urd&lt;U+016B&gt;-e-Mu&lt;U+2019&gt;allah (&lt;U+0632&gt;&lt;U+0628&gt;&lt;U+0627&gt;&lt;U+0646&gt;&lt;U+0650&gt; &lt;U+0627&gt;&lt;U+0631&gt;&lt;U+062F&gt;&lt;U+0648&gt;&lt;U+0650&gt; &lt;U+0645&gt;&lt;U+0639&gt;&lt;U+0644&gt;&lt;U+06C1&gt;, &lt;U+091C&gt;&lt;U+093C&gt;&lt;U+092C&gt;&lt;U+093E&gt;&lt;U+0928&gt;-&lt;U+0910&gt; &lt;U+0909&gt;&lt;U+0930&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;&lt;U+0926&gt;&lt;U+0942&gt;), lit., the &quot;Exalted Language of the Camp&quot;. Earlier, terms Hindi and Urdu were used interchangeably even by Urdu poets like Mir and Mirza Ghalib of the early 19th century (rather, the terms Hindvi/Hindi was used more often). By 1850, Hindi and Urdu were no longer used for the same language. Other linguists such as Sir G. A. Grierson (1903) have also claimed that Urdu is simply a dialect or style of Western Hindi. Before the Partition of India, Delhi, Lucknow, Aligarh and Hyderabad used to be the four literary centers of Urdu &lt;U+2014&gt; none of which lie in present Pakistan.
The colloquial language spoken by the people of Delhi is indistinguishable by ear, whether it is called Hindi or Urdu by its speakers. The only important distinction at this level is in the script: if written in the Perso-Arabic script, the language is generally considered to be Urdu, and if written in devanagari it is generally considered to be Hindi. However, since independence the formal registers used in education and the media have become increasingly divergent in their vocabulary. Where there is no colloquial word for a concept, Standard Urdu uses Perso-Arabic vocabulary, while Standard Hindi uses Sanskrit vocabulary. This results in the official languages being heavily Sanskritized or Persianized, and nearly unintelligible to speakers educated in the other standard (as far as the formal vocabulary is concerned).
These two standardized registers of Hindustani have become so entrenched as separate languages that many extreme-nationalists, both Hindu and Muslim, claim that Hindi and Urdu have always been separate languages. The tensions reached a peak in the Hindi-Urdu controversy in 1867 in the then United Provinces during the British Raj. However, there were and are unifying forces as well. For example, it is said that Indian Bollywood films are made in &quot;Hindi&quot;, but the language used in most of them is the same as that of Urdu speakers in Pakistan. The dialogue is frequently developed in English and later translated to an intentionally neutral Hindustani which can be easily understood by speakers of most North Indian languages, both in India itself and in Pakistan.

Additional notes on vowels

The short open-mid front unrounded vowel (: as e in get) can occur as a conditioned allophone of schwa. Thus, the pronunciation of the vowel &lt;U+0905&gt; occurs in two forms. When this vowel is followed by word-middle /h/, or it surrounds word-middle /h/, or is followed by word-ending /h/, it changes allophonically to short . In all other cases it is the mid central vowel schwa. Thus, the following words &lt;U+0936&gt;&lt;U+0939&gt;&lt;U+0930&gt;, &lt;U+0930&gt;&lt;U+0939&gt;&lt;U+0928&gt;&lt;U+093E&gt;, &lt;U+0915&gt;&lt;U+0939&gt; are pronounced as ,  and  and not as ,  and . It also occurs in loanwords from English, where it is sometimes accorded a new vowel symbol of &lt;U+090D&gt; (candra: &lt;U+092A&gt;&lt;U+0945&gt;). e.g., pen: &lt;U+092A&gt;&lt;U+0945&gt;&lt;U+0928&gt;.
The short open back rounded vowel (: as o in hot), does not exist in Hindi at all, other than for English loanwords. In orthography, a new symbol has been invented for it: &lt;U+0911&gt; (&lt;U+092A&gt;&lt;U+0949&gt;). If included in Hindi phonology, it brings the number of phonemic vowels to 11.
There are some additional vowels traditionally listed in the Hindi alphabet. They are

&lt;U+090B&gt; (originally in Sanskrit a vowel-like syllabic retroflex approximant), pronounced in modern Hindi as , used only in Sanskrit loanwords (&lt;U+092A&gt;&lt;U+0943&gt;).
&lt;U+0905&gt;&lt;U+0902&gt; (called anusv&lt;U+0101&gt;ra), pronounced as /&lt;U+0259&gt;&lt;U+014B&gt;/. Its diacritic (the dot above) is used for a variety of purposes, consisting of vocalic nasalization, and the nasal consonants , , , ,  before another consonant. This leads to alternative Hindi spellings for the some words, e.g., the word Hindi itself has two spellings: &lt;U+0939&gt;&lt;U+093F&gt;&lt;U+0928&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;&lt;U+0926&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt; and &lt;U+0939&gt;&lt;U+093F&gt;&lt;U+0902&gt;&lt;U+0926&gt;&lt;U+0940&gt;.
&lt;U+0905&gt;&lt;U+0903&gt; (called visarga), pronounced as . Used only in Sanskrit loanwords (&lt;U+092A&gt;&lt;U+0903&gt;).
The diacritic &lt;U+0905&gt;&lt;U+0901&gt; (called candrabindu), not listed in the alphabet, is used interchangeably with the anusv&lt;U+0101&gt;ra to indicate nasalization of the vowel (&lt;U+092A&gt;&lt;U+0901&gt;).

If a lone consonant needs to be written without any following vowel, it is given a halanta/vir&lt;U+0101&gt;ma diacritic below (&lt;U+092A&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;).
There is less lip-rounding than in English in the long open-mid back rounded vowel (: as au in caught). The vowel  in Hindi is more central and less back than in English, like .
All vowels in Hindi, short or long, can be nasalized, except &lt;U+0911&gt;. Barring exceptions, the nasalization is phonemic.
In Sanskrit and in some (eastern) dialects of Hindi (as well as in a few words in Standard Hindi), the vowel &lt;U+0910&gt; is pronounced as a diphthong  or  rather than . Similarly, the vowel &lt;U+0914&gt; is pronounced in some words as the diphthong  or  rather than . Other than these, Hindi does not have true diphthongs&lt;U+2014&gt;two vowels might occur sequentially but then they are pronounced as two syllables (a glide might come in between while speaking).
The vowel &lt;U+0910&gt; is used to represent the English vowel /&lt;U+00E6&gt;/ in words like &quot;cat&quot; /k&lt;U+00E6&gt;t/; in these cases, many Hindi speakers pronounce it as [&lt;U+00E6&gt;&lt;U+02D0&gt;] instead of , adding an additional vowel phoneme to the Hindi inventory.
In the Devanagari script used for Sanskrit, whenever a consonant in a word-ending position is without a vir&lt;U+0101&gt;ma (ie, freely standing in the orthography: &lt;U+092A&gt; as opposed to &lt;U+092A&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;), the short neutral vowel schwa () is automatically associated with it&lt;U+2014&gt;this is of course true for the consonant when in any other position in the word. However, in Hindi, even if the word-ending consonant is written without a vir&lt;U+0101&gt;ma, the associated schwa is almost never pronounced. The schwa () may be pronounced very short only if the absence of schwa would otherwise make the pronunciation of the word very difficult &lt;U+2014&gt; such a situation arises when there is a consonantal cluster at the end of the word. Thus, for phonological purposes, a word-ending grapheme without a halant or any other vowel-diacritic must be treated as consonant ending. The schwa in Hindi is usually dropped (syncopated) in khariboli even at certain instances in word-middle positions, where the orthography would otherwise dictate so. e.g., &lt;U+0930&gt;&lt;U+0941&gt;&lt;U+0915&gt;&lt;U+0928&gt;&lt;U+093E&gt; (to stay) is normally pronounced as , while according to the orthography, it should have been . (Tiwari, [1966] 2004). Schwa is never syncopated in the first syllable, but often syncoped in the second or the penultimate syllable &lt;U+2014&gt; this of course reduces the number of syllables in the word. The syncopation of schwa is not phonemically contrastive.

The dropping of schwa at the end in Hindi (for Sanskrit loanwords) causes a big problem for foreigners (Westerners learning Hindi). The IAST a appended to the end of these words rather confuses the foreigners to pronounce it as  or &lt;U+2014&gt;this makes the masculine Sanskrit/Hindi words sound feminine. Some examples are given below:

Consonants
Hindi has a large consonant system, with about 38 distinct consonant phonemes. An exact number cannot be given, since the regional varieties of Hindi differ in the details of their consonant repertoire. To what extent certain sounds that appear only in foreign words should be considered part of Standard Hindi is also a matter of debate. The traditional core of the consonant system, inherited from Sanskrit, consists of a matrix of 20 plosives, 5 nasals, and 8 sonorants and fricatives. The system is filled out by 5 sounds that originated in Persian, but are now considered Hindi sounds. The table below shows the phonology of the Hindi consonants. Note that all nasals, trills, flaps, approximants and lateral approximants in Hindi are regarded as voiced consonants, and that many linguists also call the aspirated voiced plosives as breathy voice or murmur stops.

The 25 stop consonants occur in five groups, with each group sharing the same position of articulation. These positions in their traditional order are: velar, retroflex, palatal, dental, and bilabial. In each position, there are five varieties of consonant, with four oral stops and one nasal stop. An oral stop may be voiced, aspirated, both, or neither. This four-way opposition is the hardest aspect of Hindi pronunciation for a speaker of English. The table below shows the traditional listing of the Hindi consonants (in the Devanagari script) with the (nearest) equivalents in English/Spanish. Each consonant shown below is deemed to be followed by the neutral vowel schwa (), and is named in the table as such. The Roman script equivalent that is normally used to transcribe Hindi in casual transliteration is also given in the second line.

At the end of the traditional table of alphabets, three consonantal clusters are also added: &lt;U+0915&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;&lt;U+0937&gt;  (in Hindi), &lt;U+0924&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;&lt;U+0930&gt;  and &lt;U+091C&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;&lt;U+091E&gt;  (pronunciation given for Hindi). Other than these, sounds borrowed from the other languages like Persian and Arabic are written with a dot (bindu or nukta) beneath the nearest approximate alphabet. They are not included in the traditional listing. Many native Hindi speakers do not pronounce these sounds (except ) and replace them instead with the nearest equivalents, as shown in column 4 in the table below. These are:

&lt;U+0921&gt;&lt;U+093C&gt;  and &lt;U+0922&gt;&lt;U+093C&gt;  are not of Persian/Arabic origin, but they are allophonic variants of simple voiced retroflex stops of Sanskrit.
Additional notes on the consonants
Some additional features of Hindi consonant system are given here, as well as some useful tips to those whose native language is English but are interested in learning Hindi language.

The distinction between the aspirated and the unaspirated consonants is really very strong, not only in Hindi, but also in Sanskrit and many other languages of India.
The distinction between the dental plosives and the retroflex plosives is also very stark in all Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages.
Aspiration is actually a puff of breath that may follow a plosive consonant. English speakers should try to pronounce the voiceless aspirates by speaking these words in a quick but clear liaison-like fashion:

&quot;take him&quot;, &quot;get him&quot;, &quot;ditch him&quot;, &quot;slap him&quot;.
One could also try speaking the words &quot;kite&quot;, &quot;take&quot;, &quot;chip&quot; and &quot;pat&quot; with a greater-than-usual puff of breath after the first consonant. The corrsponding unaspirated plosives must be pronounced with no significant puff of breath at all.

No nasal consonant except  and  can start a word in Hindi. All the other nasal consonants in modern Hindi are conditioned allophones of .
Tiwari ([1966] 2004) lists the following additional phonemes in Hindi: the aspirates ,  and . They are phonemically contrastive to the corresponding unaspirated consonants, but orthographically appear as consonant clusters &lt;U+0928&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;&lt;U+0939&gt;, &lt;U+092E&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;&lt;U+0939&gt;, &lt;U+0932&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;&lt;U+0939&gt;.
The retroflex flaps cannot start a word. They did not exist as such in Sanskrit&lt;U+2014&gt;they have sprung up as the allophonic flap variants of Sanskrit's simple voiced retroflex plosives. The other Indo-Aryan languages and Dravidian languages tend to use retroflex flaps in their vocabulary even more frequently than Hindi does. Originally, they were purely conditioned allophones in Hindi, coming if and only if the consonants  and  came in word-middle positions when surrounded by two vowels or word-ending positions when preceded by a vowel, and never in the word-beginning position or in consonantal clusters (where the plosives would come). But the inclusion of English words, whose alveolar plosives become retroflex in Hindi, have made at least the unaspirated retroflex flap  a separate phoneme. The grapheme &lt;U+0923&gt; , when followed by a vowel, is usually flapped.
Hindi  are (apico-) dental as in Spanish or Italian.
The retroflex consonants are the most difficult to pronounce. They are pronounced by curling the tongue such that its tip touches the roof of the mouth, like how the Americans pronounce their &quot;r&quot;. Much though has been listed that Hindi (being an Indo-Aryan language) has retroflex plosives, certain linguists (who are also the native speakers of Hindi) disagree. According to Tiwari ([1966] 2004), the so-called retroflex plosives in Hindi are at the most (apico-) post-alveolar or pre-palatal, and sometimes even alveolar. The retroflex flaps are pronounced in a similar way, by bringing the tongue's tip to the roof of the mouth or pre-palatal region and giving it a sharp flap downwards. Hence, the so-called retroflex plosives are not phonemically contrastive with the alveolar stops that come through English loanwords, but rather with the dental plosives.
Sanskrit  is retroflex, but Hindi  is the alveolar trill, as in Scottish English.
The palatal affricates of Hindi do not have as much a sharp frictional release as in English. They have more of a plosive component. It is not very clear whether they are clearly palatal or postalveolar (as in English). Tiwari ([1966] 2004) classifies them as palatal, and certainly as affricates and not pure plosives, that Sanskrit used to have. He has also called the sibilant &lt;U+0936&gt; as a voiceless palatal fricative , rather than postalveolar. However, Hock (1991) prefers to say that this particular sibilant is phonetically the same, whether articulated from the postalveolar region or from the palatal region.
Hindi has neither  nor . Its nearest equivalent is , which is very close to , but does not have a friction or buzzing sound associated with it. Tiwari ([1966] 2004) claims that /w/ is its allophone.
The voiceless retroflex fricative  of Sanskrit has been replaced by  in modern Hindi pronunciation, but is used in spellings as such.
It is doubtful whether Hindi has a voiced glottal fricative  (for the alphabet &lt;U+0939&gt;) or its unvoiced counterpart. The difference between them, unlike in Sanskrit, is not phonemically contrastive.
The five new consonants borrowed from Perso-Arabic, /q/, /x/, , /z/ and /f/, are only peripheral phonemes in Hindi. Most native Hindi-speakers cannot produce them, and substitute /k/, , /g/,  and  respectively for these consonants. Because the phonemes /z/ and /f/ come in English loanwords, people of the new generation well-educated in English usually pronounce them correctly, but still use substitutes for the other three. In the Urdu style, all five are pronounced correctly.

Supra-segmental features
Hindi has a stress accent, but it is not so important as in English. Usually in a multisyllabic Hindi word, the stress falls on the last syllable if all the syllables are equally heavy or equally light. (A light syllable is closed by a short vowel a, i, u, while a medium syllable is closed by a long vowel or diphthong &lt;U+0101&gt;, e, &lt;U+012B&gt;, o, &lt;U+016B&gt;, au, ai or by two consonants, and a heavy syllable is closed by both a long vowel/diphthong and two consonants.) If the word contains a mixture or heavy and light syllables, the stress falls automatically on the penultimate heaviest syllable. (Cf. McGregor, pp. xx-xxi.) Strictly speaking, Hindi, like most other Indian languages, is rather a syllable timed language. The schwa  has a strong tendency to vanish into nothing (syncopated) if its syllable is unaccented. Also note that in written Hindi, many words end in short /u/ or short /i/, but in speech they are often converted to ending in long  or long , respectively. The intonation of speaking is very important in Hindi (although Hindi is not a tonal language like Chinese) to express the sentiments of respect, politeness, question, etc.
Writing system

Hindi is written in the standardized Devanagari script, which is written from left to right. The Devanagari script represents the sounds of spoken Hindi very closely, so that a person who knows the Devanagari letters can sound out a written Hindi text comprehensibly, even without knowing what the words mean or having heard them before. The entire alphabet has been discussed in the preceding section on phonology.
Transliteration Conventions
The standard transliteration of Hindi into the Roman alphabet is usually the IAST scheme, whereby the retroflex consonants (retroflex t, d, their aspirates, n, vowel-like r) and the breath h are shown with a dot beneath; the long vowels are shown with a macron or a bar (as  above; aspiration of a plosive is shown with a following h; and elided a's are removed for a truer correspondence to speech. Other alphabet characters are pronounced as in normal English. Another transliteration (ITRANS) uses capital letters of English to transcribe the long vowels and retroflex consonants. However, since English is a lingua franca of the educated Indians, and since computer keyboards do not have features for typing the IAST characters, Indians today use a casual transliteration into English for Hindi words; in such a casual transliteration, used especially in online chatting, the retroflex and dental consonants are not differentiated, and neither the short and the long vowels (except that sometimes people double the alphabet to indicate a long vowel).

Common difficulties faced in learning Hindi

the phonetic mechanism of some sounds peculiar to Hindi (eg. rda, dha etc) The distinction between aspirated and unaspirated consonants will be difficult for English speakers. In addition, the distinction between dental and alveoloar (or retroflex) consonants will also pose problems. English speakers will find that they need to carefully distinguish between four different d-sounds and four different t-sounds.
pronunciation of vowels: In English, unstressed vowels tend to have a &quot;schwa&quot; quality. The pronunciation of such vowels in English is changed to an &quot;uh&quot; sound; this is called reducing a vowel sound. The second syllable of &quot;unify&quot; is pronounced , not &quot;ee.&quot; The same for the unstressed second syllable of &quot;person&quot; which is also pronounced  rather than &quot;oh.&quot; In Hindi, English-speakers must constantly be careful not to reduce these vowels.

In this respect, probably the most important mistake would be for English speakers to reduce final &quot;ah&quot; sounds to &quot;uh.&quot; This can be especially important because an English pronunciation will lead to misunderstandings about grammar and gender. In Hindi, &quot;vo bolta hai&quot; is &quot;he talks&quot; whereas &quot;vo bolti hai&quot; is &quot;she talks.&quot; A typical English pronunciation in the first sentence would be &quot;vo boltuh hai,&quot; which will be understood as &quot;she talks&quot; by most Hindi-native speakers.

The 'a' ending of many Sanskrit and Sanskrit borrowed masculine-gender words, due to Romanization, is highly confused by non-native speakers, because the short 'a' is dropped in Hindi. There are exceptions, of course, if the devanagari script itself dictates the additional diacritical mark for the vowel &quot;long &lt;U+0101&gt;&quot; at the end of certain masculine words, like Brahm&lt;U+0101&gt; (&lt;U+092C&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;&lt;U+0930&gt;&lt;U+0939&gt;&lt;U+094D&gt;&lt;U+092E&gt;&lt;U+093E&gt;).
the Verbal concordance; Hindi exhibits split ergativity; see Ergative-absolutive language for an example.
Relative-correlative constructions. In English interrogative and relative pronouns are the same word. In &quot;Who are you?&quot; the word &quot;who&quot; is an interrogative, or question, pronoun. In &quot;My friend who lives in Sydney can speak Hindi,&quot; the word &quot;who&quot; is not an interrogative, or question-pronoun. It is a relative, or linking-pronoun. In Hindi, there are different words for each. The interrogative pronoun tends to start with the &quot;k&quot; sound:&quot; kab = when?, kahaaN = where?, kitna = how much? The relative pronouns are usually very similar but start with &quot;j&quot; sounds: jab = when, jahaaN = where, jitna = how much.

Entertainment and showbusiness

 Hindi films play an important role in popular culture. The dialogues and songs of Hindi films use Khariboli and Hindi-Urdu in general, but the intermittent use of various dialects such as Awadhi, Rajasthani, Bhojpuri, Punjabi and quite often Bambaiya Hindi, as also of many English words, is common.
Alam Ara (1931), which ushered in the era of &quot;talkie&quot; films in India, was a Hindi film. This film had seven songs in it. Music soon became an integral part of Hindi cinema. It is a very important part of popular culture and now comprises an entire genre of popular music. So popular is film music that songs filmed even 50-60 years ago are a staple of radio/TV and are generally very familiar to a layman. Most of these songs are written in  shaayari style.
Hindi movies and songs are popular in many parts of India, such as Punjab, Gujarat and Maharashtra, that do not speak Hindi as a native language. Indeed, the Hindi film industry is largely based at Mumbai (Bombay), in the Marathi-speaking state of Maharashtra. Hindi films are also popular abroad, especially in Pakistan, Afghanistan,Nepal,Bangladesh and Iran.
The role of radio and television in propagating Hindi beyond its native audience cannot be overstated. Television in India was controlled by the central government until the proliferation of satellite TV rendered regulation redundant. During the era of control, Hindi predominated on both radio and TV, enjoying more air-time than local languages. After the advent of satellite TV, several private channels emerged to compete with the government's official TV channel. Today, a large number of satellite channels provide viewers with much variety in entertainment. These include soap operas, detective serials, horror shows, dramas, cartoons, comedies, host shows for Hindi songs, Hindu mythology, Persio-Arabic mythology and documentaries.

Hinglish

&quot;Hinglish&quot; is the use of Hindi and English, combining both, in one sentence. This is more commonly seen in urban and semi-urban centers of population, but is slowly spreading its root into rural and remote areas via television and word of mouth, slowly achieving vernacular status. Many speakers do not realize that they are incorporating English words into Hindi sentences or Hindi words into English sentences.
This highly popular mixing of both the languages in most parts of northern and central India has grown from the fact that English is a popular language of choice amongst the urban youth who find themselves comfortable in its lexicon. It is already the medium for imparting education in many schools across the nation. The advent of cable television and its pervasive growth has seen the masses exposed to a wide variety of programming from across the world.
Another factor contributing to the spread of Hinglish is the popularity of Bollywood films.
Examples

&quot;Dad, time kya hua hai?&quot; (Dad, what is the time right now?).
&quot;I have hazaar things on my mind right now.&quot; (I have thousands of things on my mind right now.)
&quot;Mama, mujhe mall se jeans lenee hai.&quot; (Mama, I want to buy jeans from the mall).
