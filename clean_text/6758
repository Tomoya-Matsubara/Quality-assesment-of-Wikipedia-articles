refers to a residence of the Empress Dowager of Japan. Literally, &lt;U+014C&gt;miya means Large Palace, but it is also a courtesy title of the Empress Dowager. 1 Thus, the name &lt;U+014C&gt;miya Palace does not refer to any specific place, such as &lt;U+014C&gt;miya-ku, Saitama.
In the modern history, there are three palaces called &lt;U+014C&gt;miya Palace:

, or simply &lt;U+014C&gt;miya Palace, in Kyoto was built in 1867 as the residence of Empress Eish&lt;U+014D&gt;, the spouse of Emperor K&lt;U+014D&gt;mei. The palace is now used as a lodging for the imperial family and state guests.2
in Akasaka, Tokyo was the residence of Empress Teimei, the spouse of Emperor Taish&lt;U+014D&gt;. After her death at the palace in 1951, the site of the palace was converted to the Crown Prince's residence which is now used by Crown Prince Naruhito and his family.
in the K&lt;U+014D&gt;kyo in Tokyo was originally the residence of Emperor Showa and Empress K&lt;U+014D&gt;jun and was called Fukiage Palace. After the Emperor's death in 1989, the palace was renamed Fukiage &lt;U+014C&gt;miya Palace where the Empress Dowager lived until her death in 2000.3
