Professional wrestling career
Early career
After being trained by Mikey Whipwreck, Myers made his debut in 2004, using his real name. He wrestled for the New York Wrestling Connection (NYWC) promotion. By 2005 he began regularly teaming with Brett Matthews and the duo of Myers and Matthews went on to defeat the NYWC Tag Team Champions Dickie Rodz and Mason Raige by disqualification, for which titles do not change hands.3 At the next event on June 4 they won a rematch decisively to become Tag Team Champions.4 Later that month they were attacked by The Dead Presidents (Lo Lincoln and Boog Washington) to set up a feud where they eventually lost their titles against them in July.5 on August 27.6 On September 23 they were entered into a three way match with the champions but Team Tremendous (Dan Barry and Ken Scampi) ended up with the belts.7 After continuing to win matches they re-earned a match against Team Tremendous and won the titles for the second time on January 25, 2006. They held the titles until they faced the B.S. Xpress (Tony Burma &amp; Mike Spinelli), who defeated them for the gold on March 26.8

Developmental territories (2006&lt;U+2013&gt;2007)

On February 24, 2006, Brian Myers signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment.9 He was given the ring name Brian Majors and teamed up with his former tag team partner Bret Matthews, who was renamed Brett Majors, to form the tag team the Majors Brothers. Together they won the Deep South Wrestling DSW Tag Team Championship on two occasions. They later won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship.10
Teaming with Zack Ryder; La Familia (2007&lt;U+2013&gt;2009)
 The team was moved from the developmental league to the main roster, changing their last names from &quot;Majors&quot; to &quot;Major&quot;. The team worked on WWE's ECW brand. The team won their debut match, but failed to win any consecutive matches in either singles or tag team competition following their debut on the brand.111213 They moved from ECW to SmackDown! on June 17, 2007, as the eighth pick in the 2007 Supplemental Draft.14 On SmackDown the team had only slightly more success than on the ECW brand, defeating the team of Chavo Guerrero and Jamie Noble.15 On November 9, 2007, they received a tag title match after winning a number one contender's battle royal, but could not defeat the champions, Montel Vontavious Porter and Matt Hardy.16
At Armageddon, the duo dressed up like Edge and interfered in the World Heavyweight Championship match, replacing Edge at several points along the match to help him win the title and thus turning heel for the first time in their WWE career.17 On December 21, 2007, the Major Brothers were revealed as acquaintances to Edge and his lover, SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero. The Major Brothers were repackaged and renamed as Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder, with Brian Major becoming &quot;Curt Hawkins&quot; and Brett Major now &quot;Zack Ryder&quot;.18 Hawkins and Ryder were also, occasionally referred as &quot;The Rated-R Entourage&quot; by commentators Michael Cole and John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL). Occasionally, the pair teamed with their mentor Edge and/or their &quot;La Familia&quot; associate Chavo Guerrero on SmackDown on several occasions.
At The Great American Bash on July 20, 2008, Hawkins and Ryder won the WWE Tag Team Championship from John Morrison and The Miz in a fatal four-way match which also featured Jesse and Festus and Finlay and Hornswoggle after Hawkins pinned Jesse.1920 Their victory meant that they were the youngest tag team champions in WWE history.21 At SummerSlam, La Familia seemed to have ended when a returning Undertaker sent Edge to Hell and then refused to forgive Vickie &lt;U+2013&gt; prompting all the members to abandon Vickie, who would later align with Big Show. On the September 26, 2008 airing of SmackDown, Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder lost the titles to Carlito and Primo Col&lt;U+00F3&gt;n in their first televised title defense.22
On April 15, 2009, Ryder was drafted back to the ECW brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft, separating the team.23
Florida Championship Wrestling (2009&lt;U+2013&gt;2010)

Following the draft, Hawkins would spend months on hiatus from television before voluntarily leaving the main roster and going to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) for more training.24 He made his debut losing to Dawson Alexander.25 In the following weeks, Hawkins would go on to win an 8-man battle royal to become the number one contender for Justin Angel's FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship but subsequently lost the championship match.26 He would later join a stable called &quot;The Dude Busters&quot; alongside Caylen Croft and Trent Barreta on November 1, 2009.27 In late November, Hawkins and Croft won the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship.28 While they were champions, Croft and Hawkins would defend the title with Barreta via the Freebird Rule.29 On January 14, 2010 at an FCW television taping, The Dude Busters lost the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship to The Fortunate Sons (Brett DiBiase and Joe Hennig).30
The Gatecrashers (2010)

Hawkins returned to the SmackDown roster on May 4, 2010, forming a tag team with Vance Archer defeating Chasyn Rance and JT Talent in a dark match.31 They made their television debut as a team on the May 13 episode of WWE Superstars, defeating two local competitors. After the match, Hawkins stated that he and Archer had been given a 30-day contract to &quot;make an impact&quot;.32 The team made its SmackDown debut on the May 21 episode, winning another squash match.33 In an attempt to make an impact, the duo attacked Montel Vontavious Porter and Christian on consecutive episodes of SmackDown on June 4 and June 11, which they followed up on by defeating both in a tag team match on June 18.343536 The next week the duo was officially named &quot;The Gatecrashers&quot;. The pair also competed in a battle royal on the June 4 episode of SmackDown to replace The Undertaker in the World Heavyweight Championship fatal four-way match at Fatal 4-Way. Hawkins was one of the four final participants in the match, but was eliminated by the eventual winner, Rey Mysterio.37 After their 30-day contract expired, they were signed to new long-term contracts in storyline.38 The team came to an end on the October 7 airing of Superstars after a match between Archer and Chris Masters. Archer accidentally struck Hawkins outside the ring after which the two argued and a distracted Archer lost the match. Afterwards, Hawkins assaulted Archer.39 Hawkins moved to singles competition the following week, defeating Trent Barreta.40 A rivalry then began between the two shortly after, with Barreta getting the win on the November 18 episode of Superstars.41 In a rematch the next week, Hawkins defeated Barreta, claiming Barreta's win the week before was a fluke.42 The feud ended with Barreta coming out on top when Barreta beat Hawkins on the December 9 episode of Superstars.43
Teaming with Tyler Reks (2011-2012)

On April 26, Hawkins was drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2011 Supplemental Draft.44 Hawkins and Ryder had a brief reunion on the May 19 episode of Superstars, where they teamed together in a losing effort against Kozlov and Santino Marella. After Hawkins beat JTG on the May 26 episode of Superstars,45 Hawkins would not see action again until more than three months later, when he teamed with Tyler Reks to defeat Percy Watson and Titus O'Neil. On the September 27 episode of NXT Redemption, Curt Hawkins and Tyler Reks attacked the Usos, making a statement.46 On the October 5, 2011 episode of NXT Hawkins and Reks faced the Usos and were successful. From October, Hawkins, claiming a broken ankle, began to carry around a metal walking cane.47 However, when Hawkins' injury had healed sufficiently for him to wrestle, he still brought the cane with him to the ring.48 Hawkins and Reks would lose to The Usos once again on December 6. Reks and Hawkins would then lose a non-title match to the tag team champions Air Boom on the December 22 episode of Superstars. He had his first match on Raw on January 9, 2012, and was quickly defeated by a returning Brodus Clay.49 Hawkins and Reks would feud with the duo of Trent Barreta and Yoshi Tatsu from December 2011.50 Both teams would play pranks on each other, with Tatsu being locked in a closet and Reks' hands being superglued onto an Xbox controller.51 Hawkins and Reks would beat Barreta and Tatsu on the January 18, 2012 episode of NXT.52  Hawkins and Reks would then settle into the role of NXT's troublemakers, tormenting NXT host Matt Striker on his lacklustre career and how they should be main-eventing NXT, even once going to the extent of assaulting him after a match.53 This forced Striker to appoint William Regal as NXT's prime authority figure on the February 29 episode of NXT.54 Regal would employ harsh measures to keep Hawkins and Reks in line, including threatening suspensions for bad behaviour and condemning them to janitorial duty, this caused them much frustration.55 On the March 21 episode of NXT Redemption, Striker was knocked out with chloroform by Johnny Curtis and Maxine, and then Striker was kidnapped (kayfabe) by unknown persons,56 later revealed to be Hawkins and Reks, who intended to blackmail Maxine into using her charms to get Regal to leave them alone.57 Unfortunately for Hawkins and Reks, Striker was rescued by Derrick Bateman and Kaitlyn.58 On the April 18 episode of NXT, the freed Striker confronted Hawkins and Reks about the kidnapping, and Hawkins admitted the crime. As punishment, Regal put Hawkins and Reks in a match against each other with Striker as referee and the loser of the match would be fired. Even though Reks won to supposedly save his job at the expense of Hawkins', Regal decided to fire Reks as well, sending the two troublemakers away from NXT.59
However, Regal could not keep the duo away from NXT for long, as they managed to convince villainous higher authority figure John Laurinaitis to rehire them as NXT's security team on the May 9 episode of NXT.60 Hawkins and Reks would then continue to play the role of Laurinaitis' lackeys, confiscating anti-Laurinaitis signs at Over the Limit61 and attacking John Cena on the May 21 episode of Raw.62 Hawkins and Reks' association with Laurinaitis ended after Laurinaitis lost his job at No Way Out.63 On the final episode of the fifth season of NXT on June 13, Hawkins and Reks defeated Percy Watson and Derrick Bateman.
Hawkins and Reks would then engage in a one-sided feud with Ryback in July 2012. After both Hawkins and Reks lost singles matches to Ryback on SmackDown, Ryback defeated both of them in a handicap match at Money in the Bank.64 At Raw 1,000, Hawkins and Reks, along with four other wrestlers, attempted to ambush Kane to make a statement, but a returning Undertaker interrupted the attack and the Brothers of Destruction disposed of Hawkins and Reks.65 The duo would once again lose to Ryback on the August 6 episode of Raw.66 After being told by SmackDown General Manager Booker T to &quot;step it up&quot;,67 Hawkins and Reks debuted a stripper gimmick on the August 17 episode of SmackDown while squashing a jobber tag team.68
Singles competition (2012&lt;U+2013&gt;present)
A week later, Reks asked for his release as he intended to retire from wrestling to spend more time with his family; he and WWE parted ways on August 21, thus ending the team.6970 On the September 1 edition of WWE Saturday Morning Slam, Hawkins returned to singles competition, in a losing effort against Brodus Clay.
In other media
Hawkins is a playable character in WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2009.
Hawkins first venture into YouTube came in the form of a short lived YouTube series called Callin' Spots with Curt Hawkins, which only lasted only two episode as of April 2011.71 His first video has since been deleted but has kept up his second video where he thanks Edge for giving him his first opportunity in WWE which was being part of La Familia and for being a friend and mentor.
Hawkins also started appearing in Zack Ryder's YouTube series, Z! True Long Island Story.72 After sporadically appearing on the show he has now become a regular on the show. Hawkins and Reks have appeared on the show together also. One of Hawkins more memorable segments came after Zack Ryder started to use a cane on his show Scott Stanford, another regular on the show, has came up to Hawkins and Reks saying that they are using the Broski Cane, this has annoyed the pair on every occasion stating that Hawkins used a cane first.
Hawkins and Reks created an animated YouTube series called MidCard Mafia in 2011, but the show upset WWE management, so Hawkins and Reks cancelled the series and removed the uploaded shows.73
With WWE revitalising their YouTube channel they have created a number of new series that have WWE Superstars and Divas appearing in them. Hawkins has appeared in multiple episodes of WWE Inbox, a show where Superstars and Divas answer questions submitted by fans on Twitter. On episode five of Santino Marella's &quot;Foreign Exchange&quot; Marella and Yoshi Tatsu gave him their spare change after seeing him wearing his &quot;Change for NXT&quot; shirt.
