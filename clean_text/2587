Since the two motorways are operated by Autocesta RijekaZagreb and Hrvatske autoceste, the toll collection system is operated jointly the two operators. The toll is payable in Croatian kuna, euro, major credit and debit cards and using a number of prepaid toll collection systems including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operators and ENC - an Electronic toll collection electronic toll collection ETC which is shared at all motorways in Croatia except the A2 Croatia A2 motorway and provides drivers use of dedicated lanes at toll plazas and a discounted toll rates.cite web   publisher = HUKA   language = Croatian   url = http://www.huka.hr/Cestarine/ENC/   title= Statistiki podaci   trans_title = Electronic toll collection available on HAC, ARZ and BINA Istra motorways   accessdate = August 28, 2010

There are plans for the outer Zagreb bypass integrated into the tolled motorway network&nbsp;&mdash; as the ultimate solution for congestion at the Luko toll plaza. That will require construction of a Horvati interchange south of the Luko toll plaza.

History
File:vor Luko iz zraka.jpg thumb right 250px alt=An aerial view of Luko interchange Luko interchange
The A1 motorway was originally designed in early 1970s, albeit along a different route than the present ZagrebSplit motorway route. After suppression of the Croatian Spring and removal of the Croatian leadership that proposed and adopted the construction plan in 1971, all the work related to the ZagrebSplit motorway was cancelled. The plans were revived in the 1990s and new designs were developed to include a motorway section built between Zagreb and Karlovac into the design so that the section could be shared between ZagrebSplit and ZagrebRijeka motorways. Construction work started in 2000 and the motorway reached Split by 2005 and was extended towards Dubrovnik later on. Both in the 1970s and in 2000s, construction of the ZagrebSplit motorway was perceived to symbolize rebuilding of national unity.

The ZagrebSplit motorway, now the A1 motorway, was one of three routes defined by the Parliament of the Socialist Republic of Croatia on March 5, 1971, as priority transport routes of Croatia that were to be developed as motorways. Originally the motorway was designed to follow a route from Zagreb to Biha Bosnia and Herzegovina and then to Split via Knin. The government of Bosnia and Herzegovina issued its approval for the route in Biha region in the same year. Construction of the motorway was initiated by a fundraising effort&nbsp; a public loan. The funds gathered initially through the public loan were sufficient for construction of convert 20 km abbr=off of the motorway.

The convert 39.3 km adj=on long ZagrebKarlovac section of the ZagrebRijeka motorway, now part of the A1 motorway, was completed in 1972. Further construction of motorways from Zagreb to Rijeka and Split was suspended for the next 28 years following a political decision of the Croatian leadership, newly installed during Yugoslav suppression of the Croatian Spring, to stop megalomaniac projects. It is considered that the true reason for the cancellation of the works was that the motorway was considered to be a nationalist project. The conclusion is supported by the fact the road was spontaneously nicknamed King Tomislav Motorway lang-hr Autocesta kralja Tomislava by citizens investing their money through the public loan after the first king of Kingdom of Croatia medieval medieval Croatia, who united Croatia as a single kingdom in 925. The funds raised through the public loan were left unused for several months, then spent for construction of a road between Vrlika and Strmica, Croatia Strmica via Knin, currently a part of the D1 and D30 Croatia D30 state roads. However, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe recognized the route as the southernmost part of the Pyhrn Autobahn Pyhrn route, giving it the designation E59 in 1975.cite web   publisher= United Nations Economic Commission for Europe   url=http://www.unece.org/trans/conventn/ECE-TRANS-SC1-384e.pdf   title=European Agreement on Main International Traffic Arteries   date=March 13, 2008   format=PDF   accessdate=September 6, 2010

In the beginning of the 1990s, construction of the motorway was further postponed because of onset of the Croatian War of Independence. The decade saw renewed discussion regarding construction of the motorway, including renewed considerations of its route. Soon, the originally devised route running through Biha was set aside and two new routes were considered: One of them was a modified version of the original route, bypassing Biha and running through the Plitvice Lakes region while the other was a completely new route further to the west via Gospi and Zadar, which was eventually accepted for construction. Both of the alternative routes proposed that the ZagrebKarlovac motorway already completed in 1972 were to be used as the northernmost section of the ZagrebSplit and ZagrebRijeka motorways.cite news   newspaper = Graevinar   language = Croatian   url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/20041   title= Prikaz studije opravdanosti brze ceste Dubrovnik&nbsp;Zagreb   trans_title = Review of Zagreb&nbsp; Dubrovnik expressway feasibility study   author=Jaka Milii   date = August 31, 2000   accessdate = September 6, 2010ukan cite news   newspaper = Graevinar   language = Croatian   url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/20039   title= Osvrt na Studiju opravdanosti brze ceste Dubrovnik&nbsp; Zagreb   trans_title = A review of the Zagreb&nbsp; Dubrovnik expressway feasibility study   author=Petar ukan   date = September 28, 2000   accessdate = September 6, 2010cite news   newspaper = Slobodna Dalmacija   language = Croatian   url = http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20000518/novosti3.htm   title= Ugovor s Bechtelom je konaan: brza cesta definitivno otpada!   trans_title = Bechtel contract final: Expressway definitely cancelled   author=S.

Construction cost

The construction cost for the Bosiljevo&nbsp;2&ndash;Split Dugopolje interchange sector of the motorway was originally estimated by the government in 2001 and presented as 3 x 3 x 3 - that is, the convert 300 km abbr=off of the motorway was to be completed in 3 years at a cost of 3 billion German mark marks approximately 12.65 billion kuna at the time, or approximately 1.533 billion euros.cite web   publisher = Croatian Radiotelevision   language = Croatian   url = http://www.hrt.hr/arhiv/2003/05/11/HRT0018.html   title= Izgradnja autoceste Zagreb&nbsp; Split prema planu   trans_title = Zagreb&nbsp; Split motorway construction proceeds as planned   date = May 11, 2003   accessdate = September 6, 2010 In 2010, Hrvatske autoceste reported that the average cost of one kilometer of BosiljevoSplit motorway was 7.1 million euro, which would mean that the total construction cost was 2.21 billion euro for that convert 311.4 km abbr=off long segment.

Construction cost incurred on the DugopoljePloe sector of the motorway between 2005 and 2008 was reported at 4.1 billion kuna and additional 1.8 billion kuna of construction expenses are planned until the end of 2012 representing approximately 560 and 245 million euro, respectively. The latter figure includes construction of the D425 Croatia D425 state road but it does not include full completion of the VrgoracPloe section.

 Traffic volume 
Image:Croatia A1 trafficvolume.gif right thumb alt=Bar graph of 2009 A1 traffic volume counting data. Traffic volume measured on the A1 motorway 2009Traffic is regularly counted by means of traffic census at toll stations and reported by Autocesta Rijeka&ndash;Zagreb and Hrvatske autoceste&mdash;the operators of the northern and the southern portions of the motorway respectively. The reported traffic volume gradually decreases as the motorway chainage increases and as it passes by various major destinations and the interchanges that serve them. Thus the greatest volume of traffic is registered between Jastrebarsko and Luko interchanges - with 31,432 vehicle Annual average daily traffic annual average daily traffic AADT, and 53,216 vehicle Annual average daily traffic#Average summer daily traffic average summer daily traffic ASDT figures as that is the section closest to Zagreb. South of the Bosiljevo&nbsp;2 interchange the first major drop of traffic volume is recorded on the A1 motorway, due to traffic transferring to the A6 motorway towards Rijeka. Other similar changes of the traffic volume are registered near Zadar served by Zadar&nbsp;1 and Zadar&nbsp;2 interchanges and Split served by Dugopolje interchange. Substantial variations observed between AADT and ASDT are normally attributed to the fact that the motorway carries significant tourist traffic. The seasonal increase traffic volume variations ranges 69% on the busiest, Luko&ndash;Jastrebarsko section to 160% as measured on Sveti Rok&ndash;Maslenica section. The summer season traffic volume increase on the motorway is 120%.cite web   publisher = Hrvatske ceste   url = http://www.hrvatske-ceste.hr/WEB%20-%20Legislativa/brojenje-prometa/CroDig2009.pdf   title = Traffic counting on the roadways of Croatia in 2009 - digest   date = May 1, 2010   format=PDF   accessdate = September 6, 2010

 Rest areas

As of September 2010, there are 26 rest areas operating along the A1 motorway, and additional rest areas are planned along the existing sections of the route and those sections currently under construction. Legislation provides for four types of rest areas designated as types A through D&mdash;A-type rest areas comprise a full range of amenities including a filling station, a restaurant and a hotel or a motel; B-type rest areas have no lodging; C-type rest areas are very common and include a filling station and a caf, but no restaurants or accomodations; D-type rest areas offer parking spaces only, possibly some picnicking tables and benches and restrooms.cite web   publisher = Hrvatske autoceste   url = http://www.hac.hr/index.php?task=odm&stask=1   title= Basic types and offer of roadside service facilities   accessdate = September 26, 2010 Even though the rest areas found along the A1 motorway generally follow this ranking system, there are considerable variations as some of them offer extra services. The most notable example is Krka rest area&mdash;even though it has no filling station, there is, for instance, a restaurant available. The filling stations regularly have small convenience stores and some of them offer Liquefied petroleum gas LPG fuel. EuroTest, an international association of 18 European automobile clubs spearheaded by German automobile club ADAC, surveyed three of the A1 motorway rest areas in 2009: Krka, Liki Osik and Modru in case of the latter, both eastbound and westbound. All of the rest areas were rated as very good, especially in terms of facilities offered.cite web   publisher = EuroTest   url = http://www.eurotestmobility.com/eurotest.php?itemno=325&lang=EN   title= EuroTests - EuroTest 2009 - Motorway Rest Areas   accessdate = September 26, 2010cite news   newspaper = Slobodna Dalmacija   url = http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/%C5%A0ibenik/tabid/74/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/71231/Default.aspx   language= Croatian   author= Ivica Marasovi   title= Priznanje odmoritu Krka, ocjena izvrstan   trans_title= An award for Krka rest area, rated excellent   date= September 22, 2009   accessdate = September 26, 2010

The primary motorway operators Hrvatske autoceste HAC and Autocesta Rijeka&nbsp;&ndash; Zagreb lease the A, B and C type rest areas to various operators through public tenders. As of September 2010, there are five such rest area operators on the A1 motorway: INA company INA, OMV, Tifon, Petrol d.d. Petrol and Crobenz. The rest area operators are not permitted to sub-lease the fuel operations; Tifon and Petrol operated rest areas have restaurants or hotels operated by March Mvenpick March, a Mvenpick Hotels & Resorts subsidiary. All of the A1 motorway rest areas, except Stupnik and Jezerane, are accessible to both directions of the motorway traffic. The rest areas normally operate operate 24&nbsp;hours a day, 7&nbsp;days a week.
