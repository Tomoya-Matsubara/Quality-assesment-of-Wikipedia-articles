Matthew James Bellamy (born 9 June 1978) is an English musician and composer, who is best known as the lead vocalist, guitarist, pianist, and primary songwriter of the rock band Muse.
Early life
Bellamy's father, George, was the rhythm guitarist in the 1960s rock group The Tornados, who were the first British band to have a United States number one song, with &quot;Telstar&quot;.1 &quot;Knights of Cydonia&quot;, a single from Muse's fourth album Black Holes &amp; Revelations, is often cited as a tribute to that song, with its space rock sound and accompanying video depicting a cowboy's quest through an alien landscape. Bellamy's mother, Marilyn, was born in Belfast, and moved to England in the 1970s. On her first day in England she met George, who was at the time working as a taxi driver in London. They moved to Cambridge, where Matthew's older brother Paul was born, followed a couple of years later by Matthew himself. Bellamy started playing the piano at age 6.
In the mid-1980s the family moved to Teignmouth, Devon. After the divorce of Bellamy's parents he moved in with his grandmother, who pushed him towards learning to play the guitar at the age of fourteen.
Muse

Muse formed in Teignmouth, Devon in 1994 under the name of Rocket Baby Dolls. Still using the name Rocket Baby Dolls they won the school's battle of the bands which led them to take the band seriously, and decided to change their name to a more &quot;professional&quot; name, Muse. The band is composed of Matthew Bellamy, Christopher Wolstenholme (bass guitar and backing vocals) and Dominic Howard (drums and percussion). Muse met at Teignmouth Community College where Bellamy had been in a number of bands previously including Carnage Mayhem and Gothic Plague with drummer Dominic Howard. When members of Gothic Plague left due to other interests, Bellamy and Howard asked Wolstenholme to join. Muse struggled to establish themselves during their early years but have since gone on to enjoy worldwide commercial success.
Muse blend alternative, hard rock, progressive rock, classical music and electronica and are well known for their energetic and visually dazzling live performances.2 On 16–17 June 2007 became the first band to sell out the newly built Wembley Stadium in London.3 Muse has released five studio albums, Showbiz (1999), Origin of Symmetry (2001), Absolution (2003), Black Holes &amp; Revelations (2006) and The Resistance (2009). Muse have also released one live album, HAARP (2008) and one compilation album Hullabaloo (2002). The first disc contains a collection of B-sides recorded between March 1999 and October 2001. The second disc features 11 live songs recorded on 28–29 October 2001 at 'le Zenith' in Paris. Bellamy also makes an appearance as a playable character in Guitar Hero 5 which features the playable song Plug In Baby.4

Musical equipment
Bellamy uses custom guitars designed by himself and Hugh Manson made in Exeter, Devon. He currently has a number of Manson guitars, as well as instruments by other manufacturers including a Fender 'Aloha' Stratocaster, a Gibson Les Paul DC Lite, a Gibson SG, Jackson Randy Rhoads (custom), a Parker Fly, a Peavey EVH Wolfgang, a Jay Turser JT-res Resonator and finally a Yamaha Pacifica. Bellamy's famous Manson shape has been compared to a Yamaha Pacifica, a Fender Telecaster, a Schecter and a Godin Triumph. Bellamy stated that he loved the classic guitar that Jimi Hendrix used.
The first and most famous is his silver Manson (Named Delorean). Bellamy came up with the basic concept for this guitar and Hugh Manson helped him realize it. It has a built-in Z.Vex Fuzz Factory which gives Bellamy his distinctive sound and the ability to manipulate the pedals oscillation sounds without bending down. In addition, it has an MXR Phase 90 phaser, a Roland midi pickup and uses Bare Knuckle and Kent Armstrong pickups. All of his other Mansons follow this same basic design (apart from Bellamy's 7 string which was not originally built for him but for a local jazz guitarist) with some just having different pickups and finishes, as with his mirrored Manson. Bellamy's black Manson has a MIDI strip that controls a Digitech Whammy IV, when it is connected, a Z.Vex Wah Probe and a number of other built in effects.
For the 2006 album Black Holes and Revelations, he bought a new guitar, the &quot;Black Kaoss Manson&quot;. The guitar features two Bare Knuckle Humbuckers, a Fernandes Sustainer System on the neck and a touch pad which connects to a Korg Kaoss Pad. He also bought the M1D1, which is similar to the Black Kaoss Manson but has a Bare Knuckle Nail Bomb humbucker in the bridge position and a Fernandes Sustainer System (FSK-101 model, which is the humbucker version of the latter one) on the neck. He is also known to use an Ibanez Destroyer on stage (Hullabaloo). Bellamy uses Diezel amp heads, along with Marshall Mode Four cabinets, Soldano Cabinets and Line 6 digital effects. In September 2009, Bellamy has mentioned the extensive use of Dickinson amplifiers on their album The Resistance.11 Most of Bellamy's rack effects are made with Line 6 modules. On 14 April 2009, Manson Guitars announced on their website that they had brought out a line of Matthew Bellamy signature guitars, based on the Seattle, Glitterati and Delorean models. They all have the option of MIDI touch pads.
