The song was first performed in Chicago and was recorded at the Chicago ending of Vedder's first solo tour.67
Origin and recording

Although Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder, who was raised in Evanston, Illinois and later ,8 is closely associated with grunge music,9 he has been a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan. He has performed the song &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch at several Cubs games and thrown out the ceremonial first pitch at Wrigley Field.10 His first seventh-innning stretch performance had been on Independence Day (July 4) 1998.11
Vedder has attended the Cubs fantasy camp for several years.12 While attending the camp one year, former Cubs shortstop and first baseman Ernie Banks requested that Vedder write a song about the Cubs.13 Vedder wrote &quot;All the Way&quot; the night before the camp started and first performed it at Pearl Jam's August 2, 2007 concert at The Vic Theater in Chicago with Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood and other Cubs players in attendance.1415 On August 3, 2007, one day after &quot;All the Way&quot; was premiered live, Vedder performed &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch at Wrigley Field for the fourth time and threw out the first pitch for the first time. Vedder's band, Pearl Jam, was in Chicago that week to perform at Lollapalooza,16 where the band was the headlining act for the three day festival that ended on August 5, 2007.17
The version of &quot;All the Way&quot; heard on the commercial single release was recorded during an August 22, 2008 solo performance by Vedder at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago.18 Vedder performed at the Auditorium Theatre on August 21 and August 22, 2008 on a three-week extension of his solo tour that began in  at the Boston Opera House and ended in Chicago.19 The solo tour had originally begun in  in Canada at The Centre on April 2, 2008.2021 This tour was Vedder's first solo tour.2223
Lyrics
The 3:39 song is in the folk music genre, and it is perceived as a sing-along sea chantey or drinking song.24 The lyrics to the song include lines such as &quot;Our heroes wear pinstripes/Pinstripes in blue/Give us a chance to feel like heroes, too.&quot;2526 The song makes references to Ernie Banks, Wrigley Field, and a specific reference to Banks' catch phrase of &quot;Let's play two!&quot;2728 The refrain includes the phrase &quot;Someday we'll go all the way, Yeah, someday we'll go all the way,&quot; which anticipates the day the Cubs win the World Series, gives the song its name.2930
Release and reception
On September 18, 2008, the song was made available for digital download via the Pearl Jam website for US$0.99.31 At the same time, the possibility of the production of future compact disc format and souvenir 45 single format versions was announced.32 The digital download has been released with an associated single cover art image that is a modified version of the Wrigley Field outfield wall.
Philip K. Wrigley had employee Bill Veeck, Jr. add ivy to the outfield walls of Wrigley Field in September 1937.3334 Wrigley Field is the home stadium for the Chicago Cubs, and its wall is well-known for being covered in ivy except for a few select places where signs are present as well as doors to locker rooms and such. The brick is visible under the ivy at the stadium in locations where the signs designate the distance from the wall to home plate measured in feet. The cover art image replaces the distance with the words &quot;All the Way&quot;. Through , the only signs on the outfield walls had been these signs designating the distance to homeplate. Then, on February 14, 2007, the Cubs announced that they would place advertisements for Under Armour on the outfield doors in left and right field.353637
By the time of the single release, local Chicago radio stations and sports bars had begun to play the song in anticipation of the 2008 Cubs' playoff run.38 The song is considered to be an earnest tribute to the Cubs.39 According to at least one source, the song is reminiscent of &quot;A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall&quot; by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan and much less upbeat than the song &quot;Go, Cubs, Go&quot; by American folk music singer-songwriter Steve Goodman.40 The Huffington Post encourages listeners to compare the song to Goodman's &quot;Go, Cubs, Go&quot;.41 Another source compares the song to American country-folk singer-songwriter John Prine's 1974 song &quot;Dear Abby&quot; in terms of melody and cadence as well as the theme of Goodman's &quot;A Dying Cubs Fan&lt;U+2019&gt;s Last Request&quot;.42
