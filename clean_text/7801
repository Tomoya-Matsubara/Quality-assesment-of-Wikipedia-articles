Strombidae, common name the true conchs, is a taxonomic family of medium-sized to very large sea snails with an operculum. These are marine gastropod mollusks in the clade Littorinimorpha.
The family Strombidae includes Strombus, Lambis, tibias, and their allies. Many more species existed in the geological past than are now extant.
The term true conchs, being a common name, does not have an exact meaning. It may refer generally to any of the Strombidae 1 but sometimes is used more specifically to include only Strombus and Lambis2 or just Strombus itself.3
Distribution
Thirty eight of the nearly 50 living species of Strombus occur in the Indo-Pacific region.4
Six species of strombids are found in the wider Caribbean region. Until recently, all of them were placed in the genus Strombus, but now many species are being moved into new genera.
Taxonomy
A cladogram based on sequences of nuclear histone H3 gene and mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) gene showing phylogenetic relationships of (32 analyzed) species in the genus Strombus and Lambis, including Atlantic and West / Indo Pacific species, was proposed by Latiolais et al (2006)5.



Morphology and life habits
Strombids have long eye stalks, a long and narrow aperture, and a siphonal canal. The shell margin has an indentation near the anterior end which accommodates one of the eye stalks. This indentation is called a strombid or stromboid notch. The stromboid notch may be more or less conspicuous depending on the species. The shell of most species in this family grow a flared lip upon reaching sexual maturity, and they lay eggs in long, gelatinous strands.
The genera Strombus and Lambis have many similarities between them, both anatomical and reproductive, though their shells show some conspicuous differences. They are known to be herbivores, and are usually associated with shallow water reefs and seagrass meadows.6
Leaping motion
Unlike most snails, which glide slowly across the substrate on their foot, strombids have a characteristic mean of locomotion, using their pointed, sickle-shaped, horny operculum to propel themselves forward in a so called leaping motion.7
Genera
Genera within the family Strombidae include:

Eustrombus Wentz, 1940 - a genus recently separated from Strombus
Lambis R&lt;U+00F6&gt;ding, 1798 - nine known living species
Strombus Linn&lt;U+00E9&gt;, 1758 - 55 known living species
Terebellum Linnaeus, 1758 - one known living species Terebellum terebellum (Linnaeus, 1767)
Tibia R&lt;U+00F6&gt;ding, 1798 - six known living species
Varicospira Eames, 1952 - three known living species
&lt;U+2020&gt; Rimella Agassiz, 1840

Extinct genera are marked with a dagger &lt;U+2020&gt;.
