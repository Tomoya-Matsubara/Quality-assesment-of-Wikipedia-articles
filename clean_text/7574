The five hundred euro (&lt;U+20AC&gt;500) note is the highest-value euro banknote and has been used since the introduction of the euro (in its cash form) in 2002. 1 It is one of the highest value banknotes in the world, worth around 670 USD , 4,300 CNY, 51,300 JPY, 600 CHF or 430 GBP. 2 The five hundred euro note is the largest at 160x82mm with a purple colour scheme. 3 All bank notes depict bridges and arches/doorways in a different historical European style; the five hundred euro note shows modern architecture (between the 20th and 21th century CE). 4 The euro is part of everyday life for over 320 million people. 5 The five hundred euro banknote is used in the 23 countries which have it as their sole currency (with 20 legally adopting it)6789101112 in Europe. 13 Over 175 million people use currencies pegged to the euro worldwide, with over 150 million people in Africa.
The changeover period during which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. 14 The earliest date was in Germany, where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months more. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued to be accepted by national central banks for periods ranging from several years to forever.15
History

The euro was set up on the 1st of January 1999, when it became the currency of over 300 million people in Europe. 16 For the first three years of its existence it was an invisible currency, only used in accountance. Euro cash was not introduced until 1 January 2002, when it replaced the banknotes and coins of the 12, as it was then, national currencies like the Irish Pound and the Austrian schilling. 17
Legally, both the European Central Bank and the central banks of the eurozone countries have the right to issue the 7 different euro banknotes. In practice, only the national central banks of the zone physically issue and withdraw euro banknotes. The European Central Bank does not have a cash office and is not involved in any cash operations. 18
Design
The five hundred euro note measures 160 &lt;U+00D7&gt; 82 mm and has a purple colour scheme. 19 All bank notes depict bridges and arches or doorways in different historical European styles; the five hundred euro note shows modern architecture (between the 20th and 21st century). 20 Although Robert Kalina's original designs were intended to show real monuments, in the case of the 500 euro note the Pont de Normandie in northern France, for political reasons the bridge and art are merely hypothetical examples of the architectural era.21
Like all euro notes, it contains the denomination, the EU flag, the signature of the president of the European Central Bank 22 (and the initials of said bank in different EU languages, a depiction of EU territories overseas, the stars from the EU flag and various security features as described below. 23
Security features
The five hundred euro note has the highest-quality security features of all notes due to its value. It is protected by a hologram stripe, reflective glossy stripe, a EURion constellation, watermarks, microprinting, ultraviolet ink, raised printing, a security thread, matted surface, perforations, see through number, colour changing ink, barcodes and a serial number. 24 The printer code is located in the 8 o'clock position star. 25
Changes
There has so far only been one series of euro notes, however a new series similar to the current one is to be issued from 2011.26 The initial issue of notes bears the signature of the first president of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, who was replaced on 1 November 2003 by Jean-Claude Trichet, whose signature appears on subsequent issues.27
Crime
 The value of the note is several times greater than that of the largest circulating notes of other major currencies, like the US$100 bill.28 Thus a large monetary value can be concentrated into a small volume of notes. This facilitates crimes which deal in cash, including money laundering, drug dealing and tax evasion.29 There have been calls to withdraw the note for this reason.3031 However, some of the replaced currencies had widely-used high-value notes, including 10,000 Belgian francs, 5000 Austrian schillings, 1000 Dutch guilders, and 1000 Deutsche Marks.32
Spain in particular now has a quarter of all these high-value bills within its borders. This is far more than expected for an economy of its size and they are rarely seen in every-day commerce &lt;U+2013&gt; they have been nicknamed &quot;bin Ladens&quot; by the populace (as everyone knows they are there and what they look like but they have never seen them).33 The UK and Spanish police are using the bills to track money laundering.3435
As of 20 April 2010, money exchange offices in the United Kingdom stopped selling &lt;U+20AC&gt;500 notes due to their use in money laundering. The Serious Organised Crime Agency claimed that &quot;90% of all &lt;U+20AC&gt;500 notes sold in the UK are in the hands of organised crime&quot;, revealed during an eight month analysis. The &lt;U+20AC&gt;500 note is worth in the region of &lt;U+00A3&gt;415 depending on exchange rates (more than eight times the value of the Bank of England's largest publicly-circulated note), and had become the currency choice for gangs to hide their profits.36
The EU directive 2005/06/EC37 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing tries to prevent such crime by requiring banks, real estate agents and many more companies to investigate and report usage of cash in excess of &lt;U+20AC&gt;15,000.
Circulation
Currently, there are approximately 584,187,400 &lt;U+20AC&gt;500 banknotes in circulation around the Eurozone 17, therefore it is the second-least circulated banknote in the Eurozone. (As of August 2011) 38 That is approximately &lt;U+20AC&gt;292,093,692,500 worth of &lt;U+20AC&gt;500 banknotes. (as of August 2011) 39 That is a decrease of 0.0004% from the previous month. 40 The ECB closely monitors the stock and circulation of euro banknotes and coins. It is the Eurosystem&lt;U+2019&gt;s task to ensure a smooth and efficient supply of euro banknotes and to maintain their integrity. 41
