SM UB-11 was a German German Type UB I submarine Type UB I submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy lang-de Kaiserliche Marine during World War I. UB-11 was ordered in October 1914 and was keel laying laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in November. UB-11 was a little under convert 92 ft m in length and displacement ship displaced between convert 127 and 141 MT ST, depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun. She was launch ship launched and commission ship commissioned as SM UB-11 in March 1915.SM stands for Seiner Majestt lang-en His Majesty's and combined with the U for Unterseeboot would be translated as His Majesty's Submarine.

UB-11's commanding officer at commissioning only remained in charge of the ship for a week. Sources do not report any more commanding officers assigned through the end of the war, so it's not clear if the submarine remained in commission. UB-11 was reported in use as a training vessel at Kiel in September 1915. The U-boat made no war patrols and sank no ships during the war, which may indicate that the vessel remained in a training role. At the end of the war, UB-11 was deemed unseaworthy and unable to surrender at Harwich with the rest of Germany's U-boat fleet. She remained in Germany where she was ship breaking broken up by Stinnes in February 1920.

 Design and construction 
After the German Army German Empire German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders.Miller, pp. 4647.Karau, p. 48. Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914, produced the German Type UB I submarine Type UB I design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about convert 92 ft m long and displacing about convert 125 MT ST with two torpedo tubes.A further refinement of the designreplacing the torpedo tubes with mine naval mine chutes but changing little elseevolved into the German Type UC I submarine Type UC I coastal minelayer minelaying submarine. See: Miller, p. 458.

UB-11 was part of the initial allotment of seven submarinesnumbered SMU UB-9  2 to SMU UB-15  2ordered on 15 October from AG Weser of Bremen, just shy of two months after planning for the class began.Williamson, p. 12. UB-11 was keel laying laid down by Weser in Bremen on 7 November. As built, UB-11 was convert 91 ft 6 in m long, convert 10 ft 6 in m beam nautical abeam, and had a draft ship draft of convert 9 ft 10 in m. She had a single convert 60 bhp adj=on Krting Hannover Krting 4-cylinder diesel engine for surface travel, and a single convert 120 shp adj=on Siemens-Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel, both attached to a single propeller shaft ship propeller shaft. Her top speeds were convert 7.45 knots km/h, surfaced, and convert 6.24 knots km/h, submerged. At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to convert 1500 nmi km on the surface before refueling, and up to convert 45 nmi km submerged before recharging her batteries. Like all boats of the class, UB-11 was rated to a diving depth of convert 50 m ft, and could completely submerge in 33 seconds.

UB-11 was armed with two convert 45 cm in 1 sp=us adj=on torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was also outfitted for a single convert 8 mm in sp=us adj=on machine gun on deck. UB-11's standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.Karau, p. 49. After work on UB-11 was complete at the Weser yard, she was launch ship launched on 2 March.

 Career 
The submarine was commission ship commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM UB-11 on 4 March 1915 under the command of Kapitnleutnant Kapt. Ralph Wenninger, a 25-year-old first-time U-boat commander.cite Uboat.net   name = Ralph Wenninger   id = 398   type = 1comm   accessdate = 19 March 2009   dateformat = dmy Wenninger was in the Navy's April 1907 cadet class with 34 other future U-boat captains, including Werner Frbringer, Heino von Heimburg, Hans Howaldt, and Otto Steinbrinck. See: cite web   last = Helgason   first = Gumundur   title = WWI Officer Crews: Crew 4/07   url = http://uboat.net/wwi/men/commanders/crews.html?crew=4%2F07   work = U-Boat War in World War I   publisher = Uboat.net   date =    accessdate = 12 March 2009   dateformat = dmy  Wenninger was only in command of UB-11 for a week. Sources do not indicate who, if anyone, succeeded him as commander of UB-11, or if UB-11 remained in commission.

According to authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast, UB-11 had been assigned to the Kiel Periscope School by September 1915.Gibson and Prendergast, p. 63. Uboat.net reports that UB-11' undertook no war patrols and had no successes against enemy ships, which may indicate that the vessel remained in use only as a training vessel.

At the end of the war, the Allies of World War I Allies required all German U-boats to be sailed to Harwich for surrender. UB-11 was one of eight U-boats deemed unseaworthy and allowed to remain in Germany.Gibson and Prendergast, pp. 33132.The other seven boats were SMU U-1  2, SMU U-2  2, SMU U-4  2, SMU U-17  2, and three fellow German Type UB I submarine Type UB I boats, SMU UB-2  2, SMU UB-5  2, and SMU UB-9  2. UB-11 was ship breaking broken up by Stinnes on 3 February 1920.
