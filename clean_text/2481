George Lee &quot;Sparky&quot; Anderson (born February 22, 1934, in Bridgewater, South Dakota) is a former Major League Baseball manager. He managed the National League's Cincinnati Reds to the 1975 and 1976 championships, then added a third title in 1984 with the Detroit Tigers of the American League.
Anderson has resided for many years in Thousand Oaks, California. He was known as &quot;Sparky&quot; during his time in baseball, but in private life goes by his given name of &quot;George.&quot;
Playing career
Anderson was a &quot;good field, no-hit&quot; middle infielder who originally signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers' organization. He played for higher-level Dodger affiliates such as the Fort Worth Cats of the Texas League, the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League, and the Montreal Royals of the International League, but never appeared in a Dodger uniform at the MLB level. On December 23, 1958, he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for three players, including outfielder Rip Repulski &lt;U+2013&gt; enabling Anderson to play one full season in the Major Leagues, as the Phillies' regular second baseman in 1959. However, he batted only .218 in 152 games, with no home runs and 34 runs batted in, and returned to the minor leagues for the remainder of his playing career.
He played the next four seasons with the Triple-A Toronto Maple Leafs in the International League, where Leafs owner Jack Kent Cooke spotted Anderson's leadership qualities and encouraged him to pursue a career in managing. Finally, in 1964, at the age of 30, Anderson accepted Cooke's offer to manage the Leafs. He would later handle minor league clubs at the Class A and Double-A levels, including a season (1968) in the Reds' minor league system.
During this period, he managed a pennant winner in four consecutive seasons: 1965 with the Rock Hill Cardinals of the Western Carolinas League, 1966 with the St. Petersburg Cardinals of the Florida State League, 1967 with the Modesto Reds of the California League and 1968 with the Asheville Tourists of the Southern League. It was during the 1966 season that Sparky's club lost to Miami 4&lt;U+2013&gt;3 in 29 innings, which remains the longest pro game played (by innings) without interruption.
He made his way back to the majors in 1969 as a coach for the San Diego Padres. He was briefly a member of the California Angels coaching staff during the 1969&lt;U+2013&gt;70 offseason, but within days of being hired in Anaheim, he was offered the opportunity to succeed Dave Bristol as manager of the Reds. His appointment reunited Anderson with Reds' general manager Bob Howsam, who had hired him as a minor-league skipper in the St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati organizations.
Manager, Cincinnati Reds
Anderson won 102 games and the pennant in his first Major League season as manager of the Cincinnati Reds, but then lost the World Series in five games to the Baltimore Orioles. After an injury-plagued 1971 season, the Reds came back and won another pennant in 1972, but lost to the Oakland Athletics in the World Series. They took the National League West division title in 1973, then finished a close second to the Los Angeles Dodgers a year later.
Finally, in 1975, the Reds blew the division open by winning 108 games, swept the National League Championship Series and then edged the Boston Red Sox in a drama-filled, seven-game World Series. They repeated in 1976 by winning 102 games and ultimately sweeping the New York Yankees in the Series. Over the course of these two seasons, Anderson's Reds compiled an astounding 14&lt;U+2013&gt;3 record in postseason play against the Pirates, Phillies, Red Sox and Yankees, winning their last eight in a row in the postseason after triumphing against the Red Sox in Game 7 of the 1975 World Series, and then winning seven straight games in the 1976 postseason.
During this time, Anderson became known as &quot;Captain Hook&quot; for his penchant for taking out a starting pitcher at the first sign of weakness and going to his bullpen, relying heavily on closers Will McEnaney and Rawly Eastwick.
When the aging Reds finished second to the Dodgers in each of the next two seasons, Anderson was fired. The Reds won the division title again in 1979 but lost three straight to the Pittsburgh Pirates in the League Championship Series. They would not make the playoffs again until they won the World Series in 1990 by sweeping the heavily favored Oakland A's.
Manager, Detroit Tigers
Anderson moved on to the young Detroit Tigers after being hired as their new manager on June 14, 1979. The Tigers became a winning club almost immediately, but did not get into contention until 1983, when they finished second to the Baltimore Orioles.
In 1984, Detroit opened the season 35&lt;U+2013&gt;5 (a major league record) and breezed to a 104&lt;U+2013&gt;58 record (a franchise record for wins). They swept the Kansas City Royals in the American League Championship Series (ALCS) and then beat the San Diego Padres in five games in the World Series for Anderson's third world title. After the season, Anderson won the first of his two Manager of the Year Awards with the Tigers.
Anderson led the Tigers to the majors' best record in 1987, but the team was upset in the ALCS by the Minnesota Twins. He won his second Manager of the Year Award that year. After contending again in 1988 (finishing second to Boston by one game in the AL East), the team collapsed a year later, losing a startling 103 games. During that 1989 season, Anderson took a month-long leave of absence from the team as the stress of losing wore on him. First base coach Dick Tracewski managed the team in the interim.
In 1991, the Tigers finished last in batting average, first in batting strike outs and near the bottom of the league in most pitching categories, but still led their division in late August before settling for a second-place finish behind the rival Toronto. The team featured a power-packed lineup of sluggers Cecil Fielder, Mickey Tettleton and Rob Deer, which led the league in home runs and walks that season.
During his managerial career, Anderson was known to heap lavish praise on his ballplayers when talking to the media. He declared Kirk Gibson &quot;the next Mickey Mantle,&quot; which he later acknowledged may have put too much pressure on Gibson early in his career. He said Mike Laga, who played for him in 1984, would &quot;make us forget every power hitter who ever lived.&quot; He also said, &quot;Johnny Bench (who played for him in Cincinnati) will never throw a baseball as hard as Mike Heath (a catcher who played for him in Detroit).&quot;
Retirement
Anderson retired from managing after the 1995 season, reportedly disillusioned with the state of the league following the 1994 strike that had also truncated the beginning of the 1995 season. It is widely believed that Anderson was pushed into retirement by the Tigers, who were unhappy that Sparky refused to manage replacement players during spring training in 1995. He finished with a lifetime record of 2,194&lt;U+2013&gt;1,834, for a .545 percentage. He spent the larger portion of his career managing the Tigers (1970&lt;U+2013&gt;78 with the Reds, 1979&lt;U+2013&gt;95 with the Tigers), but he won two World Series with the Reds and one with the Tigers.
Anderson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame as a manager in 2000. His Hall of Fame plaque has him wearing a Cincinnati Reds uniform. He chose to wear the Reds cap at his induction in honor of former GM Bob Howsam, who gave Anderson his first chance at a major-league managing job.
Anderson was also inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame the same year. On May 28, 2005, during pre-game ceremonies in Cincinnati, Anderson's jersey number, #10, was retired by the Reds. A day in Anderson's honor was also held at Detroit's Comerica Park during the 2000 season. His number with the Detroit Tigers, #11, has been inactive since he retired in 1995, but has not been formally retired.
In 2006, construction was completed on the &quot;Sparky Anderson Baseball Field&quot; at California Lutheran University's new athletic complex. In 2007, Anderson was elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.
On November 3, 2010, it was announced that Anderson had been placed in hospice care at his Thousand Oaks home because of his deteriorating dementia condition.1
Legacy
Anderson became the first manager to win a World Series for both a National League and American League team. Either manager in the 1984 Series would have been the first to win in both leagues, since San Diego Padres (NL) manager Dick Williams had previously won the series with the Oakland Athletics (AL) in 1972 and 1973. Ironically, Williams' 1972 club defeated Sparky Anderson's Reds club.
Anderson's accomplishment was equalled in the 2006 World Series, when St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russawho had previously won the World Series with the Oakland Athletics in 1989, and who considers Anderson his mentorled his team to the title over the Detroit Tigers. Coincidentally, having won a championship while managing the Florida Marlins in 1997, Tigers manager Jim Leyland could have achieved this same feat had the Tigers defeated La Russa's Cardinals in the 2006 World Series.
With a 9&lt;U+2013&gt;5 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on July 29, 1986, Anderson became the first to achieve 600 career wins as a manager in both the American and National Leagues.
Media appearances

In 1979, Sparky guest-starred as himself on an episode of (appropriately enough) WKRP in Cincinnati. The episode (titled &quot;Sparky&quot;), features Anderson as a talk-show host on the fictional station. Eventually Sparky is let go, which causes him to say, &quot;I must be crazy. Every time I come to (Cincinnati) I get fired!&quot;
Anderson appeared as himself in The White Shadow season 3 episode &quot;If Your Number's Up, Get it Down&quot; in 1980. Falahey introduces him to Coolidge, but Coolidge replies with &quot;Sorry you lost, but I voted for you.&quot; Coolidge mistakenly thought he was 1980 independent presidential candidate John Anderson.
Anderson appears as himself in the 1983 Disney Channel movie Tiger Town.
Anderson was often paired with Jack Buck on CBS Radio coverage of post-season action during the 1980s and 1990s.
From 1996 to 1998, was a color analyst for the Anaheim Angels' cable television broadcasts.
Anderson threw out the ceremonial first pitch of Game 2 of the 2006 World Series at Comerica Park.
Anderson's number was retired in the 2000s by the Fort Worth Cats, who were a Dodgers affiliate in the 1950s when Anderson played there.
