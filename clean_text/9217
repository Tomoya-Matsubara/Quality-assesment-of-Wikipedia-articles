Suburban Journals is a group of 40 publications in the St. Louis region owned by Lee Enterprises.
The group, known as Suburban Journals of Greater St. Louis, publishes 31 community newspapers, the Ladue News and St. Louis' Best Bridal magazine. The chain reaches 637,000 households.1
Publications are grouped in regional offices, each with its own editor, in Town and Country, Mo.; Collinsville, Ill.; Festus, Mo.; Columbia, Ill.; St. Peters, Mo.; Warrenton, Mo.; and two in St. Louis.
The newspapers are independent of the Lee-owned St. Louis Post-Dispatch, but do share some resources, such a technical assistance. The companies, which were both previously owned by Pulitzer Inc., also share a common website, stltoday.com.
The chain's main competition is the Post-Dispatch and community-focused Webster-Kirkwood Times and South County Times in Missouri and Alton Telegraph and [Belleville News Democrat] in Illinois.
It is by some counts the largest community chain of newspapers in the country.2

History
Most of the publications currently owned by Suburban Journals date back to the early 1900s as independent newspapers. Many were in direct competition with one another.
In the early 1980s, several of the newspapers were bought by Ingersoll Publications Co., a firm headed by Ralph Ingersoll II, whose  father lead the innovative PM newspaper in 1940s New York City5.
Ingersoll, who wanted to compete with the Post Dispatch and now defunct St. Louis Globe-Democrat] used high-risk junk bonds to finance his acquisitions6.
Ingersoll, who considered starting a St. Louis daily with the closure of the Globe, in 1990 was bought out by his partner and financier, E.M. Warburg, Pincus &amp; Co., which formed a the Journal Register Co., the owner of 25 daily newspapers, including the New Haven Register and Alton Telegraph. The chain became the Suburban Journals of Greater St. Louis7.
In 1997, it bought the Ladue News8.
The company in 1999 had revenues of $151 million9.
Pulitzer, which owned the Post Dispatch and 11 other daily newspapers, in June 2000 bought the company, which then had 38 papers10. It cost $165 million11.
Pulitzer then sold the group to Lee in summer 2005 for $1.46 billion12.
