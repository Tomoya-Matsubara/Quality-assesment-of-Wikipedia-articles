John Sherman Cooper (August 23, 1901 - February 21, 1991) was a politician, jurist, and diplomat from the US state of Kentucky. He served three non-consecutive, partial terms in the United States Senate before being elected to two full terms in 1960 and 1966. He also served as U.S Ambassador to India from 1955 to 1956 and U.S. Ambassador to East Germany from 1974 to 1976. He was the first Republican to be popularly elected to more than one term as a senator from Kentucky, and in both 1960 and 1966, he set records for the largest victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate from either party.
Cooper's first political service was as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1927 to 1929. In 1930, he was elected county judge of Pulaski County. After a failed gubernatorial bid in 1939, he joined the Army in 1942. During World War II, he earned the Bronze Star Medal for reorganizing the Bavarian judicial system after the allied victory in Europe. While still in Germany, he was elected circuit judge for Kentucky's 28th district. He returned home to accept the judgeship, which he held for less than a year before resigning to seek election to A. B. &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler's vacated seat in the U.S. Senate. He won the seat by 41,823 votes, the largest victory margin by any Republican for any office in Kentucky at the time.
During his first term in the Senate, Cooper voted with the majority of his party just 51% of the time. He was defeated in his re-election bid in 1948, after which he accepted an appointment by President Harry S. Truman as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly and served as a special assistant to Secretary of State Dean Acheson during the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Cooper was again elected to a partial term the Senate in 1952. The popular Cooper was likely to be re-elected in 1954 until the Democrats nominated former Vice-President Alben W. Barkley. Cooper lost the general election and was appointed Ambassador to India by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1955. Cooper gained the confidence of Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and dramatically improved relations between the U.S. and the recently-independent state of India, helping rebuff Soviet hopes of expanding Communism in Asia. Barkley died in 1956, and Eisenhower requested that Cooper seek Barkley's open seat. Cooper reluctantly acquiesced and was elected to serve out the rest of Barkley's term.
In 1960, Cooper was re-elected, securing his first full, six-year term in the Senate. Newly-elected President John F. Kennedy &lt;U+2013&gt; Cooper's former Senate colleague &lt;U+2013&gt; chose Cooper to conduct a secret fact-finding mission to Moscow and New Delhi. Following Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Cooper to the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination. Cooper soon became an outspoken opponent of Johnson's decision to escalate U.S. military involvement in the Vietnam War, consistently advocating for negotiation with the North Vietnamese instead. After Cooper's re-election in 1966, he worked with Idaho Democrat Frank Church on a series of amendments designed to de-fund further U.S. military operations in the region. These amendments were hailed as the first serious attempt by Congress to curb presidential authority over military operations during an ongoing war. Aging and increasingly deaf, Cooper did not seek re-election in 1972. His last acts of public service were as Ambassador to East Germany from 1974 to 1976 and as an alternate delegate to the United Nations in 1981. He died in a Washington, D.C. retirement home on February 21, 1991 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.
Early life
John Sherman Cooper was born August 23, 1901, in Somerset, Kentucky.1 He was the second child and first son of the seven children born to John Sherman and Helen Gertrude (Tartar) Cooper.2 The Cooper family had been prominent in the Somerset area since brothers Malachi and Edward Cooper migrated from South Carolina along the Wilderness Trail and through the Cumberland Gap shortly after Daniel Boone.3 His father's parents were staunch Baptists who were active in the anti-slavery movement in the nineteenth century, and the elder John Sherman Cooper (called &quot;Sherman&quot;) was named after the Apostle John and William Tecumseh Sherman, a hero of the Union in the Civil War.4 The family was very active in local politics; six of Cooper's ancestors, including his father, were elected county judges in Pulaski County, and two had been circuit judges.5 Sherman Cooper engaged in numerous successful business ventures and was known as the wealthiest man in Somerset.67 At the time of John Sherman Cooper's birth, his father was serving as collector of internal revenue in Kentucky's 8th congressional district, a position to which he had been appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt.8
During his youth, Cooper worked delivering newspapers and in railroad yards and his father's coal mines in Harlan County.9 Despite having formerly served as county school superintendent, Cooper's father had a low opinion of the public schools, and until he was in the fifth grade, Cooper was privately tutored by a neighbor.1011 While his father was away on business in Texas, his mother sent him to sixth grade at the public school, which he attended thereafter.12 At Somerset High School, he played both basketball and football.13 After the outbreak of World War I, Cooper joined an informal military training unit at the high school.14 Two of the school's instructors organized the boys into two companies, but Cooper, who was given the rank of captain, later recalled that &quot;they taught us how to march and that's about all.&quot;15 During his senior year, Cooper served as class president and class poet.16 In 1918, he graduated second in his high school class and was chosen to give the commencement speech.1718
After graduation, Cooper matriculated at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky.19 While at Centre, Cooper was accepted into the Beta Theta Pi fraternity.20 He also played defensive end on the Praying Colonels' football team.21 Cooper was a letterman on the team, playing alongside football notables Bo McMillan, Red Roberts, Matty Bell, and Red Weaver.22 Another member of the team, John Y. Brown, Sr., would later become one of Cooper's political rivals.23 Coached by Charley Moran, the team was undefeated in four games in the 1918 season, which was shortened by an outbreak of the Spanish flu.24
Although Centre was known as one of Kentucky's foremost colleges in academic quality, Cooper's father wanted him to broaden his education, and after one year at Centre, Cooper transferred to Yale College.25 At Yale, he was a classmate of his future U.S. Senate colleague, Stuart Symington.26 Cooper was active in many extracurricular activities at Yale, including the Sophomore German Committee, the Junior Promenade Committee, the Student Council, the Class Day Committee, the Southern Club, the University Club, and Beta Theta Pi.27 A member of the Undergraduate Athletic Association, he played football and basketball, becoming the first person in Yale history to be named captain of the basketball team in both his junior and senior years.28 In his senior year, he was accepted into the Skull and Bones society but regretted not being accepted into Phi Beta Kappa.29 Upon graduation, he was voted most popular and most likely to succeed in his class.30
Cooper earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale in 1923 and enrolled at Harvard Law School later that year.31 During the summer break of 1924, he returned to Kentucky, where his father, dying of Bright's disease, told him that he would soon become the head of the family, and that most of the family's resources had been lost in the economic recession of the early 1920s.3233 Cooper returned to Harvard after his father's death, but soon discovered that the could not simultaneously pursue a law degree and manage his family's affairs.34 He was admitted to the bar by examination in 1928 and opened a legal practice in Somerset.35 Over the next 20 years, he sold his father's remaining assets, paid off the family debts, and financed a college education for his six brothers and sisters.36
Early political career
After being urged into politics by his uncle, Judge Roscoe Tarter, Cooper ran unopposed for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives as a Republican in 1927.37 As a member of the House, he was one of only three Republicans to oppose Republican Governor Flem D. Sampson's unsuccessful attempt to politicize the state department of health; the measure failed by a single vote.3839 Cooper supported the governor's plan to provide free textbooks for the state's school children and sponsored legislation to prohibit judges from issuing injunctions to end labor strikes, although the latter bill did not pass.4041
In 1929, Cooper declared his candidacy for county judge of Pulaski County.42 His opponent, the incumbent, was the president of Somerset Bank and was formerly the law partner of Cooper's father.43 Cooper won the election, however, beginning the first of his eight years as county judge.44 During his service, he was required by law to enforce eviction notices, but often helped those he evicted find other housing or gave them money himself, earning him the nickname &quot;the poor man's judge&quot;.45 He reportedly became so depressed by the poverty and suffering of his constituents during the Great Depression that he had a nervous breakdown and took a leave of absence to seek psychiatric treatment.46
Cooper served on the board of trustees for the University of Kentucky from 1935 to 1946.47 In 1939, he sought the Republican gubernatorial nomination.48 As a result of a mandatory primary election law passed in 1935, the Republican nominee would not be chosen by a nominating convention, as was typical for the party.49 Cooper garnered only 36% of the vote in the primary, losing the nomination to Lexington circuit court judge and former Congressman King Swope.50
Service in World War II
Even though at 41 years old, he was well above the draft age, in 1942 Cooper enlisted for service in the United States Army in World War II.51 He turned down an immediately-offered officer's commission and chose to enlist as a private.52 After basic training, he enrolled in Officer Candidate School at the Fort Custer Training Center in Michigan.53 He studied military government and graduated second in his class of 111 students.5455 In 1943, he was commissioned a second lieutenant and assigned to the 15th Corps of General George Patton's Third Army as a courier in the military police.56 Under Patton, Cooper served in France, Luxembourg, and Germany.57 Patton ordered all of his unit, including Cooper, to tour the Buchenwald concentration camp just hours after its liberation.58
Following the cessation of hostilities in the war, Cooper oversaw the reorganization of the 239 courts in the German state of Bavaria, replacing all the Nazi officials, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal.59 Among the judges installed by Cooper were Wilhelm Hoegner, future Minister-President of Bavaria, and Ludwig Erhard, the future Chancellor of Germany.60 Cooper also served as a legal advisor for the 300,000 displaced persons in his unit's occupation zone seeking repatriation after being brought to Germany as slaves by the Nazis.61 Under the terms of the agreement reached at the Yalta Conference, all displaced Russian nationals were to be returned to the Soviet Union, but Soviet negotiators decided that the agreement did not apply to non-Russian spouses and children of the nationals.62 Cooper brought this to the attention of General Patton, who rescinded the repatriation order in his unit's occupation zone.63 He received a citation from the Third Army's military government section for his action.64
In 1944, while he was still in the Army, Cooper married Evelyn Pfaff, a registered nurse.65 Cooper was elected without opposition as circuit judge of Kentucky's twenty-eighth judicial district in 1945, despite still being in Germany and not campaigning for the office.66 He was discharged from the Army with the rank of captain in February 1946 and returned to Kentucky to assume the judgeship to which he had been elected.67
First term in the Senate and early diplomatic career
Cooper's judicial district included his native Pulaski County, as well as Rockcastle, Wayne and Clinton counties.68 During his tenure, blacks were allowed to serve on trial juries in the district for the first time.69 Of the first 16 opinions he issued during his time on the bench, 15 were upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Kentucky's court of last resort at the time.70
 Cooper resigned his judgeship in November 1946 to seek the U.S. Senate seat vacated when A. B. &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler resigned to accept the position of Commissioner of Baseball.71 Cooper's opponent, former Congressman and Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives John Y. Brown, Sr., was better known and widely believed to be the favorite in the race.72 However, Brown had alienated Chandler's supporters in the Democratic Party during a hotly-contested senatorial primary between Brown and Chandler in 1942, and this group worked against his election in 1946.73 Further, the Louisville Courier-Journal opposed Brown because of his attacks on former Senator J. C. W. Beckham and Judge Robert Worth Bingham, who were heads of a powerful political machine in Louisville.74 With these two factors working against Brown, Cooper won the election to fill Chandler's unexpired term by 41,823 votes, the largest victory margin by any Republican for any office in Kentucky at the time.7576 His victory marked only the third time in Kentucky's history that a Republican had been popularly elected to the Senate.77 The move to Washington, D.C. proved to be too much for Cooper's already strained marriage.78 In 1947, he filed for divorce, charging abandonment.79
Cooper described himself as &quot;a truly terrible public speaker&quot; and rarely made addresses from the Senate floor.80 He was known as an independent Republican during his career in the Senate.81 In the first roll-call vote of his career, he opposed transferring investigatory powers to Republican Owen Brewster's special War Investigating Committee.82 His second vote, directing that proceeds from the sale of war surplus material be used to pay off war debts, also went against the majority of the Republican caucus, prompting Ohio Republican Robert A. Taft to ask him &quot;Are you a Republican or a Democrat? When are you going to start voting with us?&quot;83 Cooper responded, &quot;If you'll pardon me, I was sent here to represent my constituents, and I intend to vote as I think best.&quot;84
A few days after being sworn in, Cooper co-sponsored his first piece of legislation, a bill to provide federal aid for education.85 The bill passed the Senate, but not the House.86 Cooper was made chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Roads, and helped draft a bill authorized $900 million in federal funds to states for highway construction.87 In 1948, he sponsored a bill to provide price support for burley tobacco at 90 percent of parity.88 He insisted on an amendment to the War Claims Act of 1948 that benefits to veterans injured as prisoners of the Germans and Japanese during World War II be paid immediately using enemy assets.89 He also co-sponsored legislation allowing hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the Nazis to enter the United States legally.90 In the area of organized labor, he opposed bans on industrywide collective bargaining and on the establishment of closed shops.91 He voted against putting union welfare funds under government control, but helped to pass an amendment forbidding compulsory union membership for workers.92
Cooper continued his independence from his party throughout his term, vocally opposing Republican plans to cut taxes despite record national budget deficits and resisted the party's efforts to reduce funding for the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe in the aftermath of the war.93 He worked with fellow Kentuckian Alben Barkley and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse to undermine Jim Crow laws enacted by the states and remove obstacles to suffrage for minorities.94 He also co-sponsored a bill to create the Medicare system, although it was defeated at the time.95 At the end of his partial term in the Senate, he had voted with the Republicans just 51% of the time &lt;U+2013&gt; the lowest average of any member of the party.96 Despite his party independence, Cooper headed the Kentucky delegation to the 1948 Republican National Convention.97 He supported Arthur Vandenberg for president, but Thomas E. Dewey ultimately received the party's nomination.98 Cooper himself was mentioned as a possible candidate for vice-president, but ultimately did not receive the nomination and sought re-election to his Senate seat instead.99 Also in 1948, Centre College awarded Cooper an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.100
Cooper was opposed in his re-election bid by Democratic Congressman Virgil M. Chapman, an ally of Earle C. Clements, who had been elected governor in 1947.101 As one of only a few Democrats who had voted in favor of the Taft-Hartley Act, Chapman had lost the support of organized labor, a key constituency for the Democrats.102 The Democratic-leaning Louisville Times endorsed Cooper, but the presence of Kentucky's favorite son, Alben Barkley, on the ballot as Harry S. Truman's running mate in the 1948 presidential election ensured a strong Democratic turnout in the state.103104 Both Barkley and Clements stressed party unity during the campaign, and although Cooper polled much better than the Republican presidential ticket, he ultimately lost to Chapman in the general election by 24,480 votes.105
Following his defeat, Cooper resumed the practice of law in the Washington, D.C. law firm of Gardner, Morison and Rogers.106 In 1949, President Truman appointed Cooper as one of five delegates to the United Nations General Assembly.107 He was an alternate delegate to that body in 1950 and 1951.108 Secretary of State Dean Acheson chose Cooper as his advisor to meetings that created North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and at meetings of the NATO Council of Ministers in London in May 1950 and Brussels in December 1950.109 Political historian Glenn Finch observed that, while Cooper was well-qualified for his duties at the U.N. and NATO, his presence abroad also made him less available to campaign for the Senate seat vacated by Barkley's elevation to the vice-presidency.110 Speculation was raised that Clements, who won Barkley's old seat in a special election in 1950, may have influenced Truman and Acheson to make the appointments.111
Second term in the Senate
Cooper's supporters believed he would again seek the governorship of Kentucky or be appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States in the early 1950s; some even formed a committee to elect Cooper president.112 Cooper considered running for governor in 1951, but when Senator Chapman was killed in an automobile accident on March 8, 1951, he decided to make another run for the Senate against Thomas R. Underwood, Governor Lawrence Wetherby's appointee to fill the vacancy.113 Underwood was considered a heavy favorite in the race. Some Republicans faulted Cooper for taking an appointment from Democratic president Harry Truman.114 Both the Louisville Times and the Louisville Courier-Journal recanted their statements in 1950 that Cooper should seek election to the Senate in 1954; they now feared that the election of a Republican would allow that party to organize the Senate, giving key committee chairmanships to isolationists opposed to continued U.S. involvement in the Korean War.115 Nevertheless, Cooper defeated Underwood by 29,000 votes in the election to serve out the remainder of Chapman's term.116 His victory marked the first time in Kentucky's history that a Republican had been elected to the Senate more than once.117
Cooper was named to the Senate Committee on Labor, Education and Public Welfare and chaired its education and labor subcommittees.118 He sponsored a bill authorizing public works projects along the Big Sandy River, including the Tug and Levisa forks.119 He also supported the reconstruction of the locks and dams along the Ohio River and the construction of locks, dams, and reservoirs in the Green River Valley.120 He opposed the Dixon-Yates contract, which would have paid a private company to construct a new power station to generate power for the city of Memphis, Tennessee, calling instead for authorization for the Tennessee Valley Authority to issue bonds to finance the construction of new power stations.121 He supported a comprehensive program benefiting the coal industry and co-sponsored a bill to extending public library services to rural areas.122
Cooper continued to be an independent voice in the Senate. During the Red Scare, he was critical of attempts to permit illegal wiretap evidence in federal courts and attempts to reduce the protections against self-incrimination granted by the Fifth Amendment.123 Nevertheless, he refused to support stripping Joseph McCarthy, the leading figure in the Red Scare, of his major Senate committee chairmanships, cautioning that &quot;Many of those who bitterly oppose Senator McCarthy call for the same tactics that they charge him with.&quot;124 He was the only Republican to oppose the Bricker Amendment, which would have limited the president's treaty-making power, because he concluded that the issues addressed by the amendment were not sufficient to warrant a change to the Constitution.125 He also opposed the Submerged Lands Act and the Mexican Farm Labor bill, both of which were supported by the Eisenhower administration.126 He denounced Eisenhower's appointment of Albert M. Cole, an open opponent of public housing, as Federal Housing Administrator and opposed many of the agricultural reforms proposed by Eisenhower's Agriculture Secretary, Ezra Taft Benson.127 Again, his independence did little to diminish his stature in the party. In 1954, he was named to the Senate Republican Policy Committee.128
Cooper again sought re-election in 1954.129 Democrats first considered Governor Wetherby as his opponent, but Wetherby's candidacy would have drawn a primary challenger from the Happy Chandler faction of the Democratic Party, possibly leading to a party split and Cooper's re-election.130 Instead, party leaders convinced outgoing Vice-President Barkley, now 77 years old, to run for the seat in order to ensure party unity.131 There were few policy differences between Barkley and Cooper, who had been deemed the most liberal Republican in the Senate by Americans for Democratic Action.132133 During the campaign, Cooper was featured on the cover of Time magazine on July 5, 1954.134 Cooper appealed to women voters who were concerned about the increasingly tense situation in Southeast Asia and to black voters because of his stands in favor of civil rights.135 He also claimed that he would be a less partisan Senator than Barkley.136 Barkley's personal popularity carried him to a 71,000-vote victory, however.137 Glenn Finch opined that &quot;Barkley was unbeatable in his own state, and it is probable that no other candidate could have defeated Cooper.&quot;138
Ambassador to India
In 1955, President Dwight D. Eisenhower nominated Cooper as U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal.139 During his time as a delegate for the United Nations, Cooper had met Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and established a cordial working relationship with the Indian delegation, including Nehru's sister Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit.140 The Indians had been impressed with Cooper and the Indian government had expressed their desire that Cooper serve as their ambassador from the U.S.141 Cooper initially rejected the offer of the Indian ambassadorship from Secretary of State John Foster Dulles but was convinced to accept it by a personal request from President Eisenhower.142 The Senate confirmed Cooper's nomination on February 4, 1955.143
India had only become an independent nation in 1948, and it was considered a potential bulwark against Communism in Asia.144 U.S.-India relations were strained, however, because of India's recognition of Communist China, its opposition to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), and its resistance to foreign interference in Indochina.145 U.S. News and World Report described the ambassadorship as &quot;one of the most difficult and delicate in all the diplomatic world&quot;.146
Cooper married Lorraine Rowan Shelvin on March 17, 1955, in Pasadena, California, just ten days before leaving for India.147148 Twice divorced, Shelvin was the daughter of a wealthy California real estate developer, step-daughter of Vatican official Prince Domenico Orsini, and a well-known socialite.149 She was fluent in three languages and also understood Russian.150 The two had dated for much of the 1950s, but Cooper was hesitant to marry because he had doubts about moving into Shelvin's elaborate Georgetown home.151 (While in Washington, the unmarried Cooper permanently resided in the Dodge House Hotel.)152 The move to India removed this barrier, and Secretary of State Dulles encouraged Cooper to marry her before leaving so that the U.S. embassy in New Delhi might have a proper hostess.153 On April 4, 1955, the couple stopped in England on their way to India to visit with Louis Mountbatten, the last Governor-General of India prior to India's achieving its independence.154 Their discussions about the situation of the Indian people was part of the scant preparation Cooper received before arriving there.155
 Cooper began his service as ambassador by developing a close personal friendship with Prime Minister Nehru.156 Nehru's respect and admiration for Cooper soon became widely known.157 Cooper labored to help officials in Washington, D.C. understand that India's reluctance to align with either the West or the Communists in China and the Soviet Union was their way of exercising their newly-won independence.158 At the same time, he defended the U.S. military buildup after World War II, its involvement in the Korean War, and its membership in mutual security pacts like NATO and SEATO as self-defense measures, not aggressive actions by the U.S. government, as the Indians widely perceived them.159 Cooper condemned the Eisenhower administration's decision to sell weapons to Pakistan, which was resented by the Indians, but also felt that the Indian government took some political positions without regard to their moral implications.160 By late 1955, the Chicago Daily News reported that Indo-American relations had &quot;improved to a degree not thought possible six months ago&quot;.161
In a joint communiqu&lt;U+00E9&gt; dated December 2, 1955, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and Portuguese Foreign Minister Paulo Cunha condemned statements made by Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin and Soviet Party Chairman Nikita Krushchev during an eighteen-day tour of India.162 Of particular interest was the communiqu&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s reference to &quot;Portuguese provinces in the Far East&quot;.163 This phrase referred to Goa, a Portuguese colony in western India.164 Although most European nations with holdings near India had granted them to the new independent nation in 1947, Portugal refused to surrender Goa, and the region had become a source of conflict between the two nations.165 The joint communiqu&lt;U+00E9&gt; seemed to indicate U.S. recognition of Portuguese sovereignty in Goa, which undercut Cooper's assurances to the Indians of U.S. neutrality in the matter.166 Cooper himself did not know about the communiqu&lt;U+00E9&gt; until he read an account of it in the Indian media and was therefore unprepared to offer an explanation for it when asked by the Indian Foreign Secretary.167 Cooper's cable to Washington, D.C. about the matter was reported to have been &quot;bitter&quot;, although the contents of the cable have not been released.168
The Dulles-Cuhna communiqu&lt;U+00E9&gt; touched off anti-American demonstrations in many parts of India.169 On December 6, Dulles held a news conference during which he reaffirmed U.S. neutrality on the Goa issue, but did not recant claims of Portuguese sovereignty over the region.170 Prime Minister Nehru announced his intent to file a formal protest to the United States over the communiqu&lt;U+00E9&gt; and to address the Indian Parliament about the matter.171 In the interim, Cooper secured a meeting with Nehru and forestalled both actions.172 Cooper became even more upset with Dulles when Dulles authorized withholding $10 million of a $50 million aid package to India; Cooper protested the withholding, and Dulles decided to pay the full amount.173
Throughout the early part of 1956, Cooper strongly advocated that the U.S. respect Indian nonalignment and increase economic aid to the country.174 In August 1956, Congress approved a financial aid package for India that included the largest sale of surplus agricultural products by the United States to any country to that time in history.175 Cooper's persistence in requesting such aid was critical in getting the package approved, as it was opposed by many administration officials, including John B. Hollister, Herbert Hoover, Jr., and George M. Humphrey.176
Later service in the Senate
 Senator Barkley died in office on April 30, 1956.177 Republican leaders encouraged Cooper to return from India and seek the seat, but Cooper was reluctant to give up his ambassadorship.178 After a personal appeal from President Eisenhower, however, Cooper acquiesced and declared his candidacy in July 1956.179 Even after leaving India, he maintained close ties with the country's leaders and was the official U.S. representative at the funerals of Prime Minister Nehru in 1964, Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri in 1966, and Prime Minister Indira Ghandi in 1984.180
Because Barkley's death occurred after the filing deadline for the November elections, the Democratic State Central Committee had to choose a nominee for the now-open seat.181 After unsuccessfully attempting to find a compromise candidate that both the Clements and Chandler factions could support, they chose Lawrence Wetherby, whose term as governor had recently expired.182 Chandler, now serving his second term as governor, was angered by the choice of Wetherby, and most members of his faction either gave Wetherby lukewarm support or outright supported Cooper instead.183 This, combined with Cooper's personal popularity, led to his victory over Wetherby by 65,000 votes.184
Upon his return to the Senate in 1957, Cooper was assigned to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.185 In 1959, he challenged Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen to become the Republican floor leader in the Senate, but lost by four votes.186 In a 1960 poll of fifty journalists conducted by Newsweek magazine, Cooper was named the ablest Republican member of the Senate.187 He helped author and co-sponsored the National Defense Education Act.188 Together with Senator Jennings Randolph, he sponsored the Appalachian Regional Development Act, which was designed to address the prevalent poverty in Appalachia.189 He succeeded in gaining more state and local control over the anti-poverty group Volunteers in Service to America.190 He was a vigorous opponent of measures designed to weaken the Tennessee Valley Authority.191
In 1960, Democrats nominated former governor Keen Johnson, then an executive with Reynolds Metals, to oppose Cooper's re-election bid.192 Cooper had the support of organized labor and benefitted from a large segment of Kentuckians who voted for Republican Richard M. Nixon over Democrat John F. Kennedy as a reaction against Kennedy's Catholicism in the 1960 presidential election.193 Cooper ultimately defeated Johnson by 199,257 votes, a record victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate of either party.194
Shortly after his election as president in 1960, Kennedy chose Cooper to conduct a then-secret mission to Moscow and New Delhi to assess the attitudes of the Soviet government toward the new administration.195 Kennedy and Cooper had served together on the Senate Labor Committee and maintained a social friendship.196 On the mission, Cooper discovered that the Soviets disliked Kennedy and Nixon equally.197 Overall, Cooper's report to Kennedy regarding the potential for harmonious relations with the Soviets was extremely pessimistic.198 After meeting with Secretary Khruschev, Kennedy confirmed to Cooper that his report had been correct and confessed that he wished he'd taken it even more seriously.199 Cooper supported Kennedy's decision to resume nuclear weapons testing after the Soviets resumed their testing in March 1962, but he urged Kennedy to negotiate an agreement with the Soviets if possible.200
President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Cooper to the Warren Commission, which was charged with investigating Kennedy's assassination in 1963.201 As one of three Republicans on the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, he was involved with the investigation of Johnson aide Bobby Baker in 1964, which he decried as &quot;a whitewash&quot; when the committee blocked further investigation.202 He proposed the establishment of a Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct in July 1964 and was named to that committee in July 1965.203 Also in 1965, he was chosen advisor to the United States delegation to the Manila Conference establishing the Asian Development Bank.204
An advocate for small businesses and agricultural interests, Cooper opposed an April 1965 bill that expanded the powers of the Federal Trade Commission to regulate cigarette advertising.205 In March 1966, he proposed an amendment to a mine safety bill supported by the United Mine Workers of America that would have nullified provisions of the bill if they were not shown to contribute to the safety of small mines, but his amendment was defeated.206
Opposition to the Vietnam War
Although he voted in favor of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Cooper opposed escalating U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.207 As early as April 1964, Cooper was urging President Johnson to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the tensions in Southeast Asia.208 He questioned Southeast Asia's strategic importance to the U.S. and expressed concerns about the feasibility of deploying the U.S. military on a global scale.209 On March 25, 1965, he joined New York Senator Jacob Javits in a call for President Johnson to begin negotiations for a settlement between North Vietnam and South Vietnam without imposing preconditions on the negotiations.210 Later in the day, he introduced resolutions calling for Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to brief the full Senate on recent developments in Vietnam.211
In January 1966, Cooper accompanied Secretary of State Rusk and Ambassador W. Averell Harriman on an official visit to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos as part of a widely publicized &quot;peace drive&quot;.212 This visit, along with visits to South Vietnam in December 1965 and January 1966, reinforced Cooper's opposition to military operations in Southeast Asia.213 In a meeting with President Johnson on January 26, 1966, he again urged the president to forego his announced intentions to resume bombing missions in North Vietnam and negotiate a settlement instead.214 Johnson was non-committal, and that afternoon, Cooper returned to the Senate floor, urgently trying to convince the legislators that negotiation was preferable to escalation, even when it meant negotiating with the Viet Cong fighters in South Vietnam, which he believed was necessary to achieve peace.215 Cooper advocated for a three to five year cease fire, enforced by the United Nations, followed by national elections as prescribed by the 1954 Geneva Convention.216 Ultimately, Johnson did not heed Cooper's plea and resumed U.S. bombing missions in North Vietnam.217
In 1966, Cooper again won re-election over John Y. Brown, Sr. by 217,000 votes, breaking his own record of largest victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate, and carrying the vote of 110 of Kentucky's 120 counties.218219 In the lead-up to the 1968 Republican presidential primary, he threw his support behind New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, saying that Americans would only support a candidate who took a clear position on Vietnam.220 Rockefeller had laid out a plan for reversing the Americanization of the war, while other Republican candidates tried to remain non-specific about how they would handle it.221 As Rockefeller's candidacy faded, Cooper encouraged his colleague, Kentucky Senator Thruston B. Morton, to seek the presidency, but Morton declined.222 The nomination &lt;U+2013&gt; and eventually, the presidency &lt;U+2013&gt; went to Republican Richard M. Nixon.223
As a delegate to the U.N. General Assembly in 1968, Cooper strongly denounced the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.224 He also supported Montana Senator Mike Mansfield's proposal to bring the matter of the Vietnam War before the United Nations.225 Returning to the Senate in 1969, he joined Alaska Senator Ernest Gruening and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse in protesting restrictions on orderly protests at the United States Capitol.226
In the Senate, Cooper helped lead the opposition to the development and deployment of anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs), which had put him at odds with many in his party, including President Nixon.227 Cooper had long been an opponent of ABMs, which he believed could intensify a worldwide nuclear arms race.228 On August 6, 1969, a vote to suspend funding of the development of ABMs failed in the Senate by a vote of 50&lt;U+2013&gt;51, with Vice-President Spiro Agnew casting the tie-breaking vote.229 After this defeat, Cooper and Michigan Senator Philip Hart co-sponsored the Cooper-Hart Amendment that would have allowed funding for research and development of ABMs, but banned deployment of a U.S. ABM system.230 The measure failed by three votes but increased congressional scrutiny of the Defense Department budget, leading to a reduction in funding and hastening Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviets.231 Cooper served as an advisor to President Nixon during the events leading up to the talks.232
 Throughout 1969 and 1970, Cooper and Senator Frank Church co-sponsored amendments, known as the Cooper-Church Amendments, aimed at curbing further escalation of the Vietnam War.233 Congressional approval of one of these amendments on December 15, 1969, de-funded the use of U.S. troops in Laos and Thailand.234 Cooper had wanted to include a restriction on forces entering Cambodia as well, but Mike Mansfield, who helped Cooper write the amendment, feared that Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who was officially neutral in the conflict, might be offended.235 When Sihanouk was deposed in 1970, Cambodia's new leader, Lon Nol, appealed to President Nixon for help in stabilizing his rule.236 Nixon agreed to send troops to Cambodia, despite protests from Cooper and others that this violated his stated goal of de-escalation in the region.237 Cooper and Church then drafted another amendment to de-fund U.S. operations in Cambodia; after negotiations with Nixon that continued funding until July 1970 so that the troops already in the country could be evacuated, the amendment passed 58&lt;U+2013&gt;37.238 The House of Representatives later stripped the amendment from the legislation to which it was attached, and it did not go into effect.239 The amendment was nevertheless hailed by The Washington Post as &quot;the first time in our history that Congress has attempted to limit the deployment of American troops in the course of an ongoing war.&quot;240 The fight over the Cooper-Church Amendments took its toll on Cooper's health, and he was briefly hospitalized to regain his strength.241 In 1971, Church, Mansfield, and George Aiken convinced Cooper to help them write an amendment to end U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia altogether, but ultimately, the measure did not have the support to pass and was abandoned.242
Seventy-one years of age and becoming increasingly deaf, Cooper announced to the Kentucky Press Association on January 21, 1972 that he would not seek re-election to his Senate seat.243 Over all his terms in the Senate, he had served longer in that body than any other Kentuckian except Alben Barkley.244 After an aggressive North Vietnamese offensive against the South in March 1972 intensified fighting in the region once again, the lame duck Cooper decided to make one more attempt to end the war.245 Without advance notice, Cooper addressed a nearly empty Senate chamber on July 27, 1972, proposing an amendment to a military assistance bill that would unconditionallly end funding for all U.S. military operations in Indochina in four months.246 The measure, which had no co-sponsors, stunned Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and provoked heated debate in the Senate.247 Massachusetts Senator Edward Brooke saved the amendment from almost certain demise by adding a provision that all American prisoners of war be returned prior to the withdrawal of U.S. forces.248 The revised amendment passed 62&lt;U+2013&gt;33, whereupon Nixon decided to sacrifice the entire military assistance bill.249 At Nixon's insistence, the Senate defeated the amended bill 48&lt;U+2013&gt;42.250 Disappointed, Cooper nevertheless proclaimed, &quot;I feel purged inside. I&lt;U+2019&gt;ve felt strongly about this for a long time. Now it's in the hands of the President. He's the only person who can do anything about ending the war now.&quot;251
Later career, death, and legacy
After the expiration of his term, Cooper took over the &quot;Dean Acheson chair&quot; at the prestigious Washington, D.C. law firm of Covington &amp; Burling.252 In 1972, he was chosen as the commencement speaker at Centre College, where he'd served as a trustee since 1961.253 At the ceremony, he became the first recipient of the Isaac Shelby Award, named for two-time Kentucky governor Isaac Shelby, who was chair of the college's first board of trustees.254 In 1973, Cooper resisted an attempt to name a federal building in his honor.255 Upon the completion of the dam that formed Laurel River Lake in 1977, Congress proposed naming the dam and lake after Cooper, but again, he declined.256 He was pleased, however, that the Somerset school system chose to name a program to teach and reinforce leadership skills the John Sherman Cooper Leadership Institute.257
In April 1974, President Nixon announced that he would appoint Cooper to be the U.S. Ambassador to East Germany, but during the final negotiations between the countries for the U.S. to establish an embassy in the country, Nixon resigned the presidency.258 His successor, Gerald Ford, officially appointed Cooper to the ambassadorship, and he took leave from Covington &amp; Burling to accept it.259 He arrived in East Germany in December 1974 and served as ambassador until October 1976.260261 After returning to the U.S., he resumed his work at Covington &amp; Burling.262 In his last act of public service, he again served as an alternate delegate to the U.N. General Assembly in 1981.263
Kentucky Governor John Y. Brown, Jr., son of Cooper's former opponent in the senatorial elections of 1946 and 1966, awarded Cooper the Governor's Distinguished Service Medallion in 1983.264 Later that year, Senators Walter &quot;Dee&quot; Huddleston of Kentucky and Howard Baker of Tennessee introduced a bill to honor Cooper by renaming the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area to the Cooper National Recreation Area; Kentucky Congressman Hal Rogers sponsored a parallel measure in the House.265 As a senator, Cooper had been instrumental in securing congressional approval for the creation of Big South Fork.266 Opposition to the measure developed in both Kentucky and Tennessee &lt;U+2013&gt; the recreation area spans the two states &lt;U+2013&gt; and the proposal was eventually dropped at Cooper's request.267268
In 1985, Cooper became the third-ever recipient of the Oxford Cup, an award recognizing outstanding past members of Beta Theta Pi.269 Also in 1985, he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Cumberland College (now the University of the Cumberlands) in Williamsburg, Kentucky.270 He was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Centre College in 1987.271 A non-partisan group co-chaired by former Kentucky gubernatorial candidate Larry Forgy raised $60,000 to commission two sculptures of Cooper.272 A life-sized bronze bust of Cooper sculpted by John Tuska was installed at the Kentucky State Capitol in 1987.273274 The other sculpture, a life-sized bronze statue crafted by Barney Bright, was placed in Fountain Square in Somerset.275276
Cooper retired from the practice of law in 1989.277 In June 1990, Cooper was honored with a gala screening of Gentleman From Kentucky, a Kentucky Educational Television documentary about his life, at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C.278 On February 21, 1991, Cooper died of heart failure in retirement home in Washington, D.C.279 He was preceded in death by his second wife, Lorraine, who had died on February 3, 1985.280 On February 26, 1991, Kentucky's two senators &lt;U+2013&gt; Wendell H. Ford and Mitch McConnell &lt;U+2013&gt; gave speeches on the Senate floor praising Cooper, and the Senate adjourned in Cooper's memory.281 Cooper was buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.282
Due to his extensive support of rural electrification as a senator, the East Kentucky RECC was renamed the John Sherman Cooper Power Station in his honor.283 In 1999, the Lexington Herald-Leader named Cooper one of the most influential Kentuckians of the 20th century.284 In 2000, Eastern Kentucky University's Center for Kentucky History and Politics established the annual John Sherman Cooper Award for Outstanding Public Service in Kentucky.285
