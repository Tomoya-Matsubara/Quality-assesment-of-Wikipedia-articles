The American Legion is a social and mutual-aid veterans' organization including members of the United States armed forces. The organization was founded in 1919 by veterans returning from Europe after World War I, and was later chartered as an official American patriotic society under Title 36 of the United States Code. The organization is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, and also has offices in Washington, DC. The group has nearly 3 million members in over 14,000 Posts worldwide.1
In addition to organizing commemorative events and volunteer veteran support activities, the American Legion is active in issue oriented U.S. politics. Its primary political activity is lobbying on behalf of the interests of veterans and service members, including support for veterans benefits such as pensions and the Veterans Affairs hospital system. The Legion has also been involved as a conservative voice in more general political and cultural issues.
History
Background

Theodore &quot;Teddy&quot; Roosevelt, Jr., regarded as the founding father of the American Legion.

The aftermath of two American wars in the second half of the 19th Century had seen the formation of ex-soldiers' organizations &lt;U+2014&gt; the Grand Army of the Republic and the United Confederate Veterans after the American Civil War of 1861-65 and the American Veterans of Foreign Service at the conclusion of the short-lived Spanish-American conflict of 1898.2 With the termination of hostilities in World War I in November 1918, certain American officers who had been participants in the conflict began to think about the creation of a similar organization for the nearly two million men who had shipped out for European duty.3
The need for an organization for former members of the Allied Expeditionary Forces (AEF) was pressing and immediate. With the war at an end, hundreds of thousands of impatient draftees found themselves trapped in France and pining for home, certain only that untold weeks or months lay ahead of them before it would logistics for their return be possible.4 Morale plummeted.5 Cautionary voices were raised about an apparent correlation between disaffected and discharged troops and the Bolshevik uprisings taking place in Russia, Finland, Germany, and Hungary.6
This situation was a particular matter of concern to Lt. Col. Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., eldest son of the 26th President. One day in January 1919 Roosevelt had a discussion at General Headquarters with a mobilized National Guard officer named George A. White, a former newspaper editor with the Portland Oregonian.7 After long discussion, Roosevelt suggested the establishment at once of a new servicemen's organization including all members of the AEF, as well as those soldiers who remained stateside as members of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps during the war without having been shipped abroad.8
Roosevelt and Green advocated ceaselessly for this proposal until ultimately they found sufficient support at headquarters to move forward with the plan. Orders were issued by Gen. John J. Pershing to a group of 20 non-career officers to report to YMCA headquarters in Paris on February 15, 1919.9 The selection of these individuals was handled by Roosevelt.10 Joining them were a number of regular Army officers selected by Pershing himself.11
The session of reserve and regular officers was given the task of providing a set of recommendations aimed at curbing the problem of declining morale.12 A series of proposals resulted from the three days of sessions, including elimination of restrictive regulations, organization of additional athletic events and recreational opportunities, and the expansion of leave time and entertainment programs.13 At the end of the first day, the group retired to the Inter-Allied Officers Club, a converted home located across the street from the YMCA building,14 where Lt. Col. Roosevelt unveiled his proposal for a new veterans' society for the first time.15
Most of those present were rapidly won to Roosevelt's plan.16 The group decided to declare all of their actions provisional until a duly elected convention of delegates could be convened and made no effort to predetermine a program for the still-unnamed veterans organization.17 Instead they sought to expand their number through the convocation of a large preliminary meeting in Paris, to consist of an equal number of elected delegates from the ranks of enlisted men and the officer corps.18
A provisional executive committee of four people emerged from the February 15 &quot;Roosevelt dinner&quot;: Roosevelt in the first place, who was to return to the United States and obtain his military discharge when able, and then to gather assistants and promote the idea of the new veterans' organization among demobilized troops there; George White, who was to travel France touring the camps of the AEF explaining the idea in person; Secretary of the group was veteran wartime administrator Eric Fisher Wood, who together with former Ohio Congressman Ralph D. Cole, was were to establish a central office and to maintain contact by mail and telegram with the various combat divisions and headquarters staffs, as well as to publicize activities to the press.19
Preparations for a convention in Paris began apace. A convention call was prepared by Wood and &quot;invitations&quot; distributed to about 2,000 officers and enlisted men and publicized in the March 14, 1919 issue of Stars and Stripes.20 The convention call expressed the desire to form &quot;one permanent nation-wide organization...composed of all parties, all creeds, and all ranks who wish to perpetuate the relationships formed while in military service.&quot;21 In addition to the personal invitations distributed, the published announcement indicated that &quot;any officer or enlisted man not invited who is in Paris at the time of the meeting is invited to be present and to have a voice in the meeting.&quot;22 The conclave was slated to begin on March 15.
Establishment
The Paris Caucus (March 15-17, 1919) 
Having immediately received a blizzard of acceptances to attend the opening of the &quot;Liberty League Caucus,&quot; as he had begun to refer to it, Temporary Secretary Eric Fisher Wood began to search for use of a room of sufficient size to contain the gathering.23 The Cirque de Paris had been retained, a large, multisided amphitheater sufficient to accommodate a crowd of about 2,000.24 Delegates began to assemble from all over France. The 10:00 am scheduled start was delayed due to various logistical problems, with a beginning finally made shortly after 2:45 pm.25
As &quot;Temporary Chairman&quot; Teddy Roosevelt, Jr. had already departed for America, the session was gaveled to order by Eric Wood, who briefly recounted Roosevelt's idea and the story of the 20 AEF officers who had jointly helped to give the new organization form.26 In his keynote opening remarks Wood recommended to the delegates of the so-called Paris Caucus that they do three things: first, set up an apparatus to conduct a formal founding conference in the United States sometime in the winter; second, the body should draft a tentative name for the organization; and finally, the body should compose a provisional constitution to be submitted to the founding convention for its acceptance or rejection.27
Convention rules were decided upon and four 15-member committees were chosen.28 The Committee on Name reported back that they had considered a dozen potential names, including Veterans of the Great War, Liberty League, American Comrades of the Great War, Legion of the Great War, and the American Legion, among others.29 This list was whittled down to five ranked choices for the consideration of the Caucus, with &quot;The American Legion&quot; the preferred option.30 It was noted in passing during the course of debate on the topic that Teddy Roosevelt, Jr. had been responsible for an earlier organization called &quot;The American Legion&quot; in 1914, a &quot;preparedness&quot; society with a claimed membership of 35,000 which had been absorbed into the Council of National Defense in 1916.31
The Committee on Constitution reported with a report containing the draft of a Preamble for the organization, specifying organizational objectives.32 This document stated that the group

&quot;...desiring to perpetuate the principles of Justice, Freedom, and Democracy for which we have fought, to inculcate the duty and obligation of the citizen to the State; to preserve the history and incidents of our participation in the war; and to cement the ties of comradeship formed in service, do propose to found and establish an Association for the furtherance of the foregoing purposes.&quot;33

The majority report of the Committee on Convention recommended that 11 am on November 11, 1919 &lt;U+2014&gt; one year to the hour after the termination of hostilities in World War I &lt;U+2014&gt; be selected as the date and time for the convocation of a national convention.34 No location was specified.35
The Committee on Permanent Organization recommended an organization based upon territorial units rather than those based upon military organizations, governed by an Executive Committee of 50, with half of these coming from the officer corps and the other half coming from the ranks of enlisted men.36
The Paris Caucus also elected an executive committee to complete their organizational work. The executive committee named a subcommittee to organize veterans in the U.S.
The St. Louis Caucus (May 8-10, 1919)
The Paris Caucus in March was by its nature limited to soldiers of the AEF who remained in Europe; a parallel organizational meeting for those who had returned to the American preparatory to a formal organizational convention was deemed necessary. This was a conclave dominated by the presence of Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., who called the convention to order amidst mass chanting akin to that of a Presidential nominating convention &lt;U+2014&gt; &quot;We Want Ted-dy! We Want Ted-dy!&quot;37
A minor crisis followed when Roosevelt twice declined nomination for permanent chairman of the session, to the consternation of many overwrought delegates, who sought to emphasize the symbolism of President Theodore Roosevelt's son maintaining the closest of connections with the organization.38
The work of the St. Louis Caucus was largely shaped by the fundamental decisions made by the earlier Paris Caucus. Its agenda was in addition carefully prepared by a 49-member &quot;Advance Committee,&quot; which included at least one delegate from each fledgling state organization and which drew up a draft program for the organization in advance of the convention's opening.39
The first post of the American Legion, General John Joseph Pershing Post Number 1 in Washington, D.C., was organized on March 7, 1919, and obtained the first charter issued to any post of the Legion on May 19, 1919. The St. Louis caucus that same year decided that Legion posts should not be named after living persons, and the first post changed its name to George Washington Post 1. The post completed the constitution and made plans for a permanent organization. It set up temporary headquarters in New York City and began its relief, employment, and Americanism programs.
Congress granted the American Legion a national charter in September 1919.
Founding Convention &lt;U+2014&gt; Minneapolis, Minnesota (November 10-12, 1919)
The first national convention of the American Legion was held from November 10&lt;U+2013&gt;12, 1919, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, at which time the attendees adopted a permanent constitution and elected officers to head the organization.
Early violence


See main article: Centralia Massacre (Washington).



In this political cartoon from the Portland Telegram a Legionnaire prepares to hit a ball labeled &quot;Bolshevism&quot; with a rifle butt labeled &quot;100 per cent Americanism&quot; beside a quote from Theodore Roosevelt: &quot;Don't argue with the reds; go to bat with them and go to the bat strong!&quot;

On November 11, 1919, the first anniversary of Armistice Day, a new American Legion group in Washington was involved in the Centralia massacre.
1920s
The American Legion was very active in the 1920s. The organization was formally non-partisan, endorsing candidates of no political party. Instead the group worked to the spread of the ideology of Americanism and acted as an lobbying organization on behalf of issues of importance to veterans, with particular emphasis on winning a &quot;soldier's bonus&quot; payment from the government and for the alleviation of the unemployment to which many soldiers returned.
The Legion also served a strong social function, building and buying &quot;clubhouses&quot; in communities across America at which its members could gather, reflect, network, and socialize.
In 1924, the Legion and other veterans organizations won their battle for additional compensation for World War I veterans with the passage of the World War Adjusted Compensation Act. Most payments were scheduled to be paid in 1945.40
In 1923, American Legion Commander Alvin Owsley cited Italian Fascism as a model for defending the nation against the forces of the left.41 Owsley said:

If ever needed, the American Legion stands ready to protect our country's institutions and ideals as the Fascisti dealt with the destructionists who menaced Italy!...The American Legion is fighting every element that threatens our democratic government &lt;U+2014&gt; Soviets, anarchists, IWW, revolutionary socialists and every other red....Do not forget that the Fascisti are to Italy what the American Legion is to the United States.42

The Legion invited Mussolini to speak at its convention as late as 1930.43
The American Legion was instrumental in the creation of the U.S. Veterans' Bureau, now known as the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Legion also created its own American Legion Baseball Program, hosting national tournaments annually from 1926.
Commander Travers D. Carmen awarded Charles Lindbergh its &quot;Distinguished Service Medal,&quot; the medal's first recipient, on July 22, 1927. American Legion national convention was held in Paris, France in September 1927. A major part of this was drum and bugle corps competition in which approximately 14,000 members took part.
1930s to 1950s
The American Legion Memorial Bridge in Traverse City, Michigan, was completed in 1930.44
The Sons of the American Legion formed at the American Legion's 14th National Convention in Portland, Oregon, on September 12&lt;U+2013&gt;15, 1932. Membership is limited to the male descendants of members of the American Legion, or deceased individuals who served in the armed forces of the United States during times specified by the American Legion.
In the spring of 1933, at the very beginning of his presidency, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt sought to balance the federal budget by sharp reductions in veterans benefits, which constituted one quarter of the federal budget. The Economy Act of 1933 cut disability pensions and established strict new guidelines for proving disabilities. The American Legion generally supported the FDR administration and the Act, while the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) was loudly opposed. After a VFW convention heard speeches denouncing FDR's programs, the American Legion invited Roosevelt to speak and he won the convention's support. Nevertheless, the Legion's stance was unpopular with its membership and membership plummeted in 1933 by 20% as 160,000 failed to renew their memberships. The VFW then campaigned for a &quot;Bonus Bill&quot; that would immediately pay World War I veterans what they were due in 1945 under the 1924 World War Adjusted Compensation Act. The Legion's failure to take a similar position allowed the much smaller, less prestigious VFW to rally support while accusing the Legion of ties to the FDR Administration and business interests. In December 1933, retired General Smedley Butler, a popular and colorful speaker, toured the country on behalf of the VFW, calling on veterans to organize politically to win their benefits.45 Butler believed the American Legion was controlled by banking interests. On December 8, 1933, explaining why he believed veterans' interests were better served by the VFW than the American Legion, he said: &quot;I said I have never known one leader of the American Legion who had never sold them out&lt;U+2013&gt;and I mean it.&quot;46
In November 1934, Butler told the New York Evening Post and a congressional subcommittee that representatives of powerful industrial interests and the American Legion were trying to induce him to lead the Legion in a campaign to preserve the gold standard and to engineer a coup against President Roosevelt with Butler's aid in marshaling the support of veterans. Everyone implicated denied involvement and the press gave the story little credence. Nevertheless, Butler's charges, elaborated by articles in the Communist newspaper New Masses, gave birth to an enduring conspiracy theory, known as the Business Plot, that powerful business interests in alliance with the Legion planned to overthrow the federal government.47
In 1935, the first Boys' State convened in Springfield, Illinois. The American Legion's first National High School Oratorical Contest was held in 1938.
In 1942, the Legion adopted the practice of the VFW to become a perpetual organization, rather than die off as its membership aged as that of the Grand Army of the Republic was rapidly doing. The Legion's charter was changed to allow veterans of World War II to join. Throughout the 1940s, the American Legion was active in providing support for veterans and soldiers who fought in World War II. The American Legion wrote the original draft of the Veterans Readjustment Act, which became known as the G.I. Bill. The original draft is preserved at the Legion's National Headquarters. The American Legion vigorously campaigned for the G.I. Bill, which was signed into law in June 1944.
The first Boys Nation program was held in 1946.
At the Legion's 1951 convention at Miami, Florida, it formally endorsed its &quot;Back to God&quot; movement.48 When launching the program in 1953 with a national television broadcast that included speeches by President Eisenhower and Vice-President Nixon, the Legion's National Commander Lewis K. Gough said it promoted &quot;regular church attendance, daily family prayer, and the religious training of children.&quot;49
In 1952, the American Legion asked for a congressional investigation into the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to determine if it was a communist or communist front organization.50
Veterans of the Korean War were approved for membership in the American Legion in 1950, and the American Legion Child Welfare Foundation was formed in 1954.
1960s to 1990s
 
On May 30, 1969, the Cabin John Bridge, which carried the Capital Beltway (I-495) across the Potomac River northwest of Washington, D.C., was officially renamed to the &quot;American Legion Memorial Bridge&quot; in a ceremony led by Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, director of the U.S. Selective Service System.51
In 1976, an outbreak of bacterial pneumonia occurred in a convention of the American Legion at The Bellevue Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia. This pneumonia killed 34 people at the convention and later became known as Legionnaires' disease (Legionellosis). The bacterium that causes the illness was later named Legionella.
After a 1989 U.S. Supreme Court decision, the American Legion launched and funded an unsuccessful campaign to win a constitutional amendment against harming the flag of the United States. The Legion formed the Citizens' Flag Honor Guard and it later became the Citizens Flag Alliance.52
1990s to present
In 1993, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts renamed a bridge in the city of Chicopee to the &quot;American Legion Memorial Bridge&quot;.53
Also in 1993, two members of Garden City, Michigan American Legion Post 396 shared an idea that would bond motorcycle enthusiasts in the Legion from the idea of Chuck Dare and post commander Bill Kaledas, creating the American Legion Riders. Joined by 19 other founding members, the group soon found itself inundated with requests for information about the new group. As a source of information a website was set up, and it continues to be a source of information worldwide. By 2009, the American Legion Riders program had grown to over 1,000 chapters and 100,000 members in the United States and overseas.
In a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton in May 1999, the American Legion urged the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Operation Allied Force in Yugoslavia. The National Executive Committee of The American Legion met and adopted a resolution unanimously that stated, in part, that they would only support military operations if &quot;Guidelines be established for the mission, including a clear exit strategy&quot; and &quot;That there be support of the mission by the U.S. Congress and the American people.&quot;54
In 2006, the Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Steve Buyer (R-Ind.), announced that he planned to eliminate the annual congressional hearings for Veterans Service Organizations that was established by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In response, National Commander of the American Legion Thomas L. Bock said, &quot;I am extremely disappointed in Chairman Buyer's latest effort to ignore the Veterans Service Organizations. Eliminating annual hearings before a joint session of the Veterans Affairs Committees will lead to continued budgetary shortfalls for VA resulting in veterans being underserved.&quot;55
According to the American Legion, the ACLU, has used the threat of attorney fees to intimidate cities, counties, school boards and other locally elected bodies into surrendering to its demands to remove religion from the public square.56 As such the American Legion states that it &quot;is leading a nationwide effort to combat the secular cleansing of our American heritage,&quot;57 stating that the phrase &quot;separation of church and state&quot; is nowhere mentioned in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.58 The American Legion released a document titled &quot;In The Footsteps Of The Founders &lt;U+2013&gt; A Guide To Defending American Values&quot; to be available to the citizens of The United States of America.59 The veteran's organization has done this to curtail religious-establishment cases against the Boy Scouts, the public display of the Ten Commandments and other symbols pertaining to America's religious history and heritage.60
Official publications
 The organization's official publication in its initial phase was a magazine called The American Legion Weekly, launched on July 4, 1919.61 This publication switched its frequency and renamed itself The American Legion Monthly in 1926.62 In 1936 the publication's name and volume numbering system changed again, this time to American Legion Magazine.63

Organizational structure
Posts
The Post is the basic unit of the Legion and usually represents a small geographic area such as a single town or part of a county. There are roughly 14,900 posts in the United States. The Post is used for formal business such as meetings and a coordination point for community service projects. Often the Post will host community events such as bingo, Hunter breakfasts, holiday celebrations, and available to the community, churches in time of need. It is also not uncommon for the Post to contain a bar open during limited hours. A Post member is distinguished by a navy blue garrison cap with gold piping.
Counties
Each U.S. county comprises several Posts and oversees their operations, led by a County Council of elected officers. The County Commander performs annual inspections of the Posts within their jurisdiction and reports the findings to both the District and the Department level. A County Commander is distinguished by a navy blue garrison cap with white piping.
Districts
Each Department is divided into Divisions and/or Districts. Each District oversees several Posts, generally about 20, to help each smaller group have a larger voice. Divisions are even larger groups of about four or more Districts. The main purpose of these &quot;larger&quot; groups (Districts &lt;U+2014&gt; Divisions) are to allow one or two delegates to represent an area at conferences, conventions, and other gatherings, where large numbers of Legionnaires may not be able to attend. A District Commander is distinguished by a navy blue garrison cap with a white crown and gold piping.
Departments

American Legion Headquarters in Indianapolis

The Posts are grouped together into a state level organization known as a Department for the purposes of coordination and administration. There is a total of 55 Departments; one for each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, France, Mexico, and the Philippines. Canada was merged into Department of New York several years ago. The three Departments located overseas are intended to allow active duty military stationed and veterans living overseas to be actively involved with the American Legion similar to as if they were back in the states. The Department of France consists of 29 Posts located in 10 European counties, the Department of Mexico consists of 22 Posts located in Central America, and the Department of Philippines covers Asia and the Pacific Islands. A Department Officer or Department Executive Committee Representative is distinguished by a white garrison cap with gold piping.
National headquarters
The main American Legion Headquarters is located on the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza in Indianapolis. It is the primary office for the National Commander and also houses the historical archives, library, Membership, Internal Affairs, Public Relations, and the Magazine editorial offices.65 The Legion also owns a building in Washington D.C. that contains many of the operation offices such as Economics, Legislative, Veterans Affairs, Foreign Relations, National Security, and Media Relations, and etc. A National Officer or National Executive Committee Representative is distinguished by a red garrison cap with gold piping.
