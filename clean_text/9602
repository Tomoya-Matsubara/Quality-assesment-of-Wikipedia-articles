Jon Andreas N&lt;U+00F6&gt;dtveidt (28 June 1975 &lt;U+2013&gt; 13 August 20061) was a lead guitarist and vocalist of the Swedish black metal band Dissection, which he founded in 1989.
N&lt;U+00F6&gt;dtveidt also performed in several other projects, including The Black (as Rietas), De Infernali, Nifelheim, Ophthalamia (as Shadow), Satanized, Siren's Yell, and Terror, a grindcore band which featured members of At the Gates.
He also appeared as a journalist in Metal Zone, where he was responsible for keeping track of the growing black metal scene.
He was a member of the Misanthropic Luciferian Order, now known as Temple of the Black Light, and the Werewolf Legion, a Swedish gang, not to be confused with the Russian Werewolf Legion. Contrary to popular belief, he was not its co-creator, but &quot;was introduced [...] by close friends at a quite early stage.&quot;2
N&lt;U+00F6&gt;dtveidt was convicted of being an accessory to the 1997 murder of a gay Algerian man called Josef Ben Meddour.3 He was released from prison in 2004, and restarted Dissection.
Death
On the 16th of August 2006, he was found dead in his apartment in H&lt;U+00E4&gt;sselby, a suburb of Stockholm by an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound inside a circle of lit candles.4
Early reports indicated that he was found with an open copy of the Satanic Bible, but these were later dismissed by Dissection's guitarist Set Teitan. According to him, &quot;it's not any atheist, humanist and ego-worshiping 'Satanic Bible' by Anton LaVey that Jon had in front of him, but a Satanic Grimoire. He despised LaVey and 'The Church of Satan'.&quot;5
The said &quot;Satanic Grimoire&quot; is reputed to be the Liber Azerate, one of the publishings of the Misanthropic Luciferian Order, from which Jon N&lt;U+00F6&gt;dtveidt apparently was influenced, his last album Reinkaos's lyrics being co-written by the very same man who wrote the Liber Azerate.
On 19 August 2006, Jon's website publicly announced his suicide.
N&lt;U+00F6&gt;dtvedit's brother, Emil &quot;Nightmare Industries&quot; N&lt;U+00F6&gt;dtveidt, the rhythm guitarist and keyboardist of gothic industrial metal band Deathstars, wrote a song named &quot;Via the End&quot; the night he heard about N&lt;U+00F6&gt;dtveidt's suicide. The song appears as the fifth track on Deathstar's third album Night Electric Night.
Regarding his views on suicide, N&lt;U+00F6&gt;dtveidt said &lt;U+200E&gt;&quot;The Satanist decides of his own life and death and prefers to go out with a smile on his lips when he has reached his peak in life, when he has accomplished everything, and aim to transcend this earthly existence. But it is completely un-satanic to end ones own life because one is sad or miserable. The Satanist dies strong, not by age, disease or depression, and he chooses death before dishonor! Death is the orgasm of life! So live life accordingly, as intense as possible!&quot;6
