Marshall M. Criser, Jr. (born September 4, 1928) is an American corporate lawyer and university administrator. Criser is a native of New Jersey, and earned his bachelor's and law degrees before becoming a practicing attorney. He was the eighth president of the University of Florida located in Gainesville, Florida, serving from 1984 to 1989.
Early life and education
Criser was the University of Florida's second alumnus to serve as its president.12 He earned his way through undergraduate school at Florida as a cafeteria cashier and construction worker, while remaining an active member of Sigma Nu Fraternity (Epsilon Zeta chapter) and student government, and served as president of Florida Blue Key leadership honorary.3 He was also inducted into the UF Hall of Fame.4 Criser graduated from the university's College of Business Administration in 1949 and College of Law in 1951.5 After graduation from law school, he served as a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army for two years of active duty before entering the private practice of law in Palm Beach County, Florida.6
Lawyer, regent and university president
Before becoming the University of Florida's president, Criser was a 31-year partner in the law firm of Gunster, Yoakley, Criser &amp; Stewart in West Palm Beach, Florida, and served as a member of the board of governors of The Florida Bar from 1960 to 1969 and as its president from 1968 to 1969.7 He was also a two-term member of the Board of Regents of the State University System of Florida, having been appointed by Governor Farris Bryant in 1965, reappointed by Governor Reubin Askew in 1971, and served as the chairman of the Board of Regents for four years.8 As chairman, Criser led the search committee that selected Robert Q. Marston as university president in 1974.9
Criser's term as president is remembered for the enhancement of the university's instructional quality, the rapid rise of its admission standards, the growth of its academic reputation, and its successful fund-raising among alumni and the business community.10 His administration successfully completed the process of the University of Florida's admission to the Association of American Universities (AAU), the leading association of North American research universities, in 1985,11 and forthrightly handled the football program's widespread violations of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules under coach Charley Pell that shocked the university community during the 1984&lt;U+2013&gt;1985 academic year.12 Criser was responsible for initiating the university's first comprehensive capital campaign in the fall of 1988.13 When completed three years later, in 1991, the capital campaign had raised more than $390 million dollars for the university's endowment.14 At the time, the capital campaign was the third-highest fund-raising campaign ever conducted by a state university.15

Criser advocated reducing class sizes to improve the quality of academic instruction, and proposed reducing the undergraduate student body by 1,500 students while maintaining the university faculty and budget.16 The next three freshman classes were to be reduced by 500 entering students each.17 He also made plans for raising the university's admissions standards and its upper division retention requirements, bolstering the academic counseling program, and rewarding faculty excellence in instruction, research and academic publishing.18 The lost income from the smaller entering classes, and the costs of the other academic enhancements, were to be offset by increased investment income resulting from the capital campaign's additions to the university endowment.19
After resigning as the university president in 1989, Criser returned to the practice of law in Jacksonville, Florida, with the law firm of Mahoney, Adams &amp; Criser,20 and its successor, McGuire Woods.21 When the Florida Legislature reorganized the governance system for the state's universities in 2001, Governor Jeb Bush appointed Criser as the founding chairman of the newly constituted board of trustees of the university. He served on the board of directors of Barnett Bank, BellSouth, Florida Power &amp; Light and Rinker Materials, and, at the request of Governor Bush, he later served as the chairman of Scripps Florida Funding Corp.22 He also served as a member of the NCAA Infractions Appeals Committee.23
