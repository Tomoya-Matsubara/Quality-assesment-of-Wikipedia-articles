The Fragile is the second album by the folk music duo O'Hooley &amp; Tidow, featuring guest performances by Andy Cutting, Jackie Oates, Jude Abbott, Cormac Byrne, Anna Esslemont, Sam Pegg, The Solo Players and London&lt;U+2019&gt;s Diversity Choir. It was released on 9 February 2012 on the No Masters label. The title is derived from the words of one of the tracks on the album, &quot;Mein Deern&quot;, a song about the dying hours of Heidi Tidow's German grandmother.1 According to O'Hooley &amp; Tidow, all the songs are linked by the common theme of vulnerability.2
A single from the album, &quot;The Last Polar Bear&quot;, was released in November 2011.3 The track was reissued on 1 November 2012 as a double single with &quot;Gentleman Jack&quot;.4 This is a song, also from the album, about Anne Lister, an early 19th century Yorkshire lesbian gentlewoman.5
Production
Mixed and mastered by Neil Ferguson of Chumbawamba, the album was recorded at Belinda O'Hooley and Heidi Tidow's home in Golcar in September and October 2011.
Reception
Robin Denselow of The Guardian described The Fragile as an &quot;intriguing, ambitious set&quot; and said that the album's cover version of Massive Attack's &quot;Teardrop&quot; was &quot;an exquisite reworking&quot;.6 Guardian music critic Jude Rogers voted it as one of the best tracks of 2012.7
Spiral Earth's reviewer said that The Fragile was an &quot;incredibly moving, deep and finely nuanced album&quot;.8Northern Sky praised the album's &quot;complex string arrangements and fine instrumental accompaniment&quot; and &quot;highly accomplished pieces of musical composition; you can never second guess what's around the corner in terms of sonic exploration&quot;.9 Reviewing the album for Folking.com, Dai Jeffries said &quot;The confidence, power and earthiness of their voices both solo and in harmony are what shine through this excellent album.10 Folk Wales Online described the album as &quot;breathtakingly original&quot;.11
Northern Sky music magazine's reviewer described the song &quot;The Last Polar Bear&quot; as &quot;utterly beautiful&quot;, saying &quot;This is how love songs should be written.&quot;12
