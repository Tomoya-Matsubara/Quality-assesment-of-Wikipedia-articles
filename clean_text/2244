The Gay Nigger Association of America (often referred to as the GNAA) is an anti-blogging Internet trolling organization that aims to disrupt the Internet. They take their name from the 1992 Danish movie Gayniggers from Outer Space, and do not promote racism or homophobia. They have trolled several prominent websites and Internet commentators, including members of blogging culture, Slashdot, Wikipedia, and CNN. They have also released software products and leaked information about operating systems. In addition, they maintain a wiki-based site dedicated to Internet commentary in a style parodying Slashdot posts and offer a Subversion-based software repository containing various GNAA coding projects.
Members of the GNAA also founded Goatse Security, a white hat information security group. Members of Goatse Security released information in June 2010 about a vulnerability located on AT&amp;T's website that notably affected the privacy of people who pre-ordered the iPad. After the information was released, the then-president of the GNAA, weev, and GNAA member &quot;JacksonBrown&quot; were arrested.
Origins and purpose
The group claims to have been founded in 2002.1 Little is known about the group's structure. New media researcher Andrew Lih has claimed that it is unclear whether there was initially a clearly defined group of GNAA members, or if founding members of the GNAA were online troublemakers united under the name in order to disrupt websites.2 However, an article on Boing Boing notes that the group is often perceived to be a very unified tightly-knit organization.3 The group's name has been controversial. According to Lih it causes &quot;immediate alarm in anyone with a semblance of good taste,&quot; and an article in The Scotsman characterized it as &quot;spectacularly offensive.&quot; However, the group claims that it promotes neither racism nor homophobia. The name &quot;Gay Nigger Association of America&quot; is often perceived as racist and offensive, mainly because of the word &quot;nigger.&quot; GNAA members deny allegations of actual racism, implying that these statements are made only to elicit angry responses and to subvert or otherwise challenge long-standing social norms, and note that the name of the organization came from the 1992 Danish satirical blaxploitation film Gayniggers from Outer Space.4
The group's aim is to sow disruption on the Internet. They are particularly antagonistic towards blogs,5 but have also aimed to disrupt online communities such as Wikipedia. On Wikipedia the group has adhered to every rule in order to use the site's system against itself.6 Though they have disrupted online communities, the group does not organize denial of service attacks.7
Several members of the GNAA with expertise in white hat8 security research began releasing information about security vulnerabilities under the name &quot;Goatse Security.&quot; They chose a new name to publish their work under because they were worried that their work would not get noticed if published by the &quot;Gay Nigger Association of America.&quot;9
Trolling
Members of the GNAA have engaged in a variety of types of trolling. One tactic is flooding weblogs with a massive amount of repeated words and phrases, sometimes referred to as &quot;crapflooding.&quot;1011 They have also produced shock sites and used links to redirect Internet users to the sites.12 One such site, &quot;Last Measure,&quot; contained malware that opened up pop-up windows containing shocking pictures.13 On Wikipedia, members of the group created pages with a controversial and offensive names, in order to shock community members.14
They have also participated in IRC channel disruption. They have used obscure methods to force IRC users to execute commands after visiting websites containing malware.15 They also have used bugs in Firefox to crapflood IRC channels.16 They have also performed proof of concept demonstrations.1718 These actions have occasionally interrupted the normal operation of popular websites such as Slashdot, even forcing some websites (such as 4chan) to shut down temporarily.19 As such, targeted communities generally consider GNAA crapfloods to be a serious matter and frequently respond with technological and social anti-trolling measures such as moderation systems to limit future disruption.20
In July 2004, two GNAA members submitted leaked screenshots of the forthcoming operating system Mac OS X v10.4 to the popular Apple Macintosh news website MacRumors, which read &quot;With WWDC just days away, the first Tiger information and screenshots appears to have been leaked. According to sources, Apple will reportedly provide developers with a Mac OS X 10.4 preview copy at WWDC on Monday. The screenshots provided reportedly come from this upcoming developer preview.&quot;21 Later, when accusations were raised that the images were fabricated, the GNAA released a press release which claimed that the screenshots were genuine and stated that they had &quot;trolled&quot; the Apple community.22
In June 2005, the GNAA claimed to have created a Mac OS X Tiger release for Intel x86 processors which caught media attention from various sources.232425 The next day, the supposed leak and was mentioned on the G4 show Attack of the Show.26 The DVD image released via BitTorrent merely booted an image of hello.jpg27 instead of the leaked operating system as many were led to believe.28 and the remaining gigabytes of space on the DVD were filled with a repetition of the text &quot;GNAAGNAA...&quot;
On February 3, 2007, the GNAA successfully convinced CNN reporter Paula Zahn that &quot;one in three Americans&quot; believe the September 11, 2001 terror attacks were carried out by Israeli agents.29 CNN subsequently ran a story, erroneously reporting this, including screenshots of the GNAA-owned website &quot;jewsdidwtc.com.&quot; The story involved a round-table discussion regarding antisemitism and an interview with the father of a Jewish 9/11 victim.30 The GNAA-owned website included claims that &quot;over 4,000&quot; Jews were absent from work at the World Trade Center on 9/11.31
Goatse Security
  In June 2010, Goatse Security attracted mainstream media attention for their disclosure of 114,000 email addresses32 registered to Apple iPad devices for early adopters of Apple's 3G iPad service.3334 The data was aggregated from AT&amp;T's own servers by feeding a publicly available script with HTTP requests containing randomly generated ICC-IDs, which would then return the associated email address. The FBI soon investigated the incident. This investigation led to the arrest of then-GNAA President,35 Andrew 'weev' Auernheimer, on unrelated drug charges resulting from an FBI search of his house.3637 Auernheimer and fellow GNAA member Daniel Spitler (also known as &quot;JacksonBrown&quot;) were also mentioned in connection with the hack. A spokesman for Goatse Security expressed outrage over Auernheimer's arrest, stating:
