SMS Kronprinz His Majesty's Ship Crown Prince was the last battleship of the four-ship sclass Knig battleship 4. She served in the German Imperial Navy during World War I. The battleship was laid down in November 1911 and launched on 21 February 1914. She was formally commissioned into the Imperial Navy on 8 November 1914, just over 4 months after the start of World War I. In June 1918, the ship was renamed Kronprinz Wilhelm in honor of William, German Crown Prince Crown Prince Wilhelm. The battleship was armed with ten convert 30.5 cm in sp=us adj=on guns in five twin turrets and could steam at a top speed of convert 21 kn link=on.

Along with her three sister ships, SMS Knig  2, SMS Grosser Kurfrst 1913 2 or GroerThis is the German sharp S; see . Kurfrst, and SMS Markgraf  2, Kronprinz took part in most of the fleet actions during the war, including the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916. Although near the front of the German line, she emerged from the battle unscathed. She was torpedoed by the British submarine HMS J1 on 5 November 1916 during an operation off the Danish coast. Following repairs, she participated in Operation Albion, an amphibious assault in the Baltic Sea Baltic, in October 1917. During the operation Kronprinz engaged the Russian battleship Tsesarevich Russian battleship Tsarevitch and forced her to retreat.

After Germany's defeat in the war and the signing of the Armistice with Germany Armistice in November 1918, Kronprinz and most of the capital ships of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the Royal Navy in Scapa Flow. The ships were disarmed and reduced to skeleton crews while the Allies of World War I Allied powers negotiated the final version of the Treaty of Versailles. On 21 June 1919, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships. Unlike most of the other scuttled ships, Kronprinz was never raised for scrapping; the wreck is still sitting on the bottom of the bay.

Kronprinz was ordered under the provisional name Ersatz Brandenburg and built at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel under construction number 182.Grner, p. 27#tag:ref German warships were ordered under provisional names. For new additions to the fleet, they were given a single letter; for those ships intended to replace older or lost vessels, they were ordered as Ersatz name of the ship to be replaced. group=Note Her keel was laid in May 1912 and she was launched on 21 February 1914.Campbell, John, Germany 19061922, in Sturton, p. 36 The ship was scheduled to be completed in early 1915, but work was expedited after the outbreak of World War I in mid-1914.Staff, p. 36 Fitting-out work was completed by 8 November 1914, the day she was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet.Grner, p. 28 She had cost the Imperial German Government 45 million German gold mark Goldmarks.

Kronprinz displaced convert 25796 t ST abbr=on as built and convert 28600 t ST abbr=on fully loaded, with a length of convert 175.4 m ft abbr=on, a beam of convert 19.5 m ft abbr=on and a draft of convert 9.19 m ft abbr=on. She was powered by three Parsons steam turbines and three oil-fired and twelve coal-fired boilers, which developed a total of 43,300&nbsp;hp 32.3&nbsp;MW and yielded a maximum speed of convert 21 kn km/h abbr=on.

She was armed with ten 30.5 cm SK L/50 gun 30.5&nbsp;cm guns arranged in five twin gun turrets: two superfire superfiring turrets each fore and aft and one turret amidships between the two funnels. Her secondary armament consisted of fourteen 15&nbsp;cm 5.9&nbsp;in guns, six convert 8.8 cm in abbr=on guns and five convert 50 cm in abbr=on underwater torpedo tubes, one in the bow and two on each beam.

Service history
Kronprinz was completed in November 1914; following her commissioning she joined the III Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet.Preston, p.  80 Kronprinz completed her sea trials on 2 January 1915. The first operation in which she participated was an uneventful sortie by the fleet into the North Sea on 2930 March. Three weeks later, on 1718 April, she and her sisters supported an operation in which the light cruisers of the II&nbsp;Scouting Group laid naval mine mines off the Swarte Bank. Another sweep by the fleet occurred on 22 April; two days later III&nbsp;Squadron returned to the Baltic for another round of exercises.Staff, p. 29 On 8 May an explosion occurred in the center turret's right gun. The Baltic exercises lasted until 13 May, at which point the III Squadron returned to the North Sea. Another minelaying operation was conducted by the II&nbsp;Scouting Group on 17 May, with the battleship again in support.

Kronprinz participated in a fleet operation into the North Sea which ended without combat from 29 until 31 May 1915. The ship supported a minelaying operation on 1112 September off Texel. The fleet conducted another sweep into the North Sea on 2324 October. Several uneventful sorties followed on 57 March 1916, 31 March and 23 April. Kronprinz supported Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft a raid on the English coast on 24 April 1916 conducted by the German battlecruiser force of the I&nbsp;Scouting Group. The battlecruisers left the Jade Estuary at 10:55&nbsp;Central European Time CET,The Germans were on Central European Time, which is one hour ahead of Coordinated Universal Time UTC, the time zone commonly used in British works. and the rest of the High Seas Fleet followed at 13:40. The battlecruiser SMS Seydlitz  2 struck a mine while en route to the target, and had to withdraw.Tarrant, p. 53 The other battlecruisers bombarded the town of Lowestoft unopposed, but during the approach to Yarmouth, they encountered the British cruisers of the Harwich Force. A short gun duel ensued before the Harwich Force withdrew. Reports of British submarines in the area prompted the retreat of the I&nbsp;Scouting Group. At this point, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who had been warned of the sortie of the Grand Fleet from its base in Scapa Flow, also withdrew to safer German waters.Tarrant, p. 54

Battle of Jutland
Main Battle of Jutland

Kronprinz was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the battle of Jutland which took place on 31 May and 1 June 1916. The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate. Kronprinz was the rearmost ship of the V&nbsp;Division of the III&nbsp;Battle Squadron, the wikt:vanguard vanguard of the fleet. She followed her sisters Knig, the lead ship, Grosser Kurfrst, and Markgraf. The III&nbsp;Battle Squadron was the first of three battleship units; directly astern were the Sclass Kaiser battleship 1s of the VI&nbsp;Division, III&nbsp;Battle Squadron. Directly astern of the Kaiser class ships were the sclass Helgoland battleship 5 and sclass Nassau battleship 5 classes of the II&nbsp;Battle Squadron; in the rear guard were the obsolescent sclass Deutschland battleship 5 class pre-dreadnoughts of the I&nbsp;Battle Squadron.Tarrant, p. 286

Shortly before 16:00, the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of HMS Indefatigable 1909 2, shortly after 17:00,Tarrant, pp. 9495 and HMS Queen Mary  2, less than half an hour later.Tarrant, pp. 100101 By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, Knig's crew spotted both the I&nbsp;Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a Boxing the compass two-point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers, and a minute later, the order to open fire was given.Tarrant, p. 110The compass can be divided into 32 points, each corresponding to 11.25 degrees. A two-point turn to port would alter the ships' course by 22.5 degrees.

Kronprinz's sisters opened fire on the British battlecruisers, but Kronprinz was not close enough to engage them. Instead, she and ten other German battleships fired at the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron.Campbell, p. 54 Kronprinz fired at HMS Dublin 1912 6 from 17:51 to 18:00 at ranges of convert 17000 - 18600 m abbr=on, then shifted her fire to the fast battleship HMS Malaya  2 at 18:08 at a range of 17,000&nbsp;m. Kronprinz fired first with semi-armor-piercing shells to find the range to her target, then with standard armor-piercing shells.  By the time Malaya drew out of range 13 minutes later, only one hit had been reported by Kronprinz's gunners.  According to naval historian John Campbell, however, this hit was more likely the flash of the Malaya's guns seen through haze and smoke.Campbell, p. 99 During this period, several salvos fell close to Kronprinz, though none struck her.Campbell, p. 100 Kronprinz again reached a firing position against Malaya at 18:30, but was only able to fire for six minutes before the British ship again pulled away.Campbell, p. 104

Shortly after 19:00, several British destroyers attempted a torpedo attack against the leading ships of the German line. The destroyer HMS Onslow 1916 2 fired a pair of torpedoes at Kronprinz at a range of convert 7300 m abbr=on, though both missed.Campbell, pp. 116117 The German cruiser SMS Wiesbaden  2 had been disabled by a shell from the British battlecruiser HMS Invincible 1908 2, and Rear Admiral Paul Behncke in Knig ordered his four ships to maneuver to cover the stricken cruiser.Tarrant, p. 137 Simultaneously, the British III and IV&nbsp;Light Cruiser Squadrons began a torpedo attack on the German line; while advancing to torpedo range, they smothered Wiesbaden with fire from their main guns. Kronprinz and her sisters fired heavily on the British cruisers, but failed to drive them off.Tarrant, p. 138 In the ensuing melee, the British armored cruiser HMS Defence 1907 2 was struck by several heavy caliber shells from the German dreadnoughts. One salvo penetrated the ship's ammunition magazines and, in a massive explosion, destroyed the cruiser.Tarrant, p. 140 John Campbell notes that although Defence's destruction is usually attributed to the battlecruiser SMS Ltzow  2, there is a possibility that it was Kronprinz's fire that destroyed the ship.Campbell, p. 181 After the destruction of Defence, Kronprinz shifted her fire to HMS Warrior 1905 2; the British cruiser was badly damaged and forced to withdraw from the battle. She was unable to reach port, however, and was abandoned the following morning.Campbell, p. 153

By 20:00, the German line was ordered to turn eastward to disengage from the British fleet.Tarrant, p. 169 Markgraf, directly ahead of Kronprinz, had engine problems and fell out of formation, then fell in behind Kronprinz.Campbell, p. 201 Between 20:00 and 20:30, Kronprinz and the other III Squadron battleships engaged the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron as well as the battleships of the Grand Fleet. Kronprinz attempted to find the range by observing the British muzzle flashes, but the worsening visibility prevented her gunners from acquiring a target. As a result, she held her fire in this period.Campbell, pp. 204205 Kronprinz was violently shaken by several near misses, however.Campbell, p. 206 At 20:18, Scheer ordered the fleet to turn away a third time to escape from the murderous British gunfire; this turn reversed the order of the fleet and placed Kronprinz toward the end of the line.Tarrant, pp. 172174 After successfully withdrawing from the British, Scheer ordered the fleet to assume night cruising formation, though communication errors between Scheer aboard SMS Friedrich der Grosse 1911 2 and SMS Westfalen  2, the lead ship, caused delays. The fleet fell into formation by 23:30, with Kronprinz the 14th vessel in the line of 24 capital ships.Campbell, p. 275

Around 02:45, several British destroyers mounted a torpedo attack against the rear half of the German line; Kronprinz spotted several unidentified destroyers in the darkness. Kronprinz held her fire, and she and the other battleships turned away to avoid torpedoes.Campbell, pp. 298299 One torpedo, fired by the destroyer HMS Obedient 1916 2, exploded about convert 100 yd m abbr=on behind Kronprinz, in the battleship's wake. Both Obedient and HMS Faulknor 1914 2 reported a hit on Kronprinz, though she was undamaged by the near miss.Campbell, p. 299 Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw.Campbell, pp. 300301 The High Seas Fleet had managed to punch through the British light forces and subsequently reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1&nbsp;June,Tarrant, pp. 2467 and Wilhelmshaven a few hours later. The I Squadron battleships took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead, while Kronprinz, SMS Kaiser 1911 2, SMS Kaiserin  2, and SMS Prinzregent Luitpold  2 stood ready just outside the entrance to Wilhelmshaven.Campbell, p. 320

In the course of the battle, Kronprinz had fired 144 armor-piercing and semi-armor-piercing rounds from her main battery guns,Campbell, p. 348 though the exact numbers of each are unknown.Campbell, p. 349 The ship did not fire her secondary 15&nbsp;cm or 8.8&nbsp;cm guns during the entire engagement.Campbell, p. 359 Of the four Knig-class ships, only Kronprinz escaped damage during the battle.Campbell, p. 352

Subsequent operations
On 18 August 1916, Kronprinz took part in an operation to bombard Sunderland, Tyne and Wear Sunderland. Admiral Scheer attempted a repeat of the original 31 May plan; the two serviceable German battlecruisersSMS Moltke 1910 2 and SMS Von der Tann  2supported by three dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including Kronprinz, would trail behind and provide cover.Massie, p. 682 The British were aware of the German plans and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them. By 14:35, Admiral Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just eleven weeks after the decidedly close call at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.Massie, p. 683

Kronprinz participated in two uneventful fleet operations, one a month prior on 16 July to the north of Helgoland, and one into the North Sea on 1820 October. Kronprinz and the rest of III Squadron were sent to the Baltic directly afterward for training, which lasted until 2 November.Staff, pp. 3637 Upon returning from the Baltic, Kronprinz and the rest of III Squadron were ordered to cover the retrieval of a pair of U-boats that were stranded on the Danish coast. On the return trip, on 5 November 1916, Kronprinz was torpedoed by the British submarine HMS J1  2 near Horns Reef. The torpedo struck the ship beneath the forward-most gun turret and allowed approximately convert 250 MT sp=us of water into the ship. Kronprinz maintained her speed and reached port. The following day she was placed in drydock at the Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven for repairs, which lasted until 4 December.Staff, p. 37

After returning to the III Squadron, Kronprinz took part in squadron training in the Baltic before conducting defensive patrols in the German Bight. During training maneuvers on 5 March 1917, Kronprinz was accidentally rammed by her sister ship SMS Grosser Kurfrst 1913 2 in the Heligoland Bight. The collision caused minor flooding; Kronprinz shipped some convert 600 MT abbr=on of water. She again went into the drydock in Wilhelmshaven, from 6 March to 17 May. On 11 September, Kronprinz was detached for training in the Baltic. She then joined the Special Unit for Operation Albion.

Operation Albion
Main Operation Albion

In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of Riga, the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the Gulf of Riga. The Admiralstab the Navy High Command planned an operation to seize the Baltic island of Saaremaa sel, and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the Srve Peninsula Sworbe Peninsula.Halpern, p. 213 On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture sel and Muhu Moon Islands; the primary naval component was to comprise the flagship, Moltke, along with the III&nbsp;Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. The V&nbsp;Division included the four Knig-class ships, and was by this time augmented with the new battleship Bayern. The VI&nbsp;Division consisted of the five Kaiser-class battleships. Along with nine light cruisers, three torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of naval mine mine warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, supported by over 100 aircraft and six zeppelins. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men.Halpern, pp. 214215 Opposing the Germans were the old Russian pre-dreadnoughts Russian battleship Slava Slava and Russian battleship Tsesarevich Tsarevitch, the armored cruisers Bayan, Admiral Makarov, and Diana, 26 destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. The garrison on sel numbered some 14,000 men.Halpern, p. 215

The operation began on 12 October; at 03:00 Knig anchored off sel in Tagga Bay and disembarked soldiers. By 05:50, Knig opened fire on Russian coastal artillery emplacements,Staff, p. 31 joined by Moltke, Bayern, and the other three Knig-class ships. Simultaneously, the Kaiser-class ships engaged the batteries on the Sworbe peninsula; the objective was to secure the channel between Moon and Hiiumaa Dag islands, which would block the only escape route of the Russian ships in the Gulf. Both Grosser Kurfrst and Bayern struck mines while maneuvering into their bombardment positions, with minimal damage to the former. Bayern was severely damaged, and had to be withdrawn to Kiel for repairs. After the bombardment, Kronprinz departed the area for Putziger Wiek, where she refueled. The ship passed through Irben Strait on 16 October.

On 16 October, it was decided to detach a portion of the invasion flotilla to clear the Russian naval forces in Moon Sound; these included the two Russian pre-dreadnoughts. To this end, Kronprinz and Knig, along with the cruisers SMS Strassburg  2 and SMS Kolberg  2 and a number of smaller vessels, were sent to engage the Russian battleships. They arrived by the morning of 17 October, but a deep Russian minefield thwarted their progress. The Germans were surprised to discover that the 30.5&nbsp;cm guns of the Russian battleships out-ranged their own 30.5&nbsp;cm guns.#tag:ref The Russian ships had had their main battery turrets modified to allow elevation of the guns to 30. This was much greater than the elevation of the German guns.Halpern, p. 218 group=Note The Russian ships managed to keep the range long enough to prevent the German battleships from being able to return fire, while still firing effectively on the German ships, and the Germans had to take several evasive maneuvers to avoid the Russian shells. However, by 10:00, the minesweepers had cleared a path through the minefield, and Kronprinz and Knig dashed into the bay. At around 10:15, Kronprinz opened fire on Tsarevitch and Bayan, and scored hits on both. Knig, meanwhile, dispatched Slava. The Russian vessels were hit dozens of times, until at 10:30 the Russian naval commander, Mikhail Bakhirev Admiral Bakhirev, ordered their withdrawal.

On 18 October, Kronprinz was slightly grounded, though the damage was not serious enough to necessitate withdrawal for repairs. By 20 October, the fighting on the islands was winding down; Moon, sel, and Dag were in German possession. The previous day, the Admiralstab had ordered the cessation of naval actions and the return of the dreadnoughts to the High Seas Fleet as soon as possible.Halpern, p. 219 On the 26th, however, Kronprinz was more seriously grounded on the return trip to Kiel. She managed to reach Kiel on 2 November, and subsequently Wilhelmshaven. Repairs were effected from 24 November to 8 January.

Fate
On 27 January 1918, the Wilhelm II, German Emperor Kaiser directed that the ship be renamed Kronprinz Wilhelm in honor of the William, German Crown Prince Crown Prince. The ship was formally renamed on 15 June 1918, the 30th anniversary of the Kaiser's reign. Kronprinz Wilhelm and her three sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918, days before the Armistice with Germany Armistice was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheerby now the Grand Admiral Groadmiral of the fleetintended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany, despite the expected casualties. However, many of the war-weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war.Tarrant, pp. 280281 On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on SMS Thringen  2 and then on several other battleships, including Kronprinz Wilhelm, mutinied.Tarrant, pp. 281282 The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation.Tarrant, p. 282 Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated I no longer have a navy.Herwig, p. 252

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral Adolf von Trotha made clear to von Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any conditions.Herwig, p. 256 The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser HMS Cardiff D58 2, which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive flotilla consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships.Herwig, pp. 254255 Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks, and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and men.Herwig, p. 255

The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Kronprinz Wilhelm sank at 13:15; The British guard detail panicked in their attempted to prevent the Germans from scuttling the ships;Herwig, p. 257 British soldiers aboard a nearby Naval drifter drifter shot and killed a Fireman steam engine stoker from Kronprinz Wilhelm. In total, the guards killed nine Germans and wounded twenty-one. The remaining crews, totaling some 1,860 officers and enlisted men, were imprisoned. 

Kronprinz Wilhelm was never raised for scrapping, unlike most of the other capital ships that were scuttled. Kronprinz Wilhelm and her two sisters had sunk in deeper water than the other capital ships, which made a salvage attempt more difficult. The outbreak of World War II in 1939 put a halt to all salvage operations, and after the war it was determined that salvaging the deeper wrecks was financially impractical.Butler, p. 229 The rights to future salvage operations on the wreck were sold to Britain in 1962. The depth in which the three battleships sank insulated them from the radiation released by the use of atomic weapons. As a result, Kronprinz Wilhelm and her sisters are one of the only remaining sources of radiation-free steel. The ships have occasionally had steel removed for use in scientific devices. Kronprinz Wilhelm and the other vessels on the bottom of Scapa Flow are a popular dive site, and are protected by a policy barring divers from recovering items from the wrecks.Konstam, p. 187
