Chiefdoms of Hispaniola

The chiefdoms of Hispaniola (cacicazgo in Spanish) delineated the island of Hispaniola (Quisqueya in Ta&lt;U+00ED&gt;no) into five independent territories at the time of their discovery by the Spaniards in 1492. Each was governed by a cacique who held absolute power over their people. The Ta&lt;U+00ED&gt;no inhabitants were of Arawak origin and were the first people to greet the Spanish. At the time, the Tainos were being defeated by a rival group, the Caribs. In 1508, there were about 60,000 Ta&lt;U+00ED&gt;nos in the island of Hispaniola, by 1531 exploitation and disease had reduced the number to 600.
The boundaries of each cacique were clear and precise, the first inhabitants of the island in fact used the natural elements such as references, such as major rivers, high mountains, notable valleys and plains. This made it possible to establish the extent of each territory.1 Each was divided into cacique nita&lt;U+00ED&gt;nos, subdivisions headed by the cacique helpers. The entries below relate the territory of each former cacique to the provinces of the present day Dominican Republic and Haiti.
Chiefdom of Mari&lt;U+00E9&gt;n
 The cacique of Mari&lt;U+00E9&gt;n (cacicazgo of Mari&lt;U+00E9&gt;n) included the entire northwestern part of Hispaniola, bordered to the north by the Atlantic Ocean, the south by the cacique of Jaragua, east by the caciques of Magu&lt;U+00E1&gt; and Maguana, and west by the Windward Passage.
It was ruled by the cacique Guacanagar&lt;U+00ED&gt;x, with headquarters located in El Guarico, near the present city Haiti of Cap-Ha&lt;U+00EF&gt;tien . It was divided into 14 nita&lt;U+00ED&gt;nos. This cacique was the first to welcome Christopher Columbus and to convert to Christianity.
The cacique of Mari&lt;U+00E9&gt;n fought against the cacique Mairena, aided by Caonabo of the cacique of Maguana for control of the mythical goddess 'Mother' Iermao the cacique of Marien. The 'Mother' Iermao was the goddess of the cacique of Mari&lt;U+00E9&gt;n, which means &quot;body stone&quot;.
For this battle, Guacanagar&lt;U+00ED&gt;x allied with the Spanish conquistadors to defeat an alliance of Mairena and Caonabo and thus remain the principal cacique of the whole and the cacique of Mari&lt;U+00E9&gt;n mythical place of Chacuey.

Chiefdom of Maguana
 The cacique of Maguana (cacicazgo of Maguana) was the center of the Quisqueya island, bounded on the north by the caciques of Mari&lt;U+00E9&gt;n and Magu&lt;U+00E1&gt;, south by the Caribbean, east by the caciques of Magu&lt;U+00E1&gt; and Hig&lt;U+00FC&gt;ey, and west by the caciques of Mari&lt;U+00E9&gt;n and Jaragua. This cacique only covered the territories of the current Dominican Republic].
It was ruled by the cacique Caonabo, husband of Anacaona. Its headquarters was established at the place called Corral de los Indios in Juan de Herrera of San Juan. It was divided into 21 nita&lt;U+00ED&gt;nos. This province is devoted to the art of war.
This was the principal cacique of the island and was represented by &quot;Peter&quot;. The term Maguana means &quot;the first stone, the unique stone&quot;. His mother goddess was apito, which means &quot;Mother of Stone&quot;.2
The cacique Caonabo was the first resistance against the Spanish occupation. This chief is accused of being responsible for the destruction of Fort La Navidad, the first Spanish settlement on American soil, installed by Christopher Columbus to the inability to repatriate all of his men to Spain during his first voyage. Because of this attack and the attempted assault of Fort Saint-Thomas, Caonabo was taken prisoner. Alonso de Ojeda tricked him into believing that he would offer her golden shackles. Caonabo was handcuffed and transferred to La Isabela, then sent to Spain. The chief died in a shipwreck while crossing.3

Chiefdom of Jaragua
 The cacique of Jaragua (cacicazgo Jaragua) spanned the entire south-west of the island of Hispaniola. It was bounded on the north by the cacique of Mari&lt;U+00E9&gt;n, south by the Caribbean, east by the caciques of Mari&lt;U+00E9&gt;n and Maguana, and west by the Strait of Jamaica .
It was ruled by the cacique Bohechio. It was the largest of the island. Its headquarters was located in a place called Yaguana, near present-day Port-au-Prince, capital of Haiti. It was divided into 26 nita&lt;U+00ED&gt;nos.
Bohech&lt;U+00ED&gt;o, brother of Anacaona, was to reside at Yaquimo within the chiefdoms of Xaragua because it would support a war against two very primitive, the original inhabitants of the island, some being located in the region of rivers Las Cuevas and Yubo and the other being at the extreme southwest of the island, in a place called Guacayarima. This required Bohech&lt;U+00ED&gt;o to enter a double alliance, first with the cacique of Haniguayagua for the control of the Aborigines of South-West and, on the other hand, with Caonabo for control and access to the ceremonial site of Yubo, the main island.
The mother goddess of the Xaragua cacique was Zuimaco, derived from the union of Xaragua: Zui and Yaquimo: Maco.
