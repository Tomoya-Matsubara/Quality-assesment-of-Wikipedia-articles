__NOTOC__

List indicators

(v) indicates the actor lent only their voice for their film character.
(y) indicates the actor portrayed the role in a flashback scene or when the character was young.
A light grey cell indicates the character was not in the film adaptation.


The following is a list of Harry Potter films cast members, a list of cast members who voiced or portrayed characters appearing in the Harry Potter film series. The list is sorted by film and character, as sometimes a character may have been portrayed by multiple actors.
The list also includes confirmed cast members for the upcoming Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. A light grey cell under the &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; heading indicates that the character does not appear in the book and thus his or her appearance in the film would not strictly follow the book's story; a dark grey cell indicates the character does appear in the book but has not yet been cast, or, if noted otherwise, will not be cast.
