The 2012 Delhi gang rape case involved a rape and fatal assault that occurred on 16 December 2012 in Munirka, a neighbourhood in South Delhi, when a 23-year-old female physiotherapy intern 1 was beaten and gang raped in a private bus in which she was travelling with a male friend. There were six others in the bus, including the driver, all of whom raped the woman and beat her friend. The woman died from her injuries thirteen days later while undergoing emergency treatment in Singapore.23 The incident generated widespread national and international coverage and was widely condemned, both in India and abroad. Subsequently, public protests against the state and central governments for failing to provide adequate security for women took place in New Delhi, where thousands of protesters clashed with security forces. Similar protests took place in major cities throughout the country.
All the accused were arrested and charged with sexual assault and murder. One of the accused, Ram Singh, died in police custody on 11 March 2013 in the Tihar Jail.4 According to some published reports, the police say Ram Singh hanged himself, but defence lawyers and his family suspect he was murdered.5 The rest of the accused went on trial in a fast-track court; the prosecution finished presenting its evidence on 8 July 2013.6 The juvenile was convicted of rape and murder and given the maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment in a reform facility.7 On 10 September 2013, the four remaining adult defendants were found guilty of rape and murder and three days later were sentenced to death by hanging.8910 On 13 March 2014, Delhi High Court in the death reference case and hearing appeals against the conviction by the lower Court, upheld the guilty verdict and the death sentences.11
As a result of the protests, in December 2012, a judicial committee was set up to study and take public suggestions for the best ways to amend laws to provide quicker investigation and prosecution of sex offenders. After considering 80,000 suggestions, the committee submitted a report which indicated that failures on the part of the government and police were the root cause behind crimes against women. In 2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013 was promulgated by President Pranab Mukherjee, several new laws were passed, and six new fast-track courts were created to hear rape cases. Critics argue that the legal system remains slow to hear and prosecute rape cases, but most agree that the case has resulted in a tremendous increase in the public discussion of crimes against women and statistics show that there has been an improvement in the number of women willing to file a crime report. At a memorial held in December 2013, the press interviewed a young woman who had taken part in the protests a year earlier. She related that while &quot;A welcome change is that the taboo on discussion of rape and sexual violence has been broken,&quot; she saw &quot;absolutely no change in the rape culture and related brutality&quot;.12
Incident
The victims, a 23-year-old woman and a male friend, were on their way home on the night of 16 December 2012 after watching the film Life of Pi in Saket, South Delhi.1314 They boarded an off-duty charter bus at Munirka for Dwarka that was being driven by joyriders at about 9:30 pm (IST). There were only six others on the bus, including the driver. One of the men, a minor, had called for passengers telling them that the bus was going towards their destination.1516 The woman's friend became suspicious when the bus deviated from its normal route and its doors were shut. When he objected, the group of six men already on board, including the driver, taunted the couple, asking what they were doing alone at such a late hour.17
When the woman's friend tried to intervene, he was beaten, gagged and knocked unconscious with an iron rod. The men then dragged the woman to the rear of the bus, beating her with the rod and raping her while the bus driver continued to drive. Medical reports later said that the woman suffered serious injuries to her abdomen, intestines and genitals due to the assault, and doctors said that the damage indicated that a blunt object (suspected to be the iron rod) may have been used for penetration.18 That rod was later described by police as being a rusted, L-shaped implement of the type used as a wheel jack handle.1920 21
According to police reports the woman attempted to fight off her assailants, biting three of the attackers and leaving bite marks on the accused men.22 After the beatings and rape ended, the attackers threw both victims from the moving bus. Then the bus driver allegedly tried to drive the bus over the woman, but she was pulled aside by her male friend. One of the perpetrators later cleaned the vehicle to remove evidence. Police impounded it the next day.2324
The partially clothed victims were found on the road by a passerby at around 11 pm (IST). The passerby phoned the Delhi Police, who took the couple to Safdarjung Hospital, where the female victim was given emergency treatment and placed on mechanical ventilation.25 She was found with injury marks, including numerous bite marks, all over her body. According to reports, one of the accused men admitted to having seen a rope-like object, assumed to be her intestines, being pulled out of the woman by the other assailants on the bus. Two blood-stained metal rods were retrieved from the bus and medical staff confirmed that &quot;it was penetration by this that caused massive damage to her genitals, uterus and intestines&quot;.26 27
Victims
The female victim was born and raised in Delhi while her parents were from a small village in the Ballia district of Uttar Pradesh. Her father sold his agricultural land to educate her, and worked double shifts to continue to pay for her schooling. In an interview he related that as a youth he had dreamed of becoming a schoolteacher, but at that time education was not considered important and girls were not even sent to school. &quot;Attitudes are changing back home now, but when I left 30 years ago, I vowed never deny my children so sending them to school was fulfilling my desire for knowledge.&quot;28 He said that he put his daughter's education above that of even his two sons. &quot;It never entered our hearts to ever discriminate. How could I be happy if my son is happy and my daughter isn't? And it was impossible to refuse a little girl who loved going to school.&quot;2930
In compliance with Indian law, the real name of the victim was initially not released to the media, so pseudonyms were used for her by various media houses instead, including Jagruti (&quot;awareness&quot;), Jyoti (&quot;flame&quot;), Amanat (&quot;treasure&quot;), Nirbhaya (&quot;fearless one&quot;), Damini (&quot;lightning&quot;, after the 1993 Hindi film) and Delhi braveheart.3132333435
The man who was attacked, a software engineer from Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, who lives in Ber Sarai, New Delhi, suffered broken limbs but survived.3637
Delhi police registered a criminal case against the editor of a Delhi-based tabloid, Mail Today, for disclosing the female victim's identity, as such disclosure is an offence under section 228(A) of Indian Penal Code.38 Shashi Tharoor, union minister, suggested that if the parents had no objection, her identity could be made public, with a view to showing respect for her courageous response by naming future laws after her, but Tharoor's remark created controversy.39 Speaking to a British press reporter on 5 January, the victim's father was quoted as saying, &quot;We want the world to know her real name. My daughter didn't do anything wrong, she died while protecting herself. I am proud of her. Revealing her name will give courage to other women who have survived these attacks. They will find strength from my daughter.&quot;40 Indian law forbids revealing the name of a rape victim unless the family agrees to it and, following the news article which published the father's reported quote and the victim's name, some news outlets in India, Germany, Australia, and the United States also revealed her name.41 However, the following day Zee News quoted the father as saying, &quot;I have only said we won't have any objection if the government uses my daughter's name for a new law for crime against women that is more stringent and better framed than the existing one.&quot;42
Medical treatment and death
On 19 December 2012, the woman underwent her fifth surgery, removing most of her remaining intestine. Doctors reported that she was in &quot;stable but critical&quot; condition.43 On 21 December, the government appointed a committee of physicians to ensure she received the best medical care.44 By 25 December, she remained intubated, on life support and in critical condition. Doctors stated that she was running a fever of 102 to 103 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (39 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C) and internal bleeding due to sepsis, a severe blood infection that can lead to organ failure, was somewhat controlled. It was reported that she was &quot;stable, conscious and meaningfully communicative&quot;.45
At a cabinet meeting chaired by Manmohan Singh on 26 December, the decision was made to fly her to Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore for further care. Mount Elizabeth is a multi-organ transplant speciality hospital.4647 Some doctors criticised the decision as political, questioning the need to transfer an intensive care unit (ICU) patient for organ transplants that were not scheduled for weeks or even months later.4849 Government sources indicate that the Chief Minister of Delhi, Sheila Dikshit, was personally behind the decision.50 Hours earlier, Union Minister P. Chidambaram had stated that the woman was not in a condition to be moved.51 An anonymous source quoted by The Sunday Guardian stated that the decision to move her was taken &quot;when it was already clear that she would not survive the next 48 hours&quot;.52
During the six-hour flight by air-ambulance to Singapore on 27 December, the woman suddenly went into a &quot;near collapse&quot;, which a later report described as a cardiac arrest.53 The doctors on the flight created an arterial line to stabilise her, but she had been without pulse and blood pressure for nearly three minutes and never regained consciousness in Singapore.54
On 28 December, at 11 am (IST), her condition was extremely critical. The chief executive officer of the Mount Elizabeth Hospital said that the woman suffered brain damage, pneumonia, and abdominal infection, and that she was &quot;fighting for her life.&quot;55 Her condition continued to deteriorate, and she died at 4:45 am on 29 December, Singapore Standard Time (2:15 am, 29 December, IST; 8:45 pm, 28 December, UTC).56 Her body was cremated on 30 December in Delhi under high police security. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the country's main opposition party, criticised the high security levels, stating that they were reminiscent of the Emergency Era, during which civil liberties were suspended.57
Arrests
Police found and arrested some suspects within 24 hours of the crime.58 From recordings made by a highway CCTV vehicle, a description of the bus, a white charter bus with a name written on it, was broadcast. Other operators identified it as being contracted by a South Delhi private school. They then traced it and found its driver, Ram Singh. Police obtained sketches of the assailants with the help of the male victim, and used a cell phone stolen from the two victims to find one of the assailants.59
Six men were arrested in connection with the incident. They included Ram Singh, the bus driver, and his brother, Mukesh Singh, who were both arrested in Rajasthan. Ram and Mukesh Singh lived in Ravidas camp, a slum in South Delhi.60 Vinay Sharma, an assistant gym instructor, and Pawan Gupta, a fruit seller, were both arrested in Delhi.61 A seventeen-year-old juvenile from Badayun, Uttar Pradesh,626364 was arrested at the Anand Vihar terminal in Delhi. The juvenile had only met the others that day.65 Akshay Thakur, who had come to Delhi seeking employment, was arrested in Aurangabad.6667
According to reports, the group had been eating and drinking together and &quot;having a party&quot; earlier in the day.68 Although the charter bus which Ram Singh drove on weekdays was not permitted to pick up public passengers69 or even to operate in Delhi because of its tinted windows,70 they decided to take it out &quot;to have some fun&quot;.71 With Mukesh Singh driving, they first picked up a carpenter who was charged 10 for a ticket and then robbed of 8,000 and ejected in South Delhi.72
Shortly after the attacks, Gupta said he accepted his guilt and should be hanged.7374 Mukesh Singh, who was placed in Tihar Jail after his arrest, was assaulted by other inmates and was kept in solitary confinement for his own protection.75
Ram Singh was presented before the Metropolitan Magistrate on 18 December 2012.76 He refused to participate in an identification process.77 Investigation revealed a history of frequent drinking that resulted in &quot;blinding rage&quot;, &quot;bad temper&quot;, and quarrels with employers, that had led friends to call him &quot;mental&quot;.78 On 11 March, Ram Singh was discovered hanging from a ventilator shaft in his cell at about 5:45 am.79 Authorities said it was unclear whether it was a suicide or a murder.808182
Trial
The male victim testified in court on 19 December 2012.83 The female victim recorded her statement with a sub-divisional magistrate at the Safdarjung Hospital on 21 December, in the presence of the Deputy Commissioner of police.84
On 21 December, the government promised to file the charge sheet quickly and seek the maximum penalty of life imprisonment for the perpetrators.85 Following public outrage and a demand for a speedy trial and prosecution, on 24 December, the police promised to file the charge sheet within one week.86 The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs met on 27 December to discuss the issue, and Union Home Secretary R. K. Singh and Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar were summoned to appear.87 At the suggestion of the Delhi Chief Minister, the Delhi High Court approved the creation of five fast-track courts to try rape and sexual assault cases.88 The first of the five approved fast-track courts was inaugurated on 2 January 2013 by Altamas Kabir, Chief Justice of India, in Saket court complex of South Delhi.89
On 21 December, the Delhi High Court reprimanded the Delhi police for being &quot;evasive&quot; in a probe status report providing details of officers on patrol duty in the area covered by the bus route.90 A further court hearing on the matter was scheduled for 9 January 2013.91 The following day, the Delhi Police initiated action against three Hauz Khas police station personnel for alleged inaction of an alleged robbery committed against the carpenter by the occupants of the bus in which the gang rape and assault occurred.92 On 24 December, two Assistant Commissioners of Police were suspended for failing to prevent the gang rape incident.93
Juvenile defendant
In the 33-page charge sheet, the Delhi Police described the juvenile as the most brutal of the six accused.94959697 The accused was declared as 17 years and six months old on the day of the crime by the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), which relied on his birth certificate and school documents. The JJB rejected a police request for a bone ossification (age determination) test for a positive documentation of his age.9899100
On 28 January 2013, the JJB determined that the juvenile would not be tried as an adult. A petition moved by Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy seeking the prosecution of the minor as an adult because of the extremely voilent nature of his alleged crime was rejected by the JJB.101102103 The minor was tried separately in a juvenile court.
A verdict in the case was scheduled to be announced on 25 July,104 but was deferred until 5 August105 and then deferred again to 19 August.106 On 31 August, the juvenile was convicted of rape and murder under the Juvenile Justice Act and given the maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment in a reform facility, inclusive of the eight months he spent in remand during the trial.107
Adult defendants
Five days after the victim's death, on 3 January 2013, the police filed charges against the five adult men for rape, murder, kidnapping,108109 destruction of evidence, and the attempted murder of the woman's male companion.110 Senior lawyer Dayan Krishnan was appointed as the special public prosecutor.111 Mukesh Singh, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur and Pawan Gupta denied the charges. Some of the men had confessed earlier, however their lawyers said that their clients had been tortured and that their confessions had been coerced.112113
On 10 January, one of their lawyers, Manohar Lal Sharma, said in a media interview that the victims were responsible for the assault because they should not have been using public transportation and, as an unmarried couple, they should not have been on the streets at night. He went on to say: &quot;Until today I have not seen a single incident or example of rape with a respected lady. Even an underworld don would not like to touch a girl with respect.&quot;114 He also called the male victim &quot;wholly responsible&quot; for the incident because he &quot;failed in his duty to protect the woman&quot;.115
The four surviving adult defendants went on trial in a fast-track court. The prosecution presented evidence including witness statements, the victim's statement, fingerprints, DNA testing, and dental modelling. It completed its case on 8 July.116117
Conviction and sentencing
On 10 September 2013, the four adult defendants were found guilty of rape, murder, unnatural offences and destruction of evidence. All four men faced the death penalty, and demonstrators outside the courthouse called for the hanging of the defendants.118119 The victim's father also called for the defendants to be hanged, stating, &quot;We will get complete closure only if all the accused are wiped off from the face of the earth.&quot;120 Lawyers for three of the four stated that their clients intended to appeal the verdict.121 The four men were sentenced on 13 September to death by hanging.122 Judge Yogesh Khanna rejected pleas for a lesser sentence saying the case has &quot;shocked the collective conscience of India&quot;, and that &quot;courts cannot turn a blind eye to such crimes&quot;.123124 The victim's family was present for the sentencing and her mother expressed satisfaction over the verdict saying, &quot;We were waiting with bated breath, now we are relieved. I thank the people of my country and the media.&quot;125 After the verdict was delivered, the people waiting outside the courtroom applauded.126
On 13 March 2014, the Delhi High Court found all the defendants guilty of rape, murder, unnatural offenses and destruction of evidence. With the verdict, the High Court confirmed death sentence for all four men convicted in September 2013. The court noted that the crime, which stirred widespread protests over sexual crimes against women in the country, fell into the judicial system's &quot;rarest of rare category&quot; that allows capital punishment. The lawyers of the four men said they will appeal to the Supreme Court.127
Public protests
After the incident
 Public protests took place in New Delhi on 21 December 2012 at India Gate and Raisina Hill, the latter being the location of both the Parliament of India and Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India. Thousands of protesters clashed with police and battled Rapid Action Force units.128 Demonstrators were lathi charged,129 shot with water cannon and tear gas shells, and arrested.130
Similar protests occurred throughout the country. More than 600 women belonging to various organisations demonstrated in Bangalore.131132 Thousands of people silently marched in Kolkata.133 Protests occurred online as well on the social networking sites Facebook and WhatsApp, with users replacing their profile images with a black dot symbol.134 Tens of thousands signed an online petition protesting the incident.135
Yoga guru Baba Ramdev and former Army chief General Vijay Kumar Singh were among the demonstrators who clashed with Delhi Police at Jantar Mantar.136 On 24 December, activist Rajesh Gangwar started a hunger strike, saying about the accused men, &quot;If my death shakes the system and gets them hanged, I am ready to die&quot;.137 Gangwar ended his fast after 14 days, saying, &quot;My fight to demand a strict law against rape will be continued in the future... I have dedicated myself for this cause&quot;.138
 Seven metro rail stations in New Delhi were closed on 22 December to discourage protesters from gathering at Raisina Hill.139 On 24 December, police blocked roads leading to India Gate and Raisina Hill to prevent possible mass protests, and closed nine metro stations, affecting thousands of transit patrons. News reporters were not allowed to reach India Gate and Raisina Hill. In addition to CrPC section 144, which disallows assembly of groups larger than five, curfew was imposed near the presidential residence.140 The Hindustan Times accused police of using excessive force against the protestors, reporting that 375 tear gas canisters were used at India Gate and elsewhere in Delhi to disperse the crowds.141 An article in First Post criticised the Indian government as well, saying that they failed to act positively or give credible assurances to the protesters and instead used police force, lathi-charging, pushing the media out of the scene, and shutting down metro rail stations.142 Police stated that peaceful protests had been &quot;hijacked&quot; by hooligans and political activists.143
During one protest, a police constable named Subhash Tomar collapsed and later died in hospital.144 Two witnesses claimed that Tomar collapsed without being hit by any protesters, while a third disputed this.145 Hospital doctors and the post-mortem gave contradictory reports: he died due to cardiac arrest, but it is not known if the heart attack was caused by blunt-force injuries that he suffered to his chest and neck.146 Some experts state that his chest injuries may have been a side effect of the administration of CPR.147148 The Delhi Police arrested 8 young men and charged them with Tomar's murder and rioting at India Gate. Later in March 2013, the police admitted in the High Court they had no evidence against the eight and gave them a clean chit.149 The youths said the move by the commissioner of police to charge them with murder had been &quot;irresponsible&quot;.150
After the death

People in Bangalore protesting outside Bangalore Town Hall on 30 December 2012

After the woman's death on 29 December 2012, protests were staged all over India, including Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, Mumbai and Visakhapatnam. Many of the mourners carried candles and wore black dress; some pasted black cloth across their mouths.151
The following day a large number of people staged protests near Jantar Mantar, New Delhi.152 There were minor clashes between some groups of protesters and the police; the police then removed some protesters from the area.153 One group of protesters also observed a one-day hunger strike at Jantar Mantar.154 All roads leading to India Gate were closed by police and areas where protesters had gathered during the previous week were out of bounds to the public.155 Some of the protesters drew graffiti and slogans on papers spread on the road, condemning the incident and demanding stricter laws and speedy judgement.156 The BJP renewed its demand for a special parliament session to discuss the case and to adopt stricter laws on crime against women.157
New Year's celebrations were scaled down to a large extent, with the Indian armed forces and some clubs and hotels in Delhi cancelling their New Year parties.158
The Indian protests also sparked protests across south Asia, including marches and rallies in Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh. In Nepal, hundreds of demonstrators in Kathmandu called for legal reforms and an overhaul of attitudes to women. In Bangladesh the human rights group Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK) said the protests in Delhi had given fresh impetus to protests against sexual violence. According to an ASK spokesperson, &quot;although previous demonstrations on similar issues were largely dominated by women, men were now protesting too. The protests had also drawn people from a broad range of society.&quot;159 
In Paris, people participated in a march to the Indian embassy where a petition was handed over asking for action to make India safer for women.160
An author for the South Asia Analysis Group explained the protests as expressions of middle-class angst arising out of a collapse of a social contract between them and the liberal state.161 New Delhi has the highest number of sex crimes among India's major cities. Police figures show a rape reported on average every 18 hours; reported rape cases rose by nearly 17 percent between 2007 and 2011.162 Only one of 706 rape cases filed in Delhi in 2012 ended in conviction.163 Between 16 December and 4 January, 501 calls for harassment and 64 calls for rape were recorded by the Delhi Police, but only four were followed up by inquiries.164 The regional program director for U.N. Women South Asia said, &quot;There are rape cases in almost all cities and rural areas, where the victim dies immediately because of the brutality of the crime ... This time, it was like, 'Wake up.'&quot;165
Reactions
Members of the Indian parliament demanded severe punishment for the perpetrators. The Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, stated: &quot;The rapists should be hanged&quot;.166 Sonia Gandhi visited the Safdarjang Hospital and met doctors on duty in the anaesthesia and surgery departments for an update on the woman's health.167 Bahujan Samaj Party chief, Mayawati, said that proper investigation was required, and that &quot;action should be so strict that no one should dare to act in such a manner again&quot;.168 Actress and member of the Rajya Sabha, Jaya Bachchan said that she was &quot;terribly disturbed&quot; over the incident, and felt &quot;ashamed&quot; sitting in the House, feeling &quot;helpless&quot; for &quot;not being able to do anything&quot;.169 Meira Kumar, Speaker of the Lok Sabha, told reporters a &quot;new law should be brought in and must get passed to ensure the safety of women.&quot;170 She went on to say: &quot;The laws at present are not enough, we need stricter laws.&quot;171172
Sheila Dikshit, who at that time was the Chief Minister of Delhi, said that she did not have the courage to meet the victim and described Delhi as a &quot;rape capital&quot; in interviews.173 She said that senior police officials should be held accountable for the failure to take adequate measures to stop such incidents and called for &quot;immediate setting up of fast-track courts to try rape cases and to get justice in a time-bound manner&quot;.174
On 24 December 2012, in his first official reaction after the incident, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appealed for calm, stressing that &quot;violence will serve no purpose&quot;.175 In a televised address, he assured that all possible efforts would be made to ensure the safety of women in India. Singh expressed empathy, saying: &quot;As a father of three daughters I feel as strongly about the incident as each one of you&quot;.176 As a tribute to the female victim, the prime minister cancelled all his official events to celebrate the new year.177 The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav, announced a package of financial assistance  and a government job to the family of the woman.178
Speaking out against the protesters, President Pranab Mukherjee's son Abhijit Mukherjee argued that the women protesters did not appear to him to be students, saying,&quot;What's basically happening in Delhi is a lot like Egypt or elsewhere, where there's something called the Pink Revolution, which has very little connection with ground realities. In India, staging candle-lit marches, going to discotheques ... I can see many beautiful women among them &lt;U+2013&gt; highly dented-painted ... [but] I have grave doubts whether they're students ...&quot;179 The remark was widely condemned as sexist.180 His sister Sharmistha said that she and their father the president both disapproved.181 Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan also expressed disapproval.182 Abhijit quickly withdrew his comment and apologised.183 Spiritual guru Asaram Bapu also provoked extensive criticism from the public184 by saying that the victim was also to blame for her own assault because she could have stopped the attack if she had &quot;chanted God's name and fallen at the feet of the attackers&quot;.185
International
The American embassy released a statement on 29 December 2012, offering their condolences to the woman's family and stating &quot;we also recommit ourselves to changing attitudes and ending all forms of gender-based violence, which plagues every country in the world&quot;.186 The female victim was posthumously awarded one of the 2013 International Women of Courage Awards of the US State Department. The citation stated that &quot;for millions of Indian women, her personal ordeal, perseverance to fight for justice, and her family's continued bravery is helping to lift the stigma and vulnerability that drive violence against women.&quot;187
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated, &quot;Violence against women must never be accepted, never excused, never tolerated. Every girl and woman has the right to be respected, valued and protected&quot;.188 UN Women called on the Government of India and the Government of Delhi &quot;to do everything in their power to take up radical reforms, ensure justice and reach out with robust public services to make women's lives more safe and secure&quot;.189
In the wake of remarks against India in western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US commentators exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture.190 Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder was a turning point in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India at the time of the rape and murder and that after

having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the center of every discourse, in the center of the college students' discussions, in the center of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.191

Results of protests
In view of the widespread protests, governments at the centre and various states announced several steps to ensure the safety of women. The Government of Karnataka announced the launch of a 24/7 dedicated helpline (1091) to be operated by the state police to register sexual abuse complaints from women.192 It also is checking the possibility of setting up fast-track courts to dispose of pending cases pertaining to crimes against women.193 The Government of Tamil Nadu also announced a 13-point action plan to ensure safety of women in Tamil Nadu and said that incidents of sexual assault would be treated as a grave crime, and probes would be entrusted to top police officials. The chief minister also said that daily hearings would be conducted in all sexual abuse cases in the state for speedy trials at specially constituted fast-track courts, and women prosecutors would be appointed as government counsels.194 The Jammu and Kashmir government also announced plans to change the state's laws against sexual offences and gender crimes. The Government of Himachal Pradesh decided to set up state and district-level committees to review progress of all cases of crimes against women.195
Justice Verma Committee and changes in law

On 22 December 2012, a judicial committee headed by J. S. Verma, a former Chief Justice of India and one of India's most highly regarded Chief Justices and eminent jurists, was appointed by the Central government to submit a report within 30 days to suggest amendments to criminal law to sternly deal with sexual assault cases. The committee urged the public in general and particularly eminent jurists, legal professionals, NGOs, women's groups and civil society to share &quot;their views, knowledge and experience suggesting possible amendments in the criminal and other relevant laws to provide for quicker investigation, prosecution and trial, and also enhanced punishment for criminals accused of committing sexual assault of an extreme nature against women.&quot;.196 The Committee held its first meeting on 26 December 2012; it had received more than 6000 emails with suggestions by then.197 The Justice Verma Committee report was submitted after 29 days, after considering 80,000 suggestions received during the period. The report indicated that failures on the part of the government and police were the root cause behind crimes against women. Suggestions in the report included the need to review the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA) in conflict areas, and setting the maximum punishment for rape as life imprisonment rather than the death penalty. The committee did not favour lowering the age of a juvenile from 18 to 16.198199
On 26 December 2012, a Commission of Inquiry headed by former Delhi High Court judge Usha Mehra was set up to identify lapses, determine responsibility in relation to the incident, and suggest measures to make Delhi and the wider National Capital Region safer for women.200 On 1 January 2013, a task force headed by the Union Home Secretary was established to look into women's safety issues in Delhi and review the functioning of the city police force on a regular basis.201
On 3 February 2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013 was promulgated by President Pranab Mukherjee. It provides for amendment of the Indian Penal Code, Indian Evidence Act, and Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, on laws related to sexual offences.202203 The ordinance provides for the death penalty in cases of rape. According to Minister of Law and Justice Ashwani Kumar, 90 percent of the suggestions given by the Verma Committee Report were incorporated into the Ordinance. However, critics state that many key suggestions of the commission have been ignored, including the criminalization of marital rape and trying military personnel accused of sexual offences under criminal law.204
In a December 2013 interview, the rape victim's parents, Badri Nath Singh and Asha Devi, said they are trying to get the juvenile law changed in such crimes as the rape and murder of their daughter. They petitioned the Supreme Court to try the juvenile, just short of 18 when he committed the crime, in a criminal court instead of a Juvenile Justice court.205
Legacy
Anniversary memorials
On 16 December 2013, the anniversary of the attack, activists held memorials throughout New Delhi in memory of the rape victim widely known as Nirbhaya, meaning &quot;fearless&quot;. Members of women's organisations lit candles in her memory and protested against exploitation of women. University students and others organised a candlelight march at the bus stand in South Delhi where the woman and her friend boarded the bus in which the rape and beatings took place.206 At a commemorative prayer meeting political leaders resolved to increase efforts to improve women's security. Speaking with the victim's mother, former chief minister Sheila Dikshit said that Delhi's society and the various authorities will work together to build a permanent legacy to her daughter: &quot;... whatever you will want in her memory, we will try to fulfill. And we will try with a conviction that such an incident is not repeated with anybody else in the future&quot;.207
The victim's parents spoke at a memorial saying that they were proud of the courage that their daughter showed, which they believe &quot;has spurred more women to speak out instead of hiding the crimes committed against them&quot;.208
Improvements to the legal system
The outpouring of anger and grief following the rape and murder gave rise to hopes for change in India.209 The government responded with the passage of several new sexual assault laws, including a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years for gang rape, and six new fast-track courts created solely for rape prosecutions.210 As an indicator of the scope of the problem of rape prosecution, the &quot;Nirbhaya&quot; case was the only conviction obtained among the 706 rape cases filed in New Delhi in 2012.211 Between 16 December 2012 and 4 January 2013, Delhi police recorded 501 allegations of harassment and 64 of rape, but only four inquiries were launched. However, it appears that the &quot;Nirbhaya&quot; case has had an effect on the willingness of rape or molestation victims to report the crime; police records show that during the final nine months of 2013 almost twice as many rape victims filed a police report and four times as many allegations of molestation were made.212 A recent report released by the National Crime Records Bureau shows that 95 percent of the cases brought to the police were classified as a crime. However, there is a large backlog of cases with fewer than 15 percent of those charged tried in 2012, leaving 85 percent waiting to come to trial.213
On 16 December 2013, the one-year anniversary of the rape was commemorated in London with a public memorial to honor the victim. Speakers included Meera Syal, whose parents are from New Delhi. Speaking of the anger that was expressed at the time of the rape, she said, &quot;We need to hold onto that anger and demand that the Indian Government enforces all the promised changes of its recent Criminal Law Amendment Act, which changed laws to expand the definition of rape and incorporated new offences including acid attack, sexual harassment, voyeurism and stalking&quot;.214 She also said that activists need to act in solidarity with other organisations to stop violence against women and girls around the world.215
Public discussions about violence against women
Observers agree that the victim's ordeal has brought a change to public conversations about women's issues, with men joining in the discussions as well. A young woman who had taken part in the protests at the time of the rape said a year later, &quot;A welcome change is that the taboo on discussing rape and sexual violence has been broken. The protests brought debates and discussions to our homes.&quot;216 She also said that since the rape and protests the media is now providing coverage of sexual violence. However, she saw &quot;absolutely no change in the rape culture and related brutality. The streets are not safe. Teasing [Eve teasing] and catcalling or worse are to be found everywhere. Sexual harassment in public places as well as inside the home is still rampant.&quot;217 She added, &quot;I do acknowledge, however, that a year is too less to undo what patriarchy has done over centuries. It is too embedded in our homes, our institutions and in our laws. The police may be a little more receptive, but it is not out of a sense of duty but out of the fear of censure&quot;.218
Nirbhaya Trust
The family of the victim recently established the Nirbhaya Trust,219 an institute formed to assist women who have experienced violence to find shelter and legal assistance. Due to the fact that Indian laws do not allow the publishing of a rape victim's name, it was named Nirbhaya which means fearless in Hindi, after the name used by the media. The victim's father stated, &quot;So many people supported us, so ... we want [to] help those girls who have no one.&quot;220
