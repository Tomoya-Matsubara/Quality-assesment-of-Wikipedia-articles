Diana was a BBC TV series first broadcast in 1984 and adapted from two books by R. F. Delderfield. The adaptation was by the prolific Andrew Davies.
It follows the intersecting but very different lives of Jan, a poor but studious young country lad and Diana, the equally single minded daughter of a rich landowner, from the 1920s through to post-war Britain. The early story revolves around the class mismatch between the pair; the besotted Jan attempts to elevate his status through hard work and the more aloof Diana attempts to keep her affections in check and pursue her own goals.
Unusually, despite a generally warm reception and a host of stars – including a young Patsy Kensit – it has never been repeated on the BBC and has never been made available for purchase.
