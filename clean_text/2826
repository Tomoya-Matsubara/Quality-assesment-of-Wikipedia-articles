In 2005, he launched his own film production company called Grand Hustle Films, signed a multi-artist joint venture deal for his label with Atlantic Records, and established a music publishing deal for Grand Hustle Music with Warner Chappell. He also produced the soundtrack to the film Hustle &amp; Flow and released the collection through Grand Hustle/Atlantic Records.&lt;ref name&quot;&quot;&gt; He also did the same for the debut album of his group P$C, 25 To Life.
According to his Grand Hustle website, T.I. has a clothing line; AKOO (A King Of Oneself) launching in spring 2007.
Background
T.I. grew up in the Bankhead neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia, born to Violetta and Clifford Harris Sr. His original stage name, T.I.P., stems from his childhood nickname &quot;Tip&quot;, which he got from his grandfather. T.I. was first exposed to hip-hop at the age of seven, and by the time he was 11 he had decided to pursue a career in rap seriously, he signed his first record deal at age 19.
Due to his Southern drawl, many fans mistook his name for &quot;Chip&quot;, so he began spelling it out &quot;T.I.P&quot;. Upon signing with Arista Records subsidiary LaFace Records in 2001, he shortened his name to T.I. out of respect for label mate Q-Tip.
He is also known to go by &quot;Rubberband Man&quot; and the self-proclaimed &quot;King of the South&quot; (which has created several cases of controversy between other southern rappers, such as Lil' Flip and Ludacris). He served as Bow Wow's ghostwriter for a while, he also wrote about 30% percent of his third album Unleashed, he wrote the 3rd verse and chorus to his single &quot;Let's Get Down&quot;.1 He has written lyrics for other artists such as Diddy, Ciara &amp; Lil Kim.
T.I. is known for his rapid-fire delivery of lyrics, there were also some noticeable changes in the way he flowed through out his career. Earlier in his career he flowed in a slow-like, southern fashion which can be heard in songs like &quot;I'm Serious&quot;, &quot;24's&quot; and &quot;Never Scared&quot;. In the second era of his career, he sound more relaxed and laid back (ex. &quot;Bring Em Out&quot;,&quot;Soldier&quot;,What You Know,&quot;U Don't Know Me&quot; &amp; &quot;ASAP&quot;). Later on in his career his flow went from a slow and drowsy effect (ex. Top Back, and Drive Slow) to a faster flow which can be heard in &quot;We Takin Over&quot;, &quot;My Love&quot;, &quot;Make It Rain Remix&quot; &amp; I'm a Flirt Remix. T.I.'s flow continues to change through out every song he appears on.
Music career
I'm Serious
His debut album I'm Serious was released through Arista Records, which spawned the single of the same title which featured reggae vocalist Beenie Man. His debut album included Pharrell Williams of The Neptunes (who named him the Jay-Z of the south), Jazze Pha and Youngbloodz. Production by Pharrell, DJ Toomp, and The Grand Hustle Team. However, the album did not sell very well, and he was dropped from the label. The album sold 268,000 copies.
T.I. released the first single &quot;I'm Serious&quot; with Beenie Man. The single had little airplay, but failed to meet the charts. The label wouldn't release another single or video for the album, so he went and created a video for &quot;Dope Boyz&quot;, the video nor the single been released.
He released several mixtapes with the assistance of DJ Drama, which created an underground buzz. He resurfaced in the summer of 2003 on Bonecrusher's song &quot;Neva Scared&quot;. He parlayed this attention towards the release of his second album, Trap Muzik. Undaunted, he formed Grand Hustle Records (distributed by Atlantic Records) in 2003 with his manager Jason Geter. T.I. and Jeter decided to create the label shortly after being dropped by Arista Records.
Trap Muzik
T.I. released Trap Muzik in the summer of 2003 and it debuted #4 and sold 193,000 copies in its first week.&lt;ref name&quot;&quot;&gt; It was more of a success than his debut album because of the singles &quot;24's&quot;, &quot;Be Easy&quot;, &quot;Rubber Band Man&quot;, and &quot;Let's Get Away&quot;. The album featured guest appearances by Eightball &amp; MJG, Jazze Pha, Bun B, &amp; Macboney and producers include Jazze Pha, Kanye West, David Banner, &amp; DJ Toomp. The success of the album was followed by some controversy: while on tour, T.I. was charged with violating his probation over a 2003 drug charge, and turned himself in. He was sentenced to three years in prison. While there he was granted rights to film the music video for &quot;Let's Get Away&quot;. Trap Muzik was released through Grand Hustle Records and sold over 1 million copies in the U.S. and was certified Platinum.
T.I. released 24's as the first single. It had reached #78 in the U.S. #27 on the U.S. R&amp;B chart, and #15 on the Rap charts. 24's can be heard in movies and television.
&quot;Be Easy&quot; was chosen as the second single, the single wasn't successful as the first single, but it reached #55 on the U.S. R&amp;B charts.
Rubberband Man was chosen at Trap Muzik's third single. The single was his second successful single from the album. It reached #30 in the U.S., #15 on the U.S. R&amp;B chart, and #11 on the Rap Charts.
T.I. released his last single from Trap Muzik, &quot;Lets Get Away&quot; with Jazze Pha. It reached #35 in the U.S. #17 on U.S. R&amp;B chart, and #10 in Rap. T.I. won for Best Street Anthem for &quot;Rubberband Man&quot; at the 2004 Vibe Awards.
Urban Legend
T.I. released his third album Urban Legend in late 2004. Urban Legend instantly generated crossover success with the hit single &quot;Bring 'Em Out&quot;. He used a sample from Jay-Z's &quot;What More Can I Say&quot; from The Black Album to create the hook. &quot;Bring 'Em Out&quot; is used to introduce the starting lineup for the Miami Heat. The album featured production from Ruff Ryders's producer Swizz Beatz. The album featured Trick Daddy, Nelly, Lil' Jon, B.G., Mannie Fresh of the Big Tymers, Daz Dillinger, Lil' Wayne, Pharrell of The Neptunes, P$C and Lil' Kim. The album was certified platinum by selling 1.3 million copies. The chopped and screwed version of this album exists.
At the beginning of 2005, T.I. enjoyed success alongside Lil' Wayne on the Destiny's Child song &quot;Soldier&quot;, which proved to be a worldwide smash hit.
T.I. released his second single &quot;U Don't Know Me&quot;. The single appeared on U.S. charts, Rap charts, U.S. R&amp;B charts, Pop 100 charts, and the U.K. charts. It was rumored that song was directed to former rivalry Ludacris due to the fact that he had a song called &quot;Get Back&quot; where he says; &quot;Get Back..Get Back..you don't know me like that&quot; which was released around the same time the single was released. He won for Best Street Anthem for &quot;U Don't Know Me&quot; at the 2005 Vibe Awards.
His 3rd single &quot;A.S.A.P&quot;. It reached #75 on the U.S. charts, #18 on the U.S. R&amp;B charts, #14 on the Rap charts, and #35 on the U.K. singles chart. T.I. created a video for &quot;ASAP&quot;/&quot;Motivation&quot;. However, &quot;Motivation&quot; appeared on the U.S. R&amp;B singles chart, but not on the other charts like &quot;A.S.A.P&quot;.
&quot;Get Loose&quot; feat. Nelly was released as a song that started to get radio play, it was produced by Jazze Pha. It was rumored to have a video made, but it didn't happened. It reached #70 on Billboard's R&amp;B charts.
In 2006, T.I. received two Grammy Award nominations: Best Song Collaboration (&quot;Soldier&quot; w/ Destiny's Child &amp; Lil Wayne) and Best Solo Performance for &quot;U Don't Know Me&quot; at The 48th Annual Grammy Awards.
King
His fourth album, King debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart on April 4, 2006, selling 522,000 copies in its first week. It became Atlantic Records' best-selling album in 15 years.&lt;ref name&quot;&quot;&gt; T.I. released his promo-singles &quot;Front Back&quot; and &quot;Ride With Me&quot; before the album's release date. The singles had small attention, but it helped promote the album and his debut movie ATL. The album also included other singles, What You Know, Why You Wanna, Live In The Sky, and Top Back. KING has earned numerous awards and nominations including a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. Even though Jay-Z surpassed him in his first week album sales, KING is still considered to be the best-selling hip hop/rap album of 2006.
In Spring of 2006, T.I. released his second single &quot;What You Know&quot;. The song has also been used in promotion of the film ATL, in which T.I. stars. It has garnered a 5-star rating from Pitchfork Media. The song peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100, and it also topped the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart and Rap Charts. It utilizes a sample of Roberta Flack's version of The Impressions's &quot;Gone Away&quot; and Hey Joe. It was rumored that T.I. was taking shots at Lil Flip on the song.
What You Know won for &quot;Best Rap Solo Performance&quot; and was nominated for &quot;Best Rap Song&quot; at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards.
Pitchfork Media also ranked What You Know as the 3rd best song of 2006 and his collaboration with Justin Timberlake in the song &quot;My Love&quot; was also ranked at number one on the same list. VIBE recently named T.I.'s &quot;What You Know&quot; as the Top Song of 2006. Rolling Stone ranked the single as number four.
&quot;Why You Wanna&quot; was released as the next single. The chorus samples Q-Tip's vocals from Got 'Til It's Gone with Janet Jackson and also contained samples a slowed-down keyboard chord from Crystal Waters' &quot;Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless)&quot;. The song reached #29 in the U.S., #43 on the SWI charts, #49 on the AUS charts, #17 on the Ireland charts, #22 on the U.K. singles charts, and #30 on Tokio's Hot 100 making the single successful worldwide. The video paid a tribute to T.I.'s deceased friend Phil, who was killed in Cincinnati. He appeared in the video as well.
&quot;Live In The Sky&quot; featuring Jamie Foxx had enough airplay but it didn't reach the U.S. charts, but it has reached on U.S. R&amp;B charts. T.I. released the song to pay tribute to deceased friends, he revealed that he shedded tears while writing this song.
T.I. collaborated with Justin Timberlake for My Love which proved to be a worldwide hit. It earned him a Grammy Award for Best Collaboration for &quot;My Love&quot; with Justin Timberlake at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards.
T.I. released his last single off KING, Top Back. T.I. decided to add Young Dro, Young Jeezy, B.G., and Big Kuntry to create a remix. This version was released from Grand Hustle Presents: In Da Streetz Volume 4. Billboard doesn't have Top Back Remix listed, but Top Back instead. The remixed version and the portion of the video can be also heard and seen on Chevrolet's Impala commercial. He appeared in Chevrolet's Super Bowl XLI commercial performing his single Top Back remix with the same scene from the video.
He appeared in a Chevrolet commercial, where he and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. traded cars (T.I. was driving the #8 race car on the track very slowly, while Earnhardt was driving the black Chevy on the highway very fast).
T.I. vs. T.I.P
T.I. is currently in the studio working on his 5th album T.I. vs. T.I.P. which is set to be released on July 3rd (U.S.). T.I. explained the album&lt;U+2019&gt;s title, saying, &quot;It&lt;U+2019&gt;s basically a battle within myself. There&lt;U+2019&gt;s not nobody out there doing what I do as well as I do it, so I see myself as worthy competition for myself.&quot;
He is also working on other rappers B.G., Khao, Big Kuntry King, Young Dro, and DJ Drama's albums, the release date has not been set.
Acting career
 In the Spring of 2006, T.I. starred in his first film, ATL. The other cast members included Lauren London, Andre Patton, Evan Ross, Mykelti Williamson, Jason Weaver, and Keith David. The movie was written by Tina Gordon Chism and Antwone Fisher, produced by Timothy M. Bourne, Tionne Watkins, and Will Smith, and directed by Christopher Robinson. T.I. played the character Rashad Swann, an orphaned 17-year-old senior in high school. He grew up on the southside of Atlanta. He lives with his uncle and has a younger brother named Ant. In its opening weekend, the film grossed a total of $11.5 million, ranking third in the United States box office, and went on to gross $21.2 million nationwide.2
T.I. will be starring in an upcoming Ridley Scott film called American Gangster, a Scarface-like flim with Oscar-winners Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, and fellow rappers Common &amp; RZA about a police detective (Crowe) pursuing a Harlem drug lord (Washington) during the 1970s. This movie is based on the life of Frank Lucas, which T.I. will be starring as his nephew. T.I. stated working with the Oscar-winners is an honor and he feels like he's going to school and learning the best from them.3
T.I. and his partner Jason Geter have sold a script entitled &quot;For Sale&quot; to New Line Cinema. Launching the film division of Tip and Geter's Grand Hustle Entertainment, the script takes place in an Atlanta used-car lot. Reports say T.I. may play one of the salesmen. Toby Emmerich of New Line apparently secured the deal. Emmerich, Sam Brown and Jeff Katz will supervise the film on behalf of New Line. He is also working on another film from the company called &quot;Random Check&quot;.
Disputes
In 2004, T.I. received an early release from incarceration, and returned to music with some disparaging words for rival rappers Lil' Flip and Ludacris.
Ludacris
T.I. called out Ludacris over an old disagreement their crews had with one another. Ludacris made a music video in which a person in a shirt that resembled a Trap Muzik shirt was seen being beaten, and, although Ludacris stated in an interview on MTV.com that the person in the video was wearing a Trap Records shirt, a label owned by DTP member Titti Boi, the feud progressed. T.I. later recorded a song, 'Stomp', with G-Unit rapper Young Buck originally featuring Lil Jon. T.I.'s verse seemed like an insult to Ludacris and Young Buck did not want to be a part of it. Young Buck told Ludacris about this and Ludacris decided to get on the same song and insult T.I.
T.I.'s verse was omitted from the original track listing and replaced with The Game, though the version of the song with T.I.'s verse is still available on many file-sharing networks.
T.I. referenced this in his song &quot;I'm Talkin' to You&quot; on King:

&quot;Had it out with 'Cris but he still my nigga / Sat down, civilized, talked about it like niggas.&quot;

This served to eliminate Ludacris as a target of the song, which many believe to be directed toward Rick Ross. T.I. revealed that he wasn't talking about anyone, he just made the record to see whoever has a problem with him so they can speak out. Ludacris and T.I. squashed their beef. They been seen greeting each other on &quot;MTV My Block: Atlanta&quot; and both won two Grammys each.
Lil Flip
He was also engaged in a high-profile battle with Houston rapper Lil Flip, who he heard insulted him on stage at a concert in Atlanta while he was incarcerated. T.I. believed that Flip mocked his claim as the &quot;King of the South&quot;. Apparently, T.I. only learned of the alleged insult through a friend of T.I.'s girlfriend. T.I. says he heard from several sources, and even has a tape, of Flip insulting him at a few Atlanta concerts. Flip's alleged treason supposedly happened when T.I. was locked away in jail in spring. Lil Flip is said to have asked different audiences who the king of the South was before telling the crowd to inform hometown hero T.I. that &quot;the game was over.&quot; T.I. says he heard this was followed by the Houston rapper performing &quot;Game Over.&quot;
The members of his clique were holding up old publicity shots of Lil' Flip dressed in a leprechaun outfit. One picture has Flip holding a bowl of Lucky Charms cereal, the other one has Flipper in a fighting stance. Both flicks have been blown up to poster-size and copied several times.
The two released numerous insults on mixtapes and on the radio. UGK's own Pimp C mentioned in his song &quot;Knocking Doors Down&quot; that Lil Flip and T.I. are acting like &quot;little boys&quot; and they needed to squash their beef.
According to website,&lt;ref name&quot;&quot;&gt; T.I. and Lil Flip had an altercation at Lil Flip's hometown Cloverland. It has been said that T.I. went there to create a DVD exposing Lil Flip to be a fraud. The same day T.I. went on a Houston radio station talking about the altercation. He revealed that he had the tape and he was going to release it with an upcoming mixtape, but that didn't happened due to the fact that J. Prince stopped him for distributing the tape. It is unknown that T.I. still has the tape or not. The feud was squashed by Rap-A-Lot's J. Prince after having them to sit down and squash their beef behind closed doors. The feud was documented by the Houston Press.&lt;ref name&quot;&quot;&gt;
T.I. released a mixtape titled &quot;Down With the King&quot; featuring several tracks insulting Flip directly. Including a track titled 99 Problems Freestyle. The entire song is devoted to making fun of Flip and dissing him. The chorus of the track is even &quot;I got 99 problems, Lil' Flip ain't one.&quot;
On T.I.'s album King, there are several tracks which have been disputed by the hip hop community to be shots at Lil Flip (&quot;What You Know&quot;, &quot;You Know Who&quot; and &quot;I'm Talkin to You&quot;). In an interview with a popular online hip hop website on March 24, 2006, T.I. was quoted as saying he and Lil Flip have no beef. This is somewhat contradictory to the events that occurred during Young Dro's video &quot;Shoulder Lean&quot;. As Young Dro delivers the line &quot;Lucky Charm Diamonds, but nah, I ain't Flip&quot;. T.I. is seen making a laughing gesture towards the video camera. The beef seems to be squashed as Flip said in a recent freestyle:

&quot;How much money you got, nigga, what's in your vault/talk the talk, walk the walk, Rest in Peace to Big Hawk/ and Fat Pat/got a blue car and a black 'lac/used to wear throwbacks, but now that's played out/put my name in a verse, you get yo ass laid out/so don't talk about Flip no mo/and no I ain't got beef with Tip no mo&quot;.

Community work
T.I. has stepped up his community involvement as well, taking the lead on several initiatives to help the victims devastated by Hurricane Katrina, including personally donating $50,000 to the relief effort while leading an on-air Labor Day pledge drive on Atlanta's V-103 FM that raised over $263,000 for Mississippi rapper David Banner's &quot;Heal the Hood&quot; Foundation. He also partnered with David Banner and Atlanta newcomer Young Jeezy for a two-day food and clothing drive at Atlanta's Club Vision and co-headlined a massive benefit concert on September 17, sharing the bill with heavyweights such as Nelly, OutKast's Big Boi, and David Banner - with 100 percent of the proceeds going to &quot;Heal the Hood&quot;.
In addition to his Hurricane Katrina relief efforts, T.I. worked with troubled youths at Paulding Detention Center in Atlanta, provided scholarships for single parent families at Boys and Girls Clubs, and headlined Boost Mobile's RockCorps concert at New York's Radio City Music Hall, which featured such performers as Fat Joe, Slim Thug, and Kanye West, and was held exclusively for community service volunteers. In June 2005, The Lisa &quot;Left Eye&quot; Lopes Foundation, named for the deceased member of multi-platinum female group TLC, and Atlanta's V-103 honored T.I. with the 2005 Lisa Lopes Award for groundbreaking achievements in music and community service which was court ordered. With this steady list of growing accomplishments T.I. is being recognized as the &quot;Jay-Z of the South.&quot; according to Pharrell Williams of multi-platinum production team The Neptunes.&lt;ref name&quot;&quot;&gt;.
T.I. has joined forces again with the Make-A-Wish foundation to grant an Orlando teen's wish. He joined labelmate/protege' Young Dro on stage for a taping at The Showtime At The Apollo to meet 15 year old Sara Labare on October 15 at the Apollo Theatre. Labare, who suffers from an autoimmune disorder, received a digital camera,an autographed poster, CDs, and sat in the front row during T.I.'s performance. T.I. has granted a total of 3 wishes.
T.I. kept a fan smiling when he showed up at 11-year-old Ajmal Acklin's, who suffers from acute lymblastic leukemia with Christmas gifts. Hot-107.9 announcer Griff asked the 11 year old does he like T.I. and Acklin responded &quot;Yes&quot; and his favorite song was &quot;What You Know&quot;. Griff told him that T.I. was here and the 11-year-old's eyes lit up. T.I. walked in and said: &quot;How you doing, I just wanted to come see how you're doing ... I heard the church bought you a PlayStation 3, so I got you some games&quot;. One by one, each visitor offered their prayers and well wishes, ending with A-Team intern Ree Williams doing a stirring a capella version of the gospel tune &quot;Even Me&quot;. Before she hit the last note Ajmal's mom ducked into the kitchen, tears in her eyes.
T.I.'s King Foundation is also scheduled to donate 10,000 bikes to the Boys &amp; Girls Club in New Orleans.
T.I.'s night club, Club Crucial, where he and V-103 announcer Greg Street will give away 200 bicycles to neighborhood children in the Boys &amp; Girls Club.&lt;ref name&quot;&quot;&gt;
Personal life
Family
T.I. was dating Tameka &quot;Tiny&quot; Cottle from the 90's group Xscape. They have a son together named Clifford aka 'King' and were expecting a daughter (Llayah Amour) to be born in June who died at stillbirth late night on March 21, 2007. Tiny also has another daughter Zonnique that T.I. claims. He has 3 other children, their names are Messiah Harris (son), Domani Harris (son), and Deyjah Harris (daughter). T.I. and Tiny ended their longterm relationship on March 18, 2007.4
Criminal
In early 2004, T.I. was behind bars in Cobb County, Georgia, for violating probation. The probation stems from a November 1997 arrest and subsequent conviction for distribution of cocaine, manufacturing and distributing a controlled substance, and giving authorities a false name, according to a sheriff's department spokesperson.
He served a sentence of unknown length and was released early on probation. It is not clear what he did to violate the terms of his release, but it is the second time he's been accused of doing so. A county judge could revoke the terms of his probation and reinstate his original sentence.
More trouble awaits T.I. in neighboring Fulton County. Two arrest warrants were issued there in March &lt;U+2014&gt; one for possession of a firearm and one for possession of ecstasy. Now that he's in custody, T.I. will likely be extradited to face those charges after his case is handled in Cobb County, according to a Fulton County sheriff's department spokesperson.&lt;ref name&quot;&quot;&gt;
T.I. was sentenced to three years in prison for violating the terms of his probation. After serving a minimum of one year, T.I. can apply for a work-release program, according to the county clerk's office in Cobb County, Georgia. An arrest warrant for T.I. was issued on December 29, ordering a revocation of his probation. He turned himself in to county officials on March 30 and had been in custody ever since. His lawyers appeared in Cobb County Superior Court Wednesday and signed a consent order with prosecutors that essentially stipulated T.I. should be sentenced immediately, thus avoiding the need for a formal hearing.
T.I. was on probation stemming from a 1998 conviction for violating a state controlled substances act and for giving false information. After being released on probation, he earned a litany of probation violations in several counties around Georgia for offenses ranging from possession of a firearm to possession of marijuana.&lt;ref name&quot;&quot;&gt;.
In 2006, after appearing in an Atlanta court on (May 10) and having charges that he threatened a man outside a strip club last year dropped for lack of evidence, T.I. was arrested on an outstanding probation violation warrant from Florida. The warrant claims that T.I. did not complete the required number of community service hours he was sentenced for a 2003 assault of a female sheriff deputy at University Mall in Tampa. T.I. was detained by several mall Security Guards at the time of the incident, among them, Jason Phillips(founder of Certified Protective Services), Larry Warner (founder of Tactical Response Services), and Arturo Ortiz, now a security manager in Florida. According to WBS-TV Atlanta, the rapper&lt;U+2019&gt;s attorney has said that the problem was nothing more than a &lt;U+201C&gt;technical matter&lt;U+201D&gt; between Georgia and Florida. The confusion arose because T.I. was also sentenced to community service in Georgia for driving with a suspended license, for which he did complete 75 hours of community service in his home state. The rapper was released on bail shortly after being arrested, and was expected to surrender to Florida state authorities next week to resolve the matter.&lt;ref name&quot;&quot;&gt;
Death of T.I.'s friend and assistant
In the early hours of May 3, 2006, T.I. and his entourage were involved in a gunfight after leaving a concert after-party at the Club Ritz, a nightclub in Cincinnati, Ohio&lt;ref name&quot;&quot;&gt; that has a history of problems with the law. Four members of T.I.'s entourage were shot in the altercation. T.I.'s personal assistant Philant Johnson was killed and Janice Gillespie was seriously wounded by the gunfire.&lt;ref name&quot;&quot;&gt; It is believed that the altercation began at the Ritz when members of T.I.'s entourage threw money into the crowd, angering male audience members.
According to the Cincinnati Enquirer, the feud began at the city's Club Ritz during an after-party for the Atlanta rapper and his protege Young Dro -- who performed earlier that evening at the club Bogart's -- and moved outside, where shots were fired into two vans transporting T.I.'s crew just after three o'clock.
&quot;[The money] was supposed to be for the ladies&quot;, one witness said. &quot;But it was hitting guys in the face, and they were like, 'We had money before, so why are you throwing money at us?'&quot;
When the situation grew tense, T.I. reportedly told his group to head out. A witness outside told the Enquirer that one shot -- believed to be unrelated to the ensuing gun battle -- was fired in the parking lot and at least four people followed the vans in a large vehicle. The person that died was T.I.'s personal assistant and best friend Philant Johnson.
