Robert G. Terzuola is an American knife maker who popularized the type of knife known as the Tactical Folder.1
Early life
Terzuola was born in Brooklyn, New York and attended New York University. Upon graduation in 1967 he went to Panama as a Peace Corps trainer2 and later became a jade carver and gemologist in the Motagua valley, Guatemala.3 By 1979, Terzuola began making knives and in 1981 joined the Knifemakers' Guild on an endorsement from Bob Loveless.
Knifemaking
Terzuola's first knives were fixed blade designs, made for soldiers in Guatemala. In 1981 he relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico and began making folding knives. Seeing a need for a knife that could be carried discreetly he developed a model using black micarta for the scales and bead-blasted titanium bolsters; for this effort he coined the term &quot;Tactical Knife&quot;.4
Terzuola has authored a book about the design of tactical knives and has authored articles about tactical knives and knifemaking for Blade, Soldier of Fortune and other publications. In 2006 he relocated his shop to Albuquerque, New Mexico.5
Terzuola has collaborated with other knifemakers and production companies including Spyderco, Strider Knives, and Microtech Knives.67 8
