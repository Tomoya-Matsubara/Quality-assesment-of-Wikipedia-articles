He failed in his 1960 bid to win a seat in the Saskatchewan legislature but won a by-election two years later and retained his seat in the 1964 provincial election that brought the Thatcher Liberals to power.4
Steuart was appointed Minister of Health in the provincial cabinet implementing the government's system of user fees for health care and, in 1965, became Minister of Natural Resources and Deputy Premier. In 1967, he became Minister of Finance.5
Stueart's budgets were blamed for the Liberal Party's defeat in the 1971 provincial election. Nevertheless, Stueart was elected party leader in December 1971 following Thatcher's death. He served as Leader of the Opposition for four years resigning the party leadership two days after the 1975 provincial election in which the party was badly defeated.6
