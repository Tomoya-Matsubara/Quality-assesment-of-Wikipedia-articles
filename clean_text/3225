Praskvica Monastery () is a Serbian Orthodox monastery in &lt;U+010C&gt;elobrdo, a village in Budva municipality in modern-day Montenegro. It was spiritual and political center of Pa&lt;U+0161&gt;trovi&lt;U+0107&gt;i. The name of monastery is taken from the peach-scented water of the nearby spring (praskva, diminutive praskvica means little peach).1
Establishment
According to the some stories the monastery was founded in 1050 while it is recorded in the written documents in 1307.2 That document is a charter Stephen Uro&lt;U+0161&gt; II Milutin of Serbia issued during his visit to Kotor in which he confirms to the Church of the Holy Trinity the ownership over some villages granted to the church by his mother Helen of Anjou.3
Churches
Six churches belong to Praskvica Monastery.
Two churches are within the complex of this monastery. The older church is dedicated to the Holy Trinity while the other, built by Bal&lt;U+0161&gt;a III and his mother Jelena4 in 1413, is dedicated to Saint Nicholas.56 The church was built in the Ra&lt;U+0161&gt;ka architectural school style.7 In the same year a small house was built near the church.8 After the church was reconstructed in 1847 only a part of one wall of the original church building remained.9
There are four churches on Sveti Stefan that also belong to Praskvica Monastery. One of them was destroyed by the communists and turned into casino.10 Some of its icons were painted in 1681 by the painter whose name was Radul.11 According to some stories, the cross of Emperor Du&lt;U+0161&gt;an is kept in this monastery.12
Jegor Stroganov
There is a popular story about Jegor Stroganov, an one-armed Russian military officer who lived in Praskvica Monastery as a monk at the end of 18th and beginning of 19th century. According to this story he came to Praskvica at the end of 18th century and became a monk in Praskvica Monastery and pledged for silence.13 At the beginning of 19th century he alone built 3 kilometer stone road from Sveti Stefan to the monastery after 10 years of building.14 This road has been named Jegor's road after Jegor Stroganov.15 A drama titled &quot;Jegor's road&quot;, written by Serbian playwright Vida Ognjenovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, is inspired with the story about Jegor.16
