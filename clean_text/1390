Concert synopsis
Main The Beyonc Experience
Onstage Knowles had an all-female band, and the show used men only as dancers for the female audience as noted by Pareles of The New York Times. The show included many references such as to James Brown and Donna Summer as well as routines inspired by Sweet Charity and Marilyn Monroe. It opened in darkness with Knowles emerging through a hole in the stage amidst smoke, sparkles and pyrotechnics to perform Crazy in Love Beyonc Knowles song Crazy in Love and a snippet of Gnarls Barkley's Crazy Gnarls Barkley song Crazy in a sparkling silver gown and walked to the front of the stage,cite web  url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1566431/beyonce-puts-on-flawless-8212-fallless-8212-nyc-show.jhtml  title=Beyonce Puts On Flawless  And Fall-Less  NYC Show With Robin Thicke  first=Shaheem  last=Reid  publisher=MTV News.

At the top of the staircase/mini-stage, she tore off the bottom of her dress and walked back down to the main stage. Her three backup singers came down as well and did the uh-oh dance from the song with her.

The intro to Ring the Alarm paid homage to the Cell Block Tango from the film Chicago 2002 film Chicago, as women told of how they had been hurt by men and the performance saw Knowles wearing a red overcoat. During the performance of Suga Mama, Knowles performed a pole dance. Afterwards Knowles' duets with Jay-Z - Upgrade U and '03 Bonnie & Clyde were performed. During Get Me Bodied she removed her robot costume to reveal black and yellow dress to emulate a bee and further led the crowd in a dance routine. Check on It was preceded by an instrumental of The Pink Panther Theme, during which the stairs were colored pink. A Dreamgirls film Dreamgirls segment was performed, incorporating the title song and Listen from the 2006 musical film in which Knowles starred in. The final song on the tour's set list was Irreplaceable; it began with the audience singing the first verse to Knowles after she announced I've been singing my heart out for over two hours. Now it's time for you to sing for me. Between segments of the show, Suga Mama performed periodic instrumental interludes, with every member giving a solo so Knowles could change her costumes seven times.cite web  url=http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Beyonce-takes-over-the-Oracle-Arena-2543128.php  title=Beyonc takes over the Oracle Arena  first=Lee  last=Hildebrand  work=San Francisco Chronicle  publisher=Hearst Corporation  date=September 3, 2007  accessdate=April 28, 2011 The show included a ten-song Destiny's Child Medley which contained female solidarity-themed songs.

Neal Medlyn re-enactment
Performer Neal Medlyn re-enacted the DVD during his performance at the New Museum in April 2008 together with dancers Will Rawls and Erick Montes. His performance was one-hour long and it was titled The Neal Medlyn Experience Live. He sang along to the DVD audio track, complete with word-for-word between-song patter and band introductions and the like.cite web url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/06/review_the_neal_medlyn_experie.html title=Review: The Neal Medlyn Experience Live publisher=Booth Newspapers. Advance Publications first=Roger last=LeLeivre date=June 18, 2009 accessdate=August 5, 2013 Booth Newspapers' Roger LeLeivre reviewed the re-enactment positively writing, The event... was a hoot, and the audience loved every second of it. Medlyn has Beyonce's signature, often spastic, moves down pat, down to each minute hand gesture and facial expression... Unlike a drag show, Medlyn does not try to convince anyone they are seeing Beyonce. There wasn't much in the way of costumes well, he did enter in a black wig, tube top and hot pants, but those bit the dust rather quickly, and why bother?. He concluded that the length of the show was perfect as it ended before the shtick wore out its welcome. LeLeivre finished his review by writing, It was a delicious pop-culture skewering, right down to the back-up dancers, with their over-the-top moves and expressions... Clearly it enhanced the 'experience,' if you had a passing acquaintance with Beyonce's songs... but such knowledge was not a prerequisite to enjoying this homage. Claudia La Rocco of The New York Times described his re-enactment as absurdly faithful and added that it wouldn't have been nearly as smart or touching without the dancing of Rawls and Montes. She further put the performance in her list of the richest moments of 2008 and noted, These astounding performers slipped between genders and among genres, enveloping Mr. Medlyn in utter fabulousness and proving just how sophisticated pop culture can be. Backup dancers everywhere should feel proud.cite web url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/arts/dance/21laro.html?_r=0 title=Perhaps Not Fully Polished, but Jewels Nonetheless work=The New York Times publisher=The New York Times Company first=Claudia last=La Rocco date=December 21, 2008 accessdate=May 24, 2013
