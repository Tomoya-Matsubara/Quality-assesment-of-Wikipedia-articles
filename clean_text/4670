Tibet during the Tang Dynasty is a article on Tibet during the rule of the Tang Dynasty. Chinese and Tibetan forces had captured each others capitals during this period, and forced each other to pay tribute.  Around 650 AD, the Chinese Tang Dynasty captured Lhasa. The Tibetans managed to capture Chang'an in 763 during the midst of the Anshi Rebellion, which saw Tang China devastated by a massive Turkic uprising. However, the incursion was soon defeated.1
The Old Book of Tang recorded the first ever embassy from Tibet arrived in China from Songts&lt;U+00E4&gt;n Gampo in the 8th Zhenguan year or 634 CE.2 Tang dynasty chronicles describe this as a tribute mission, but it brought an ultimatum demanding a marriage alliance, not subservient rituals. After this demand was refused, Tibet launched victorious military attacks against Tang affiliates in 637 and 638.3
There is some confusion as to whether Central Tibet conquered Zhang Zhung during the reign of Songts&lt;U+00E4&gt;n Gampo or in the reign of Trisong Dets&lt;U+00E4&gt;n, (r. 755 until 797 or 804 CE).4 The records of the Tang Annals do, however, seem to clearly place these events in the reign of Songts&lt;U+00E4&gt;n Gampo for they say that in 634, Yangtong (Zhang Zhung) and various Qiang tribes &quot;altogether submitted to him.&quot; Following this he united with the country of Yangtong to defeat the 'Azha or Tuyuhun, and then conquered two more tribes of Qiang before threatening Songzhou with an army of (according to the Chinese) more than 200,000 men (100,000 according to Tibetan sources).5 He then sent an envoy with gifts of gold and silk to the Chinese emperor to ask for a Chinese princess in marriage and, when refused, attacked Songzhou. According to the Tang Annals, he finally retreated and apologised and later the emperor granted his request,67
