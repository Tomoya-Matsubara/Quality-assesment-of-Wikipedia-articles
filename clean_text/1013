History
The land that is now Keansburg was originally home to the Lenni Lenape Native Americans. 
On September 3, 1609, the Half Moon, captained by Henry Hudson is said to have landed on the shores of present-day Keansburg (though some historians argue that the landing and forth-coming explained events took place at the tip of Sandy Hook). Crewmen of the ship were attacked by the Native Americans when they departed the ship, and one man, John Coleman, was killed.2 He is reputed to be the first European to be felled by a Native American arrow. It is said that he was buried on the land, in the area that is today the intersection of Carr Avenue and Beachway. It is referred to as &quot;Coleman's Point&quot;
In the time between 1609 and the early 1700s, the land was gradually purchased from the Lenni-Lenape with other surrounding areas. The area was inhabited by Dutch, English, and Scottish settlers. In the 1700s, farming proved to be successful on Keansburg's land, with specialties being pears, apples and corn (maize). 
In this time, the town took on the name of Waackaack, pronounced &quot;Way-kay-ack.&quot; This is a Lenape Native American term, originally &quot;Wakioak&quot; meaning &quot;Land of Plenty&quot;.3 The area was also widely known as Tanner's Landing from the early 1700s until approximately 1820, so named for the pier at the end of what was Tanner's Landing Road (now Main Street). Tanner's Landing was a principal port for the area for many years.4
Though the source of this information does not state exactly when, the land took on its second official name of Granville. The name originated from the importance of the Phillips Mill, and the grain producing farms in the region. The name held until 1880s.
During the century, Granville became home to its own church, two lighthouses and small businesses. Roadways were beginning to form from repeated use of horse and buggies. The beach was already a favorite to visitors. Population was about 300 people, who mostly farmed and clammed for a living.
On Sunday, March 22, 1877, at &quot;half past 9 o'clock,&quot; Granville welcomed the newly assigned pastor of the Granville Methodist Episcopal Church, William W. Ramsay. At 19 years of age, Ramsay was slated to serve in the church for one year. His success at the helm of church led to another year in Granville, after which he decided to make the village his permanent home.
Ramsay and his wife, Eliza S Wood, purchased the land that is 69 Church Street and opened a general store in 1881. In the coming years, Ramsay took greater and greater interest in Granville and eventually arranged a petition to establish a post office. The list of 132 names was passed on to John Kean of Elizabeth, a candidate for Congress. His efforts led to the opening of the post office in 1884, with Mrs. Ramsay serving as its first postmaster. That year, the name Keansburg was adopted.
Further development continued with the creation of postcards depicting the village and land purchases, including some key buys by William A. Gehlhaus and the Keansburg Beach Company. A school was built at the cost of $30,000 in 1890 and sat on what is today the corner of Ramsay Avenue and Church Street (now Fallon Manor).
 After the town's decline, small beach houses were cheaply sold and converted into year-round housing. Efforts to reduce crime seem to be working, slowly but surely, in many areas. Further evidence of a possible comeback include the Keansburg beautification project, building of new condominiums across the street from the boardwalk, the construction of a skateboard park, the hiring of a part-time recreation program director and the opening of the first free-standing public library in the borough. The Keansburg Waterfront Public Library, founded in 2004, is the result of a concerted effort on the part of townspeople and the borough government to provide a high quality library with resources that address the needs and interests of the community. Currently, the library is open on a limited basis and is staffed by a part-time library director, library assistant and two additional part-time pages. In spite of this, the library has seen an overwhelmingly positive response from patrons in the community.
