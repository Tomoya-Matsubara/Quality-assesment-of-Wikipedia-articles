 The York City Clubman of the Year award is voted for annually by York City's supporters in recognition of the best overall performance by an individual player throughout the football season.1 Fans make their choice through the use of voting forms, which are handed out at KitKat Crescent towards the end of each season.2 As a mark of respect, the trophy is named the Billy Fenton Memorial Trophy, after player Billy Fenton, who died suddenly in 1973.3 The award is presented before the final game of the season by Fenton's widow, Margot Fenton.45
Since the inaugural award was made to Phil Burrows in 1974, six players have won the award twice, most recently goalkeeper Alan Fettis in 2001 and 2002.6 Gordon Staniforth was the first to win the trophy in consecutive seasons, a feat since emulated by defenders John MacPhail and Barry Jones and Fettis.7 One winner has gone on to manage the club, Chris Brass, the winner of the 2003 award, in 2003–04.8
