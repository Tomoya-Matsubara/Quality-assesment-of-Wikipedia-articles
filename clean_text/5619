The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith was founded by Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h in 19th-century Persia. Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h was exiled for his teachings, from Persia to the Ottoman Empire, and died while officially being a prisoner. After Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's death, under the leadership of his son, `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;, the religion spread from its Persian and Ottoman roots, and gained a footing in Europe and America, and was consolidated in Iran, where it suffers intense persecution.4 After the death of `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;, the leadership of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; community entered a new phase, evolving from a single individual to an administrative order with both elected bodies and appointed individuals.5 There are probably more than 5 million Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s around the world in more than 200 countries and territories.67
In the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith, religious history is seen to have unfolded through a series of divine messengers, each of whom established a religion that was suited to the needs of the time and the capacity of the people. These messengers have included Abrahamic figures as well as Dharmic ones - Krishna, Moses, Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, and others. For Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s, the most recent messengers are the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b and Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h. In Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; belief, each consecutive messenger prophesied of messengers to follow, and Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's life and teachings fulfilled the end-time promises of previous scriptures. Humanity is understood to be in a process of collective evolution, and the need of the present time is for the gradual establishment of peace, justice and unity on a global scale.8
Etymology
The word Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+202F&gt; is used either as an adjective to refer to the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith or as a term for a follower of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h. The word is not a noun meaning the religion as a whole.9 It is derived from the Arabic Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+202F&gt; (), meaning &quot;glory&quot; or &quot;splendor&quot;.10 The term &quot;Bahaism&quot; (or &quot;Baha'ism&quot;) has been used in the past, but the generally accepted name for the religion is the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith.1112
Beliefs
Three core principles establish a basis for Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; teachings and doctrine: the unity of God, the unity of religion, and the unity of humanity.13 From these postulates stems the belief that God periodically reveals his will through divine messengers, whose purpose is to transform the character of humankind and develop, within those who respond, moral and spiritual qualities. Religion is thus seen as orderly, unified, and progressive from age to age.14
God

 The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; writings describe a single, personal, inaccessible, omniscient, omnipresent, imperishable, and almighty God who is the creator of all things in the universe.15 The existence of God and the universe is thought to be eternal, without a beginning or end.16 Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of creation, with a will and purpose that is expressed through messengers termed Manifestations of God.1718
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; teachings state that God is too great for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a complete and accurate image of, by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations.1920 In the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; religion God is often referred to by titles and attributes (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on monotheism; such doctrines as the Trinity are seen as compromising, if not contradicting, the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; view that God is single and has no equal.21 The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; teachings state that the attributes which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping God to develop their potentialities on their spiritual path.2223 According to the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love God through such methods as prayer, reflection, and being of service to others.24 
Religion


Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; notions of progressive religious revelation result in their accepting the validity of most of the world's religions, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God. Religious history is interpreted as a series of dispensations, where each manifestation brings a somewhat broader and more advanced revelation, suited for the time and place in which it was expressed.25 Specific religious social teachings (for example, the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement for the time and place may be established. Conversely, certain general principles (for example, neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. In Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; belief, this process of progressive revelation will not end; however, it is believed to be cyclical. Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s do not expect a new manifestation of God to appear within 1000 years of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's revelation.26
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; beliefs are sometimes described as syncretic combinations of earlier religious beliefs.27 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s, however, assert that their religion is a distinct tradition with its own scriptures, teachings, laws, and history.2829 While the religion was initially seen as a sect of Islam, most religious specialists now see it as an independent religion, with its religious background in Shi'a Islam being seen as analogous to the Jewish context in which Christianity was established.30 Muslim institutions and clergy, both Sunni and Shia, consider Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s to be deserters or apostates from Islam, which has led to Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s being persecuted.3132 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s, themselves, describe their faith as an independent world religion, differing from the other traditions in its relative age and in the appropriateness of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's teachings to the modern context.33 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h is believed to have fulfilled the messianic expectations of these precursor faiths.34
Human beings
  The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; writings state that human beings have a &quot;rational soul&quot;, and that this provides the species with a unique capacity to recognize God's station and humanity's relationship with its creator. Every human is seen to have a duty to recognize God through His messengers, and to conform to their teachings.35 Through recognition and obedience, service to humanity and regular prayer and spiritual practice, the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; writings state that the soul becomes closer to God, the spiritual ideal in Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; belief. When a human dies, the soul passes into the next world, where its spiritual development in the physical world becomes a basis for judgment and advancement in the spiritual world. Heaven and Hell are taught to be spiritual states of nearness or distance from God that describe relationships in this world and the next, and not physical places of reward and punishment achieved after death.36 See Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith on life after death.
The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; writings emphasize the essential equality of human beings, and the abolition of prejudice. Humanity is seen as essentially one, though highly varied; its diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and acceptance. Doctrines of racism, nationalism, caste, social class, and gender-based hierarchy are seen as artificial impediments to unity.37 The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; teachings state that the unification of humanity is the paramount issue in the religious and political conditions of the present world.38
Teachings


Summary
Shoghi Effendi, the appointed head of the religion from 1921 to 1957, wrote the following summary of what he considered to be the distinguishing principles of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's teachings, which, he said, together with the laws and ordinances of the Kit&lt;U+00E1&gt;b-i-Aqdas constitute the bedrock of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith: 
Social principles
The following principles are frequently listed as a quick summary of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; teachings. They are derived from transcripts of speeches given by `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt; during his tour of Europe and North America in 1912.3940 The list is not authoritative and a variety of such lists circulate.414243

Unity of God
Unity of religion
Unity of humanity
Equality between men and women
Elimination of all forms of prejudice
World peace
Harmony of religion and science
Independent investigation of truth
Principle of Ever-Advancing Civilization
Universal compulsory education
Universal auxiliary language44
Obedience to government and non-involvement in partisan politics unless submission to law amounts to a denial of Faith.45
Elimination of extremes of wealth and poverty

With specific regard to the pursuit of world peace, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h prescribed a world-embracing collective security arrangement as necessary for the establishment of a lasting peace.46
Mystical teachings
Although the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; teachings have a strong emphasis on social and ethical issues, there exist a number of foundational texts that have been described as mystical.47 The Seven Valleys is considered Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's &quot;greatest mystical composition.&quot; It was written to a follower of Sufism, in the style of `Attar, a Muslim poet,48 and sets forth the stages of the soul's journey towards God. It was first translated into English in 1906, becoming one of the earliest available books of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h to the West. The Hidden Words is another book written by Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h during the same period, containing 153 short passages in which Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h claims to have taken the basic essence of certain spiritual truths and written them in brief form.49
Covenant

The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; teachings speak of both a &quot;Greater Covenant&quot;,50 being universal and endless, and a &quot;Lesser Covenant&quot;, being unique to each religious dispensation. The Lesser Covenant is viewed as an agreement between a Messenger of God and his followers and includes social practices and the continuation of authority in the religion. At this time Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s view Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's revelation as a binding lesser covenant for his followers; in the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; writings being firm in the covenant is considered a virtue to work toward.51 The Greater Covenant is viewed as a more enduring agreement between God and humanity, where a Manifestation of God is expected to come to humanity about every thousand years, at times of turmoil and uncertainty.
With unity as an essential teaching of the religion, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s follow an administration they believe is divinely ordained, and therefore see attempts to create schisms and divisions as efforts that are contrary to the teachings of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h. Schisms have occurred over the succession of authority, but any Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; divisions have had relatively little success and have failed to attract a sizeable following.52 The followers of such divisions are regarded as Covenant-breakers and shunned, essentially excommunicated.5354
Canonical texts

The canonical texts are the writings of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h, `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;, Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, and the authenticated talks of `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;. The writings of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b and Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h are considered as divine revelation, the writings and talks of `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt; and the writings of Shoghi Effendi as authoritative interpretation, and those of the Universal House of Justice as authoritative legislation and elucidation. Some measure of divine guidance is assumed for all of these texts.55 Some of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's most important writings include the Kit&lt;U+00E1&gt;b-i-Aqdas, literally the Most Holy Book, which is his book of laws,56 the Kit&lt;U+00E1&gt;b-i-&lt;U+00CD&gt;q&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, literally the Book of Certitude, which became the foundation of much of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; belief,57 the Gems of Divine Mysteries, which includes further doctrinal foundations, and the Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys which are mystical treatises.58

Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; history follows a sequence of leaders, beginning with the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b's May 23, 1844 declaration in Shiraz, Iran, and ultimately resting on an administrative order established by the central figures of the religion. The Bahai community was mostly confined to the Persian and Ottoman empires until after the death of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h in 1892, at which time he had followers in 13 countries of Asia and Africa.59 Under the leadership of his son, `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;, the religion gained a footing in Europe and America, and was consolidated in Iran, where it still suffers intense persecution.60 After the death of `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt; in 1921, the leadership of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; community entered a new phase, evolving from a single individual to an administrative order with both elected bodies and appointed individuals.61
The B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b

 On May 23, 1844 Siyyid `Al&lt;U+00ED&gt;-Muhammad of Shiraz, Iran proclaimed that he was &quot;the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&quot; ( &quot;the Gate&quot;), referring to his later claim to the station of Mahdi, the Twelfth Imam of Shi`a Islam.62 His followers were therefore known as B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s. As the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b's teachings spread, which the Islamic clergy saw as a threat, his followers came under increased persecution and torture.63 The conflicts escalated in several places to military sieges by the Shah's army. The B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b himself was imprisoned and eventually executed in 1850.64
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s see the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b as the forerunner of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith, because the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b's writings introduced the concept of &quot;He whom God shall make manifest&quot;, a Messianic figure whose coming, according to Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s, was announced in the scriptures of all of the world's great religions, and whom Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h, the founder of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith, claimed to be in 1863.65 The B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b's tomb, located in Haifa, Israel, is an important place of pilgrimage for Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s. The remains of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b were brought secretly from Iran to the Holy Land and eventually interred in the tomb built for them in a spot specifically designated by Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h.66
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h

M&lt;U+00ED&gt;rz&lt;U+00E1&gt; Husayn `Al&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00FA&gt;r&lt;U+00ED&gt; was one of the early followers of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b, and later took the title of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h. He was arrested and imprisoned for this involvement in 1852. Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h relates that in 1853, while incarcerated in the dungeon of the S&lt;U+00ED&gt;y&lt;U+00E1&gt;h-Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;l in Tehran, he received the first intimations that he was the one anticipated by the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b.67
Shortly thereafter he was expelled from Tehran to Baghdad, in the Ottoman Empire;68 then to Constantinople (now Istanbul); and then to Adrianople (now Edirne). In 1863, at the time of his banishment from Baghdad to Constantinople, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h declared his claim to a divine mission to his family and followers. Tensions then grew between him and Subh-i-Azal, the appointed leader of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s who did not recognize Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's claim. Throughout the rest of his life Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h gained the allegiance of most of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s, who came to be known as Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s. Beginning in 1866, he began declaring his mission as a Messenger of God in letters to the world's religious and secular rulers, including Pope Pius IX, Napoleon III, and Queen Victoria.
In 1868 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h was banished by Sultan Abd&lt;U+00FC&gt;l&lt;U+00E2&gt;ziz a final time to the Ottoman penal colony of `Akk&lt;U+00E1&gt;, in present-day Israel.69 Towards the end of his life, the strict and harsh confinement was gradually relaxed, and he was allowed to live in a home near `Akk&lt;U+00E1&gt;, while still officially a prisoner of that city.70 He died there in 1892. Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s regard his resting place at Bahj&lt;U+00ED&gt; as the Qiblih to which they turn in prayer each day.71
`Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;

`Abb&lt;U+00E1&gt;s Effendi was Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's eldest son, known by the title of `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt; (Servant of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;). His father left a Will that appointed `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt; as the leader of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; community, and designated him as the &quot;Centre of the Covenant&quot;, &quot;Head of the Faith&quot;, and the sole authoritative interpreter of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's writings.7273 `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt; had shared his father's long exile and imprisonment, which continued until `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'s own release as a result of the Young Turk Revolution in 1908. Following his release he led a life of travelling, speaking, teaching, and maintaining correspondence with communities of believers and individuals, expounding the principles of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith.74
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; administration

Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's Kit&lt;U+00E1&gt;b-i-Aqdas and The Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt; are foundational documents of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; administrative order. Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h established the elected Universal House of Justice, and `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt; established the appointed hereditary Guardianship and clarified the relationship between the two institutions.7576 In his Will, `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt; appointed his eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, as the first Guardian of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith, serving as head of the religion until his death, for 36 years.77
Shoghi Effendi throughout his lifetime translated Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; texts; developed global plans for the expansion of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; community; developed the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; World Centre; carried on a voluminous correspondence with communities and individuals around the world; and built the administrative structure of the religion, preparing the community for the election of the Universal House of Justice.78 He died in 1957 under conditions that did not allow for a successor to be appointed.7980
At local, regional, and national levels, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s elect members to nine-person Spiritual Assemblies, which run the affairs of the religion. There are also appointed individuals working at various levels, including locally and internationally, which perform the function of propagating the teachings and protecting the community. The latter do not serve as clergy, which the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith does not have.8182 The Universal House of Justice, first elected in 1963, remains the successor and supreme governing body of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith, and its 9 members are elected every five years by the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies.83 Any male Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;, 21 years or older, is eligible to be elected to the Universal House of Justice; all other positions are open to male and female Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s.84
International plans
 In 1937, Shoghi Effendi launched a seven-year plan for the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s of North America, followed by another in 1946.85 In 1953, he launched the first international plan, the Ten Year World Crusade. This plan included extremely ambitious goals for the expansion of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; communities and institutions, the translation of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; texts into several new languages, and the sending of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; pioneers into previously unreached nations.86 He announced in letters during the Ten Year Crusade that it would be followed by other plans under the direction of the Universal House of Justice, which was elected in 1963 at the culmination of the Crusade. The House of Justice then launched a nine-year plan in 1964, and a series of subsequent multi-year plans of varying length and goals followed, guiding the direction of the international Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; community.87
Annually, on April 21, the Universal House of Justice sends a &lt;U+2018&gt;Ridv&lt;U+00E1&gt;n&lt;U+2019&gt; message to the worldwide Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt; community,88 which generally gives an update on the progress made concerning the current plan, and provides further guidance for the year to come.89 The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s around the world are currently being encouraged to focus on capacity building through children's classes, youth groups, devotional gatherings, and a systematic study of the religion known as study circles.9091 Further focuses are involvement in social action and participation in the prevalent discourses of society.9293 The years from 2001 until 2021 represent four successive five-year plans, culminating in the centennial anniversary of the passing of `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;.94

thumb|alt=A large temple in the shape of an open lotus flower|upright=1.25|The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; House of Worship in New Delhi, India attracts an average of 4 million visitors a year. It is popularly known as the Lotus Temple. A Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; published document reported 4.74 million Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s in 1986 growing at a rate of 4.4%.95 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; sources since 1991 usually estimate the worldwide Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; population to be above 5 million.96 The World Christian Encyclopedia estimated 7.1 million Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s in the world in 2000, representing 218 countries,97 and 7.3 million in 201098 with the same source. They further state: &quot;The Baha'i Faith is the only religion to have grown faster in every United Nations region over the past 100 years than the general population; Baha&lt;U+2019&gt;i was thus the fastest-growing religion between 1910 and 2010, growing at least twice as fast as the population of almost every UN region.&quot;99 This source's only systematic flaw was to consistently have a higher estimate of Christians than other cross-national data sets.100
From its origins in the Persian and Ottoman Empires, by the early 20th century there were a number of converts in South and South East Asia, Europe, and North America. During the 1950s and 1960s, vast travel teaching efforts brought the religion to almost every country and territory of the world. By the 1990s, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s were developing programs for systematic consolidation on a large scale, and the early 21st century saw large influxes of new adherents around the world. The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith is currently the largest religious minority in Iran,101 Panama,102 and Belize;103 the second largest international religion in Bolivia,104 Zambia,105 and Papua New Guinea;106 and the third largest international religion in Chad107108 and Kenya.109 According to The World Almanac and Book of Facts 2004: 
The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; religion was listed in The Britannica Book of the Year (1992&lt;U+2013&gt;present) as the second most widespread of the world's independent religions in terms of the number of countries represented. According to Britannica, the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith (as of 2002) is established in 247 countries and territories; represents over 2,100 ethnic, racial, and tribal groups; has scriptures translated into over 800 languages; and has an estimated seven million adherents worldwide.110 Additionally, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s have self-organized in most of the nations of the world.
The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; religion was ranked by the FP magazine as the world's second fastest growing religion by percentage (1.7%) in 2007.111
Social practices
Laws

 The laws of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith primarily come from the Kit&lt;U+00E1&gt;b-i-Aqdas, written by Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h.112 The following are a few examples of basic laws and religious observances.

Prayer in the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith consists of obligatory prayer and devotional (general) prayer. Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s over the age of 15 must individually recite an obligatory prayer each day, using fixed words and form. In addition to the daily obligatory prayer, believers are directed to daily offer devotional prayer and to meditate and study sacred scripture. There is no set form for devotions and meditations, though the devotional prayers written by the central figures of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith and collected in prayer books are held in high esteem. Reading aloud of prayers from prayer books is a typical feature of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; gatherings.
Backbiting and gossip are prohibited and denounced.
Adult Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s in good health should observe a nineteen-day sunrise-to-sunset fast each year from March 2 through March 20.
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s are forbidden to drink alcohol or to take drugs, unless prescribed by doctors.
Sexual intercourse is only permitted between a husband and wife, and thus premarital, extramarital and homosexual intercourse are forbidden. (See also Homosexuality and the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith)
Gambling is forbidden.
Fanaticism is forbidden.
Adherence to ritual is discouraged, with the notable exception of the obligatory prayers.
Abstaining from partisan politics is required.

While some of the laws from the Kit&lt;U+00E1&gt;b-i-Aqdas are applicable at the present time and may be enforced to a degree by the administrative institutions,113 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h has provided for the progressive application of other laws that are dependent upon the existence of a predominantly Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; society. The laws, when not in direct conflict with the civil laws of the country of residence, are binding on every Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;,114 and the observance of personal laws, such as prayer or fasting, is the sole responsibility of the individual.115116
Marriage

The purpose of marriage in the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'i faith is mainly to foster spiritual harmony, fellowship and unity between a man and a woman and to provide a stable and loving environment for the rearing of children.117 The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; teachings on marriage call it a fortress for well-being and salvation and place marriage and the family as the foundation of the structure of human society.118 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h highly praised marriage, discouraged divorce and homosexuality, and required chastity outside of marriage; Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h taught that a husband and wife should strive to improve the spiritual life of each other.119 Interracial marriage is also highly praised throughout Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; scripture.120
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s intending to marry are asked to obtain a thorough understanding of the other's character before deciding to marry.121 Although parents should not choose partners for their children, once two individuals decide to marry, they must receive the consent of all living biological parents, even if one partner is not a Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;. The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; marriage ceremony is simple; the only compulsory part of the wedding is the reading of the wedding vows prescribed by Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h which both the groom and the bride read, in the presence of two witnesses.122 The vows are &quot;We will all, verily, abide by the Will of God.&quot;123
Work
Monasticism is forbidden, and Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s attempt to ground their spirituality in ordinary daily life. Performing useful work, for example, is not only required but considered a form of worship.124 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h prohibited a mendicant and ascetic lifestyle.125 The importance of self-exertion and service to humanity in one's spiritual life is emphasised further in Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's writings, where he states that work done in the spirit of service to humanity enjoys a rank equal to that of prayer and worship in the sight of God.126
Places of worship

 Most Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; meetings occur in individuals' homes, local Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; centers, or rented facilities. Worldwide, there are currently seven Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Houses of Worship, with an eighth under construction in Chile,127 and a further seven planned as of April 2012.128 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; writings refer to an institution called a &quot;Mashriqu'l-Adhk&lt;U+00E1&gt;r&quot; (Dawning-place of the Mention of God), which is to form the center of a complex of institutions including a hospital, university, and so on.129 The first ever Mashriqu'l-Adhk&lt;U+00E1&gt;r in `Ishq&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00E1&gt;d, Turkmenistan, has been the most complete House of Worship.130
Calendar

The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; calendar is based upon the calendar established by the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b. The year consists of 19 months, each having 19 days, with four or five intercalary days, to make a full solar year.131 The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; New Year corresponds to the traditional Persian New Year, called Naw R&lt;U+00FA&gt;z, and occurs on the vernal equinox, March 21, at the end of the month of fasting. Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; communities gather at the beginning of each month at a meeting called a Feast for worship, consultation and socializing.132
Each of the 19 months is given a name which is an attribute of God; some examples include Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt; (Splendour), &lt;U+2018&gt;Ilm (Knowledge), and Jam&lt;U+00E1&gt;l (Beauty).133 The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; week is familiar in that it consists of seven days, with each day of the week also named after an attribute of God. Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s observe 11 Holy Days throughout the year, with work suspended on 9 of these. These days commemorate important anniversaries in the history of the religion.134
Symbols
alt=Arabic script inscribed on a metal plate|thumb|upright=1.25|The calligraphy of the Greatest Name  The symbols of the religion are derived from the Arabic word Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt; ( &quot;splendor&quot; or &quot;glory&quot;), with a numerical value of 9, which is why the most common symbol is the nine-pointed star.135 The ringstone symbol and calligraphy of the Greatest Name are also often encountered. The former consists of two five-pointed stars interspersed with a stylized Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt; whose shape is meant to recall the three onenesses,136 while the latter is a calligraphic rendering of the phrase Y&lt;U+00E1&gt; Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'l-Abh&lt;U+00E1&gt; ( &quot;O Glory of the Most Glorious!&quot;).The five-pointed star is the symbol of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith.137138 In the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith, the star is known as the Haykal (), and it was initiated and established by the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b. The B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b and Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h wrote various works in the form of a pentagram.139
Socio-economic development

alt=A black-and-white photograph of several dozen girls seated in front of a school building|thumb|upright=1.25|Students of School for Girls, Tehran, August 13, 1933. This photograph may be of the students of Tarbiyat School for Girls which was established by the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Community of Tehran in 1911; the school was closed by government decree in 1934.140
Since its inception the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women,141 promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern,142 and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.143
The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated October 20, 1983 was released. Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.144
United Nations
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h wrote of the need for world government in this age of humanity's collective life. Because of this emphasis the international Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; community has chosen to support efforts of improving international relations through organizations such as the League of Nations and the United Nations, with some reservations about the present structure and constitution of the UN.145 The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; International Community is an agency under the direction of the Universal House of Justice in Haifa, and has consultative status with the following organizations:146147

United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM)
United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
World Health Organization (WHO)

The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; International Community has offices at the United Nations in New York and Geneva and representations to United Nations regional commissions and other offices in Addis Ababa, Bangkok, Nairobi, Rome, Santiago, and Vienna.148 In recent years an Office of the Environment and an Office for the Advancement of Women were established as part of its United Nations Office. The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith has also undertaken joint development programs with various other United Nations agencies. In the 2000 Millennium Forum of the United Nations a Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; was invited as the only non-governmental speaker during the summit.149
Persecution

alt=Broken cinder blocks and felled palm trees|thumb|upright=1.25|The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; cemetery in Yazd after its desecration by the government Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s continue to be persecuted in Islamic countries, as Islamic leaders do not recognize the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith as an independent religion, but rather as apostasy from Islam. The most severe persecutions have occurred in Iran, where over 200 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s were executed between 1978 and 1998,150 and in Egypt. The rights of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s have been restricted to greater or lesser extents in numerous other countries, including Afghanistan,151 Indonesia,152153 Iraq,154 Morocco,155 and several countries in sub-Saharan Africa.156
Iran
The marginalization of the Iranian Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s by current governments is rooted in historical efforts by Muslim clergy to persecute the religious minority. When the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b started attracting a large following, the clergy hoped to stop the movement from spreading by stating that its followers were enemies of God. These clerical directives led to mob attacks and public executions.157 Starting in the twentieth century, in addition to repression that impacted individual Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s, centrally directed campaigns that targeted the entire Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; community and institutions were initiated.158 In one case in Yazd in 1903 more than 100 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s were killed.159 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; schools, such as the Tarbiyat boys' and girl's schools in Tehran, were closed in the 1930s and 40s, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; marriages were not recognized and Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; texts were censored.160161
During the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, to divert attention from economic difficulties in Iran and from a growing nationalist movement, a campaign of persecution against the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s was instituted.162 An approved and coordinated anti-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; campaign (to incite public passion against the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s) started in 1955 and included the spreading of anti-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; propaganda on national radio stations and in official newspapers.163 In the late 1970s the Shah's regime consistently lost legitimacy due to criticism that it was pro-Western. As the anti-Shah movement gained ground and support, revolutionary propaganda was spread that some of the Shah's advisors were Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s.164 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s were portrayed as economic threats, supporters of Israel and the West, and societal hostility for the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s increased.165166
Since the Islamic Revolution of 1979 Iranian Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s have regularly had their homes ransacked or been banned from attending university or holding government jobs, and several hundred have received prison sentences for their religious beliefs, most recently for participating in study circles.167 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; cemeteries have been desecrated and property seized and occasionally demolished, including the House of M&lt;U+00ED&gt;rz&lt;U+00E1&gt; Buzurg, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's father.168 The House of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b in Shiraz, one of three sites to which Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s perform pilgrimage, has been destroyed twice.169170171
According to a US panel, attacks on Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s in Iran have increased since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president.172173 The United Nations Commission on Human Rights revealed an October 2005 confidential letter from Command Headquarters of the Armed Forces of Iran to identify Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s and to monitor their activities.174 Due to these actions, the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights stated on March 20, 2006, that she &quot;also expresses concern that the information gained as a result of such monitoring will be used as a basis for the increased persecution of, and discrimination against, members of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; faith, in violation of international standards. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this latest development indicates that the situation with regard to religious minorities in Iran is, in fact, deteriorating.&quot;175
On May 14, 2008, members of an informal body known as the &quot;Friends&quot; that oversaw the needs of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; community in Iran were arrested and taken to Evin prison.176177 The Friends court case has been postponed several times, but was finally underway on January 12, 2010.178 Other observers were not allowed in the court. Even the defence lawyers, who for two years have had minimal access to the defendants, had difficulty entering the courtroom.179 The chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said that it seems that the government has already predetermined the outcome of the case and is violating international human rights law.180 Further sessions were held on February 7, 2010,181 April 12, 2010182 and June 12, 2010.183 On August 11, 2010 it became known that the court sentence was 20 years imprisonment for each of the seven prisoners184 which was later reduced to ten years.185 After the sentence, they were transferred to Gohardasht prison.186 In March 2011 the sentences were reinstated to the original 20 years.187 On January 3, 2010, Iranian authorities detained ten more members of the Baha'i minority, reportedly including Leva Khanjani, granddaughter of Jamaloddin Khanjani, one of seven Baha'i leaders jailed since 2008 and in February, arrested his son, Niki Khanjani.188
The Iranian government claims that the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith is not a religion, but a political organization, and hence refuses to recognize it as a minority religion.189 However, the government has never produced convincing evidence supporting its characterization of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; community.190 Also the government's statements that Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s who recanted their religion would have their rights restored, attests to the fact that Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s are persecuted solely for their religious affiliation.191 The Iranian government also accuses the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith of being associated with Zionism because the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; World Centre is located in Haifa, Israel.192 These accusations against the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s have no basis in historical fact,193194195 and the accusations are used by the Iranian government to use the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s as &quot;scapegoats&quot;.196 In fact it was the Iranian Shah who banished Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h from Persia to the Ottoman Empire and he was later exiled by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, at the behest of the Persian Shah, to territories further away from Iran and finally to Acre in Syria, which only a century later was incorporated into the state of Israel.197
Egypt
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; institutions and community activities have been illegal under Egyptian law since 1960.198199 All Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; community properties, including Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; centers, libraries, and cemeteries, have been confiscated by the government and fatwas have been issued charging Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s with apostasy.200
The Egyptian identification card controversy began in the 1990s when the government modernized the electronic processing of identity documents, which introduced a de facto requirement that documents must list the person's religion as Muslim, Christian, or Jewish (the only three religions officially recognized by the government). Consequently, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s were unable to obtain government identification documents (such as national identification cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, or passports) necessary to exercise their rights in their country unless they lied about their religion, which conflicts with Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; religious principle.201 Without documents, they could not be employed, educated, treated in hospitals, travel outside of the country, or vote, among other hardships.202 Following a protracted legal process culminating in a court ruling favorable to the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s, the interior minister of Egypt released a decree on April 14, 2009, amending the law to allow Egyptians who are not Muslim, Christian, or Jewish to obtain identification documents that list dash in place of one of the three recognized religions.203 The first identification cards were issued to two Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s under the new decree on August 8, 2009.204
Reactions
Bernard Lewis states that the Muslim laity and Islamic authorities have always had great difficulty in accommodating post-Islamic monotheistic religions such as the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith, since the followers of such religions cannot be dismissed either as benighted heathens, like the polytheists of Asia and the animists of Africa, nor as followers of earlier revelations, like the Jews and Christians. Moreover, their very existence presents a challenge to the Islamic doctrine of the finality of Muhammad's revelation.205
