The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is an American four-engine heavy bomber aircraft developed for the U.S. Army Air Corps (USAAC). Competing against Douglas and Martin for a contract to build 200 planes, the airplane outperformed both the other entries and the Air Corps' expectations. Although losing the contract due to an accident, the Air Corps was so in favor of the B-17 that they ordered 13 B-17s regardless. Evolving through numerous design stages, from B-17A to G, the Flying Fortress is considered the first truly mass-produced large aircraft.
The B-17 was primarily involved in the daylight precision strategic bombing campaign of World War II against German industrial targets. The United States Eighth Air Force based in England and the Fifteenth Air Force based in Italy complemented the RAF Bomber Command's night-time area bombing in Operation Pointblank, which helped secure air superiority over the cities, factories and battlefields of Western Europe in preparation for Operation Overlord.1 The B-17 also participated, to a lesser extent, in the War in the Pacific.
From its pre-war inception, the USAAC touted the aircraft as a strategic weapon; it was a high-flying, long-ranging potent bomber capable of defending itself. With the ability to return home despite extensive battle damage, its durability, especially in belly-landings and ditchings , quickly took on mythical proportions.234 Stories and photos of B-17s surviving battle damage widely circulated, boosting its iconic status.5 Despite an inferior performance and bombload compared to the more numerous B-24 Liberator,6 a survey of Eighth Air Force crews showed a much higher rate of satisfaction in the B-17.7 With a service ceiling greater than any of its Allied contemporaries, the B-17 established itself as a superb weapons system, dropping more bombs than any other U.S. aircraft in World War II. Of the 1.5 million tonnes of bombs dropped on Germany, 500,000 tonnes were dropped from B-17s.
Design and development
On 8 August 1934, the U.S. Army Air Corps (USAAC) tendered a proposal for a multi-engined bomber to replace the Martin B-10. Requirements were that it would carry a &quot;useful bombload&quot; at an altitude of 10,000 feet for 10 hours with a top speed of at least 200 mph.89 They also desired, but did not require, a range of 2,000 miles and a speed of 250 mph. The Air Corps were looking for a bomber capable of reinforcing the air forces in Hawaii, Panama, and Alaska.10 The competition would be decided by a &quot;fly-off&quot; at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio. Boeing competed with the Douglas DB-1 and Martin Model 146 for the Air Corps contract.
 The prototype B-17, designated Model 299, was designed by a team of engineers led by E. Gifford Emery and Edward Curtis Wells and built at Boeing's own expense.11 It combined features of the experimental Boeing XB-15 bomber with the Boeing 247 transport airplane.12 The first Boeing aircraft with a flight-deck instead of an open cockpit, the B-17 was armed with both bombs (up to 4,800 pounds, on two racks in the bomb bay behind the cockpit) and five .30 caliber machine guns, and was powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1690 radial engines each producing 750 Horsepower at 7,000 feet.13
The first flight of the Model 229 was on 28 July 1935, with Boeing chief test-pilot Les Tower at the controls.1415 Richard Williams, a reporter for the Seattle Times coined the name &quot;Flying Fortress&quot; when the Model 299 was rolled out, bristling with multiple machine gun installations.16 Boeing was quick to see the value of the name and had it trademarked for use. On 20 August the prototype flew from Seattle to Wright Field in nine hours and three minutes at an average speed of 235 mph, much faster than the competition.17
At the fly-off, the four-engine Boeing design displayed superior performance over the twin-engine DB-1 and Model 146, and Admiral Frank Maxwell Andrews of the GHQ Air Force believed that the long-range capabilities of four-engine large aircraft were more efficient than shorter-ranged twin-engined airplanes. His opinions were shared by the Air Corps procurement officers and, even before the competition was finished, they suggested buying 65 B-17s.18
Development continued on the Boeing Model 299, and on 30 October 1935, the Army Air Corps test-pilots Ployer, Hill, and Tower, took the Model 299 on a second evaluation flight. The crew forgot to disengage the airplane's &quot;gust lock&quot;, a device that held the bomber's movable control surfaces in place while the plane was parked on the ground, and having taken off, the aircraft entered a steep climb, stalled, nosed over and crashed, killing the crew.1920 The crashed Model 299 could not finish the evaluation, and while the Air Corps was still enthusiastic about the aircraft's potential, Army officials were daunted by the much greater expense per aircraft.2122 Army Chief of Staff Malin Craig cancelled the order for 67 B-17s, and ordered 133 of the twin-engine Douglas B-18 Bolo instead.2324
Regardless, the USAAC had been impressed by the prototype's performance and, on January 17 1936, the Air Corps ordered, through a legal loophole,25 13 YB-17s for service testing. The YB-17 incorporated a number of significant changes from the Model 299, including more powerful Wright R-1820-39 Cyclone engines replacing the original Pratt &amp; Whitney's.
 On 1 March 1937, 12 of the 13 YB-17s were delivered to the 2nd Bombardment Group at Langley Field in Virginia, and used to help develop heavy bomber techniques and work out other bugs.26 One suggestion was the use of a checklist, to avoid accidents such as the Model 299's.2728 In one of their first missions, three B-17s, following lead navigator Lt. Curtis LeMay, were sent by Admiral Andrews to &quot;intercept&quot; the Italian ocean liner Rex 800 miles off the Atlantic coast and take photographs. The successful mission was widely publicized.29
The 13th YB-17 was delivered to the Material Division at Wright Field, Ohio, to be used for flight testing.30
A 14th YB-17 (37-369), originally constructed for ground testing of the airframe's strength, was upgraded and fitted with exhaust-driven turbochargers. Scheduled to fly in 1937, it encountered problems with the turbochargers and its first flight was delayed until 29 April 1938.31 Modifications cost Boeing $100,000 USD and took until spring 1939 to complete, but resulted in an increased service ceiling and maximum speed.32 The aircraft was delivered to the Army on 31 January 1939 and was redesignated B-17A to signify the first operational variant.33
In late 1937 the Air Corps ordered 10 more planes, designated B-17B, and soon after, another 29.34 Improved with larger flaps, rudder, and Plexiglas nose, the B-17Bs were delivered between July 1939 and March 1940. They equipped two bombardment groups, one on each U.S. coast.3536
Prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, fewer than 200 B-17s were in use with the Army,37 but production quickly accelerated, and the B-17 became the first truly mass-produced large aircraft. 3839 The aircraft went on to serve in every World War II combat zone, and by the time production ended in May 1945, 12,731 aircraft had been built by Boeing, Douglas and Vega (a subsidiary of Lockheed).40
Operational service
 The B-17 entered World War II with the RAF in 1941, was joined by USAAF Eighth Air Force and Fifteenth Air Force units in 1942, and was primarily involved in the daylight precision strategic bombing campaign against German industrial targets. Operation Pointblank guided attacks in preparation for a ground assault.41
The RAF
The Royal Air Force (RAF) entered World War II with no heavy bomber of its own and while by 1941, the Short Stirling and Handley Page Halifax had become its primary bombers, in early 1940, the RAF entered into an agreement with the U.S. Army Air Corps to be provided with 20 B-17Cs, redesignated Fortress I. Their first operation was against Wilhelmshaven on 8 July 1941.424344 At the time, the Air Corps considered high-altitude flight to be 20,000 feet but, to avoid being intercepted by fighter planes, the RAF bombed the naval barracks from 30,000 feet.45 They were unable to hit their targets and temperatures were so low that the machine guns froze up.46 On July 24 they tried another target, Brest in France, but again missed completely.
By September, the RAF had lost eight B-17Cs in combat or to accidents, and Bomber command had abandoned daylight bombing raids due to the Fortress I's poor performance. The remaining aircraft were transferred to different commands and used for various duties.47 The experience had showed both the RAF and USAAF that the B-17C was not ready for combat, and that improved defenses, larger bombloads and more accurate bombing methods were required, which would be incorporated in later variations. Moreover, even with these improvements, it was the USAAF and not the RAF that was willing to remain faithful to using the B-17 as a &quot;day&quot; bomber.48
The USAAF
For the Air Corps (renamed United States Army Air Force or USAAF in 1941), the B-17 and other bombers were able to accurately bomb from high altitudes by the use of the then-secret Norden Bombsight, which was an optical electro-mechanical gyro-stabilized computer. During daylight bombing missions and sorties, the device was able to determine, from variables input by the bombardier, the point in space at which the bomber's ordnance type should be released to hit the target. The bombardier essentially took over flight control of the aircraft during the bomb run, maintaining a level attitude during the final moments.49
The USAAF began building up its air forces in Europe using B-17Es soon after entering the war. The first Eighth Air Force units arrived in High Wycombe, England on 12 May 1942, to form the 97th Bomb Group.50 On 17 August 1942, 18 B-17Es of the 97th, including Yankee Doodle, flown by Brigadier General Ira Eaker, were escorted by RAF Spitfires on the first USAAF raid over Europe, against railroad marshalling yards at Rouen-Sotteville in France.5152 The operation was a success, with only minor damage to two aircraft.
Combined offensive
The two different strategies of the American and British Bomber commands were organized at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943. The resulting Operation Pointblank described a &quot;Combined Bomber Offensive&quot; that would weaken the Nazi Wehrmacht and establish air superiority in preparation of a ground offensive.53
Operation Pointblank opened with attacks on targets in Western Europe. General Ira C. Eaker and the Eighth Air Force placed highest priority on attacks on the German aircraft industry, especially fighter assembly plants, engine factories and ball-bearing manufacturers.54
On 17 April 1943, an attack on the Focke-Wulf plant at Bremen by 115 Fortresses met with little success. Sixteen aircraft were shot down, and 48 others were damaged.55 The attacks did succeed, however, in diverting about half the Luftwaffe's fighter force to anti-bomber operations.
 Since the airfield bombings were not appreciably reducing German fighter strength, as additional B-17 groups were formed, Eaker ordered major missions deeper into Germany against important industrial targets. The 8th Air Force then targeted the ball-bearing factories in Schweinfurt, hoping to cripple the war effort there. The first attack, on 17 August 1943 by 230 B-17s, was met by 300 Luftwaffe fighters. Thirty-six aircraft were downed, with the loss of 200 men, but the attack did not critically damage the factories.
A second attempt on 14 October 1943 would later come to be known as &quot;Black Thursday&quot;. 56 Of the 291 attacking Fortresses, 59 were shot down over Germany, one ditched in the English Channel, five crashed in England, and 12 more were scrapped due to battle damage or crash-landings (more by AA guns than the Luftwaffe), a total loss of 77 B-17s. One-hundred and twenty-two bombers were damaged to some degree and needed repairs before their next flight. Out of 2900 men in the crews, about 650 men did not return, although some survived as POWs. Five were killed and 43 wounded in the damaged aircraft that made it home, and 594 were listed as Missing in Action. Only 33 bombers landed without damage. These losses could not be sustained, and the USAAF, recognizing the vulnerability of heavy bombers against interceptors, suspended daylight bomber raids deep into Germany until the development of an escort fighter that could protect the bombers all the way from the United Kingdom to Germany and back.
A third raid on Schweinfurt was attempted on 24 February 1944 during what came to be known as &quot;Big Week&quot;. With P-51 Mustang fighters escorting the American heavies all the way to and from the targets, only 11 of 231 B-17s were lost.57 The P-51 escort reduced the loss rate to below seven percent, with only 244 of the 3,500 B-17s lost whilst taking part in the Big Week raids.58
By 27 April 1945, the rate of aircraft loss was so low that replacement aircraft were no longer arriving and the number of planes per bomb group was reduced. The Combined Bomber Offensive was effectively complete.59
Pacific Theater
Only five B-17 groups operated in the Southwest Pacific theater, with a peak of 168 bombers in September, 1942, and all groups converting to other types by mid-1943. While there, the Fifth Air Force B-17s were tasked with disrupting the Japanese sea lines. Air Corps doctrine dictated bombing runs from high altitude, but it was soon discovered that only one percent of their bombs hit targets. The 5th's commander, Lt. Gen. George Kenney, was enthusiastic about the new technique of skip-bombing&lt;U+2014&gt;a process in which the bombs were released at a very low altitude, causing them to strike the water's surface at a sufficiently shallow angle for them to be deflected off&lt;U+2014&gt;, and on 23 October 1942, six B-17s of the 64th Squadron bombed conventionally from 10,000 feet while six 63rd Squadron bombers came in at 100 feet to skip their bombs into the sides of Japanese ships.60
During WWII the B-17 equipped 32 overseas combat groups, inventory peaking in August 1944 at 4,574 USAAF planes worldwide,61 and dropped 640,036 tons of bombs on European targets (compared to 452,508 tons dropped by the Liberator and 463,544 tons dropped by all other U.S. aircraft). Approximately 4750, or one third, of B-17s built were lost in combat.62
Bomber defense
 Before the advent of long-range fighter escorts, B-17s had only their .50 caliber M2 Browning machine guns to rely on for defense during the bombing runs over Europe. As the war intensified, Boeing used feedback from aircrews to improve each new variant with increased armament and armor.63 The number of defensive guns increased from four 0.50 inch machine guns and one 0.30 inch nose machine gun in the B-17C, to 13 0.50 inch machine guns in the B-17G. But because the bombers could not dogfight with attacking fighters, and during their final bomb run they needed to be flown straight and level, individual aircraft struggled to fend off a direct attack.
A 1943 survey by the Air Corps found that over half the bombers shot down by the Germans, had left the protection of the main formation.64 To address this problem, the United States developed the bomb-group formation, which evolved into the staggered combat box formation where all the B-17s could safely cover any others in their formation with their machine guns, making a formation of the bombers a dangerous target to engage by enemy fighters.6566 However, the use of this rigid formation meant that individual planes could not engage in evasive manoeuvres: they had to always fly in a straight line, which made them vulnerable to the German 88 mm anti-aircraft gun. Additionally, German fighter planes later used the tactic of high-speed strafing passes rather than engaging with individual aircraft to inflict maximum damage with minimum risk. As a result, the B-17s' loss rate was up to 25% on some early missions (60 of 291 B-17s were lost in combat on the fourth Raid on Schweinfurt67), and it was not until the advent of an effective long-range fighter escort&lt;U+2014&gt;the P-51 Mustang&lt;U+2014&gt;that the B-17 became strategically potent.
The B-17 was noted for its ability to absorb battle damage, still reach its target and bring its crew home safely. Wally Hoffman, a B-17 Pilot with the Eighth Air Force during World War II, said, &quot;The plane can be cut and slashed almost to pieces by enemy fire and bring its crew home.&quot;68 Its toughness more than compensated for its shorter range and lighter bomb load when compared to the Consolidated B-24 Liberator or the British Avro Lancaster heavy bombers. Stories abound of B-17s returning to base with tails having been destroyed, with only a single engine functioning or even with large portions of wings having been damaged by flak.69 This durability, together with the large operational numbers in the Eighth Air Force and the fame achieved by the &quot;Memphis Belle&quot;, made the B-17 a significant bomber aircraft of the war. 
The B-17 design went through eight major changes over the course of its production, culminating in the B-17G, differing from its immediate predecessor by the addition of a chin turret with two .50 caliber M2 Browning machine guns under the nose. This eliminated the B-17's main defensive weakness in head-on attacks.
The Luftwaffe
After examining wrecked B-17s and B-24s, Luftwaffe officers discovered that at least 20 hits with 20 mm shells fired from the rear could bring them down. Pilots of average ability hit the bombers with only about two percent of the rounds they fired, so to obtain 20 hits, the average pilot had to aim one thousand 20 mm rounds at the bomber. Early versions of the Fw 190, one of the best German interceptor fighters, were equipped with two 20 mm cannons and carried only 500 rounds. The fighter's firing-range, 400 meters, was also shorter than the B-17's 1,000 meters, and so was vulnerable while closing in through that distance. The German fighters found that when attacking from the front, where fewer defensive guns were pointed, it only took four or five hits to bring a bomber down.70 To address the Fw 190's shortcomings, the number of cannons fitted was doubled to four with a corresponding increase in the amount of ammunition carried, and in 1944, a further upgrade to 30 mm MK 108 cannons was made, which could bring a bomber down in just a few hits. The Me 262 had moderate success against the B-17 late in the war. Equipped with the R4M rocket, it could fire from outside the range of the bombers' .50 caliber defensive guns and bring a plane down with one hit.71
During World War II, after crash-landing or being forced down, approximately 40 B-17s were repaired and put back into the air by the Luftwaffe. Given German markings and codenamed &quot;Dornier Do 200&quot;, the captured B-17s were used for clandestine spy and reconnaissance missions by the Luftwaffe&lt;U+2014&gt;most often used by the Luftwaffe unit known as KG 200.72 Some B-17s kept their Allied markings and were used to infiltrate B-17 formations and report on their position and altitude. The practice was initially successful, but the Army Air Force combat aircrews quickly developed and established standard procedures to first warn off, and then fire upon any &quot;stranger&quot; trying to join a group's formation.73 Still other B-17s were used to determine the airplane's vulnerabilities and to train German interceptor pilots in tactics.74
Post-war history
Following World War II, the B-17 was declared obsolete and the Army Air Force retired most of its fleet. Flight crews ferried the bombers back across the Atlantic to the United States, where the majority were melted down and sold for scrap. The USAF Strategic Air Command had B-17 Flying Fortresses (called F-9s: for Fotorecon, at first, later RB-17s) in service from 1946 through 1951. A number of B-17s still survive in museums and at airports, of which about a dozen still fly, visiting airports or performing in airshows. Most of these surviving examples are surplus or training aircraft, which stayed in the U.S. during World War II. However, there are a few exceptions.
Several B-17s along with other World War II bombers were converted into airliners. Other B-17s saw extended and valiant service as converted aerial tankers used for fighting forest fires in the western United States.75

The B-17 was a versatile aircraft, serving in dozens of USAAF units in theaters of combat throughout World War II, and in non-bomber roles for the RAF. Its main use was in Europe, where its shorter range and smaller bombload relative to other aircraft available did not hamper it as much as in the Pacific Theater. Peak USAAF inventory (in August, 1944) was 4,574 worldwide.76
During World War II, after crash-landing or being forced down, approximately 40 B-17s were repaired and put back into the air by the Luftwaffe. These captured aircraft were codenamed &quot;Dornier Do 200&quot;, given German markings and used for clandestine spy and reconnaissance missions by the Luftwaffe-most often used by the Luftwaffe unit known as KG 200, hence a likely possibility as a source for the &quot;Do 200&quot; codename.77
Late in World War II, RAF and USAAF bombers that had been damaged in raids over the Reich would put down in Soviet-controlled territory rather than try to make it back to Western bases, and in April 1945 the Soviet Air Force issued a directive to its units in the field to report the location of any aircraft of its Western Allies that were in Soviet hands; among the aircraft salvaged were a total of 73 B-17s. The Fortresses that were in the best condition were returned to the USAAF, but a number were retained as interim heavy bombers. Although Russian aircrews and maintenance crews had no experience with such aircraft, the Soviets proved ingenious at keeping them flying, and in fact were delighted with the B-17's handling, comparing it to a &quot;swallow&quot; and the nimble Po-2 biplane trainer. On the other hand, Soviet officials tended to order the &quot;filthy pictures&quot; applied to the aircraft removed or painted out. The B-17s remained in service until 1948, when the Tupolev Tu-4 began to arrive at operational squadrons. 78
When Israel achieved statehood in 1948, the Israeli Air Force had to be assembled quickly to defend the new nation from the war it found itself almost immediately embroiled in. Among the first aircraft acquired by the Israeli Air Force were three surplus American B-17s, smuggled via South America and Czechoslovakia to avoid an arms trading ban imposed by the United States. A fourth plane was abandoned due to malfunctions and confiscated by American officials. On their delivery flight from Europe, in retaliation for Egyptian bombing raids on Tel-Aviv, the aircraft were ordered to bomb King Farouk's Royal Palace in Cairo before continuing to Israel. They performed the mission (despite some of the crew fainting due to defective oxygen equipment), but caused little damage. The B-17s were generally unsuitable for the needs of the Israeli Air Force, and the nature of the conflict in which long-range bombing raids on large area targets were relatively unimportant&lt;U+2014&gt;although the psychological impact of the raids was not lost on the enemy. The aircraft were mainly used in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, flown by 69 Squadron IAF; they were withdrawn in 1958 after seeing minor action in the 1956 Suez Crisis.7980
Other countries acquired and operated B-17s:

Bolivia &lt;U+2014&gt; Used 26 B-17s in civil aviation under different operators.81
Brazil &lt;U+2014&gt; Acquired 13 B-17s in 1951, according to the Rio Pact of 1947. They were used by the 1&lt;U+00BA&gt; and 2&lt;U+00BA&gt; Esquadr&lt;U+00F5&gt;es (1st and 2nd Squadrons) of 6&lt;U+00BA&gt; Grupo de Avia&lt;U+00E7&gt;&lt;U+00E3&gt;o (6th Aviation Group), based at Recife, for search and rescue and photo-reconnaissance until the 1960s.82
Canada &lt;U+2014&gt; The RCAF's six Flying Fortresses (three B-17Es and three B-17Fs) flew 240 trans-Atlantic mail flights from Canada to Canadian troops serving in Europe from 6 December 1943 to 27 December 1946. All six belonged to no. 168 Heavy Transport Squadron which operated out of RCAF Station Rockcliffe, Ontario.83
Denmark &lt;U+2014&gt; Danish airline DDL bought two B-17s from Sweden in 1945.84
Dominican Republic &lt;U+2014&gt; Acquired two B-17Gs in 1947.85
France &lt;U+2014&gt; Used one B-17F as an executive transport for Free-French General M. P. Koening.86
Portugal &lt;U+2014&gt; For&lt;U+00E7&gt;a A&lt;U+00E9&gt;rea Portuguesa (Portuguese Air Force) operated five SB-17Gs as search-and-rescue planes from 1957 to 1960.87


United States &lt;U+2014&gt; Following the war, Trans World Airlines purchased a surplus B-17G and used it to survey and set up routes in the Middle-East. In 1947, it was given to the Shah of Iran.88

The B-17 went through several alterations in each of its design stages and variants. Of the 13 YB-17s ordered for service testing, 12 were used by the 2nd Bomb Group of Langley Field, Virginia to develop heavy bombing techniques, and the 13th was used for flight testing at the Material Division at Wright Field, Ohio.97 Experiments on this plane led to the use of a turbo-supercharger, which would become standard on the B-17 line. A 14th plane, the Y1B-17A, originally destined for ground testing only, was upgraded with the turbocharger. When this aircraft had finished testing, it was re-designated the B-17A, and in April 1938 was the first plane to enter service under the B-17 designation.9899
As the production line developed, Boeing engineers continued to improve upon the basic design. To enhance performance at slower speeds, the B-17B was altered to include larger rudder and flaps.100 The B-17C changed from gun blisters to flush, oval-shaped windows.101 Most significantly, with the B-17E version, the fuselage was extended by 10 feet, a much larger vertical fin and rudder were incorporated into the original design, a gunner's position in the tail and an improved nose were added. The engines were upgraded to more powerful versions several times, and similarly, the gun stations were altered on numerous occasions to enhance their effectiveness.102 
By the time the definitive B-17G appeared, the number of guns had been increased from seven to 13, the designs of the gun stations were finalized, and other adjustments were complete. The B-17G was the final version of the B-17, incorporating all changes made to its predecessor, the B-17F, and in total 8,680 were built, the last one on 9 April 1945.103 Many B-17Gs were converted for other missions such as cargo hauling, engine testing and reconnaissance.104 Initially designated SB-17G, a number of B-17Gs were also converted for search-and-rescue duties, later to be redesignated B-17H.105
Two versions of the B-17 were flown under different designations. These were the XB-38 and the YB-40. The XB-38 was an engine test-bed for Allison V-1710 liquid-cooled engines, should the Wright engines normally used on the B-17 become unavailable. The YB-40 was a heavily armed modification of the standard B-17 used before the P-51 Mustang, an effective long-range fighter, became available to act as escort. Additional armament included a power turret in the radio-room, a chin turret (which went on to become standard with the B-17G) and twin .50 caliber (12.7 mm) guns in the waist positions. The ammunition load was over 11,000 rounds, making the YB-40 well over 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) heavier than a fully loaded B-17F. Unfortunately, the YB-40s with their numerous heavy modifications had trouble keeping up with empty bombers, and so, together with the advent of the P-51 Mustang, the project was abandoned and finally phased out in July 1943.106107
Late in World War II, at least 25 B-17s were fitted with radio controls, loaded with 20,000 pounds (9,000 kg) of high-explosives, dubbed &quot;BQ-7 Aphrodite missiles&quot;, and used against U-boat pens and bomb-resistant fortifications. Because few (if any) BQ-7s hit their target, the Aphrodite project was scrapped in early 1945.108109 During and after World War II, a number of weapons were tested and used operationally on B-17s. Some of these weapons included &quot;razons&quot; (radio-guided) glide bombs, and JB-2 Thunderbugs&lt;U+2014&gt;the equivalent of the German V-1 Buzz Bomb. In the late 1950s, the last B-17s in United States Air Force service were QB-17 drones and DB-17P drone controllers, plus a few polished VB-17 squadron &quot;hacks&quot;.
The Fortress as a symbol
The B-17 Flying Fortress has become, for many reasons, deserved or not, an icon of American power and a symbol of its Air Force. It achieved a lasting fame in the general public, which has eluded most other bomber aircraft.110  During the 1930s, the USAAC, under Gen. Frank Maxwell Andrews and the Air Corps Tactical School, touted the bomber as a strategic weapon. 111 Gen Henry H. Arnold, Chief of the Air Corps, recommended the devolpment of bigger airplanes with better performance and the Tactical school agreed completely.112 The B-17 was exactly what the Air Corps was looking for; it was a high-flying, long-ranging potent bomber capable of defending itself.
When the Model 299 was rolled out on 28 July 1935, bristling with multiple machine gun installations, Richard Williams, a reporter for the Seattle Times coined the name &quot;Flying Fortress&quot; with his comment &quot;Why, it's a flying fortress!&quot;.113 Boeing was quick to see the value of the name and had it trademarked for use.
After the initial B-17s were delivered to the Air Corps 2nd Bombardment Group, they began sending them on promotional flights emphasizing its great range and navigational precision. In early 1938, Group commander Colonel Robert C. Olds flew a Y1B-17 from the east to west coast. Setting a transcontinental record of 12 hours 50 minutes. He also broke the west-to-east coast record on the return trip, averaging 245 mph in 10 hours 46 minutes. Six planes of the 2nd Bombardment group took off from Langley AFB on February 15, 1938 as part of a good will flight to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Covering 12,000 miles they returned on February 27.114 In a well publicized mission, three B-17s, &quot;intercepted&quot; and took photographs of the Italian ocean liner Rex 800 miles off the Atlantic coast.115
The Flying Fortress found a place in the public mind as well. In 1943, Consolidated Aircraft commissioned a poll to see &lt;U+201C&gt;to what degree the public is familiar with the names of the Liberator and the Flying Fortress.&lt;U+201D&gt; Of 2,500 men in cities where Consolidated ads had been run in newspapers, only 73 percent had heard of the Liberator, while 90 percent knew of the B-17.116
Hollywood featured the airplane in its movies, such as Twelve O'Clock High, with Gregory Peck.117 This film was made with the full cooperation of the United States Air Force and made use of actual combat footage. In 1964 the movie was made into a television show of the same name, and ran for three years. The B-17 also appeared in the 1938 movie Test Pilot with Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy.
During the war, the largest offensive bombing force, the Eighth Air Force, was run by officers who openly preferred the B-17. Lt. Gen. Jimmy Doolittle wrote about his preference for equipping the Eighth with B-17s. Citing the logistical advantage in keeping fielded forces down to a minimum number of aircraft types with their unique servicing and spares, he wanted B-17 bombers and P-51 fighters for the Eighth. His views were supported by Eighth Air Force statisticians, whose studies purportedly showed that Fortresses had utility and survivability much greater than that of the B-24.118
Loved by its crews for bringing them home despite extensive battle damage, its durability, especially in belly-landings and ditchings , quickly took on mythical proportions.119120121 Stories and photos of B-17s surviving battle damage widely circulated, boosting its iconic status.122 Despite an inferior performance and bombload compared to the more numerous B-24 Liberator,123 a survey of Eighth Air Force crews showed a much higher rate of satisfaction in the B-17.124
The most famous B-17, the Memphis Belle, toured the U.S. with its crew to reinforce national morale (and to sell War Bonds), and starred in a USAAF documentary, Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress.125
After the war ended, most B-17s were scrapped, but the U.S. Air Force did keep some B-17s for VIP transports and drone directors. The Navy and Coast Guard obtained a few B-17s for over-water patrols well into the postwar years. These surviving planes, and the status of the Flying Fortress prompted many people and organizations around the world to protect or rebuild planes, some of which are still flying.126
Noted B-17s
 The &quot;Memphis Belle&quot;, which flew 25 missions over Europe before touring the United States to advertise war bonds, was preserved in Memphis from 1948 to 2003, and then transported to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in October 2005 for restoration and eventual display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force located there. The restoration is expected to take eight to ten years.127
&quot;The Swoose&quot;, the only surviving example of the narrow-tailed B-17s of the A, B, C and D series, flew combat missions in the Pacific Theater before being converted to an unarmed transport/flying command-post used in Australia by Lt. Gen. George Brett, commander of Allied air forces in the South West Pacific Area. It returned to the United States with Brett in 1943, and is the oldest surviving B-17 in the world. &quot;The Swoose&quot; is presently in storage at the Smithsonian Institution's Silver Hill (&quot;Paul E. Garber&quot; Preservation, Restoration and Storage Facility in Suitland, Maryland) where, as of 2000, plans have been made to restore her. Col. Frank Kurtz, commanding officer of the 463rd Bombardment Group at the Celone Airbase near Foggia,Italy, and the father of actress Swoosie Kurtz (b. 6 September 1944), carried the Swoose name forward from the original Swoose (which he flew in the Pacific prior to being named CO of the 463rd), naming the B-17G he flew with the 463rd &quot;Swoose II&quot;.128 The 463rd BG was thereafter known as the &quot;The Swoose Group&quot;. The name &quot;Swoosie&quot; was a derivative of Kurtz's original name for his B-17, which he referred to as a &quot;half-swan, half-goose&quot;, from bandleader Kay Kyser's song, Alexander the Swoose.129
&quot;Shoo Shoo Baby&quot; (later &quot;Shoo Shoo Shoo Baby&quot;) flew 24 combat missions from England with the 91st Bomb Group from March 1944 until being forced to land in Sweden in May 1944. Being neutral, Sweden interned the crew, and about the same time a deal was made between the Swedish and U.S. governments to allow around 300 American crewmen to return in exchange for nine B-17Fs and Gs that had landed intact in Sweden. Seven of these were converted by Saab Aircraft into airliners that could carry 14 passengers.130 &quot;Shoo Shoo Shoo Baby&quot; flew for SILA (now Scandinavian Airlines). In December 1945, it was one of two B-17s sold to the Danish Air Lines (DDL), until June 1947. The B-17 was subsequently transferred in March 1948 to the Danish Army Air Corps, her nickname was &quot;Store Bj&lt;U+00F8&gt;rn&quot;, and in December 1949, to the Danish Navy. Then, from October 1952, to the Royal Danish Air Force as ESK-721; finally retiring a year later.  After two years in storage, she was sold as F-BGSP to the Institut G&lt;U+00E9&gt;ographique National, a French aerial mapping company based in Creil outside Paris. Last flown in July 1961, the remains of the plane were donated to the U.S. Air Force in 1972. A restoration was undertaken between 1978&lt;U+2013&gt;1988 at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware and the aircraft can be seen today at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. The name was restored to &quot;Shoo Shoo Baby&quot; and, due to the amount of skin work required to restore its wartime appearance, it is finished in olive drab and grey, instead of bare-metal as it was in operations. When the &quot;Memphis Belle&quot; restoration is complete, it will replace &quot;Shoo Shoo Baby&quot; as the museum's B-17 exhibit.
As part of Operation Bolero, on 15 July 1942, two B-17s navigating and acting as mother ships, along with six P-38 Lightnings, were forced to land on a glacier in Greenland during a ferry flight to the United Kingdom. None of the crews were lost, but by the 1990s, these eight aircraft had been buried under more than 250 feet of ice. Although the recovery effort located the lead B-17 to find it crushed, one of the P-38s was subsequently recovered and restored as &quot;Glacier Girl&quot;.131
The &quot;Nine-O-Nine&quot; (42-31909), of the 91st Bomb Group, 323rd Bomb Squadron, completed 140 missions without an abort or loss of a crewman. Assigned to combat on 25 February 1944 she made 18 trips to Berlin, dropped 562,000 pounds of bombs, and flew 1,129 hours. She had 21 engine changes, four wing panel changes, 15 main gas tank changes, and 18 Tokyo tank changes (long-range fuel tanks). M/Sgt. Rollin L. Davis, a maintenance line chief in charge of this plane, received the Bronze Star for his part in this.132
