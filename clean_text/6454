Xeno M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller (born 7 August 1972 in Zurich) is a Swiss rower and Olympic gold medallist.
His first international appearance was at the 1990 Junior World Rowing Championships - winning bronze in his single scull (1x).
He first competed at the senior level in 1991, and at the age of 19, finished 11th at the World Rowing Championships in Vienna in the single scull. At the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, he just missed making the finals, finishing fourth in the semi-finals (3 to advance). M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller chose not to start the petite (consolation) finals for places 7 through 12 because of a back injury. In 1994 and 1995, he finished 2nd and 6th, respectively, at the World Championships.
During this period, M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller began studying at Brown University in the United States. He helped lead Brown to an undefeated season and a national championship in 1993 in the eight man boat. Following this collegiate victory and his subsequent disappointing finish at the 1993 World Championships in the double scull event, M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller decided to concentrate solely on the single scull. This decision created friction between M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller and the then coach at Brown Steve Gladstone.
After spending two years in Providence, Rhode Island attending Brown and rowing his single scull, M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller moved to Newport Beach, California which offered a better climate for year round training. He also met his future wife in Newport.
M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller won gold in the single scull at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller won the race with a strong finish. He was 3 seconds down and in fourth place at the 1000 meter mark (half way) and he moved up to third and just 1 second down with 500 meters to go. M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller then lauched a devasting drive to the line. He won decisively besting Derek Porter who had led the whole race, and his childhood hero, and two-time Olympic Champion Thomas Lange who finished third. M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller's last 500 was the fastest 500 meter split time of the day.
Following his Olympic victory, M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller took a year off from rowing. In 1998, he won two World Cup race besting future rival Rob Waddell. But at the World Rowing Championships, Waddell had the best race of his life pushing M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller back to second. In the pre-season to the 1998 rowing calendar, Waddell set a world record on the indoor rowing machine, which measures the amount of energy he was able to produce in a simulated rowing event. In 1999, Waddell went on to sweep the World Cup races and the World Championships, M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller getting second each time.
Leading up to the 2000 Sydney Olympics, M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller entered World Cup race in Vienna, where he finally beat Waddell after four consecutive second place finishes. M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller did not enter any other preliminary races, and Waddell won the World Cup race in Lucerne. Between the 1996 Olympics and the 2000 Olympics, M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller's record against Waddell was 3 out of 7.
Both Waddell and M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller won all of their preliminary heats leading up to the Olympic finals. In the finals, in addition to his rival two-time reigning World Champion Rob Waddell, M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller faced former World Champion and Olympic silver medalist Derek Porter and rising star Marcel Hacker. It was the closest men's single scull final ever. They battled down the course with the lead changing several times. M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller gained the lead in the last 1000 meters. But Waddell stayed with him. They battled down the course, just a few feet separate them. Gradually Waddell wore M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller down, passing him in the sprint. M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller continued to hang tough and held on for the silver medal. Hacker finished third and a disappointed Porter finished fourth. Just over two seconds - the length of a boat - separated first from fourth place.
Having lived in the United States since 1992 (and attending Brown University) M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller became a naturalized citizen of the United States in early 2004. He then announced he would trial for the US team for the Athens Olympics. He had won all of the preliminary trial races. However just before the start of the final set of trials, there were a number of high-profile killings of foreigners in Iraq as part of the Iraq War, and Americans were believed to be potential targets for violence at the Olympics by al Quida. M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller pulled out of the trials saying:


&quot;When you have three children and a wife and you leave them, then leave them again to go overseas, and you see somebody's head getting cut off ... you start having clouds in your head for why you want to proceed like this, with all the responsibility about traveling, leaving the family, etcetera.&quot;


M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller currently runs a rowing gymnasium in Orange County, California and is a goodwill ambassador for the sport of rowing.
