The Robin Hood Cave Horse or Ochre Horse is a fragment of rib engraved with a horse's head, discovered in 1876 in the Robin Hood Cave in Creswell Crags, Derbyshire. It is the only piece of Upper Palaeolithic art showing an animal to have been found in Britain.123 It is now in the British Museum, but not on display. A replica of the artifact is displayed at the Creswell Crags Museum.
Discovery
Early excavations of the Robin Hood Cave were carried out by Professor Sir William Boyd Dawkins, who wrote several papers on his findings. In July 1876, the Reverend J M Mello discovered the Ochre Horse at the back of the western chamber in the Robin Hood Cave in Creswell Crags.4 Dawkins described it as '' 'the head and fore quarters of a horse incised on a smoothed and rounded fragment of rib, cut short off at one end and broken at the other. On the flat side the head is represented with the nostrils and mouth and neck carefully drawn. A series of fine oblique lines show that the animal was hog-maned. They stop at the bend of the back which is very correctly drawn . . .' ''.5
There were accusations, in the years after the discovery, then revived in the 1920s, and lingering still today, that the piece is a genuine Paleolithic work, but found in France and fraudulently found or left to be found in the Robin Hood Cave. Similar accusations were made against a Machairodus or sabre-toothed cat tooth found at the same time, and equally singular among the many thousands of animal remains excavated at the site. However modern scientific tests support the local origin of the tooth, which has a similar chemical profile to other local animal remains, and differs from French examples. In the 1920s, three further fragments claimed as showing engraved animals were found, but these are less widely accepted, and might be wholly caused by natural means, such as the action of roots.6 There is also the possibility that the piece was indeed made in France, but carried to Britain (no sea crossing was then needed) in the Paleolithic before being deposited.7 In 2003 the first British examples of cave art were also found at Creswell Crags.8
In 2003, the Ochre Horse was estimated to be between 12,500 and 13,000 years old.91011 The style of the horse inscription resembles drawings found on French Late Magdalenian sites,12 where horses are the most popular subject, even though they represent a relatively small proportion of the animal bones found in sites occupied by humans.
