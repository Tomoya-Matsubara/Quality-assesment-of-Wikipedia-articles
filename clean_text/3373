Joe Hamilton, best known as the quarterback for Georgia Tech from 1996 to 1999. Currently the quarterback for the Orlando Predators in the Arena Football League.
Personal Information
Joe was born Joseph Fitzgerald Hamilton on March 13, 1977 in Alvin, South Carolina. He was raised by his parents Joseph and Ginger Hamilton. He played high school football and basketball for Macedonia High School in South Carolina.
Football career
Hamilton set Atlantic Coast Conference career records for total offense (10,640 yards), touchdown passes (65) and total touchdowns (83). He won numerous NCAA accolades, including the Davey O'Brien Award as a senior and he was a finalist for the 1999 Heisman Trophy in his senior year, finishing in second place behind Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne. In 2002 he was named as one of the 50 members of the ACC 50th Anniversary Football Team.
Due to his lack of prototypical height for an NFL quarterback (standing just 5'10&quot;), he fell to the 7th round of the 2000 NFL draft before being drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In three years with the Buccaneers he only played four downs in a single regular-season game. In 2002 the Buccaneers allocated Hamilton to NFL Europe, where he led the Frankfurt Galaxy to 5-2 record in 2002 before suffering a severe knee injury (torn ACL). He spent the entire 2002 NFL season on injured reserve and was released by the Buccaneers at the end of the season. He received a Super Bowl ring following the Buccaneers' victory in Super Bowl XXXVII.
He signed with the Arena Football League's Orlando Predators in 2004 and guided the team to a 9-5 record and the playoffs, despite suffering another knee injury and missing two and a half games.
He was then signed by the Indianapolis Colts in 2004, reuniting with former Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy, but only saw limited action in one game before being released during the season.
He returned to the Orlando Predators where he is currently the starting quarterback. He has a 32-15 record as the Predators' starter and led them to ArenaBowl XX in 2006, losing 69-61 to the Chicago Rush. With a win, Hamilton would have become the first player in history to own both a Super Bowl and ArenaBowl ring.
