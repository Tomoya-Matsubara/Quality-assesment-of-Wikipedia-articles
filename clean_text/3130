The Awami National Party formation
In 1986, the National Democratic Party merged with several other progressive political and nationalist groups to form the Awami National Party. Abdul Wali Khan was elected as its president and Sindhi nationalist Rasul Bakh Palijo was elected its secretary general. Abdul Wali Khan is the son of Pashtun non-violence advocate, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, who was a friend of Mahatma Gandhi. 1
The strongholds of ANP are in the Pashtun areas of Pakistan, particularly the North-West Frontier Province.
