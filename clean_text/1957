After recovering from a serious back injury on his return, Pelter moved to New Zealand Football Championship team Canterbury United in 2005.5 Due to the semi-professional nature of football in New Zealand, Pelter had to take on other jobs to finance his football regime, with his mother later commenting &quot;After training, he'd go to work in a bar until two in the morning to fund his career, he was running, training and swimming on his own, he used to get up on cold mornings on his own to go running&quot;.6
