History
Part of the building of the Hotel Laurus al Duomo was the ancient location of the Oratory of the &lt;U+201C&gt;Societas Beati Bartolomei&lt;U+201D&gt;, whose protector was Saint Bartholomew.2 In Via de&lt;U+2019&gt; Cerretani, till the mid 19th century, stood the palaces of the Carnesecchi and the Cappelli houses.3 When Florence became Italy&lt;U+2019&gt;s capital city (1864-1870), the area was reorganized one first time. A new reorganization took place in the 1930s and Via de&lt;U+2019&gt; Cerretani was widened. Many medieval buildings were pulled down and replaced by modern palaces4
 
In the 1970s an important restoration of the building begun but the historic 1800 fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade was maintained. During the 1966 Flood of the Arno River the hotel was under construction . Only the basements, the stairs and the third floor garret had been built. Probably these structures prevented the tumbling down of the nearby edifices. In 1972 part of the building was turned into a first class 4 stars hotel with the name of &lt;U+201C&gt;Laurus&lt;U+201D&gt;, to keep some memory of the ancient history of the area and in particular of the laurel grove placed between Via dell&lt;U+2019&gt;Alloro and Via del Giglio. In 1989 the Hotel Laurus al Duomo was acquired by the hotel company Vivahotels. In 2004 the hotel was restored once again to the shape it has today.
