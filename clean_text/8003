Magazine Street is a major thoroughfare in New Orleans, Louisiana. Like Tchoupitoulas Street, St. Charles Avenue, and Claiborne Avenue, it follows the course of the Mississippi River.
Description
The upper end of the street begins at Leake Avenue, a part of River Road, where it turns away from the river in the Carrollton riverbend. The street follows the length of the crescent through Uptown. When the street reaches Canal Street, it becomes Decatur Street.
In the Lower Garden District, Magazine Street becomes one-way in the upriver direction; downriver traffic forks to join Camp Street, the next street away from the river. The two streets continue a block apart through the Central Business District to Canal Street. Camp Street becomes Chartres Street in the French Quarter.
Near the upper end, the street runs between Audubon Park and the Audubon Zoo. Most of the street is a mix of residential and commercial buildings, generally older houses from the later nineteenth century and similarly aged commercial stretches consisting of antique shops, clothing boutiques, restaurants, and bars.
Like many New Orleans streets, Magazine is particularly narrow along the two-way section despite being an RTA bus route.
