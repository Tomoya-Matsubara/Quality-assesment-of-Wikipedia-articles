Shinano Japanese:, named after the ancient Shinano Province, was an aircraft carrier of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II.  Initially laid down as the third of the Yamato class battleship Yamato class battleships, Shinano's partially complete hull was converted to an aircraft carrier in 1942, midway through construction.  Over the next two years, Shinano was heavily modified to act as a large support carrier.  When completed, she had a full-load displacement of 72,000 tons, the largest pre-1954 aircraft carrier built.

Commissioned in November 1944, Shinano was to transfer from Yokosuka to Kure, Hiroshima Kure Naval Base to complete her fitting out.  While en-route, Shinano was sunk by the submarine USS Archer-Fish SS-311 6 ten days after her commissioning; the result of severe design flaws and poor damage control. Shinano was largest vessel in history to have ever been sunk by a submarine.

Design and Construction
File:Shinano photo.jpg thumb left Shinano underway, in what was the only official photo of her ever taken

Shinano was initially designed as the third Yamato class battleship Yamato class battleship of the Imperial Japanese Navy, with her keel laid down in June 1940 at the Yokosuka Naval Dockyard.Preston, p. 84  Named after the ancient Shinano Province, the vessel would have been one of the three largest battleships ever constructed.  In Summer 1941, construction on Shinano's hull was temporarily suspended, so as to allow personnel and equipment to be utilized for other naval projects in response to approaching hostilities.Preston, p. 91  Had she been completed as a battleship, her armament and armour would have been nearly identical to that of Japanese battleship Yamato Yamato and Japanese battleship Musashi Musashi.

Following Japan's disastrous losses at the Battle of Midway&mdash;in which four of Japan's six fleet carriers were lost&mdash;the decision was made to convert Shinano's unfinished hull to an Aircraft Carrier.  In June 1942, her construction as a Yamato class battleship was halted, and she was gradually converted to an aircraft carrier.Cite web  url= http://combinedfleet.com/Shinano.htm  title= Combined Fleet - tabular history of Shinano accessdate=27 January 2009  work=  publisher=Parshall, Jon; Bob Hackett, Sander Kingsepp, & Allyn Nevitt  date=  The conversion process placed a heavy emphasis on flight-deck armour, similar to the design of the British Illustrious class aircraft carrier Illustrious class aircraft carriers.  The flight-deck was designed to withstand 1,000 pound bombs, the largest in the arsenal of the United States Navy that could be carried by dive-bombers.  Shinano was also primarily designed as a support-carrier, with extensive facilities for aircraft repair and refitting.  Shinano herself was intended to have a small fighter complement for defensive purposes, but was not intended to act as a fleet carrier.Cite web  url= http://combinedfleet.com/ship.php?q=shinan_c.htm  title= Shinano class aircraft carrier accessdate=27 January 2009  work=  publisher=Parshall, Jon; Bob Hackett, Sander Kingsepp, & Allyn Nevitt  date= Shinano was officially launched  5 October 1944, with Captain Toshio Abe in overall command of the vessel.  With a total displacement of 72,000 tons, Shinano was the largest aircraft carrier constructed before 1954.Preston, p. 91. USS Forrestal CV-59 6, launched in 1954, displaced 80,000 tons.

The ship's very existence was kept a closely-guarded secret. A tall fence was erected on three sides of the graving dock, and those working on the conversion were confined to the yard compound. Serious punishmentup to and including deathawaited anyone who breathed a word about Japan's new carrier. As a result, Shinano was the only major warship built in the 20th century to have never been officially photographed during its construction.cite book  last=Enright  first=Joseph  authorlink=  coauthors=James W.

Armament
Shinano's armament differed radically from that of Japan's other aircraft carriers.  Shinano's primary defensive armament took the form of 16 convert 5 in cm adj=on guns.  Her antiaircraft armament was also significant: 125 convert 1 in mm adj=on antiaircraft guns, and 336 convert 5 in cm adj=on antiaircraft rocket launchers in 12 28-barrel turrets.  Shinano was also built to contain a maximum of 120 aircraft within her 870-foot hull.

Commissioning and Loss
On 19 November 1944, Shinano was formally commissioned at Yokosuka, having spent the previous two weeks fitting out and performing minor trials.  As a result of growing worry for her safety, Japanese Naval Command ordered Shinano to Kure, Hiroshima Kure, where the remainder of her fitting-out would take place.  On 28 November 1944, Shinano departed Yokosuka, with an escort of three destroyers, bound for Kure.  At the time of her departure, the majority of her watertight compartment doors had yet to be installed,and the ship had not been tested for watertightness.  On her voyage to Kure, Shinano carried a crew of 2,176 officers and men, as well as 300 shipyard workers and 40 civilian employees. It also carried six Shinyo suicide-boats, and fifty Ohka rockets.

At 21:00 on 28 November, the American submarine USS Archer-Fish SS-311 2 picked up Shinano's taskgroup on her radar.Wheeler, p. 184  Although Shinano was faster than Archer-Fish, the sub was able to remain in pursuit of Shinano due to the zig-zagging pattern of Shinano and her escorts.  At 03:00 on 29 November, Captain Joseph F. Enright fired six shallow-running torpedoes at Shinano, with four striking the starboard side between the anti-torpedo bulge and the waterline.  Enright later said he'd deliberately set the torpedoes to run shallow in order to capsize the target.  Shinano's destroyer escorts pursued Archer-Fish, forcing the sub to dive.

Though severe, the damage to Shinano was at first judged to be manageable, and the carrier continued under way.  However, progressive flooding over the next four hours caused Shinano to list to starboard.  Archer-Fish's crew later reported that Shinano was already listing minutes after the last torpedo hit. At dawn, Captain Abe ordered three of the outboard boiler rooms counter-flooded.  Thirty-six miles from where the torpedoes struck, Shinano's boiler water feed failed shortly afterwards.  All efforts to control the flooding failed, in part because most of the crew was not well-trained in damage control.

At 07:45, Shinano lost all power.  At 08:50, two of Shinano's escorts took her under tow, attempting to beach her on Cape Ushio.  When the carrier continued to list to starboard, the tow-line had to be abandoned.  At 10:18, Abe gave the order to abandon ship, as Shinano's list continued to increase. At 10:57 on 29 November, Shinano capsized and sank at coord 32 0 N 137 0 E diaply=inline,title, taking 1,400 of her 2,400 crew with her, including Captain Abe and both his navigators.Wheeler, p. 185 The survivors of Shinano's sinking were quarantined in Japan for several months following her sinking.

Postwar Analysis of the Sinking

Postwar analysis by the US Naval Technical Mission to Japan concluded that Shinano had serious design flaws.Technical Reports, p. 26 Specifically, the joint between the antiprojectile armor on the hull and the anti-torpedo bulge on the underwater body was poorly designed; Archer-Fish's torpedoes all exploded along this joint. Additionally, the force of the torpedo explosions dislodged an H-beam in one of the boiler rooms. The dislodged beam turned into a giant battering ram that punched a hole between two of the boiler rooms. In addition, the failure to test for watertightness played a role.Technical Reports, p. 27 Survivors claimed that they were unable to control the flooding because the water poured in too fast; some claimed to have seen rivets between seams burst and allow water to surge through.
