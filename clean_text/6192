Congregation Beth Israel is an egalitarian1 Conservative synagogue located at 6880 North Green Bay Road in Glendale, Wisconsin, a suburb north of Milwaukee.
Originally founded in 1884 as Congregation B'ne Jacob, the congregation split, re-amalgamated, and went bankrupt before re-organizing as Beth Israel in 1901.2 The synagogue building it constructed on Teutonia Avenue in 1925, and sold in 1959, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.34
Led by Rabbi Jacob Haber, as of 2008 it is the only synagogue in Milwaukee associated with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism.5
Early years
In 1884 the Congregation B'ne Jacob was formed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. By 1886 it had split into two congregations, Moses Montefiore Gemeinde and Anshe Jacob. In 1891 they re-amalgamated, creating Beth Hamedrash Hagadol, and the following year hired Solomon Isaac Scheinfeld as the congregation's first permanent rabbi.6 Scheinfeld had been born in Lithuania in 1860, and had moved to Milwaukee soon after receiving semicha in 1890.7 He would stay less than a year before moving to Kentucky.8
The congregation completed a new synagogue building at 462 Fifth Street in 1893, but was unable to afford the mortgage, and in 1900 the courts foreclosed on the property. The following year the congregation was re-organized as Congregation Beth Israel and re-acquired the synagogue building on Fifth Street, and in 1902 Scheinfeld was re-hired as rabbi.9 He would go on to serve as Beth Israel's rabbi until his death in 1943.10
During his tenure as rabbi, Scheinfeld established a maot chitim (literally &quot;money for wheat&quot;) fund, to provide for the needs of Milwaukee Jews too poor to afford food for the Passover Seder. That fund continued after his death as the &quot;Rabbi Solomon I. Scheinfeld Moath Chitim Fund&quot;, and in 2003 distributed $20,000 worth of food to 600 families.11
Teutonia building
Beth Israel sold its Fifth Street building in 1924, and, after meeting in temporary quarters for a year, constructed a new building at 2432 North Teutonia Avenue.1213 However, as the Jewish community of Milwaukee migrated north to suburbs in the 1940s and 1950s, the location became inconvenient. In 1957, a 15 acre property was purchased at 6880 North Green Bay Road in Glendale, a suburb north of Milwaukee, and construction began on new facilities there in 1959.14 The Tuetonia Avenue building was sold in 1959, and vacated in 1960.15 On March 5, 1992 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.16
Move from Orthodox to Conservative Judaism
Beth Israel was originally founded as an Orthodox synagogue, and its rabbi, Solomon Scheinfeld, also served as chief rabbi of the United Orthodox Congregations of Milwaukee.17 However, the congregation had done away with separate seating for men and women in 1920s or 30s; at the same time Beth Israel also instituted English language sermons.18 The congregation would eventually become fully egalitarian,19 and associate with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism.20
1960s to 1990s
Beth Israel's current facilities were built in three phases.21 In 1962 a new school building was completed, and the congregation began holding services there. In 1966, the sanctuary building and social hall were completed and dedicated, and in 1980 work on the sanctuary was completed.22
In 1970, Herbert Panitch joined Beth Israel from Congregation Agudath Achim in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He would serve as rabbi until his retirement in 1995.2324
Recent events
Jacob Herber, a graduate of the Jewish Theological Seminary and the University of California, Davis, became rabbi of Beth Israel in August 2003.25 Funded by congregation members and the Milwaukee Jewish Federation, he traveled to Uganda in July 2008 to assist in the Abayudaya in converting to Judaism.26
As of 2008, Beth Israel is the only synagogue in Milwaukee associated with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism,27 and currently has 700 member families.28 The rabbi is Jacob Herber, the rabbi emeritus is Herbert Panitch, the cantor is Mitchell Martin, and the president is Ralph Schapira.29
