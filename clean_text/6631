Tropical Cyclone



The 1999-00 Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone season ran year-round from July 1, 1999 to June 30, 2000, reaching its peak mid-February to early March.
Cyclones Leon-Eline, Steve and Rosita were some of the most notable cyclones of the season. Cyclone Leon-Eline existed for 22 days, while transversing the whole Indian Ocean, and causing severe flooding in Madagascar and Mozambique. Cyclone Steve transversed the entire Australian continent, and although a fairly weak cyclone, caused widespread flooding in Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. Cyclone Rosita made an almost direct hit on Broome as a severe Category 5 cyclone, devastating several remote stations and the town itself. Rosita surprised many residents of its arrival, as it made landfall very late in the season.

South-West Indian Ocean
Severe Tropical Storm Astride

On 24 December, 1999, a low formed about 240 nm southeast of Diego Garcia and moved westward. The disturbance was upgraded to tropical depression status on 25 December 1800 hours (UTC), and upgraded to moderate tropical storm intensity on 26 December and named Astride. It moved to the west south-west and reached severe tropical storm intensity on 27 December 0000 (UTC) with 10-min MSW near 50 kts, located 190 nm north-east of St. Brandon. Astride slowed its forward motion while intensifying (JTWC estimated 1-min winds of 65 kts). Astride began to slowly weaken from early 28 December. On 30 December Astride intensified and was upgraded again to severe tropical storm intensity while moving to the west north-west, but downgraded again to moderate storm intensity at 1800 (UTC) on the same day. Astride made landfall between 1800 (UTC) on 31 December and 0000 (UTC) on 1 January, 2000 30 nm northeast of Vohemar, Madagascar. It moved into the Mozambique Channel and intensified briefly, but weakened again, and made another landfall near Mogincual, Mozambique at 0000 (UTC) on 3 January. 1
Severe Tropical Storm Astride is the only known cyclone in history to exist in two different millenia, forming on December 24, 1999 and dissipated on January 3, 2000.
Tropical Cyclone Babiola

An area of convection formed 130 nm south south-east of Diego Garcia. It moved eastward, then moved southwest and strengthened. MFR upgraded to a depression on the 6th at 0000 (UTC) and upgraded to Moderate Tropical Storm Babiola at 0600 (UTC) on the same day. It continued to move south-west, then accelerated more to the west southwest while reaching cyclone strength on 7 January at 1200 (UTC), centred 575 nm south of Diego Garcia. Babiola reached peak intensity late on 9 january and a ragged eye appeared 20 nm in diameter. JTWC estimated 1-min winds of 90 kts, and MFR estimated 10-min winds of 80 kts and a minimum central pressure of 954 mb. Babiola moved southward on the 10th and began to weaken and became elongated. It continued to weaken on the 11th while moving to the south south-east and becoming extra-tropical. JTWC issued its last warning on 12 January at 0600 (UTC). No damage was reported. 2
Intense Tropical Cyclone Connie

An area of convection appeared on 24 January. It quickly strengthened to tropical storm status on the 25th at 1800 (UTC) and was named Connie. The storm moved northward a bit, but remained quasi-stationary about 380 nm north north-west of Mauritius. MFR upgraded Connie to cyclone status with 80 kt winds. Connie strengthened rapidly and on 27 January, a well-defined eye 15 nm wide was located 235 nm northwest of Mauritius. JTWC estimated 1-min winds of 115 kts, and MFR estimated 10-min winds of 100 kts and a minimum central pressure of 928 mb on 28 January. Connie moved to the south west which carried it 100 nm west of Reunion and began weakening. Connie recurved to the south south-east on the 30th. On the 31st Connie held on its intensity of 55 kts, then rapidly weakened on 1 February and was taking on extratropical characteristics while moving south-eastward.
Connie affected the islands of Mauritius and Reunion, dumping rainfall up to 200mm. In Mauritius, this provided some relief for the drought-stricken island, but was still not enough. Connie was responsible for two deaths in Reunion. One hundred homes were destroyed with at least 600 people homeless. 3
Moderate Tropical Storm Damienne

On January 31, 2000 a low formed in the central south Indian Ocean about 300 nm south-east of Diego Garcia. On February 1 the storm reached tropical storm strength and was named Damienne. It moved southward with 1-min winds estimated at 45 kts by JTWC, and 10-min winds of 40 kts estimated by MFR. Although forecast to strengthen, the storm did not last long and it quickly dissipated on February 2 while moving south-westward. 4 
Intense Tropical Cyclone Leon-Eline
See the South-East Indian Ocean/Western Australia section below.
Severe Tropical Storm Felicia

A low formed on 17 February near 13&lt;U+02DA&gt;S, 81&lt;U+02DA&gt;E. It was classified a tropical storm br MFR on the 20th at 0000 (UTC) while located 500 nm south southeast of Diego Garcia and was named Felicia. It moved west southwestward which later became south westward. It was temporarily downgraded to a depression at 1800 (UTC), but upgraded again 12 hours later. On 23 February, it reached its peak intensity. JTWC estimated 1-min winds of 50 kts, but MFR estimated 10-min winds of 60 kts. Felicia continued to move to the south southwest, but it weakened rapidly thereafter. MFR issued its final warning on 24 February at 0600 (UTC) as it transitioned into an extratropical low, located 665 nm south south-east of Rodrigues Island. 5 
Moderate Tropical Storm Gloria

An area of convection east of northern Madagascar formed on 27 February. MFR started issuing bulletins on 28 February at 0600 (UTC) when the system was located 600 nm east of northern Madagascar. It was upgraded to a depression on 29 February at 0000 (UTC) while moving westward, and started moving more northerly. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gloria on 1 March at 0600 (UTC) and turned to the south-west at 9 kts. Gloria's centre made landfall near Antsirabe, Madagascar around 1800 (UTC). JTWC's estimated 1-min average sustained winds was 65 kts, based on infrared imagery showing a 15 nm wide closed eye along the coast. MFR's estimated 10-min average wind speed was somewhat lower at 45 kts. On 2 March at 0600 (UTC), MFR issued its last warning. JTWC continued to monitor the system for the next three days as it drifted south-westward over Madagascar. JTWC was consistently forecasting re-intensification over the Mozambique Channel, but on 5 March, the system weakened, and the final warning was written while over the Channel.
Tropical Storm Gloria brought heavy rainfall to northern Madagascar. Mananjary recordded 427 mm in a 48 hour period ending on 5 March. The death toll was about 150. Andapa was the most affected city, with 40 people dead and 33 unaccounted for. Over 100 homes were destroyed in the city. The population was affected by an outbreak of cholera. The road linking this region to the capital was blocked, and this was expected to have a significant negative impact on the region's economy. 6
Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Hudah

Cyclone Hudah was an intense and long-lived tropical cyclone that rampaged through the South Indian Ocean from March 24 to April 9, causing massive damage in Madagascar and Mozambique. Striking nearly the same area barely a month after Cyclone Leon-Eline roared through the two countries, the combination severely damaged the fragile economies of Southern Africa.  
Moderate Tropical Storm Innocente

An area of disturbance was located on 9 April between Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island. It moved west for a few days. MFR began issuing bulletins, as the low crossed the 90 degree East longitude line on 12 April at 1800 (UTC). It still moved westward; on the 14th, it weakened, and the issuing of bulletins were temporarily stopped, however, they were re-instigated on the 15th, as it regenerated. JTWC began issuing warnings at 1800 (UTC) on the same day, while located 640 nm southeast of Diego Garcia. At 1200 (UTC) on the 16th April, MFR upgraded to Tropical Storm Innocente, but was downgraded back to a depression six hours later. On 17 April at 1800 (UTC), MFR upgraded to Tropical Storm Innocente again. It was still moving in a west south-westerly course and began to weaken. At 0000 (UTC) on the 19th April, MFR downgraded it to a depression, and wrote their final warning six hours later, while located 400 nm east northeast of Rodrigues Island. The remnant low remained for several days, but failed to show any redevelopment. 7 
South-East Indian Ocean/Western Australia
Tropical Cyclone Ilsa

Ilsa formed to the northeast of the Cocos Islands on the December 11, 1999. The cyclone moved to the south of Christmas Island on the 13th producing a heavy swell which caused some damage. Its development was impeded by vertical windshear for a large part of its lifetime. After a long track eastwards across the Indian Ocean it eventually crossed the Western Australian coastline on the Eighty Mile Beach near the Sandfire Roadhouse during the early afternoon of December 17, 1999. Apart from producing heavy rainfall, Ilsa did not produce any significant damage. 8 
Severe Tropical Cyclone John

Tropical Cyclone John started as a low to the south-west of Timor on 9 December 1999. It rapidly intensified and moved towards the Pilbara coast of Western Australia. Just before landfall it was a severe category 5 storm with a central pressure of 915 hPa, with winds estimated at being up to 290 km/h. The cyclone crossed the coast just to the west of Whim Creek between Port Hedland and Karratha on 8.30am (WST) December 15,1999. At the time of coastal crossing, it was estimated to have a central pressure between 930 and 940 hPa. The cyclone moved inland before dissipating the next day.
Port Hedland experienced gale force winds for a period of 18 hours and near storm force winds with gusts to 124 km/h were observed on December 15 for most of the day. A maximum storm surge of 2 metres was recorded by the Port Hedland Authority at 6am WST. At Karratha, on the western side of the circulation, the maximum wind gust recorded was 113 km/h. At Cape Lambert, winds averaged 150 km/h for 5 hours with a maximum gust of 210 km/h. 9
There was some minor damage in Karratha. High winds and flooding caused extensive structural damage at many stations in the Pilbara and mining operations were suspended at many sites. The 113-year old Whim Creek Hotel suffered major damage with the top floor lost, and the town of Newman experienced some flooding (500 mm of rain was recorded). However, major towns in the Pilbara escaped any serious damage, and the damage was relatively light due to the sparseness of population in the area John hit. There were no deaths from John. 10
Ten hours prior to landfall on the Australian coastline, John was moving southwards directly towards Karratha and Dampier. Had John failed to turn to the south-east like what it did, damage to the towns of Karratha, Dampier, Roebourne and Wickham caused by John would have been much worse. 11
Severe Tropical Cyclone Kirrily

Tropical Cyclone Kirrily formed about 350 kilometres east of the Cocos Islands on January 24, 2000 and moved west southwest towards the Western Australian coast. Kirrily intensified, reaching Category 2 status on January 27. On January 28, Kirrily turned southwest, moving away from the coast, weakening to below cyclone strength by January 31, while located approximately 900 km west of Carnarvon. The lowest central pressure was estimated to have reached 970 hPa. 12 
Severe Tropical Cyclone Leon-Eline


A developing low approximately 230 km south of Christmas Island on the 3rd February was named Leon on the 4th February. Following a general southwesterly track during the 5th and 6th, the system developed into a severe tropical cyclone with an estimated central pressure of 960 hPa. By the 8th, Tropical Cyclone Leon passed to the south of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. 13 Leon was re-named Leon-Eline once it moved outside Perth's area of responsibility. Leon-Eline moved through the Indian Ocean towards Africa and drenched Madagascar and Mozambique with heavy rains and gusty winds. Leon-Eline caused severe damage in its path. It dissipated over the African mainland on February 23.
Tropical Cyclone Marcia
Marcia was a Category 1 cyclone that formed on February 15, and remained quasi-stationary in the open Indian Ocean at around 15&lt;U+02DA&gt;S, 103&lt;U+02DA&gt;E. Perth issued its final warning on February 17 at 0400 hours UTC, downgrading to a tropical low. Marcia dissipated on February 21. The lowest central pressure was 992hPa achieved on February 16 at 1000 hours UTC. 14
Severe Tropical Cyclone Norman

Severe Tropical Cyclone Norman developed from a low that moved off the west Kimberley coast on 29 February, 2000. The cyclone tracked parallel to the Pilbara coastline for 3 days at a distance of about 250 kilometres, before continuing on a westward track away from the Western Australian coast. Norman quickly reached a category 5 cyclone on 2 March with a central pressure estimated at 920 hPa, while about 780 km to the westnorthwest of Exmouth. Norman soon weakened over the following 2 days. During the 6th of March, the cyclone changed direction to a southerly track. The system finally dissipated on 8 March. Norman had no direct impact on Western Australia. 15 
Tropical Cyclone Steve
See the Coral Sea/Eastern Australia section below.
Tropical Cyclone Olga

Olga formed from a low that developed in the Timor Sea on 15 March, 2000. The low maintained a west southwest track, paralleling the Kimberley and Pilbara coasts. The low was named Tropical Cyclone Olga on 17 March while located approximately 570 km to the north of Exmouth. Olga intensified to category 2 status with a central pressure of 980 hPa. By the 20th the system had weakened to a tropical low while located about 970 km to the west of Carnarvon. The system had no direct effect on Western Australia. 16 
Severe Tropical Cyclone Paul

Paul formed about 1000 kilometres north of Karratha on 13 April, 2000 and moved west, away from the West Australian coastline, thus never posing any threat to coastal communities. The cyclone showed rapid intensification and Severe Tropical Cyclone Paul reached Category 5 status during the 15th April, and the lowest central pressure was estimated to be have been about 920 hPa the following day. Severe Tropical Cyclone Paul passed about 200 km to the south of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands during the 17th and the central pressure was estimated to be about 940 hPa. Wind gusts at Cocos Islands were in the order of 50 km/h. TC Paul continued to weaken as the system followed a general west-south-west track across the Indian Ocean. The cyclone slowed to be almost stationary on 20 April and weakened to below cyclone strength. Perth issued the final warning for TC Paul on the 20th April when the Category 1 cyclone was in the vicinity of latitude 14.7&lt;U+00B0&gt; south and longitude 94.3&lt;U+00B0&gt; east. 17 
Severe Tropical Cyclone Rosita


Rosita was named on April 17 while located 670 km north of Port Hedland. It rapidly intensified into a Category 5 storm on 19 April while moving to the east south-east. Rosita struck the Kimberley coast as a Category 5 at 0100 hours (WST) on 20 April, 2000, 40 km south of Broome. Its lowest central pressure was estimated to be 930 hPa a couple of hours prior to landfall. The small cyclone left severe structural damage in Eco Beach tourist resort, Yardoogarra and Thangoo Stations. Elsewhere there was considerable tree and powerline damage. 18 
Arafura Sea and Gulf of Carpentaria/Northern Australia
Tropical Cyclone Steve
See the Coral Sea/Eastern Australia section below.
Coral Sea/Eastern Australia
Tropical Cyclone Steve


A long lived cyclone lasting 13 days, Steve actually made landfall on various parts of Australia four times. It formed on February 27, 2000 and crossed the Queensland coast north of Cairns the same day as a strong Category 2 in the Australian Scale. It weakened to a low and then redeveloped in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Steve then crossed into the Northern Territory and weakened again. The low then moved over the Indian Ocean near Broome and reformed again into a tropical cyclone. It intensified into a strong Category 2, reaching its peak intensity, and made landfall to the west of Karratha. It weakened to a Category 1 and emerged again over the Indian Ocean near Carnarvon. It finally made its fourth landfall as a weak Category 1 on March 9, 2000 near Shark Bay. It accelerated to the south-east towards Esperance and emerged over the Great Australian Bight where it became extratropical. 19
There was extensive damage across a wide area of Australia, from Cairns in Queensland to Esperance in Western Australia on 11 March. Most of the damage was caused by severe flooding which resulted with costs in excess of $100 million (AUD). There were no reports of deaths from Cyclone Steve. 20
Tropical Cyclone Tessi

A tropical low in the northern Coral Sea moved toward the coast, deepened into Tropical Cyclone Tessi on 2 April and crossed the coast near Bambaroo and Crystal Creek (80km north of Townsville) early on 3 April as a Category 2 system on landfall.
Tessi's winds unroofed buildings, uprooted trees, downed power lines in the area between Ingham and Ayr. The Strand suffered wave damage with several boats destroyed. Heavy rain caused landslides on Townsville's Castle Hill destroying two homes and requiring the evacuation of another fifty homes. Considerable damage to personal property and to Townsville City infrastructure was reported. Townsville Aero reported a record April wind gust of 130km/h, a record April daily rainfall total of 271.6mm and the cyclone was the main contribution to a record April monthly total of 546.2mm.
Minor to moderate flooding in the Haughton River increased to major in the lower reaches with the highest level since the start of records in 1978 being recorded at Giru. 21
Tropical Cyclone Vaughan

A tropical low was first identified near New Caledonia on the 29 March. The low tracked northwest through the Coral Sea to become Tropical Cyclone Vaughan early on the 4 April. The system rapidly intensified to Category 2 during the morning of the 4th and tracked westward toward the north Queensland tropical coast. TC Vaughan weakened a little during the 5 April and was downgraded to a Category 1 system before re-intensifying to Category 2 early on the 6 April. However by late morning on the 6th the system again rapidly weakened and was downgraded below cyclone strength during the afternoon. The remnants of TC Vaughan drifted slowly northwest and dissipated during the 7th April. There was no evidence of any significant impact on the coast from TC Vaughan. 22 
South Pacific/Fiji
Tropical Cyclone Iris

A disturbance was identified on 3 January at 0600 (UTC) near Espiritu Santo in Vanuatu. The storm was difficult to locate the general centre for the next couple of days, but on 6 January, it became more organised, while displaying midget characteristics. On 7 January at 2100 (UTC), it was named Tropical Cyclone Iris, located 180 nm northwest of Port Vila, moving southeast. In Vila, 60 nm away from Iris's centre, recorded winds of only up to 20 kts, explaining the very small size of the cyclone. Iris intensified with 10-min winds increasing to 60 kts on 8 January at 1200 (UTC). JTWC's estimated 1-min winds was 65 kts. There were some indications that Iris could be far more intense than what the warning centres estimated, mainly due to its small size. Iris accelerated eastward, leaving Vanuatu. On 9 January, Iris began its weakening trend, while moving closer to Fiji. Iris was downgraded to a depression on 10 January, just 48 hours after it had reached its peak intensity. The final warning placed the centre on the Dateline 150 nm southeast of Fiji.
Fresh to strong winds and very rough seas were experienced over the western and southern parts of Fiji. Overall damage was minimal. Cyclone Iris was most notable for its rapid strengthening in its early stages, followed by its rapid decay. 23 
Tropical Cyclone Jo

A disturbance was first identified over northern parts of Vanuatu on 19 January. It developed slowly, but deepened quickly on 22 January, and advisories were issued on the system on 23 January. It moved southward and was upgraded to Tropical Cyclone Jo on 24 January at 0300 (UTC). Jo moved to the south-east and attained storm force winds 15 hours after being named. The cyclone reached its peak intensity on 26 January at 0000 (UTC) located 350 nm south of Nadi, with 10-min average winds of 60 kts. JTWC's peak 1-min average winds were 65 kts. Jo moved further to the south-east, and moved close enough to affect Fiji. Gusts to 50 kts were recorded on Viti Levu on Fiji, even though Jo was about 240 nm away from the Fiji. Flash flooding was reported, but there was no major river flooding. Cyclone Jo was declared extratropical on 28 January at 0600 (UTC) when located more than 1000 nm east of North Island in New Zealand. 24 
Tropical Cyclone Kim

Cyclone Kim formed south east of French Polynesia on February 23, 2000. It initially developed little but late on 24 February, the depression developed rapidly, and the storm reached tropical storm strength at 1800 (UTC), named Tropical Cyclone Kim. It was located about 40 nm west of Rikitea or about 200 nm southeast of Mururoa. Cyclone Kim reached hurricane strength on 25 February, only 18 hours after being named, while moving to the south-west. The storm reached its peak intensity of 80 kts on 26 February at 1200 (UTC), loacted more than 700 nm east of Tahiti. Minimum pressure at this time was 955 mb. The estimated 1-min average winds from NPMOC was 100 kts. Kim gradually weakened over cooler waters, still moving to the south-west. Cyclone Kim became extratropical south of Tahiti on February 29 at 0600 (UTC).
Damage from Kim was minimal from Rikitea, since it was only a depression at the time. The island recorded 10-min average winds of 27 kts, with a peak gust of 52 kts and a minimum pressure of 996 mb. As a hurricane, the island of Rapa recorded a gust of 74 kts, when Kim was 80 nm away from the island. A pressure of 995.8 mb was recorded. Overall, damage in French Polynesia was minor. 25 
Tropical Cyclone Leo

Tropical Depression 14F was first identified on 4 March at 0600 UTC, almost stationary, and located 60 nm west-northwest of French Polynesia. The depression drifted south-westward in the next 24 hours. The first gale warning was issued at 0000 UTC on the 5th, located 300 nm west-southwest of Tahiti. The depression moved through the southern Cook Islands and slowly developed, but suddenly developed explosively on 6 March at 0600 UTC while located near Rarotonga. It was named Leo at 1200 UTC on the 6th. It accelerated to the south-southwest and reached a peak intensity of 50 kts on the 7th at 0000 UTC. After 1800 UTC, Leo recurved to the southeast and became extratropical six hours later. Although, Leo moved over the island of Mangaia, any damage was minor. 26 
Tropical Cyclone Mona

As Leo was developing, a new disturbance formed south of Apia in Western Samoa. The first gale warning was issued on 7 March as it moved closer to northern Tonga. Wind warnings were issued for some islands in Tonga including Vavau, Haapai and Tongatapu. The storm rapidly developed on 8 March at 0600 UTC, and was named Tropical Cyclone Mona six hours later, while located 40 nm west of Haapai and moving slowly southward. A storm warning was put for the whole Tongatapu Group on the 8th. An eye developed on 9 March, and Mona was upgraded to hurricane intensity at 0600 UTC, located 30 nm west of Tongatapu. Mona moved south-southeastward and accelerated. It reached an intensity of 70 kts on 10 March at 0600 UTC, 200 nm southeast of Tongatapu. NPMOC's 1-min winds were estimated at 80 kts. Minimum pressure of Mona was 965 mb. It began to weaken rapidly, as it sped off southwards, and became extratropical on 11 March at 1200 UTC.
In the Vavau and Haapai groups, there was damage to crops, particularly to banana and coconut plantations. There was moderate damage to houses and school buildings in Tongatapu. The unofficial damage assessment, according to the Tongan National Disaster Management Office, totalled Tongan $6 million. A police patrol boat sank off Eua Island in the Tongatapu group. 27 
Tropical Cyclone Neil

The sixth and last cyclone was first identified northeast of Fiji on 12 April. It moved to the south-west while continually strengthening. By the 15 April the potential for development to a cyclone was considered &quot;high&quot; by RSMC Nadi. At 1700 UTC, it was named Tropical Cyclone Neil, located 80 nm southeast of Kadavu. It moved slowly southward, but on 16 April at 1200 UTC, it was downgraded to a tropical depression.
Damage from Neil was minimal. Kadavu and Ono-i-Lau in Fiji reported gales from Neil, while torrential rain was experienced over some parts of Fiji. There was one fatality due to drowning, but not directly associated with the cyclone. 28
