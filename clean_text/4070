The village sits on the crossroads of the A6106 Earlston to Duns road and the A6089 Edinburgh to Kelso road, it is 6 miles east of Earlston and 4 miles west of Greenlaw at 
Gordon was once on a branch line of the Berwickshire Railway.1
Origins
Thr origins are unclear but the name is said to derive from the Gaelic 'Gor Dun' meaning great fort. In the 12th century, King David I of Scotland 2 granted the lands to a Norman nobleman by the name of Adam. Adam assumed the name of the land and became known as 'de Gordon'. Adam had two sons, Richard and Adam and, it's thought, the two main branches of the great family are descended from the sons. The father, Adam de Gordon died at the Battle of the Standard at Northallerton in Yorkshire on the 22nd. August, 1138.3 The de Gordons held the lairdship of Gordon for over two centuries and were thought to have built a castle at the former hamlet of Huntly just to the north; they still held lands up to the 18th century.4 The Gordon family are the ancestors of the Dukes of Richmond and Gordon and of the Marquis of Huntly.5.
Church

The present church was built in 1763 and is a part of the Church of Scotland.6. A Free Church of Scotland was opened in 1843 7 but that is now used as a private home.
Greenknowe Tower
In 1408, Alexander Seton married Elizabeth Gordon, heiress of the Gordon family,8 and they were granted lands at Greenknowe, just to the west of the village. A descendent of the family, James Seton of Touch, married Janet Edmonstone and it was they who built the tower in 1581. Their initials IS/IE (the 'I' is Latin for 'J') are carved above the entrance.9 Later owners of the tower were Walter Pringle of Stichill, the Covenanter and the Dalrymple family. The tower is now in the care of Historic Scotland.1011
Today
Modern Gordon boasts a Church of Scotland kirk, a nursery, a primary school. a lawn bowling club, a community woodland, village hall, two public houses and the village shop/post office. The main street has not changed for many years though there has been much housing development at the north end of the village off Station Road.
