Human immunodeficiency virus HIV is a retrovirus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS, a condition in humans in which the immune system begins to fail, leading to life-threatening opportunistic infections. Previous names for the virus include human T-lymphotropic virus-III HTLV-III, lymphadenopathy-associated virus LAV, and AIDS-associated retrovirus ARV.cite web  author=Rick Sowadsky  year=1999  url=http://thebody.org/Forums/AIDS/safesex/Archive/origins/Q8777.html  title=What is HTLV-III?  accessdate=2006-08-24cite journal

Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, semen, vaginal fluid, pre-ejaculate, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells. The three major routes of transmission are unprotected sex unprotected sexual intercourse, contaminated needles, and transmission from an infected mother to her baby at childbirth birth, or through breast milk. Screening of blood products for HIV in the developed world has largely eliminated transmission through blood transfusions or infected blood products in these countries. 

HIV infection in humans is now pandemic. As of 2006 As of January 2006, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS UNAIDS and the World Health Organization WHO estimate that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized on December 1, 1981, making it one of the most destructive AIDS pandemic pandemics in recorded history. In 2005 alone, AIDS claimed an estimated 2.4&ndash;3.3 million lives, of which more than 570,000 were children. It is estimated that about 0.6% of the world's living population is infected with HIV.cite book

HIV primarily infects vital cells in the human immune system such as helper T cells specifically CD4+ T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells through three main mechanisms: firstly, direct viral killing of infected cells; secondly, increased rates of apoptosis in infected cells; and thirdly, killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections.  If untreated, eventually most HIV-infected individuals develop AIDS AIDS Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome and die; however about one in ten remain healthy for many years, with no noticeable symptoms.cite journal

Origin and discovery
main AIDS origin
The AIDS epidemic was discovered June 5, 1981, when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a cluster of Pneumocystis pneumonia PCP caused by a form of Pneumocystis pneumonia PCP Pneumocystis carinii, now recognized as a distinct species Pneumocystis pneumonia PCP Pneumocystis jirovecii, in five homosexual men in Los Angeles.cite web

 The disease was originally dubbed GRID, or Gay-Related Immunodeficiency Immune Deficiency, but health authorities soon realized that nearly half of the people identified with the syndrome were not homosexual men. In 1982, the CDC introduced the term AIDS to describe the newly recognized syndrome, though it was still casually referred to as GRID. 

In 1983, scientists led by Luc Montagnier at the Pasteur Institute in France first discovered the virus that causes AIDS.cite journal

 The dual discovery led to considerable scientific disagreement, and it was not until Franois Mitterrand President Mitterrand of France and Ronald Reagan President Reagan of the USA met that the major issues were resolved. In 1986, both the French and the U.S. names for the virus itself were dropped in favour of the new term, human immunodeficiency virus HIV. 

HIV was classified as a member of the genus Lentivirus,cite web

 Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry of the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted to double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is present in the virus particle. This viral DNA is then integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase so that the genome can be Transcription genetics transcribed. Once the virus has infected the cell, two pathways are possible: either the virus becomes Incubation period latent and the infected cell continues to function, or the virus becomes active and replicates, and a large number of virus particles are liberated that can then infect other cells.

Two species of HIV infect humans: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is thought to have originated in southern Cameroon after jumping from wild chimpanzees Pan troglodytes troglodytes to humans during the twentieth century.cite journal

Although a variety of theories exist explaining the transfer of HIV to humans, no single hypothesis is unanimously accepted, and the topic remains controversial. The most widely accepted theory is so called 'Hunter' Theory according to which transference from chimp to human most likely occurred when a human was bitten by a chimp or was cut while butchering one, and the human became infected.

The Times published an article in 1987 stating that WHO suspected some kind of connection with its vaccine program and AIDS-epidemic. The story was almost entirely based on statements given by one unnamed WHO advisor. The theory was supported only by weak circumstantial evidence and is now disproven by unraveling the genetic code of the virus and finding out that the virus dates back to the 1930s.The Times, frontpage, 1987/5/11,

Freelance journalist Tom Curtis discussed one controversial possibility for the origin of HIV/AIDS in a 1992 Rolling Stone magazine article. He put forward what is now known as the OPV AIDS hypothesis, which suggests that AIDS was inadvertently caused in the late 1950s in the Belgian Congo by Hilary Koprowski's research into a polio vaccine.cite journal

 Although subsequently retracted due to libel issues surrounding its claims, the Rolling Stone article motivated another freelance journalist, Edward Hooper, to probe more deeply into this subject. Hooper's research resulted in his publishing a 1999 book, Edward Hooper The River, in which he alleged that an experimental oral polio vaccine prepared using chimpanzee kidney tissue was the route through which simian immunodeficiency virus SIV crossed into humans to become HIV, thus starting the human AIDS pandemic.cite book

Furthermore in February 2000 one of the original developers of the polio vaccine, Philadelphia based Wistar Institute found from its stores a vial of the original vaccine used in the vaccination program. It was analyzed in April 2001 and no traces of either HIV-1 or SIV were found in the sample.Blancou, P. et al. Polio vaccine samples not linked to AIDS Nature: 410, p. 1045-1046 2001 A second analysis showed that only macaque monkey kidney cells, which cannot be infected with SIV or HIV, were used to produce the vaccine.Blancou, P. et al. Polio vaccine samples not linked to AIDS Nature: 410, p. 1045-1046 2001 While the analysis was done on only one vial of vaccine, most scientists have concluded that the polio vaccine theory of the origins of HIV is not possible.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, three main transmission routes for HIV have been identified:
Sexual route. The majority of HIV infections are acquired through unprotected sexual relations. Sexual transmission can occur when infected sexual secretions of one partner come into contact with the genital, oral, or rectal mucous membranes of another.
Blood or blood product route. This transmission route can account for infections in intravenous drug users, hemophiliacs and recipients of blood transfusions though most transfusions are checked for HIV in the developed world and blood products. It is also of concern for persons receiving medical care in regions where there is prevalent substandard hygiene in the use of injection equipment, such as the reuse of needles in Third World countries. HIV can also be spread through the sharing of leeches. Health care workers such as nurses, laboratory workers, and doctors, have also been infected, although this occurs more rarely. People who give and receive tattoos, piercings, and scarification procedures can also be at risk of infection.
Mother-to-child transmission MTCT. The transmission of the virus from the mother to the child can occur in utero during the last weeks of pregnancy and at childbirth. In the absence of treatment, the transmission rate between the mother and child is 25%. However, where drug treatment and Cesarian section are available, this can be reduced to 1%. Breast feeding also presents a risk of infection for the baby.

HIV-2 is transmitted much less frequently by the MTCT and sexual route than HIV-1.

HIV has been found at low concentrations in the saliva, tears and urine of infected individuals, but there are no recorded cases of infection by these secretions and the potential risk of transmission is negligible. The use of physical barriers such as the latex condom is widely advocated to reduce the sexual transmission of HIV. Spermicide, when used alone or with vaginal contraceptives like a diaphragm contraceptive diaphragm, actually increases the male to female transmission rate due to inflammation of the vagina; it should not be considered a barrier to infection.cite web  url=http://www.fda.gov/oashi/aids/condom.html#should  title=Should spermicides be used with condoms?  accessdate=2006-10-23  work=Condom Brochure, FDA OSHI HIV STDs  Research is clarifying the relationship between male circumcision and HIV in differing social and cultural contexts, however critics point out that any correlation between circumcision and HIV is likely to come from cultural factors which govern not only whether someone is circumcised, but also their sexual practices and beliefs.

Some propose that since the gene pool is limited to this world and the sufferers are not removed by natural selection and allowed to infect others and even reproduce, a higher percentage of HIV will result, which in turn would result in an even higher percent.23

 The single-stranded RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7 and enzymes needed for the development of the virion such as reverse transcriptase, proteases, ribonuclease and integrase. A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring the integrity of the virion particle. This is, in turn, surrounded by the viral envelope which is composed of two layers of fatty molecules called phospholipids taken from the membrane of a human cell when a newly formed virus particle buds from the cell. Embedded in the viral envelope are proteins from the host cell and about 70 copies of a complex HIV protein that protrudes through the surface of the virus particle. This protein, known as Env, consists of a cap made of three molecules called gp120 glycoprotein gp 120, and a stem consisting of three gp41 molecules that anchor the structure into the viral envelope.

Of the nine genes that are encoded within the RNA genome, three of these genes, gag, pol, and env, contain information needed to make the structural proteins for new virus particles. env, for example, codes for a protein called gp160 that is broken down by a viral enzyme to form gp120 and gp41. The six remaining genes, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, and vpu or vpx in the case of HIV-2, are regulatory genes for proteins that control the ability of HIV to infect cells, produce new copies of virus replicate, or cause disease. The protein encoded by nef, for instance, appears necessary for the virus to replicate efficiently, and the vpu-encoded protein influences the release of new virus particles from infected cells. The ends of each strand of HIV RNA contain an RNA sequence called the long terminal repeat LTR. Regions in the LTR act as switches to control production of new viruses and can be triggered by proteins from either HIV or the host cell.

Tropism
The term viral tropism refers to which cell types HIV infects. HIV can infect a variety of immune cells such as Helper T cell CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and microglial cells. HIV-1 entry to macrophages and CD4+ T cells is mediated through interaction of the virion envelope glycoproteins gp120 with the CD4 molecule on the target cells and also with chemokine coreceptors.

Macrophage M-tropic strains of HIV-1, or non-syncitia-inducing strains NSI use the '-chemokine receptor CCR5 for entry and are thus able to replicate in macrophages and CD4+ T cells.

 This CCR5 coreceptor is used by almost all primary HIV-1 isolates regardless of viral genetic subtype. Indeed, macrophages play a key role in several critical aspects of HIV infection. They appear to be the first cells infected by HIV and perhaps the source of HIV production when CD4+ cells become depleted in the patient. Macrophages and microglial cells are the cells infected by HIV in the central nervous system. In tonsils and adenoids of HIV-infected patients, macrophages fuse into multinucleated giant cells that produce huge amounts of virus. 

T-tropic isolates, or syncitia-inducing SI strains replicate in primary CD4+ T cells as well as in macrophages and use the '-chemokine receptor, CXCR4, for entry.

 Dual-tropic HIV-1 strains are thought to be transitional strains of the HIV-1 virus and thus are able to use both CCR5 and LESTR as co-receptors for viral entry.

The '-chemokine, SDF-1, a ligand for CXCR4, suppresses replication of T-tropic HIV-1 isolates. It does this by down-regulating the expression of CXCR4 on the surface of these cells. HIV that use only the CCR5 receptor are termed R5, those that only use CXCR4 are termed X4, and those that use both, X4R5. However, the use of coreceptor alone does not explain viral tropism, as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection and HIV can also infect a subtype of myeloid dendritic cells,

 One example of how this occurs is people with the CCR5-32 mutation; these people are resistant to infection with R5 virus as the mutation stops HIV from binding to this coreceptor, reducing its ability to infect target cells. 

Sexual intercourse is the major mode of HIV transmission. Both X4 and R5 HIV are present in the seminal fluid which is passed from partner to partner. The virions can then infect numerous cellular targets and disseminate into the whole organism. However, a selection process leads to a predominant transmission of the R5 virus through this pathway.

Entry to the cell
HIV enters macrophages and CD4+ T cells by the adsorption of glycoproteins on its surface to receptors on the target cell followed by fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane and the release of the HIV capsid into the cell.cite journal  author=Chan D, Kim P  title=HIV entry and its inhibition  journal=Cell  volume=93  issue=5  pages=681-4  year=1998  pmid=9630213cite journal  author=Wyatt R, Sodroski J  title=The HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins: fusogens, antigens, and immunogens  journal=Science  volume=280  issue=5371  pages=1884-8  year=1998   doi=10.1126/science.280.5371.1884  pmid=9632381

The interactions of the trimeric envelope complex gp160 spike, discussed above and both CD4 and a chemokine receptor generally either CCR5 or CXCR4 but others are known to interact on the cell surface. The gp160 spike contains binding domains for both CD4 and chemokine receptors. The first step in fusion involves the high-affinity attachment of the CD4 binding domains of gp120 to CD4.  Once gp120 is bound with the CD4 protein, the envelope complex undergoes a structural change, exposing the chemokine binding domains of gp120 and allowing them to interact with the target chemokine receptor. This allows for a more stable two-pronged attachment, which allows the N-terminal fusion peptide gp41 to penetrate the cell membrane. Repeat sequences in gp41, HR1 and HR2 then interact, causing the collapse of the extracellular portion of gp41 into a hairpin. This loop structure brings the virus and cell membranes close together, allowing fusion of the membranes and subsequent entry of the viral capsid.

Once HIV has bound to the target cell, the HIV RNA and various enzymes, including reverse transcriptase, integrase, ribonuclease and protease, are injected into the cell.

HIV can infect dendritic cells DCs by this CD4-CCR5 route, but another route using mannose-specific C-type lectin receptors such as DC-SIGN can also be used.cite journal  author=Pope M, Haase A  title=Transmission, acute HIV-1 infection and the quest for strategies to prevent infection  journal=Nat Med  volume=9  issue=7  pages=847-52  year=2003  pmid=12835704 DCs are one of the first cells encountered by the virus during sexual transmission. They are currently thought to play an important role by transmitting HIV to T cells once the virus has been captured in the mucosa by DCs.

Replication and transcription
Once the viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse transcriptase liberates the single-stranded +RNA from the attached viral proteins and copies it into a complementary DNA of 9 kb size.

  author=Zheng, Y. H., Lovsin, N. and Peterlin, B. M.   title=Newly identified host factors modulate HIV replication   journal=Immunol. Lett.   year=2005   pages=225-234   volume=97   issue=2   id= PMID 15752562

 This process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone and it is during this step that mutations may occur. Such mutations may cause Resistance to antiviral drugs drug resistance. The reverse transcriptase then makes a complementary DNA strand to form a double-stranded viral DNA intermediate vDNA. This vDNA is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase. 

This integrated viral DNA may then lie dormant, in the latent stage of HIV infection. To actively produce the virus, certain cellular transcription factors need to be present, the most important of which is NF-kB NF-'B NF kappa B, which is upregulated when T cells become activated.

 This means that those cells most likely to be killed by HIV are in fact those currently fighting infection.

In this replication process, the integrated provirus is copied to mRNA which is then Splicing genetics spliced into smaller pieces. These small pieces produce the regulatory proteins Tat which encourages new virus production and Rev. As Rev accumulates it gradually starts to inhibit mRNA splicing.

 At this stage, the structural proteins Gag and Env are produced from the full-length mRNA. The full-length RNA is actually the virus genome; it binds to the Gag protein and is packaged into new virus particles.

HIV-1 and HIV-2 appear to package their RNA differently; HIV-1 will bind to any appropriate RNA whereas HIV-2 will preferentially bind to the mRNA which was used to create the Gag protein itself. This may mean that HIV-1 is better able to mutate HIV-1 infection progresses to AIDS faster than HIV-2 infection and is responsible for the majority of global infections.

Assembly and release
The final step of the viral cycle, assembly of new HIV-1 virons, begins at the plasma membrane of the host cell. The Env polyprotein gp160 goes through the endoplasmic reticulum and is transported to the Golgi complex where it is cleaved by protease and processed into the two HIV envelope glycoproteins gp41 and gp120. These are transported to the plasma membrane of the host cell where gp41 anchors the gp120 to the membrane of the infected cell. The Gag p55 and Gag-Pol p160 polyproteins also associate with the inner surface of the plasma membrane along with the HIV genomic RNA as the forming virion begins to bud from the host cell. Maturation either occurs in the forming bud or in the immature virion after it buds from the host cell. During maturation, HIV proteases cleave the polyproteins into individual functional HIV proteins and enzymes. The various structural components then assemble to produce a mature HIV virion.cite book

  Image:subtype.png thumb 200px Map showing HIV-1 subtype prevalence. The bigger the pie chart, the more infections are present.
 
HIV differs from many other viruses as it has very high genetic variability. This diversity is a result of its fast HIV#Life cycle of HIV replication cycle, with the generation of 109 to 1010 virions every day, coupled with a high mutation rate of approximately 3 x 10-5 per nucleotide base per cycle of replication and Genetic recombination recombinogenic properties of reverse transcriptase.

 This complex scenario leads to the generation of many variants of HIV in a single infected patient in the course of one day. This variability is compounded when a single cell is simultaneously infected by two or more different strains of HIV. When simultaneous infection occurs, the genome of progeny virions may be composed of RNA strands from two different strains. This hybrid virion then infects a new cell where it undergoes replication. As this happens, the reverse transcriptase, by jumping back and forth between the two different RNA templates, will generate a newly synthesized retroviral DNA sequence that is a recombinant between the two parental genomes. This recombination is most obvious when it occurs between subtypes. 

The closely related simian immunodeficiency virus SIV exhibits a somewhat different behavior: in its natural hosts, African green monkeys and sooty mangabeys, the retrovirus is present in high levels in the blood, but evokes only a mild immune response,Holzammer, S., Holznagel, E., Kaul, A., Kurth, R. and Norley, S. 2001 High virus loads in naturally and experimentally SIVagm-infected African green monkeys.

Infection with HIV-1 is associated with a progressive decrease of the CD4+ T cell count and an increase in viral load. The stage of infection can be determined by measuring the patient's CD4+ T cell count, and the level of HIV in the blood.

The initial infection with HIV generally occurs after transfer of body fluids from an infected person to an uninfected one. The first stage of infection, the primary, or acute infection, is a period of rapid viral replication that immediately follows the individual's exposure to HIV leading to an abundance of virus in the peripheral blood with levels of HIV commonly approaching several million viruses per&nbsp;mL. cite journal   author=Piatak, M., Jr, Saag, M.

This acute viremia is associated in virtually all patients with the activation of cytotoxic T cell CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts rebound to around 800 cells per&nbsp;mL  the normal value is 1200 cells per&nbsp;mL . A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.

 During this period usually 2-4 weeks post-exposure most individuals 80 to 90% develop an influenza or mononucleosis-like illness called acute HIV infection, the most common symptoms of which may include fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, rash, myalgia, malaise, mouth and esophagal sores, and may also include, but less commonly, headache, nausea and vomiting, enlarged liver/spleen, weight loss, thrush, and neurological symptoms.

 Because of the nonspecific nature of these illnesses, it is often not recognized as a sign of HIV infection. Even if patients go to their doctors or a hospital, they will often be misdiagnosed as having one of the more common infectious diseases with the same symptoms. Consequently, these primary symptoms are not used to diagnose HIV infection as they do not develop in all cases and because many are caused by other more common diseases. However, recognizing the syndrome can be important because the patient is much more infectious during this period.

A strong immune defense reduces the number of viral particles in the blood stream, marking the start of the infection's incubation period clinical latency stage. Clinical latency can vary between two weeks and 20 years. During this early phase of infection, HIV is active within Lymphatic system lymphoid organs, where large amounts of virus become trapped in the follicular dendritic cells FDC network.

 The surrounding tissues that are rich in CD4+ T cells may also become infected, and viral particles accumulate both in infected cells and as free virus. Individuals who are in this phase are still infectious. During this time, Helper T cell CD4+ CD45RO+ T cells carry most of the proviral load.

When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and infections with a variety of opportunistic microbes appear. The first symptoms often include moderate and unexplained weight loss, recurring respiratory tract infections such as sinusitis, bronchitis, otitis media, pharyngitis, prostatitis, skin rashes, and oral ulcerations. Common opportunistic infections and tumors, most of which are normally controlled by robust CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity then start to affect the patient. Typically, resistance is lost early on to oral Candida species and to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which leads to an increased susceptibilty to oral candidiasis thrush and tuberculosis. Later, reactivation of latent Herpesviridae herpes viruses may cause worsening recurrences of herpes simplex eruptions, shingles, Epstein-Barr virus-induced B-cell lymphomas, or Kaposi's sarcoma, a tumor of endothelial cells that occurs when HIV proteins such as Tat interact with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Human Herpesvirus-8. Pneumonia caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii is common and often fatal. In the final stages of AIDS, infection with cytomegalovirus another herpes virus or Mycobacterium avium complex is more prominent. Not all patients with AIDS get all these infections or tumors, and there are other tumors and infections that are less prominent but still significant.

 For example, less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa have been tested and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities are counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.

HIV-1 testing consists of initial screening with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive result from the initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in duplicate.

 If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test e.g., Western blot or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay IFA. Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by Western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate Western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person, or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.

 Although IFA can be used to confirm infection in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used. Generally, a second specimen should be collected more than a month later and retested for persons with indeterminate Western blot results. Although much less commonly available, nucleic acid testing e.g., viral RNA or proviral DNA amplification method can also help diagnosis in certain situations. In addition, a few tested specimens might provide inconclusive results because of a low quantity specimen. In these situations, a second specimen is collected and tested for HIV infection.

There is currently no HIV vaccine vaccine or cure for HIV or AIDS. The only known method of prevention is avoiding exposure to the virus. However, an antiretroviral treatment, known as post-exposure prophylaxis is believed to reduce the risk of infection if begun directly after exposure.cite book

 Current HAART options are combinations or cocktails consisting of at least three drugs belonging to at least two types, or classes, of anti-retroviral agents. Typically, these classes are two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors NARTIs or NRTIs plus either a protease inhibitor pharmacology protease inhibitor or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor NNRTI. Because AIDS progression in children is more rapid and less predictable than in adults, particularly in young infants, more aggressive treatment is recommended for children than adults.

HAART allows the stabilisation of the patients symptoms and viremia, but it neither cures the patient, nor alleviates the symptoms, and high levels of HIV-1, often HAART resistant, return once treatment is stopped.

 However, HAART sometimes achieves far less than optimal results, in some circumstances being effective in less than fifty percent of patients. This is due to a variety of reasons such as medication intolerance/side effects, prior ineffective antiretroviral therapy and infection with a drug-resistant strain of HIV. However, non-adherence and non-persistence with antiretroviral therapy is the major reason most individuals fail to benefit from HAART.

 The reasons for non-adherence and non-persistence with HAART are varied and overlapping. Major psychosocial issues, such as poor access to medical care, inadequate social supports, psychiatric disease and drug abuse contribute to non-adherence. The complexity of these HAART regimens, whether due to pill number, dosing frequency, meal restrictions or other issues along with side effects that create intentional non-adherence also contribute to this problem.

The timing for starting HIV treatment is still debated.  There is no question that treatment should be started before the patient's CD4 count falls below 200, and most national guidelines say to start treatment once the CD4 count falls below 350; but there is some evidence from cohort studies that treatment should be started before the CD4 count falls below 350.

 Research to improve current treatments includes decreasing side effects of current drugs, further simplifying drug regimens to improve adherence, and determining the best sequence of regimens to manage drug resistance. Unfortunately, only a vaccine is thought to be able to halt the pandemic. This is because a vaccine would cost less, thus being affordable for developing countries, and would not require daily treatment. However, after over 20 years of research, HIV-1 remains a difficult target for a vaccine.In February 2007, The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases published a report that gave details of a potential region on HIV's surface that is a potential target for a vaccine.

 This is the first comprehensive evaluation of the World Bank's HIV/AIDS support to countries, from the beginning of the epidemic through mid-2004. Because the Bank aims to assist in implementation of national government programmes, their experience provides important insights on how national AIDS programmes can be made more effective.

The development of HAART as effective therapy for HIV infection and AIDS has substantially reduced the death rate from this disease in those areas where these drugs are widely available. This has created the misperception that the disease has vanished. In fact, as the life expectancy of persons with AIDS has increased in countries where HAART is widely used, the number of persons living with AIDS has increased substantially. In the United States, the number of persons with AIDS increased from about 35,000 in 1988 to over 220,000 in 1996.
