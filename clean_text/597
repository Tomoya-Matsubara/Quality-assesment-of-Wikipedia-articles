Early in her career she sewed sequins for Anthony Powell while also working as an assistant to Sophie Devine (costume designer for classic English films). Myers then turned to theatre and low-budget films such as the 1967 comedy Smashing Time. Upon being persuaded by Gene Wilder, Myers moved to the US and worked with him on the films The World's Greatest Lover, The Woman in Red, and Haunted Honeymoon.1

The actor, who portrayed singer Bobby Darin, had to wear a wide range of costumes as a reflection of his life's journey, from bright suits to his signature red sweater.4
