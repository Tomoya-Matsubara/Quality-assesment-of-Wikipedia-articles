Upon reporting to the commander of the American Expeditionary Forces, he was assigned to command a brigade of the 32nd Division and assumed command of the 4th Brigade of Marines of the 2d Division immediately following the attack of the division in the Battle of Soissons. On 28 July 1918, Major General Lejeune assumed command of the 2nd Division and remained in that capacity until August 1919, when the unit was demobilized.

Marine Corps Birthday message
In the Marine Corps' annual celebration of the establishment of the Marine Corps on November 10, 1775 at Tun Tavern, the following message from MajGen John A. Lejeune is read:1213
MARINE CORPS ORDERS
No. 47 (Series 1921)
HEADQUARTERS U.S. MARINE CORPS
Washington, November 1, 1921

759. The following will be read to the command on the 10th of November, 1921, and hereafter on the   
10 November of every year. Should the order not be received by the 10th of November, 1921, it 
will be read upon receipt.

   (1) On November 10, 1775, a Corps of Marines was created by  a resolution of Continental 
Congress. Since that date many thousand men have borne the name &quot;Marine&quot;. In memory of them it is 
fitting that we who are Marines should commemorate the birthday of our corps by calling to mind the 
glories of its long and illustrious history.

   (2) The record of our corps is one which will bear comparison with that of the most famous 
military organizations in the world's history. During 90 of the 146 years of its existence the 
Marine Corps has been in action against the Nation's foes. From the Battle of Trenton to the 
Argonne, Marines have won foremost honors in war, and in the long eras of tranquility at home, 
generation after generation of Marines have grown gray in war in both hemispheres and in every 
corner of the seven seas, that our country and its citizens might enjoy peace and security.

   (3) In every battle and skirmish since the birth of our corps, Marines have acquitted themselves 
with the greatest distinction, winning new honors on each occasion until the term &quot;Marine&quot; has come 
to signify all that is highest in military efficiency and soldierly virtue.

   (4) This high name of distinction and soldierly repute we who are Marines today have received 
from those who preceded us in the corps. With it we have also received from them the eternal spirit 
which has animated our corps from generation to generation and has been the distinguishing mark of 
the Marines in every age. So long as that spirit continues to flourish Marines will be found equal 
to every emergency in the future as they have been in the past, and the men of our Nation will 
regard us as worthy successors to the long line of illustrious men who have served as &quot;Soldiers of 
the Sea&quot; since the founding of the Corps.

JOHN A. LEJEUNE,
Major General Commandant
