is a 1960 Japanese horror film, directed by Nobuo Nakagawa and starring Utako Mitsuya. Jigoku was re-made in 1970 by Tatsumi Kumashiro, and later re-made again under the title of Japanese Hell by Teruo Ishii in 1999.
Jigoku is notable for separating itself from other Japanese Horror films of the era such as Kwaidan or Onibaba due to its graphic imagery of torment in Hell.
