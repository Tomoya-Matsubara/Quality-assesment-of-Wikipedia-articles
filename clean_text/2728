Plot

The plot of Eyeshield 21 revolves around a weak, unassertive boy named Sena Kobayakawa who enters the high school of his choiceDeimon Private Senior High School. Sena's only remarkable physical abilities are his running speed and agility, which are noted by the school's American football team captain Yoichi Hiruma. Hiruma forces Sena to join the Deimon Devil Bats as its running back. To protect his identity from other teams who want to recruit him, Sena is forced to publicly assume the role of team secretary and enter the field under the pseudonym of &quot;Eyeshield 21&quot;, wearing a helmet with an eyeshield to hide his features. The makeshift team initially takes part in the spring football tournament hoping to win through the strength of their new &quot;secret weapon&quot;. However, the extremely weak team is eliminated early by the Ojo White Knights, one of best football teams in Japan.
After Deimon's defeat, the spring tournament is revealed as secondary in importance to the fall tournament, where the teams compete for the chance to play in the Christmas Bowlthe high school football league championship. Hiruma, Ryokan Kurita, and Sena regroup and slowly build a real team from misfits and students looking to define themselves, such as Tar&lt;U+014D&gt; &quot;Monta&quot; Raimona baseball player who can only catchand the Ha-Ha Brothers. Other characters slowly join the team, and the series follows the building and growth of the Deimon Devil Bats and its members, and rival teams as they all strive to achieve their goal of playing in the Christmas Bowl.
Following the Christmas Bowl, Japan begins to gather the best football players to form a team to represent it at the American Football Youth World Championship, where a Most Valuable Player (MVP) will be rewarded an NFL contract and $3 million. Team Japan reaches the final against Team America, in which the game ends as a tie, and both teams are declared winners. Both teams are unsatisfied with this and return to the field for their own, improvised &quot;overtime&quot;, causing chaos with officials. It is unclear which team wins the unofficial extra period, but Panther of Team America holds the MVP trophy aloft, winning the professional contract with the San Antonio Armadillos. The series concludes with Sena becoming the captain of the Devil Bats after Hiruma and Kurita leave school to attend college. In his final year of high school, Clifford invites Sena to Notre Dame High School. In the final chapter, the main characters are in college or playing amateur-league football while employed.
Production
Before the series was published regularly in the publication Weekly Sh&lt;U+014D&gt;nen Jump, Inagaki and Murata published two one-shots called  and  for the 14th and 15th issues of the magazine.1 Despite having never played American football, Inagaki chose this theme after deciding that he wanted to create &quot;a protagonist that was wimpy at the beginning, yet could perform outstandingly in a sports game&quot;, and with this premise in mind he decided that American football would be &quot;a very suitable material.&quot;2 When originally creating Eyeshield 21 Inagaki said he was wary because he did not want his manga becoming &quot;a simulator of football&quot;.3 Inagaki said that Eyeshield 21 is set in Tokyo, &quot;but perhaps not in the center of the city&lt;U+2014&gt;more in the suburbs.&quot; He added that this is &quot;not very significant&quot; and that aspects of the two creators' hometowns are reflected in the setting.4
During Eyeshield 21's original run in the Weekly Sh&lt;U+014D&gt;nen Jump, Inagaki went several times to the United States to see college football matches5 and visit a space center to collect reference materials to use as a basis for creating the Nasa Aliens.6 He also visited a military base as he needed to draw one when Hiruma's background is revealed,7 and watched an NFL game where he noted that the &quot;players transmitted an intimidating and powerful feeling&quot;, saying that they &quot;were facing dinosaurs&quot;. With this in mind he created Rikiya Gao, an American player of monstrous size.8
Before being asked to work on Eyeshield 21, Yusuke Murata had read some of Inagaki's manga and noted that they &quot;had many cool design concepts of uniforms and equipment&quot;. He said, &quot;it could be turned into a great manga story&quot; and he would &quot;be happy to take the challenge&quot;; eventually he was chosen.9 While illustrating chapters, Murata made many mistakes, and his pollen allergy hurt him because whenever he made a mistake he inhaled dust from his eraser.1011 To draw the characters' sketches, he used a mechanical pencil that he considered special because it was given to him by Masanori Morita.12

Critics have generally given the Eyeshield 21 manga positive reviews. Carlo Santos from Anime News Network rated it B+ overall and called it a &quot;typical sports story&quot;, and wrote that &quot;[w]hat really pushes this series above average are its well-defined cast of characters and strong artwork&quot;. He also wrote that &quot;anyone who's ever found actual American football boring ... may change their minds after seeing the action sequences in Eyeshield 21.&quot;87 In a review of Volume 37, Santos said, &quot;[a] lot of familiar clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;s show themselves ... &quot; in Eyeshield 21, and that &quot;[t]he storyline also does a sloppy job of keeping track of the game ... making it even less believable than it already is&quot;.88 Deb Aoki from About.com wrote that tying with Bleach, Eyeshield 21 was the Best Continuing Sh&lt;U+014D&gt;nen Manga of 2007, and that it &quot;has well-written characters, dynamic artwork, nail-biting cliffhangers, plus a winning mix of comedy, action and drama that make it a series that's worth picking up and sticking with&quot;.89
Jarred Pine from Mania Entertainment praised the humor, which &quot;ranges from outrageous slapstick to more subtle background gags, all of it very funny&quot;.90 He also wrote that the creators can &quot;bring out the energy and excitement of the game for the readers&quot;.91 June Shimonishi reviewing Volume 16 for School Library Journal, wrote that it &quot;delivers a fresh and entertaining take on all the standard sports clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;s&quot;.

Bertschy rated the story and artwork in the third graphic novel A.93
Anime reception
The anime adaptation was featured several times in Japanese television rankings,9495 with the first episode having a 7.5 percent television viewership rating.96 In 2006, Japanese television network TV Asahi conducted a poll for the top hundred anime, and Eyeshield 21 was placed 47th.97 Daniel Marks, Senior Vice President, Strategy &amp; Business Development of Viz Media, said that the Eyeshield 21 series is &quot;an action-packed drama with a positive message, teaching the importance of teamwork, overcoming obstacles and having goals&quot;.98
The anime adaptation of Eyeshield 21 received positive and mixed responses. In her review of the first DVD of the series, Erin Finnegan from Anime News Network stated, &quot;[t]he pace of Eyeshield 21 is its saving grace. It's way less boring than all the time outs and commercial breaks in a regular NFL game. Football is hard to understand, but Eyeshield 21 explains the Byzantine rules ... in an entertaining way. We're never left waiting for the ref's decision for long minutes like in real life. A lot of dramatic tension carries the action between plays.&quot;99 In her review of the second DVD of the series, Finnegan criticized the artwork, saying, &quot;any episode [of the show] without a game is clearly farmed out to an inferior animation studio&quot;.100 Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment gave the third DVD collection a rating of C- and wrote that Eyeshield 21 &quot;has a good solid story idea, showing a young man finding his way through sports by finding friends and realizing he has potential, but it's so sidelined so often that it's frustrating to see it deal with situations as it does.&quot;101
