B-435 ' Zaporizhzhia is a Foxtrot class submarine project 641 Foxtrot class submarine, the only submarine of the Ukrainian Navy at the moment. 

Despite being on a years-lasting repair, Zaporizhzhia is on active military service. She is run by a naval crew of 78, commanded by Captain 1st Rank Capt. Oleh Orlov.

History
Zaporizhzhia's keel was laid down in 1970 at the New Admiralty Shipyard in Saint Petersburg Leningrad. In 1970 she was ship commissioning commissioned into the Soviet Red Banner Northern Fleet, where she conducted 14 patrols, including a port call in Cuba. Later the submarine was transferred to the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, serving there until 1994. In 1995, the submarine's batteries permanently failed and she became abandoned without their replacement. 

In 1997 the submarine was handed over to the Ukrainian Navy during the partition of the Black Sea Fleet. Like most of the country's naval ships, she was renamed after one of Ukraine's cities &mdash; Zaporizhzhia. The city's community began to co-sponsor the ship, especially the accommodational needs of the crew. But it was only in 2003 when Ukrainian government became able to buy a new batteries set abroad and make Zaporizhzhia's survival real. However, she was immediately placed under repair in Sevastopol. The repair is finished on 75% at the moment, but the submarine is still unable to put out to the sea.

In 2005, Zaporizhzhia was considered to take part in the 2006 joint exercise conducted by the Ukrainian Navy and the Marina Militare Italian Navy, but the end of her repair was postponed.  In January 2007, Defense Minister Anatoly Hrytsenko stated that Ukraine intends to sell Zaporozhie.cite web  url=http://en.for-ua.com/news/2007/01/25/162942.html  title=Ukraine wants to get rid of its submarine  accessdate=2007-01-26  work=forUm
