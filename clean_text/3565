&lt;U+2018&gt;Al&lt;U+012B&gt; ibn Ab&lt;U+012B&gt; T&lt;U+0101&gt;lib ()&lt;U+200E&gt; (Thirteenth of Rajab, 24 BH &lt;U+2013&gt; Twenty-first of Ramadan, 40 AH) (Approximately: march 17, 599 AD - January 28, 661 AD) 1 was an early Islamic leader, the first Shi&lt;U+2019&gt;ah Imam, and the fourth Sunni Caliph. He is revered by Sunni Muslims as the last of the four Rightly Guided Caliphs and as a foremost religious authority on the Qur'an and Islamic jurisprudence. Shi'a Muslims consider him the First Imam appointed by the Islamic Prophet Muhammad and the first rightful caliph. Ali was the cousin of Muhammad, and after his marriage to Fatima Zahra, he also became Muhammad's son-in-law.
Biography

Birth

On the thirteenth of the month of Rajab, twenty-three years before the Hijra of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, a child was born in the family of Abu Talib ibn &lt;U+2018&gt;Abd al-Muttalib, the light of whom kindled the whole World.
Kunaab Mecci narrates about Ali&lt;U+2019&gt;s birth: &quot;We and `Abbas ibn `Abd al-Muttalib were sitting together when suddenly we saw Fatima binte Asad moving towards the Kaaba in the condition having delivery pain and saying, &lt;U+201C&gt;Oh Allah, I have faith in you and the Prophet (i.e., Ibr&lt;U+0101&gt;h&lt;U+012B&gt;m) who by your command laid the foundation of this house. O Allah! I swear you by the same Prophet Muhammad and swear you by the child in my womb make this birth comfortable and easy for me.&lt;U+201D&gt; This was the time when all of us saw with our own eyes that the wall of Kaaba broke apart and Fatima binte Asad entered into the Kaaba. Then the wall again united.
We ran terrified and trembling to our houses to send our women into the Kaaba for the help and assistance of Fatima binte Asad. We did our best but the door did not open. This event surprised all the people of Mecca. The women of Mecca were anxiously counting moments to meet Fatima binte Asad till the time she came out of the Kaaba along with a beautiful baby, saying, &lt;U+201C&gt;Allah has chosen me from among the ladies of Mecca and He made me His guest in His house and gave me meals and fruits of the heaven to eat.&lt;U+201D&gt; 2
The ladies who were surrounding her in the form of a circle and escorting her to her home asked her, ''&lt;U+201C&gt;What name have you given to this child?&lt;U+201D&gt;&quot;
Fatima binte Asad said: &lt;U+201C&gt;When I was in the Kaaba, I heard a hidden voice call,&lt;U+201D&gt; Name this child &lt;U+201C&gt;Ali&lt;U+201D&gt;. According to a well-known traditional saying, Ali ibn Abi Talib was born 12 or 13 years before the Islamic Prophet Muhammad began to preach CE.12
Early life
Ali's father, Abu Talib ibn &lt;U+2018&gt;Abd al-Muttalib, was a Sheikh of Banu Hashim, an important branch of the powerful tribe of the Quraish, and an uncle to the young Muhammad. When Muhammad was orphaned and then lost his grandfather (Abdul Muttalib), Abu Talib ibn &lt;U+2018&gt;Abd al-Muttalib took Muhammad into his house. Later Muhammad set out and married Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, Ali was born 3 years later. 5 When Ali was six years old, as a result of famine in and around Mecca, Muhammad requested to become his guardian.3
When Muhammad reported that he had received a divine revelation, Ali, then only about ten years old, believed him and professed Islam.4 He was one of the first males to enter Islam. Ali stood firmly in support of Muhammad during the years of persecution of Muslims in Mecca. In 622 CE, the year of Muhammad's migration to Yathrib, Ali risked his life by sleeping in Muhammad's bed to impersonate him and thwart an assassination plot, so that Muhammad could flee in safety. Ali was one of the Greatest Warriors and still is. This night is called &quot;Laylat almabit&quot;. Some of narrations say the 207th Ayat from Baqarah5 is about this issue.6 According to Shi'a scholar Tabatabaei, &quot;Shi'ah and Sunni chains that this verse was revealed about Ali concerning his sacrifice on the night of Hijra.&quot;7
Ali survived the plot, but risked his life again by staying in Mecca to carry out Muhammad's instructions: to restore to their owners all the goods and properties that had been entrusted to Muhammad for safekeeping.8
Ali ibn Abi Talib and Holy Wars


Zulfiqar, a fictional representation of the sword of Ali.

Islam is the religion of peace and tranquility and does not like killing, plundering, and bloodshed. But if someone kills another without any reason then Islam has strong punishment to deal with him. Of course, if an enemy attacks the Muslims then by the standards of wits, common sense, and religious law, self defense which as a form of Jihad becomes essential and indispensable.
All the battles of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad in which Ali ibn Abi Talib fought armed and truthfully were defensive battles. Ali ibn Abi Talib was such a brave, faithful, holy warrior who never got frustrated and upset and tired of the fighting and battles. He was afraid of no one except Allah. He used to say, &lt;U+201C&gt;By Allah, if I see that on one side is the truth and on the other side all the rest of the people I, without caring and paying heed to those reproaching me, will fight all alone with my sword, on the way and path of the right, against them.&lt;U+201D&gt;
Ali in Medina

Calligraphy of Ali at Hagia Sophia, Istanbul, Turkey

The small community of Muslim immigrants in Medina, the Muhajirun, were at first extremely poor. They had no land, no houses, and lived on the charity of the Madinans who had converted to Islam. Ali shared in all the labor and hardships of the community.
For the ten years that Muhammad led the community in Medina, Ali was extremely active in his service, serving in his armies, leading parties of warriors on raids, and carrying messages and orders. With the exception of Tabuk, Ali took part in all the battles and expeditions fought for Islam. As one of Muhammad&lt;U+2019&gt;s lieutenants, and later his son-in-law, Ali was a person of authority and standing in the Muslim community. 11
Ali first distinguished himself as a warrior in 624 CE, at the Battle of Badr. He defeated the Banu Umayyed champion Walid ibn Utba as well as many other Meccan soldiers. Al Seerah of Ibn Hisham narrates how he killed 20 of the pagans9 and Al Maghazi put the number at 22.10
Ali was also prominent at the Battle of Uhud, as well as many other battles where he wielded a bifurcated sword known as Zulfiqar.11 At the beginning Ali killed Talhah Ibn Abu Talhah and then his brother Abu Saad ibn Abu Talhah, the bearers of the banner of the pagans.12 Ibn Al-Atheer , Abu Rafi, and Tabari reported that Ali, alone, destroyed all the standard bearers.13, The death of the bearers of the banner heightened the morale of the Muslims and shook the hearts of the pagans and when the army of Islam was defeated and most of the Muslims had fled Ali was one of the few Muslims who defended Muhammad. According to Ibn Atheer, &quot;The Prophet became the object of the attack of various units of the army of Quraish from all sides. Ali attacked, in compliance with the Prophet's orders, every unit that made an attack upon him (the Prophet) and dispersed them or killed some of them, and this thing took place a number of times in Uhud&quot;14 and it was said &quot;La fata illa Ali, La saifa illa Zulfiqar&quot; (There is no brave man except Ali and there is no sword which renders service except Zulfiqar).&quot;15
Ghadir Khumm

On March 10, 632 CE (eighteenth of Dhu'l-Hijjah, 10 AH) the caravan of Muhammad returned to Medina with him from the hajj, and ordered the other caravans to stop at a pond known as Khumm. On giving a speech to the Muslims there, Muhammad said:

&quot;Allahomma man kont mawlah fa hath Ali mawlah (For whoever I am a Mawla of, then Ali is his Mawla), Allahoma wali man walah wa aadi man aadah, wansor man nasarah, wakhthol man khathalah (Allah be with him and with those who follow him and against his opposers for ever) wa adir al hak maaho kaifama dar (May rightness be with him were ever he goes).

There is another quote from the Islamic Prophet Muhammad about the rightness of Ali ibn Abi Talib to succeed him which is:

&quot;O people, I am a human being. I am about to receive a message from my Lord and I, in response to Allah's call, (would bid good-bye to you), but I am leaving among you two weighty things: the one being the Book of Allah in which there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah and adhere to it. He exhorted (us) (to hold fast) to the Book of Allah and then said: The second are the members of my household I remind you (of your duties) to the members of my family.16.&quot;

This quote is confirmed by both Shi&lt;U+2019&gt;a and Sunni everywhere, but Sunnis and Shi&lt;U+2019&gt;ahs take different meanings of the quote.
The death of Muhammad
In 632 CE, Muhammad had been ailing for some time but seemed to have recovered. He left his house to take part in prayers at the mosque, then returned to his quarters and died.
While Ali and the rest of Muhammad's close family were washing his body for burial, at a gathering attended by a small group of Muslims at Saqifah, the succession was given to Abu Bakr by vote. According to Sunni accounts, Muhammad died without having appointed a successor, and with a need for leadership, they gathered and voted for the position of caliph. Shi'a accounts differ by asserting that Muhammad had designated Ali as his successor on a number of occasions, including on his death bed. Ali had many friends, followers and supporters who believed that he should have succeeded Muhammad. This did not create an immediate division, however, because Ali did not fight against the elected caliphs.17
The succession to Muhammad is an extremely contentious issue. Muslims ultimately divided into two branches based on their political attitude towards this issue, which forms the primary theological barrier between the two major divisions of Muslims: Sunni and Shi'a, with the latter following Ali as the successor to Muhammad. The two groups also disagree on Ali's attitude towards Abu Bakr, and the two caliphs who succeeded him: Umar ibn al-Khattab and Uthman ibn Affan. Sunnis tend to stress Ali's acceptance and support of their rule, while the Shi'a claims that he distanced himself from them. They argue that he did not do so because he was angry at having been denied worldly power and pleasure; rather, he felt that he had a duty to keep the Muslim community on the strict path of Islam, and that he was being kept from fulfilling the religious duty that Muhammad had appointed to him. The Sunni Muslims say that if Ali was the rightful successor as ordained by God Himself, then it would have been his duty as the leader of the Muslim nation to make war with these people (Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman) until Ali established the decree. But Ali did not fight Abu Bakr, Umar or Uthman, because firstly he did not have the military strength and if he decided to, it would have caused a civil war amongst the Muslims, which was still a nascent community throughout the Arab world.18
Ali has also written to Egyptians during his caliphate:

&quot;When the Holy Prophet passed away; the Muslims started a tug-of-war for the caliphate. I swear by Allah that at that juncture it could not even be imagined that the Arabs would snatch the seat of the caliphate from the family and descendants of the Holy Prophet and that they would be swearing the oath of allegiance for the caliphate to a different person. At every stage I kept myself aloof from that struggle of supremacy and power-politics till I found the heretics had openly taken to heresy and schism and were trying to undermine and ruin the religion preached by our Holy Prophet. I felt afraid that, even after seeing and recognizing the evil, if I did not stand up to help Islam and the Muslims it would be a worse calamity to me than my losing authority and power over you, which was only a transient and short-lived affair. Therefore, when I stood up amidst the sweeping surge of innovations and schism the dark clouds of heresy dispersed, falsehood and schism were crushed and the religion was saved. Nahj al Balagha, Letter 62&quot;

Inheritance
Shi'ah Muslims believe that Ali and Fatima, as well as the wives of Muhammad had an additional cause for disaffection with Abu Bakr.19 The new caliph argued that Muhammad's considerable landed property had been held by Muhammad in trust for the community, and was rightfully the property of the state, despite Ali's rejoinder that Muhammad's revelations included accounts of prophetic inheritance (Qur'an 27:16, 21:89). According to Shi'ah Muslims, Abu Bakr gave state pensions to Muhammad's widows, but Muhammad's blood relatives, Ali, Fatima and `Abd Allah ibn `Abbas, did not receive even that much.
After Fatima's death Ali again claimed her inheritance, but was denied with the same argument. However, Umar, the caliph who succeeded Abu Bakr, did restore the estates in Medina to al-Abbas and Ali, as representatives of Muhammad's clan, the Banu Hashim. The properties in Khaybar and Fadak were retained as state property (Madelung 1997 p. 62). Shi'a sources regard this as another instance of the persecution of Muhammad's lineage, the Ahl al-Bayt, at the hands of the caliphs they regard as usurpers.20
Caliphate
Soon thereafter, Ali dismissed several provincial governors, some of whom were relatives of Uthman, and replaced them with trusted aides such as Malik al-Ashtar and Salman the Persian. Ali then transferred his capital from Medina to Kufa, the Muslim garrison city in what is now Iraq. The capital of the province of Syria, Damascus, was held by Mu'awiyah, the governor of Syria and a kinsman of Uthman, Ali's slain predecessor.21
Death

The place where, according to tradition, Ali was killed

It was nineteenth of Ramadan, while Ali was leading the morning prayers and was in the second Sujud of the second Raka'ah that Abdur Rahman ibn Muljim's sword fell and the life of the greatest warrior saint was taken away to his merciful Lord. The famous Christian writer of Lebanon George Jurdaq writes in his books on Ali, &lt;U+201C&gt;that with this one blow of the sword of Ibn Muljim the world was deprived of the person who, if had lived a few more years would have given the world a system of administration that future generations would have benefited for a long time to come.&lt;U+201D&gt; In fact the letter to his Governor of Egypt, Malik al-Ashtar, advising him of the &quot;Do's and Don'ts for a successful administration of the State is the hall mark in the annals of history&quot;. We can only say that Ali's supreme wisdom provides the guidance of a stature that mankind can aspire to.
Ali injured with the wound from the poisonous sword lived for two days. In these two days he dictated his Will and last testament to his son, Hassan ibn Ali. He advised his eldest son to love Allah and obey Him and to live for the service of the people in the way of Allah. &quot;And then do not forget to set apart the best of your time for communion with Allah, although every moment of yours is for Him, provided it is spent sincerely in the service of your people.&quot;
Ali's sermons, collected by Sayid Razi in the fourth century (AH) are the examples of the most brilliant piece of Arabic literature that after the Holy Qur'an and the authentic Hadith of the Prophet of Islam, ever produced.
What Syed Razi could compile in Nahj al-Balagha does not contain all the Sermons, letters and sayings of Ali. Masoodi in his famous book of history Muruj-al-Zahab says, that the only Sermons of Ali which have been preserved by various people, number more than 480. These were extempore orations, people have copied them from one another and compiled them in the book forms they have cited them and quoted passages from them in their books. The famous companion and pupil of Ali, Hassan al-Basri had made such arrangements that one of his own friends would memories the sermons delivered in the mosque of Kufa and relate the same in the next Friday&lt;U+2019&gt;s prayer in Basra. This shows the deep interest people of his own time had in these sermons and sayings.
Apparently out of these 480 sermons some were lost and Syed Razi could lay hands on only 245 sermons. Besides them he has collected about 75 letters and 489 sayings. Almost every one of the sermons, sayings and letters collected in Nahj al-Balagha is to be found books of authors who died long before Syed Raza was even born.
Ali died on the 21st of Ramadan (three days after receiving the head wound) in the city of Kufa (Iraq) in 661 CE. 15
Burial

Rawze-e-Sharif, the Blue Mosque, in Mazari Sharif, Afghanistan - Where a minority of Shi&lt;U+2019&gt;ahs believe Ali ibn Abi Talib is buried

Many Shi'a believe that Ali didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t want his grave to be desecrated by his enemies and because of that he asked his friends and family members to bury him secretly.. This secret gravesite is supposed to have been revealed in later times. Most Shi'as accept that Ali was buried at what is now the city of Najaf, which grew around the mosque and shrine called Masjid Ali.22

One story recounts that the caliph Harun al-Rashid (ruled from 786 to 809) went hunting and came upon a bit of raised ground which his dogs refused to approach. Local inhabitants told him that this was the grave of Ali ibn Abi Talib. The caliph ordered the building of a mausoleum, which was the nucleus of the city and the shrine.


Another story claims that the location of the gravesite was passed from father to son along the line of Shi'a Imams, and that Ja'far al-Sadiq, the sixth Shi'a Imam, told the caliph where to find the grave.


While an additional story, usually maintained by Afghans, notes that his body was taken and buried in the Afghan city of Mazari Sharif at the famous Blue Mosque or Rawze-e-Sharif. 16

Descendants


Two of his most famous sons, born to Fatima, were Hassan and Hussain. Hassan is said to have refrained from publicly claiming the caliphate, so as to prevent further bloodshed among Muslims. Muawiyah thus became caliph and established the Umayyad dynasty of caliphs. Hassan is, however, revered by most Shi'a as the second imam; his brother Hussain is reckoned as the third, except by the Ismaili, who consider him the second imam.
Ali's descendants by Fatima are known as sharifs, syeds or sayyids. These are honorific titles in Arabic, sharif meaning 'noble' and sayed/sayid meaning 'lord' or 'sir'. As Muhammad's only descendants, they are respected by both Sunni and Shi'a, though the Shi'as place much more emphasis and value on the distinction.
Many Muslim notables claim to be descendents of Muhammad. The Hashemite royal families of Jordan and Iraq, the Alaouite royal family of Morocco, the Husseini family of Lebanon, and the Aga Khans of the Ismaili community claim direct descent from Muhammad through Ali and Fatima. Descendents of Ali with documented family trees (about 42 generations of an unbroken chain of descent) are often identified by their family trees leading to one of the 12 Shi'a Imams, most notably Imam Musa Kazem, Imam Ali Reza, and Imam Ali Naqi. Most syeds tend to cross-reference their own particular family trees with those of others in order to maintain accuracy and to weed out imposters.
Legacy

Ali is respected not only as a warrior and leader, but as a writer and religious authority. The most famous collection of speeches and letters attributed to Ali is the Peak of Eloquence (Arabic: Nahj al-Balagha).
There are other collections of his quotations.

Ghorarolhakam:The collections which is valid among Shia

A few famous quotations from it include: 

''Inability is a disaster; patience is bravery; abstinence is a treasure, self-restraint is a shield; and the best companion is submission to Divine Will.
Socialize with people in such a manner that when you die, they should weep for you and as long as you live, they should long for your company.
Greed is a permanent slavery.
Submission to God's will is the cure of the misery of the heart.
There is no wealth like education and no poverty like ignorance.

Ali is also reputed to have said:

He who has a thousand friends has not a friend to spare, while he who has one enemy will meet him everywhere.

Muslim view
Ali is revered and honored by all Muslims. Having been one of the first Muslims and foremost Islamic scholars, he was extremely knowledgeable in matters of religious belief and Islamic jurisprudence, as well as in the history of the Muslim community. He was known for his eloquence and heroism.
Just as Muslims do not picture God (in Arabic, Allah), but reference him by His Ninety-nine Names or titles, so Muslims honor Muhammad, Ali, and other pious Muslims with titles of praise and add pious interjections after their names.
Moreover, Sunni and Shi'a alike agree that Ali deserves these titles:

Prince of the Faithful (Arabic: Ameer-al-Momineen)
Father of Dust/Soil (Arabic: Abu Turab)
Lion of God (Arabic: Asad-ullah)
The Charging Lion (Arabic: Haydar-al-Karrar)
Piercing lines, fighter (Arabic: Safdar)





(Please note that translation from Arabic to English may change the way the words are interpreted)




Sunni view of Ali
The Sunnis regard Ali as one of the four Rightly Guided Caliphs and one of the most influential and respectful figures in Islam. A common misconception held by some Shiites is that Sunnis hate Imam Ali. In fact, Ali is held with the utmost respect along with the Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman. 
Alawite view of Ali
The Alawite tribe are the descendants of Imam Ali. The Alawite tribe followed Imam Ali in excepting the rightful protector of the Muslim community. Alawites call themselves Alaw&lt;U+012B&gt; (Arabic: &lt;U+0639&gt;&lt;U+0644&gt;&lt;U+0648&gt;&lt;U+064A&gt;&lt;U+200E&gt;). They take their name from Imam Ali, cousin and son-in-law of the prophet Muhammad. The term Alaw&lt;U+012B&gt; was recognized by the French when they occupied Syria in 1920. Historically, the Alawites have been called Nusayr&lt;U+012B&gt;s (Arabic &lt;U+0646&gt;&lt;U+0635&gt;&lt;U+064A&gt;&lt;U+0631&gt;&lt;U+064A&gt;&lt;U+0648&gt;&lt;U+0646&gt;), Namiriyya, and Ansariyya. The term Nusayriyya became one of insult, and they themselves preferred to be called Alawiyya to show their reverence for Ali. 
It is said that during the life of Imam Ali, a few of his devoted followers from Iraq, where Hellenistic and pagan cultures formed the background of many converts, described him as god-like, or the vehicle of a divine incarnation (Arabic &lt;U+062D&gt;&lt;U+0644&gt;&lt;U+0648&gt;&lt;U+0644&gt; hulul).[citation needed] The claim irritated Imam Ali profoundly, and he banished those who made it from his sight; but even today marginal Islamic sects such as the K&lt;U+0131&gt;z&lt;U+0131&gt;lba&lt;U+015F&gt; &quot;Redheads&quot; of Turkey, or the Alaw&lt;U+012B&gt; of the Syrian mountains, maintain an esoteric cosmology which asserts that God became incarnate in Ali[3], and then in the succession of Imams who descended from him. 
Shi'a view of Ali

The Shi&lt;U+2019&gt;ahs hold Ali ibn Abi Talib in high esteem as the rightful protector of the Muslim community after the passing of Muhammad, and considers him the first of twelve appointed hereditary Imams. Ali ibn Abi Talib as the first Imam is seen not only as Muhammad's chosen successor, but also as holding a position of authority designated by Allah and as deserving his position by his great personal merits.23
Shi`ites make several points regarding Ali, believed to indicate Ali's special status, including claims:

That he was born in the Kaaba. (see Birthplace of Ali).
Hadith of the dinner invitation: According to Tarikh Abul Fida, Muhammad arranged a dinner for the entire Banu Hashim where he openly declared his prophethood and call to Tawheed. After having said that the first one to join him would lead with him and be his successor, and three invitations, Ali was the only one ready to embrace Islam. Muhammad put his arms around him and said, &quot;He is my brother, inheritor and vicegerent. You must obey him.&quot; Then another dinner guest joked with Abu Talib saying that he was now under the command of his son.24
Hadith-i manzilah: Sa`ad ibn Abi Waqqas said Muhammad said to Ali, &quot;Are you not satisfied to be to me what Harun was to Moses except that after me there will not be another prophet?&quot; Shi'a said it means Ali is the vicegerent of Muhammad like Harun for Moses.25
