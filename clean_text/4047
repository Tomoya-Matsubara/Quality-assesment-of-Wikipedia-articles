The St. Johns-Indian River Barge Canal was a planned canal in the state of Florida, 1 in length and linking the Intracoastal Waterway and the Indian River  south of Oak Hill2 with the St. Johns River, originally intended to be just south of Lake Harney,3 but later shifted to be near Lake Monroe,4 with all but three miles of the route within Volusia County.5 However, by 1968 the more southerly Lake Harney alignment had returned to favor and the canal was not built.6
Originally proposed in the 1850s7, then again in 19098 and in the late 1930s,910 the St. Johns-Indian River Canal Authority was established in 1960.11 The canal would have been  wide12 and  deep,13 with three high-level and one bascule highway bridges, two bascule railroad bridges, two locks measuring  by , two navigation dams  wide, and a pumping station.14
Combined with the Cross Florida Barge Canal, the canal would have provided a shipping route across the Florida peninsula between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico;15 construction was planned to begin in 1968, with the canal to open in 1971,16 however construction never began as delays to the Cross Florida Barge Canal project mounted, with the projected groundbreaking pushed back first to 1970,17 then further, with conservation issues dogging the project18 especially with regard to spawning shad.1920
After the suspension of work on the Cross Florida Barge Canal, the Canal Authority was dissolved in 1973.2122
