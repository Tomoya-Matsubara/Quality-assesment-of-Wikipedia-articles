The Chrono series is a video game franchise owned by Square Enix (formerly Square Co.). It began in 1995 with the time travel console role-playing game Chrono Trigger, which spawned two continuations, Radical Dreamers and Chrono Cross. A promotional anime called Dimensional Adventure Numa Monjar and a port of Chrono Trigger were also produced.
As of March 31, 2003, Chrono Trigger was, with 2.65 million units, Square Enix's 12th best-selling game; Chrono Cross was, with 1.5 million units, the 24th.1 The games have been subject to generally positive criticism.
Design
Chrono Trigger was produced in 1995 by Kazuhiko Aoki and directed by Akihiko Matsui, Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita. The development of the game was dubbed the &quot;Dream Project&quot;, because it was headed by a &quot;Dream Team&quot; composed of supervisor Hironobu Sakaguchi, of Final Fantasy fame, as well as freelance supervisor Yuuji Horii and character designer Akira Toriyama, both of Dragon Quest fame.2 Yuuji Horii worked on the general outline of the story; as a fan of time travel fictions, such as the TV series Time Tunnel, he focused on a theme of time travel for Chrono Trigger.3 The outline was then finalized by story planner and script writer Masato Kato.4
In 1996, Masato Kato and several other members of the Chrono Trigger staff worked on a minor project for the Super Famicom Satellaview extension, titled Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai H&lt;U+014D&gt;seki. Initially, the game was intended to be a short, original text-based adventure developed in three months with almost no planning. Nevertheless, by the end of the development, Masato Kato had connected the game's plot and characters to Chrono Trigger, turning it into a side story. Since the platform of the game was not mainstream, the connections were however left blurred on purpose and were not advertised on the game's release.5
In 1999, a continuation of Chrono Trigger, titled Chrono Cross, was announced as being in development. Although the &quot;Dream Team&quot; members did not participate in Chrono Cross, the game was developed mostly by the same staff as the first installment.6 In terms of basic system and gameplay, producer Hiromichi Tanaka made it clear that the new installment was not a sequel to Chrono Trigger; rather, the game designers' approach was to make the &quot;gameplay evolve with the hardware&quot;, creating a completely new game while restructuring the former style so as to maximize the performance of the console.7 The gameplay focuses on the theme of paralel worlds rather than time travel, although the latter is still deeply involved in the game's plot. In terms of storyline, Chrono Cross was described by director and scenario writer Masato Kato as &quot;not a Chrono Trigger 2&quot;, but &quot;a result of a pulled trigger&quot;, &quot;another Chrono&quot;.8
Music

The music of the Chrono series was mainly composed by Yasunori Mitsuda. Chrono Trigger was the first for which he had served as composer. However, after Mitsuda contracted stomach ulcers, Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu was brought onto the project to compose ten songs.9 At the time of the game's release, the quantity of its tracks and sound effects were unprecedented.10 Additionally, a one-disc acid jazz arrangement called The Brink of Time was also released. Mitsuda went on to compose the soundtrack for Radical Dreamers, which was never commercially released as an album.
In 1999, Yasunori Mitsuda, now a freelance composer, returned to score the soundtrack for Chrono Cross after being contacted by Masato Kato.11 Mitsuda decided to center his work around old world cultural influences, including Mediterranean, Fado, Celtic, and percussive African music.12 Xenogears contributor Tomohiko Kira played guitar on the beginning and ending themes. Noriko Mitose, as selected by Masato Kato, sang the ending song, &quot;Radical Dreamers ~ Le Tr&lt;U+00E9&gt;sor Interdit&quot;.13 Mitsuda was happy to accomplish even half of what he envisioned.14 Certain songs were ported from the score of Radical Dreamers, while other entries in the soundtrack contain leitmotifs from both Chrono Trigger and Radical Dreamers.15
In 2006, Yasunori Mitsuda arranged versions of music from the Chrono series for Play! video game music concerts, presenting the Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross main themes, as well as &quot;Frog's Theme&quot;, and &quot;To Far Away Times&quot;.16
Games
Chrono Trigger
   is a console role-playing game which was released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on March 11, 1995 in Japan and on August 22, 1995 in North America. The game's story follows a group of young adventurers led by Crono, who are accidentally transported through time and learn that the world will be destroyed in the distant future. Vowing to prevent this disaster, they travel throughout history to discover the means to save the planet.

Radical Dreamers


is a Japanese-exclusive text-based game released in 1996 through the Super Famicom Satellaview extension. The player takes on the role of Serge, a young adventurer accompanied by Kid, a teen-aged thief, and Gil, a mysterious masked magician. It is a side story to Chrono Trigger wrapping up a loose end from its predecessor's plot.17
Chrono Cross
   was released on the PlayStation on November 18, 1999 in Japan and on August 15, 2000 in North America. The story is partly a remake of Radical Dreamers, and as such replaces it as Chrono Trigger's successor. The protagonist Serge, faced with an alternate reality in which he died as a child, struggles to uncover his past and meets Kid, a thief seeking the mysterious Frozen Flame artifact. Serge and Kid's fate are ultimately revealed to find their roots in the events of Chrono Trigger.
Chrono Break

Chrono Brake and Chrono Break are the names of two trademarks owned by Square Co.; the first applied in Japan on November 5, 2001,18 and the second registered in the United States on December 5 of the same year.19 The registrations were preceded by a press report in which Hironobu Sakaguchi mentioned that the Chrono Cross team was interested in developing a new game in the Chrono series, and that script and story ideas were being considered.20 However, Square did not publish further news, and the American trademark Chrono Break was eventually dropped on November 13, 2003.
Dimensional Adventure Numa Monjar
  is a 16-minute humoristic and promotional Chrono Trigger anime which was broadcast at the Japanese V-Jump Festival of July 31, 1996. It was created by Production I.G, and written by Hiroshi Izawa and Akihiro Kikuchi, while Itsuro Kawazaki served as director, Tensai Okamura as animation director, and Riho Nishino as character designer. It was never commercially released.2122
The anime takes place in the same setting as Chrono Trigger, the night before the beginning of the game's events. The empty Millennial Fair is invested by a festive gathering of monsters coming through portals. The two protagonists, a Nu and a Mamo (a type of monster called Kilwala in the English version of the game), voiced by Chaf&lt;U+016B&gt;rin and Mayumi Tanaka respectively, try to recruit members for their group &quot;Nuumamonjaa&quot;. Finding no one willing to join them, they wander the fair and interrupt the robot Johnny's show, who is voiced by Shinichir&lt;U+014D&gt; Miki.
Later, Nu enters a drinking contest and wins a golden shovel, with the help of a controller that resembles that of a Super Famicom. Nu goes into the bushes after the contest to urinate, and stumbles upon Gonzalez (a robot called Gato in the English version of the game). Gonzalez, voiced by Fumihiko Tachiki, activates and chases the group, while singing his line from the game: Aa Gonzaresu. Ore-wa tsuyoi. Ore ni kattara shirubaa pointo (&quot;Ah, Gonzalez. I am strong. Beat me up and get silver points&quot;).
Eventually, Nu and Mamo end up on Gonzalez' back as he runs uncontrollably, entering a race against Johnny. In an attempt to stop Gonzalez, Nu presses a large button on Gonzales' back, which causes a large boxing glove on a spring to hit Johnny. A dazed Johnny flies through the air and solemnly recites a haiku before smashing into a wall. Gonzalez' singing voice can still be heard from where Nu and Mamo are.
In the morning, Gato is still singing, but runs out of power and falls to the ground. A group of people is seen watching in the foreground, including Crono and Lucca. The credits show Nu and Mamo parodying scenes from the game.
