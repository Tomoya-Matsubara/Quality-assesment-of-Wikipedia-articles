Kelly Richey (born November 30, 1962 in Lexington, Kentucky) is a blues rock guitarist, singer and composer based out of Cincinnati, Ohio.
Career
Kelly Richey's first instrument was the piano. Her second instrument was a drum kit that her neighbor let her take home. After a couple of months of playing drums in her bedroom, her father offered to buy her anything she wanted. In place of the drums she was introduced to the guitar as a teenager and instantly fell in love with the instrument. With the guitar strapped around her body, Kelly practiced everywhere she went- church, school, and the kitchen table.
Kelly Richey joined the Arista Records group, Stealin' Horses in 1986. Through playing various styles of music and getting in touch with her gospel roots, Kelly realized that her true passion was the blues. In 1990, she formed The Kelly Richey Band (KRB), featuring Kelly as a lead blues rock guitarist and vocalist. KRB has become both a national and international touring band and is backed by David Clawson on drums and Jimmy Valdez on bass.
Influences
Jimi Hendrix, Roy Buchanan, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, Janis Joplin, and Bonnie Raitt. Kelly Richey was once described by a music critic as: &lt;U+201C&gt;Stevie Ray Vaughan trapped in a woman&lt;U+2019&gt;s body with Janis Joplin screaming to get out.&lt;U+201D&gt;
