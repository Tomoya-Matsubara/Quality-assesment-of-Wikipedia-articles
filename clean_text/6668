Pobeda, lang-ru  Victory, was the last of the three sclass Peresvet battleship 0 pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy at the end of the nineteenth century. The ship was assigned to the Russian Pacific Fleet Pacific Squadron upon completion and based at Lshunkou District Port Arthur from 1903. During the Russo-Japanese War of 19041905, she participated in the Battle of Port Arthur battles of Port Arthur and the Battle of the Yellow Sea Yellow Sea. Having escaped serious damage in these engagements, Pobeda was sunk by siege gun gunfire during the Siege of Port Arthur, and then marine salvage salvaged by the Japanese and placed into service under the name nihongo Suwo  .

Rearmed and re-boilered by the Japanese, Suwo was reclassified by the Imperial Japanese Navy IJN as a coastal defense ship in 1908 and served as a training ship for several years. She was the flagship of the Japanese squadron that participated in the Battle of Tsingtao at the beginning of World War I and continued in that role until she became a gunnery training ship in 1917. The ship was disarmed in 1922 to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and probably ship breaking scrapped around that time.

Design and description
The design of the Peresvet class was inspired by the Royal Navy British second-class battleships typically faster, but with thinner armor and smaller guns than first-class battleships of the sclass- Centurion battleship 4. The British ships were intended to defeat commerce-raiding armored cruisers like the Russian ships ship Russian cruiser Rossia  2 and ship Russian cruiser Rurik 1892 2, and the Peresvet class was designed to support the armored cruisers. This role placed a premium on high speed and long range at the expense of heavy armament and armor.McLaughlin 2003, p. 108

Pobeda was convert 434 ft 5 in m 1 length overall long overall, had a Beam nautical beam of convert 71 ft 6 in m and a Draft hull draft of convert 26 ft 3 in m 1. Designed to displace convert 12674 LT t lk=in, she was almost convert 600 LT t overweight and displaced convert 13320 LT t. Her crew consisted of 27 officers and 744 enlisted men. The ship was powered by three Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion vertical triple-expansion steam engines using steam generated by 30 Belleville boilers. The engines were rated at convert 14500 ihp lk=in, using forced draught, and designed to reach a top speed of convert 18 kn lk=in. Pobeda, however, reached a top speed of convert 18.5 kn from convert 15578 ihp during her sea trials in October 1901. She carried a maximum of convert 2060 LT t of coal, which allowed her to steam for convert 6200 lk=in nmi at a speed of convert 10 kn.McLaughlin 2003, pp. 10708, 114

The ship's main battery consisted of four convert 10 in mm 0 adj=on guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. The Battleship secondary armament secondary armament consisted of eleven Canet guns Canet convert 6 in mm 0 adj=on quick-firing gun quick-firing QF guns, mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull and in the bow, underneath the forecastle. Several smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats. These included twenty convert 75 mm adj=on sp=us QF guns, twenty convert 47 mm adj=on sp=us Hotchkiss guns and eight convert 37 mm adj=on sp=us guns. She was also armed with five convert 15 in adj=on 0 torpedo tubes, three above water and two submerged. The ship carried 45 Naval mine mines to be used to protect her anchorage. Pobeda's waterline belt armor armor belt consisted of Krupp cemented armor and was convert 4 - 9 in 0 thick. The armor of her gun turrets had a maximum thickness of convert 9 in mm 0 abbr=on and her deck ship deck ranged from convert 2 to 3 in 0 in thickness.McLaughlin 2003, pp. 10708, 11214

Construction and service
Pobeda VictorySilverstone, p. 382 was ordered on 26 April 1898 from the Baltic Shipyard Baltic Works and construction began on 30 May 1898 at the company's Saint Petersburg shipyard, well before the formal keel laying keel-laying ceremony on 21 February 1899. The ship was Ship naming and launching launched on 10 May 1900 and towed to Kronstadt on 31 August 1901 for fitting out. She made her machinery trials in October, well before she was completed the next year. She sailed to Reval modern Tallinn on 1 August to participate in the naval review held there a few days later to commemorate the visit of the German Kaiser, Wilhelm II, to Russia. Pobeda entered service upon completing her artillery trials on October 1902, although she was not officially accepted until 10 March 1903,McLaughlin 2008, pp. 4748 at a cost of 10,050,000 rubles.McLaughlin 2003, p. 112 She had already sailed from Liepja Libau on 13 November 1902 and arrived at Port Arthur on 13 June 1903 for assignment to the Pacific Squadron.McLaughlin 2003, p. 115

Battle of Port Arthur

After the Japanese victory in the First Sino-Japanese War of 189495, tensions had arisen between Russia and Japan over their ambitions to control both Manchuria and Korea. A further issue was the Russian failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903, as it had promised. Japan had begun negotiations to ease the situation in 1901, but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems. Japan interpreted these as deliberate prevarications designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs. The final straws were news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea. These led the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was now inevitable. The Pacific Squadron began wikt:moor mooring in the outer harbor at night as tensions with Japan increased, so as to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea.Westwood, pp. 1521

On the night of 8/9 February 1904, the IJN launched a Battle of Port Arthur surprise attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur. Pobeda was not hit in the initial torpedo-boat attack, and sortied the following morning when the Combined Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Tg Heihachir, attacked. Tg had expected the surprise night attack by his ships to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser ship Russian cruiser Boyarin 1901 2, which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defenses. Tg chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese convert 8 in 0 adj=on sp=in and six-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. Pobeda was hit once or twice amidships near the waterline, losing two men killed and four wounded, but the shells failed to penetrate the ship's armor and little damage was done.Forczyk, pp. 4143; McLaughlin 2008, p. 48

On 22 March, Pobeda joined several other battleships firing indirectly at Japanese ships bombarding Port Arthur's harbor and hit the ship Japanese battleship Fuji once, killing seven men.McLaughlin, p. 48 She participated in the action of 13 April, when Tg successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov's flagship, the battleship ship Russian battleship Petropavlovsk 1897 2. When Makarov spotted the five Japanese battleships, he turned back for Port Arthur, and Petropavlovsk struck a mine laid by the Japanese the previous night. The ship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazine artillery magazines exploded, and Makarov was one of the 677 killed. When Pobeda was returning to port after Petropavlovsk sank, she struck a mine herself, but was able to steam to the harbor under her own power despite an 11 list watercraft list.Forczyk, pp. 43, 4546 Her repairs were completed on 9 June although some of her guns were removed during this time to reinforce the defenses of the port. Pobeda lost a total of three 6-inch, two 75-millimeter, one 47-millimeter and four 37-millimeter guns.McLaughlin 2003, pp. 115, 163 She sailed with the rest of the Russian squadron on 23 June in an abortive attempt to reach Vladivostok. The new fleet commander, Vice Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, ordered the squadron to return to Port Arthur when it encountered the Japanese fleet shortly before sunset as he did not wish to engage the numerically superior Japanese in a night battle.Warner & Warner, pp. 30506 Pobeda bombarded Japanese positions besieging the port on 28 July.

Battle of the Yellow Sea
main Battle of the Yellow Sea
The Japanese bombardment of 9 August, coupled with a direct order from Tsar Nicholas II of Russia Nicholas II, forced Vitgeft to make another attempt to reach Vladivostok. The squadron sortied in an attempt to escape to Vladivostok the next morning. At 12:25, it was spotted by Japanese cruisers and intercepted by the Combined Fleet in what became the Battle of the Yellow Sea. Pobeda was third in line during the battle,Forczyk, p. 48 and was not seriously damaged during the early long-range stage of the action. Around 18:00, two 12-inch shells from the battleship ship Japanese battleship Asahi  2 penetrated the conning tower of the Russian flagship ship Russian battleship Tsesarevich  2, killing Vitgeft and the helmsman, severely wounding the captain nautical captain, and causing the ship to come to a dead stop after executing a sharp turn. Thinking that this was a maneuver planned by Vitgeft, the Russian battleline started to execute the same turn, causing all of the ships directly behind Tsesarevich, including Pobeda, to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting the stationary flagship.

As the Japanese ships continued to pound the Tsesarevich, the battleship ship Russian battleship Retvizan  2 boldly charged Tg's battleline in an attempt to divert the Japanese shellfire, followed shortly afterward by Peresvet, the flagship of the squadron's second-in-command, Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky. The Japanese battleline immediately shifted fire to the oncoming ships, badly damaging both and forcing them to turn away.McLaughlin 2003, p. 163 Ukhtomsky signaled the other Russian ships to follow him back to Port Arthur, but the signal was hard to discern because the flags had to be hung from the bridge nautical bridge railings because Peresvet's topmasts had been shot away and were only gradually recognized.McLaughlin 2008, p. 46 Although Pobeda was struck by eleven large-caliber hits that killed 4 men and wounded 29, including one below the waterline, they failed to penetrate her armor and she reached Port Arthur without any difficulties. The hits did, however, knock out one 10-inch gun and three 75-millimeter guns.

Siege of Port Arthur

Returning to Port Arthur on 11 August, the Russian squadron found the city still under siege by the Japanese Third Army led by Baron Nogi Maresuke. The new commander, Rear Admiral Robert N. Viren, decided to use the men and guns of the Pacific Squadron to reinforce the defenses of Port Arthur and even more guns were stripped from the squadron's ships. This proved to make little difference and Pobeda was struck by several convert 5.9 in adj=on and 4.7-inch shells on 28 September that did no significant damage. The Japanese bombardment with medium guns continued for the next month and a half and the ship was repeatedly struck, without much effect. Japanese troops were able to seize 203 Hill which overlooked the harbor on 5 December. This allowed the Imperial Japanese Army's convert 28 cm adj=on sp=us siege guns to fire directly at the Russian ships; they hit Pobeda approximately 30 times and sank her in shallow water on 7 December 1904.McLaughlin 2003, pp. 115, 16364 Russian attempts to destroy the ship before they surrendered were frustrated because her vital parts were already underwater.

Pobeda was refloated by Japanese engineers on 17 October 1905 and was classified as a 1st-class battleship by the IJN. She was renamed as Suwo on 25 October,Lengerer, p. 44 after the eponymous Suo Province ancient province.Silverstone, p. 337 She steamed under her own power to Sasebo Naval Arsenal, where she arrived on 16 December and began temporary repairs. Her reconstruction at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal began in May 1906 and lasted until 10 October 1908.

To improve her stability, Suwo's forward Top sailing ship fighting top was removed. The 6-inch bow gun was also removed and all of her light guns were replaced by 20 QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun QF 12-pounder 12 cwtCwt is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. guns. Two above-water British 18 inch torpedo 18-inch torpedo tubes replaced her original torpedo armament and her crew now numbered 791 officers and enlisted men.Lengerer, pp. 4344

Suwo was re-designated as a 1st class coastal defense ship on 28 August 1912 and became a training ship for cadets and engineers. Initially assigned to the 1st Standing Squadron when World War I began, she shortly afterwards became the flagship of the 2nd Squadron, commanded by Vice Admiral Kato Sadakichi. The squadron was tasked to blockade the German-owned port of Tsingtao, China, and to cooperate with the Imperial Japanese Army in capturing the city. Tango and the other ships of the squadron, reinforced by the British pre-dreadnought HMS Triumph 1903 6, bombarded German fortifications throughout the siege until the Germans surrendered on 7 November.McLaughlin 2008, p. 49; Stephenson, pp. 136, 162, 166 Suwo served as flagship of the Second Squadron of the Second Fleet in 191516 before becoming a gunnery training ship at Yokosuka for the rest of the war.Preston, p. 186 In April 1922, in compliance with the Washington Naval Treaty, Suwo was disarmed at the Kure Naval Arsenal.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 20 While her armor was being removed, the ship capsized on 13 July. She was probably scrapped in 192223, but at least one source suggests she was refloated and hulked, serving until being broken up at Kure in 1946.McLaughlin 2008, p. 49#tag:ref She is not listed, however, in Fukui Shinzo's authoritative Japanese Naval Vessels at the End of World War II. group=Note
