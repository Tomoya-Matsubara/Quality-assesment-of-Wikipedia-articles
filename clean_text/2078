Antoni Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; i Cornet (; 25 June 1852–10 June 1926) was a Spanish Catalan architect and figurehead of Catalan Modernism. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s works reflect his highly individual and distinctive style and are largely concentrated in the Catalan capital of Barcelona, including his magnum opus, the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia.
Much of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s work was marked by his four life passions: architecture, nature, religion and love for Catalonia.1 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; studied every detail of his creations, integrating into his architecture a series of crafts in which he was skilled, such as ceramics, stained glass, wrought ironwork forging and carpentry. He introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials, such as trencad&lt;U+00ED&gt;s, made of waste ceramic pieces.
After a few years under the influence of neo-Gothic art and Oriental techniques, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; became part of the Catalan Modernista movement which was then reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s work transcended mainstream Modernisme, culminating in an organic style inspired by nature. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; rarely drew detailed plans of his works, instead preferring to create them as three-dimensional scale models and molding the details as he was conceiving them.
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s work enjoys widespread international appeal and there are many studies devoted to understanding his architecture. Today, his work finds admirers among architects and the general public alike. His masterpiece, the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia, is one of the most visited monuments in Spain.2 Between 1984 and 2005, seven of his works were declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s Roman Catholic faith intensified during his life and religious images permeate his work. This earned him the nickname &quot;God's Architect&quot;3 and led to calls for his beatification.456 
Biography
Birth, childhood and studies
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was born in 1852 in Riudoms or in Reus,7 to the industrial boilermaker Francesc Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; i Serra (1813–1906) and Ant&lt;U+00F2&gt;nia Cornet i Bertran (1819–1876). He was the youngest of five children, of whom three survived to adulthood: Rosa (1844–1879), Francesc (1851–1876) and Antoni. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s family origins go back to the Auvergne region in southern France, from where one of his ancestors, Joan Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;, a hawker, moved to Catalonia in the 17th century; possible origins of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s family name include Gaudy or Gaudin.8  Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s exact birthplace is unknown because no supporting documents survive, leading to a controversy about whether he was born in Reus or Riudoms, two neighbouring municipalities of the Baix Camp district. Most of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s identification documents from both his student and professional years gave Reus as his birthplace. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; stated on various occasions that he was born in Riudoms, his paternal family's village.9 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was baptised in the church of Sant Pere Ap&lt;U+00F2&gt;stol in Reus the day after his birth under the name &quot;Antoni Pl&lt;U+00E0&gt;cid Guillem Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; i Cornet&quot;.10
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; felt a deep appreciation for his native land and great pride in his Mediterranean heritage. He believed Mediterranean people to be endowed with creativity, originality and an innate sense for art and design. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; reportedly described this distinction by stating, &quot;We own the image. Fantasy comes from the ghosts. Fantasy is what people in the North own. We are concrete. The image comes from the Mediterranean. Orestes knows his way, where Hamlet is torn apart by his doubts.&quot;11 Time spent outdoors, particularly during summer stays in the Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; family home Mas de la Calderera, afforded Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; the opportunity to study nature. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s enjoyment of the natural world led him to join the Centre Excursionista de Catalunya in 1879 at the age of 27. The organisation arranged expeditions that enabled Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; to explore Catalonia and southern France, often riding on horseback or walking ten kilometres a day.12  Young Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; suffered from poor health, including rheumatism, which may have contributed to his rather reticent and reserved character.13 These health concerns and the hygienist theories of Dr. Kneipp14 were contributing factors to Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s decision to adopt vegetarianism early in his life.1516 His religious faith coupled with strict vegetarianism led him to undertake several lengthy and severe fasts. These fasts were often unhealthy and occasionally, as in 1894, led to life-threatening illness.17
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s attended a nursery school run by Francesc Berenguer, whose son, also called Francesc, later became one of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s main assistants. He enrolled in the Piarists school in Reus where he displayed his artistic talents via drawings for a seminar called El Arlequ&lt;U+00ED&gt;n (the Harlequin).18 During this time he worked as an apprentice in the &quot;Vapor Nou&quot; textile mill in Reus. In 1868 he moved to Barcelona to study teaching in the Convent del Carme. In his adolescent years Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; became interested in utopian socialism and, together with his fellow students Eduard Toda i G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell and Josep Ribera i Sans, planned a restoration of the Poblet monastery that would have transformed it into a Utopian phalanst&lt;U+00E8&gt;re.19
Between 1875 and 1878, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; completed his compulsory military service in the infantry regiment in Barcelona as a Military Administrator. Most of his service was spent on sick leave, enabling him to continue his studies. Due to his poor health he was not forced to fight in the Third Carlist War, which lasted from 1872 to 1876.20 In 1876 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s mother died at the age of 57, as did his 25-year-old brother Francesc, who had just graduated as a physician. During this time Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; studied architecture at the Llotja School and the Barcelona Higher School of Architecture, graduating in 1878. To finance his studies, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; worked as a draughtsman for various architects and constructors such as Leandre Serrallach, Joan Martorell, Emili Sala Cort&lt;U+00E9&gt;s, Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano and Josep Fontser&lt;U+00E8&gt;.21 In addition to his architecture classes, he attended French lectures and studied history, economics, philosophy and aesthetics. His grades were average and he occasionally failed courses.22 When handing him his degree, Elies Rogent, director of Barcelona Architecture School, said: &quot;We have given this academic title either to a fool or a genius. Time will show.&quot;23 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;, when receiving his degree, reportedly told his friend the sculptor Lloren&lt;U+00E7&gt; Matamala, with his ironical sense of humour, &quot;Lloren&lt;U+00E7&gt;, they&lt;U+2019&gt;re saying I&lt;U+2019&gt;m an architect now.&quot;24
Adulthood and professional work

Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; and Eusebi G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell on a visit to the Col&lt;U+00F2&gt;nia G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell (1910)

Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s first projects were the lampposts he designed for the Pla&lt;U+00E7&gt;a Reial in Barcelona, the unfinished Girossi newsstands, and the Cooperativa Obrera Mataronense (Workers' Cooperative of Matar&lt;U+00F3&gt;) building. He gained wider recognition for his first important commission, the Casa Vicens, and subsequently received more significant requests. At the Paris World's Fair of 1878 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; displayed a showcase he had produced for the glove manufacturer Comella. Its functional and aesthetic modernista design impressed Catalan industrialist Eusebi G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell, who then commissioned some of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s most outstanding work: the G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell wine cellars, the G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell pavilions, the Palau G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell (G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell palace), the Park G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell (G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell park) and the crypt of the church of the Col&lt;U+00F2&gt;nia G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; also became a friend of the marquis of Comillas, the father-in-law of Count G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell, for whom he designed &quot;El Capricho&quot; in Comillas.
In 1883 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was put in charge of the recently-initiated project to build a Barcelona cathedral called Bas&lt;U+00ED&gt;lica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia (Basilica and Expiatory Church of the Holy Family, or Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia). Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; completely changed the initial design and imbued it with his own distinctive style. From 1915 until his death he devoted himself entirely to this project. Given the number of commissions he began receiving, he had to rely on his team to work on multiple projects simultaneously. His team consisted of professionals from all fields of construction. Several of the architects who worked under him made their own name in the field later on, such as Josep Maria Jujol, Joan Rubi&lt;U+00F3&gt;, C&lt;U+00E8&gt;sar Martinell, Francesc Folguera and Josep Francesc R&lt;U+00E0&gt;fols. In 1885, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; moved to rural Sant Feliu de Codines to escape the cholera epidemic that was ravaging Barcelona. He lived in Francesc Ullar&lt;U+2019&gt;s house, for whom he designed a dinner table25 as a sign of his gratitude.

Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s exposition licence at the Exposici&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Universal de Barcelona (1888) 

The 1888 World Fair was one of the era's major events in Barcelona and represented a key point in the history of the Modernisme movement. The leading architects of the time displayed their best works at the fair, including Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;, who showcased the building he had designed for the Compa&lt;U+00F1&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Trasatl&lt;U+00E1&gt;ntica (Transatlantic Company). Consequently he received a commission to restructure the Sal&lt;U+00F3&gt; de Cent of the Barcelona City Council, but this project was ultimately not carried out. In the early 1890s Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; received two commissions from outside of Catalonia, namely the Bishop's Palace of Astorga and the Casa Botines in Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n. These works contributed to Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s growing renown across Spain. In 1891, he travelled to M&lt;U+00E1&gt;laga and Tangiers to examine the plot of land for a project for the Franciscan Catholic Missions that the 2nd marquis of Comillas had requested him to design.26  In 1899 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; joined the Cercle Art&lt;U+00ED&gt;stic de Sant Lluc (Saint Luke artistic circle), a Catholic artistic society founded in 1893 by the bishop Josep Torras i Bages and the brothers Josep and Joan Llimona. He also became a member of the Lliga Espiritual de la Mare de D&lt;U+00E9&gt;u de Montserrat (spiritual league of Our lady of Montserrat), another Catholic Catalan organisation.27 The conservative and religious character of his political thought was closely linked to the defence of the cultural identity of the Catalan people.28
At the beginning of the century, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was working on numerous projects simultaneously. All of them reflected his shift to a more personal style inspired by nature. In 1900, he received an award for the best building of the year from the Barcelona City Council for his Casa Calvet. During the first decade of the century Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; dedicated himself to projects like the Casa Figueras (Figueras house, better known as Bellesguard), the Park G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell, an unsuccessful urbanisation project, and the restoration of the Cathedral of Palma de Mallorca, for which he visited Majorca several times. Between 1904 and 1910 he constructed the Casa Batll&lt;U+00F3&gt; (Batll&lt;U+00F3&gt; house) and the Casa Mil&lt;U+00E0&gt; (Mil&lt;U+00E1&gt; house), two of his most emblematic works.

Saint Philip Neri celebrating the Holy Mass by Joan Llimona (church of Sant Felip Neri (Barcelona). Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was the model for Saint Philip Neri&lt;U+2019&gt;s face.

As a result of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s increasing fame, in 1902 the painter Joan Llimona chose Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s features to represent Saint Philip Neri in the paintings in the aisle of the Sant Felip Neri church in Barcelona.29 Together with Joan Santal&lt;U+00F3&gt;, son of his friend the physician Pere Santal&lt;U+00F3&gt;, he unsuccessfully founded a wrought iron manufacturing company the same year.30
After moving to Barcelona, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; frequently changed his address: as a student he lived in residences, generally in the area of the Gothic Quarter; when he started his career he moved around several rented flats in the Eixample area. Finally, in 1906, he settled in a house in the G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell Park that he owned and which had been constructed by his assistant Francesc Berenguer as a showcase property for the estate. It has since been transformed into the Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; Museum. There he lived with his father (who died in 1906 at the age of 93) and his niece Rosa Egea Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; (who died in 1912 at the age of 36). He lived in the house until 1925, several months before his death, at which time he began residing inside the workshop of the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia.
One of the events that had a profound impact on Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s personality was Tragic Week in 1909. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; remained in his house in the G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell Park during this turbulent period. The anticlerical atmosphere and attacks on churches and convents caused Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; to worry for the safety of the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia, but the building escaped damage.31
In 1910, an exhibition in the Grand Palais of Paris was devoted to his work, during the annual salon of the Soci&lt;U+00E9&gt;t&lt;U+00E9&gt; des Beaux-Arts (Fine Arts Society) of France. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; participated on the invitation of count G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell, displaying a series of pictures, plans and plaster scale models of several of his works. Although he participated hors concours, he received very good reviews from the French press. A large part of this exposition could be seen the following year at the I Sal&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Nacional de Arquitectura that took place in the municipal exhibition hall of Buen Retiro in Madrid.32
During the Paris exposition in May 1910, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; spent a holiday in Vic, where he designed two basalt lampposts and wrought iron for the Pla&lt;U+00E7&gt;a Major of Vic in honor of Jaume Balmes&lt;U+2019&gt;s centenary. The following year he resided as a convalescent in Puigcerd&lt;U+00E0&gt; while suffering from tuberculosis. During this time he conceived the idea for the facade of the Passion of the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia.33 Due to ill health he prepared a will at the office of the notary Ramon Cant&lt;U+00F3&gt; i Figueres on 9 June, but later he completely recovered.34
The decade from 1910 was a hard one for Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;. During this decade, the architect experienced the deaths of his niece Rosa in 1912 and his main collaborator Francesc Berenguer in 1914; a severe economic crisis which paralysed work on the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia in 1915; the 1916 death of his friend Josep Torras i Bages, bishop of Vic; the 1917 disruption of work at the Colonia G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell; and the 1918 death of his friend and patron Eusebi G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell.35 Perhaps because of all these tragedies he devoted himself entirely to the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia from 1915, taking refuge in his work. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; confessed to his collaborators:

Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; dedicated the last years of his life entirely to the &lt;U+201C&gt;Cathedral of the Poor&lt;U+201D&gt;, as it was commonly known, for which he took alms in order to continue. Apart from his dedication to this cause, he participated in few other activities, the majority of which were related to religion: in 1916 he participated in a course about Gregorian chant at the Palau de la M&lt;U+00FA&gt;sica Catalana taught by the Benedictine monk Gregori M. Sunyol.36
Personal life
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; devoted his life entirely to his profession, remaining single. He is only known to have been attracted to one woman—Josefa Moreu, teacher at the Matar&lt;U+00F3&gt; Cooperative, in 1884—but this was not reciprocated.37 From then on, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; took refuge in the profound spiritual peace religion offered him. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; is often depicted as unsociable and unpleasant, a man of gruff reactions and arrogant gestures. However, those who were close to him described him as friendly and polite, pleasant to talk to and faithful to friends. Among these, his patrons Eusebi G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell and the bishop of Vic, Josep Torras i Bages, stand out, as well as the writers Joan Maragall and Jacint Verdaguer, the physician Pere Santal&lt;U+00F3&gt; and some of his most faithful collaborators, such as Francesc Berenguer and Lloren&lt;U+00E7&gt; Matamala.38
 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s personal appearance—Nordic features, blond hair and blue eyes—changed radically over the course of time. As a young man, he dressed like a dandy in costly suits, sporting well-groomed hair and beard, indulging gourmet taste, making frequent visits to the theatre and the opera and visiting his project sites in a horse carriage. When older, he became a man of strict simplicity who ate frugally, used old, worn-out suits, and neglected his appearance to the extent that sometimes he was taken for a beggar, such as after the accident that caused his death.39
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; left hardly any written documents, apart from technical reports of his works required by official authorities, some letters to friends (particularly to Joan Maragall) and a few journal articles. Some quotes collected by his assistants and disciples have been preserved, above all by Josep Francesc R&lt;U+00E0&gt;fols, Joan Berg&lt;U+00F3&gt;s, C&lt;U+00E8&gt;sar Martinell and Isidre Puig i Boada. The only written document Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; left is known as the Manuscrito de Reus (Reus Manuscript) (1873–1878), a kind of student diary in which he collected diverse impressions of architecture and decorating, putting forward his ideas on the subject. Included are an analysis of the Christian church and of his ancestral house, as well as a text about ornamentation and comments on the design of a desk.40
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was always in favour of statehood for Catalonia but was reluctant to become politically active. Politicians, such as Francesc Camb&lt;U+00F3&gt; and Enric Prat de la Riba, suggested that he run for deputy but he refused. Nonetheless, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; experienced conflict with the police. In 1920 he was beaten by police in a riot during the Floral Games celebrations.41 On 11 September 1924, National Day of Catalonia, he was beaten at a demonstration against the banning of the Catalan language by the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was arrested by the Civil Guard, resulting in a short stay in prison, from which he was freed after paying 50 pesetas bail.42
Death
 On 7 June 1926, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was taking his daily walk to the Sant Felip Neri church for his habitual prayer and confession. While walking along the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes between Girona and Bail&lt;U+00E9&gt;n streets, he was struck by a passing tram and lost consciousness.43 Assumed to be a beggar because of his lack of identity documents and shabby clothing, the unconscious Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; did not receive immediate aid. Eventually a police officer transported him in a taxi to the Santa Creu Hospital, where he received rudimentary care.44 By the time that the chaplain of the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia, Mos&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Gil Par&lt;U+00E9&gt;s, recognised him on the following day, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s condition had deteriorated too severely to benefit from additional treatment. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; died on 10 June 1926 at the age of 73 and was buried two days later. A large crowd gathered to bid farewell to him in the chapel of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in the crypt of the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia. His gravestone bears an inscription that reads, &quot;Antonius Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; Cornet. Reusensis. Annos natus LXXIV, vitae exemplaris vir, eximiusque artifex, mirabilis operis hujus, templi auctor, pie obiit Barcinone die X Junii MCMXXVI, hinc cineres tanti hominis, resurrectionem mortuorum expectant. R.I.P.&quot;45
Subsequent reputation
After his death, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s works suffered a period of neglect and were largely unpopular among international critics, who regarded them as baroque and excessively imaginative. In his homeland he was equally disdained by Noucentisme, the new movement which took the place of Modernisme. In 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s workshop in the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia was ransacked and a great number of his documents, plans and scale models were destroyed.
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s reputation was beginning to recover by the 1950s, when his work was championed not only by Salvador Dal&lt;U+00ED&gt; but also by architect Josep Llu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Sert. In 1952, the centenary year of the architect&lt;U+2019&gt;s birth, the Asociaci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n de Amigos de Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; (Friends of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; Association) was founded with the aim of disseminating and conserving his legacy. Four years later, a retrospective was organised at the Sal&lt;U+00F3&gt; del Tinell in Barcelona, and the Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; Chair at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia was created with the purpose of deepening the study of the Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s works and participating in their conservation. These events were followed in 1957 by Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s first international exhibition, held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. In 1976, on the 50th anniversary of his death, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs organised an exhibition about Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; and his works that toured the globe.46
Between 1950 and 1960, research and writings by international critics like George R. Collins, Nikolaus Pevsner and Roberto Pane spread a renewed awareness of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s work, while in his homeland it was admired and promoted by Alexandre Cirici, Juan Eduardo Cirlot and Oriol Bohigas. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s work has since gained widespread international appreciation, such as in Japan where notable studies have been published by Kenji Imai and Tokutoshi Torii. International recognition of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s contributions to the field of architecture and design culminated in the 1984 listing of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s key works as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.47
Due to Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s profoundly religious and ascetic lifestyle, the archbishop of Barcelona, Ricard Maria Carles proposed Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s beatification in 1998. His beatification was approved by the Vatican in 2000.48 On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s birth, a number of official ceremonies, concerts, shows and conferences were held, and several books were published. On 24 September of the same year, the musical Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; had its premiere in the Palau dels Esports de Barcelona. The authors of the piece were Jordi Galceran, Esteve Miralles and Albert Guinovart.49 In 2008 the Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; Awards were launched in his honour, organised by the Catalan Film Academy to award the best Catalan films of the year.50
Style
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; and Modernisme

The four-armed cross, one of the most typical features of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s works

Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s professional life was distinctive in that he never ceased to investigate mechanical structures of buildings. Early on, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was inspired by oriental arts (India, Persia, Japan) through the study of the historicist architectural theoreticians, such as Walter Pater, John Ruskin and William Morris. The influence of the Oriental movement can be seen in works like the Capricho, the G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell Palace, the G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell Pavilions and the Casa Vicens. Later on, he adhered to the neo-Gothic movement that was in fashion at the time, following the ideas of the French architect Viollet-le-Duc. This influence is reflected in the Colegi de les Teresianes, the bishop's palace in Astorga, the Casa Botines and the Bellesguard house as well as in the crypt and the apse of the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia. Eventually, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; embarked on a more personal phase, with the organic style inspired by nature in which he would build his major works.
During his time as a student, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was able to study a collection of photographs of Egyptian, Indian, Persian, Mayan, Chinese and Japanese art owned by the School of Architecture. The collection also included Moorish monuments in Spain, which left a deep mark on him and served as an inspiration in many of his works. He also studied the book Plans, elevations, sections and details of the Alhambra by Owen Jones, which he borrowed from the School&lt;U+2019&gt;s library.51 He took various structural and ornamental solutions from nazar&lt;U+00ED&gt; and mud&lt;U+00E9&gt;jar art, which he used with variations and stylistic freedom in his works. A noteworthy observation that Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; made of Islamic art is the spatial uncertainty, the concept of structures with limitless space; taking on a feeling of sequence, fragmented, with holes and partitions, which create a divide without ruining the feeling of open space by closing it in with barriers.52
Undoubtedly the style that influenced him most strongly was the Gothic Revival, promoted in the latter half of the 19th century by the theoretical works of Viollet-le-Duc. The French architect called for studying the styles of the past and adapting them in a rational manner, taking into account both the structure and design.53 Nonetheless, for Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; the Gothic style was &quot;imperfect&quot;, because despite the effectiveness of some of its structural solutions it was an art that had yet to be &quot;perfected&lt;U+201D&gt;. In his own words:


The salamander in Park G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell has become a symbol of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s work.

After these initial influences, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; moved towards Modernisme, which was then in its heyday. Modernisme in its earlier stages was inspired by historic architecture, as for its practitioners the return to the past was a response to the industrial forms imposed by the new technological advances that the Industrial Revolution produced. The use of these styles from the past represented a moral regeneration that allowed the bourgeoisie to identify with values they regarded as their cultural roots. The Renaixen&lt;U+00E7&gt;a (rebirth), the revival of Catalan culture that began in the second half of the 19th century, brought more Gothic forms into the Catalan &lt;U+201C&gt;national&lt;U+201D&gt; style that aimed to combine nationalism and cosmopolitanism while at the same time integrating into the European modernizing movement.54
Some essential features of Modernisme were: an anticlassical language inherited from Romanticism with a tendency to a certain lyricism and subjectivity; the determined connection of architecture with the applied arts and artistic work that produced a remarkably ornamental style; the use of new materials from which emerged a mixed constructional language, rich in contrasts, that sought a plastic effect for the whole; a strong sense of optimism and faith in progress that produced an emphatic art that reflected the atmosphere of prosperity of the time, above all of the bourgeoisie.55
Quest for a new architectural language
 
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; is usually considered the great master of Catalan Modernism, but his works go beyond any style or classification. They are imaginative works that find their main inspiration in nature. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; studied organic and anarchic geometric forms of nature thoroughly, searching for a language to give expression to these forms in architecture. Some of his greatest inspirations came from the mountain of Montserrat, the caves of Mallorca, the saltpetre caves in Collbat&lt;U+00F3&gt;), the crag of Fra Guerau in the Prades Mountains behind Reus, the Pareis mountain in the north of Mallorca and Sant Miquel del Fai in Bigues i Riells, all of them places that Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; had visited.56
Geometrical forms
This study of nature translated into his use of ruled geometrical forms such as the hyperbolic paraboloid, the hyperboloid, the helicoid and the cone, which reflect the forms Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; would find in nature.57 Ruled surfaces are forms generated by a straight line known as the generatrix, as it moves over one or several lines known as directrices. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; found abundant examples of them in nature, for instance in rushes, reeds and bones; he used to say that there is no better structure than the trunk of a tree or a human skeleton. These forms are at the same time functional and aesthetic, and Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; would use them wisely, knowing how to adapt the language of nature to the structural forms of architecture. He used to assimilate the helicoid form to movement and the hyperboloid to light. Concerning ruled surfaces, he would say the following:

Another element widely used by Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was the catenary curve. He had studied geometry thoroughly when he was young, studying numerous articles about engineering, a field that praised the virtues of the catenary curve as a mechanical element, one which at that time, however, was used only in the construction suspension bridges. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was the first one to use this element in common architecture. The use of these catenary arches in works like the Casa Mil&lt;U+00E0&gt;, the School of the Teresianas, the crypt of the Col&lt;U+00F2&gt;nia G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell and the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia allowed Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; to add an element of great strength to his structures, given that the catenary distributes the weight it regularly carries evenly, being affected only by tangential forces that cancel each other out.58
With the use of these elements, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; went from plane to spatial geometry, to ruled geometry. These constructional forms are highly suited to the use of cheap materials such as brick. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; frequently used brick laid with mortar in successive layers, as in the traditional Catalan vault.59 This quest for new structural solutions culminated between 1910 and 1920, when he put all his research and experience into his masterpiece, the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; conceived this church as if it were the structure of a forest, with a set of tree-like columns divided into various branches to support a structure of intertwined hyperboloid vaults. He inclined the columns so they could put up better with the perpendicular pressures on their section. He also gave them a double turn helicoid shape (right turn and left turn), as in the branches and trunks of trees. This created a structure that is nowadays known as fractal.60 Together with a modulation of the space that divides it into small, independent and self-supporting modules, it creates a structure that perfectly supports the mechanical traction forces without need for buttresses, as required by the neo-Gothic style.61 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; thus achieved a rational, structured and perfectly logical solution adapted to nature, creating at the same time a new architectural style that was original, simple, practical and aesthetic.
Surpassing the Gothic
This new constructional technique allowed Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; to achieve his greatest architectural goal; to perfect and go beyond Gothic style. The hyperboloid vaults have their centre where the Gothic had their keystone, and the hyperboloid allows for a hole in this space to let natural light in. In the intersection between the vaults, where Gothic vaults have their ribs, the hyperboloid allows for holes as well, which Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; made use of to give the impression of a starry sky.62
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; complemented this organic vision of architecture with a unique spatial vision that allowed him to conceive his designs tridimensionally, unlike the dimensionally flat design of traditional architecture. He used to say that he had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced.63 Because of this spatial conception, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise on site as the works progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works, in fact only when required by authorities.

One of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s many innovations in the technical realm was the use of a scale model to calculate structures: for the church of the Col&lt;U+00F2&gt;nia G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell, he built a big scale model (1:10) with a height of four metres in a shed next to the building. There, he set up a model that had strings with little bags full of bullets hanging from them. On a drawing board that was attached to the ceiling he drew the floor of the church, and he hung the strings (for the catenaries) with the bullets (for the weight) from the supporting points of the building&lt;U+2014&gt;columns, intersection of walls. These weights produced a catenary curve both in the arches and vaults. At that point, he took a picture that, when inverted, showed the structure for columns and arches that Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; had been looking for. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; would then paint over these photographs with gouache or pastel. The outline of the church defined, he recorded every single detail of the building: architectural, stylistic and decorative.64
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s position in the history of architecture is that of a great creative genius who, inspired by nature, developed a style of his own that attained great technical perfection as well as a cultivated aesthetic value, and bore the mark of his strong character. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s structural innovations were to an extent the result of his journey through various styles, from Doric to Baroque via Gothic, his main source of inspiration. It could be said that these styles culminated in the work of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;, who reinterpreted and perfected them. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; passed through the historicism and eclecticism of his generation without connecting with other architectural movements of the 20th century that, with their rationalist postulates, derived from the Bauhaus school, and represented an antithetical evolution to that initiated by Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;, given that it later on marked the disdain and the initial lack of comprehension of the work of the modernista architect.
Other factors that led to the initial neglect of the Catalan architect's work was that despite having numerous assistants and helpers, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; did not create a school of his own and never taught, nor did he leave written documents. Some of his subordinates followed his footsteps closely, above all Francesc Berenguer and Josep Maria Jujol; others, like C&lt;U+00E8&gt;sar Martinell, Francesc Folguera and Josep Francesc R&lt;U+00E0&gt;fols graduated towards Noucentisme, leaving the master&lt;U+2019&gt;s trail.65 Despite this, a degree of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s influence can be discerned in some architects that either formed part of the Modernista movement or departed from it and who had had no direct contact with him, such as Josep Maria Pericas (Casa Al&lt;U+00F2&gt;s, Ripoll), Bernard&lt;U+00ED&gt; Martorell (Olius cemetery) and Llu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Muncunill (Mas&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Freixa, Terrassa). Nonetheless, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; left a deep mark on 20th century architecture: masters like Le Corbusier have declared themselves admirers, and the works of other architects like Pier Luigi Nervi, Friedensreich Hundertwasser, Oscar Niemeyer, F&lt;U+00E9&gt;lix Candela, Eduardo Torroja and Santiago Calatrava were inspired by Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;. Frei Otto used Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s forms in the construction of the Munich Olympic Stadium. In Japan, the work of Kenji Imai bears evidence of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s influence, as can be seen in the Memorial for the Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan in Nagasaki (Japanese National Architecture Award in 1962), where the use of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s famous &lt;U+201C&gt;trencad&lt;U+00ED&gt;s&quot; stands out.66
Design and craftsmanship

During his student days, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; attended craft workshops, such as those taught by Eudald Punt&lt;U+00ED&gt;, Lloren&lt;U+00E7&gt; Matamala and Joan O&lt;U+00F1&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;s, where he learned the basic aspects of all techniques relating to architecture, including sculpture, carpentry, wrought ironwork, stained glass, ceramics, plaster modelling, etc.67 He also took on new technological developments, integrating into his technique the use of iron and reinforced concrete in construction. All this is due to the global vision Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; had of architecture as a multifunctional design, in which every single detail in an arrangement has to be harmoniously made and well-proportioned. This knowledge allowed him to design architectural projects, including all the elements of his works, from furnishings to illumination to wrought ironwork.
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was also an innovator in the realm of craftsmanship, conceiving new technical and decorative solutions with his materials, for example his way of designing ceramic mosaics made of waste pieces (&lt;U+201C&gt;trencad&lt;U+00ED&gt;s&lt;U+201D&gt;) in original and imaginative combinations. For the restoration of Mallorca Cathedral he invented a new technique to produce stained glass, which consisted of juxtaposing three glass panes of primary colours, and sometimes a neutral one, varying the thickness of the glass in order to graduate the light's intensity.68
 This was how he personally designed many of the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia&lt;U+2019&gt;s sculptures, applying a method he had conceived. To start with, he would thoroughly study the anatomy of the figure, concentrating on gestures. For this purpose, he studied the human skeleton and sometimes used dummies made of wire to test the appropriate posture of the figure he was about to sculpt. In a second step, he would photograph his models, using a mirror system that provided multiple perspectives. He would then make plaster casts of the figures, both of people and animals (on one occasion he made a donkey stand up so it would not move). He would modify the proportions of these casts to obtain the figure's desired appearance, depending on its place in the church (the higher up, the bigger it would be). Eventually, he would sculpt the figures in stone.69
Urban spaces and landscaping
Apart from architecture Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; also practiced landscaping, often in urban settings. He aimed to place his works in the most appropriate natural and architectural surroundings by studying the location of his constructions thoroughly and trying to naturally integrate them into their surroundings. For this purpose, he often used the material that was most common in the nearby environment, such as the slate of Bellesguard and the grey Bierzo granite in the Bishop&lt;U+2019&gt;s Palace of Astorga. Many of his projects were gardens, such as the G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell Park and the Can Artigas Gardens, or they incorporated gardens, as in the Casa Vicens or the G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell Pavilions. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s harmonious approach to landscaping is exemplified at the First Mystery of the Glory of the Rosary at Montserrat, where the architectural framework is nature itself—here the Montserrat rock—that encircles the group of sculptures that adorned the path to the Holy Cave.
Interiors

Interior of the Casa Vicens

Equally, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; stood out as interior decorator, decorating most of his buildings personally, from the design of the furnishings to the smallest details. In each case he knew how to apply stylistic particularities, personalising the decoration according to the owner&lt;U+2019&gt;s taste, the predominant style of the arrangement or its place in the surroundings—whether urban or natural, secular or religious. Many of his works were related to liturgical furnishing. From the design of a desk for his office at the beginning of his career to the furnishings designed for the Sobrellano Palace of Comillas, he designed all furnishing of the Vicens, Calvet, Batll&lt;U+00F3&gt; and Mil&lt;U+00E0&gt; houses, of the G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell Palace and the Bellesguard Tower, and finally also the liturgical furnishing of the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia. It is noteworthy that Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; studied some ergonomy in order to adapt his furnishings to human anatomy. Many of his furnishings are exhibited at Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; Museum.70
Another aspect is the intelligent distribution of space, always with the aim of creating a comfortable, intimate interior atmosphere. For this purpose, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; would divide the space into sections, adapted to their specific use, by means of low walls, dropped ceilings, sliding doors and wall closets. Apart from taking care of every detail of all structural and ornamental elements, he would make sure his constructions had good lighting and ventilation. For this purpose, he would study the project's orientation with respect to the cardinal points, as well as the local climate and its place in its surroundings. At that time, there was an increasing demand for more domestic comfort, with piped water and gas and the use of electric light, all of which Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; expertly incorporated. For the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia, for example, he carried out thorough studies on acoustics and illumination, in order to optimise them. With regard to light, he stated:

Lighting also served Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; for the organisation of space, which required a careful study of the gradient of light intensity to adequately adapt to each specific environment. He achieved this with different elements such as skylights, windows, shutters and blinds; a notable case is the gradation of colour used in the atrium of the Casa Batll&lt;U+00F3&gt; to achieve uniform distribution of light throughout the interior. He also tended to build south-facing houses to maximise sunlight.71
Works

Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s work is normally classed as modernista, and it belongs to this movement because of its eagerness to renovate without breaking with tradition, its quest for modernity, the ornamental sense applied to works, and the multidisciplinary character of its undertakings, where craftsmanship plays a central role. To this, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; adds a dose of the baroque, adopts technical advances and continues to use traditional architectural language. Together with his inspiration from nature and the original touch of his works, this amalgam gives his works their personal and unique character in the history of architecture.
Chronologically, it is difficult to establish guidelines that illustrate the evolution of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s style faithfully. Although he moved on from his initially historicist approach to immerse himself completely in the modernista movement which arose so vigorously in the last third of the 19th century in Catalonia, before finally attaining his personal, organic style, this process did not consist of clearly-defined stages with obvious boundaries: rather, at every stage there are reflections of all the earlier ones, as he gradually assimilated and surpassed them. One of the best descriptions of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s work was made by his disciple and biographer Joan Berg&lt;U+00F3&gt;s, according to plastic and structural criteria. Berg&lt;U+00F3&gt;s establishes five periods in Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s productions: preliminary period, mud&lt;U+00E9&gt;jar-morisco (Moorish/mud&lt;U+00E9&gt;jar art), emulated Gothic, naturalist and expressionist, and organic synthesis.72
Early works
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;s first works both from his student days and the time just after his graduation stand out for the precision of their details, the use of geometry and the prevalence of mechanical considerations in the structural calculations.73
University years
During his studies, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; designed various projects, among which the following stand out: a cemetery gate (1875), a Spanish pavilion for the Philadelphia World Fair of 1876, a quay-side building (1876), a courtyard for the Diputaci&lt;U+00F3&gt; de Barcelona (1876), a monumental fountain for the Pla&lt;U+00E7&gt;a Catalunya in Barcelona (1877) and a university assembly hall (1877).74

Antoni Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; started his professional career while still at university. To pay for his studies , he worked as a draughtsman for some of the most outstanding Barcelona architects of the time, such as Joan Martorell, Josep Fontser&lt;U+00E8&gt;, Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano, Leandre Serrallach and Emili Sala Cort&lt;U+00E9&gt;s.75 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; had a long-standing relationship with Josep Fontser&lt;U+00E8&gt;, since his family was also from Riudoms and they had known each other for some time. Despite not having an architecture degree, Fontser&lt;U+00E8&gt; received the commission from the city council for the Parc de la Ciutadella development, carried out between 1873 and 1882. For this project, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was in charge of the design of the Park's entrance gate, the bandstand's balustrade and the water project for the monumental fountain, where he designed an artificial cave that showed his liking for nature and the organic touch he would give his architecture.76
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; worked for Francisco de Paula del Villar on the apse of the Montserrat monastery, designing the niche for the image of the Black Virgin of Montserrat in 1876. Later on, he would substitute Villar in the works of the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia. With Leandre Serrallach, he worked on a tram line project to Villa Arcadia in Montju&lt;U+00EF&gt;c. Eventually, he collaborated with Joan Martorell on the Jesuit church on Carrer Casp and the Salesian convent in Passeig de Sant Joan, as well as the Villaricos church (Almer&lt;U+00ED&gt;a). He also carried out a project for Martorell for the competition for a new facade for Barcelona cathedral, which was never accepted. His relationship with Martorell, whom he always considered one of his main and most influential masters, brought him unexpected luck; he later recommended Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; for the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia.
Early post-graduation projects
After his graduation as an architect in 1878, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s first work was a set of lampposts for the Pla&lt;U+00E7&gt;a Reial, the project for the Girossi newsstands and the Matar&lt;U+00F3&gt; cooperative, which was his first important work. He received the request from the city council of Barcelona in February 1878, when he had graduated but not yet received his degree, which was sent from Madrid on 15 March of the same year.77 For this commission he designed two types of lampposts: one with six arms, of which two were installed in the Pla&lt;U+00E7&gt;a Reial, and another with three, of which two were installed in the Pla del Palau, opposite the Civil Government. The lampposts were inaugurated during the Merc&lt;U+00E8&gt; festivities in 1879. Made of cast iron with a marble base, they have a decoration in which the caduceus of Mercury is prominent, symbol of commerce and emblem of Barcelona.

The Girossi newsstands project, which was never carried out, was a commission from the tradesman Enrique Girossi de Sanctis. It would have consisted of 20 newsstands, spread throughout Barcelona. Each of them would have included a public lavatory, a flower stand and glass panels for advertisements as well as a clock, a calendar, a barometer and a thermometer. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; conceived a structure with iron pillars and marble and glass slabs, crowned by a large iron and glass roof, with a gas illumination system.78
The Cooperativa Obrera Mataronense (Matar&lt;U+00F3&gt; Workers' Cooperative) was Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s first big project, on which he worked from 1878 to 1882, for Salvador Pag&lt;U+00E8&gt;s i Anglada. The project, for the cooperative&lt;U+2019&gt;s head office in Matar&lt;U+00F3&gt;, comprised a factory, a worker's housing estate, a social centre and a services building, though only the factory and the services building were completed. In the factory roof Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; used the catenary arch for the first time, with a bolt assembly system devised by Philibert de l'Orme.79 He also used ceramic tile decoration for the first time in the services building. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; laid out the site taking account of solar orientation, another signature of his works, and included landscaped areas. He even designed the Cooperative&lt;U+2019&gt;s banner, with the figure of a bee, symbol of industriousness.
In May 1878 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; designed a display cabinet for the Esteban Comella glove factory, which was exhibited in the Spanish pavilion at the Paris World Exhibition that year.80 It was this work that attracted the attention of the entrepreneur Eusebi G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell, visiting the French capital; he was so impressed that he wanted to meet Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; on his return, beginning a long friendship and professional collaboration. G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell became Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s main patron and sponsor of many of his large projects.
First G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell projects
G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell's first task for Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;, that same year, was the design of the furniture for the pantheon chapel of the Palacio de Sobrellano in Comillas, which was then being constructed by Joan Martorell, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s teacher, at the request of the Marquis of Comillas, G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell&lt;U+2019&gt;s father in law. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; designed a chair, a bench and a prayer stool: the chair was upholstered with velvet, finished with two eagles and the Marquis&lt;U+2019&gt; coat of arms; the bench stands out with the motif of a dragon, designed by Lloren&lt;U+00E7&gt; Matamala; the prayer stool is decorated with plants.
Also in 1878 he drew up the plans for a theatre in the former town of Sant Gervasi de Cassoles (now a district of Barcelona); Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; did not take part in the construction of the theatre, which no longer exists. The following year he designed the furniture and counter for the Gibert Pharmacy, with marquetry of Arab influence. The same year he made five drawings for a procession in honour of the poet Francesc Vicent Garcia i Torres in Vallfogona de Riucorb, where this celebrated 17th-century writer and friend of Lope de Vega was the parish priest . Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s project was centred on the poet and on several aspects of agricultural work, such as reaping and harvesting grapes and olives; however, as a result of organisational problems Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s ideas were not carried out.81
Between 1879 and 1881 he drew up a proposal for the decoration of the church of Sant Paci&lt;U+00E0&gt;, belonging to the Colegio de Jes&lt;U+00FA&gt;s-Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a in Sant Andreu del Palomar: he created the altar in a Gothic style, the monstrance with Byzantine influence, the mosaics and the lighting, as well as the school&lt;U+2019&gt;s furniture. The church caught fire during the Tragic Week of 1909, and now only the mosaics remain, of &lt;U+201C&gt;opus tesselatum&lt;U+201D&gt;, probably the work of the Italian mosaicist Luigi Pellerin.82 He was given the task of decorating the church of the Colegio de Jes&lt;U+00FA&gt;s-Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a in Tarragona (1880–1882): he created the altar in white Italian marble, and its front part, or antependium, with four columns bearing medallions of polychrome alabaster, with figures of angels; the ostensory with gilt wood, the work of Eudald Punt&lt;U+00ED&gt;, decorated with rosaries, angels, tetramorph symbols and the dove of the Holy Ghost; and the choir stalls, which were destroyed in 1936.83
In 1880 he designed an electric lighting project for Barcelona&lt;U+2019&gt;s Muralla de Mar, or seawall, which finally was not carried out. It consisted of eight large iron street lamps, profusely decorated with plant motifs, friezes, shields and names of battles and Catalan admirals. The same year he participated in the competition for the construction of the San Sebasti&lt;U+00E1&gt;n social centre (now town hall), won by Luis Aladr&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Mendivi and Adolfo Morales de los R&lt;U+00ED&gt;os; Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; submitted a project that synthesised several of his earlier studies, such as the fountain for the Pla&lt;U+00E7&gt;a Catalunya and the courtyard of the Provincial Council.84
Collaboration with Martorell
 A new task of the G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell-L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez&lt;U+2019&gt;s for Comillas was the gazebo for Alfonso XII&lt;U+2019&gt;s visit to the Cantabrian town in 1881. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; designed a small pavilion in the shape of a Hindu turban, covered in mosaics and decorated with an abundance of small bells which jingled constantly. It was subsequently moved into the G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell Pavilions.85
In 1882 he designed a Benedictine monastery and a church dedicated to the Holy Spirit in Villaricos (Cuevas de Vera, Almeria) for his former teacher, Joan Martorell. It was of neo-Gothic design, similar to the Convent of the Salesians that Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; also planned with Martorell. Ultimately it was not carried out, and the project plans were destroyed in the looting of the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia in 1936.86 The same year he was tasked with constructing a hunting lodge and wine cellars at a country residence known as La Cuadra, in Garraf (Sitges), property of baron Eusebi G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell. Ultimately the wine cellars but not the lodge, were built some years later. With Martorell he also collaborated on three other projects: the church of the Jesuit School in Carrer Caspe; the Convent of the Salesians in Passeig de Sant Joan, a neo-Gothic project with an altar in the centre of the crossing; and the facade project for Barcelona cathedral, for the competition convened by the cathedral chapter in 1882, ultimately won by Josep Oriol Mestres and August Font i Carreras.87
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s collaboration with Martorell was a determining factor in Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s recommendation for the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia. The church was the idea of Josep Maria Bocabella, founder of the Devotees of Saint Joseph Association, which acquired a complete block of Barcelona&lt;U+2019&gt;s Eixample district.88 The project was originally entrusted to Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano, who planned the construction of a neo-Gothic church, on which work began in 1882. However, the following year Villar resigned due to disagreements with the construction board, and the task went to Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;, who completely redesigned the project, apart from the part of the crypt that had already been built.89 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; devoted the rest of his life to the construction of the church, which was to be the synthesis of all of his architectural discoveries.
Orientalist period
During these years Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; completed a series of works with a distinctly oriental flavour, inspired by the art of the Middle and Far East (India, Persia, Japan), as well as Islamic-Hispanic art, mainly Mudejar and Nazari. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; used ceramic tile decoration abundantly, as well as Moorish arches, columns of exposed brick and pinnacles in the shape of pavilions or domes.90
Between 1883 and 1888 he constructed the Casa Vicens, commissioned by stockbroker Manuel Vicens i Montaner. It was constructed with four floors, with facades on three sides and an extensive garden, including a monumental brick fountain. The house was surrounded by a wall with iron gates, decorated with palmetto leaves, work of Lloren&lt;U+00E7&gt; Matamala. The walls of the house are of stone alternated with lines of tile, which imitate yellow flowers typical of this area; the house is topped with chimneys and turrets. In the interior the polychrome wooden roof beams stand out, adorned with floral themes of papier mach&lt;U+00E9&gt;; the walls are decorated with vegetable motifs, as well as paintings by Josep Torrescasana; finally, the floor consists of Roman-style mosaics of &quot;opus tesselatum&quot;. One of the most original rooms is the smoking room, notable the ceiling, decorated with Moorish honeycomb-work, reminiscent of the Generalife in the Alhambra in Granada.91

Casa Vicens (1883-88)



In the same year, 1883, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; designed the Sant&lt;U+00ED&gt;simo Sacramento chapel for the parish church of San F&lt;U+00E9&gt;lix de Alella, as well as some topographical plans for the Can Rosell de la Llena country residence in Gelida. He also received a commission to build a small annex to the Palacio de Sobrellano, for the Baron of Comillas, in the Cantabrian town of the same name. Known as El Capricho, it was commissioned by M&lt;U+00E1&gt;ximo D&lt;U+00ED&gt;az de Quijano and constructed between 1883 and 1885. Crist&lt;U+00F2&gt;for Cascante i Colom, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s fellow student, directed the construction. In an oriental style, it has an elongated shape, on three levels and a cylindrical tower in the shape of a Persian minaret, faced completely in ceramics. The entrance is set behind four columns supporting depressed arches, with capitals decorated with birds and leaves, similar to those that can be seen at the Casa Vicens. Notable are the main lounge, with its large sash window, and the smoking room with a ceiling consisting of a false Arab-style stucco vault.92
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; carried out a second commission from Eusebi G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell between 1884 and 1887, the G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell Pavilions in Pedralbes, now on the outskirts of Barcelona. G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell had a country residence in Les Corts de Sarri&lt;U+00E0&gt;, consisting of two adjacent properties known as Can Feliu and Can Cuy&lt;U+00E0&gt;s de la Riera. The architect Joan Martorell had built a Caribbean-style mansion, which was demolished in 1919 to make way for the Royal Palace of Pedralbes. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; undertook to refurbish the house and construct a wall and porter's lodge. He completed the stone wall with several entrances, the main entrance with an iron gate in the shape of a dragon, with symbology allusive to the myths of Hercules and the Garden of the Hesperides.93 The buildings consist of a stable, covered longeing ring and porter's lodge: the stable has a rectangular base and catenary arches; the longeing ring has a square base with a hyperboloid dome; the porter's lodge consists of three small buildings, the central one being polygonal with a hyperbolic dome, and the other two smaller and cubic. All three are topped by ventilators in the shape of chimneys faced with ceramics. The walls are of exposed brick in various shades of reds and yellows ; in certain sections prefabricated cement blocks are also used. The Pavilions are now the headquarters of the Real C&lt;U+00E1&gt;tedra Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;, of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia.
In 1885 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; accepted a commission from Josep Maria Bocabella, promotor of the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia, for an altar in the oratory of the Bocabella family, who had obtained permission from the Pope to have an altar in their home. The altar is made of varnished mahogany, with a slab of white marble in the centre for relics. It is decorated with plants and religious motifs, such as the Greek letters alpha and omega, symbol of the beginning and end, gospel phrases and images of Saint Francis of Paola, Saint Teresa of Avila and the Holy Family and closed with a curtain of crimson embroidery. It was made by the cabinet maker Frederic Lab&lt;U+00F2&gt;ria, who also collaborated with Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; on the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia.94
Shortly after, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; received an important new commission from G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell: the construction of his family house, in the Carrer Nou de la Rambla in Barcelona. The Palau G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell (1886–1888) continues the tradition of large Catalan urban mansions such as those in Carrer Montcada. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; designed a monumental entrance with a magnificent parabolic arch above iron gates, decorated with the Catalan coat of arms and a helmet with a winged dragon, the work of Joan O&lt;U+00F1&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;s. A notable feature is the triple-height entrance hall; it is the core of the building, surrounded by the main rooms of the palace, and it is remarkable for its double dome, parabolic within and conical on the outside, a solution typical of Byzantine art. For the gallery on the street facade Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; used an original system of catenary arches and columns with hyperbolic capitals, a style he used only here.95 He designed the interior of the palace with great care, with a sumptuous Mudejar-style decoration, where the wood and iron coffered ceilings stand out. The chimneys on the roof are a highly remarkable feature, faced in vividly-coloured ceramic tiles, as is the tall spire in the form of a lantern tower, which is the external termination of the dome within, and is also faced with ceramic tiles and topped with an iron weather vane.96
On the occasion of the World Expo held in Barcelona in 1888, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; constructed the pavilion for the Compa&lt;U+00F1&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Trasatl&lt;U+00E1&gt;ntica, property of the Marquis of Comillas, in the Maritime Section of the event. He created it in a Granadinian Nazari style, with horseshoe arches and stucco decoration; the building survived until the Passeig Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;tim was opened up in 1960. In the wake of the event he received a commission from Barcelona Council to restore the Sal&lt;U+00F3&gt; de Cent and the grand stairs in Barcelona City Hall, as well as a chair for the queen Maria Cristina; only the chair was made, and Mayor Francesc Rius i Taulet presented it to the Queen.97
Neo-Gothic period
During this period Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was inspired above all by mediaeval Gothic art, but wanted to improve on its structural solutions. Neo-gothic was one of the most successful historicist styles at that time, above all as a result of the theoretical studies of Viollet-le-Duc.98 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; studied examples in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and Roussillon in depth, as well as Leonese and Castillian buildings during his stays in Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n and Burgos, and became convinced that it was an imperfect style, leaving major structural issues only partly resolved. In his works he eliminated the need of buttresses through the use of ruled surfaces, and abolished crenellations and excessive openwork.99



Orientalist works





Teresianas01.jpg



Colegio de las Teresianas



The first example was the Colegio de las Teresianas (1888–1889), in Barcelona&lt;U+2019&gt;s Carrer Ganduxer, commissioned by San Enrique de Oss&lt;U+00F3&gt;. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; fulfilled the wish of the order that the building should be austere, in keeping with their vows of poverty. He designed a simple building, using bricks for the exterior and some brick elements for the interior. Wrought ironwork, one of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s favourite materials, appeared on the facades. The building is crowned by a row of merlons which suggest a castle, a possible reference to Saint Teresa&lt;U+2019&gt;s Interior Castle.100 The corners have brick pinnacles topped by helicoidal columns and culminate in a four-armed cross, typical of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s works, and with ceramic shields bearing various symbols of the order. The interior includes a corridor which is famous for the series of catenary arches that it contains. These elegant arches are decorative and support the ceiling and the floor above. For Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;, the parabolic arch was an ideal constructional element, capable of supporting great loads with slender masonry.101
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; received his next commission from a clergyman who had been a boyhood friend in his native Reus. When he was appointed bishop of Astorga, Joan Baptista Grau i Vallespin&lt;U+00F3&gt;s asked Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; to design a new episcopal palace for the city, as the previous building had caught fire. Constructed between 1889 and 1915, in a neo-Gothic style with four cylindrical towers, it was surrounded by a moat. The stone with which it was built (grey granite from the El Bierzo area) is in harmony with its surroundings, particularly with the cathedral in its immediate vicinity, as well as with the natural landscape, which in late 19th-century Astorga was more visible than today. The porch has three large flared arches, built of ashlar and separated by sloping buttresses. The structure is supported by columns with decorated capitals and by ribbed vaults on pointed arches, and topped with Mudejar-style merlons. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; resigned from the project in 1893, at the death of Bishop Grau, due to disagreements with the Chapter, and it was finished in 1915 by Ricardo Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Guereta. It currently houses a museum about the Way of Saint James, which passes through Astorga102
Another of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s projects outside of Catalonia was the Casa de los Botines, in Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n (1891–1894), commissioned by Sim&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Fern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez Fern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez and Mariano Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt;s Luna, textile merchants from Leon, who were recommended Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; by Eusebi G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell, with whom they did business. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s project was an impressive neo-Gothic style building, which bears his unmistakable modernista imprint. The building was used to accommodate offices and textile shops on the lower floors, as well as apartments on the upper floors. It was constructed with walls of solid limestone.103 The building is flanked by four cylindrical turrets surmounted by slate spires, and surrounded by an area with an iron grille. The Gothic facade style, with its cusped arches, has a clock and a sculpture of Saint George and the Dragon, the work of Lloren&lt;U+00E7&gt; Matamala.104 As of 2010 it was the headquarters of the Caja Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;a.
In 1892 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was commissioned by Claudio L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez Bru, second Marquis of Comillas, with the Franciscana Catholic Missions for the city of Tangier, in Morocco (at the time a Spanish colony). The project included a church, hospital and school, and Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; conceived a quadrilobulate ground-plan floor structure, with catenary arches, parabolic towers, and hyperboloid windows. Ultimately the project was not carried out, something Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; deeply regretted, always keeping his design with him. In spite of this, the project influenced the works of the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia, in particular the design of the towers, with their paraboloid shape like those of the Missions.105  In 1895 he designed a funerary chapel for the G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell family at the abbey of Montserrat, but little is known about this work, which was never built. That year, construction finally began on the Bodegas G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell, the 1882 project for a hunting lodge and some wineries at La Cuadra de Garraf (Sitges), property of Eusebi G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell. Constructed between 1895 and 1897 under the direction of Francesc Berenguer, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s aide, the wineries have a triangular end facade, a very steep stone roof, a group of chimneys and two bridges that join them to an older building. It has three floors: the bottom one for a garage, an apartment and a chapel with catenary arches, with the altar in the centre. It was completed with a porter&lt;U+2019&gt;s lodge, notable for the iron gate in the shape of a fishing net.
In the township of Sant Gervasi de Cassoles (now a district of Barcelona), Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was given a commission by the widow of Jaume Figueras to renovate the Torre Bellesguard (1900–1909), former summer palace of King Martin I the Humane.106 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; designed it in a neo-Gothic style, respecting the former building as much as possible, and tried as always to integrate the architecture into the natural surroundings. This influenced his choice of local slate for the construction. The building's ground-plan measures 15 x 15 meters, with the corners oriented to the four cardinal points. Constructed in stone and brick, it is taller than it is wide, with a spire topped with the four-armed cross, the Catalan flag and the royal crown. The house has a basement, ground floor, first floor and an attic, with a gable roof.107
Naturalist period
During this period Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; perfected his personal style, inspired by the organic shapes of nature, putting into practise a whole series of new structural solutions originating from his deep analysis of ruled geometry. To this he added a great creative freedom and an imaginative ornamental style. His works acquired a great structural richness, with shapes and volumes devoid of rational rigidity or any classic premise.108
1898-1900
Commissioned by the company Hijos de Pedro M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rtir Calvet, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; built the Casa Calvet (1898–1899), in Barcelona&lt;U+2019&gt;s Carrer Casp. The facade is built of Montju&lt;U+00EF&gt;c stone, adorned with wrought iron balconies and topped with two pediments with wrought iron crosses. Another notable feature of the facade is the gallery on the main floor, decorated with plant and mythological motifs. For this project Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; used a Baroque style, visible in the use of Solomonic columns, decoration with floral themes and the design of the terraced roof . In 1900 he won the award for the best building of the year from Barcelona City Council.109
A virtually unknown work by Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; is the Casa Clap&lt;U+00E9&gt;s (1899–1900), at 125 Carrer Escorial, commissioned by the painter Aleix Clap&lt;U+00E9&gt;s, who collaborated on occasion with Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;, such as in decorating the Palau G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell and the Casa Mil&lt;U+00E0&gt;. It has a ground floor and three apartments, with stuccoed walls and cast-iron balconies. Due to its lack of decoration or original structural solutions its authorship was unknown until 1976, when the architect&lt;U+2019&gt;s plans signed by Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; were discovered.110 In 1900 he renovated the house of Dr. Pere Santal&lt;U+00F3&gt;, at 32 Carrer Nou de la Rambla, a work of equally low importance. Santal&lt;U+00F3&gt; was a friend of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s, whom he accompanied during his stay in Puigcerd&lt;U+00E0&gt; in 1911.It was he who recommended him to do manual work for his rheumatism.111

Also in 1900 he designed two banners: for the Orfe&lt;U+00F3&gt; Feliu&lt;U+00E0&gt; (of Sant Feliu de Codines), made of brass, leather, cork and silk, with ornamental motifs based on the martyrdom of San F&lt;U+00E9&gt;lix (a millstone), music (a staff and clef) and the inscription &lt;U+201C&gt;Orfe&lt;U+00F3&gt; Feliu&lt;U+00E0&gt;&lt;U+201D&gt;; and Our Lady of Mercy of Reus, for the pilgrimage of the Reus residents of Barcelona, with an image of Isabel Besora, the shepherdess to whom the Virgin appeared in 1592, work of Aleix Clap&lt;U+00E9&gt;s and, on the back, a rose and the Catalan flag. In the same year, for the shrine of Our Lady of Mercy in Reus, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; outlined a project for the renovation of the church&lt;U+2019&gt;s main facade, which ultimately was not undertaken, as the board considered it too expensive. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; took this rejection quite badly, leaving some bitterness towards Reus, possibly the source of his subsequent claim that Riudoms was his place of birth.112 Between 1900 and 1902 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; worked on the Casa Miralles, commissioned by the industrialist Hermenegild Miralles i Angl&lt;U+00E8&gt;s; Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; designed only the wall near the gateway, of undulating masonry, with an iron gate topped with the four-armed cross. Subsequently, the house for Se&lt;U+00F1&gt;or Miralles was designed by Dom&lt;U+00E8&gt;nec Sugra&lt;U+00F1&gt;es, associate architect of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;.
Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s main new project at the beginning of the 20th century was the Park G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell (1900–1914), commissioned by Eusebi G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell. It was intended to be a residential estate in the style of an English garden city. The project was unsuccessful: of the 60 plots into which the site was divided only one was sold. Despite this, the park entrances and service areas were built, displaying Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s architectural genius and putting into practise many of his innovative structural solutions. The Park G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell is situated in Barcelona&lt;U+2019&gt;s C&lt;U+00E0&gt;rmel district, a rugged area, with steep slopes that Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; negotiated with a system of viaducts integrated into the terrain. The main entrance to the park has a building on each side, intended as a porter&lt;U+2019&gt;s lodge and an office, and the site is surrounded by a stone and glazed-ceramic wall. These entrance buildings are an example of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; at the height of his powers, with Catalan vaults that form a parabolic hyperboloid.113 After passing through the gate, steps lead to higher levels, decorated with sculpted fountains, notably the dragon fountain, which has become a symbol of the park and one of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s most recognised emblems. These steps lead to the Hypostyle Hall, which was to have been the residents&lt;U+2019&gt; market, constructed with large Doric columns. Above this chamber is a large plaza in the form of a Greek theatre, with the famous undulating bench covered in broken ceramics (&quot;trencad&lt;U+00ED&gt;s&quot;), the work of Josep Maria Jujol.114 The park&lt;U+2019&gt;s show home, the work of Francesc Berenguer, was Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s residence from 1906 to 1926, and currently houses the Casa-Museu Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;.
During this period Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; contributed to a group project, the Rosary of Montserrat (1900&lt;U+2013&gt;1916). Located on the way to the Holy Cave of Montserrat, it was a series of groups of sculptures that evoked the mysteries of the Virgin, who tells the rosary. This project involved the best architects and sculptors of the era, and is a curious example of Catalan Modernism. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; designed the First Mystery of Glory, which represents the Holy Sepulcher. The series include a statue of Christ Risen, the work of Josep Llimona, and the Three Marys sculpted by Dion&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Renart. Another monumental project designed by Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; for Montserrat was never carried out: it would have included crowning the summit of El Cavall Bernat (one of the mountain peaks) with a viewpoint in the shape of a royal crown, incorporating a  high Catalan coat of arms into the wall.115
1901&lt;U+2013&gt;1903
In 1901 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; decorated the house of Isabel G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez, Marchioness of Castelldosrius, and daughter of Eusebi G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell. Situated at 19 Carrer Junta de Comer&lt;U+00E7&gt;, the house had been built in 1885 and renovated between 1901 and 1904; it was destroyed by a bomb during the Civil War.116 The following year Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; took part in the decoration of the Bar Torino, property of Flaminio Mezzalana, located at 18 Passeig de Gr&lt;U+00E0&gt;cia; Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; designed the ornamentation of el Sal&lt;U+00F3&gt;n &lt;U+00C1&gt;rabe of that establishment, made with varnished Arabian-style cardboard tiles (which no longer exist).
A project of great interest to Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was the restoration of the Cathedral of Santa Maria in Palma de Mallorca (1903–1914), commissioned by the city&lt;U+2019&gt;s bishop, Pere Campins i Barcel&lt;U+00F3&gt;. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; planned a series of works including removing the baroque altarpiece, revealing the bishop's throne, moving the choir-stalls from the centre of the nave and placing them in the presbytery, clearing the way through chapel of the Holy Trinity, placing new pulpits, fitting the cathedral with electrical lighting, uncovering the Gothic windows of the Royal Chapel and filling them with stained glass, placing a large canopy above the main altar and completing the decoration with paintings. This was coordinated by Joan Rubi&lt;U+00F3&gt; i Bellver, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s assistant. Josep Maria Jujol and the painters Joaqu&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Torres Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a, Iu Pascual and Jaume Llongueras were also involved. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; abandoned the project in 1914 due to disagreements with the Cathedral chapter.117
1904
 One of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s largest and most striking works is the Casa Batll&lt;U+00F3&gt; (1904–1906). Commissioned by Josep Batll&lt;U+00F3&gt; i Casanovas to renovate an existing building erected in 1875 by Emili Sala Cort&lt;U+00E9&gt;s,118 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; focused on the facade, the main floor, the patio and the roof, and built a fifth floor for the staff. For this project he was assisted by his aides Dom&lt;U+00E8&gt;nec Sugra&lt;U+00F1&gt;es, Joan Rubi&lt;U+00F3&gt; and Josep Canaleta. The facade is of Montju&lt;U+00EF&gt;c sandstone cut to create warped ruled surfaces; the columns are bone-shaped with vegetable decoration. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; kept the rectangular shape of the old building&lt;U+2019&gt;s balconies&lt;U+2014&gt;with iron railings in the shape of masks&lt;U+2014&gt;giving the rest of the facade an ascending undulating form. He also faced the facade with ceramic fragments of various colours (&quot;trencad&lt;U+00ED&gt;s&quot;), which Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; obtained from the waste material of the Pelegr&lt;U+00ED&gt; glass works. The interior courtyard is roofed by a skylight supported by an iron structure in the shape of a double T, which rests on a series of catenary aches. The helicoidal chimneys are a notable feature of the roof, topped with conical caps, covered in clear glass in the centre and ceramics at the top, and surmounted by clear glass balls filled with sand of different colours. The facade culminates in catenary vaults covered with two layers of brick and faced with glazed ceramic tiles in the form of scales (in shades of yellow, green and blue), which resemble a dragon&lt;U+2019&gt;s back; on the left side is a cylindrical turret with anagrams of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, and with Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s four-armed cross.119
In 1904, commissioned by the painter Llu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Graner i Arruf&lt;U+00ED&gt;, he designed the decoration of the Sala Merc&lt;U+00E8&gt;, in the Rambla dels Estudis, one of the first cinemas in Barcelona; the theatre imitated a cave, inspired by the Coves del del Drac (Dragon's Caves) in Mallorca. Also for Graner he designed a detached house in the Bonanova district of Barcelona, of which only the foundations and the main gate were built, with three openings: for people, vehicles and birds; the building would have had a structure similar to the Casa Batll&lt;U+00F3&gt; or the porter's lodge of the Park G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell.120
 The same year he built a workshop, the Taller Badia, for Josep and Llu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Badia Miarnau, blacksmiths who worked for Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; on several of his works, such as the Batll&lt;U+00F3&gt; and Mil&lt;U+00E0&gt; houses, the Park G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell and and the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia. Located at 278 Carrer N&lt;U+00E0&gt;pols, it was a simple stone building. Around that time he also designed hexagonal hydraulic floor tiles for the Casa Batll&lt;U+00F3&gt;, they were eventually used instead for the Casa Mil&lt;U+00E0&gt;; they were a green colour and were decorated with seaweed, shells and starfish. These tiles were subsequently chosen to pave Barcelona&lt;U+2019&gt;s Passeig de Gr&lt;U+00E0&gt;cia.121
Also in 1904 he built the Chalet de Catllar&lt;U+00E0&gt;s, in La Pobla de Lillet, for the Asland cement factory, owned by Eusebi G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell. It has a simple structure though very original, in the shape of a pointed arch, with two semi-circular flights of stairs leading to the top two floors. This building fell into ruin when the cement works closed, and when it was eventually restored its appearance was radically altered, the ingenious original staircase being replaced with a simpler metal one. In the same area he created the Can Artigas Gardens between 1905 and 1907, in an area called Font de la Magnesia, commissioned by the textile merchant Joan Artigas i Alart; men who had worked the Park G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell were also involved on this project, similar to the famous park in Barcelona.122
1906
 In 1906 he designed a bridge over the Torrent de Pomeret, between Sarri&lt;U+00E0&gt; and Sant Gervasi. This river flowed directly between two of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s works, Bellesguard and the Chalet Graner, and so he was asked to bridge the divide. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; designed an interesting structure composed of juxtaposed triangles that would support the bridge&lt;U+2019&gt;s framework, following the style of the viaducts that he made for the Park G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell. It would have been built with cement, and would have had a length of  and a height of ; the balustrade would have been covered with glazed tiles, with an inscription dedicated to Santa Eul&lt;U+00E0&gt;lia. The project was not approved by the Town Council of Sarri&lt;U+00E0&gt;.123
The same year Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; apparently took part in the construction of the Torre Dami&lt;U+00E0&gt; Mateu, in Llinars del Vall&lt;U+00E8&gt;s, in collaboration with his disciple Francesc Berenguer, though the project&lt;U+2019&gt;s authorship is not clear or to what extent they each contributed to it. The style of the building evokes Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s early work, such as the Casa Vicens or the G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell Pavilions; it had an entrance gate in the shape of a fishing net, currently installed in the Park G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell. The building was demolished in 1939.124 Also in 1906 he designed a new banner, this time for the Guild of Metalworkers and Blacksmiths for the Corpus Christi procession of 1910, in Barcelona Cathedral. It was dark green in colour, with Barcelona&lt;U+2019&gt;s coat of arms in the upper left corner, and an image of Saint Eligius, patron of the guild, with typical tools of the trade. The banner was burned in July 1936.125

Casa Mil&lt;U+00E0&gt;

Another of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s major projects and one of his most admired works is the Casa Mil&lt;U+00E0&gt;, better known as La Pedrera (1906–1910), commissioned by Pere Mil&lt;U+00E0&gt; i Camps. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; designed the house around two large, curved courtyards, with a structure of stone, brick and cast-iron columns and steel beams. The facade is built of limestone from Vilafranca del Pened&lt;U+00E8&gt;s, apart from the upper level, which is covered in white tiles, evoking a snowy mountain. It has a total of five floors, plus a loft made entirely of catenary arches, as well as two large interior courtyards, one circular and one oval. Notable features are the staircases to the roof, topped with the four-armed cross, and the chimneys, covered in ceramics and with shapes that suggest mediaeval helmets. The interior decoration was carried out by Josep Maria Jujol and the painters Iu Pascual, Xavier Nogu&lt;U+00E9&gt;s and Aleix Clap&lt;U+00E9&gt;s. The facade was to have been completed with a stone, metal and glass sculpture with Our lady of the Rosary accompanied by the archangels Michael and Gabriel, 4m in height. A sketch was made by the sculptor Carles Mani, but due to the events of the Tragic Week in 1909 the project was abandoned.126
1907–8
 In 1907, to mark the seventh centenary of the birth of King James I, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; designed a monument in his memory. It would have been situated in the Pla&lt;U+00E7&gt;a del Rei, and would have also meant the renovation of the adjacent buildings: new roof for the cathedral, as well as the completion of its towers and cupola; placement of three vases above the buttresses of the Chapel of Santa &lt;U+00C0&gt;gada, dedicated to the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary, as well as the figure of an angel on top of the chapel's tower; finally, the opening of a large square next to the walls (now the Pla&lt;U+00E7&gt;a Ramon Berenguer el Grand). The project was not executed because the city council disliked it.127
In 1908 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; devised a project for a skyscraper hotel in New York, the Hotel Attraction, commissioned by two American entrepreneurs whose names are unknown. It would have been  high (taller than the Empire State Building), with a taller parabolic central section, topped with a star, and flanked by four volumes containing museums, art galleries and concert halls, with shapes similar to the Casa Mil&lt;U+00E0&gt;. Inside it would have had five large rooms, one dedicated to every continent.128

Original design of the church for the Col&lt;U+00F2&gt;nia G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell

The final project for his great patron Eusebi G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell was the church for the Col&lt;U+00F2&gt;nia G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell, an industrial village in Santa Coloma de Cervell&lt;U+00F3&gt;, of which only the crypt was constructed (known today as Crypt of the Col&lt;U+00F2&gt;nia G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell) (1908–1918). The project began in 1890, and the factory, service buildings and housing for the workers were constructed. What would have been the colony&lt;U+2019&gt;s church was designed by Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; in 1898, though the first stone was not laid until 4 October 1908. Unfortunately only the crypt was built, as G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell&lt;U+2019&gt;s sons abandoned the project after his death in 1918. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; designed an oval church with five aisles, one central aisle and two at either side. He conceived it as fully integrated into nature. A porch of hyperbolic paraboloid vaults precedes the crypt, the first time that Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; used this structure and notably the first use of paraboloid vaults in the history of architecture.129 In the crypt the large hyperboloid stained glass windows stand out, with the shapes of flower petals and butterfly wings. Inside, circular brick pillars alternate with slanted basalt columns from Castellfollit de la Roca.
Final period
 During the last years of his career, dedicated almost exclusively to la Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; reached the culmination of this naturalistic style, creating a synthesis of all of the solutions and styles he had tried until then. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; achieved perfect harmony between structural and ornamental elements, between plastic and aesthetic, between function and form, between container and content, achieving the integration of all arts in one structured, logical work.130
The first example of his final stage can be seen in a simple but very ingenious building, the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia schools, a small school for the workers&lt;U+2019&gt; children. Built in 1909, it has a rectangular ground plan of , and contained three classrooms, a vestibule and a chapel. It was built of exposed brick, in three overlapping layers, following the traditional Catalan method. The walls and roof have an undulating shape, giving the structure a sense of lightness but also strength. The Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia schools have set an example of constructive genius and have served as a source of inspiration for many architects, such is their simplicity, strength, originality, functionality and geometric excellence.131
In May 1910 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; paid a short visit to Vic, where he was tasked to design the lampposts for the city&lt;U+2019&gt;s Pla&lt;U+00E7&gt;a Major, in commemoration of the first centenary of the birth of Jaume Balmes. They were obelisk-shaped lamps, with basalt rock bases from Castellfollit de la Roca and wrought iron arms, topped with the four-armed cross; they were decorated with vegetable themes and included the birth and death dates of Balmes. They were demolished in 1924 due to poor maintenance.132
The same year, on the occasion of Eusebi G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell's obtaining the title of count, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; designed a coat of arms for his patron. He devised a shield with the lower part in a catenary shape typical of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;. He divided it into two parts: the lantern of Palau G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell features a dove and a gear-wheel on the right in allusion to the Col&lt;U+00F2&gt;nia G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell in Santa Coloma de Cervell&lt;U+00F3&gt; (coloma is Catalan for dove), with the phrase ahir pastor (yesterday Shepherd). On the left is an owl perched on a half-moon—symbol of prudence and wisdom—with the words avuy senyor (today Lord). The shield is surmounted by a helmet with the count's coronet and the dove symbol of the Holy Spirit.133
In 1912 he built two pulpits for the church of Santa Maria in Blanes: the pulpit on the Gospel side had a hexagonal base, decorated with the dove of the Holy Spirit and the names in Latin of the four evangelists and the seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit; the pulpit of the Epistle side had the names of the apostles who wrote epistles (Saint Peter, Saint Paul, Saint John the Evangelist, Saint Judas Thadeus and Saint James the Great), with the three theological virtues and the flames of Pentecost. These pulpits were burned in July 1936.134
Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia
 From 1915 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; devoted himself almost exclusively to his magnum opus, the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia, a synthesis of his architectural evolution. After completion of the crypt and the apse, still in Gothic style, the rest of the church is conceived in an organic style, imitating natural shapes with their abundance of ruled surfaces. The interior is intended to resemble a forest, with inclined columns like branching trees, helicoidal in form, creating a simple but sturdy structure. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; applied all of his previous experimental findings in this project, from works such as the Park G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell and the crypt of the Col&lt;U+00F2&gt;nia G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell, creating a church that is at once structurally perfect, harmonious and aesthetically satisfying.
The Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia has a cruciform plan, with a five-aisled nave, a transept of three aisles, and an apse with seven chapels. It has three facades dedicated to the birth, passion and glory of Jesus, and when completed it will have eighteen towers: four at each side making a total of twelve for the apostles, four on the transept invoking the evangelists and one on the apse dedicated to the Virgin, plus the central tower in honour of Jesus, which will reach  in height.135 The church will have two sacristies adjacent to the apse, and three large chapels: one for the Assumption in the apse, and the Baptism and Penitence chapels at the west end; also, it will be surrounded by a cloister designed for processions and to isolate the building from the exterior. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; used highly symbolic content in the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia, both in architecture and sculpture, dedicating each part of the church to a religious theme.
During Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s life only the crypt, apse and part of the Nativity facade were completed. Upon his death his assistant Dom&lt;U+00E8&gt;nec Sugra&lt;U+00F1&gt;es took over the construction; thereafter it was directed by various architects. Jordi Bonet i Armengol assumed responsibility in 1987 and continued as of 2011. Artists such as Lloren&lt;U+00E7&gt; and Joan Matamala, Carles Mani, Jaume Busquets, Joaquim Ros i Bofarull, Etsuro Sotoo and Josep Maria Subirachs (creator of the Passion facade) have worked on the sculptural decoration. Completion is not expected until at least 2026.
Minor, late projects
During the last years of his life, apart from his devotion to the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; participated only in minor projects which were not completed: in 1916, on the death of his friend bishop Josep Torras i Bages, he designed a monument in his honour, which he wanted to place in front of the Passion facade of the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia. He made a sketch of the project, which ultimately was not carried out, and made a plaster bust of the bishop, the work of Joan Matamala under the instruction of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;. It was put in the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia, where it would have formed part of the church, but it was destroyed in 1936.136 Another commemorative monument project, also not carried out, was dedicated to Enric Prat de la Riba, which would have been situated in Castellter&lt;U+00E7&gt;ol, birthplace of this Catalan politician. The project dates from 1918, and would have consisted of a tall tower with two porticos and a spire topped with an iron structure flying the Catalan flag. The sketch of the project was done by Llu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Bonet i Gar&lt;U+00ED&gt;, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s assistant.137
In 1922 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was commissioned, by the Franciscan Padre Ang&lt;U+00E9&gt;lico Aranda, to construct a church dedicated to the Assumption in Rancagua (Chile).138 Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; apologised and said that he was occupied exclusively with the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia, but sent some sketches of the Assumption chapel which he had designed for the apse of the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia, which more or less coincided with what Padre Aranda had asked for. Unfortunately this project was not carried out, though there are currently plans by the Chilean architect Christian Matzner to take up the project, which if completed would become the first of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s works to be constructed in the Americas.139
The same year Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was consulted about the construction of a monumental train station for Barcelona (the future Estaci&lt;U+00F3&gt; de Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;a). Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; suggested an iron structure in the form of a large suspended awning, a solution quite ahead of its time; perhaps for this reason, it put the head engineers off, and they declined Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s offer. The last known projects by the architect are the chapel for the Col&lt;U+00F3&gt;nia Calvet in Torell&lt;U+00F3&gt;, of 1923, and a pulpit for Valencia (the exact location is unknown), of 1924. From then on, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; worked exclusively on the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia, until the fateful day of the accident which caused his death.
Collaborators
The enormous task which Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; faced, not in terms of the number of works, but in terms of their complexity, required the collaboration of a large number of assistants, artists, architects and craftsmen. Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; always led the way, but allowed expression of the individual abilities of all of his collaborators. A test of his expertise both in his field and in interpersonal communication was demonstrated in bringing together a large number of diverse professionals and creating an integrated team.140 Among his collaborators were:

World Heritage
Several of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s works have been granted World Heritage status by UNESCO: in 1984141 the Park G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell, the Palau G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell and the Casa Mil&lt;U+00E0&gt;; and in 2005142 the Nativity facade, the crypt and the apse of the Sagrada Fam&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia, the Casa Vicens and the Casa Batll&lt;U+00F3&gt; in Barcelona, together with the crypt of the Col&lt;U+00F2&gt;nia G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell in Santa Coloma de Cervell&lt;U+00F3&gt;.
The declaration of Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt;'s works as World Heritage aims to recognise his outstanding universal value. According to the citation:143

There is a certain controversy about whether he was born in Reus or Riudoms, his father's village near Reus. However, most specialists tend towards Reus: &lt;U+201C&gt;Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; was born in Carrer Sant Joan, close to the Pla&lt;U+00E7&gt;a Prim in Reus, according to most versions (&lt;U+2026&gt;) Nonetheless, Gaud&lt;U+00ED&gt; later on mischievously left these doors open when suggesting he might have been born in his father&lt;U+2019&gt;s workshop, just across the municipal border of Riudoms.&lt;U+201D&gt; ↩
