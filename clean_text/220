Career

Shankman was a dancer in Janet Jackson's &lt;U+201C&gt;Escapade&lt;U+201D&gt; video,5 as well as in a MC Skat Kat video with Paula Abdul. Shankman broke into professional choreography in a 1989 music video for rapper MC Shan with director Julien Temple. When the hired choreographer fell through, Shankman lied and said that he had done choregraphy for Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul. He was hired on the spot without his story being verified.6 Shankman began choreographing movies that included actors such as Marlon Brando, Sarah Jessica Parker, Antonio Banderas, and the cast of Boogie Nights.7 He is Brendan Fraser's exclusive choreographer.8

Prior to directing Hairspray, Shankman was known in Hollywood primarily as a fixer of lowbrow films&lt;U+2014&gt;a director who could take charge of lackluster productions that were expected to flop and turn them into box-office hits. His trademarks in his films often features a singing/dancing sequence and a character getting sent to do community service. &quot;I've done so many things I'm not super-proud of,&quot; he admitted in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. Having finally received a plum directing role in Hairspray, he added, &quot;Now that I'm finally really proud of something, if [critics] say this one isn't good either, it will be kind of...taxing.&quot;15 In August 2008, Box office Mojo reported that Hairspray had become the fourth-largest grossing American movie musical within the previous 30 years.16
Shankman, in affiliation with ABC, worked on a TV pilot called Harmony about a musical town.17 &quot;A new series about the female mayor of a small town has jumped from the back burner to the front, thanks to [Governor] Sarah Palin.
