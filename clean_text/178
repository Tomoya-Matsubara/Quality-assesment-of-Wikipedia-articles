Night and Fog () is a 1955 French documentary short film. Directed by Alain Resnais, it was made ten years after the liberation of Nazi concentration camps the documentary features the abandoned grounds of Auschwitz and Majdanek while describing the lives of prisoners in the camps. Night and Fog was made in collaboration by two survivors of the Holocaust, including writer Jean Cayrol and composer Hanns Eisler.
Resnais was originally hesitant about making the film and refused the offer to make it until Cayrol was contracted to write the script. The film was shot entirely in the year 1955 and is composed of contemporary shots of the camps and stock footage. Resnais and Cayrol found the film very difficult to make due to its graphic nature and subject matter. The film faced difficulties with French censors unhappy with a shot of a French police officer in the film, and with the German embassy in France, who attempted to halt the film's release at the Cannes Film Festival. Night and Fog was released to very positive acclaim and still receives very high praise today.
Synopsis
Night and Fog is a documentary that alternates between past and present and features both black and white and color footage. The first part of Night and Fog shows remnants of Auschwitz while the narrator Michel Bouquet describes the rise of Nazi ideology. The film continues to comparisons of the life of the Schutzstaffel in comparison to the starvation of the prisoners in the camps. Bouquet then discusses the sadistic elements of the people in the camps, including torture, scientific experiments, executions and the whorehouses. The next subject is shown completely in black and white and depicts images of gas chambers and piles of bodies. The final topic of the film depicts the liberation of the country, the discovery of the horror of the camps, and the questioning of who was responsible for them.
Production
Development
In 1954, the French publishing group Hachette released a book about eyewitness reports of deportation of the Jews.1 In November 1954, an exhibition of themes from the book was shown at Institut P&lt;U+00E9&gt;dagogique National in Paris.2 The historians Henri Michel and Olga Wormser proposed making a film in the context of their joint work in organizing this official exhibition to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the liberation of France.3 The first public notice of their project was given during a radio broadcast on November 10, 1954, the opening day of the exhibition.4
Film producers Anatole Dauman, Samy Halfton and Philippe Lifchitz were invited to this exhibit and felt that a film should be made on the subject.5 Anatole Dauman, originally from Warsaw, who undertook the production for Argos Films and arranged for co-financing by Films Polski, the Polish state production company.6 Dauman approached filmmaker Alain Resnais who had experience with documentary films since 1948.7 Resnais turned down the offer for over a week, feeling that only someone with first hand experience of concentration camps should attempt the subject matter. 8 Resnais eventually agreed providing that poet and novelist Jean Cayrol, who had been a concentration camp prisoner would collaborate on the project.9 Resnais officially signed his contract for the film on May 24, 1955.10 Cayrol had written in 1946 about his experience as a survivor of Mauthausen in Po&lt;U+00E8&gt;mes de la nuit et brouillard, which gave the documentary it's title. For Resnais, the film was meant to showcase a warning that the horrors of Nazism may be repeated during the Algerian War where torture and internment were already under way.11
The film was commissioned by two organizations: the Comit&lt;U+00E9&gt; d'histoire de la Deuxi&lt;U+00E8&gt;me Guerre mondiale, a government commission assigned the tasks of assembling documentary material on, and of launching historical inquiries and studies of, the period of the French occupation from 1940 to 1945. The other commissioner was and the R&lt;U+00E9&gt;seau du souvenir, an association devoted to the memory of those deported to camps. A pre-production meeting was held on May 28, 1955, during the course of which it was decided &quot;to explain clearly how the concentration-camp system (its economic aspect) flowed automatically from fascism&quot;. The film's working title, Resistance and Deportation, was also changed to the French translation of the German term Nacht und Nebel (Night and Fog), which described handling of World War II prisoners according to a decree promulgated by Himmler on December 7, 1941. This provided that those resisting the Reich, arrested in their own countries, but not promptly executed, would be deported to camps in such a way that they would vanish without a trace, &quot;into the night and fog&quot;. The title takes on yet another level of meaning a quarter of the way through the film, when Hanns Eisler's chilling score that has accompanied images of deportation is disrupted, as the train arrives at Auschwitz. The narrator observes that during the train ride &quot;death makes its first choice&quot; and &quot;a second is made upon arrival in the night and fog.&quot; The visuals cut to a shot of trains arriving in night and fog, which has become a metaphor for the mystery of their situation.12
Filming and scoring
The film draws on several sources including, black-and-white still images from various archives, excerpts from older black-and-white films from French, Soviet, and Polish newsreels, footage shot by detainees of the Westerbork internment camp in the Netherlands, or by the Allies' &quot;clean-up&quot; operations and new colour and black-and-white footage filmed at concentration camps in 1955.13 Resnais uses these to contrast the desolate tranquility of several concentration camps&lt;U+2014&gt;Auschwitz, Birkenau, Majdanek, Struthof, and Mathausen&lt;U+2014&gt;with the horrific events that occurred there during World War II, to muse on the diffusion of guilt, and to pose the question of responsibility.14 The film also deals briefly with the prisoners' conditions, and shows disturbing footage of prisoners and dead victims in the camps. While Night and Fog states that the Nazis made soap from the corpses, this claim is today seen as false. Researching the film was difficult for Resnais who would have nightmares from filming and found himself waking up screaming in the night.15 These nightmares passed as Resnais began filming in Auschwitz.16
From the September 29 to October 4, 1955, Resnais and his crew filmed at Auschwitz-Birkenau.17 From there, scenes were shot at Majdanek from October 7 to the 10th.18 For the archival material, Resnais had to use black and white footage and did not receive any from English, German or French military sources.19 Some of the stock footage in the film is from Michel and Wormser's exhibit.20 Other stock footage is from the Rijksinstituut voor Oorlogsdokumentatie from Holland, and from French television, Gaumont, and the association of former deportees.21 Cayrol was aided by mutual friend and film maker Chris Marker while writing the commentary that was spoken by actor Michel Bouquet.22 After viewing the images in the editing room, Cayrol became sick to his stomach and was unable to write further.23 Marker's contribution was to adapt the written text to the rhythm of the images in the film.24 While editing the film, Resnais felt a feeling of general discomfort, stating that he &quot;had scruples, knowing that making the film more beautiful would make it more moving - it upset me&quot;.25
Composer Hanns Eisler was invited to compose the music to Night and Fog by Argos Films on October 18, 1955 offering Eisler 200,000 francs and help in obtaining a visa to enter France.26 Eisler agreed to do it by telegram on October 25.27 The overture in the score had been written before Eisler was offered work on the film. It had originally been written for Bertold Brecht's play Winterschlacht. Eisler's inspiration for this piece was Horatio's monologue from Hamlet which Eisler had read in Karl Kraus' Weltgericht.28
Post-production and censorship
After the film was complete, producer Dauman told Resnais that he was &quot;delighted to have produced the film&quot;, but that he guaranteed that &quot;It will never see a theatrical release&quot;.29 In December 1955, French censors wanted some scenes cut from Night and Fog.30 The end of the film shows scenes of bodies being bulldozed into mass graves. These were considered too violent to be allowed in the film. Another point of contention was that Resnais had included photographs of French officers guarding a detention center where Jews were gathered before Deportation. This scene prompted a call demanding that the shot be cut because it &quot;might be offensive in the eyes of the present-day military&quot;.31 Resnais resisted this censorship, insisting that images of collaboration were important for the public to see.film.32 When Resnais refused to cut the scene with the officer, the censors pressured that they would cut off the last ten minutes of his film.33 Finally, to compromise, Resnais stated that obscuring the scene wouln't change the meaning of the film to him, and he painted a beam that obscured the kepi the officer was wearing.34 In exchange, Resnais would be allowed to show the bodies at the end of the film which was restored to its original form for a 2003 DVD release.35 The second act of censorship in the film was a huge scandal with the German embassy in France asking for the film to be withdrawn from the Cannes Film Festival.36 The French press including reacted against the proposed withdrawal noting that Cayrol and Resnais were very cautious in defining the difference between the Nazi criminals and the German people.37 Articles were written in french magazines including Lib&lt;U+00E9&gt;ration and L'Humanit&lt;U+00E9&gt; protesting any censorship of the film at Cannes.38 Of the few writers who supported to withdrawal, was Jean Dutourd who felt that Auschwitz and other concentration camps should be forgotten.39
Release
A local association of deported prisoners insisted the film to be shown at Cannes, threatening to occupy the screening room in their camp uniforms unless the festival showed the film.40 On 26 April, 1956 the film was announced to be shown out of competition at Cannes.41 Night and Fog was shown in commercial theaters in Paris, in May 1956.42 The film was awarded the Jean Vigo Prize, a French award for young filmmakers.43
Critical reception
The film received very high acclaim in France on its initial release. Jacques Doniol-Valcroze wrote in Cahiers du Cin&lt;U+00E9&gt;ma that the film was a powerful work comparable to work of artists Francisco Goya and Franz Kafka.44 French film critic and director Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Truffaut referred to Night and Fog as the greatest film ever made.45
Modern reception has also been positive. The film ranking website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 100% of critics had given the film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 14.46
Home media
Night and Fog was shown on television as early as April 26, 1959.47 On 10 May, 1990 a Jewish cemetery at Carpentras was profaned including the body of the freshly buried Felix Germont being impaled on a stake.4849 Response was strong to this act, including having Night and Fog broadcast on all three of the national television channels at the same time.50 The film has been shown as a teaching tool in schools in France for the past fifteen years.515253
