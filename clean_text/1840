Sheina MacAlister Marshall 1 (20 April 1896, Rothesay - 7 April 1977) was a Scottish marine zoologist who worked at the Scottish Marine Biological Association, at Millport, Cumbrae.2 She was &quot;a well known authority on two interrelated subjects: the physiology and life history of copepods (especially the genus Calanus), and the characteristics of marine productivity.&quot;3
Life
Sheina Marshall was born in Rothesay, &quot;the second of three distinguished daughters of Dr J. N. Marshall of Mount Stuart House&quot;.4 She was educated at Rothesay Academy and St Margaret's School, Polmont. She studied at Glasgow University during World War I, graduating in Zoology in 1919. She held a Carnegie Fellowship at Glasgow from 1920 until 1922, when she joined the Scottish Marine Biological Laboratory in Millport on the Isle of Cumbrae. There she worked with Andrew Picken Orr, with whom she co-authored several books and papers. She and Orr travelled to work with F. S. Russell and J. S. Colman on the 1928-29 Great Barrier Reef Expedition led by Maurice Yonge.5 She retired as Deputy Director of the Station in 1964, but remained there as an Honorary Fellow.6
In 1949 Marshall and Ethel Dobbie Currie became the first women to be admitted Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1961, awarded the OBE in 1966, and won the Royal Society of Edinburgh's Neill Prize in 1971.7 The library at the University Marine Biological Station Millport is now housed in a room named in her honour in 2010.8
