Ten Dollar Bill (also referred to as The Dollar Bill) is a 1956 proto-pop art lithographic drawing by Roy Lichtenstein. Considered to be a combination of Americana art and cubism, the work is referred to as the beginning to Lichtenstein's work on pop art. 25 editions of the lithograph were made by Lichtenstein, which were exhibited at several galleries. The piece is based on the ten-dollar bill and has impacted several of Lichtenstein's later works. The picture has received generally favorable reception from critics, and is considered to be one of the best artistic portrayals of currency.
Background and history
 Roy Lichtenstein began experimentation with printmaking in the late 1940s, well before its rise in popularity in the early 1960s. Lichtenstein created his first lithograph and woodcut artwork in 1948, while he was working on receiving his graduate degree in fine arts from Ohio State University.12 During the late 1940s, he created abstract paintings influenced by several artists, namely Pablo Picasso. From 1951 through early 1956, Lichtenstein painted &quot;jagged, post-cubist&quot; designs of famous American artworks. Many of his pieces reflected portraits of the American west, especially native Americans and cowboys, as well as other genres, such as works of president George Washington. The period is referred to by Lichtenstein as his &quot;American&quot; series, and was generally negatively received by critics.34 However, during this period, Lichtenstein also began experimenting in abstract expressionism, using the technique on several of his western painting designs. However, they were poorly received, being called by one critic &quot;like the doodling of a five-year old&quot;.5
Twenty-five editions of Ten Dollar Bill were created by Lichtenstein, which were given to several private collectors and museums.6 Starting in late October of 1994, Ten Dollar Bill, as well as 89 of Lichtenstein's print artworks went on display at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C..7 As a part of &quot;The Prints of Roy Lichtenstein&quot;, the piece was displayed in Washington until January 8, 1995 before it was moved to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and put on display starting in mid-February that year, as part of that city's WinterFest '95.8 The tour moved in May to the Dallas Museum of Art, the final place it was displayed.9 In December of 1996, Lichtenstein and his wife donated 154 prints of his artwork to the National Gallery of Art for permanent keeping. Among other famous pieces, including Crying Girl, was one of the copies of Ten Dollar Bill.10 An edition of the piece was a part of the showcase opening exhibit &quot;$how Me the Money: The Dollar As Art&quot; for the American Numismatic Association Money Museum, in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The exhibit ran from October 4, 2002, until December 1. The lithograph was showcased alongside work from Andy Warhol, Robert Dowd, and others.11 The work was part of the &quot;Roy Lichtenstein Prints 1956-1997&quot; collection, created entirely from the family gallery of Jordan Schnitzer. The tour began in June of 2006 at the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art, and traveled across the country,12 exhibiting in Austin, Texas and Las Vegas, among other places. The collection tour ended in 2008.1314
Description
Based on the design for the United States ten-dollar bill, Ten Dollar Bill measures , and is drawn on sheets of paper with dimensions of .15 Classified as a proto-pop art work, the lithograph is considered to be &quot;a Picasso-esque vision of what currency could look like&quot;, as well as a &quot;humorous&quot; combination of &quot;established art forms and Americana&quot;.1617 The drawing has the dimensions and shape of the ten-dollar bill, and completely covers the space needed, which has led to Lichtenstein being considered as &quot;almost seeming to be forging money&quot;. The picture has been described as being a &quot;brand-new bill of tender and not a picture of one&quot;.18 The &quot;schematic head&quot; of the medallion portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the prominent feature of the print, &quot;shows him as a planar, anteater-like being&quot; with a &quot;hair-do of the young Picasso&quot; and eyes similar to a &quot;figure by Francis Picabia.1920 The exterior framing for The Dollar Bill was &quot;simplified&quot; from the original dollar design, appearing in &quot;an imbalanced, drunken fashion&quot;.21
