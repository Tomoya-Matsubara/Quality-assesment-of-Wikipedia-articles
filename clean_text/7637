Delaware Route 1 (DE 1) is a  state highway in the U.S. state of Delaware. The route runs from the Maryland border in Fenwick Island, Sussex County, where it continues into that state as Maryland Route 528 (MD 528), north to an interchange with DE 58 in Christiana, New Castle County, where the road continues north as DE 7. Between Fenwick Island and Dover Air Force Base in Dover, Kent County, DE 1 is a four- to six-lane surface divided highway with occasional interchanges. The route heads north past the Delaware Beaches along the Atlantic Ocean before it runs northwest through rural areas, turning north at Milford to continue to Dover. Upon reaching Dover, DE 1 becomes the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, a four- to six-lane freeway that is tolled. Between Dover and Tybouts Corner, DE 1 parallels U.S. Route 13 (US 13), crossing over and featuring interchanges with it multiple times. Past Tybouts Corner, the freeway heads north to Christiana, reaching an interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95) a short distance before its terminus.
DE 1 was first designated in the 1970s between Fenwick Island and US 113 in Milford, replacing a portion of DE 14 and following the newly constructed Milford Bypass. DE 14 between Fenwick Island and Milford had been built as a state highway in the 1920s and 1930s and was widened into a divided highway between the 1950s and 1970s. In the 1980s, a limited-access Relief Route for US 13 was proposed between Dover and the Wilmington area in order to relieve that route of beach traffic. This relief route would be incorporated into DE 1 in 1988, with the route extended up US 113 between Milford and Dover to connect to the Relief Route. The tolled DE 1 freeway between Dover Air Force Base and Christiana opened in multiple stages between 1991 and 2003, and at a cost of $900 million was the largest public works project in Delaware history. The concurrent US 113 designation north of Milford was removed in 2004. Upgrades continue to be made to DE 1 such as the construction and improvement of interchanges as well as widening portions of the road.
Route description
Fenwick Island to Lewes
DE 1 begins at the Maryland border in the Delaware Beaches community of Fenwick Island in Sussex County, where the road continues south into Ocean City, Maryland as MD 528. From this point, DE 1 heads north on four-lane divided Coastal Highway. A block after the state line, the route intersects the eastern terminus of DE 54. The road continues north through business areas with some residences a short distance to the west of the Atlantic Ocean. DE 1 leaves Fenwick Island and heads into Fenwick Island State Park, running along a narrow strip of land with the Little Assawoman Bay to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. The route passes a small area of residential development before it goes through more of the state park. The road enters South Bethany, where it passes through residential areas. DE 1 heads into commercial areas in Middlesex Beach and briefly curves northwest before turning north again and continuing into Bethany Beach, where the road name changes to Delaware Avenue. The route runs past residences and comes to an intersection with DE 26, which heads east into the commercial center of Bethany Beach. The road curves northeast and leaves Bethany Beach as it passes to the east of a Delaware National Guard training site. Continuing north, DE 1 becomes Coastal Highway again and runs between wooded areas to the west and beachfront homes to the east. Farther north, the route crosses into Delaware Seashore State Park, where it travels along a strip of land between the Indian River Bay to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. DE 1 comes to a right-in/right-out access point to the park before it crosses over the Indian River Inlet on the cable-stayed Indian River Inlet Bridge.12
 Past the bridge, the road continues north through more of the state park between the Rehoboth Bay to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. The route travels near two World War II observation towers before it leaves Delaware Seashore State Park and enters Dewey Beach. At this point, DE 1 passes homes prior to running through business areas. The route comes to an intersection with the southern terminus of DE 1A, which heads north towards Rehoboth Beach. At this intersection, DE 1 turns northwest away from the Atlantic Ocean and passes through residential areas with some commercial development. The road leaves Dewey Beach and continues to a right-in/right-out interchange with DE 1B, which heads north into Rehoboth Beach. Immediately after, the route crosses over the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal on a high-level, twin span crossing and enters commercial areas. DE 1 intersects the northern terminus of DE 1A access road to Rehoboth Beach, at which point it widens to six lanes. The road passes more businesses and runs between two sections of the Tanger Outlets Rehoboth Beach outlet mall. Farther northwest, the route comes to an intersection with the eastern terminus of DE 24 and the southern terminus of DE 1D in Midway. DE 1 passes to the northeast of another part of the Tanger Outlets as it is lined with more businesses. In Carpenters Corner, the route intersects US 9, which travels northeast to provide access to Lewes and the Cape May-Lewes Ferry across the Delaware Bay. At this point, DE 1 becomes concurrent with US 9, and the two routes run through woods before curving west past businesses. In Five Points, US 9 splits from DE 1 by heading west concurrent with DE 404, with access to the northern termini of DE 23 and DE 1D, while US 9 Bus. heads northeast towards Lewes. Past Five Points, DE 1 narrows back to four lanes and bypasses Nassau to the southwest, curving northwest to pass over a Delaware Coast Line Railroad line on a bridge.34
Lewes to Dover Air Force Base
 After the bridge over the railroad line, DE 1 leaves the Delaware Beaches area and heads into a mix of farm fields and residential and commercial development, traveling to the northeast of Red Mill Pond. The road continues through more agricultural areas with some residential subdivisions and woods. The route crosses over the Broadkill River and passes to the southwest of a golf course before it comes to a junction with DE 16, which heads west to Milton and east to Broadkill Beach. Following this, DE 1 continues through farmland and woodland to the southwest of the Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge, reaching an intersection with the northern terminus of DE 5. Immediately after this intersection, the road travels to the east of Waples Pond and runs north-northwest through more agricultural areas. The route curves northwest as it bypasses the community of Argos Corner to the southwest. Past here, DE 1 crosses Cedar Creek and passes near a couple residential subdivisions before intersecting DE 30 Alt. A short distance later, the road reaches to an interchange with the northern terminus of DE 30. After this interchange, the route comes to a northbound exit and southbound entrance with DE 1 Bus., which heads northwest into Milford. At this point, DE 1 curves north and becomes the Milford Bypass, which heads around the eastern part of the city. The route passes between residential development to the west and farmland to the east before turning northwest into wooded areas and coming to a diamond interchange with DE 36.56
 Past this interchange, DE 1 crosses the Mispillion River into Kent County and continues northwest to an intersection with the eastern terminus of DE 14. The road runs between commercial development to the southwest and a wooded residential neighborhood to the northeast, crossing Northeast 10th Street. The route passes near more development before it comes to a southbound exit and northbound entrance with the northern terminus of US 113 and DE 1 Bus. at the northern end of Milford. Past this interchange, DE 1 becomes Bay Road and travels to the east of Tub Mill Pond before it runs through a mix of farmland and residential and commercial development. The route intersects Thompsonville Road and continues through farmland with some woods and development. The road curves northwest and comes to an intersection with Frederica Road, which heads to the town of Frederica. DE 1 bends to the north and bypasses Frederica to the east, crossing over the Murderkill River. The route has an interchange with the eastern terminus of DE 12, which heads south into Frederica. The road runs north through agricultural areas before it reaches the community of Little Heaven. Here, DE 1 intersects Bowers Beach Road, which travels east to Bowers Beach along the Delaware Bay. The route passes near homes and businesses and reaches an intersection with Clapham Road, which heads northwest towards Magnolia and Rising Sun. Following this, the road runs through farmland with some woods before coming to a right-in/right-out interchange with Trap Shooters Road that provides access to Magnolia. DE 1 crosses over the St. Jones River and continues north to a diamond interchange with the southern terminus of DE 9, at which point it enters the city limits of Dover. At this interchange, the route turns northwest and passes between an asphalt plant to the southwest and the runways of Dover Air Force Base to the northeast.78
Dover Air Force Base to Christiana
 Along the Dover Air Force Base boundary, DE 1 transitions from a four-lane divided surface road a freeway called the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, which is a toll road. The first interchange is a northbound exit and entrance which serves the commercial gate of Dover Air Force Base. The freeway passes between the air base golf course to the southwest and various base buildings to the northeast before it reaches a diamond interchange serving the main gate to the northeast and base housing to the southwest. After this, the route continues between base residences and the main part of the base prior to reaching a northbound exit and southbound entrance at the eastern terminus of DE 10 and Bay Road that also serves the north gate of Dover Air Force Base. DE 1 runs north along the west side of Bay Road before it passes over it, where there is a southbound exit and entrance and a northbound entrance that serves to provide access to DE 10 from southbound DE 1 and to northbound DE 1. Immediately after this is a southbound exit and northbound entrance with the Puncheon Run Connector, which heads west to provide access to US 13. The freeway continues north along the eastern edge of Dover and comes to a southbound exit and northbound entrance at DE 8, which provides access to downtown Dover. Past this interchange, the highway turns northwest through rural areas before it comes to the Dover mainline toll plaza. DE 1 passes to the northeast of Dover International Speedway and comes to a trumpet interchange that provides access to US 13 and Scarborough Road, serving the northern part of Dover. This interchange has a toll plaza on the southbound exit and northbound entrance. Following this interchange, the toll road leaves Dover and continues through wooded areas with some fields and nearby development. The route heads to the east of the Cheswold area, passing under DE 42 without an interchange, and curves north, crossing the Leipsic River. DE 1 continues thorough rural areas a short distance to the east of US 13 before it reaches Smyrna. Here, the freeway comes to a trumpet interchange serving US 13 at the southern edge of town, with tolls on the southbound exit and northbound entrance. The highway runs to the east of Smyrna with residential development to the west and rural land to the east, passing under DE 6 with no access.910
 DE 1 curves northwest and crosses the Duck Creek into New Castle County, where it heads through farmland with some woods. The route crosses US 13 at an interchange to the north of Smyrna, with access to a rest area along US 13. The tollway continues northwest through rural areas to the west of US 13, curving north and crossing over the highway once to briefly travel along its east side prior to another bridge over it to again run to the west of it as it passes to the east of the Townsend area. DE 1 heads north and closely follows along the west side of US 13 as it runs through more rural areas with residential development to the east. The freeway turns northwest away from US 13 and crosses the Appoquinimink River, passing to the northeast of a residential neighborhood before coming to a diamond interchange with DE 299, which provides access to Middletown to the west and Odessa and US 13 to the east. Past this interchange, DE 1 curves northeast and passes over US 13 again before it turns north and crosses Drawyer Creek. The freeway continues north a short distance to the east of US 13 past residential subdivisions as it comes to a diamond interchange with Pole Bridge Road, which heads west to intersect US 13 and the southern terminus of DE 896 in Boyds Corner. This interchange has tolls on the northbound exit and southbound entrance. After this interchange, DE 1 curves northwest and crosses over US 13, turning north and reaching the Biddles Corner mainline toll plaza, which marks the north end of tolling along DE 1.1112
 After the toll plaza, DE 1 widens to six lanes and comes to a southbound exit and northbound entrance providing access to US 13 in St. Georges. The freeway turns northwest and crosses the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal on the cable-stayed Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Bridge. The highway passes through a mix of fields and residential subdivisions and curves north to come to a diamond interchange with US 13 and DE 72 to the west of Delaware City. At this point, US 13 becomes concurrent with DE 1, with the freeway running through farmland and passing over Norfolk Southern's Delaware City Secondary railroad line and DE 7 to the west of the Delaware City Refinery. US 13 and DE 1 continue concurrent to Tybouts Corner, where DE 1 splits at an interchange to continue as a freeway and US 13 heads northeast as a surface divided highway. Within this interchange is the northern terminus of DE 71, which southbound DE 1 has a direct ramp to. Past Tybouts Corner, DE 1 narrows to four lanes and travels north past residential subdivisions, passing over Norfolk Southern's New Castle Secondary before coming to the US 40 interchange in Bear. The highway continues north and reaches an interchange with DE 273 in Christiana. The freeway runs through wooded areas and crosses the Christina River before it comes to an interchange with DE 7 that serves the Christiana Mall to the east of the road. At this point, DE 7 joins DE 1 on the freeway, passing to the west of the mall before coming to a modified cloverleaf interchange with I-95 (Delaware Turnpike) that has flyover ramps from between northbound DE 1/DE 7 and northbound I-95 and between southbound I-95 and southbound DE 1/DE 7. Past I-95, the freeway heads through commercial areas before it comes to an interchange with DE 58. At this point, DE 1 and the freeway end while DE 7 continues north as a divided surface road.1314
DE 1 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 97,964 vehicles at the US 40 interchange to a low of 11,539 vehicles at the northern boundary of Fenwick Island.15 DE 1 is a part of the National Highway System between the Maryland border in Fenwick Island and US 13 north of Smyrna and between the US 13/DE 72 interchange near Delaware City and the northern terminus at DE 7 and DE 58 in Christiana.16

History
South of Dover
 The portion of DE 1 between Milford and Little Heaven was initially built as part of the DuPont Highway, a highway that spanned the state from Selbyville to Wilmington. The highway was proposed as a modern road that was part of a philanthropic measure. This roadway was planned to improve travel and bring economic development to Kent and Sussex counties. The DuPont Highway was to be modeled after the great boulevards of Europe and was to have a  wide right-of-way consisting of a  wide roadway for automobiles flanked by dual trolley lines,  wide roadways for heavy vehicles,  wide unpaved roadways for horses, and sidewalks. Utilities were to be buried underground below the horse roadways. The highway was also to include agricultural experimental stations and monuments for future surveying. Trolley revenues would help pay for the construction of the roadway. After portions of the DuPont Highway were built, these portions were planned to be turned over to the state at no charge.21
In 1911, the Coleman DuPont Road, Inc. was established and construction on the highway began.22 By 1912, construction was interrupted by litigation challenging both the constitutionality of the law establishing the road building corporation and the need for DuPont to acquire such a large right-of-way.23 DuPont would narrow the proposed right-of-way to  in order to compromise with opponents of the highway in addition to offering landowers whose properties were affected by the highway five times the assessed value of the land five years after the highway was completed.24 The DuPont Highway would end up being built on a  alignment with a  wide roadway. The DuPont Highway north of Milford would be both designed and constructed by Delaware State Highway Department (DSHD).25 A portion of the road north of Milford and from Frederica to Little Heaven were completed by 1920.26 The portion of the DuPont Highway from north of Milford to Frederica was under construction in 1920 and completed by 1923, the same year the last section of the entire Selbyville&lt;U+2013&gt;Wilmington highway was completed near Odessa.27 When the U.S. Highway System was designated in 1926, this portion of the DuPont Highway became a part of US 113.2829
The portion of DE 1 between Little Heaven and Dover Air Force Base was built as part of a Dover bypass for US 113. This bypass was built atop existing Bay Road north of the present-day DE 9 interchange and on a new alignment south of there.30 The new highway between Little Heaven and Bay Road would cross the St. Jones River at a site called Barkers Landing. Between December 1931 and the end of 1933, DSHD constructed a causeway across  of the marsh on the east bank of the river, a process that required multiple applications of fill dirt and dynamite to create a stable surface for a modern highway.31 A Scherzer rolling lift bascule bridge was constructed across the St. Jones River in 1934. Bay Road was widened and the new sections of highway were built with  wide concrete pavement starting in 1934.32 US 113 was relocated to the bypass when the new highway opened for Memorial Day in 1935.33
US 113 was widened into a divided highway from north of Milford to south of Frederica and around Dover Air Force Base in 1959.34 A four-lane divided bypass to the east of Frederica was constructed in 1965.35 US 113 between Frederica and Little Heaven was expanded in 1975.3637 US 113 between Little Heaven and Dover Air Force Base was expanded to a divided highway in 1984 and 1985; this project included replacing the two-lane drawbridge over the St. Jones River with a four-lane girder bridge.3839
 What would become DE 1 between Milford and Rehoboth Beach was originally a county road by 1920.40 By 1924, the road was proposed as a state highway between Nassau and Rehoboth Beach.41 A year later, the state highway was completed between Milford and Cedar Creek and from Nassau to just west of Rehoboth Beach, with the sections between Cedar Creek and Nassau and into Rehoboth Beach under proposal.42 In 1927, the state highway between Milford and Rehoboth Beach was completed with the construction of a bascule bridge over the Broadkill River.4344 In 1931, a state gravel road was extended from Bethany Beach to the Indian River Inlet, providing access to the inlet for recreational purposes.45 In January 1933, bids were made for construction of a gravel road from Dewey Beach south to the Indian River Inlet as well as for a timber bridge across the inlet, connecting with the gravel road between the Indian River Inlet and Bethany Beach. This gravel road would provide a direct connection between Bethany Beach and Rehoboth Beach and would provide better access to the Atlantic coast for recreation.46 The Ocean Highway between Bethany Beach and Rehoboth Beach was completed in 1933. In fall of that year, the roadway between Bethany Beach and Indian River Inlet was paved, with recommendations to pave the road north from the Indian River Inlet toward Rehoboth Beach.47 In 1934, the Ocean Highway between the Indian River Inlet and Rehoboth Beach was paved. The same year, recommendations were made to extend the Ocean Highway south from Bethany Beach to Fenwick Island, where it would lead to a Maryland state highway continuing to Ocean City.48
When Delaware designated its state highway system by 1936, the state highway between Milford and Bethany Beach became a part of DE 14, which continued west from Milford to the Maryland border near Burrsville, Maryland.49 In 1939, a southern extension of DE 14 was built between Bethany Beach and the Maryland border in Fenwick Island as a gravel road.5051 In 1940, a swing bridge opened across the Indian River Inlet.5253 The same year, work began for a bypass of the route between Dewey Beach and west of Rehoboth Beach, which included a bascule bridge over the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal.54 In 1942, the Rehoboth Beach bypass for DE 14 was completed.5556 In addition, the roadway was paved between Fenwick Island and Bethany Beach by that year.57 In 1952, a new swing bridge opened across the Indian River Inlet after the previous bridge was destroyed by ice and tides in 1948.58
 The route was widened into a divided highway between DE 18 (now US 9) in Nassau and Rehoboth Beach in 1954 in order to provide relief to traffic heading to the beaches. Channelized intersections were built at DE 18 and the entrance to Rehoboth Beach.5960 As part of this widening, DE 14 was moved to a new alignment to bypass Wescoats Corner, removing a concurrency with DE 18 (now US 9 Bus.).61 In 1965, a new dual bridge was constructed across the Indian River Inlet.62 By 1966, DE 14A was designated onto the former alignment of DE 14 through Rehoboth Beach.63 The divided highway portion of DE 14 was extended north to DE 16, which included a bypass of Nassau, and between the Indian River Inlet and South Bethany in 1967.6465 By 1967, a divided bypass of Milford running from DE 14 southeast of Milford to US 113 north of Milford was under proposal.66 Structural design on the Milford Bypass began in 1968.67 In 1969, design work began on widening DE 14 into a divided highway between DE 16 and the Milford Bypass.68 The route was widened into a divided highway between Dewey Beach and the Indian River Inlet the same year.6970 In 1971, the divided Miford Bypass between DE 14 southeast of Milford and US 113 north of Milford was completed.7172 In 1971, a contract was awarded to widen DE 14 to a divided highway between Fenwick Island and South Bethany.73 This widening project was completed a year later.74 In 1973, construction was underway to make DE 14 a divided highway from the Milford Bypass to DE 16, which included a bypass of Argos Corner; this was completed in 1974.75
In 1974, DE 1 was signed concurrent with DE 14 east of Milford and on the Milford Bypass.76 Work began in 1975 to widen the portion of DE 14 bypassing Rehoboth Beach, which included a new bridge over the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal.77 In 1977, DE 14 was truncated to Milford, with DE 1 replacing the route between Fenwick Island and the south end of the Milford Bypass.7879 As a result of this, DE 14A was renumbered to DE 1A.80 A new high-level bridge carrying DE 1 over the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal opened in 1978.81 By 1981, DE 1 was widened to a divided highway between Dewey Beach and southwest of Rehoboth Beach except for the crossing of the canal.82 In 1985, the crossing over the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal was dualized with a high-level bridge constructed for northbound traffic.83 DE 1 was designated along US 113 between Milford and Dover in 1988.84 In 2004, the concurrent US 113 designation along DE 1 between Milford and Dover Air Force Base was removed.8586 On September 11, 2006, work began on a $9.7 million project to widen DE 1 between DE 24 in Midway and US 9 in Five Points by adding a third southbound lane and a multi-use lane in both directions. The project was completed on June 9, 2008.87
 DelDOT has replaced several at-grade intersections along DE 1 south of Dover with grade-separated interchanges. The intersection with DE 9 near Dover Air Force Base was rebuilt into an interchange in 2009.88 In November 2009, construction began for a grade-separated interchange with DE 12 in Frederica; the interchange was completed in June 2011.8990 In November 2012, construction began on an interchange at DE 30 southeast of Milford. The interchange between DE 1 and DE 30 was completed in July 2014.91 There are plans to replace several at-grade intersections with grade separated intersections along the route. They include Frederica Road in Frederica,92 Bowers Beach Road in Little Heaven,93 Thompsonville Road in Milford,94 and DE 14 in Milford.95
In 2009, work began to replace the steel-girder Indian River Inlet Bridge with a cable-stayed span due to scouring that had occurred to the steel girder bridge.9697 The new Indian River Inlet Bridge opened to southbound traffic on January 20, 2012. Delaware Governor Jack Markell, U.S. Senator Tom Carper, and DelDOT Secretary Shailen Bhatt rode in the first car across the bridge.98 On January 30, 2012, one northbound lane of the new bridge opened.99100 All four lanes of the bridge as well as the pedestrian and bicycle walkway opened in Spring 2012.101 Demolition of the 1965 bridge began in Spring 2012 and was completed in Spring 2013.102
Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway
 Between 1958 and 1971, studies were conducted for a bypass of the segment of US 13 through Dover along with a connector between Dover and Frederica.103 The proposed routing began at US 113 and DE 12 north of Frederica and continued northwest to Woodside, where it was planned to cross US 13. From here, the bypass was to run to the west of Dover and head north to its terminus at US 13 north of Cheswold.104 As part of planning of the Dover Bypass, an archaeological survey had to be conducted along part of the proposed route between 1972 and 1975. By 1976, construction of the Dover Bypass was postponed indefinitely.105 From 1971 to 1978, a north-south extension of the Delaware Turnpike between Wilmington and Dover was studied. In 1983, studies began for a &quot;Relief Route&quot; of US 13 between Dover and Wilmington.106 The new highway was proposed in order to relieve US 13 of traffic heading to the Delaware Beaches in the summer.107 Prior to the beginning of construction, an archaeological survey was conducted along the proposed route of the freeway in 1986.108 The same year, plans were unveiled for the route, which would begin at US 113 south of Dover and head north to US 13 in Tybouts Corner. The Relief Route would cross US 13 several times, passing to the east of Dover and Smyrna and to the west of Odessa.109 The section of DE 1 between Tybouts Corner and Christiana had originally been planned as relief route for DE 7, a two-lane road that connected US 13 to I-95 that saw a lot of congestion.110
In July 1987, construction began on the first segment of the freeway between US 40 in Bear and DE 273 in Christiana.111112 In 1988, the US 13 Relief Route was given the DE 1 designation. DE 1 was extended from its northern terminus in Milford to follow US 113 between Milford and Dover and US 13 between Dover and Tybouts Corner.113114 Construction on the freeway between US 13 in Tybouts Corner and US 40 in Bear began in March 1988. In August of that year, groundbreaking took place for the section of the DE 1 toll road between Dover and Smyrna. Construction commenced on DE 1 between DE 273 and I-95 in Christiana in August 1990. The first section of the DE 1 freeway opened in August 1991 between US 13 in Tybouts Corner and US 40 in Bear. Three months later, the freeway opened north to DE 273 in Christiana.115
In April 1992, groundbreaking took place for the section of DE 1 across the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal.116 It was decided that the highway would cross the canal on a cable-stayed bridge.117 The section of DE 1 between DE 273 and I-95 in Christiana opened in April 1993.118 The section of the tollway between US 113 at Dover Air Force Base and US 13 north of Smyrna opened on December 21, 1993, with Governor Tom Carper in attendance at the opening ceremony. This section opened with a mainline toll barrier and ramp tolls.119120 When this section of DE 1 opened, road signs, with the exception of speed limit signs, were in metric units in anticipation of the United States converting to the metric system.121 Following the completion of this section, DE 1 was rerouted off US 113 and US 13 between Dover and Smyrna.122
 In December 1995, the section of DE 1 between US 13 in St. Georges and US 13 in Tybouts Corner opened, which included the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Bridge.123124 Prior to the opening of this section, a bridge walk was held over the canal.125 Following the completion of this segment, DE 1 was rerouted off the surface alignment of US 13 that crossed the St. Georges Bridge.126 Subsequently, US 13 was rerouted to follow the new DE 1 between the DE 72 interchange and Tybouts Corner.127128 Construction of the new DE 1 had severed US 13 south of Tybouts Corner, with part of the former alignment north of the DE 7 intersection becoming a two-lane road while the section south of there became an extended DE 7 to the intersection with US 13 and DE 72.129 In building DE 1 across the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, there were initially plans to demolish the aging St. Georges Bridge that carried US 13 over the canal. The plan drew concerns from residents in St. Georges who feared the community would be split in half. The St. Georges Bridge was instead kept and was refurbished. A southbound exit and northbound entrance at US 13 south of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Bridge along DE 1 was built as required by federal legislation that gave the state $115 million toward construction of the new canal bridge.130
Construction of an interchange at the Dover Air Force Base main gate commenced in February 1996.131 This project resulted in the relocation of the main gate further back in order to build the interchange and the overpass linking the main gate to base housing. This construction resulted in facilities having to be constructed at the north gate in order to be able to handle base traffic.132 In May of that year, groundbreaking took place for the DE 1 toll road between Odessa and St. Georges.133 The segment of DE 1 between US 13 south of Odessa and US 13 in St. Georges opened in November 1999.134135 DE 1 was subsequently rerouted off US 13 between those two points.136
 In March 2000, groundbreaking took place for the final segment of the DE 1 freeway between Smyrna and Odessa. The interchange at the Dover Air Force Base main gate was completed in July of that year.137 The construction of the final segment resulted in a portion of US 13 south of Odessa being shifted further east as DE 1 would be built on top of the road. A service road would serve properties on the southbound side of US 13.138 In October 2001, northbound US 13 was realigned to the new alignment south of Odessa in order to build DE 1 in that area.139 In May 2002, US 13 was shifted to a new southbound alignment south of Odessa, with the former portion of the route in that area becoming a service road known as Harris Road.140141 On September 5, 2002, a partial interchange opened at DE 8 in Dover, utilizing existing emergency vehicle ramps.142143 This interchange was included in the initial plans for the highway but was dropped due to low traffic volumes. As part of building the interchange, DelDOT purchased development rights to adjacent land parcels in order to prevent additional development in the area of the interchange.144
On May 19, 2003, Governor Ruth Ann Minner cut the ribbon for the final section of the DE 1 toll road between US 13 north of Smyrna and US 13 south of Odessa.145146 This section opened to traffic two days later.147 As a result, DE 1 was moved off US 13 between Smyrna and Odessa.148 The total cost to build the toll road was $900 million and it was the largest public works project in Delaware history.149 As part of building DE 1, DelDOT created new wetlands to replace the ones that were lost in construction of the highway.150
Traffic congestion at the cloverleaf interchange with I-95 in Christiana led to DelDOT to improve the interchange. The project included adding flyover connecting ramps from northbound DE 1 to northbound I-95 and from southbound I-95 to southbound DE 1 which allowed for easier merging patterns and the elimination of lengthy backups on the former ramp design.151152 Construction of a new &quot;ring access road&quot; around Christiana Mall began in February 2011153 and was completed in March 2012, with a newly built bridge over DE 1, just south of the I-95 interchange.154 The ramp from southbound I-95 to southbound DE 1/DE 7 opened on August 27, 2013 and the ramp from northbound DE 1/DE 7 to northbound I-95 opened on October 17, 2013, with a ribbon cutting ceremony attended by Governor Jack Markell and DelDOT secretary Shailen Bhatt.155156
DelDOT has plans to widen DE 1 by an additional lane in each direction between the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Bridge and the DE 273 interchange in Christiana. The project will involve widening bridges and reconfiguring interchanges. This project is expected to start in 2016.157

DE 1A


Delaware Route 1A (DE 1A) is a state highway in Sussex County. The route runs  from DE 1 in Dewey Beach to another intersection with DE 1 west of Rehoboth Beach. The route provides access to Rehoboth Beach from DE 1, heading north before turning to the west. DE 1A follows King Charles Avenue, Bayard Avenue, 2nd Street (southbound), Christian Street (northbound), and Rehoboth Avenue.158159
What is now DE 1A was originally a part of DE 14 between 1936 and 1942.160161 The road was designated DE 14A by 1966.162 In the 1970s, DE 1A was designated along DE 14A for a few years before DE 14A was decommissioned in favor of DE 1A.163164 Between 2002 and 2006, a streetscape project revitalized the Rehoboth Avenue portion of the route and a roundabout was added at the entrance to Rehoboth Beach.165166 {{-}}
DE 1B

 Delaware Route 1B (DE 1B) is a  state highway spur of DE 1 that allows access to and from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. DE 1B starts at the southern approach to the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal bridge on DE 1, with right-in/right-out ramps providing access to both directions of DE 1. From this point, DE 1B heads west from DE 1 as a two-lane undivided road, curving north and passing under the DE 1 bridge over the canal. The route intersects State Road, which provides access to and from the northbound lanes of DE 1, at which point it heads northeast away from the canal on State Road. DE 1B continues into Rehoboth Beach and passes homes before reaching its terminus at DE 1A.167168

DE 1D

Delaware Route 1D (DE 1D) is an auxiliary route of DE 1 in Sussex County. The route begins at DE 1 in Midway, where it heads southwest concurrent with DE 24 on four-lane divided John J. Williams Highway. The road passes homes and businesses as it transitions into a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane. DE 1D splits from DE 24 by heading northwest onto two-lane undivided Plantation Road concurrent with DE 24 Alt. The road heads through a mix of farmland and residential development. Upon reaching Five Points, the road curves southwest and comes to an intersection with DE 23. At this point, DE 1D ends while the road continues southwest as DE 23 and DE 24 Alt. DE 23 heads north at this point to immediately intersect US 9/DE 404, which head east to provide access to DE 1.169170 DE 1D was designated by 1996.171 The portion of the route along Plantation Road became concurrent with DE 24 Alt. by 2006.172

DE 1 Business

Delaware Route 1 Business (DE 1 Bus.) is a business route of DE 1 that runs through Milford. DE 1 Bus. starts at a partial interchange with DE 1 southeast of Milford in Sussex County, with access to southbound DE 1 and from northbound DE 1. From this interchange, the route heads northwest into Milford as two-lane undivided Rehoboth Boulevard, passing residential subdivisions. The road continues past homes and some businesses, passing to the east of Marshall Millpond before reaching an intersection with DE 36. DE 1 Bus. curves north before it heads northwest into wooded areas and passes over the Mispillion River on a drawbridge, at which point it enters Kent County. The route heads into business areas and crosses DE 14. The road continues past commercial establishments and turns north onto North Walnut Street. DE 1 Bus. heads north to an intersection with US 113, at which point it becomes concurrent with that route on four-lane divided Dupont Boulevard. US 113 and DE 1 Bus. continue north for a short distance and end at which point the road merges onto northbound DE 1 at a partial interchange at the north end of Milford. 173174
What is now DE 1 Bus. south of DE 36 and along North Walnut Street and US 113 was completed as a state highway by 1925.175 In 1926, suggestions were made to build a bypass east of Milford connecting DuPont Boulevard (US 113) north of town to the state highway leading southeast to Rehoboth Beach in order to provide a better route to the beaches and relieve traffic congestion in Milford during the summer months.176 In 1928, plans were made to build the bypass, which included a drawbridge over the Mispillion River.177 Construction on the drawbridge was underway in 1929.178 The bypass to the east of Milford, along with the drawbridge, were completed in 1930.179 When Delaware designated its state highways by 1936, DE 14 was designated along Rehoboth Boulevard south of Northeast Front Street, where the route turned to the west.180 The divided Milford Bypass to the east of the city was completed in 1971.181182 In 1977, DE 1 Bus. was designated onto its current alignment, running concurrent with DE 14 southeast of Northeast Front Street.183184 The DE 14 concurrency was removed by 1984 when that route was realigned to follow Northeast Front Street to DE 1.185
