Millennium Park is a public park located in the Loop community area of Chicago in Illinois, USA. It is a prominent civic center of the city's Lake Michigan lakefront that covers a  section of northwestern Grant Park. The area was previously occupied by Illinois Central rail yards and parking lots. The park, which is bounded by Michigan Avenue, Randolph Street, Columbus Drive and East Monroe Drive, features a variety of public art. As of 2009, Millennium Park trailed only Navy Pier as a Chicago tourist attraction.1
Planning of the park began in October 1997. Construction began in October 1998, and Millennium Park was opened in a ceremony on July 16, 2004, four years behind schedule. The three-day opening celebrations were attended by some 300,000 people and included an inaugural concert by the Grant Park Orchestra and Chorus. The park has received awards for its accessibility and green design.2 Millennium Park has free admission,3 and features the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, Cloud Gate, the Crown Fountain, the Lurie Garden and other attractions. The park is connected by the BP Pedestrian Bridge and the Nichols Bridgeway to other parts of Grant Park. Because the park sits atop a parking garage and former railroad tracks, it is considered the world's largest rooftop garden.
Millennium Park is considered to be the city's most important project since the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893,45 and it far exceeded its originally proposed budget of $150 million. The final cost of $475 million was borne by Chicago taxpayers and private donors. The city paid $270 million; private donors paid the rest,6 and assumed roughly half of the financial responsibility for the cost overruns.7 The construction delays and cost overruns were attributed to poor planning, many design changes, and cronyism. Many critics have praised the completed park.
Background
 From 1852 until 1997, the Illinois Central Railroad owned the right of way that separated downtown Chicago from Lake Michigan and used parts of it for railroad tracks.8 In 1871, Union Base-Ball Grounds was built on the site that became Millennium Park; the Chicago White Stockings played home games there until the grounds were destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire.910 Lake Front Park, the White Stockings' new ball grounds, was built in 1878 with a short right field due to the railroad tracks. The grounds were improved and the seating capacity was doubled in 1883, but the team had to move after the season ended the next year, as the federal government had given the city the land &quot;with the stipulation that no commercial venture could use it&quot;.1112 Daniel Burnham planned Grant Park around the Illinois Central Railroad property in his 1909 Plan of Chicago.13 In 1997, when the city gained control of the land in the form of airspace rights, it decided to build a parking facility there, over the tracks.14 Eventually, the city realized that a grand civic amenity might lure private dollars in a way that a municipal improvement would not, and thus began the effort to create Millennium Park.15 The park was originally planned under the name Lakefront Millennium Park.16

Daley's trademarks, such as wrought iron and seasonal flower boxes.23 Millennium Park project manager Edward Uhlir said &quot;Frank is just the cutting edge of the next century of architecture,&quot;24 and noted that no other architect was being sought.25 Gehry was approached several times by Skidmore architect Adrian Smith on behalf of the city.26 His hesitance and refusal to accept the commission was overcome by Cindy Pritzker, the philanthropist, who had developed a relationship with the architect when he won the Pritzker Prize in 1991. According to John H. Bryan, who led fund-raising for the park, Pritzker enticed Gehry in face-to-face discussions, using a $15 million funding commitment toward the bandshell's creation.27 Having Gehry get involved helped the city realize its vision of having modern themes in the park; upon rumors of his involvement the Chicago Sun-Times proclaimed &quot;Perhaps the future has arrived&quot;,28 while the Chicago Tribune noted that &quot;The most celebrated architect in the world may soon have a chance to bring Chicago into the 21st Century&quot;.29

Plans for the park were officially announced in March 1998 and construction began in September of that year. Initial construction was under the auspices of the Chicago Department of Transportation, because the project bridges the railroad tracks. However, as the project grew and expanded, its broad variety of features and amenities outside the scope of the field of transportation placed it under the jurisdiction of the city's Public Buildings Commission.30
In April 1999, the city announced that the Pritzker family had donated $15 million to fund Gehry's bandshell and an additional nine donors committed $10 million.3132 The day of this announcement, Gehry agreed to the design request.33 In November, when his design was unveiled, Gehry said the bridge design was preliminary and not well-conceived because funding for it was not committed. 34 The need to fund a bridge to span the eight-lane Columbus Drive was evident, but some planning for the park was delayed in anticipation of details on the redesign of Soldier Field.35 In January 2000, the city announced plans to expand the park to include features that became Cloud Gate, the Crown Fountain, the McDonalds Cycle Center, and the BP Pedestrian Bridge.36 Later that month, Gehry unveiled his new winding design for the bridge.37
Mayor Daley's influence was key in getting corporate and individual sponsors to pay for much of the park.38 Bryan, the former chief executive officer (CEO) of Sara Lee Corporation who spearheaded the fundraising,39 says that sponsorship was by invitation and no one refused the opportunity to be a sponsor.40 One Time magazine writer describes the park as the crowning achievement for Mayor Daley,41 while another suggests the park's cost and time overages were examples of the city's mismanagement.42 The July 16&lt;U+2013&gt;18, 2004, opening gala was sponsored by J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.43
The community surrounding Millennium Park has become one of the most fashionable residential addresses in Chicago. In 2006, Forbes named the park's 60602 zip code as the hottest in terms of price appreciation in the country,44 with upscale buildings such as The Heritage at Millennium Park (130 N. Garland) leading the way for other buildings, such as Waterview Tower, The Legacy and Joffrey Tower. The median sale price for residential real estate was $710,000 in 2005 according to Forbes, also ranking it on the list of most expensive zip codes.45 The park has been credited with increasing residential real estate values by $100 per square foot ($1,076 per m2).46
Features
 Millennium Park is a portion of the larger Grant Park, known as the &quot;front lawn&quot; of downtown Chicago,47 and has four major artistic highlights: the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, Cloud Gate, the Crown Fountain, and the Lurie Garden.48 Millennium Park is successful as a public art venue in part due to the grand scale of each piece and the open spaces for display.49 A showcase for postmodern architecture, it also features the McCormick Tribune Ice Skating Rink, the BP Pedestrian Bridge, the Joan W. and Irving B. Harris Theater for Music and Dance, Wrigley Square, the McDonald's Cycle Center, the Exelon Pavilions, the AT&amp;T Plaza, the Boeing Galleries, the Chase Promenade, and the Nichols Bridgeway.50
Millennium Park is considered one of the largest green roofs in the world, having been constructed on top of a railroad yard and large parking garages.51 The park, which is known for being user friendly, has a very rigorous cleaning schedule with many areas being swept, wiped down or cleaned multiple times a day.5253 Although the park was unveiled in July 2004, some features opened earlier, and upgrades continued for some time afterwards.54 Along with the cultural features above ground (described below) the park has its own 2218-space parking garage.55
Jay Pritzker Pavilion

 The centerpiece of Millennium Park is the Jay Pritzker Pavilion,56 a bandshell designed by Frank Gehry. The pavilion has 4,000 fixed seats, plus additional lawn seating for 7,000;57 the stage is framed by curving plates of stainless steel, characteristic of Gehry. It was named after Jay Pritzker, whose family is known for owning Hyatt Hotels and was a major donor. The Pritzker Pavilion is Grant Park's outdoor performing arts venue for small events, and complements Petrillo Music Shell, the park's older and larger bandshell. The pavilion is built partially atop the Harris Theater for Music and Dance, the park's indoor performing arts venue, with which it shares a loading dock and backstage facilities.58 The pavilion is seen as a major upgrade from the Petrillo Music Shell for those events it hosts.59 Initially, the pavilion's lawn seats were free for all concerts, but this changed when Tori Amos performed the first rock concert there on August 31, 2005.60
The Pritzker Pavilion is the home of the Grant Park Symphony Orchestra and Chorus and the Grant Park Music Festival, the nation's only remaining free, municipally supported, outdoor, classical music series.61 The Festival is presented by the Chicago Park District and the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs.62 The Pavilion hosts a wide range of other music series and annual performing arts events.636465 Performers ranging from mainstream rock bands to classical musicians and opera singers have appeared at the pavilion,66 which also hosts physical fitness activities such as yoga.67 All rehearsals at the pavilion are open to the public; trained guides are available for the music festival rehearsals, which are well-attended.68
The construction of the pavilion created a legal controversy, given that there are historic limitations on the height of buildings in Grant Park. To avoid these legal restrictions, the city classifies the bandshell as a work of art rather than a building.69 With several design and assembly problems, the construction plans were revised over time, with features eliminated and others added as successful fundraising allowed the budget to grow.70 In the end, the performance venue was designed with a large fixed seating area, a Great Lawn, a trellis network to support the sound system, and a headdress fashioned from signature Gehry stainless steel.71 It features a sound system with an acoustic design that replicates an indoor concert hall sound experience.72 The pavilion and Millennium Park have received favorable recognition by critics, especially for their accessibility; an accessibility award ceremony held at the pavilion in 2005 described it as &quot;one of the most accessible parks&lt;U+2014&gt;not just in the United States but possibly the world&quot;.73
AT&amp;T Plaza and Cloud Gate

 The AT&amp;T Plaza is a public space that hosts the Cloud Gate sculpture.74 The plaza opened in July 2004 with the unveiling of the sculpture during the grand opening weekend of the park. Ameritech donated $3 million for the naming right for the plaza, but it was SBC Plaza when the park opened, as a merger had changed the company name to SBC Communications.7576 The 2005 merger of SBC and AT&amp;T led to the present name. The sculpture and the AT&amp;T Plaza are located on top of Park Grill, between the Chase Promenade and McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink. The plaza has become a place to view the McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink. During the holiday season, the plaza hosts Christmas caroling.77
Cloud Gate is a three-story steel sculpture that has been dubbed &quot;The Bean&quot; by Chicagoans, because of its legume-like shape. The sculpture is the first public artwork in the United States by world-renowned artist Anish Kapoor. The privately-funded piece cost $23 million, considerably more than the original estimate of $6 million. Composed of 168 stainless steel plates welded together, its highly-polished exterior has no visible seams. It is  and weighs .78
After Kapoor's design for the sculpture was selected during a design competition,79 numerous technological concerns regarding the design's construction and assembly arose,80818283 in addition to concerns regarding the sculpture's upkeep and maintenance.8485 Experts were consulted, some of whom believed the design could not be implemented.86 Eventually, a feasible method was found, but the sculpture's construction fell behind schedule. Cloud Gate was unveiled in an incomplete form during the Millennium Park grand opening celebration,87 as the grid of welds around each metal panel was still visible.88 The sculpture was concealed again while it was completed;8990 in early 2005, workers polished out the seams.91 Cloud Gate was formally dedicated on May 15, 2006,9293 and it has since gained considerable popularity, both domestically and internationally.9495969798
Cloud Gate is a reflective steel sculpture that is inspired by liquid mercury; the sculpture's surface reflects and distorts the city's skyline.99100 The curved, mirror-like surface of the sculpture provides striking reflections of visitors,101 the city skyline (particularly the historic Michigan Avenue &quot;streetwall&quot;) and the sky.102103 Visitors are able to walk around and under Cloud Gate's  high arch. On the underside is the &quot;omphalos&quot; (Greek for &quot;navel&quot;), a concave chamber that warps and multiplies reflections. The sculpture builds upon many of Kapoor's artistic themes and is popular with tourists as a photo-taking opportunity for its unique reflective properties.104105
Crown Fountain

 The Crown Fountain is an interactive work of public art and video sculpture, named in honor of Chicago's Crown family and designed by Catalan conceptual artist Jaume Plensa; it opened in July 2004.106107 The fountain is composed of a black granite reflecting pool placed between a pair of transparent glass brick towers. The towers are  tall,108 and use light-emitting diodes behind the bricks to display digital videos on their inward faces. Construction and design of the Crown Fountain cost $17 million.109
Weather permitting, the water operates from May to October,110 intermittently cascading down the two towers and spouting through a nozzle on each tower's front face. To achieve the effect in which water appears to be flowing from subjects' mouths, each video has a segment where the subject's lips are puckered, which is then timed to correspond to the spouting water, reminiscent of gargoyle fountains; this happens roughly every five minutes.111 The park and fountain are open to the public daily from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.112
Residents and critics have praised the fountain for its artistic and entertainment features.113114115 It highlights Plensa's themes of dualism, light, and water, extending the use of video technology from his prior works.116 The fountain promotes physical interaction between the public and the water in an artistic setting. Both the fountain and Millennium Park are highly accessible because of their universal design.117
The Crown Fountain has been the most controversial of all the Millennium Park features. Before it was built, some were concerned that the sculpture's height violated the aesthetic tradition of the park.118 After construction, surveillance cameras were installed atop the fountain, which led to a public outcry (and their quick removal).119120121 However, the fountain has survived its somewhat contentious beginnings to find its way into Chicago pop culture. It is a popular subject for photographers and a common gathering place. While some of the videos displayed are of scenery, most attention has focused on its video clips of local residents, in which almost a thousand Chicagoans randomly appear on two screens.122 The fountain is a public play area and offers people an escape from summer heat, allowing children to frolic in the fountain's water.123
Lurie Garden

 The Lurie Garden is a  public garden located at the southern end of Millennium Park; designed by Kathryn Gustafson, Piet Oudolf, and Robert Israel, it opened on July 16, 2004.124 The garden is a combination of perennials, bulbs, grasses, shrubs and trees.125 It is the featured nature component of the world's largest green roof. The garden cost $13.2 million and has a $10 million financial endowment for maintenance and upkeep.126127 It was named after philanthropist Ann Lurie, who donated the $10 million endowment.128129 The garden is a tribute to the city, whose motto is &quot;Urbs in Horto&quot;, Latin for &quot;City in a Garden&quot;.130 The Lurie Garden is composed of two &quot;plates&quot;. The dark plate depicts Chicago's history by presenting shade-loving plants, and has a combination of trees that will provide a shade canopy for these plants when they fill in. The light plate, which has no trees, represents the city's future with sun-loving perennials that thrive in heat and light.131
McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink and Park Grill

 The McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink is a multipurpose venue located along the western edge of Millennium Park opposite the streetwall of the Historic Michigan Boulevard District. On December 20, 2001, it became the first attraction in Millennium Park to open,132133 a few weeks ahead of the Millennium Park underground parking garage.134 The $3.2 million plaza was funded by a donation from the McCormick Tribune Foundation.135 For four months a year, it operates as McCormick Tribune Ice Rink, a free public outdoor ice skating rink.136 It is generally open for skating from mid-November until mid-March and hosts over 100,000 skaters annually. It is known as one of Chicago's better outdoor people watching locations during the winter months.137138 The rink is operated by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs rather than the Chicago Park District,139140 which operates most major public ice skating rinks in Chicago.141
For the rest of the year, it serves as The Plaza at Park Grill or Park Grill Plaza, Chicago's largest al fresco dining facility.142 The 150-seat outdoor restaurant offers scenic views of the park, and hosts various culinary events and musical performances during its months of operation.143144 From June 21 to September 15, 2002, the plaza served as an open-air exhibition space and hosted the inaugural exhibit in Millennium Park, Exelon Presents Earth From Above by Yann Arthus-Bertrand, a French aerial photographer.145
The Park Grill Plaza is affiliated with the 300-seat indoor Park Grill restaurant, located beneath the AT&amp;T Plaza and Cloud Gate. The Park Grill is the only full-service restaurant in Millennium Park and opened on November 24, 2003.146 It regularly places among the leaders in citywide best-of competitions for best burger,147148149150151 and it is widely praised for its views.152153154155 The restaurant has been the focus of controversies about the numerous associates of Mayor Daley who are investors, its exclusive location and lucrative contract terms. One of the most financially successful restaurants in Chicago, the Park Grill remains exempt from property taxes after a multi-year litigation which reached the appellate courts in Illinois.156157158
BP Pedestrian Bridge

 The BP Pedestrian Bridge is a girder footbridge over Columbus Drive that connects Millennium Park with Daley Bicentennial Plaza, both parts of the larger Grant Park. The pedestrian bridge is the first bridge Gehry designed to be built, and was named for BP plc, which donated $5 million to the construction of the park.159160 It opened on July 16, 2004, along with the rest of Millennium Park.161 Gehry had been courted by the city to design the bridge and the neighboring Jay Pritzker Pavilion, and eventually agreed to do so after the Pritzker family funded the Pavilion.162163164 The bridge is known for its aesthetics, and Gehry's style is seen in its biomorphic allusions and extensive sculptural use of stainless steel plates to express abstraction. The bridge is referred to as snakelike in character due to its curving form.165 The bridge's design, which meets highway standards to accommodate rushes of pedestrian traffic simultaneously exiting Pritzker Pavilion events,166 enables it to bear a heavy load.167
The pedestrian bridge serves as a noise barrier for the pavilion, blocking traffic sounds from Columbus Drive. It is a connecting link between Millennium Park and destinations to the east, such as the nearby lakefront, other parts of Grant Park and a parking garage.168 The BP Bridge uses a concealed box girder design with a concrete base, and its deck is covered by hardwood floor boards.169 It is designed without handrails, using stainless steel parapets instead.170 The total length is , with a five percent slope on its inclined surfaces that makes it barrier-free and accessible.171172 It has won awards for its use of sheet metal.173174 Although the bridge is closed in winter because ice cannot be safely removed from its wooden walkway, it has received favorable reviews for its design and aesthetics.175
Harris Theater

 The Joan W. and Irving B. Harris Theater for Music and Dance is a 1525-seat theater for the performing arts located along the northern edge of Millennium Park. Constructed in 2002&lt;U+2013&gt;03, it is the city's premier performance venue for small- and medium-sized performance groups,176 which had previously been without a permanent home and were underserved by the city's performing venue options.177 The theater, which is largely underground due to Grant Park-related height restrictions, was named for its primary benefactors, Joan and Irving Harris.178 It serves as the park's indoor performing venue, a compliment to Jay Pritzker Pavilion, which hosts the park's outdoor performances. Among the regularly featured local groups are the Joffrey Ballet, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago and Chicago Opera Theater.179 It provides subsidized rental, technical expertise, and marketing support for the companies using it,180 and turned a profit in its fourth fiscal year.181
The Harris Theater has hosted notable national and international performers, such as the New York City Ballet, which made its first visit to Chicago in over 25 years (in 2006). The theater began offering subscription series of traveling performers in its 2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09 fifth anniversary season.182183184 Performances through this series have included the San Francisco Ballet,185 Mikhail Baryshnikov, and Stephen Sondheim.186
The theater has been credited as contributing to the performing arts renaissance in Chicago,187 and it has been favorably reviewed for its acoustics, sightlines, proscenium and for providing a home base for numerous performing organizations.188189190 Although it is seen as a high-caliber venue for its music audiences, the theater is regarded as less than ideal for jazz groups, because it is more expensive and larger than most places where jazz is performed.191 The design has been criticized for traffic flow problems, with an elevator bottleneck.192193 However, the theater's prominent location and its underground design to preserve Millennium Park have been praised.194 Although there were complaints about high-priced events in its early years, discounted ticket programs were introduced in the 2009&lt;U+2013&gt;10 season.195
Wrigley Square

 Wrigley Square is a public square located in the northwest corner of Millennium Park near the intersection of East Randolph Street and North  Michigan, across from the Historic Michigan Boulevard District.196 It contains the Millennium Monument, a nearly full-sized replica of the semicircle of paired Greek Doric-style columns (called a peristyle) that originally sat in this area of Grant Park between 1917 and 1953.197 The square also contains a large lawn and a public fountain. The William Wrigley, Jr. Foundation contributed $5 million for the monument and square, which was named in its honor.198 The pedestal of the Millennium Monument's peristyle is inscribed with the names of the 115 financial donors who made the 91 contributions of at least $1 million each to help pay for Millennium Park.199
McDonald's Cycle Center

 The McDonald's Cycle Center is a 300-space heated and air conditioned indoor bike station located in the northeast corner of Millennium Park. The facility provides lockers, showers, a snack bar with outdoor summer seating, bike repair, bike rental and other amenities for downtown bicycle commuters and utility cyclists. The bike station also accommodates runners and in-line skaters,200201202 and provides space for a Chicago Police Department Bike Patrol Group.203 The city-built center opened in July 2004 as the Millennium Park Bike Station; since June 2006, it has been sponsored by McDonald's and several other partners, including city departments and bicycle advocacy organizations.204205 Suburban Chicago-based McDonald's sponsorship of the Cycle Center fit in well with its efforts to help its customers become more healthy by encouraging &quot;balanced, active lifestyles&quot;.206 The Cycle Center is accessible by membership and day pass.207
Planning for the Cycle Center was part of the larger &quot;Bike 2010 Plan&quot;, in which the city aimed to make itself more accommodating to bicycle commuters. This plan (since replaced by the &quot;Bike 2015 Plan&quot;)208 included provisions for front-mounted two-bike carriers on Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses, permitting bikes to be carried on Chicago 'L' trains, installing numerous bike racks and creating bicycle lanes in streets throughout the city.209 Additionally, the Chicago metropolitan area's other mass transit providers, Metra and Pace, have developed increased bike accessibility.210 Mayor Daley was an advocate of the plan, noting it is also an environmentally friendly effort to cut down on traffic.211212 Environmentalists, urban planners and cycling enthusiasts around the world have expressed interest in the Cycle Center, and want to emulate what they see as a success story in urban planning and transit-oriented development.213214215216 Pro-cycling and environmentalist journalists in publications well beyond Chicago have described the Cycle Center as exemplary, impressive, unique and ground-breaking.217218 The Toronto Star notes that it is revered as &quot;as a kind of Shangri-La&quot;, and describes it as &quot;a jewel-like glass building on the Chicago waterfront, [that] has many of the amenities of an upscale health club [...] close to the heart of the city,&quot; with the additional statement that &quot;It's not heaven, but it's close&quot;.219 A Vancouver official told The Oregonian that it was &quot;the ultimate in bicycle stations&quot;, and would be natural for bicycle friendly cities to emulate.220
Exelon Pavilions

 The Exelon Pavilions are a set of four solar energy-generating structures in Millennium Park. The pavilions provide sufficient energy to power the equivalent of 14 Energy star-rated energy-efficient houses in Chicago.221 The pavilions were designed in January 2001 and construction began in January 2004. The Southeast and Southwest Exelon Pavilions (jointly the South Exelon Pavilions) along Madison Street were completed and opened in July 2004, and flank the Lurie Garden. The Northeast and Northwest Exelon Pavilions (jointly the North Exelon Pavilions) flank the Harris Theater along Randolph Street and were completed in November 2004, with a grand opening on April 30, 2005.222 Besides producing energy, three of the four pavilions provide access to the park's underground parking garages and the fourth serves as the park's welcome center.223 Exelon, a company that generates the electricity transmitted by its subsidiary Commonwealth Edison,224 donated approximately $6 million for the pavilions.225
Boeing Galleries

 The Boeing Galleries are a pair of outdoor exhibition spaces within Millennium Park; they are located along the south and north mid-level terraces, above and east of Wrigley Square and the Crown Fountain.226 They were added after the park opened; in March 2005, Boeing President and Chief Executive Officer James Bell announced the firm would make a $5 million grant to fund construction of the spaces, and for an endowment to &quot;help fund visual arts exhibitions&quot; in them.227 The galleries, which were built between March and June 2005,228 have hosted grand-scale art exhibits, some of which have run for two full summers.
Chase Promenade

 The Chase Promenade is an open-air tree-lined pedestrian walkway in Millennium Park that opened July 16, 2004. The promenade was made possible by a gift from the Bank One Foundation;229 Bank One merged with JPMorgan Chase in 2004, and the name became Chase Promenade. The  walkway accommodates exhibitions, festivals and other family events.230 It also serves as a private-event rental venue.231 The Chase Promenade hosted the 2009 Burnham Pavilions, which were the cornerstone of the citywide Burnham Plan centennial celebration.232
Nichols Bridgeway

 The Nichols Bridgeway, a pedestrian bridge that opened on May 16, 2009, connects the south end of Millennium Park with the Modern Wing of the Art Institute of Chicago. The bridge begins at the southwest end of the Jay Pritzker Pavilion's Great Lawn and extends across Monroe Street, where it connects to the third floor of the Art Institute's West Pavilion.233234 The bridge design by Renzo Piano, the architect of the Modern Wing, was inspired by the hull of a boat.235
The Nichols Bridgeway is approximately  long and  wide. The bottom of the bridge is made of white, painted structural steel, the floor is made of aluminum planking and the  tall railings are steel set atop stainless steel mesh. The bridge features anti-slip walkways and heating elements to prevent the formation of ice. It meets standards for universal accessibility, as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). The bridge is named after museum donors Alexandra and John Nichols.236
Budget
During development and construction of the park, many structures were added, redesigned or modified. These changes often resulted in budget increases. For example, the bandshell's proposed budget was $10.8 million. When the elaborate, cantilevered Gehry design required extra pilings to be driven into the bedrock to support the added weight, the cost of the bandshell eventually spiraled to $60.3 million. The cost of the park, as itemized in the following table, amounted to almost $500 million.237
Mayor Daley at first placed much of the blame for the delay and cost overrun on Frank Gehry, who designed the pavilion and its connecting bridge; Daley's office later apologized to the architect.238 A 2001 investigative report by the Chicago Tribune described the park then under construction and its budget overruns as an &quot;expensive public-works debacle that can be traced to haphazard planning, design snafus and cronyism&quot;.239 According to Lois Weisberg, commissioner of the Department of Cultural Affairs, and James Law, executive director of the Mayor's Office of Special Events, once the full scope of the project was finalized the project was completed within the revised budget.240

Use
Millennium Park had 3 million visitors in its first year; annual attendance was projected to grow to between 3.31 and 3.65 million by 2010.242 According to Crain's Chicago Business, however, the park had about 4 million visitors in 2009.243 In addition to the different uses detailed for each of the permanent features (above), the park has hosted some other notable events, including the annual Grant Park Music Festival, and two temporary pavilions to mark the centennial of Daniel Burnham's 1909 Plan of Chicago. Millennium Park has also been featured in several films and television shows.
Grant Park Music Festival

 The Grant Park Music Festival (formerly Grant Park Concerts) is an annual 10-week classical music concert series,244 which features the Grant Park Symphony Orchestra and the Grant Park Chorus as well as guest performers and conductors.245 Since 2004, the festival has been housed in the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park.246 On occasion, the festival has been held at the Harris Theater instead of the Pritzker Pavilion.247248 The festival has earned non-profit organization status,249 and claims to be the nation's only free, outdoor classical music series.250
The Grant Park Music Festival has been a Chicago tradition since 1931, when Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak suggested free concerts to lift spirits of Chicagoans during the Great Depression.251252 The tradition of symphonic Grant Park Music Festival concerts began in 1935. The 2004 season, during which the festival moved to the Pritzker Pavilion, was the event's 70th season.253 Formerly, the Grant Park Music Festival was held at the Petrillo Music Shell in Grant Park.254
Over time the festival has had various financial supporters, three primary locations and one name change. At times it has been broadcast nationally on the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) and Columbia Broadcasting Service (CBS) radio networks, and many of the world's leading classical musicians have performed there.255 In 2000, the festival organizers agreed to release some of the concerts to the public via compact disc recordings.256
2009 Burnham Pavilions

 In 2009, architects Zaha Hadid and Ben van Berkel were invited to design and build two pavilions on the Chase Promenade South, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Daniel Burnham&lt;U+2019&gt;s 1909 Plan of Chicago. The pavilions were privately funded257258 and were designed to be temporary structures.259 They served as the focal point of Chicago's year-long celebration of Burnham's Plan, and were meant to symbolize the city's continued pursuit of the plan's architectural vision.260
The van Berkel Pavilion was composed of two parallel rectangular planes joined by curving scoops, all built on a steel frame covered with glossy white plywood.261 It was situated on a raised platform, which was sliced by a ramp entrance, making it ADA accessible.262 The Hadid Pavilion was a tensioned fabric shell fitted over a curving aluminum framework made of more than 7,000 pieces. A centennial-themed video presentation was projected on its interior fabric walls after dark.263
Both pavilions were scheduled to be unveiled on June 19, 2009. However, Hadid's pavilion was not ready in time; it had construction delays and a construction team change, which led to coverage of the delay in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.264265 Only its aluminum skeleton was available for public viewing on the scheduled date; the work was completed and unveiled on August 4, 2009. The van Berkel pavilion was temporarily closed for repairs August 10&lt;U+2013&gt;14, due to unanticipated wear and tear.266 Both pavilions were dismantled after November 1, 2009; the materials from van Berkel's were recycled, while Hadid's was stored for possible exhibition elsewhere.267
In popular culture
Jeff Garlin claims that I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With was the first Hollywood movie to incorporate Millennium Park.268 The film was not released until 2006, after the release of several other movies. These include the 2005 film The Weather Man, which starred Nicolas Cage and was filmed in part at the park's McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink.269 The 2006 romantic comedy The Break-Up shot scenes in the park, then had to reshoot some of them because Cloud Gate was under cover in some of the initial shots.270 Other movies which include scenes filmed in Millennium Park include the 2005 thriller Derailed,271 the 2006 romance The Lake House,272 and the 2007 thriller Butterfly on a Wheel.273 At least two television series have filmed in the park, including Leverage274 and Prison Break, which featured shots of the Crown Fountain in the first few episodes of its first season (2005).275
Criticism and controversy
Height restrictions
 In 1836, a year before Chicago was incorporated,276 the Board of Canal Commissioners held public auctions for the city's first lots. Foresighted citizens, who wanted the lakefront kept as public open space, convinced the commissioners to designate the land east of Michigan Avenue between Randolph Street and Park Row (11th Street) &quot;Public Ground&lt;U+2014&gt;A Common to Remain Forever Open, Clear and Free of Any Buildings, or Other Obstruction, whatever.&quot;277 Grant Park has been &quot;forever open, clear and free&quot; since, protected by legislation that has been affirmed by four previous Illinois Supreme Court rulings.278279280281 In 1839, United States Secretary of War Joel Roberts Poinsett declared the land between Randolph Street and Madison Street east of Michigan Avenue &quot;Public Ground forever to remain vacant of buildings&quot;.282
Aaron Montgomery Ward, who is known both as the inventor of mail order and the protector of Grant Park, twice sued the city of Chicago to force it to remove buildings and structures from Grant Park and to keep it from building new ones.283284 In 1890, arguing that Michigan Avenue property owners held easements on the park land, Ward commenced legal actions to keep the park free of new buildings. In 1900, the Illinois Supreme Court concluded that all landfill east of Michigan Avenue was subject to dedications and easements.285 In 1909, when Ward sought to prevent the construction of the Field Museum of Natural History in the center of the park, the courts affirmed his arguments.286287
As a result, the city has what are termed Montgomery Ward height restrictions on buildings and structures in Grant Park. However, the Crown Fountain and the  Pritzker Pavilion were exempt from the height restrictions, because they were classified as works of art and not buildings or structures.288289 According to The Economist, the pavilion is described as a work of art to dodge the protections established by Ward, who is said to continue to rule and protect Grant Park from his grave.290 The Harris Theater, which is adjacent to Pritzker Pavilion, was built almost entirely underground to avoid the height restrictions.291 The height of the Crown Fountain, which is also exempted as a work of art, has been described as stemming from a &quot;pissing contest&quot; with other park feature artists.292293
Financial issues
The Millennium Park project has been the subject of some criticism since its inception. In addition to concerns about cost overruns, individuals and organizations have complained that the money spent on the park might have gone to other worthy causes, citing poverty in Chicago and problems in the city's schools. Although the park's design and architectural elements have won wide praise, there has been some criticism of its aesthetics. Other criticism has revolved around the larger issue of corruption and political favoritism in the city; The New York Times reported in July 2004 that an inflated contract for park cleanup had gone to a company that made large contributions to Mayor Daley's election campaign.294 The park's only full service restaurant, Park Grill, has been criticized for its connection to numerous friends and associates of the mayor.295296  Concerns have also been raised over the mixed use of taxpayer and corporate funding and associated naming rights for sections of the park. While a monument in Wrigley Square honors the park's many private and corporate donors, many park features are also named for their corporate underwriters, with the sponsors' names prominently indicated with stone markers (The Boeing Gallery, The Exelon Pavilion, The AT&amp;T Plaza, The Wrigley Square). Some critics have deemed this to be inappropriate for a public space. Julie Deardorff, Chicago Tribune health and fitness reporter, described the naming of the McDonald's Cycle Center as a continuation of the &quot; 'McDonaldization' of America&quot; and as somewhat &quot;insidious&quot; because the company is making itself more prominent as the social sentiment is to move away from fast food.297 Timothy Gilfoyle, author of Millennium Park: Creating a Chicago Landmark, notes that a controversy surrounds the &quot;tasteless&quot; corporate naming of several of the Park's features, including the BP Bridge, named for an oil company.298 Naming rights were sold for high fees,299 and Gilfoyle was not the only one who chastised park officials for selling naming rights to the highest bidder. Public interest groups have crusaded against commercialization of Chicago parks.300 However, many of the donors have a long history of local philanthropy and their funds were essential to provide necessary financing for several park features.301
Ticket prices for both the Harris Theater and the Pritzker Pavilion have been controversial. John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune notes that the theater's size poses a challenge to performers attempting to fill its seats, and feels that it overemphasizes high-priced events.302 In 2009&lt;U+2013&gt;2010, the theater introduced two discounted ticket programs:303 a $5 lunchtime series of 45-minute dance performances,304 and a $10 ticket program for in-person, cash-only purchases in the last 90 minutes before performances.305 Once the pavilion was built, the initial plan was that the lawn seating would be free for all events. An early brochure for the Grant Park Music Festival said &quot;You never need a ticket to attend a concert! The lawn and the general seating section are always admission free.&quot;306 However, when parking garage revenue fell short of estimates during the first year, the city charged $10 for lawn seating at the August 31, 2005, concert by Tori Amos.307 Amos, a classically trained musician who chose only piano and organ accompaniment for her concert, earned positive reviews as the inaugural rock and roll performer in a venue that regularly hosts classical music.308309 The city justified the charge by contending that since the pavilion is an open air venue, there were many places in Millennium Park where people could have enjoyed the music or the atmosphere of the park without having to pay.310311312
Use restrictions
When Millennium Park first opened in 2004, Metra police stopped a Columbia College Chicago journalism student working on a photography project, and confiscated his film because of fears of terrorism.313 In 2005, Cloud Gate attracted some controversy when a professional photographer without a paid permit was denied access to the piece.314 As is the case for all works of art currently covered by United States copyright law, the artist holds the copyright for the sculpture. The public may freely photograph Cloud Gate, but permission from Kapoor or the City of Chicago (which has licensed the art) is required for any commercial reproductions of the photographs. Initially the city charged photographers permit fees of $350 per day for professional still photographers, $1,200 per day for professional videographers and $50 per hour for wedding photographers. The policy has been changed so permits are only required for large-scale film, video and photography requiring 10-person crews.315
Almost all of Millennium Park was closed for a day for corporate events in 2005 and 2006. Closing a public park partly paid for with taxpayer money was controversial,316 as was the exclusion of commuters who walk through the park and tourists lured by its attractions.317 On September 8, 2005, Toyota Motor Sales USA paid $800,000 to rent all park venues from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m, except Wrigley Square, the Lurie Garden, the McDonald's Cycle Center and the Crown Fountain.318319 The city said the money was used to fund day-to-day operations, and for free events in the park,320 including the Lurie Garden Festival, a Steppenwolf Theater production, musical performers along the Chase Promenade all summer long, a jazz series, and children's concerts.321 The name of Toyota, one of the sponsors, was included on Millennium Park brochures, web site, and advertising signage.322 The closure provided a public relations opportunity for General Motors, which shuttled 1,500 tourists from the park to see other Chicago attractions.323 Toyota said it considered $300,000 a rental expense and $500,000 a sponsoring donation. On August 7, 2006, Allstate, which paid $200,000 as a rental expense and $500,000 as a sponsoring donation, acquired the visitation rights to a different set of park features, and only had exclusive access to certain features after 4 p.m.324
The park is closed from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. daily.325 Chicago is a dog-friendly city with a half dozen dog beaches,326 however the city does not permit dogs in the park. Only on-duty service dogs for the disabled or visually impaired are permitted.327
Surveillance cameras
In November 2006, the Crown Fountain became the focus of a public controversy when the city added surveillance cameras atop each tower. Purchased with a $52 million Department of Homeland Security grant, the cameras augmented eight others covering all of Millennium Park.328 City officials had consulted the architects who collaborated with Plensa on the tower designs, but not Plensa himself.329 Public reaction was negative, as bloggers and the artistic community decried the cameras as inappropriate and a blight on the towers.330331 The city said that the cameras would be replaced with permanent, less intrusive models in several months;332 it contended that the cameras, similar to those used throughout Chicago in high-crime areas and at traffic intersections, had been added largely for security reasons but also partly to help park officials monitor burnt-out LED lights on the fountain.333 The Chicago Tribune published an article on the cameras and the public reaction; the cameras were removed the next day, with Plensa's support.334
Reception and recognition
The Financial Times describes Millennium Park as &quot;an extraordinary public park that is set to create new iconic images of the city&quot;, and further notes that it is &quot;a genuinely 21st-century interactive park [that] could trigger a new way of thinking about public outdoor spaces&quot;.335 Time magazine views both Cloud Gate and the Jay Pritzker Pavilion as part of a well-planned visit to Chicago.336 Frommer's lists exploring Millennium Park as one of the four best free things to do in the city,337 and it commends the park for its various artistic offerings.338 Lonely Planet recommends an hour-long stroll to see the park's playful art.339 The park is praised as a &quot;showcase of art and urban design&quot; by the San Francisco Chronicle,340 while Time refers to it as an &quot;artfully re-arranged [...] civic phantasmagoria like Antonio Gaudi's Park G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ell in Barcelona, with the difference that this one is the product of an ensemble of creative spirits&quot;.341 The book 1,000 Places to See in the U.S.A. &amp; Canada Before You Die describes Millennium Park as a renowned attraction.342

The park was designed to be accessible; it only needs a single wheelchair lift and its accessibility won its project director the 2005 Barrier-Free America Award.343 The McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink and the Jay Pritzker Pavilion both provide accessible restrooms.344 The park opened with 78 women's toilet fixtures and 45 for men, with heated facilities on the east side of the Pritzker Pavilion. It also had about six dozen park benches designed by Kathryn Gustafson, the landscape architect responsible for the Lurie Garden.345 In 2005, the park won the Green Roof Award of Excellence in the Intensive Industrial/Commercial category from Green Roofs for Healthy Cities (GRHC).346 GRHC considers the park to be one of the largest green roofs in the world; it covers &quot;a structural deck supported by two reinforced concrete cast-in-place garages and steel structures that span over the remaining railroad tracks&quot;.347348 In 2005 the park also received Travel + Leisure's Design Award for &quot;Best Public Space&quot;, and the American Public Works Association's &quot;Project of the Year&quot; Award. In its first year, the park, its features and associated people received over 30 awards.349
Mayors from other cities have admired the park as an example of successful urban planning. The mayor of Shanghai enjoyed his visit to the park,350 and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom wished his city could create a similar type of civic amenity.351352 Closer to home, Blair Kamin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic for the Chicago Tribune, concluded his 2004 review of Millennium Park with the following: &quot;...a park provides a respite from the city, yet it also reflects the city. In that sense, all of Millennium Park mirrors the rebirth of Chicago ... the ambition of its patrons, the creativity of its artists and architects, and the ongoing miracle of its ability to transform a no place into a someplace that's extraordinary.&quot;353
