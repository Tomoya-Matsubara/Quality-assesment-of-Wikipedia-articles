&lt;U+201C&gt;Valzhyna Mort&lt;U+201D&gt; (born Valzhyna Martynava, 1981, Minsk, Belarus) is an Belarusian poet who now lives in the United States. Her first book of poetry, I'm as Thin as Your Eyelashes, came out in Belarus in 2005. In 2004 in Slovenia she received a Crystal Vilencia Award for best poetry performance. She was the recipient, in 2005, of a Gaude Polonia scholarship in Poland, and, in 2006, of a writing fellowship from Literarisches Colloquium Berlin, Germany. Her first American publication, Factory of Tears (Copper Canyon Press, 2008), the first Belarusian/English poetry book published in the U.S., was co-translated from the Belarusian by Elizabeth Oehlkers Wright and Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Franz Wright. The poems juxtapose youthful coming-of-age to the struggles of a nation&lt;U+2019&gt;s emergent vitality.1
Mort studied at the State University of Linguistics in Minsk. Known throughout Europe for her live performances, Mort works explicitly to reestablish a clear identity for Belarus and its language.2 Mort is the youngest poet to be featured on the cover of Poetry &amp; Writers magazine.3
