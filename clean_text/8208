Priyanka Chopra (; born 18 July 1982) is an Indian film actress, singer, and songwriter. The winner of the Miss World pageant of 2000, through her successful film career Chopra has become one of Bollywood's highest-paid actresses and one of the most popular celebrities in India. She has won a National Film Award for Best Actress and Filmfare Awards in four categories.
Chopra was born in Jamshedpur to parents who were both physicians in the Indian Army, causing the family to move frequently during her childhood, but she considers Bareilly her real home. As a teenager she lived for some years with an aunt in the United States. In 2000, her mother entered her into the Femina Miss India contest, in which she finished second and took the Miss India World title. She was then entered into the Miss World pageant, where she was crowned Miss World 2000 and Miss World Continental Queen of BeautyAsia &amp; Oceania, becoming the fifth Indian to win the competition.
Although Chopra at one time aspired to study engineering or psychiatry, she accepted offers to join the Indian film industry, which came as a result of her pageant wins, making her acting debut in the Tamil film Thamizhan in 2002. The following year, she starred in The Hero, her first Hindi film release, and followed it with the box-office hit Andaaz, which won her the Filmfare Best Female Debut Award and a nomination for the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award. She subsequently earned wide critical recognition for the role of a seductress in the 2004 thriller Aitraaz, winning her the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role. By 2006, Chopra had established herself as a leading actress of Hindi cinema with starring roles in the highly successful films Krrish and Don. After receiving mixed reviews for a series of unsuccessful films, she received critical acclaim for her portrayal of unconventional characters, including a troubled model in the 2008 drama Fashion, a feisty Marathi woman in the 2009 caper thriller Kaminey, a serial killer in the 2011 neo-noir 7 Khoon Maaf, and an autistic woman in the 2012 romantic comedy Barfi!
In addition to acting in films, she participates in stage shows, has hosted a reality show on television, and has written columns for India's national newspapers. Chopra has engaged in philanthropic activities, and was appointed as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for Child Rights on 10 August 2010. In 2012, she released her first single &quot;In My City&quot;, which, although a commercial success in India, was met with mixed reactions from the critics.
Early life and background
Priyanka Chopra was born on 18 July 1982 in Jamshedpur, Bihar (now in Jharkhand), to Ashok and Madhu Chopra, both physicians in the Indian Army.12 Her father was Punjabi, while her mother is from Jharkhand.3 She has a brother, Siddharth, who is seven years her junior.4 Her cousins include actresses Parineeti Chopra, Meera Chopra, and Barbie Handa.56 Due to her parents' occupations the family relocated to a number of Indian cities, including Delhi, Pune, Lucknow, Bareilly, Ladakh, Chandigarh and Ambala.7 Among the schools she attended were La Martiniere Girls' School in Lucknow8 and St. Maria Goretti College in Bareilly.910 In an interview published in Daily News and Analysis, Chopra said that she did not mind travelling regularly and changing schools; she welcomed it as a new experience and a way to discover India's multicultural society.11 Among the many places that she lived, Chopra has fond memories as a child of playing in the valleys of Leh, in the cold northwestern Indian desert region of Jammu and Kashmir. She has said, &quot;I think I was in Class 4 when I was in Leh. My brother was just born. My dad was in the army and was posted there. I stayed in Leh for a year and my memories of that place are tremendous ... We were all army kids there. We weren't living in houses, we were in bunkers in the valley and there was a stupa right on top of a hill which used to overlook our valley. We used to race up to the top of the stupa&quot;.12 She now considers Bareilly her home town, and maintains strong connections there.13
At the age of thirteen, Chopra moved to the United States to study, living with her aunt, and attending schools in Newton, Massachusetts, and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, after a stop in Queens, New York, as her aunt's family also moved frequently.1415 While in Massachusetts, she participated in several theatre productions and studied Western classical music, choral singing and Kathak dance.16 Chopra was the only Indian in her class to have been selected at state level for the National Opus Honour Choir.17 However, by sophomore year, she was keen on becoming a software engineer or a criminal psychologist, rather than a performer.18 During her teenage years in America, Chopra sometimes faced racial issues and bullying. She has said, &quot;I was a gawky kid, had low self-esteem, came from a modest middle-class background, had white marks on my legs ... But I was damn hard working. Today, my legs sell 12 brands.&quot;19
After three years, Chopra returned to India, finishing the senior year2021 of her high-school education at the Army Public School in Bareilly.2223 During this period, she won the local &quot;May Queen&quot; beauty pageant,24 after which she was pursued by admirers, leading her family to equip their home with bars for her protection.25 Her mother then entered her in the Femina Miss India contest of 2000;26 she finished second, winning the Femina Miss India World title.27 Chopra then went on to the Miss World pageant, where she was crowned Miss World 2000 and Miss World Continental Queen of BeautyAsia &amp; Oceania at the Millennium Dome in London on 1 December 2000.282930 Chopra was the fifth Indian contestant to win Miss World, and the fourth to do so in seven years.3132 She had enrolled in college, but left after winning the Miss World pageant.3334 Chopra said that the Miss India and Miss World titles brought her recognition, and she then began receiving offers for film roles.3536
Chopra has maintained a strong relationship with her family, including her younger brother, Siddharth, and lives in an apartment on the same floor as her family.3738 She was especially close to her father, who died in June 2013;39 in 2012 she got a tattoo reading &quot;Daddy's lil girl&quot;, in his handwriting.4041 Having not come from a film background, she describes herself as a self-made woman.42 Her mother, a well-established gynaecologist in Bareilly, gave up her practice to support Chopra as she embarked upon a film career.4344
Acting career
Debut and breakthrough (2002&lt;U+2013&gt;04)
After winning Miss India World, Chopra was cast as the female lead in Abbas-Mustan's romantic thriller Humraaz (2002), in which she was to make her film debut.45 However, this fell through for various reasons: she stated the production conflicted with her schedule, while the producers said they re-cast because Chopra took on various other commitments.4647 Her screen debut occurred in the 2002 Tamil film Thamizhan as the love interest of the protagonist, played by Vijay. The film was praised for its wit and dialogue, although Chopra's character was seen as lacking in depth;48 Indian news and entertainment portal Rediff.com asserted that she showed &quot;no promise&quot;.49
In 2003, Chopra made her Bollywood film debut as the second female lead opposite Sunny Deol and Preity Zinta in Anil Sharma's The Hero: Love Story of a Spy.50 Set against the backdrop of the Indian Army in Kashmir, the film tells the story of an agent and his fight against terrorism. The Hero was one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films that year, but received mixed reviews from critics.5152 Later that year she appeared in Raj Kanwar's box-office success Andaaz with Akshay Kumar, again sharing the female lead (this time with the debuting Lara Dutta).53 Chopra played a vivacious young girl who falls in love with Kumar's character. Her performance earned her the Filmfare Best Female Debut Award (along with Dutta) and a nomination for the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award.54 The Hindustan Times noted the glamour that she brought to the role;55 Kunal Shah of Sify praised her and stated she had &quot;all the qualities to be a star.&quot;56
Chopra's first three releases in 2004&lt;U+2014&gt;Plan, Kismat, and Asambhav&lt;U+2014&gt;performed poorly at the box-office.57 Chopra was typically cast during this earlier period as a &quot;glamour quotient&quot;, in roles that were considered &quot;forgettable&quot; by film critic Joginder Tuteja.5859 Later that year she starred with Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar in David Dhawan's romantic comedy Mujhse Shaadi Karogi, which became the third-highest-grossing film of the year in India and emerged as a commercial success earning  globally.60 In late 2004, she starred opposite Kumar and Kareena Kapoor in Abbas-Mustan's thriller Aitraaz. Chopra considers her first role as an antagonist, portraying Soniya Roy, an ambitious woman who accuses her employee of sexual harassment, as the &quot;biggest learning experience of her career.&quot;61 The film was moderately successful at the Indian box-office,62 and Chopra's performance was critically acclaimed.63 Author Rini Bhattacharya credited her for bringing back the seductress to the silver screen.6465 The Hindustan Times cited it as the film that changed her career significantly.66 A reviewer writing for the BBC said, &quot;Aitraaz is Priyanka Chopra's film. As the deliciously wicked, gold digging, scheming seductress, she chews up every scene she is in with her magnetic screen presence.&quot;67 She earned a Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role (also known as the Best Villain Award),68 becoming the second and final actress to win the award after Kajol (the category was discontinued in 2008). Chopra also received another nomination for the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award for her performance.69
Early success and setbacks (2005&lt;U+2013&gt;08)
In 2005, Chopra appeared in six films. Three of them&lt;U+2014&gt;Blackmail, Karam and Yakeen&lt;U+2014&gt;were commercially unsuccessful.70 Shilpa Bharatan-Iyer of Rediff.com considered Blackmail to be a very predictable film and believed that her role as a police commissioner's wife was very limited from an acting viewpoint.71 On her performance in Yakeen, Taran Adarsh wrote that Chopra &quot;is bound to win laurels yet again ... the actor is emerging as one of the finest talents in these fast-changing times&quot;.72 Chopra played the wife of Akshay Kumar in Vipul Amrutlal Shah's family drama Waqt: The Race Against Time, the story of a small businessman (played by Amitabh Bachchan) who, hiding his illness, wants to teach his irresponsible son some lessons before he dies. During production, Chopra revisited Leh, a favourite childhood haunt, for the shooting of the song &quot;Subah Hogi&quot;.73 She suffered an accident during the filming for the song &quot;Do Me A Favour Let's Play Holi&quot; when she electrocuted herself, spending a day recovering in hospital. The film was a moderate box-office success.7475 Her next release was Suneel Darshan's romance Barsaat, co-starring Bobby Deol and Bipasha Basu. The film was a critical and commercial failure in India76 but fared better in the overseas market.77 Chopra's performance received mixed reviews, with Taran Adarsh describing it as &quot;mechanical&quot;.78 However, Rediff.com considered Chopra to be an &quot;epitome of calm intelligence, who underplayed her role to perfection&quot;.79 Later that year, Rohan Sippy cast her with Abhishek Bachchan, Ritesh Deshmukh and Nana Patekar in the comedy Bluffmaster! Chopra played independent working woman Simran Saxena (Bachchan's love interest). According to critic Subhash K. Jha, &quot;Chopra has little to do. But she does it with eye-catching aplomb.&quot;80
 After starting 2006 with special appearances in three films, Chopra starred in Rakesh Roshan's superhero film Krrish (a sequel to the 2003 science-fiction film Koi... Mil Gaya). Co-starring with Hrithik Roshan, Rekha and Naseeruddin Shah, Chopra played a young television journalist who schemes to take advantage of an innocent young man with remarkable physical abilities, but eventually falls in love with him. The film was the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India and grossed over  worldwide attaining a blockbuster status.81 At the film premiere, members of the Bharatiya Yuva Morcha of Indore staged a protest against the release of the film, linked to the problems Chopra's family were facing with former secretary Prakash Jaju and the allegations that she was linked to Karachi-based underworld don Chhota Shakeel.82 Her next film was Dharmesh Darshan's romantic comedy Aap Ki Khatir, co-starring Akshaye Khanna, Ameesha Patel and Dino Morea. The press reported that production in London was marred by Chopra and Patel frequently feuding, something which Chopra denied.83 Neither the film nor Chopra's performance were well received.84 Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com stated that Chopra's portrayal of Anu was &quot;erratically sketched&quot; and that her character was never consistent: &quot;first flaky, then cool, and later, sensitive&quot;.85
Chopra's final release of 2006 was Farhan Akhtar's action-thriller Don (a remake of the 1978 film of the same name), with Shahrukh Khan. Chopra portrayed Roma (played by Zeenat Aman in the original film), who joins the underworld to avenge Don for killing her brother. The actress received martial-arts training for her role in the movie, and performed her own stunts.86 The film was declared a box-office success in India and overseas, with revenues of .87 Raja Sen of Rediff.com believed that Chopra convincingly portrayed Roma, &quot;looking every bit the competent woman of action&quot;.88
In 2007, Chopra had two leading roles. Her first film was Nikhil Advani's Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love, a romantic comedy in six chapters with an ensemble cast. She was featured opposite Salman Khan in the first chapter as Kamini, an item girl and aspiring actress who tries to land the lead role in a Karan Johar film with a publicity gimmick.89 Film critic Sukanya Verma praised her flair for comedy, especially her impressions of Meena Kumari, Nargis and Madhubala.90 Both Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love and her next film, Big Brother, proved unsuccessful at the domestic box-office.91
In 2008, Chopra starred opposite Harman Baweja in his father's Love Story 2050. Chopra played a double role, so she coloured her hair twice; once red to portray the girl from the future and then black for the girl of the past.92 Her performance was poorly received; Rajeev Masand was unimpressed with Chopra's chemistry with her co-star, remarking that her character &quot;fails to inspire either affection or sympathy&quot;.93 She next appeared in the comedy God Tussi Great Ho, portraying a TV anchor opposite Salman Khan, Sohail Khan and Amitabh Bachchan. The film was generally perceived to be plagiarised from the Hollywood comedy Bruce Almighty,9495 although writer and director Rumi Jaffrey claimed it to be &quot;a village folk tale about a Brahmin&quot;.96 Chopra next starred as a kindergarten teacher in Chamku opposite Bobby Deol and Irrfan Khan, and played the role of Sonia in Goldie Behl's fantasy superhero film Drona opposite Abhishek Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan. Drona, widely criticised for its extensive use of special effects, marked Chopra's sixth film in succession which had failed at both the box-office and critically, although Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com stated that Chopra displayed convincing action heroine skills.9798 Critics generally perceived at this time that her career was over.99
Critical acclaim (2008&lt;U+2013&gt;11)
The string of poorly received films ended when Chopra starred in Madhur Bhandarkar's Fashion, a drama about the Indian fashion industry which followed the lives and careers of several fashion models. Chopra portrayed the ambitious supermodel Meghna Mathur, a role which she initially thought was out of her depth, but after six months' consideration she accepted the role, inspired by Bhandarkar's confidence in her.100 During production, the media spread rumours that she was starving herself to reduce her weight to that of a supermodel. Chopra stated that she had to gain  for the role and steadily shed the weight during the production as the character progressed in the film,101 and claimed that her physique was achieved by two months of training on the beach and a disciplined diet:102

I always like to work on my character. That's why I work on one film at a time. For Fashion I opted for a toned body. I went on a health-conscious diet, though I didn't cut down on my food or anything ... It isn't about getting thin at all. It's just about toning my body. I don't think you need to be reed-thin to be beautiful. I think Indian women look terrible when they try to get anorexic. We (Indian women) are naturally healthy. And by that I don't mean voluptuous ... But, yes, we've been given a certain kind of figure. We're well proportioned and aesthetically endowed in all the right places. And by getting exceptionally thin, we're going against nature.

Both the film and her performance were appreciated by critics, and earned Chopra several awards, including the National Film Award,103 the Filmfare Award, the IIFA Award, the Screen Award, and the Apsara Award for Best Actress.104105 Rajeev Masand wrote, &quot;Priyanka Chopra turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best.&quot;106 Namrata Joshi from Outlook magazine on the other hand said, &quot;The film is packed with innumerable characters, but most remain sketchy, except for the heroine, Priyanka Chopra. And she too doesn't really come out shining. The small-town girl has a rather easy way up the modelling ladder.&quot;107 Fashion proved to be a turning point in Chopra's career.108 The film had net earnings of 109 and was noted for being a commercial success despite being a women-centric film and the absence of a male lead.110 She said in retrospect, &quot;I think actually Fashion kick started ... the process of female dominated films. Today you have so many other films which have done well with female leads.&quot;111
 Chopra's final film of the year was Tarun Mansukhani's romantic comedy Dostana, with Abhishek Bachchan and John Abraham. Set in Miami, the film tells the story of a friendship between her character and two men who pretend to be gay to share an apartment with her. Chopra played a stylish young fashion-magazine editor Neha, who is trying to deal with professional pressures in her life. Produced by Dharma Productions, the film was a financial success with worldwide revenues of over .112 Chopra's performance and look in the film were praised.113114
The following year Chopra played a feisty Marathi woman named Sweety in Vishal Bhardwaj's caper thriller Kaminey (co-starring Shahid Kapoor), about twin brothers and the journey in their life in a span of 24 hours linked with the underworld. Although she appeared in only eight scenes,115 her role earned her several awards and nominations, including a second Filmfare Award for Best Actress nomination116 and an Apsara Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role (her second consecutive win in that category after Fashion).117 The film received critical acclaim and became successful at the box-office with the worldwide gross earnings of .118 Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India thought that Chopra's role completely reinvented her,119 and Rajeev Masand wrote: &quot;Springing a delightful surprise in a smaller part is [Chopra], who sprinkles her lines with a smattering of fluent Marathi and emerges one of the film's most lovable characters.&quot;120121 Chopra subsequently appeared in Ashutosh Gowariker's romantic comedy What's Your Raashee?, based on the novel Kimball Ravenswood by Madhu Rye. The film depicts the story of a US-based Gujrati NRI in search of his soulmate among 12 girls (all played by Chopra) associated with the 12 zodiac signs. She was considered for inclusion in the Guinness World Records book for being the first film actress to portray 12 distinct characters in one film.122 Chopra's heavy workloadfilming for several productions, travelling for endorsements and performing at live shows (including the Miss India pageant)took its toll; she fainted during filming, and was admitted to hospital.123
In 2010 Chopra starred with Uday Chopra in Jugal Hansraj's unremarkable romantic comedy Pyaar Impossible! as Alisha, a beautiful college girl (and later a working mother) who falls in love with a nerdy boy. Later that year, she co-starred with Ranbir Kapoor in Siddharth Anand's romantic comedy Anjaana Anjaani. The film, set in New York and Las Vegas, follows the story of two strangers, both trying to commit suicide, who eventually fall in love with each other. The film was a moderate commercial success,124 and her performance received mixed reviews from critics. Sarita Tanwar of Mid Day wrote, &quot;Priyanka Chopra is at her casual and spontaneous best. She embraces the character completely and makes it totally believable&quot;,125 while Anupama Chopra dismissed her acting as &quot;artificial&quot;.126
 Chopra turned down the role of Phaedra in Tarsem Singh's Hollywood fantasy film Immortals because it conflicted with the shooting schedule for her first film of 2011, Vishal Bhardwaj's black comedy 7 Khoon Maaf.127 Based on the short story &quot;Susanna's Seven Husbands&quot; by Ruskin Bond, '' 7 Khoon Maaf'' centres on Susanna Anna-Marie Johannes, an Anglo-Indian woman (played by Chopra) who murders her seven husbands in an unending quest for love. Chopra's performance earned her the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress and a third Filmfare Award for Best Actress nomination at the 57th Filmfare Awards.128 Nikhat Kazmi remarked, &quot;7 Khoon Maaf would undoubtedly end up as a milestone in Priyanka Chopra's career graph. The actor displays exquisite command over a complex character that is definitely a first in Indian cinema.&quot;129 Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis wrote: &quot;Chopra gets a crack at a role of a lifetime and she sparkles like never before.&quot;130
Chopra's final release of the year saw her reprising her role as Roma in the second part of the Don film series, Don 2. Although the film received mixed reviews,131 Chopra's performance earned positive feedback from critics. According to The Express Tribune, &quot;Chopra ... seems to be the perfect choice for an action heroine. As you watch her effortlessly beat up some thugs in the movie, you come to the realisation that she may be the first proper female action hero in Bollywood.&quot;132 Don 2 was a major success in India and overseas, earning over  worldwide.133134 Don 2 was showcased at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival135 and (with Don) at the 2012 International Film Festival of Marrakech, in Morocco.136
Recent work (2012&lt;U+2013&gt;present)
In a 2012 interview with The Times of India, Chopra professed to have always &quot;wanted to be the sum of more than just my movies&quot; and said that she aspires to acquire a persona like Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. She remarked that &quot;I imbibe from people I work with and I want to be like them&quot;,137 and cited Mumtaz, Marilyn Monroe, and Audrey Hepburn as fashion inspirations.138 Chopra's first film of 2012 was Karan Malhotra's action drama Agneepath, in which she starred with Hrithik Roshan, Sanjay Dutt and Rishi Kapoor. Produced by Karan Johar, the film is a remake of his father's 1990 production of the same name. In one of several accidents to happen during production, Chopra's lehenga (a traditional skirt) caught fire while filming a sequence for an elaborate Ganpati festival song.139 Upon release, the film broke Bollywood's highest opening-day earnings record with a worldwide gross of .140141 Her performance as Kaali Gawde, Roshan's loquacious love interest, was appreciated by critics. Mayank Shekhar noted how much Chopra stood out in a male-dominated film.142 Chopra next co-starred with Shahid Kapoor in Kunal Kohli's romance, Teri Meri Kahaani. The film relates the stories of three unconnected couples (each played by Kapoor and Chopra), born in different eras. The film opened to mixed reactions from critics, but Chopra's performance was generally well received.143
 Anurag Basu's Barfi!, with Ranbir Kapoor and Ileana D'Cruz, was her final appearance of 2012. Set in the 1970s, the film tells the story of three people, two of whom are physically disabled. Chopra played Jhilmil Chatterjee, an autistic woman who falls in love with a deaf, mute man (Kapoor). Rituparno Ghosh, an acclaimed director, considered it a &quot;very, very brave&quot; role to accept given how demanding it is for an actor to convincingly portray a woman with autism.144 To prepare for the role, Chopra visited several mental institutions and spent time with autistic people.145 The film received rave reviews from film critics146147 and was a major commercial success, earning  worldwide.148 Chopra received unanimous praise for her portrayal, which several reviewers regarded as her best performance to date.149 The Indo-Asian News Service review said, &quot;Priyanka Chopra as the autistic Jhilmil steals the show from Ranbir, if that's possible. Her inherent glamorous personality simply disappears into her character. We don't see the actress on screen at all! We see only Jhilmil who reminds us in a very pleasant way of Sridevi in Sadma. This is one of the most flawless interpretations of a physical-psychological disability seen on celluloid.&quot;150 Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph noted Ranbir and Priyanka turn in two of the finest performances seen on the Indian screen.151 Chopra received another nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.152 The film was screened at the Busan153 and Marrakech International Film Festivals,154 and was chosen as India's entry for the 85th Academy Awards.155
Chopra's first release of 2013 was K. C. Bokadia's much-delayed Deewana Main Deewana, which had been filmed nearly a decade earlier. It received lacklustre reviews, primarily due to its aged look and feel.156 She agreed to a special appearance in Shootout at Wadala in a song called &quot;Babli Badmaash Hai&quot;, which was her first item number.157 Music composer Anu Malik and director Sanjay Gupta thought Chopra would be able to &quot;recreate the magic of Zeenat Aman or Parveen Babi&quot;; Chopra, however, was reluctant to do so, agreeing only after six months of persuasion.158159 In choosing her first item song, Chopra was strict over the lyrics and footage, in that she frowned against the use of vulgar words or skin on show, and rejected the songs of various composers before deciding upon an appropriate number.160
The actress has several projects under development in 2013. She has acted in Apoorva Lakhia's Zanjeer, a remake of the 1973 Hindi film of the same name.161 It was filmed in Hyderabad, simultaneously in Hindi and Telugu;162 the Telugu release is to be titled Thoofan.

 Chopra's main vocal influence was her father, who she said was &quot;an incredible singer&quot;, and helped develop her interest in singing.168169 She used her vocal talent early in her pageantry career.170 Her first recording, the song &quot;Ullathai Killadhe&quot; in the Tamil film Thamizhan (2002), was made at the urging of her director and co-star, Vijay (who had noticed her singing on the set).171 She declined to sing playback for &quot;Tinka Tinka&quot; in her film Karam (2005), preferring to concentrate on her acting career, but later sang the song live on the television programme Sa Re Ga Ma Pa.172 Chopra recorded an unreleased song for Bluffmaster!

Column writing
Chopra began writing an opinion column, &quot;The Priyanka Chopra Column&quot;, for the Hindustan Times in 2009. She said after her first year of writing: &quot;I'm a private person and never thought that I could express my feelings. But strangely enough, whenever I sat down to write this column, my inner most thoughts came to the fore.&quot;211 In March 2009, she met several readers who had submitted feedback on her weekly column.212 , Chopra was still writing sporadically for newspapers. In August 2012 she wrote a column published in The Times of India titled &quot;No woman in Mumbai feels safe any longer&quot;, discussing the murder of 25-year-old Pallavi Purkayastha,213 whom she met while working on Don.214 In the article, Chopra expressed her views about the safety of women in cities.215
