Nicholas Jonas is the eponymous debut studio album by American recording artist Nicholas Jonas, who subsequently adopted the stage name Nick Jonas. It was released on September 5, 2005 by INO Records, Daylight Records and Columbia Records. It incorporates primarily Christian music and pop music elements with lyrical themes of adolescence and childhood and Jonas' faith in God. Reviews of the album were mixed.1
Background
The album featured earlier cuts of later Jonas Brothers songs such as &quot;Time for Me to Fly&quot; and &quot;When You Look Me in the Eyes&quot;, and it also featured a cover of the Steve Winwood hit &quot;Higher Love&quot;. The song &quot;Crazy Kinda Crush&quot; was featured on the show Darcy's Wild Life. After the Jonas Brothers were signed as an act to Daylight and Columbia Records in 2005, Nick put his solo career on hold. They released their first album, It's About Time, on August 8, 2006. The song &quot;Time for Me to Fly&quot; was also used in the credits of the movie Aquamarine starring Emma Roberts, JoJo, and Sara Paxton.
Singles

Two singles, &quot;Dear God&quot; and &quot;Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)&quot;, were released in Fall 2004. Both songs were popular on Christian radio stations, but never gained the attention of mainstream radio.
With an unknown release date, &quot;Time For Me To Fly&quot; was released as a promotional single in 2004.2
