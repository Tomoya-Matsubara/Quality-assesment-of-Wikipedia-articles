Interstate 805 (I-805) is a major north&lt;U+2013&gt;south Interstate Highway in Southern California. It is a bypass of I-5, running along the eastern areas of the Greater San Diego area from San Ysidro near the Mexico&lt;U+2013&gt;U.S. border to near Del Mar. The southern terminus of I-805 at I-5 in San Ysidro is less than a mile north of the Mexican border. I-805 then traverses through the cities of Chula Vista and National City before reentering San Diego. The freeway then passes though the San Diego neighborhoods of North Park, Mission Valley, Clairemont, and University City before terminating at I-5 in the Sorrento Valley neighborhood near the Del Mar city limit.
Planning for I-805 began in 1956, and the route was officially designated in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Starting in 1967, the freeway was built in phases, with the northern part of the freeway finished before the southern part. I-805 was completed and open to traffic in 1975. Named the Jacob Dekema Freeway after the longtime head of the regional division of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), I-805 has been frequently cited for its complex engineering and architecture, including near I-8 on the Mission Valley Viaduct. Since then, several construction projects have taken place, including the construction of a &quot;dual freeway&quot; at the northern interchange with I-5. High-occupancy toll lanes are under construction on both the northern and southern portions of the route.
Route description
 The route begins at I-5 near the Mexican border in a far south part of San Ysidro, a neighborhood of San Diego. As it begins its journey northward, it quickly interchanges with State Route 905 (SR 905) before exiting the city and entering Chula Vista. In this city, it has interchanges with various arterial roads.1 In 2004, the San Diego Union-Tribune examined the apparent divide between rich and poor in the city of Chula Vista that seemed to be delineated by I-805; those on the eastern side of the freeway were more affluent and had better schools compared to those on the western side.2 Just outside the city, I-805 meets County Route S17 (CR S17), also known as Bonita Road, before interchanging with SR 54. The freeway then enters National City, where it intersects Sweetwater Road and Plaza Boulevard, before leaving the city and reentering the city of San Diego.3
It then continues northward through the city of San Diego, where it intersects SR 94, also known as the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway. As it continues through downtown San Diego, it meets SR 15, the continuation of I-15. It then intersects El Cajon Boulevard before passing under the Hazard Memorial Bridge that carries Adams Avenue and going over Mission Valley.4 The bridge was named after Roscoe Hazard for his involvement in the construction of several roads and highways in Southern California. I-805 then travels on the Mission Valley Viaduct, a towering reinforced concrete viaduct built in 1972, spanning over Mission Valley and the San Diego River.5 The viaduct is the top stack of the Jack Schrade Interchange over Interstate 8, which runs along the south side of Mission Valley and crosses underneath the viaduct perpendicularly, and is San Diego County's only symmetrical stack interchange. The San Diego Trolley traffic also runs under the viaduct on the valley floor.6
 I-805 then meets SR 163, also known as the Cabrillo Freeway. It continues through suburban San Diego, where it meets SR 52 in Clairemont Mesa. North of SR 52, it closely parallels Interstate 5 near La Jolla, heading northwest. Passing under the Eastgate Mall arch bridge and entering Sorrento Valley, it finally meets its north end at I-5.7 I-5 at the I-805 merge was known as the widest freeway in the Interstate Highway System in 2007, with 21 lanes.8 Eastbound SR 56 and Carmel Mountain Road are accessible via a parallel carriageway for local traffic heading northbound from I-805; traffic from SR 56 westbound can merge onto I-805 from the local bypass.9
The route is officially known as the Jacob Dekema Freeway after Jacob Dekema, a pioneering force from Caltrans who helped shape the San Diego freeway system.10 It is also part of the California Freeway and Expressway System11 and the National Highway System,12 a network of roads that are important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.13 In 2012, I-805 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 47,500 at the southern terminus, and 225,000 between Imperial Avenue and Market Street, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.14
History
Construction
According to Dekema, planning for I-805 began in 1956.15 The original routing for I-805 was approved as an Interstate Highway in July 1958.16 It was added to the state highway system and the Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 as Route 241.17 I-805 was expected to reduce traffic on what was then US 101, when it was completed in several years.18 Route 241 was renumbered to Route 805 in the 1964 state highway renumbering.19 Further planning was underway in 1965, with the goal to have the route done by 1972, the federal highway funding deadline.20 This was to be the first freeway in the area with no prior road along its route that it would replace; the goal was to allow people to provide a bypass around San Diego for those traveling to Mexico, and improve access for local residents. By June, homes along the route were being sold in the North Park area, which was to be the first stretch of the freeway constructed.21 The next year, Dekema confirmed that the first portion of what was known as the Inland Freeway to be built would be between Home and Adams avenues.22
In May 1967, bidding began after construction had been delayed by that of I-5 and I-8 which had been given higher priority. This first portion would run from Wabash Boulevard to around Madison Avenue (a distance of ), and the next portion would include the I-8 interchange.23 The R.E. Hazard and W.F. Maxwell Companies won the low bid of $11.7 million (about $ ) in mid-1967.24 The groundbreaking ceremony happened on September 25 at El Cajon Boulevard and Boundary Street.25 In August 1968, the portion of I-805 from just south of I-8 to north of Friars Road, including the interchange with I-8, was put up for bidding; at $27.5 million (about $ ), it was the most expensive job that the Division of Highways had ever put up for bid.26 The winning bid was $20.9 million (about $ ), and was awarded to R.E. Hazard Contracting Company and W.F. Maxwell Company.27
Construction had begun on the viaduct by May 1969;28 in the meantime, National City was making plans for developing the freeway corridor with motels and restaurants, as well as a shopping center.29 Bidding was to begin on  of I-805 from north of Friars Road to north of what was then US 395 in mid-1969.30 Construction from J Street south to near San Ysidro was underway by September, when there were concerns that an order from President Richard Nixon might affect funding for the portion north of Friars Road. However, Governor Ronald Reagan lifted the associated freeze in construction at the state level a few weeks later.3132 A month later, the contract for the portion between Friars Road and US 395 had been awarded for $15 million (about $ ); the portions between there and north of Miramar Road were in the planning phases, while construction continued south of I-8 to Wabash Boulevard.33 The  portion from SR 52 to Miramar Road had been contracted out to O.G. Sansome Company for $5.6 million (about $ ) by the end of 1969.34 Meanwhile, $4 million (about $ ) of state funding was spent in 1969 to find housing for those who were to be displaced by the freeway in San Ysidro.35
By March 1970, the original section between Home Avenue and near I-8 was almost complete, and the Mission Valley portion extending north of US 395 as well as from Otay Valley Road and J Street in Chula Vista were still under construction.36 The portion immediately north of US 395 was contracted to E.C. Young, Young and Sons, Inc., and A.A. Baxter Corporation for $7.9 million37 (about $ ). On July 6, the first section to begin construction was dedicated, and to be opened from El Cajon Boulevard to Wabash Boulevard soon thereafter; the rest of the section would not open until the Mission Valley interchange with I-8 was completed.38
A second border crossing in the San Ysidro area was proposed near the Playas de Tijuana area, that would be accessible from I-805, although another alternative was considered near Brown Field;39 a formal study was commissioned in August.40 However, it was discovered that this would add $10 million (about $ ) to the cost of the freeway, and possibly delay it by up to 10 years; furthermore, most traffic crossing the border was found to head to Tijuana and not Ensenada.41 Following this, the city of Chula Vista asked that the state proceed with the original plans to construct the freeway, even though it would pass through a San Ysidro neighborhood.42
In September 1970, bidding began for the final portion of the northern half of I-805 between Miramar Road and I-5;43 a month later, the segments between Home Avenue and SR 94, and SR 54 to 12th Street had funding allocated.44 By the end of the year, Hazard, Maxwell, and Matich had submitted the low bit of $7.2 million (about $ ) for the northernmost portion.45 The Chula Vista portion of the freeway from Main Street to L Street was completed in February 1971; by then, the estimate for completing the entire freeway had slipped to 1975.46 Estimates on the Mission Valley bridge had slipped to July 1972 by March.47 A 102-home mobile home park was approved by the City Council a few weeks later to house those who were displaced by the freeway construction.48
The portion of the freeway from Otay Valley Road to Telegraph Canyon Road opened during the year.49 On October 22, several unconstructed portions of I-805 were partially funded, including from Chula Vista south past SR 75, north of the completed Chula Vista portion to SR 54, from SR 54 to Plaza Boulevard in National City, from there to SR 94 (including the interchange with SR 252), and from there to Home Avenue.50 Before the end of the year, the portion from SR 94 to Home Avenue began the bidding phase;51 Guy F. Atkinson Company won the contract for $9.96 million (about $ ) in early 1972.52 Following a request from the El Cajon City Council,53 March 19 was set aside as a Community Cycle Day for bicyclists to travel the newly completed freeway from El Cajon Boulevard to SR 52, just before the freeway was to be dedicated;54 this part of the freeway was open to traffic that month.55
By the beginning of 1974, I-805 was complete north of Home Avenue, and from Otay Valley Road to Telegraph Canyon Road in Chula Vista;56 five segments remaining were under construction, and the last segment was funded.57 The Imperial Avenue section of I-805 remained in the budget, despite revisions in response to the 1973 oil crisis.58 In late January, I-805 between SR 15 and SR 94 was opened to traffic, though not all of the ramps at the SR 94 interchange were operational.59 The City of Chula Vista considered pursuing scenic highway status for I-805 through Sweetwater Regional Park;60 however, it is not eligible for the State Scenic Highway System according to the California State Legislature.61 The connectors to SR 94 east were completed in March;62 the entire portion between SR 94 and Home Avenue cost $10.5 million63 (about $ ). Construction between SR 94 and Imperial Avenue was well under way by December, at a cost of $8.5 million64 (about $ ).
As the scheduled completion of the freeway neared, Mayor Tom Hamilton of Chula Vista expressed concerns regarding the predicted development of the I-805 corridor, and the decisions that the City Council would need to make regarding such plans.65 The portion south of Otay Valley Road cost $15 million (about $ ), and the portion between Telegraph Canyon Road and Sweetwater Road cost $12 million (about $ ). The portion from there to Imperial Avenue was projected to cost $10.2 million66 (about $ ). The dedication of the freeway took place on July 23, 1975, even though the freeway was not completely finished, due to the desire to hold the ceremony during the summer.67 I-805 from Plaza Boulevard to Telegraph Canyon Road opened to traffic on July 28, leaving the freeway complete except for the portion between Plaza Boulevard and SR 94. While portions of the freeway were nearly complete, there were reports of motorists driving around on the closed freeway, which the California Highway Patrol did not support.68 On September 3, Dekema announced that the entirety of the freeway would open the next day as he made a final inspection of the unopened portion; the total cost of the construction was $145 million (about $ ). However, Dekema announced that there was no more state funding available to construct further roads for the short-term.69
Recognition, artwork, and architecture
 The Mission Valley Viaduct was recognized by the ASCE as the &quot;Outstanding Civil Engineering Project for 1973 in the San Diego Area&quot;; it was designed to match the close-by Mission San Diego de Alcala with its columns that look similar to cathedral windows,70 with arch-like shapes etched into the textured concrete. The viaduct was designed to span , and use squared-off support columns instead of traditional cylindrical supports. Octagonal columns were to be used on the ramps and the ends of the bridge.71 Over 600 tons of steel bars were to be used,72 and the bridge was constructed as high as  above I-8.73 The Adams Avenue Bridge over I-805 was also recognized for its  span and two tapered supports on the ends of the bridge; in 1968, a Princeton University engineering professor asked for a copy of the design from Caltrans for educational purposes.74 The construction supervisor, in fact, compared the construction of this bridge to building a boat, and it was constructed from the middle outward rather than the conventional method of building from the ends inward. The span was designed to be  long,75 and  high.76
Awards for the Eastgate Mall (or Old Miramar Bridge) came from the Federal Highway Administration, San Diego Highway Development Association, and Prestressed Concrete Institute Awards Program; at the time, it was one of the first arch bridges in the state, and did not use traditional concrete pillars.77 The San Diego Union (predecessor to the Union-Tribune) published a few freelance articles in 1984 about I-805, complimenting the four-level interchange with I-8 and the arch bridge at Eastgate Mall, while mentioning that subsequent inflation after their completion would have made such structures more difficult to build if they had been constructed later. Other artwork and architecture that was mentioned included the Wateridge development in Sorrento Valley, and the &quot;Stargazer&quot; by Alexander Liberman that was lit with florescent colors at night.7879
However, not all forms of artwork along the highway were uncontroversial. In 1977, there were several complaints regarding new billboards that were installed at the northern terminus of the highway, since they blocked the view of the coast.80 In 1981, an illegal mural that was determined to be incomplete was discovered at the I-8 interchange; while Caltrans discouraged the painting of such murals, they were impressed with the portion that had already been completed.81 Art Cole, the artist, stepped forward to the department, and was allowed to finish the mural of a desert highland sunrise; following this, Caltrans made efforts to have other murals commissioned.82
The San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce attempted to have I-805 named as the San Ysidro Freeway in 1976.83 However, I-805 was named after Jacob Dekema in August 1981, and ceremonies to mark the occasion occurred in February 1982.84 The plaque honoring Dekema was installed in November at the Governor Drive interchange.85 Because of his efforts in designing I-805, Ed Settle of Caltrans was given the Outstanding Civil Engineering Award from the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE); he designed several other regional freeways, including SR 163 through Balboa Park and I-5 through San Diego.86
Expansion
The construction of a &quot;dual freeway&quot; at the northern end was discussed as early as 1989, referring to the two carriageways needed for each direction of the freeway. It would require drivers to use the new local lanes to access eastbound SR 56 from I-5 or I-805. The project would allow for trucks to use the new lanes to assist in merging with traffic. However, it faced opposition from local residents, concerned about the loss of the view from their homes, as well as environmentalists concerned about nearby wetlands.87 Further objections espoused the view that the congestion would continue to increase, regardless of what was done, and that the new road would be at capacity in a few years.88 SANDAG funded the construction with $110 million (about $ ) in mid-2000.89
Construction of the &quot;dual freeway&quot; began in early 2002, at a cost of $182 million90 (about $ ) The northbound lanes were scheduled to open in February 2006.91 The southbound lanes were completed in early 2007.92 That year, a three-year project began to allow robot controlled vehicles, including buses and trucks, to use a special lane. The intention is to allow the vehicles to travel at shorter following distances and thereby allow more vehicles to use the lanes. The vehicles will still have drivers since they need to enter and exit the special lanes. The system was designed by Swoop Technology, based in San Diego County.93
Two years later, construction began on two auxiliary lanes on I-805 southbound from SR 54 to Bonita Road, to improve traffic flow at the SR 54 interchange.94 In 2010, Caltrans proposed adding high-occupancy toll express lanes between SR 15 and East Palomar Street in Chula Vista.95 The CTC awarded $100 million for the work in June 2011, which would be split into two phases at the interchange with SR 54.96 Work is also underway to add two HOV lanes between SR 52 and Mira Mesa Boulevard; this project also received $59.5 million from the CTC in September 2011.97 Meanwhile, SANDAG made arrangements to purchase the SR 125 toll road and reduce the tolls, which was hoped to encourage commuters to take that road instead of I-805 and reduce congestion; this would then enable Caltrans to construct two managed lanes instead of the original four.98
In February 2013, construction began on the northern express lanes; the project is expected to cost $86 million.99 By May, construction on the Palomar Street direct access ramps had begun, and the Carroll Canyon Road ramps were almost finished.100 The southern express lanes project is projected to cost $1.4 billion.101
