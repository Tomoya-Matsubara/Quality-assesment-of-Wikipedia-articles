History
Kingdom of Yugoslavia 1936&ndash;1941

Serbia, then a part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia became a member of FIBA in 1936.  The national team did not show any success in its first couple of years and later suspended play due to World War II.

SFR Yugoslavia 1946&ndash;1991
main Yugoslavian national basketball team
Yugoslavia made its European championship debut in Eurobasket 1947, the fifth edition of the tournament.  The team placed 13th out of 14 teams in the competition, losing to the Soviet Union national basketball team Soviet Union and Hungary national basketball team Hungary in the preliminary round, beating the Netherlands national basketball team Netherlands but losing to Italy national basketball team Italy in the semifinal round placing third in the three-way tie between the teams, and defeating Albania national basketball team Albania in the 13th/14th classification match.

Yugoslavia's appearance at the Eurobasket 1957 tournament in Sofia resulted in a 21 record for the preliminary round and advancement to the final round robin.  There, they proved capable of two wins, defeating Poland national basketball team Poland and France national basketball team France to finish at 25 for 6th place in the tournament.

Yugoslavia had many successes at the FIBA World Championships. The national team captured 3 titles in 1970 FIBA World Championship 1970, 1978 FIBA World Championship 1978 and 1990 FIBA World Championship 1990, Later capturing 2 more titles as FR Yugoslavia in 1998 FIBA World Championship 1998 and 2002 FIBA World Championship 2002.

The Yugoslav national team of the late 1980s and early 1990s featured what was perhaps the greatest generation in the history of Yugoslav basketball. A common quip about basketball is: The Canadians invented it, the Yugoslavs perfected it. With such future NBA players as Draen Petrovi, Vlade Divac, Toni Kuko, Dino Raa, Predrag Danilovi and arko Paspalj, has pioneered the wave of international National Basketball Association NBA players well before the early 21st century, when the concept began to gain true global momentum.

Many of the former Yugoslav stars mentioned above were a part of the under-21 national team that won the FIBA World Junior Championships in 1987, defeating the United States both in pool play and in the final.

FR Yugoslavia/Serbia and Montenegro 1992&ndash;2006
Despite being a noticeably smaller country, the national basketball team continued to be a very competitive force in the international scene. They won a number of back to back Eurobasket championships, and World Cups. They dominated the world scene in 1990s, in generations led by players such as Vlade Divac, Aleksandar orevi and Dejan Bodiroga, but went through a crisis in early 2000s.

On Eurobasket they have won 3 gold medals, in Eurobasket 1995 1995, Eurobasket 1997 1997, Eurobasket 2001 2001 and one bronze medal in Eurobasket 1999 1999. Serbia and Montenegro was host of Eurobasket 2005, but only took 9th place. They also took the silver medal at the Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics 1996 Summer Olympics.

Yugoslav Olympic Committee selected the national basketball team for the best male team five times, from 1995 in sports 1995 to 1998 in sports 1998 and in 2002 in sports 2002.http://www.oks.org.rs/?page_id=462&lang=sr-latn

Serbia 2006&ndash;present
A new generation, again led by coach Duan Ivkovi returned some of the old glory by taking the silver medal in Eurobasket 2009, and fourth place in the 2010 FIBA World Championship, with the youngest team.http://www.b92.net/sport/kosarka/vesti.php?yyyy=2010&mm=08&dd=25&nav_id=454142
