Christopher Darrell Matthews (born September 22, 1962, Perth, Western Australia) is a former Australian cricketer, who played for the Australian cricket team, the Western Warriors, Lancashire County Cricket Club, and the Tasmanian Tigers. Chris Matthews was an excellent left arm fast bowler, who generated lively pace, and performed well in the test arena, but was overshadowed by the emergence of young Queensland firebrand, Craig McDermott, and never had the opportunity to show his true talent. Matthews signed for Lancashire County Cricket Club in 1988, but only managed three matches for them. He returned to Western Australia, but failed to hold down a regular spot, and so moved to the Tasmanian Tiger's in 1990, where he became highly successful, taking 119 wickets for them before retiring at the end of the 1994-95 season.
