Dunk Island lies 4 km off the Australian east coast, opposite the town of Mission Beach1. The island forms part of the Family Islands National Park and is in the larger Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area2.
Geology and wildlife
Dunk Island is by far the largest island in the Family Islands National Park, all of which consist of granite rock3. All of the islands were part of the mainland before the last sea level rise began 8,000 years ago. Dunk Island covers 970ha, of which 730ha is national park and the rest is freehold. Its topography varies, with sandy beaches and rocky shores, slightly undulating slopes, foothills and steeper semi-rugged terrain. Mt Kootaloo is the island's highest point, at 271m above sea level.
There are over 100 species of birds on Dunk Island, including rare and vulnerable seabirds4. During the summer months, the island becomes a breeding site for terns and noddies. The lack of predators, along with a plentiful supply of food from the surrounding reef waters, make it an ideal nesting site. Dunk Island is also home to reptiles such as pythons, tree snakes, monitor lizards, geckos and skinks. The island's fringing reefs and surrounding waters are home to an array of marine life such as sea turtles, dugongs, corals, fish, shellfish and crabs.
History
Early history
The traditional Aboriginal owners of Dunk Island are the the Bandjin and Djiru people5, who have lived in this area for tens of thousands of years6. After the sea level rise, they paddled to the islands in bark canoes to gather food and materials. The Aboriginal name for Dunk Island is Coonanglebah, or &lt;U+201C&gt;The Island of Peace and Plenty&lt;U+201D&gt;.7 It received its European name from Captain Cook, who sailed past it on June 8 17708, remarked that it was a &quot;tolerable high island&quot; and named it after George Montague-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax9.
Europeans settled the nearby mainland during the 1800s, seeking gold, timber and grazing land10. In 1848, John MacGillivray studied the fauna and flora of the island while HMS Rattlesnake was anchored off the island for ten days11. He subsequently wrote of its natural features in the Narrative of the Voyage of HMS Rattlesnake, published in England in 185212.

Dunk Island's most famous resident, Edmund James Banfield, moved to the island with his wife in 1897 and stayed until his death in 192313. He recorded his life on the island in a series of books, the most famous of which was The Confessions of a Beachcomber14.
World War II and the development of the resort
The island was bought in 1934 by Captain Brassey and Banfield's bungalow provided the basis for the beginnings of a resort15. The Royal Australian Air Force occupied Dunk Island during World War II, building its airstrip in 194116. They installed a radar station on the island's highest point a year later, which was then dismantled when the war ended in 1945. The Brassey family returned to the island after the war, but sold it to Eric McElree of Avis Rent-A-Car in 1956, who upgraded the resort's facilities. In 1976, Trans Australian Airlines purchased Dunk Island. Ownership then passed to Qantas in 1992, following its merger with Australian Airlines. On December 24 1997, the island was purchased by P&amp;O Australian Resorts, who were then acquired by current owners Voyages in July 2004.17
Cyclone Larry
On March 20 2006, Cyclone Larry hit Dunk Island as the Category 5 storm crossed the coast of Queensland. Around 160 staff members and 280 guests had been evacuated to Cairns, but 20 Voyages staff stayed behind on the island18. The resort suffered structural and water damage19, but reopened on July 1 200620 after an estimated $20 million of refurbishment and rebuilding21.
Land use
National park
 Dunk Island has thirteen kilometres of walking tracks spread over five main routes, ranging from a short walk to Edmund James Banfield's grave to a 4 hour island circuit hike22. Commercial operators offer guided tours around the island, as does the Dunk Island resort.
Resort
Dunk Island Resort is run by Voyages, a relatively exclusive 160 room resort popular with couples23. Its facilities include two restaurants, two bars, a caf&lt;U+00E9&gt;, a spa and a 9-hole golf course. The resort offers a number of free and paid activities for its guests, including day trips to other parts of the Great Barrier Reef.
Camping ground
There is also a camping ground available for visitors as part of the national park, although a permit is required for its use24.
Artists' colony
Dunk Island is also home to a small community of artists who live, work and showcase their work on a property on the southern side of the island25. The Colony was established in 1974 by former Olympic wrestler Bruce Arthur, and has continued to operate after his death in 1989, now run by Susie Kirk.
Airstrip
Dunk Island also has a small airstrip, Dunk Island Airport, located near the resort, with frequent flights to Cairns26.
In popular culture
Dunk Island was chosen as the location for the 1969 film Age of Consent, which was based on a story by the artist and writer Norman Lindsay27. Directed by Michael Powell, it starred James Mason as Bradley Morahan, a jaded Australian artist returning from New York and Helen Mirren as Cora Ryan, a local teenager. Age of Consent attracted controversy over nudity and a sex scene, which led to some censorship and cuts. Much of the film was shot on the beach at Brammo Bay where ferries bringing visitors now dock.
