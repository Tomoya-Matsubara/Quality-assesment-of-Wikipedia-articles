Radama II (23 September 1829 – 12 May 1863 [assumed dead]) was king of the Merina Kingdom which controlled nearly all the island of Madagascar. He ruled from 1861 until he was believed assassinated in 1863.
Upbringing and early years
Radama II was born Prince Rakoto (Rakotosehenondradama). He was officially recognized as the son of King Radama I and his widow Queen Ranavalona I, although the king had died more than nine months before the prince's birth. He was likely fathered by a lover of his mother, Andriamihaja, a progressive young officer of the Merina army who the queen may have been tricked into putting to death by conservative ministers at court.1
After his mother succeeded Radama on the throne, she instituted an increasingly regressive regime that attempted to restore traditional values and contain or eliminate westernization. The prince, however, who had been highly influenced by the French advisor to the queen, Joseph-Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Lambert, was favorably impressed by European culture, knowledge and its superior state of economic, political and technological development. He was troubled by some of the socially repressive policies pursued by Ranavalona I. The French played on this sympathy in 1857 by pressuring Prince Rakoto into signing a request for French aid that would have enabled France to establish control over Madagascar had the true nature of the letter and its signing not been uncovered by Radama and his British contacts.
Prior to Queen Ranavalona's death, the conservative and progressive factions within the Merina court waged a tactical power struggle to secure a successor favorable to their own political agenda.2 The conservative faction favored Ramboasalama, the son of the Queen's sister, while the Queen's Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony and head of the army Rainilaiarivony, brothers and progressives, supported Radama II. The latter successfully obtained key strategic allies within the court that enabled Radama to seize the throne without violence following his mother's death. Ramboasalama was obliged to swear a public oath of allegiance to Radama, and was later sent into exile in the highland village of Ambohimirimo where he died in April 1962.3
Progressive reign
Prince Rakoto ascended to the throne after the natural death of his mother in 1861, taking the name Radama II. Once upon the throne, he immediately attempted a rapid and dramatic reversal of many of his mother's traditionalist policies. He reopened the country to foreign powers and concluded treaties of friendship with Britain and France. The Lambert Charter opened up business possibilities for French investors. Freedom of religion was declared, persecution of Christians ceased and missionaries returned to the country and reopened their missionary schools. The trial by tangena was abolished and inhabitants of Antananarivo were permitted to raise swine within the city walls, previously forbidden by a fady (taboo) forbidding them from being kept near the royal talismans (sampy); the sampy were dispersed to the sacred villages where they had originated under 16th-century Merina king Ralambo and other early monarchs.4 Significantly, Radama freed numerous political prisoners captured during provincial wars of subjugation and offered repatriation of property confiscated during the aggressions under Ranavalona I; this generous pardon was reciprocated by many of the beneficiary ethnic groups around the island, and good will between the coasts and central administration at Antananarivo improved significantly.5 These changes, and the king himself, were unequivocably praised by Madagascar's European partners:

The reaction within Imerina was less one-sided. The abrupt and dramatic policy changes pursued by the progressive king alienated and disfranchised established conservative factions among the andriana (nobles) and Hova (freemen) at court. The special privileges accorded to Joseph-Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Lambert and his partners under the Lambert Charter - including the implementation of public works projects (felling trees, making roads, building canals etc.), control over minting coinage, exclusive mining rights and more as part of the purview of Lambert's proposed Compagnie de Madagascar (French Madagascar Company) - were especially controversial. The citizens' concern stemmed from clauses in the agreement that would have permit Lambert's company to become permanent owners of Malagasy lands. Until this point, land in Madagascar, which was viewed by the populace as the sacred ground of the ancestors, could only ever be temporarily possessed by foreigners until their death, at which point the land would revert to the crown. The threat of permanently losing any part of sacred Malagasy soil to foreigners was deeply troubling.67
Attempted assassination
The legalization of dueling was ultimately the issue that brought to a head the tension between King Radama II's entourage (mostly friends and some established political figures, known collectively as the menamaso or &quot;red-eyes&quot;) and representatives of the opposition led by Radama's prime minister Rainivoninahitriniony. On May 7, 1863, Radama II announced his intention to allow disputes to be settled by a duel, much to the disapproval of many of his advisers at court. The prime minister prevented the law from being publicly declared at the Zoma (Friday) market the following day. Friday afternoon, the prime minister's younger brother, Rainilaiarivony, who was head of the army, called several thousand troops into the city to besiege a number of the menamaso and members of the royal family at the Rova palace compound, and by Saturday morning the decision had been made and carried out to execute eleven of the menamaso and other key political figures who had counseled Radama to legalize dueling. On Sunday, May 10, Rainivoninahitriniony demanded that Radama hand over the menamaso he was sheltering in the palace, which he refused to do until the Prime Minister agreed to spare their lives; they were handed over but by Monday morning had all been speared to death. 
The drama ended on Tuesday morning, May 12, 1863, when a group of officers and soldiers forced their way into the palace and seized the king. His wife, queen Rabodo, pleaded for his life to be spared and attempted to stop them but was forcibly removed. The soldiers threw a lamba over Radama's head and strangled him with a silk sash until he was believed to be dead, thereby avoiding the shedding of royal blood as was the custom for royal executions in Imerina.8
The nobles informed Rabodo that she would have their support as queen on the condition that she would accept to abide by certain articles that would form a new contract between rulers and ruled in Madagascar:

Rabodo agreed to these conditions. The next morning, it was publicly announced in the marketplace that Radama had taken his own life due to grief over the deaths of his compatriots the menamaso and that Rabodo would succeed him as Queen Rasoherina. To cement the new power-sharing agreement between the ruler, the nobles and the heads of the people, a political marriage was contracted between the queen and Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony, who had been instrumental in her first husband's death.9 Radama's name was struck from the list of kings and it was declared illegal to mourn his death.10
Rumors of survival
Following Radama II's apparent death, rumors spread that he had only been rendered unconscious by the attempt on his life and had revived after his murderers hastily placed his body in a tomb at Ilafy. It was believed that he was residing on the west coast of the island and had gained supporters. The rumors persisted to the point of causing some political turmoil in the Merina capital.11
These claims may have had some substance judging by the actions of others. Prominent Christian missionaries outside the capital made extensive efforts to visit and support Radama but seemingly never succeeded. Traditionalist factions within the government were concerned enough by the rumors to have put to death sixteen of his supporters, as well as fining hundreds of others.12 In the mid-1960s, a study by Raymond Delval provided very strong evidence that Radama did indeed survive and, having failed to regain the throne, lived to old age as an ordinary citizen in the north of the island.13
With the apparent murder of Radama II, the power of the Merina monarchs was broken. Subsequent monarchs were controlled by influential Hova (Merina freemen), particularly Rainilaiarivony, who became Prime Minister and successively married all three remaining queens of the monarchy: Rasoherina, Ranavalona II and Ranavalona III.
