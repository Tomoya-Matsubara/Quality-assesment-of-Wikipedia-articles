The A588 is a road in England, which runs from Poulton-le-Fylde to Lancaster in Lancashire. It is the primary route serving the Over Wyre areas of the Fylde.
The road runs a total distance of , in a roughly north-easterly direction, and is largely rural in character. It begins in the centre of Poulton-le-Fylde  and runs  north-east, as Breck Road, to meet the A585 eastbound at the River Wyre roundabout. After , it turns north (left) away from the A585, crossing the River Wyre at Shard Bridge, the last crossing of the river before its estuary. From here the road winds through the Over-Wyre villages of Hambleton, Stalmine and Pilling and across the marshy land that abuts the Cockerham Sands portion of Morecambe Bay. At Cockerham, almost  from Shard Bridge, the road turns to the left, and, as Lancaster Road, runs a further  north, eventually terminating as it joins the A6 by the Royal Lancaster Infirmary
