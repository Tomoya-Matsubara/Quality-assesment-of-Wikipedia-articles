Maybe Tomorrow was the only album released by The Iveys (who later called themselves Badfinger). It was issued in 1969 on the Apple label in Japan, West Germany and Italy. The scheduled release of the album in the U.S. and UK at that time was halted. Many reasons for halting the album have been suggested by the band and Apple employees, but the most common suggestion is that Apple's newly-hired president, Allen Klein, had stopped all non-Beatle releases until he could examine the company's finances.
Due to Badfinger's subsequent fame and the album's limited release, Maybe Tomorrow was an expensive collectible for many years, often earning between $200 and $400 US dollars for a single used copy. Although a 1990s re-release of the album on CD format curbed demand for the original album, the CD itself became collectible due to a limited run.
The songs on Maybe Tomorrow vary widely from pop, rock, and psychedelic. With few exceptions, they do not resemble the sound Badfinger would later become known for. The title track was released as an Apple single in 1968 and enjoyed limited success in regional markets.

On the sleeve Derek Taylor writes that the &quot;four very nice kids [...] were not, nor are they now adventurous innovators, but they are ready, they are ready to be. The Iveys can sing and they play tight, rich stuff, write it too; they can write anything. They are lovely lads. [...] For them all Apple feels love and admiration.&quot;
