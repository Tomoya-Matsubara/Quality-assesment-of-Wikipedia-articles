Slovenia chose its entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 on 29 January in their selection, EMA 2006, when 14 songs competed for the votes of the public and a panel of experts. The three voting groups would determine the winner. EMA veteran Sa&lt;U+0161&gt;a Lendero and her ethnic dance song &quot;Mandoline&quot;, won both the televoting and SMS votes while in the end, the jury decided the outcome and An&lt;U+017E&gt;ej De&lt;U+017E&gt;an with the song Plan B won the competition, causing much controversy. More dispute was caused when accusations were made that the song was a copy of a song called Santa Maria sung by Austrian singer Simone, therefore breaking the contest rules. The European Broadcasting Union, however, did not see it as a copy, and therefore the song was not disqualified. The song is written by Ur&lt;U+0161&gt;a Vla&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+010D&gt; and composed by Matja&lt;U+017E&gt; Vla&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+010D&gt;.
The song, performed in English in Athens as &quot;Mr Nobody&quot;, did not come in the top 10 in the semi-final, finishing 16th with 49 points, therefore not qualifying for the final.
18 year old An&lt;U+017E&gt;ej De&lt;U+017E&gt;an born on the 17 June 1987 in Celje, will be one of the youngest performers in Athens. He was a newcomer to this year EMA, but has past experience by providing the backing vocals to Slovenian superstar Nu&lt;U+0161&gt;a Derenda's song in 2005. He originally came to fame on 'Bitka talentov,' the same talent show which discovered Slovenia's 2005 Eurovision singer Omar Naber. An&lt;U+017E&gt;ej has already recorded a duet with EMA runner-up Sa&lt;U+0161&gt;a Lendero. An&lt;U+017E&gt;ej is a very style conscious young man, and goes through more image and hairstyle changes in a couple of years, than most people manage in a lifetime.
