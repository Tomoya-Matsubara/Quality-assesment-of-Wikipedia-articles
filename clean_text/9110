&quot;Jihad&quot; is a song by the American thrash metal band Slayer which appears on their 2006 album Christ Illusion. The track was primarily written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman, and portrays the imagined viewpoint of a 9/11 terrorist. Slayer vocalist Tom Araya lent help during the lyrical process.
&quot;Jihad&quot; was met with mixed critical reviews upon its release, with critics focusing on the song's controversial subject matter. The song drew comparisons to the Slayer track &quot;Angel of Death&quot; which appears on the 1986 album Reign in Blood. Also penned by Hanneman, &quot;Angel of Death&quot; caused outrage at the time of its release. Joseph Dias of the Mumbai Christian group Catholic Secular Forum expressed concern over &quot;Jihad&quot;, which contributed to Christ Illusion's recall by EMI India, with no plans of a reissue in that country. ABC-TV's Broadcast Standards and Practices department censored &quot;Jihad&quot; for Slayer's first US network television appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live. Only the opening minute was broadcast over the show's credits, and 40% of the song lyrics were deleted.
Origins
 &quot;Jihad&quot; was mainly written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman, though it features lyrical contributions by vocalist Tom Araya.1 The song is written from the perspective of a 9/11 terrorist, and imagines the thoughts that &quot;the enemy&quot; might have.23 The song's climax features spoken text taken from a motivational letter left behind by Mohamed Atta,4 who was named by the FBI as the head suicide terrorist of American Airlines Flight 11, the first plane to crash into the World Trade Center during the September 11, 2001 attacks.
Guitarist Kerry King has been outspoken in his defense of &quot;Jihad&quot;, and has claimed that the song has the &quot;coolest angle&quot; on Christ Illusion.5 &quot;These new songs aren't political at all,&quot; King states, &quot;'Jihad', 'Eyes of the Insane' &lt;U+2014&gt; it's what's spewing out at us from the TV.&quot;6 He further clarified that the band was not attempting to promote the terrorist's perspective of the war, nor their ideological beliefs, though he expected others to assume that Slayer was doing so.7 They did not wish to dwell on the topic &quot;because every band on the planet already has&quot; and &quot;came from a certain perspective&quot;, so felt they had to present an alternative viewpoint.8 &quot;We're Slayer, we have to be different&quot; was King's assertion.9
American singer songwriter Steve Earle attempted a similar concept in penning &quot;John Walker's Blues&quot; (from the 2002 album Jerusalem), written as though from the perspective of the Washington-born John Walker Lindh, a Taliban member captured during the 2001 US-led invasion of Afghanistan.1011 Earle received criticism for the track. King anticipated a comparable reaction to &quot;Jihad&quot;:1213 &quot;People make an assumption before they (read) the lyrics. It's definitely not only human nature, it's very American-natured.&quot;14
Music and structure
&quot;Jihad&quot; spans 3:31 minutes.15 A little skittering vamp leads into the track, where Lombardo shimmers his hi-hat.16 Smoothly mixing up tempos, Slayer then begins to enter with a fast,17 wonky,18 catchy and angular little19 guitar riff reminiscent of the breakdown in 1986's &quot;Angel of Death.&quot;20 This guitar riff decelerates and bursts forward again in two-bar stretches over Lombardo's pounding, fifth-gear drumming.21
IGN reviewer Andy Patrizio was dismissive of the song's music and structure alongside other tracks from Christ Illusion: &quot;'Jihad,' 'Flesh Storm,' 'Skeleton Christ,' 'Supremist,' after a while they are a blur of the same riffs, tuning, tempos and arrangements.&quot;22
Reception and criticism
&quot;Jihad&quot;, alongside fellow Christ Illusion album tracks &quot;Eyes of the Insane&quot; and &quot;Cult&quot;, was made available for streaming via Spanish website Rafabasa.com on June 26, 2006.23 Slayer's ninth studio album Christ Illusion was released on August 8 2006, hosting the track's inclusion. The song met mixed reviews.
Blabbermouth's Don Kaye judged that &quot;a handful of songs&quot; on Christ Illusion &quot;are either too generic or the arrangements too clumsy to work well (I'm looking at you, 'Jihad' and 'Skeleton Christ')&quot;24 Ben Ratliff of New York Times remarked that the song &quot;is predictably tough stuff, but let's put it on a scale. It is tougher, and less reasoned, than Martin Amis's recent short story 'The Last Days of Muhammad Atta.' It is no tougher than a taped message from Al Qaeda.&quot;25 Peter Atkinson of KNAC.com was equally unimpressed, describing the group's choice of song climax as:26

However, not all reviews were so negative. Thom Jurek of All Music Guide commented &quot;the band begins to enter and twist and turn looking for a place to create a new rhythmic thrash that's the most insane deconstruction of four/four time on tape.&quot;27 Marc Savlov of Austin Chronicle asked people to &quot;listen to the eerie, stop-start cadence of lunacy in &quot;Jihad,&quot; with Araya essaying the role of a suicide bomber almost too convincingly.&quot;28
King would have appointed &quot;Jihad&quot; as the group's nomination in the &quot;Best Metal Performance&quot; award category at the 49th Grammy Awards, deeming the chosen track &quot;Eyes of the Insane&quot; &quot;the poorest representations&quot; of the group on ninth studio album Christ Illusion.29 Despite King's statement, &quot;Eyes of the Insane&quot; won Slayer their first Grammy award.30
Controversy



&quot;Jihad&quot;'s lyrical matter provoked controversy from several quarters; Peter Atkinson of KNAC.com remarked that the song &quot;no doubt will be Christ Illusion&lt;U+2019&gt;s most controversial track &lt;U+2014&gt; especially if some flag-waving Fox News dipshit like Bill O'Reilly or Sean Hannity gets clued in.&quot;31 In May 2006, World Entertainment News Network announced that revelations of the song's lyrical content had angered the families of September 11 victims.32
Joseph Dias of the Mumbai Christian group Catholic Secular Forum (CSF) issued a memorandum to Mumbai's police commissioner, in which he expressed concern that &quot;Jihad&quot; would offend &quot;the sensibilities of the Muslims...and secular Indians who have respect for all faiths.&quot;33 EMI India met with the CSF, apologising for Christ Illusion's release and recalling the album with no plans of a reissue.34 On October 11 2006 it was announced all stocks had been destroyed.35 The track, alongside the album's controversial Larry Carroll painted cover art and provocative lyrics, were the reasons behind EMI India's decision.36 Though Araya had expected &quot;Jihad&quot;'s treatment of the events of 9/11 to create an American backlash,37 it failed to materialise, in part, he believes, due to peoples' view that the song is merely &quot;Slayer being Slayer&quot;.38 Meanwhile, Hanneman expected that the Muslim community would either &quot;embrace&quot; the song or hate Slayer for penning the song, or the victims of 9/11 would hate Slayer for the track.39
&quot;Jihad&quot; was one of six songs performed by Slayer during their first US network television appearance on ABC-TV's Jimmy Kimmel Live (January 19, 2007), though only the opening minute of the track was broadcast.40 ABC-TV's Broadcast Standards and Practices department censored &quot;Jihad&quot;, and approached Slayer the day prior to broadcast with roughly 40% of the song lyrics deleted.41 King has since affirmed that the group were ten minutes from withdrawing but eventually said &quot; 'Let's just go do it.&quot;42
&quot;Angel of Death&quot; comparisons
The song has drawn comparisons to &quot;Angel of Death&quot;,4344 a Hanneman-penned Slayer track from 1986's Reign in Blood, which was lyrically inspired by Nazi physician Josef Mengele.45 &quot;Angel of Death&quot; focused on human experiments conducted by Mengele at the Auschwitz concentration camp in World War II.46 KNAC.com's Peter Atkinson commented upon the similarities, to which King responded:47  Making the connection, King remembers thinking &quot;Great, now we're gonna be answering for this one!&quot; after listening to a playback of the song.48 &quot;But as with 'Angel [of Death],' we're not endorsing anything. It's just not an 'anti' song, either.&quot;49 Hanneman emphasised, &quot;Like 'Angel of Death,' it's just a documentary.&quot;50
