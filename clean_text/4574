Jim Allenby (born 12 September 1982 in Perth, Western Australia) is an Australian cricketer. He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler.
Allenby began playing senior cricket for Durham CB, though he only played one game for the team and it was a further three years before he made another first-class or List A appearance. Allenby played one limited overs match during the 2005 season, and his first County Championship appearance, for his new team, Leicestershire, a year later, though his debut saw him make little impact with either bat or ball.
Allenby has become a regular player in the Leicestershire middle-order, with one century at first-class level so far under his belt, achieved against Essex in his very first County Championship game.
In the English off-season at the start of calendar year 2007 he played one game for Western Australia, having previously played for their Under-19 team between 2000 and 2002.
On 15 June 2008, Allenby became the first player in Twenty20 Cup history to achieve four wickets with four consecutive balls, when he removed Lancashire Lightning players Kyle Hogg, Steven Croft, Dominic Cork and Sajid Mahmood. Unfortunately for Allenby, he was out for a duck in the Leicestershire innings, as his side lost the match by 37 runs.
