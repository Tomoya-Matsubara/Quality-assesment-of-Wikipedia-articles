Bradley Joseph (born 1965, Willmar, Minnesota) is an American composer, pianist/keyboardist, arranger, and recording artist. Active since 1983, he played in various rock bands throughout the Midwest until New Age artist Yanni hired him sight unseen based on a tape of his own compositions. He was a featured concert keyboardist with Yanni through six major tours and appears in the 1993 multi-platinum album and video, Yanni Live at the Acropolis.1 He also spent four years as keyboardist and co-musical director for Sheena Easton.
Joseph's solo career began in 1994 when he independently released Hear the Masses, featuring many of his Yanni bandmates. This debut album was followed by Rapture, an instrumental album recorded with a 50-piece orchestra and released on the Narada label. He has produced his next seven albums under his own record label, Robbins Island Music. Two of his albums, Christmas Around the World and One Deep Breath, held positions on NAV&lt;U+2019&gt;s Top 100 radio chart. His musical style ranges from original solo piano pieces to &quot;full blown&quot; orchestral compositions and arrangements.2 While busy with his own career, Joseph reunited with Yanni in 2003 for the 60-city Ethnicity tour, during which time he wrote The Journey Continues after sound checks. He was named one of the &quot;Ten Outstanding Young Minnesotans&quot; of 2004.3
Biography
Joseph was born in 1965 and raised in Willmar, Minnesota.4 With his father as an influence, he started playing classical piano at age eight.5 While playing in the jazz band in junior high, he took a concert field trip which left no doubt that music was the &quot;only possible path in his future&quot;.6 Joseph remembers, &quot;I saw Buddy Rich perform, I sat in the first row and when Buddy's sax player stood up to take his first solo something just clicked &lt;U+2014&gt; the world closed in around me. I felt the power of music and knew that it was something special, a gift to be shared&quot;.7 Joseph played the trombone through high school and college, studying music at Moorhead State University.8 Brainerd Dispatch's Terry Mikelson cites that Joseph came of age as a musician in the Twin Cities' rock scene, heading up many of his own bands,9 including a rock band he co-founded in 1987 that toured Midwest nightclubs.10 He played sax and guitar in some of his earlier bands but left them to concentrate on just the piano/keyboards.11
Early career
Yanni
In 1988, Joseph caught the attention of contemporary instrumental artist Yanni via a mutual friend, guitarist Dugan McNeill. When Yanni heard Joseph's compositions and arrangements, he was hired to join his core band, replacing John Tesh.12 In a 2002 interview with Indie Journal Joseph recalls, &quot;I recorded a demo tape of some of some original material. It happened to be what Yanni was looking for at the time. He hired me over the phone without ever meeting.&quot;13 
After moving to Los Angeles at age 23, he composed, arranged, and performed alongside Yanni for more than six years, performing in-concert with a number of notable symphony orchestras, touring throughout the U.S. and abroad as Yanni was approaching worldwide fame.14 Some of these early tours included the Reflections of Passion, Revolution in Sound, Dare to Dream,15 Yanni Live, The Symphony Concerts 1993 and 1994 concert tours, as well as a performance in Germany that was broadcast throughout Europe and seen by 30 to 40 million viewers.16 Joseph is featured on the multi-platinum album and video, Yanni Live at the Acropolis. He returned as a featured instrumentalist on Yanni's 2003 Ethnicity world tour''.17 During this same time, Joseph worked extensively in recording studios on music ranging from rock and pop to rhythm and blues and orchestration with numerous artists from RCA, Epic, Warner Brothers, and Polygram Records,18 in addition to performing in an elaborate national keyboard show tour with various musicians.19
Sheena Easton
In between tours with Yanni, Joseph performed with Sheena Easton for four years as her co-musical director and lead keyboardist.20 &quot;It was a great transition from Yanni because it made me musically aware again&quot;, he said in reference to Easton's R&amp;B style. &quot;I went back to where I started but it felt like a new invention.&quot;21 When asked by Fred Wheeler how he got hooked up with Sheena Easton, Joseph replied that he was recommended by a former road manager. He was included in a try-out with four others, rehearsed with the band, they then cut it down to two, and rehearsed with Sheena for the final cut.22 Extensive tour venues with Easton included Japan, Indonesia, Puerto Rico, and the United States, as well as routine appearances in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. He appeared with her on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno when she performed her new single at the time, &quot;My Cheri&quot;.23
Solo career

&quot;I am a composer first and foremost, and have always believed that being able to write memorable melodies is what sets musicians apart.&quot;24


The 1994 release of Joseph's debut album, Hear the Masses, an upbeat instrumental album featuring several of Joseph's Yanni bandmates.

In 1994, between world tours, Joseph released his debut album, Hear the Masses, a self-produced, self-published release under the More Core Records label consisting of 10 original compositions. He invited many of his bandmates, whom he had met through Yanni, to contribute. They include Charlie Adams (drums, percussion); Ric Fierabracci (fretless bass); Jeanette Clinger (vocals), and Grammy-winning violinist Charlie Bisharat. Other guest artists include Larry Preston (guitar), and Terry Brau &lt;U+2014&gt; featured on numerous Bradley Joseph recordings &lt;U+2014&gt; playing trumpet, saxophone, and fluegelhorn.
Joseph's style on his debut album attracted the attention of Narada Productions, a Virgin Records subsidiary. This resulted in Rapture which was recorded with a 50-piece orchestra.25 Wind and Wire Magazine contributor, Michael Debbage, recalls, &quot;It was the year 1997 and New Age music had already peaked commercially as the interest and exposure seemed to lag. The genres main labels - Narada, Windham Music and Higher Octave - were beginning to explore worldly themes versus the warm, earthly, acoustic themes that prior artists had established. It appeared that the abundance of new artists was becoming a dying breed. An exception to the rule was Bradley Joseph, who released his first mainstream album Rapture to glorious reviews, and to this day it remains his tour de force.&quot;26 One of Joseph's compositions, &quot;The Glen&quot;, was written for the album Stories, a Narada Artist Collection, and is now also featured on 20 Years of Narada Piano. His work is included in other Narada compilation projects as well.
Joseph started Robbins Island Music in 1998, composing, producing, and distributing his own recordings. Hence, Solo Journey was released and is comprised of eleven solo piano compositions. It is characterized by Debbage as being a &quot;scaled down introspective, ... and while simplistic was still breath-taking.&quot;27 Later releases include Christmas Around the World reaching NAV's top 100 radio playlist;28 and One Deep Breath also holding a position on NAV's top 100 radio chart for over six months.29 Bill Binkleman writes, &quot;One Deep Breath is an album with two distinct 'feels' to it: the more serene new age/ambient soundscapes that bookend the inner tracks and the more radio-friendly and mainstream music in-between. While I doubt fans of Liquid Mind or other mainly electronic new age music artists would wholly embrace the overt romanticism of piano-led tracks like 'Dancers Waltz' or 'Dreamer's Lullaby', there is definite appeal on the album for fans of adult contemporary piano pieces as well as for lovers of the more minimal approach to new age music.&quot;30 &quot;The vocal expressions by Clystie Whang and Joseph have devotional qualities. They weave through the atmospheres and soundscapes smoothly&quot;, according to Jim Brenholts of All Music Guide.31

The 2003 release of The Journey Continues features Joseph on solo piano and is meant to be a sequel to his 3rd album, Solo Journey. It was written during sound checks on Yanni's Ethnicity world tour.

He wrote his sixth album after sound checks during Yanni's Ethnicity tour. The Journey Continues, a sequel to Solo Journey, again features Joseph on solo piano. Debbage writes, &quot;The magical world of movies has a knack for exploring sequels. There is the beauty and beast effect when taking this pathway. The creative beauty allows the viewers to see the continued growth of its characters. The beastly aspect of this exploration is the Hollywood exploitation of an almost guaranteed return on its investment with no regard for its creative progression that usually sees diminishing returns. Bradley Joseph has decided to walk this tightrope by following up with Solo Journey that was released back in 2000. I am glad to report that The Journey Continues is entrenched in beauty, holding up well to its predecessor.&quot;32 Debbage also voted this album as one of his top 15 recordings of 2003.33 Joseph was named one of the &quot;Ten Outstanding Young Minnesotans&quot; (TOYM) of 2004.34 The award honors individuals across the state under 40 who make a positive impact on their community. Past recipients include Mark Dayton, Marlene Johnson, Walter Mondale, and Dave Winfield. In the same year, Orange Music released two compilation CDs; The Road Ahead and In the Heart of Everyone, in addition to re-releasing his Christmas Around the World album. These were distributed throughout Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia.35 In a review by Yeoh Wee Teck of In the Heart of Everyone, he remarked &quot;Instead of attempting to fuse elements of different cultures like everyone else, he chose to rely on what he knows best - simple arrangements with assured piano playing.&quot;36
Subsequent releases include For the Love of It and Piano Love Songs, in which Joseph uses piano, orchestra, and soft rhythms to cover melodies such as &quot;I'll Never Fall in Love Again&quot; (Burt Bacharach), and &quot;Fields of Gold&quot; (Sting). Additionally, a DVD was released using Joseph's music throughout, Isle Royale Impressions Volume II, containing video footage by Carl TerHaar of scenery and wildlife from the Isle Royale National Park in Michigan.37
Musical style and composition
In an interview with Indie Journal, Joseph has said that when writing music he prefers to concentrate on the melody first, stating, &quot;Basically, I write from a two person standpoint. First, I let the song take hold and I put down the idea as a raw emotional statement. Then I let it breathe and come back, approaching from more of an objective point of view. This allows me to rediscover the true meaning I intended in the beginning, shedding new light on how I can best represent that to the listener.&quot;38 The range of ways in which he utilizes synthesizers is equally as characteristic, inspired early in life by keyboard-oriented pop/rock bands like Styx and Journey.39       
Joseph's musical style and direction have varied over time. His recordings can offer orchestral compositions such as in the albums Hear the Masses or Rapture which features intimate piano pieces, quartets, and full orchestrations, &quot;combining smooth jazz with contemporary instrumental themes&quot;.40 In contrast, the albums Solo Journey and The Journey Continues &quot;...features Joseph and his piano with no additional clutter&quot;, and are considered to be &quot;stripped back and basic&quot; by Michael Debbage of Wind and Wire Magazine. &quot;There is color in the songs via their understated melodies.&quot;41 As examples, Debbage describes Joseph as using a chord progression that translates into a strolling rhythm in the song &quot;The Road Ahead&quot;, and &quot;The confidant 'Within A Painting' has Joseph fluttering on the piano improvising much like his peer Michael Jones.&quot;42 Solo Piano Publications' contributor, Kathy Parsons, writes, &quot;My favorite track on Solo Journey is 'The Long, Last Mile', which starts out with a bittersweet melody, and then builds in intensity and complexity with cello, winds, and ethereal sounds intertwining around the piano. Then it breaks off, and the opening melody returns.&quot; She also remarks, &quot;'The First Snow' is a lovely vignette that gently describes the quiet but dazzling splendor of the first snow of the season. Joseph makes effective use of arpeggiated chords in the upper registers to depict the light dancing in sparkles.&quot;43 Debbage describes &quot;A Minnesota Snowfall&quot; from the album Christmas Around the World as having &quot;a more naked, bare-boned ballad approach&quot;.44
In discussing the album One Deep Breath, Binkleman observes, &quot;...Joseph departs dramatically from the previous more explosive and dynamic music on his first two recordings, Hear the Masses and Rapture. One Deep Breath has two separate 'personalities': piano and keyboard-based ambient/new age soundscapes (primarily the first and last tracks) and more adult contemporary classically flavored songs.&quot;45 He goes on to say, &quot;...some [tracks] are similar to the work of artists like David Lanz, Kevin Kern and others who bring a rich melodic sensibility to piano-led new age/adult contemporary music.&quot;46 Parsons describes the album as &quot;...a fascinating combination of structured melodic pieces and free-form, ambient compositions.&quot; &quot;The influence of years of touring with Yanni is apparent in the richness of Joseph&lt;U+2019&gt;s sound, but his musical voice is his own.&quot;47
West Central Tribune's Anne Polta reports that Joseph often references the past when he names his songs and his music is frequently reminiscent of his rural Minnesota roots.48 &quot;Wind Farmer&quot; was inspired by childhood visits to a relative's farm near Olivia, and his company, Robbins Island Music, is named after a city park in Willmar.49
