 Throughout the Soviet history millions of people became victims of Soviet political repression, which in various degrees was an instrument of the internal politics of the Soviet Russia and Soviet Union since the first days after the October Revolution. Culminating during the Great Purge, it still existed during the &quot;Khrushchev Thaw,&quot; followed by increased persecution of Soviet dissidents during Brezhnev stagnation, and didn't cease to exist even during Gorbachev's perestroika. Its heritage still influences the life of the modern Russia. 
Origins and early Soviet times

Early on the theoretical basis of the repressions was the Marxist view at the class struggle and the resulting notion of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Its legal basis was formalized into the Article 58  in the code of RSFSR and similar articles for other Soviet republics.
The term &quot;repression&quot;, &quot;terror&quot;, and other strong words were normal working terms with respect to the internal politics of the early Soviet state, reflecting the fact that the dictatorship of the proletariat was supposed apply ruthless force to suppress the resistance of the social classes which Marxism considered antagonistic to the class of proletariat. This phraseology was gradually abolished after destalinization, but the system of persecution for political views and activities remained until the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
At times, the the victims were called the enemies of the people. Punishments by the state included summary executions, torture, sending innocent people to Gulag, involuntary settlement, and stripping of citizen's rights. Sometimes, all members of a family, including children, were punished as &quot;traitor of Motherland family members&quot;. Repression was conducted by the Cheka, OGPU and NKVD in several consecutive waves known as Red Terror, Collectivisation, the Great Purges, the Doctor's Plot, and others. The secret police forces conducted massacres of prisoners on numerous occasions. Repression was practiced in the Soviet republics and in the territories liberated by Soviet Army during World War II, including Baltic States and Eastern Europe 1.
State repression led to resistnace, which were brutally suppressed by military force, such as the Tambov rebellion, Kronstadt rebellion, and Vorkuta Uprising. During the Tambov rebellion, Bolshevik military forces used chemical weapons against villages with civilian population and rebels.2 Prominent citizens of villages were often taken as hostages and executed if the resistance fighters did not surrender. 3
Red Terror

Red Terror in Soviet Russia was the campaign of mass arrests and executions conducted by the Bolshevik government. The Red Terror was officially announced on September 2, 1918 by Yakov Sverdlov and ended in about October 1918. However Sergei Melgunov applies this term to repressions for the whole period of the Russian Civil War, 1918-1922.45
Collectivization

Collectivization in the Soviet Union was a policy, pursued between 1928 and 1933, to consolidate individual land and labour into collective farms (, kolkhoz, plural kolkhozy). The Soviet leaders were confident that the replacement of individual peasant farms by kolkhozy would immediately increase food supplies for the urban population, the supply of raw materials for processing industry, and agricultural exports generally. Collectivization was thus regarded as the solution to the crisis in agricultural distribution (mainly in grain deliveries) that had developed since 1927 and was becoming more acute as the Soviet Union pressed ahead with its ambitious industrialization program.6 As peasantry, with exception of the poorest part, resisted the collectivization policy, the Soviet government resorted to the harsh measures to force the farmers to collectivize. In his conversation with Winston Churchill Stalin gave his estimate of the number of &quot;kulaks&quot; who were repressed for resisting collectivization as 10 million, including those forcibly deported.78
Great Terror

The Great Purge (, transliterated Bolshaya chistka) was a series of campaigns of political repression and persecution in the Soviet Union orchestrated by Joseph Stalin in 1937-1938.910 It involved the purge of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, repression of peasants, deportations of ethnic minorities, and the persecution of unaffiliated persons, characterized by widespread police surveillance, widespread suspicion of &quot;saboteurs&quot;, imprisonment, and killings.11 Estimates of the number of deaths associated with the Great Purge run from the official figure of 681,692 to nearly 2 million.
Democide, ethnic cleansing, and population transfers

In Soviet Union, political repressions targeted not only individual persons, but also whole ethnic, social, religious, and other categories of population.
Population transfer in the Soviet Union may be classified into the following broad categories: deportations of &quot;anti-Soviet&quot; categories of population, often classified as &quot;enemies of workers&quot;, deportations of nationalities, labor force transfer, and organized migrations in opposite directions to fill the ethnically cleansed territories. In most cases their destinations were underpopulated remote areas, see Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union.
Entire nations and ethnic groups have been collectively punished by the Soviet Government for alleged collaboration with the enemy during World War II. At least nine of distinct ethnic-linguistic groups, including ethnic Germans, ethnic Greeks, ethnic Poles, Crimean Tatars, Balkars, Chechens, and Kalmyks, were deported to remote unpopulated areas of Siberia (see sybirak) and Kazakhstan. Population transfer in the Soviet Union led to millions of deaths due to the inflicted hardships.12Koreans and Romanians were also deported. Mass operations of the NKVD were needed to deport hundreds of thousands of people.
The Soviet famine of 1932-1933 was severely aggravated by the actions of the government of the Soviet Union, such as confiscation of food no meet the planned delivery amounts with disregard of the circumstances, blocking the migration of starving population, and the suppression of the information about the famine, which prevented any organization of relief. This had lead to deaths of millions of people in the affected area.13. The overall number of the 1932-1933 famine victims Soviet-wide is estimated as 6-7 million14 or 6-8 million.15
Gulag

Gulag: A History, by Anne Applebaum,16 explains: &quot;It was the branch of the State Security that operated the penal system of forced labour camps and associated detention and transit camps and prisons. While these camps housed criminals of all types, the Gulag system has become primarily known as a place for political prisoners and as a mechanism for repressing political opposition to the Soviet state.&lt;U+201D&gt;
Repressions in Baltic countries

The Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 as the result of the German-Soviet Pact and its Secret Additional Protocol.17
The repressions followed with the mass deportations carried out by the Soviets. Order &lt;U+2116&gt; 001223, &quot;On the Procedure for carrying out the Deportation of Anti-Soviet Elements from Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia&quot;, contained detailed instructions for procedures and protocols to observe in the deportation of Baltic nationals. Public tribunals were also set up to punish &quot;traitors to the people&quot;: those who had fallen short of the &quot;political duty&quot; of voting their countries into the USSR. In the first year of Soviet occupation, from June 1940 to June 1941, the number confirmed executed, conscripted, or deported is estimated at a minimum of 124,467: 59,732 in Estonia, 34,250 in Latvia, and 30,485 in Lithuania.18 This included 8 former heads of state and 38 ministers from Estonia, 3 former heads of state and 15 ministers from Latvia, and the then president, 5 prime ministers and 24 other ministers from Lithuania.19
Post-Stalin era (1953-1991)
After Stalin's death, the suppression of dissent was dramatically reduced and took new forms. The internal critics of the system were convicted for anti-Soviet agitation, Anti-Soviet slander, or as &quot;social parasites&quot;. Others were labeled as mentally ill, having sluggishly progressing schizophrenia and incarcerated in &quot;psikhushkas&quot;, i.e. mental hospitals used by the Soviet authorities as prisons20. A number of notable dissidents, including Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Vladimir Bukovsky, and Andrei Sakharov, were sent to internal or external exile.
Loss of life
The exact number of victims may never be known and remains a matter of debate among historians. The published results vary depending on the time when the estimate was made, on the criteria and methods used for the estimates, and sources available for estimates. Some historians attempt to make separate estimates for different periods of the Soviet history. For example, the number of victims under Joseph Stalin's regime vary from 8 to 61 million 21 22 23 24 25 26
