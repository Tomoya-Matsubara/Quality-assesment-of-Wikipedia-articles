For the racehorse, see Fanfreluche (horse)
Fanfreluche was a French-language Canadian children's television show made in Quebec by Radio-Canada. The show made its debut in 1968 and ran for forty-six episodes until 1971. 1 It starred Fanfreluche, a living doll (played by Kim Yaroshevskaya) who retold fairy tales and legends to the viewers. When the story went a way that displeased her, she would physically enter it to &quot;fix&quot; the ending which sometimes put her in a perilous situation.
The character of Fanfreluche (played by the same actress) had its debut in another Radio-Canada children's show called La Bo&lt;U+00EE&gt;te &lt;U+00E0&gt; surprise. From the character in this show, prominent Montreal businessman and Thoroughbred horse breeder Jean-Louis L&lt;U+00E9&gt;vesque named one of his fillys Fanfreluche. Believed to have used the name to please a grandchild, Levesque's filly became a Canadian and United States champion racehorse in 1970.
