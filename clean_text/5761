Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Francisco de San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n G&lt;U+00F3&gt;mez y Matorras, also known as Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; de San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n (c. 1778 &lt;U+2013&gt; 17 August 1850), was an Argentine general and the prime leader of the southern part of South America's successful struggle for independence from Spain.
Born in Yapey&lt;U+00FA&gt;, Corrientes in Argentina, he left his mother country at the early age of seven and studied in an aristocratic school in Madrid, Spain, where he met and befriended Chilean Bernardo O'Higgins.
In 1808, after joining Spanish forces in the Peninsular War against the French, and after participating in several battles such as the Battle of Bail&lt;U+00E9&gt;n, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n started making contact with South American supporters of independence from Spain.
In 1812, he set sail for Buenos Aires from England, and offered his services to the United Provinces of South America (present-day Argentina). After the Battle of San Lorenzo of 1813, and some time on command of the Army of the North during 1814, he started to put into action his plan to defeat the Spanish forces that menaced the United Provinces from Upper Per&lt;U+00FA&gt;, making use of an alternative path to the Viceroyalty of Per&lt;U+00FA&gt;. This objective first involved the creation of a new army, the Army of the Andes, in the Province of Cuyo, Argentina. From there, he led the Crossing of the Andes to Chile, and prevailed over the Spanish forces at the Battle of Chacabuco and the Battle of Maip&lt;U+00FA&gt; (1818), thus liberating Chile from Royalist rule. Then he set sail to attack the Spanish stronghold of Lima, Per&lt;U+00FA&gt;, by sea.
On 12 July 1821, after seizing partial control of Lima, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n was appointed Protector of Per&lt;U+00FA&gt;, and Peruvian independence was officially declared on 28 July 1821. A year later, after a closed-door meeting with fellow libertador Sim&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var at Guayaquil, Ecuador, on 22 July 1822, Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var took over the task of fully liberating Peru. San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n unexpectedly left the country and resigned the command of his army, excluding himself from politics and the military, and moved to France in 1824. The details of the 22 July meeting would be a subject of debate by later historians.
Together with Sim&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n is regarded as one of the Liberators of Spanish South America. He is the national hero of Argentina. The Order of the Liberator General San Martin () in his honor is the highest decoration in Argentina.
Birth

Son of Spaniard Juan de San Martin y G&lt;U+00F3&gt;mez, born in Cervatos de la Cueza on 25 February 1778, and wife Gregoria Matorras, he was born the fifth and last child in Yapey&lt;U+00FA&gt;, a small village in Corrientes, Argentina. The exact year of his date is disputed, and there are no records kept of his baptism and later documents formulated during his life (such as passports, military career records, wedding, etc.) give him inconsistent ages. Most of such documents point his year of birth to either 1777 or 1778.1
His father was a Colonel in office as Lieutenant Governor of Yapey&lt;U+00FA&gt; beginning in 1774. In 1781, the family moved to Buenos Aires.
Spain
In 1785, his father was transferred again, this time to Spain, first in Madrid and then in M&lt;U+00E1&gt;laga. And so the family moved to Spain, and San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n enrolled in Malaga's school of temporalities where he studied from 1785.2
In 1789, aged 11, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n left the Real Seminario de Nobles and enrolled in the Regiment of Murcia, starting his military career as a cadet in the Unidad de Infanter&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Murcesa (Murcian Infantry Unit).
Military career in Europe


 After joining the Regiment of Murcia, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n participated in several campaigns in Africa, fighting in Oran against the Moors in 1791 among other places. Later, by the end of the First Coalition of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1797, his rank was raised to Sub-Lieutenant for his actions against the French in the Pyrenees. On August of the same year, after several engagements, his regiment surrendered to British naval forces in 1798. Soon afterward, he continued to fight in southern Spain, mainly in C&lt;U+00E1&gt;diz and Gibraltar with the rank of Second Captain of light infantry. He continued to fight Portugal on the side of Spain in the War of the Oranges in 1801, and was soon after promoted to captain in 1804.
When the Peninsular War started in 1808, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n was assigned ayudante (Spanish, aide) of the First Regiment Voluntarios de Campo Mayor. After his actions against the French, he became captain in the Regiment of Borbon. On 19 July 1808, Spanish and French forces engaged in the Battle of Bail&lt;U+00E9&gt;n, in which Spanish forces prevailed, allowing the Army of Andalucia to attack and seize Madrid. For his actions during this battle, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n was decorated with a gold medal, and his rank raised to lieutenant colonel.
While in Spain, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n became acquainted with several criollos (creoles), and became aware of the independence movements in America.
On 16 May 1811, he participated in the Battle of Albuera under the command of general William Carr Beresford. During the battle he met Scottish Lord MacDuff (James Duff, 4th Earl of Fife) who introduced him to the lodges that were plotting the South American independence efforts. San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n requested resignation from the Spanish army, which was granted.
Throughout his time serving in Spain he experienced hindrances and prejudices in his career and life in general because he was born in the Americas. Although he only lived there for a short time and had Spanish parents his career and social mobility were limited.
England
With the help of Lord MacDuff, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n obtained a passport to England where he met several criollos, American-born Spaniards like himself, who were part of the Logia Lautaro founded by the Venezuelan Francisco de Miranda. According to Argentine historian Felipe Pigna, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n was introduced to the Maitland Plan by members of the lodge founded by Miranda and Lord MacDuff.
In 1812, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n set sail for Buenos Aires aboard the British frigate George Canning.3

Argentina
Following his arrival in Buenos Aires on 9 March 1812, his rank of lieutenant colonel was recognized by the Triumvirate and he was thus entrusted with the creation of the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers (), which would become the best-trained military unit of the revolution.
During 1812, he focused on training troops by following the modern warfare techniques he had acquired during the Peninsular War. With Carlos Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a de Alvear and Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Matias Zapiola, he also established the Logia Lautaro (), an offspring in Buenos Aires of the independence lodges in London and C&lt;U+00E1&gt;diz. On August of the same year, he married Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a de los Remedios de Escalada, a young woman from one of the local wealthy families.
In October, when news of the victory of the Army of the North () commanded by Manuel Belgrano reached Buenos Aires, the Lautaro Lodge initiated political pressure, backed by San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's armed forces and popular demand, to impose its candidates into government, thus forcing the First Triumvirate to an end and initiating the Second Triumvirate with members Juan Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Paso, Nicol&lt;U+00E1&gt;s Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez Pe&lt;U+00F1&gt;a, and Antonio &lt;U+00C1&gt;lvarez Jonte (Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez Pe&lt;U+00F1&gt;a and &lt;U+00C1&gt;lvarez Jonte were members of the lodge). This new government strengthened the position held by the Army, and decided to lay siege to Montevideo, which was controlled by loyalists to the Spanish Crown. On 7 December 1812, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n was promoted to Colonel.
Beginning of his military career in South America

Although not technically a battle (in Spanish the battle is referred as Combate de San Lorenzo (&quot;San Lorenzo Combat&quot;)), references in English language refer to the event as the &quot;Battle of San Lorenzo&quot;.
On 28 January 1813, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n with his Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers was sent to protect the Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; River shore from the Spanish Fleet's ships under command of General Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Zavala. On the morning of 3 February, the Spanish forces disembarked and fought against San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n in the Battle of San Lorenzo.
During the fight, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's horse was shot dead. The horse fell, trapping one of San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's legs underneath it. This made him an easy target, but Sergeant Juan Bautista Cabral helped him extricate himself. While he was helping the Colonel, Cabral was attacked himself, and died from his wounds after the battle. After the battle, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n was promoted to General. This was San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's first military action in South America.
Army of the North

After the victories of Tucuman and Salta, the Army of the North, commanded by Manuel Belgrano, lost much ground after serious defeats at Vilcapugio (1 October) and Ayohuma (14 November 1813). The Triumvirate then decided to send San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n to the North with a small infantry army and his cavarly regiment.
After joining the defeated Army of the North in Yatasto, he took command of it on January 1814, and Belgrano became second in command. During his command, the Army camped in Tucum&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, where he started instructing the troops, created a new military school, and sent Colonel Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Miguel de G&lt;U+00FC&gt;emes to fight against loyalists coming from Peru to gain time. However, after minor struggles in Salta and Jujuy, news of the victory of Commander Guillermo Brown against the royalists' navy, and the resulting blockade of Montevideo, made the loyalist forces from Peru retreat to regroup.
During his command of the Army of the North, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n confirmed one of the reasons behind the Maitland Plan's scheme: royalist forces that came down from Upper Per&lt;U+00FA&gt; (roughly present day Bolivia) were easily defeated by the independentist forces in the valleys of Salta and Jujuy. But because of the geographical advantage, forces attacking Upper Peru were easily defeated by the royalists for the very same reasons.
Governor of Cuyo
In C&lt;U+00F3&gt;rdoba, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n continued preparing his plan of attacking Lima &lt;U+2014&gt; the Capital city of the Viceroyalty of Peru &lt;U+2014&gt; through Chile. He realized that it would be impossible to enter the large city without having conquered the land to the south. To this end, he requested to be appointed governor of the Province of Cuyo. Later, Juan Pueyrred&lt;U+00F3&gt;n was sent by the provisional government of the United Provinces of the R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o de la Plata, and gave San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n full support on his Liberatory Campaign ().
One month after he took office, royalist forces defeated rebel forces under Bernardo O'Higgins' command (O'Higgins fled to the Andes). San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n strengthened his espionage network with the so-called Guerra de zapa (&quot;War of Zapa&quot;), a pun on the expression Trabajo de zapa, which means hidden work done slyly towards some particular aim. He kept his troops in Mendoza to train and prepare them.
On this behalf, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n sent his Aide-de-camp and amateur cartographer &lt;U+00C1&gt;lvarez Condarco (carrying a copy of the Declaration of Independence of the &quot;United Provinces of South America&quot; (today Argentina) to Chile as an excuse) through Los Patos pass (the longest path), and returned through the Uspallata (the shortest one), to perform reconnaissance of several locations, mainly the Chacabuco area. Other measures included a disinformation campaign in Chile by sending fake information on the possible attack routes, and information gathering of the situation in Chile in order to prevent a possible attack from there.
Army of the Andes
  During his governorship of Cuyo, he organized the Army of Cuyo. On 8 November 1814 he created the 11th Infantry Battalion () which included the argentinian Corps of Chile (), which was under command of Lieutenant Colonel Juan Gregorio de las Heras. By October 1815, after contributions of several provinces, the army had 1,600 infantry soldiers, 1,000 men in cavalry, 200 men in artillery and 10 cannons. However many problems arose, such as low supplies of powder, iron, and uniforms. Because existing local industries were not enough to supply the Army, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n handled the problem by creating local industries in Cuyo to meet the requirements of it.
On the other hand, despite having the support of the Supreme Director Juan Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n de Pueyrred&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, opinions about his campaign were not as favorable on the national level. His efforts were often undermined by the skepticism of some local leaders about the viability of the campaign against the Viceroyalty of Peru through the Andes. However, on 1 August 1816, Pueyrred&lt;U+00F3&gt;n renamed the army to Army of the Andes (), appointed San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n as its General in Chief, and gave the Army a national priority level. By the end of this difficult process, San Martin&lt;U+2019&gt;s army had grown immensely.
Crossing of the Andes

In September 1816, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n relocated the Army of the Andes to El Plumerillo, in the northern part of Mendoza Province, where he finished the details to start his crossing of the Andes. The army was divided in two main columns and four minor ones, keeping the decided paths in secret.
On 18 January 1817, a main column parted with the artillery to Chile through Uspallata, under command of Brigadier Juan Gregorio de las Heras, reaching Las Cuevas on 1 February 1817. The second main column, led by San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n, left on 19 January through Los Patos pass, and reached San Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt;s de T&lt;U+00E1&gt;rtaro on 8 February, where he was later joined by Las Heras, concluding the first part of the crossing. By the time the main columns reunited, both had already had minor skirmishes: the first column had fought royalists in Potrerillos, while the forces led by San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n had fought the Battles of Achupallas and Las Coimas.
The crossing of the Andes was extremely difficult and took 21 days due to high altitudes and low temperature. It is considered a major feat in military history.
Campaign in Chile
After crossing the Andes and entering Chile, the Spanish royalist forces were taking positions in Mount Cuesta Vieja, preparing themselves for the confrontation against the Army of the Andes.
Battle of Chacabuco
  By 10 February 1817, the Army of the Andes was in the Aconcagua valley, and the Spanish royalist forces had not still taken full positions. San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n then took the initiative and hastened preparations for his attack. Despite a severe attack of Rheumatoid arthritis, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n commanded the battle, and seeing the Spanish forces under numerical inferiority and considering the surprise factor, developed a strategy for the Spanish forces to surrender, avoiding bloodshed. The charge was a stalemate until Soler's division joined the battle turning the odds in favor of the patriot side.
After the battle, the royalist forces had suffered five hundred casualties and six hundred royalist soldiers had been taken prisoner. On the Army of the Andes side, there were twelve killed and around one hundred wounded. The army also gained new artillery and other weapons, besides restoring the Chilean revolution. San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n sent a message reporting the victory: &quot;The Army of the Andes has attained glory and can report: In twenty-four days we have completed the campaign, passed through the highest mountain range on the globe, defeated the tyrants and given freedom to Chile&quot;.
Chacabuco aftermath
 On 14 February 1817, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n and O'Higgins triumphally entered Santiago, and on 18 February, in a meeting held in the town open hall, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n was appointed Governor of Chile. San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n immediately resigned, thus O'Higgins was elected Supreme Director of the State of Chile (). The United Army () was created with Chilean and Argentine soldiers. The Chilean soldiers were under O'Higgins command, while San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n was General in Chief of the whole United Army.
Then San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n, in order to raise funds for a fleet, left for Buenos Aires. After negotiating with Pueyrred&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, a delegation was sent to London to provide ships for a new fleet in the Pacific Ocean. Back in Chile in the last days of 1817, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n sent a delegation to Lima under the pretext of proposing to the Viceroy Joaqu&lt;U+00ED&gt;n de la Pezuela of Peru the regularization of the war and exchange of POWs. The real purpose was to gain as much information as possible about the enemy's plans. The delegation brought the news that a Spanish army under General Mariano Osorio was about to set sail in four frigates to southern Chile.
Despite the success in the Battle of Chacabuco, and while leaving Santiago and the northern Chile under patriot control, the royalist forces still had strong presence in southern Chile. The men under Osorio's command joined the royalist forces in the south by sea. The royalists also had allied themselves with Mapuche native Americans.
Battle of Cancha Rayada

On 19 March 1818, the royalist forces concentrated and fortified in Talca with around five thousand men under General Osorio, while the independent Osorio was not eager to engage in battle, fortifying in Talca. However, after a suggestion from Colonel Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Ord&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F1&gt;ez a confrontation was decided upon, under Ordo&lt;U+00F1&gt;ez' command. In a bold move, Ordo&lt;U+00F1&gt;ez made the kind of attack San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n had feared: circumventing the city and making a surprise attack at night behind the vanguard where the patriot forces were still taking positions. The surprise attack happened before the patriot army had re-positioned itself, and was a directed at the battalion under O'Higgins command, near San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's position. Soon, the vanguard soldiers dispersed, leaving O'Higgins in a bad position; his horse was shot dead and he was wounded in one arm. In an uncharacteristic move, instead of ordering retreat San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n held the position, which made more patriot soldiers flee under enemy fire, leaving weapons and supplies behind. After the initial disorder, however, he ordered retreat. The rear and reserves had already re-positioned, somewhat withstanding the attack, but had no-one in command (Colonel Hilari&lt;U+00F3&gt;n de la Quintana had left to headquarters to receive orders after the re-position and had not yet returned). Las Heras took command, and led the men during the retreat, while trying to recover as much artillery and weapons as possible. San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n and O'Higgins (who were also retreating at full speed) were being closely chased by royalist forces.
By 21 March 1818, the decimated patriot forces of around three and half thousand men reunited in San Fernando, while news of the defeat reached Santiago. Rumors of deaths of O'Higgins and San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n were spreading, and an exodus from Santiago to Mendoza started.
The battle (which was the only defeat the campaign had suffered) resulted in around 150 killed, and two hundred men taken prisoner. Several hundred had deserted, the whole artillery of the Argentine side was lost along with considerable amounts of horses, mules and weapons from both the Chilean and Argentine parts of the army. Despite the royalist victory, the action proved decimating to their side: two hundred soldiers had been killed, three hundred men captured and around six hundred had deserted, a total comprising more than half the two thousand men that had charged into the battle. Because of historical records these numbers cannot be completely accurate.
Battle of Maip&lt;U+00FA&gt;
  After the sorpresa de Cancha Rayada (surprise of Cancha Rayada), the royalist forces concentrated and marched towards Santiago. On 4 April 1818, the United Army took positions in Loma Blanca, near the Maip&lt;U+00FA&gt; plains. The army separated into three divisions: Las Heras commanding the column on the right, Colonel Rudecindo Alvarado commanding the column on the left, and Quintana at the rear. O'Higgins (still wounded) was in charge of the reserves.
The royalist forces under General Osorio's command took defensive positions, despite the convictions of some Colonels (among whom was Ordo&lt;U+00F1&gt;ez) that taking the offensive as in Cancha Rayada was the best option. According to Irish Mounted Granadier John Thomond O'Brien, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n, seeing Osorio's disposition of the forces, exclaimed &quot;Osorio is clumsier than I thought. Today's triumph is ours. The sun as witness!&quot;.
Around 11 am on the morning of 5 April 1818, the patriotic forces charged against the royalist forces with devastating resolution: after the sustained six-hour battle, the royalists were defeated. Osorio attempted to retreat to a property called Lo Espejos (The Mirrors) but failing to reach it, fled to Talcahuano with around twelve hundred men, although virtually rendered useless as they had lost most, if not all, of their weapons.
The royalist forces suffered two thousand dead, three thousand prisoners taken, and the loss of all its artillery. The patriotic forces, in contrast, suffered one thousand casualties. Historian and Colonel Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Luis Picciuolo stated in his book Argentina Cavalry in the History of the Army that &quot;this battle was executed as a typical act of annihilation&quot;.
As result of the battle, the Spanish control over southern Chile ended, and the independence declared on 12 February 1818 was partially accomplished. Viceroy Pezuela considered southern Chile lost, and Osorio set sail for Peru, leaving Colonel Juan Francisco S&lt;U+00E1&gt;nchez in charge of one thousand men in Talcahuano.
Fleet of the Pacific
Since the Battle of Chacabuco, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n had urged both governments of Santiago and Buenos Aires to build a fleet on the Pacific. Convoys had been sent to the United States and England in order to buy and hire several ships, however, lack of political cohesion in Argentina, a Spanish blockade in Valpara&lt;U+00ED&gt;so, and the Battles of Cancha Rayada and Maip&lt;U+00FA&gt; heavily delayed the project. On the other hand, the mountainous landscape of the region lent itself to a large dependence of the colonial Chilean economy on maritime trade routes and shipping. This meant that there was an abundance of shipyards and a ready supply of sailors.
Right after the Battle of Maip&lt;U+00FA&gt;, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n left for Buenos Aires in order to speed up the process (and meet his wife and daughter which he had not seen since the start of the Campaign of the Andes). Once in Buenos Aires, after learning the fact that half a million pesos would not be available for the project from Pueyrred&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n resigned as Commander of the Army under the pretext of being prescribed by his doctor to take rest in Chile's hotsprings. The resignation was not accepted and San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n was granted a license.
Act of Rancagua
After Supreme Director Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Rondeau was defeated in the Battle of Cepeda, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n sent his resignation of the Army's command from Santiago to Rancagua, where Colonel Las Heras had settled with the army, arguing that the authority to which he had to report had ceased to exist, and thus his own authority had expired. The officials of the army rejected his resignation on the basis that the army's goal was to hasten the happiness of the country and the authority was given ultimately by the health of the people, something that was immutable and could not expire.
Peru
On 20 August 1820, a fleet of eight warships and sixteen transport ships of the Chilean Navy, under the command of Thomas Alexander Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald, set sail from Valpara&lt;U+00ED&gt;so to Paracas, southern Peru.
On 7 September, the army landed on Paracas and successfully attacked Pisco. On 11 September 1820, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n sent a &quot;manifesto&quot; to the Peruvian people stating &quot;My announcement is not that of a conqueror that tries to create a new enslavement. I cannot help but be an accidental instrument of justice and agent of destiny. The outcome of victory will make Peru's capital see for the first time their sons united, freely choosing their government and emerging into the face of earth among the rank of nations&quot;.
Expedition of Peru
 While previous campaigns had been militaristic, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n avoided confrontation in Peru and emphasized diplomacy; the reason was that Lima, as the center of the Spanish Empire, would be more against the nationalist cause if its forces used violence and/or threatened to break the established monarchical-style order. Also, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's army was smaller than that of the royalist forces in Peru, and he was wary of attacking the Spanish head on. His strategy consisted of waiting for the Peruvian people to begin the uprising by themselves. This resulted in many diplomatic envoys to Lima, urging viceroy Joaqu&lt;U+00ED&gt;n de la Pezuela to grant the independence of Peru. However, these diplomatic efforts proved fruitless.
After seizing Pisco, the army set sail on 26 October toward the north and landed at Huacho &lt;U+2014&gt; a better place from a strategic point of view &lt;U+2014&gt; on 12 November. Huacho was used by San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n as his main headquarters from thereon. While there, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n first heard of the emancipation of Guayaquil under the leadership of Peruvian Gregorio Escobedo. This and other events such as the maritime blockade of Callao by Cochrane and the victories over royalists by Alvarez de Arenales in Guacarillo (6 October) and Pasco (20 December) strengthened the position of the main independentist effort led by San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n.
On 29 January, Pezuela was deposed by Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; de la Serna. On 21 February 1821, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n promulgated the Provisional Rules (Spanish, Reglamento Provisional) aimed to provide legal guarantees to the Peruvian citizens, and designed the first flag of Peru. Soon afterwards he started preparing to march on Lima.
In March, 1821 the army set sail and landed in Anc&lt;U+00F3&gt;n (near Lima), while dispatching general Guillermo Miller to the southern coasts and Alvarez de Arenales towards the eastern hills, furthering Lima's isolation. Diplomatic efforts once again failed, as Viceroy Serna did not agree to declare independence, and San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n did not accept Serna's proposal of acceptance by the independentists of the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and the sending emissaries to the Cortes Generales.
On 2 July, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n met Viceroy Serna. This time San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n proposed to create a constitutional monarchy with a European monarch to be appointed later. Serna, arguing that he did not have the power to make such a decision, asked for two days to discuss the issue. However, after discussing the issue with the royalist forces' commanders, the proposition was turned down on the basis that they did not have the power to grant independence, even to create a monarchy. On 8 July, Serna and his forces simply abandoned the city, in order to reinforce in the countryside.
Protector of Peru
 San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n occupied Lima, the capital of Peru, on 12 July 1821. This was a huge loss for the Spanish forces. Independence from Spain for Peru was finally declared on 28 July 1821 and he was voted the &quot;Protector&quot; of the newly independent nation. During the same year, he founded the National Library of Peru, to which he donated his collection of books, and praised the new library as &quot;... one of the most efficient means to spread our intellectual values&quot;. After Peru's parliament had been assembled, he resigned his command.
Meeting in Guayaquil

On 26 July 1822, he met with Sim&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var at Guayaquil to plan the future of Latin America. Most of the details of this meeting were secret at the time, and this has made the event a matter of much debate among later historians. Some believe that Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's refusal to share command of the combined forces made San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n withdraw from Peru and resettle as a farmer in Mendoza, Argentina. Another theory claims that San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n yielded to Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's energy and avoided a confrontation. Many argue that San Martin was a military genius but not as charismatic a leader, or as politically ambitious, as Bolivar.
Exile in Europe
 In 1824, soon after his return to Argentina, his wife Remedios de Escalada de San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n died. Then he moved to Europe with his daughter Mercedes, first to England, then to Brussels. To keep a neutral position during the 1830 Belgian Revolution he moved to Paris, where he contracted cholera. Cured but weakened, he bought a house and retired at Grand-Bourg, near &lt;U+00C9&gt;vry. His daughter married Mariano Antonio Severo de Balcarce, illegitimate son of Juan Manuel de Rosas, in Paris on 13 December 1832, and they had two daughters. In 1848, when the revolution started in Paris, he decided to move to London, but settled instead at Boulogne-sur-Mer4, where he spent the remainder of his days.
He always excluded himself from every possible meddling at the internecine wars of his native country, and refused several offers he had to do so. The only occasion in which he offered himself to return to Argentina was at the time of the French blockades of 1838 and 1845. In recognition of the successful defense of Argentine rights in those conflicts, he handed down his sword to Buenos Aires Province Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas through his will. He died on 17 August 1850 in Boulogne-Sur-Mer, France.
In 1880 his remains were taken from Brunoy to Buenos Aires and reinterred in the Buenos Aires Cathedral. The mausoleum also has the remains of Generals Juan Gregorio de las Heras and Tom&lt;U+00E1&gt;s Guido, as well as those of the Unknown Soldier of the Independence.

Anthem to San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n
Anthem to the Liberator General San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n
Music: Arturo Luzzatt Lyrics: Segundo M. Argara&lt;U+00F1&gt;az






Yerga el Ande su cumbre m&lt;U+00E1&gt;s alta,
D&lt;U+00E9&gt; la mar el metal de su voz,
y entre cielos y nieves eternas
se alce el trono del Libertador.
Suenen claras trompetas de gloria
y levanten un himno triunfal,
que la luz de la historia agiganta
la figura del Gran Capit&lt;U+00E1&gt;n.
De las tierras del Plata a Mendoza,
de Santiago &lt;U+00E0&gt; la Lima gentil,
fue sembrando en la ruta laureles
a su paso triunfal San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n.
San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n, el se&lt;U+00F1&gt;or en la guerra,
por secreto designio de Dios,
grande fue cuando el sol lo alumbraba,
y m&lt;U+00E1&gt;s grande en la puesta del Sol.
&lt;U+00A1&gt;Padre augusto del pueblo argentino,
h&lt;U+00E9&gt;roe magno de la libertad!
A su sombra la Patria se agranda
en virtud, en trabajo y en paz.
&lt;U+00A1&gt;San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n! &lt;U+00A1&gt;San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n! Que tu nombre,
honra y prez de los pueblos del Sur,
asegure por siempre los rumbos
de la Patria que alumbra tu luz.







Rise the Andes its highest peak;
Give the sea the metal of his voice.
And between skies and everlasting snows,
shall arise the throne of the Liberator.
May trumpets of glory sound clearly
and play a triumphal anthem
because the light of history aggrandize
the figure of the Great Captain.
From the lands of River Plate to Mendoza,
from Santiago to genteel Lima,
he went, planting laurels along the way
in his triumphal journey, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n.
San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n, the lord of war,
by secret choice of God,
was great when the Sun was shining on him,
and even greater in the sunset.
Great father of the Argentine People,
Greatest hero of freedom!
beneath his shadow the fatherland grows
in virtue, in work, and in peace.
San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n! San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n! may your name,
the honour and glory of the people of the South,
assure for ever the fates
of the fatherland enlightened by your light.







San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n in popular culture
The first appearance of San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n in a movie was in the &quot;El himno nacional&quot; silent movie of 1908, being played by Federico L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez. This was followed by other short shots of specific events in the life of San Martin, which are currently lost. The first big movie was &quot;Nuestra tierra en paz&quot;, starred by Pedro Tossi.
The most famous movie of San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n is El Santo de la Espada from 1970, starred by Alfredo Alc&lt;U+00F3&gt;n. A new movie, San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n: El Cruce de los Andes, is currently being made and expected to be premiered in May 2010, during the bicentennial of Argentina.
