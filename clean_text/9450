 The Herdwick is a primitive breed of domestic sheep native to the mountainous Lake District of North West England, particularly Cumbria. Like much of the traditional language and culture of the Lake District, the ancestors of Herdwick sheep are thought to have been introduced by early Norse settlers. The name &quot;Herdwick&quot; is derived from the Old Norse &quot;herdvyck&quot;, meaning sheep pasture.1 Though low in lambing capacity and wool quality when compared to more common commercial breeds such as Merino sheep, Herdwicks are prized for their robust health, their ability to live solely on forage, and their tendency not to stray over the difficult upland terrain of the Lake Distict. An integral part of the cultural identity of the Lake District, the breed is for the most part found in the central and western dales of the region.
Severely threatened by the 21st century outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom, the breed has survived due to the intent to preserve this unique breed as a crucial part of traditional Lakeland agriculture. Still far less in number than most commercial breeds, Herdwicks survive largely due to farming subsidies and the aid of the British National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty.
History

The root word of the breed's name - herdvyck, meaning sheep pasture - is recorded in documents dated back to the 12th century. Like the word, the breed is thought to be of Norse origin; brought to the region somewhere between the 10th and 11th centuries during the Viking invasions of western England.2 3 Folklore alternatively posits that that breed was the offspring of sheep from a ship wrecked from the Spanish Armada, though there is no historical record to suggest this event ever occurred.4 5 For centuries, the husbandry of Herdwick sheep has been a large factor in shaping the culture and terrain of the Lake District. Topographically, the largely treeless hillsides of fells are the result of grazing, and the ubiquitous dry stone walls of the valleys were built to confine livestock. Linguistically, many words of Lakeland speech relate to sheep husbandry, and the ancient Yan Tan Tethera counting system was invented to tally them.6 
The beloved children's author Beatrix Potter was enthralled with keeping and breeding Herdwicks, even acting as president of the breed association for a time. Upon her death in 1943, she bequeathed fifteen farms - approximately a total sum of 4,000 acres - to the National Trust, and per her instructions all continue to graze Herdwick flocks.7
In the modern era, the main industry of the Lake District has shifted from agriculture to tourism. The subsequent influx of tourists to the District has at times conflicted with traditional life, including the raising of Herdwicks. One Lake District farmer summed the problem up as, &quot;We get 100,000 visitors across our land every year...If just one in a thousand forgets to shut a gate or can't be bothered, that's a hundred times we have to go out and round up our sheep.&quot;8
In the late 20th century, the keeping of Herdwicks became economically unviable without outside support; open market prices for Herdwick fleeces sometimes drop as low as a penny a kilo (which is about the weight of wool from a single sheep).9 Without direct monetary guarantees for wool prices from the National Trust, it actually costs farmers a considerably larger amount of money to shear their Herdwicks than they would receive in compensation; the majority of farmers once burned their fleeces as waste products.10 The Trust now acts as a wool merchant itself, thus being able to bargain for better prices directly with the British Wool Marketing Board and operate a Herdwick wool trademark.11 Most farmers survive through the sale of lambs, as well as both National Trust and European Union farm subsidies. Lake District farmers in particular receive subsidies for operating in a designated Less Favored Area from the England Rural Development Programme. Those who agree to maintain their land in accordance with sustainable farming practices also receive additional subsidies.12
The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001 led to the destruction of many flocks, and to fears for the survival both of the breed and of the typical Lakeland sheep farming industry.13 Of the estimated 100,000 Herdwick sheep present before the outbreak, a full 25% were lost. The call for vaccination rather than culling to preserve what is considered a part of the traditional identity of the fells and moors was led by parties - such as the Duke of Westminster, Earl Peel, Lord Barnard and Lord Lonsdale - who wished to save the hill sheep on their lands.14 Many Lake District residents saw the breed as an indispensible icon of the region. Longtime resident and writer for The Guardian A. Harry Griffin intimated this feeling:

There are other mountain sheep on the Lakeland fells, notably Swaledales and Rough-Fells, but the hardy Herdwick is the sheep most likely to be seen in and around the Duddon valley, the Coniston fells, the Buttermere fells and, through Borrowdale or Wasdale, up to the highest land in England, the Scafells. More than the old drystone walls that quarter the fells, the packhorse bridges or the whitewashed farmsteads, the little grey Herdwick sheep typify the Lakeland.


If they and their shepherds go, that is the end of the Lakeland where I have climbed, walked, skied and skated for nearly 80 years; of the Lakeland I have written about nearly all my life.15

The destruction of entire flocks meant that the shepherds were forced to undergo the process of again &quot;heafing&quot; their new sheep to the hills. Normally ewes teach this behaviour to their lambs, but with no more ewes left acquainted with a particular heaf the behavior had be taught all over again to new ewes which inevitably involved much rounding up of flocks that had strayed over the often inaccessible fells. Unheafed sheep would also undoubtedly cause much overgrazing by wandering if they replaced Herdwicks.16 17 The Cumbria Hill Sheep Initiative was been set up to &quot;reassess the position and circumstances&quot; in the aftermath of the disease; tough government restrictions in order to prevent another outbreak are still in place.18 19
Characteristics
thumb|A young Herdwick near Hardknott Pass. Herdwicks are a dual-purpose breed, producing a strong-flavoured meat and a coarse, grey wool. This slow to mature breed is considered by proponents to be the most hardy of all the British hill sheep breeds, withstanding the cold and relentless rain of the Lake District at heights in upwards of 3,000 feet.20 Their fleece - being grey in color and not fine - is best suited to use as carpet wool. The wool is also an excellent natural insulator; it is possible to buy sheets of fireproofed wool to fit as loft insulation.21 Herdwick lamb and mutton has a very distinct taste, and was even eaten at Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation banquet.22 Herdwick ewes also commonly produce desirable market lambs by cross-breeding with Suffolk, Cheviot, Charollais and Texel sheep.23
Most sheep spend winter on the fells, from approximately December to April. They are normally left to graze freely on the hillsides (without any additional feed), but tend to stay in their heaf, the natural home to which the flock will return every year. Due to the rough conditions on fells, lambing losses can be as high as 25%.24 This ability to thrive unassisted is part of the reason fell farmers so highly value Herdwicks over much higher-producing lowland breeds.25 For shows and auctions, Herdwicks traditionally have their wool &quot;ruddied up&quot; with dye. Rams are also ruddied when put out with the ewes to show which have been bred, and the dye is also one method - called a smit - of marking sheep for ownership. Before chemical dyes became available, this dye was made from either iron ore or graphite mixed with grease. The legal method of identifying a particular shepherd's sheep are notches cut out of a sheep's ear, called lug marks. Lambs are born with black faces and legs, and after a year lighten to a blue roan hue. Rams are horned, with ewes polled either manually or naturally.26 27
