On the Art of the Cinema (; lit. Film Art Theory), also known as The Theory of Cinematic Art, is a 1973 treatise by former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. It is considered the most authoritative work on North Korean filmmaking.
The book sets forth several original theories that can be applied to the practices of filmmaking, the arts, and beyond. These ideas complement the themes of nationalistic form and socialist content of films. Many ideas presented in the book are justifications for the creation of propaganda supporting the Workers' Party of Korea's policies.
On the Art of the Cinema had major political implications on the succession of Kim Jong-il as the supreme leader and formation of the Kim dynasty. Kim Jong-il gained political and cultural influence in North Korean society and government by authoring the book. Actual impact on North Korean films themselves, however, are disputed.
Background
After his graduation in 1964, Kim Jong-il engaged in cultural, ideological and propaganda work at the Department of Organization and Guidance of the Central Committee of the party. Kim Jong-il intervened at the annual film conference, the Aesthetic Review Meeting. Discussion on 'foreign' film concepts was banned, and the entire conference archive was ordered to be burned. Since then, Kim Jong-il's influence in film and literary administration grew, and he resisted liberal artistic influence from the de-Stalinizing Soviet Union. From 1968, Kim Jong-il began to work on the cinematic versions of the 1930s Manchurian guerilla plays. Kim Jong-il had personally taken part in the production of films, such as Sea of Blood, (parts one and two, 1969), The Fate of a Self-Defence Corps Man () (1970) and The Flower Girl (1972). Afterwards, Kim Jong-il began producing revolutionary operas. Having obtained around a decade of experience in the state arts bureaucracy, Kim Jong-il wrote a series of essays that were published as On the Art of the Cinema on April 11, 1973. Through the rest of the 1970s, Kim Jong-il continued to oversee cultural activities.
Ideas

In the treatise, Kim Jong-il seeks to apply the principles of the North Korean Juche ideology to questions of film, literature and art in general. According to Kim, &quot;revolutionizing&quot; cinema is a means of revolutionizing the whole of art and literature and exposing society to the Workers' Party's &quot;monolithic ideology&quot; and Juche. Building upon socialist realist literary theory and Kim Il-sung's thought, Kim constructs what has been described as a &quot;Juche realism&quot;. A key aim of Kim is to employ heroic film fiction to transform man into a socialist man: &quot;Juche-type man&quot;.
The book deals comprehensively with aspects of cinema, including film and literary theory, acting, performance, score music, the screen, camerawork, costumes, make-up and props. Of particular importance are themes of directing and producing as the driving forces of filmmaking. Two major theories presented in On the Art of the Cinema are the theory of literature as &quot;humanics&quot; and the &quot;seed theory&quot;. Both are considered justifications for the party's control over artistic creation. Other ideas developed by the treatise are the so-called &quot;modeling theory&quot; and &quot;speed campaign&quot;. Compliance with these principles earns an artwork the title of &quot;collective work&quot;.1
Films should be realistic, which is possible only when the filmmakers have lived with the popular masses, much like the ideal of the revolutionaries of the Korean resistance. However, this &quot;realism&quot; entails unadulterated worship for the leader and Juche, making it incomparable to conventional types of realism in film, like Italian neorealism. Kim builds on the idea that contemporary North Korea has transcended class conflict and no real conflicts exist to be portrayed in cinema, bar historical and external ones.2 This can be seen as a reassertion of the Stalinist Zhdanov Doctrine. No &quot;negative people&quot; who would find fault with the party's policies can exist. Depicting conflicts within North Korean society in film could be considered being critical of the regime.3 When historical themes are depicted, and traditions should be portrayed selectively to support present ideological needs, purged of &quot;feudal ideologies&quot; of traditional tales and legends.
Literature as humanics
The theory of literature as &quot;humanics&quot; (MR: ) developed by Kim establishes that literature exists within the human domain. A key theme of humanics is the question of good and worthy life, allowing for propagandist and moralistic art. The idea of  () is also prominent in the theory of humanics. Chajus&lt;U+014F&gt;ng is the metaphysical essence of humans who struggle against oppression. Philosophically, it depends on the indeterministic view on free will in Juche. The hero of the story in particular embodies Chajus&lt;U+014F&gt;ng. According to Kim, &quot;humanics literature&quot; gives emphasizes the development of truly independent individuals as called for by the Juche era. This brings about a transformation of the society as a whole. In North Korean literature, Chajus&lt;U+014F&gt;ng is used as a justification of state control on literary creation and a nationalistic program of socialism in one country.
The seed theory
The &quot;seed theory&quot; () forms the essence of On the Art of the Cinema and, consequently, North Korean film theory in general. It has been described as a &quot;strange concept&quot;, a coercive method of forcing artists to follow the party line, and a means of eliminating individual creativity. Kim Jong-il equates a film with a living organism, noting that in this analogy the seed is its kernel. The idea is that, if all artistic interpretation is done through a single ideological foundation, or &quot;seed&quot;, the resulting cinema is whole. This makes all members of a creative team work for a single goal, in spite of differences in personalities. The director's task is to prevent something foreign to the seed from entering cinema. The seed is the fundamental consciousness underlying artistic creativity.
In more concrete terms, the seed is the basis of the propaganda message of the film: &quot;a strong, convincing idea of what to tell&quot;. The seed synthesizes the subject matter and the idea of a work, thus providing both the form and content.4 The film should contribute to the ruling ideology and employ aesthetics and storytelling that support the propaganda message. For example, the seed of The Fate of a Self-Defence Corps Man could be described as &quot;whether or not Gap Ryong participates in the revolutionary movement, he dies&quot;. Surplus value, Kim argues, is the seed of Marx's Capital.5
The seed theory became influential in the literary circles of North Korea and writers sought to backtrack the seeds in classics preceding Kim's treatise.6 In addition to questions of art, the seed theory was adopted to a wider range of industrial and economic activities.7
Modeling theory and speed campaign
According to the &quot;modeling theory&quot;, liberation struggles should be portrayed so as to combine national and class struggle. This is achieved through idolizing portrayal of the North Korean people8 and by producing role-models.
The &quot;speed campaign&quot; (MR: ) calls for rapid production of films. According to Kim, by producing films as fast as possible, the overall revolutionary process is expedited.9 The origins of the speed campaign are in the shooting of The Fate of a Self-Defence Corps Man in just 40 days when it was anticipated to take a full year. The practice was carried out after publication of On the Art of the Cinema, too. For instance, the eight-part film series Unknown Heroes (1979-1981) was produced by following the speed campaign principle. Each film took just 45 days to produce. Subsequently speed campaigns have been carried out not only in art, but also economic matters. It was thought of as equally important with Kim Il-sung's Chollima movement, and remains an influential concept associated with Kim Jong-il's leadership.
Influence
 The work is considered the most authoritative guide on filmmaking in North Korea. However, the real extent of its influence is doubted. According to Johannes Sch&lt;U+00F6&gt;nherr, the work offers little new to North Korean cinema and many of the ideas presented are unoriginal and obvious, particularly to the specialist audience of professional filmmakers Kim Jong-il is writing for. Films from before and after the publication of the treatise are remarkably similar, suggesting that it had little impact on North Korean film industry in practice. Many traits of contemporary North Korean cinema, such as repetitiveness, slow editing style and old theatrical acting, go against the teachings of On the Art of the Cinema.10 Whatever change there was in North Korean cinema, can be attributed to political and economic pressures. Instead of contributing anything new, the work reformulates Kim Il-sung's ideas about the importance of film to art and as a propaganda tool. Rather than the theoretical breakthrough it is taught as, it is an account of Kim Jong-il's personal experiences in the film industry and an attempt to thwart sloppy practices.
According to Sch&lt;U+00F6&gt;nherr, Kim Jong-il himself considered his On the Art of the Cinema a failure, which directly prompted him to kidnap Shin Sang-ok in 1978.1112 Nevertheless, Shin reportedly studied On the Art of the Cinema to please Kim Jong-il with the kaij&lt;U+016B&gt; film Pulgasari,13 which credits Kim Jong-il as the executive producer.14
However, the treatise had political consequences. At the time of writing On the Art of the Cinema, Kim's father Kim Il-sung was systematically rallying support for the younger Kim to prepare for his succession. By authoring the work, Kim Jong-il gained social and political power, and secured Kim Il-sung's confidence, making the former's assuming of leadership of the country possible.
On the Art of the Cinema is mandatory reading for North Korean students of literature. The work's influence goes beyond North Korea as Australian Anna Broinowski directed Aim High in Creation!, a movie about making a propaganda film abiding by Kim Jong-il's instructions.15
