Being younger brother of the Emperor Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Th&lt;U+00E1&gt;nh T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng, Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t was one of the most important figures of Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n family and royal court during the reigns of four successive emperors Th&lt;U+00E1&gt;nh T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng, Nh&lt;U+00E2&gt;n T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng, Anh T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng and Minh T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng. In the second war of resistance against Mongol invasion, Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t was the general who commanded &lt;U+0110&gt;&lt;U+1EA1&gt;i Vi&lt;U+1EC7&gt;t army to defeat the navy of Mongol general Sogetu in Battle of H&lt;U+00E0&gt;m T&lt;U+1EED&gt;, one of the biggest victories of Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Dynasty. With his knowledge of numerous foreign languages and cultures, Prince Chi&lt;U+00EA&gt;u V&lt;U+0103&gt;n was also a prominent diplomat of Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Dynasty who helped the Emperor to maintain good relations with several ethnic groups in the northwestern region of &lt;U+0110&gt;&lt;U+1EA1&gt;i Vi&lt;U+1EC7&gt;t.
Background
Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t was born in 1255 as the sixth son of the Emperor Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Th&lt;U+00E1&gt;i T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng. According to &lt;U+0110&gt;&lt;U+1EA1&gt;i Vi&lt;U+1EC7&gt;t s&lt;U+1EED&gt; k&lt;U+00ED&gt; to&lt;U+00E0&gt;n th&lt;U+01B0&gt;, Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t was born with four characters &quot;Chi&lt;U+00EA&gt;u V&lt;U+0103&gt;n &lt;U+0111&gt;&lt;U+1ED3&gt;ng t&lt;U+1EED&gt;&quot; (&quot;pupil of Chi&lt;U+00EA&gt;u V&lt;U+0103&gt;n&quot;) in his arm,1 that's why he was entitled Prince Chi&lt;U+00EA&gt;u V&lt;U+0103&gt;n (Vietnamese: Chi&lt;U+00EA&gt;u V&lt;U+0103&gt;n v&lt;U+01B0&gt;&lt;U+01A1&gt;ng) in 1268.2 Besides the Emperor Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Th&lt;U+00E1&gt;nh T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng, Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t had two other famous elder brothers, Prince Chi&lt;U+00EA&gt;u Minh (Chi&lt;U+00EA&gt;u Minh v&lt;U+01B0&gt;&lt;U+01A1&gt;ng) Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Quang Kh&lt;U+1EA3&gt;i who was grand chancellor of royal court3 and Prince Chi&lt;U+00EA&gt;u Qu&lt;U+1ED1&gt;c (Chi&lt;U+00EA&gt;u Qu&lt;U+1ED1&gt;c v&lt;U+01B0&gt;&lt;U+01A1&gt;ng) Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n &lt;U+00CD&gt;ch T&lt;U+1EAF&gt;c who was broadly known not only for his intelligence4 but also for his notorious defection to Yuan side during the second Mongol invasion of &lt;U+0110&gt;&lt;U+1EA1&gt;i Vi&lt;U+1EC7&gt;t.5
Since he was young, Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t began to make friends with many foreigners from Champa or Song Dynasty with whom he could discuss by their own languages and customs.67 One of them was Tri&lt;U+1EC7&gt;u Trung, a refugee from China, who eventually became Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t's subordinate during the war against Yuan Dynasty.8 Prince Chi&lt;U+00EA&gt;u V&lt;U+0103&gt;n spoke foreign languages, even some exotic ones, so well that he was once mistaken as a Chinese by an Yuan ambassador.9
History
Diplomatic activities
Two years after the coronation of Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+00E2&gt;n T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng in 1278, head of &lt;U+0110&gt;&lt;U+00E0&gt; Giang Tr&lt;U+1ECB&gt;nh Gi&lt;U+00E1&gt;c M&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t rose a revolt against Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n rulers. Being an expert of minority people's language and culture, Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t was appointed by Nh&lt;U+00E2&gt;n T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng to take charge of pacifying this revolt by diplomatic means. At the age of 25, Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t went directly into the headquarters of Tr&lt;U+1ECB&gt;nh Gi&lt;U+00E1&gt;c M&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t with only several servants and discussed with the head of revolt by his own language and manner. Tr&lt;U+1ECB&gt;nh Gi&lt;U+00E1&gt;c M&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t and his men were so impressed by Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t that they decided to unconditionally surrender Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Dynasty and the revolt was since put down without any casualty. After the pacification, Tr&lt;U+1ECB&gt;nh Gi&lt;U+00E1&gt;c M&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t and his family were still well treated by Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t, therefore Prince Chi&lt;U+00EA&gt;u V&lt;U+0103&gt;n gradually became a respected figure among ethnic groups in the northwestern region.10
Military activities
In 1279, Yuan Dynasty had the decisive victory over Song Dynasty in Battle of Yamen which marked the end of Song Dynasty and the total control of Kublai Khan over China.11 As a result, Kublai Khan began to expose his attempt to take over the southern countries like &lt;U+0110&gt;&lt;U+1EA1&gt;i Vi&lt;U+1EC7&gt;t or Champa. In December 1284, the second Yuan's invasion of &lt;U+0110&gt;&lt;U+1EA1&gt;i Vi&lt;U+1EC7&gt;t was opended under the command of Kublai Khan's prince Toghan.12 &lt;U+0110&gt;&lt;U+1EA1&gt;i Vi&lt;U+1EC7&gt;t was attacked in two directions, Toghan himselft conducted the infantry invaded from the northern border while Yuan's navy under general Sogetu advanced from the sourthern border through Champa's territory.13 At the beginning of the war, Prince Chi&lt;U+00EA&gt;u V&lt;U+0103&gt;n took charge of a military base near the northern border, thanks to his accurate judgment, Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t's troops was able to escape the trap of Yuan army and successfully retreated.14 Ultimately Sogetu's army suffered heavy defeat in Battle of H&lt;U+00E0&gt;m T&lt;U+1EED&gt; where Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t commanded an allied troops of &lt;U+0110&gt;&lt;U+1EA1&gt;i Vi&lt;U+1EC7&gt;t soldiers and former Song refugees.151617
During the reign of Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Anh T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng, Prince Chi&lt;U+00EA&gt;u V&lt;U+0103&gt;n and general Ph&lt;U+1EA1&gt;m Ng&lt;U+0169&gt; L&lt;U+00E3&gt;o were responsible for the quelling some rebellions in northern region.18
In royal court
Holding several high positions during the reigns of four successive emperors Th&lt;U+00E1&gt;nh T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng, Nh&lt;U+00E2&gt;n T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng, Anh T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng and Minh T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng, Prince Chi&lt;U+00EA&gt;u V&lt;U+0103&gt;n became an important figures of both royal family and royal court, he was appointed as grand chancellor in 1302 during the reign of Anh T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng.19 Since the other sons of Anh T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng all died at a young age, the Emperor had Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t take the duty of bringing up crown prince Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n M&lt;U+1EA1&gt;nh, his only surviving son. Indeed Prince Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n M&lt;U+1EA1&gt;nh was well looked after due to the whohearted devotion of Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t and finally became the Emperor Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Minh T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng.20 It was also Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t and Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Qu&lt;U+1ED1&gt;c T&lt;U+00FA&gt; who assisted the 12-year-old Crown Prince Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n M&lt;U+1EA1&gt;nh in ruling the country when Anh T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng was away for a military campaign against Champa in 1312.21
Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t died in 1330 at the age of 77.22
Family
Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t had one wife, Lady Trinh T&lt;U+00FA&gt;c, who was of Thanh H&lt;U+00F3&gt;a origin, so his other concubines all came from Thanh H&lt;U+00F3&gt;a and descendants of Prince Chi&lt;U+00EA&gt;u V&lt;U+0103&gt;n were often appointed as officials in this region.23 The only son of Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t is Marquis C&lt;U+01B0&gt;&lt;U+01A1&gt;ng &lt;U+0110&gt;&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng V&lt;U+0103&gt;n Hi&lt;U+1EBF&gt;n (C&lt;U+01B0&gt;&lt;U+01A1&gt;ng &lt;U+0110&gt;&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng V&lt;U+0103&gt;n Hi&lt;U+1EBF&gt;n h&lt;U+1EA7&gt;u), who plotted with Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Kh&lt;U+1EAF&gt;c Chung the defamation campaign which led to the death of Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Qu&lt;U+1ED1&gt;c Ch&lt;U+1EA9&gt;n, father-in-law of the Emperor and prominent general, in order to keep the position of throne successor for prince Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n V&lt;U+01B0&gt;&lt;U+1EE3&gt;ng.24
Legacy
In his work &lt;U+0110&gt;&lt;U+1EA1&gt;i Vi&lt;U+1EC7&gt;t s&lt;U+1EED&gt; k&lt;U+00ED&gt; to&lt;U+00E0&gt;n th&lt;U+01B0&gt;, the royal historian Ng&lt;U+00F4&gt; S&lt;U+0129&gt; Li&lt;U+00EA&gt;n praised Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t as not only a capable official but also a gentleman of intelligence and culture. Despite holding high position in royal court for many years, Prince Chi&lt;U+00EA&gt;u V&lt;U+0103&gt;n always kept an amiable, tolerant attitude and was well-known as a scholar with wide knowledge. Therefore he was compared with Guo Ziyi, one of the greatest generals and mandarins in Chinese history.25 Modern opinions still consider Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t, together with Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n H&lt;U+01B0&gt;ng &lt;U+0110&gt;&lt;U+1EA1&gt;o and Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Quang Kh&lt;U+1EA3&gt;i, as the most important members of Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n clan who were credited with the victories over Yuan Dynasty and the prosperous situation in &lt;U+0110&gt;&lt;U+1EA1&gt;i Vi&lt;U+1EC7&gt;t afterwards. A main street in Hanoi and many places in Vietnam are named in honour of Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Nh&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t Du&lt;U+1EAD&gt;t.
