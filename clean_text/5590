It is also one of the coldest inhabited places in the world, with an average yearly temperature of -16.5 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit).

Grise Fiord is the northernmost civilian settlement in Canada, but was eclipsed by Alert eight hundred km north as the North America's northernmost community when Environment Canada and the Canadian Forces began to station permanent personnel there.
Located at the southern tip of Ellesmere Island, Grise Fiord is one of three permanent settlements on the island. Grise Fiord lies  north of the Arctic Circle.
Grise Fiord lies in the Arctic Cordillera mountain range which is the only major mountain system east of the Canadian Rockies.

Crime and safety
A Simon Fraser University study of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) activity in the Baffin Region states that Grise Fiord had the lowest rate of criminal offences of all communities looked at in 1992,2 and cites a 1994 Statistics Canada survey that gives the highest perception of personal safety.3
History
Settlement
  The settlement (and Resolute) was created by the Canadian government in 1953, partly to assert sovereignty in the High Arctic during the Cold War. Eight Inuit families from Inukjuak, Quebec (on the Ungava Peninsula) were relocated after being promised homes and game to hunt, but the relocated people discovered no buildings and very little familiar wildlife.4 They were told that they would be returned home after a year if they wished, but this offer was later withdrawn as it would damage Canada's claims to sovereignty in the area and the Inuit were forced to stay. Eventually, the Inuit learned the local beluga whale migration routes and were able to survive in the area, hunting over a range of 18,000 square kilometres (6,950 sq mi) each year.5
In 1993, the Canadian government held hearings to investigate the relocation program. The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples issued a report entitled The High Arctic Relocation: A Report on the 1953-55 Relocation, recommending a settlement.6 The government paid $10 million CAD to the survivors and their families, and gave a formal apology in 2008.7
In 2009, Looty Pijamini was commissioned by the Canadian Government to design a monument in memory of the relocation.8 Depicting a sad-looking woman with a young boy and a husky, the monument was unveiled by John Duncan, Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and Federal Interlocutor for M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis and Non-Status Indians, on September 10, 2010.910
Telephone network
 In 1970, Bell Canada established what was then the world's most northerly telephone exchange (operated since 1992 by Northwestel).
Naming
Grise Fiord means &quot;pig inlet&quot; in Norwegian and was named by Otto Sverdrup from Norway during an expedition around 1900. He thought the walrus in the area sounded like pigs. Grise Fiord's Inuktitut name is Aujuittuq which means &quot;place that never thaws.&quot;
