Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is an 2010 American action comedy film directed by Edgar Wright based on the comic book series Scott Pilgrim by Bryan Lee O'Malley. The film is about Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) meeting the girl of his dreams, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). In order to win Ramona over, Scott learns that he must defeat Ramona's seven evil exes, who are coming to kill him.
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World was planned as a film after the first volume of the comic was released. Director Wright became attached to the program and began filming in March 2009 in Toronto, Ontario. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World premiered after a panel discussion at the San Diego Comic-Con International on July 22, 2010. It received a wide-release in North America on August 13, 2010.
Plot
The story begins in Toronto where Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera), the bass guitarist for the band &quot;Sex Bob-omb&quot;, begins dating high-schooler Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) despite the protests of his friends and bandmates. He later meets a mysterious American girl named Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and begins dating her, losing interest in Knives. Sex Bob-omb competes in a battle of the bands to win a record contract with the label G-Man when Scott is attacked by Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha), the first of Ramona's Seven Evil Exes who seek to control Ramona's love life. Scott defeats Matthew and learns from Ramona that, in order for them to continue dating, he must defeat each member of the League of Evil Exes.
After learning that popular actor and skateboarder Lucas Lee (Chris Evans), the second evil ex, is coming to Toronto to film a movie, Scott is forced to break up with Knives, who is devastated and tries everything she can to win him back. Scott successfully defeats Lee by tricking him into performing a dangerous skateboard stunt where he crashes and dissolves into coins. He encounters the third evil ex, Todd Ingram (Brandon Routh), who serves as bass guitarist for Scott's ex-girlfriend Envy Adams' (Brie Larson) band, &quot;The Clash at Demonhead&quot;. Todd initially overpowers Scott using his psychic vegan abilities, which are stripped from him by the &quot;Vegan Police&quot; after Scott tricks him into drinking coffee with half and half, allowing Scott to win the fight.
Following the defeat of the fourth evil ex Roxy Richter (Mae Whitman), Scott's relationship with Ramona begins to falter as he grows increasingly upset with her dating history. During the second round of the battle of the bands, Sex Bob-omb faces off against the fifth and six evil exes, twin Katayanagi brothers, Kyle (Shota Saito) and Ken (Keita Saito), earning Scott an extra life upon their defeat. During the battle, Scott sees Ramona together with her seventh and final evil ex, Gideon Graves (Jason Schwartzman), who turns out to be Sex Bob-omb's sponsor G-Man. Ramona breaks up with Scott as she is unable to leave Gideon's side due to a chip in the back of her head, and Scott leaves Sex Bob-omb as they sign on to play at Gideon's new club, the Chaos Theatre.
Scott goes to the club and professes his love for Ramona, gaining the &quot;Power of Love&quot; sword which he uses to fight Gideon. Knives arrives to battle Ramona over Scott who, while trying to break up the girls' fight, accidentally reveals that he cheated on both of them with each other before he is killed by Gideon. Scott uses his extra life to restart his battle with Gideon, this time resolving his issues with his friends and owning up to his own faults, gaining the even stronger &quot;Power of Self-Respect&quot; sword and defeating Gideon alongside Knives. Free from Gideon's control, Ramona encourages Scott and Knives to stay together while she prepares to leave to start over. Upon Knives' insistence, Scott instead follows Ramona as he always wanted, and the two begin their relationship anew.

Production
Development
After artist Bryan Lee O'Malley completed the first volume of Scott Pilgrim, his publisher Oni Press contacted producer Marc Platt with the proposition for a film version.3 Universal Studios contracted Edgar Wright who had just finished his last film, Shaun of the Dead, to adapt the Scott Pilgrim comics.45 O'Malley originally had mixed feelings about a film adaptation, stating that he &quot;expected them to turn it into a full-on action comedy with some actor that I hated...I didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t even care. I was a starving artist, and I was like, 'Please, just give me some money.'&quot;6
In May 2005, the studio signed Michael Bacall to write the screenplay for the adaptation.7 By January 2009, filmmakers rounded out its cast for the film, now titled Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.8 Edgar Wright does note that O'Malley was &quot;very involved&quot; with the script of the film from the start, and even contributed lines to and &quot;polished&quot; certain scenes in the film. Likewise due to the long development process several lines from the various scripts written by Wright and Bacall ended up in books four and five as well.9
O'Malley confirmed that no material from Scott Pilgrim's Finest Hour, the sixth Scott Pilgrim volume, would appear in the film, as production had already begun. While he had given ideas and suggestions for the final act of the film, he admitted to that some of those plans might change throughout the writing process and ultimately stated that &quot;Their ending is their ending&quot;.10 O'Malley gave Wright and Bacall his notes for the sixth book while filming took place.11
In the film's original ending, written before the release of the final Scott Pilgrim book, Scott ultimately gets together with Knives. In the book series and the final film, Scott and Ramona get together.12
Casting
Director Wright felt confident with his casting in the film. Wright stated that &quot;Like with Hot Fuzz how we had great people in every single tiny part, it's the same with this. What's great with this is that there&lt;U+2019&gt;s people you know, like with Michael [Cera] and Jason [Schwartzman], and then we have people who are up and coming, like Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza and Brie Larson, and then there&lt;U+2019&gt;s complete unknowns as well&quot;.13 There was no studio interference with casting more unknowns, as Wright stated that &quot;Universal never really gave me any problems about casting bigger people, because in a way Michael [Cera] has starred in two $100 million-plus movies, and also a lot of the other people, though they're not the biggest names, people certainly know who they are.&quot;14 Wright planned on casting Michael Cera while writing Hot Fuzz after watching episodes of Arrested Development.15 Wright said he needed an actor that &quot;audiences will still follow even when the character is being a bit of an ass.&quot;16 Edgar Wright ran all his casting decisions by O'Malley during the casting session.17 Mary Elizabeth Winstead was Wright's choice for Ramona Flowers two years before filming had started, because &quot;she has a very sunny disposition as a person, so it was interesting to get her to play a version of herself that was broken inside. She's great in the film because she causes a lot of chaos but remains supernaturally grounded.&quot;18 Ellen Wong auditioned for the part of Knives Chau three times. On her second audition Edgar Wright was surprised to find that that she had a green belt in taekwondo which surprised him that this &quot;sweetfaced young lady being a secret badass&quot;.19

Music
Nigel Godrich, Beck, Metric, Broken Social Scene, Cornelius, Dan the Automator, Kid Koala, and David Campbell all contributed to the film's soundtrack.23242526 Two unreleased songs by Beck (who composed the music played by Sex Bob-omb in the film) are heard in the teaser trailer.27 Brendan Canning and Kevin Drew of Broken Social Scene wrote all the songs for Crash and the Boys. The tracks were sung by actor Erik Knudson, who plays Crash in the film. Drew stated that the reason behind this was that &quot;[he] knew that [Knudson] didn't need to be a singer to pull [it] off&quot; because the songs were &quot;so quick and punk and fast&quot; and &quot;it needed to be the character's voice.&quot;28 Metric are the influence of the band Clash at Demonhead in the film and have contributed the song &quot;Black Sheep&quot; to the film. The clothing of Metric's lead singer, Emily Haines, is the basis for the clothing of the lead singer of Clash at Demonhead.29 Chris Murphy of the band Sloan was the guitar coach for the actors in the film.30 Music from The Legend of Zelda video game series is used in a dream sequence in the film. To get permission to use the music, Edgar Wright sent a clip of the film and wrote a letter to Nintendo that described the music as &quot;like nursery rhymes to a generation.&quot;31

Reception
At a test screening, director Kevin Smith was impressed by the film saying &quot;That movie is great. It's spellbinding and nobody is going to understand what the fuck just hit them. I would be hard pressed to say, 'he's bringing a comic book to life!' but he is bringing a comic book to life.&quot;51 Smith also said that fellow directors Quentin Tarantino and Jason Reitman were &quot;really into it&quot;.52
After premiere screenings at the San Diego Comic-Con International, the film received mixed reviews. Variety gave the film a mixed review, referring to the film as &quot;An example of attention-deficit filmmaking at both its finest and its most frustrating&quot; and that &quot;anyone over 25 is likely to find director Edgar Wright's adaptation of the cult graphic novel exhausting, like playing chaperone at a party full of oversexed college kids.&quot;53 The Hollywood Reporter wrote a negative review, stating that &quot;What's disappointing is that this is all so juvenile. Nothing makes any real sense...[Michael] Cera doesn't give a performance that anchors the nonsense.&quot; and &quot;Universal should have a youth hit in the domestic market when the film opens next month. A wider audience among older or international viewers seems unlikely.&quot;54 IGN gave the film a positive rating of eight out of ten calling the film funny and offbeat as well as noting that the film is &quot;best suited for the wired generation and those of us who grew up on Nintendo and MTV. Its kinetic nature and quirky sensibilities might be a turnoff for some.&quot;55
Response to the film post-premiere has been mostly positive. Review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes reports that 81% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 162 reviews, with an average score of 7.4 out of 10.56 Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 68%, based on 35 reviews.57
David Edelstein of New York Magazine wrote that &quot;The film is repetitive, top-heavy: Wright blows his wad too early. But a different lead might have kept you laughing and engaged. Cera doesn't come alive in the fight scenes the way Stephen Chow does in the best (and most Tashlin-like) of all the surreal martial-arts comedies, Kung Fu Hustle.&quot;58 Nick Schager of Slant Magazine gave the film a positive review of three and a half stars out of four, calling Edgar Wright an &quot;inspired mash-up artist, and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World may be his finest hybridization to date&quot;.59 A. O. Scott was his &quot;critics pick&quot;, stating &quot;There are some movies about youth that just make you feel old, even if you aren't...[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World] has the opposite effect. Its speedy, funny, happy-sad spirit is so infectious that the movie makes you feel at home in its world even if the landscape is, at first glance, unfamiliar.&quot;60
