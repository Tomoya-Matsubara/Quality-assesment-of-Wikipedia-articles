Schleck's breakthrough came in 2005, with three podium places in the last month of the season. He finished all three races behind Paolo Bettini (2004 Olympic Road Race winner) and Gilberto Simoni (two times Giro d'Italia winner), losing Z&lt;U+00FC&gt;ri-Metzgete to Bettini, the Giro dell'Emilia to Simoni, and finishing third behind both in the Giro di Lombardia.

Three days later he finished 4th in La Fl&lt;U+00E8&gt;che Wallonne after a vigorous ride up the Muur de Huy where Spanish rider Alejandro Valverde proved unbeatable. Schleck's form continued days later with the Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge&lt;U+2013&gt;Bastogne&lt;U+2013&gt;Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge race, where he rode at the front for much of the latter half and finished 7th.

He rode despite the injury and launched the decisive attack a few kilometers from the finish with Danilo di Luca. Di Luca attacked with one kilometer to go and Schleck faded to 3rd.

He could only manage 17th at the Tour de France but was part of the successful attack in the world championship, finishing fourth.

Only two riders were able to follow the two brothers when they attacked on the final hills of the day : Alejandro Valverde and Davide Rebellin. Andy had to let the other three riders go and finished 4th. In the final sprint Fr&lt;U+00E4&gt;nk came 3rd. In the Tour de Suisse Schleck crashed during a dangerous descent and fell into a ravine. Miraculously, he was mostly uninjured. A week later, Schleck became national champion of Luxembourg for the second time in his career. In the Tour de France 2008 he came 3rd in the first mountain stage. This took him to 2nd place in the overall classification, only one second behind the yellow jersey. Eight days later Schleck took the maillot jaune and the lead in the Tour after claiming the single second he needed to pass Cadel Evans.

Doping allegations

On 25 July 2008, one day prior to a decisive penultimate stage of the Tour de France 2008, the German daily newspaper S&lt;U+00FC&gt;ddeutsche Zeitung alleged a contact between Schleck and the infamous Spanish doctor Eufemiano Fuentes in December 2005. Authorities stated that no evidence had been obtained that would support such a claim.11 The allegations in connection with Schleck followed a series of strong performances of the rider who wore the yellow jersey over several days and whose father's car had been the subject of a detailed search by French customs authorities during the Tour.
Prior to the 2008 UCI Road World Championships in Varese, Italy, on 26 September 2008, the S&lt;U+00FC&gt;ddeutsche Zeitung published a further article on the connections between Schleck and Fuentes after claiming to have seen evidence on a bank transfer of &lt;U+20AC&gt;7000 from Schleck to a Swiss bank account linked to Fuentes. The existence of the evidence was revealed by German police and subsequently confirmed by Luxembourg prosecutors.12
Following Schleck's public admittance of such payment on 3 October 2008, Bjarne Riis and  decided to temporarily suspend Schleck from any further races until the outcome of the doping allegations towards Schleck would be fully clarified.13 Schleck was cleared from all allegations by the doping authorities of Luxembourg at the beginning of December.
