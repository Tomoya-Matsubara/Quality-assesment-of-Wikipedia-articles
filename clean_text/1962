 &quot;El Curruch&lt;U+00E1&gt;&quot;' is a well-known Venezuelan folk song in the joropo tradition, composed by Juan Bautista Plaza with lyrics by Vincente Emilio Sojo. 1
After its premire in 1928 the piece became quite popular, in part because of its connection with joropo. It is lighter than much of Plaza's work; he never intended it to be viewed as art music, but as a popular piece, and later referred to it as &quot;a little youthful sin.&quot; 2
It has been performed by singer Jes&lt;U+00FA&gt;s Sevillano, the Quinteto Contrapunto vocal ensemble, and flutist Hu&lt;U+00E1&gt;scar Barradas, among others.
