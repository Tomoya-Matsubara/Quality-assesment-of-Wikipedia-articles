Ibba played eight season at second tier in Norway with Skeid, Notodden, Mj&lt;U+00F8&gt;ndalen and Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;mmen before he signed with the Tippeligaen-side V&lt;U+00E5&gt;lerenga in 2012. Ibba is one of the key players in the Norwegian futsal team.
Football career
Ibba was born to Moroccan parents and moved to Norway when he was one month old.1 He played at V&lt;U+00E5&gt;lerenga and Moss during his youth,23 and later joined Skeid because his friends were playing there.4 At Skeid he was teammate with Moa, Mos, Birger Madsen and Dawda Leigh.5
Ibba didn't get too much playing time with Skeid, but during the second half of the 2004-season he played 248 minutes in nine matches in the First Division and scored two goals. Ahead of the 2005-season, Ibba and his teammate Moa joined Rosenborg BK on their pre-season tour to La Manga.6 Ibba was sent on a short loan-spell to Dr&lt;U+00F8&gt;bak-Frogn in 2005,7 and left Skeid after the season and signed a one-year contract with S&lt;U+00F8&gt;rumsand which had been relegated from the Third Division.8
Before he played a match for S&lt;U+00F8&gt;rumsand, Ibba moved to Borussia M&lt;U+00F6&gt;nchengladbach9 where J&lt;U+00F8&gt;rn Andersen was the assistant coach. Ibba and Andersen communicated with eachother in Norwegian. A year later Andersen was fired together with the head coach, and the new coach only talked to Ibba in German, a language Ibba did not try to learn, and eventually Ibba requested to terminate his contract and moved home to Norway.10 He only played one match for Borussia M&lt;U+00F6&gt;nchengladbach II.11
In 2007 Ibba was back in Skeid, before he signed a contract with Notodden ahead of the 2008-season.12 Ibba played regularly in the first-team until head coach Jan Halvor Halvorsen was fired halfway through the 2009-season. The new coach, Arne Sandst&lt;U+00F8&gt; placed him on the bench and Ibba left the club after the season. Ahead of the 2010-season, Ibba was on a trial with the Spanish second-tier club Elche and was offered a contract there, but Ibba rejected the offer and decided to move to Mj&lt;U+00F8&gt;ndalen instead.13 Mj&lt;U+00F8&gt;ndalen's coach Vegard Hansen stated that Ibba was a risky signing due to his poor reputation, but that the 24-year had a such an unredeemed potential that he couldn't ignore him.14
Ibba played for Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;mmen in 2011, where he scored seven goals in 24 matches in Adeccoligaen,15 and ahead of the 2012-season he signed for V&lt;U+00E5&gt;lerenga.1617 After Ibba's transfer to V&lt;U+00E5&gt;lerenga, his former team mate from Skeid and former V&lt;U+00E5&gt;lerenga-player, Moa, said in an interview with Norwegian TV2 that the supporters of V&lt;U+00E5&gt;lerenga should be excited about their new signing and dubbed Ibba as one of the best newcomers of the 2012 Tippeligaen.18 Ibba made his first-team debut for V&lt;U+00E5&gt;lerenga in the friendly match against the Second Division-side Nesodden on 11 January 2012.19
