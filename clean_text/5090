Symphonic Fantasies: Music from Square Enix was an award winning symphonic tribute concert held in Cologne, Germany on the September 12, 2009 featuring video game music from Japanese game developer Square Enix. The concert featured symphonic movements based on the Kingdom Hearts series, Secret of Mana, the Chrono series, and the Final Fantasy series. The concert was produced and directed by Thomas B&lt;U+00F6&gt;cker, with arrangements provided by Finnish composer and musician Jonne Valtonen with assistance by Roger Wanamo. Due to overwhelming demand, a second concert was necessitated at the K&lt;U+00F6&gt;nig-Pilsener-Arena in Oberhausen, on September 11, 2009. The concert was performed by The WDR Radio Orchestra Cologne and the WDR Radio Choir Cologne under conduction from Arnie Roth, with guest performers Rony Barrak and Benyamin Nuss joining the orchestra. Symphonic Fantasies was broadcasted over radio on the WDR4 station and streamed live video online.
In 2012, 4 new performances were scheduled, taking stage in Tokyo, Stockholm, and a reprise in Cologne. The original concert and the Tokyo concert both sparked the release of an album. These albums, along with the concerts themselves, were heavily praised, both for the quality of the performance and for the quality of Valtonen's arrangements, which overlaid themes from multiple pieces rather than relying on a traditional medley.

Production
Thomas B&lt;U+00F6&gt;cker and then WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne director Winfried Fechner began collaborating on orchestrated video game concerts in 2007, after Fechner had attended the Fifth Symphonic Game Music Concert held in Leipzig.1 As their ideas and plans materialized, three projects were set in motion to determine the interest of a younger audience in classical music performance and the aptitude of the WDR orchestra in focusing on a new source of compositions. The first project was PROMS: That's Sound, That's Rhythm, held in early 2008, featuring a mixture of classical works and video game music, ranging from works by Ralph Vaughan Williams and Morton Gould as well as arrangements of music from video games such as Shenmue and Castlevania previously featured in the Symphonic Game Music Concerts. The second project, held in August 2008, was a composer specific concert titled Symphonic Shades - H&lt;U+00FC&gt;lsbeck in Concert, focusing entirely on the works of German video game composer Chris H&lt;U+00FC&gt;lsbeck.2 After the concert, Fechner revealed in an interview the existance of the third project, saying that he and B&lt;U+00F6&gt;cker would be involved in another concert of video game music the following September.3 The third project was to be a concert of music from one game company, focusing on multiple titles released by the same developer.4 This company was later confirmed to be Square Enix when Fechner announced Symphonic Fantasies as a video game music concert to take place on September 12, 2009. A website was set up for announcements, interviews and other concert information.5
 B&lt;U+00F6&gt;cker later explained that the decision to focus on Square Enix was made due to the large library of games to choose from, all of which he felt had a distinct sound, and many of which were very well known in Germany. An emphasis was put on balancing out the concert program and the arrangements, so that the music would appeal to first-time listeners, classical music fans, and longtime gamers. The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II from the Kingdom Hearts series, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross from the Chrono series, and the Final Fantasy series. In order to select the pieces presented, the original composers were consulted to assemble a list of their personal favorites.6 The composers were Yoko Shimomura for the music of Kingdom Hearts, Hiroki Kikuta for the music of Secret of Mana, Yasunori Mitsuda for the music of Chrono Trigger and Cross, and Nobuo Uematsu for the music of the Final Fantasy series.7
 For the concert, Jonne Valtonen returned as the lead arranger; he had previously been the arranger for video game music concerts since 2005, including Symphonic Shades. He was given complete freedom to arrange the music based on the general outline given to him by B&lt;U+00F6&gt;cker. Valtonen spent six months on the arrangements, during which Valtonen studied each song and referred to the composer's original intended expression.8 No Japanese guest arrangers were used for this concert in order to maintain a unique European take on the source material, but Valtonen brought in former classmate and close friend Roger Wanamo to assist on the arrangement of the music from the Chrono games.910 This was Wanamo's first time arranging video game music.11 On March 9, 2009 It was also announced that Valtonen had additionally been commissioned to compose an original fanfare to be played at the start of the concert, and with a video preview of his composition was released.12
The arrangements in the concert were structured as suites, dubbed &quot;Fantasies&quot;, with multiple songs from each game series positioned and arranged together to tell melodic stories rather than using the conventional medley structure more commonly heard in video game music arrangements.13 The fanfare, titled Fanfare Overture, was done in a style of traditional fanfares with some accentuated textures in order to introduce all the elements of the orchestra. The Kingdom Hearts suite featured seven songs from the two titles, and was arranged as a romantic piano concerto.1415 Secret of Mana featured six songs featured in the original game.16 The arrangement made use of notable unique techniques in order to replicate the atmosphere found in the original game; for example, the choir was used to create &quot;sound effects&quot; such as floor vibration by foot stomping and simulating distant rain with their voices.17 The Chrono suite featured ten songs from Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross.18 The suite featured a &quot;crossing&quot; of melodies, in which multiple melodies would be layered on top of one another, resulting in different well-known themes performed simultaneously in harmony.19 The Final Fantasy suite contained eight songs from the first seven titles in the series. Unlike the other suites, it featured a simpler structure, focusing more on each individual theme rather than overlapping multiple pieces.20
Original performance
 The orchestra received about two weeks of rehearsal time prior to their performances, more than any other game concert before.21 The concert was originally scheduled to be performed on September 12, 2009 in the Cologne Philharmonic Hall in Cologne, but once the tickets were sold out, a second performance was added for September 11, 2009 at the K&lt;U+00F6&gt;nig Pilsener Arena in Oberhausen. Ticket sales for the initial concert began on January 17, and half of them were sold within a week, with the remainder sold by April 2, 2009.22 The concert was preceded by a Meet and Greet session that included the original composers as well as the arrangement team and guest artists for the show. The concerts were performed by the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne and WDR Radio Choir Cologne, conducted by Arnie Roth.23
Before each suite, the moderator would introduce the upcoming musical piece, as well as introduce the composer in attendance. Each &quot;Fantasy&quot; lasted for more than 15 minutes each. The Kingdom Hearts suite featured solo pianist Benyamin Nuss. For the Chrono suite, Rony Barrak joined the orchestra and performed on his signature darbuka. A surprise encore was performed after the final suite, which took the from of a medley of the final boss themes from each game. Rony Barrak returned on stage as a soloist for the encore.24 No video screens or other form of tools were used during the concert, with only minimal lighting effects at certain parts for atmosphere being employed. The event was broadcast live on the WDR4 radio station, as well as through an online video stream, enabling a worldwide audience to watch the concert.25
2012 performances
Three years after the original performance, on September 14, 2011, during the Tokyo Game Show, Square Enix Japan announced on their website that the Symphonic Fantasies concert would be performed in Tokyo on January 7 and 8, 2012. They also announced that Benyamin Nuss, Rony Barrak, Jonne Valtonen, Roger Wanamo and Thomas B&lt;U+00F6&gt;cker would be in attendance. B&lt;U+00F6&gt;cker returned to produce the event, and Nuss and Barrak returned as soloists.26
The concerts were held at the Tokyo Bunka Kaikan Main Hall, and were performed by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra and the Tokyo Philharmonic Chorus. The concerts were conducted by Eckehard Stier. In addition to the originally announced attendees, in attendance were guest of honors Hiroki Kikuta, Yoko Shimomura, and Yasunori Mitsuda, as well as guests such as video game composers Takenobu Mitsuyoshi, Masashi Hamauzu, and Mahito Yokota. The concerts were featured extensively in the February issue of Famitsu as well as on their official website.27 Symphonic Fantasies Tokyo was the first all-European video game concert production to take place in Japan. More than 4000 fans were in attendance.28 The arrangements and tempo were slightly modified from the original concert, and the encore was modified to add elements from an additional Final Fantasy song.2930
At the conclusion of the Symphonic Odysseys concert in Cologne by Merregnon Studios on July 9, 2011, the WDR announced that Symphonic Fantasies would return to Germany in 2012. The concerts were held on July 6 and 7, 2012 at the Cologne Philharmonic Hall. The concert was again performed by the WDR Radio Orchestra Cologne and WDR Radio Choir Cologne, conducted by Niklas W&lt;U+00ED&gt;llen. On March 26, 2012, Merregnon Studios announced that Symphonic Fantasies would also be performed at the Stockholm Concert Hall on June 9, 2012. The concert was performed by Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra and Katarina Choir, conducted by Andreas Hanson.31

Each arrangement took listeners on an extended journey through the atmospheres, emotions, and melodies of their respective series.&quot;45 Polish site GameMusic.net's Kamil Rojek said in his report that &quot;Symphonic Fantasies is a significant turning point in the history of video game music concerts. It was a remarkable event that made great progress in breaking the boundaries between game music and traditional classical works.&quot;46
The composers themselves expressed great regard for the concert and the arrangement. Yoko Shimomura noted she was extremely pleased with Valtonen's arrangement of Kingdom Hearts, feeling it &quot;very colorful and beautiful, just superb really&quot;.47 Hiroki Kikuta stated that Valtonen's arrangement &quot;defied the framework of regular orchestra and was a very experimental attempt,&quot; resulting in &quot;free and unbound expression&quot;.48 Yasunori Mitsuda expressed that he was &quot;really amazed by its fantastic quality&quot;,49 and Nobuo Uematsu said that it was &quot;an exceptionally well-produced concert compared to most game concerts.&quot;50 The composers also voiced their desire to bring the concert to Japan.51
The Symphonic Fantasies album garnered universal praise upon its release. Patrick Gann of RPGFan said of the album &quot;this is the best game music arranged album of 2010. It may be the best in years, with the only things rivaling it being other recordings from the WDR.&quot;52 Audun Sorlie of Original Sound Version said of the album in his review &quot;It truly is the best symphonic game arrangement CD you can get your hands on.&quot; and further added &quot;For every game music fan out there, especially the ones with a taste for Square Enix, this is the definitive pick for you.&quot;53 Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online gave the album the score of 10 out of 10, and stated &quot;[Symphonic Fantasies] offers a definitive tribute to Square Enix. The album therefore certainly deserves a perfect score and an unconditional recommendation.&quot;54 Benjamin Schm&lt;U+00E4&gt;dig of the German site 4players.de said of the album &quot;Symphonic Fantasies represents memories of great emotional moments. The orchestra and choir put in all their strength, all their subtlety in these moments.&quot; He further complimented Jonne Valtonen, saying that he &quot;knows exactly how to arrange the known motifs in such an imaginative way that they tell the familiar stories from scratch.&quot;55 Denis Brown of ONLINEWELTEN said &quot;For Square Enix fans, it is an obligatory purchase&quot;.56 The album won the award &quot;Best Arranged Album&quot; in Square Enix Music Online's Game Music Awards 2010.57
