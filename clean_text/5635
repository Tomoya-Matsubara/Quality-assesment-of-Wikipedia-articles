Route 41 is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs 1 from the five-way intersection of Route 47 (Delsea Drive), County Route 603 (Fairview-Sewell Road/Blackswood-Barnsboro Road), and County Route 630 (Egg Harbor Road), also known as Five Points2, in Deptford Township, Gloucester County to the southern terminus of County Route 611 in Maple Shade,Burlington County, just north of the Route 41's interchanges with Route 38 and Route 73. The route is a two- to four-lane suburban road that passes through several communities, including Runnemede, Haddonfield, and Cherry Hill Township.3 Between the intersection with Route 168 in Runnemede and Route 154 in Cherry Hill Township, Route 41 is maintained by Camden County and is also signed as County Route 573.45
Route 41 was legislated in 1927 to run from Route 47 in Fairview, Deptford Township to Route 38 in Moorestown.67 Originally, the route was intended to bypass Haddonfield, however this bypass was never fully completed and Route 41 was signed along a temporary county-maintained alignment that also became County Route 573. The northern part of this bypass was completed and became Route 154 in 1953. The road has seen many changes including the replacement of the traffic circle with Routes 38 and 73 with an interchange that involved realigning Route 41 around the original circle in 1960 and the replacement of the Ellisburg Circle at Routes 70 and 154 with a signalized intersection in the early 1990s. The temporary alignment of Route 41 along County Route 573 was made permanent in the early 2000s.8

History
Route 41 was legislated in 1927 to run from Route 47 in Fairview in Deptford Township to Route 38 in Moorestown along its current alignment, except through Haddonfield, which it was to bypass to the east.2425 Also legislated in 1927 was a spur of Route 41, Route S41, which was to run from the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge to Berlin. Later spurs of Route 41 included Route S41A, which was a southern extension of Route S41 from Berlin to Route 42 (now U.S. Route 322) in Folsom proposed in 1938 and Route S41N, a short route in Palmyra.26 In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Routes S41 and S41A became Route 73 and Route S41N became Route 155. Also, Route 41 was legislaied along a county-maintained temporary route between Route 168 in Runnemede and Route 70 in Cherry Hill Township, signed Route 41 Temporary, when it became the apparent the bypass around Haddonfield would not be fully completed. Only the northermost section of the bypass between County Route 561 and Route 70 had been built and this became Route 154. The county-maintained section of Route 41 also became known as County Route 573.27
Since 1953, many changes have occurred along Route 41. Following reconstruction of the traffic circle between Routes 38, 41, and 73 into an interchange in 1960, Route 41 was relocated to a new alignment that bypassed the original traffic circle. In 1984, Route 41 was extended north a short distance on Kings Highway to just south of the County Route 608 (Lenola Road) intersection in Maple Shade Township.28 In the early 1990s, the Ellisburg Circle at the intersection of Routes 41, 70, and 154 was reconstructed into an intersection with jughandles and traffic lights. This reconstruction involved realigning Route 41 to form a brief concurrency with Route 154 just south of Route 70.29 In the early 2000s, the Route 41 interchange with Route 42 in Deptford Township was, along with the County Route 544 interchange with Route 42, reconstructed to ease traffic movements in the area.30 Around 2001, signs for Route 41 Temporary were replaced wirth normal Route 41 signs along the county-maintained portion of Route 41 concurrent with County Route 573.31 Signs for County Route 573 still remain along this stretch of Route 41.32
