 Solar powered flashlights are flashlights that can be powered through solar energy using solar cells as well as through batteries. Most of these flashlights also run on LED lights12 due to the low energy consumption cost.3
Features
The typical flashlight will have a charge time of about 6 hours while providing 8 hours of light. They can penetrate up to 50 meters in the dark, and can be visible up to 2 kilometers. The cell life of the solar energy cells can be as long as 20 years.4 Flashlights designed to be used in remote locations are sturdy, shockproof and weatherproof5 in addition to being able to float.6
Other models include a wide variety of other features including a built in solar cell phone charger7 AM/FM radio that has a high sensitivity the built-in FM antenna, a built in siren which sounds loud and clear to signal for help in an emergency, hand crank dynamo charging for use in night time etc., which can be used during camping, fishing, hunting, any indoor or outdoor sports, emergencies or blackouts.8
Battery life
To maximize your battery life on the solar flashlight, it is recommended that the battery be fully drained at least once a month. Doing so would erase any battery memory that is created from half-charges.9
Innovations
A solar powered torch the size of a credit card has been developed by a team of scientists from Denmark, the Netherlands and the US. This device combines 16 solar cells connected in series that are used to [Battery charging|charge]] a battery that powers a white light emitting diode. Production required 35 steps, and combined the polymer solar cell with printed circuitry and flexible lithium polymer batteries. Tests were run on the lamp to determine its efficiency and study the effects of humidity and design on performance. This pocket-sized flashlight was able to get a yield of 89 per cent and operated for hours at a time.10
Advantages

Solar powered lights prevents the need to constantly manually charge as in the case of conventional battery operated flashlights.11


Pollution from discarded batteries used in normal flashlights is eliminated.12


Solar powered flashlights are ideal for use in remote locations where it is impossible to find any source of electricity except for solar power.13

Significance
Solar powered flashlights have been distributed to countries where there is either none or erratic power supply, helping people feel safer leaving their homes at night, and giving children the opportunity to study after sunset.1415 A dual purpose solar flashlight, which also functions as a lamp has helped families in such countries spend more time together, surgeries to be performed during power outages and people to travel in the dark under a halo of light.161718
