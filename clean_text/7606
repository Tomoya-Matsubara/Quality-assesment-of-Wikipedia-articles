A martyr (Greek: &lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03AC&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03C5&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt;, m&lt;U+00E1&gt;rtys, &quot;witness&quot;; stem &lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03AC&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03C5&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;-, m&lt;U+00E1&gt;rtyr-) is somebody who suffers persecution and death for refusing to renounce, or accept, a belief or cause, usually religious.
Meaning
In its original meaning, the word martyr, meaning witness, was used in the secular sphere as well as in the New Testament of the Bible.1 The process of bearing witness was not intended to lead to the death of the witness, although it is known from ancient writers (e.g. Josephus) and from the New Testament that witnesses often died for their testimonies.
During the early Christian centuries, the term acquired the extended meaning of a believer who is called to witness for their religious belief, and on account of this witness, endures suffering and/or death. The term, in this later sense, entered the English language as a loanword. The death of a martyr or the value attributed to it is called martyrdom.
The early Christians who first began to use the term martyr in its new sense saw Jesus as the first and greatest martyr, on account of his crucifixion.234 The early Christians appear to have seen Jesus as the archetypical martyr.5
The word martyr is used in English to describe a wide variety of people. However, the following table presents a general outline of common features present in stereotypical martyrdoms.

Judaism

Martyrdom in Judaism is one of the main examples of Kiddush Hashem, meaning &quot;sanctification of God's name&quot; through public dedication to Jewish practice. Religious martyrdom is considered one of the more significant contributions of Hellenistic Judaism to Western Civilization. 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees recount numerous martyrdoms suffered by Jews resisting Hellenizing (adoption of Greek ideas or customs of a Hellenistic civilization) by their Seleucid overlords, being executed for such crimes as observing the Sabbath, circumcising their boys or refusing to eat pork or meat sacrificed to foreign gods. According to W. H. C. Frend: &lt;U+201C&gt;Judaism was itself a religion of martyrdom&lt;U+201D&gt; and it was this &lt;U+201C&gt;Jewish psychology of martyrdom&lt;U+201D&gt; that inspired Christian martyrdom.
Christianity


From the Gallery of 20th Century Martyrs at Westminster Abbey&lt;U+2014&gt;l. to r. Mother Elizabeth of Russia, Rev. Martin Luther King, Archbishop Oscar Romero and Pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer

In Christianity, a martyr, in accordance with the meaning of the original Greek martys in the New Testament, is one who brings a testimony, usually written or verbal. In particular, the testimony is that of the Christian Gospel, or more generally, the Word of God. A Christian witness is a biblical witness whether or not death follows.7 However over time many Christian testimonies were rejected, and the witnesses put to death, and the word martyr developed its present sense. Where death ensues, the witnesses follow the example of Jesus in offering up their lives for truth.
The concept of Jesus as a martyr has recently received greater attention. Analyses of the Gospel passion narratives have led many scholars to conclude that they are martyrdom accounts in terms of genre and style.8910 Several scholars have also concluded that Paul the Apostle understood Jesus' death as a martyrdom.111213141516 In light of such conclusions, some have argued that the Christians of the first few centuries would have interpreted the crucifixion of Jesus as a martyrdom.1718
In the context of church history, from the time of the persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire, it developed that a martyr was one who was killed for maintaining a religious belief, knowing that this will almost certainly result in imminent death (though without intentionally seeking death). This definition of martyr is not specifically restricted to the Christian faith. The first Christian witness to be killed for his testimony was Saint Stephen (whose name means &quot;crown&quot;), and those who suffer martyrdom are said to have been &quot;crowned.&quot; From the time of Constantine Christianity became the religion of the realm and there was less and less persecution. As some wondered how then they could most closely follow Christ there was a development of desert spirituality, desert monks, self mortification, ascetics, (Paul the Hermit, St. Anthony), following Christ by separation from the world. This was a kind of white martyrdom, dying to oneself every day, as opposed to a red martyrdom, the giving of ones life in a violent death.19
Some Christians view death in sectarian persecution, as well as religious persecution, as martyrdom. In Christian history, Foxe's Book of Martyrs recounts religious persecutions during the Protestant Reformation. Yet even more modern day accounts of martyrdom for Christ exist, shown in books such as Jesus Freaks.
The Lollards
 John Ball (c. 1338 &lt;U+2013&gt; 15 July 1381) was an English Lollard priest who took a prominent part in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. He gained considerable fame as a roving preacher &lt;U+2014&gt; a &quot;hedge priest&quot; without a parish or any cure linking him to the established order &lt;U+2014&gt; by expounding the doctrines of John Wycliffe, and especially by his insistence on social equality. His utterances brought him into conflict with Simon of Sudbury, then Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor. Ball was thrown into prison on three occasions. He also appears to have been excommunicated; owing to which, in 1366 it was forbidden to hear him preach. These measures, however, did not moderate his opinions, nor diminish his popularity; his words had a considerable effect in fomenting a riot which broke out in June 1381. Ball was in the archbishop's prison at Maidstone, Kent when the uprising began; he was quickly released by the Kentish rebels.20 He preached to them at Blackheath (the insurgents' gathering place near Greenwich) in an open-air sermon that included the following:

When Adam delved and Eve span, Who was then the gentleman? From the beginning all men by nature were created alike, and our bondage or servitude came in by the unjust oppression of naughty men. For if God would have had any bondmen from the beginning, he would have appointed who should be bond, and who free. And therefore I exhort you to consider that now the time is come, appointed to us by God, in which ye may (if ye will) cast off the yoke of bondage, and recover liberty.2122

When the rebels had dispersed, Ball was taken prisoner at Coventry, given a trial in which, unlike most, he was permitted to speak, and hanged, drawn and quartered in the presence of King Richard II on 15 July 1381, his head subsequently stuck on a pike on London Bridge. Ball, who was called by Froissart &quot;the mad priest of Kent,&quot; seems to have possessed eloquence and the gift of rhyme. He voiced the feelings of a section of the discontented lower orders of society at that time,23 who chafed at villeinage and the lords' rights of unpaid labour, or corv&lt;U+00E9&gt;e.
Islam

In Arabic, a martyr is termed shahid, &lt;U+0634&gt;&lt;U+0647&gt;&lt;U+064A&gt;&lt;U+062F&gt;. Shaheed appears in the Quran in a variety of contexts, including witnessing to righteousness , witnessing a financial transaction and being killed, even in an accident as long as it doesn't happen with the intention to commit a sin, when they are believed to remain alive making them witnesses over worldly events without taking part in them anymore (Quran 3:140). The word also appears with these various meanings in the hadith, the sayings of Muhammad.
Hinduism
Despite the promotion of ahimsa (non-violence) within Santana Dharma, there is also the concept of righteous (dharma), where violence is used as a last resort after all other means have failed. Examples of this are found in the Mahabharata. Upon completion of their exile, the Pandavas were refused the return of their portion of the kingdom by their cousin Duruyodhana; and following which all means of peace talks by Krishna, Vidura and Sanjaya failed. During the great war which commenced, even Arjuna was brought down with doubts, e.g., attachment, sorrow, fear. This is where Krishna instructs Arjuna how to carry out his duty as a righteous warrior and fight.
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; faith

In the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith, a martyr is one who sacrifices their life serving humanity in the name of God.24 However, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h, the founder of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith, discouraged the literal meaning of sacrificing one's life. Instead, he explained that martyrdom is devoting oneself to service to humanity.25
Sikhism

Martyrdom (called shaheed in Punjabi) is a fundamental concept in Sikhism and represents an important institution of the faith. The Sikh Gurus and Sikh with and after them are the biggest examples of martyrs. They fought against Mughal tyranny and oppression hence upholding the fundamentals of Sikhism. And in which their lives were taken. During protesting non-violently or in battles.
Bhagat Singh is usually interpreted in India as a Sikh martyr. Though there were many silent acts of martyrdom during the independence struggle of India against the British. It is usually considered that though being under 2% of India's population, Sikh contribution to Independence struggle against only British was more than 70% of the total figures. For instance, of 120+ people hanged, 90+ were Sikhs, out of 2200+ sent to life imprisonment 1900+ were Sikhs.
A larger contribution had come during the 18th century against Mughals and Afghans.
Chinese culture

Martyrdom was extensively promoted by the Tongmenghui and the Kuomintang party in modern China, revolutionaries who died fighting against the Qing dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution and throughout the Republic of China period, furthering the cause of the revolution, were recognized as martyrs.
Trade Union Martyrs
The Tolpuddle Martyrs were a group of 19th century agricultural labourers in Dorset, England, who were arrested for and convicted of swearing a secret oath as members of the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers. The rules of the society showed it was clearly structured as a friendly society, that is, a mutual association for the purposes of insurance, pensions, savings or cooperative banking; and it operated as a trade-specific benefit society. But at the time, friendly societies had strong elements of what are now considered to be the principal role of trade unions, and wages were at issue. The Tolpuddle Martyrs were sentenced to transportation to Australia, a harsh form of exile.26
