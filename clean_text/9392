The fourteenth legislative assembly election was held on 13 April 2011 to elect members from 234 constituencies in Tamil Nadu. Results were released on 13 May 2011. Two major parties Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) faced the election as coalitions of multiple parties with the DMK front consisting of 8 parties and the AIADMK of 11 parties. Vijayakanth's Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) which had contested the previous elections independently allied with AIADMK coalition. Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam boycotted the election following disagreement with Jayalalitha over seat-sharing. Tamil film actor Vijay for the first time was openly involved in Tamil Nadu politics by extending his support for ADMK.
The outgoing Karunanidhi government was noted for the construction of new assembly building in Chennai, execution of various developmental projects and implementation of new entitlement programs including free health care for the poor and issuance of a range of freebies such as color television to all. The numerous achievements of the administration was overshadowed by other major issues such as increasing prizes of essential items, 2G spectrum scam and undue influence of Karunanidhi's extended family in various aspects of Tamil politics and business.
The election commission enforced stringent measures to curb use of money power to bribe voters by paying them cash and stricter campaign descipline by imposing the 10 PM curfew. The commission headed by the chief election officer Praveen Kumar was commended for conducting the election in a strict and fair manner. The election recorded the highest polling ever in the state - 77.8% of the total electorate voted in the election surpassing 76.57% polled in 1967 election.
AIADMK front won the election, winning in 203 constituencies, with the AIADMK party itself winning 150 seats thus securing a simple majority to be able to form the government without the support of its coalition partners. DMDK won 29 seats more than the 23 seats won by DMK and chose to serve as an opposition party. Political analysts concluded that the election was a referendum on the outgoing DMK government and the powerful anti-incumbency sentiment helped the ADMK colaition. The results set the stage for the swearing-in of J. Jayalalitha for the third time as the Chief minister of Tamil Nadu.
Background
  Karunanidhi administration was noted for various developmental projects and generous spending of the tax money to implement various free schemes and issue freebies to the people. The government provided 1kg rice for 1 rupee, free health insurance for poor, free color television and gas stove for all. It also provided job for over 500,000 people in various departments of the government and introduced free concrete house scheme for the poor. It also implemented various road, bridge and drinking water projects in Chennai and all over Tamil Nadu. However, the election was dominated by three major issues, increase in price of essential commodities, 2G Spectrum scandal that implicated DMK minister A. Raja and M. Karunanidhi's daughter Kanimozhi and involvement of Karunanidhi's extended family in Tamil politics and business. Inflation was high during late 2010 to early 2011. The price of food and other essential commodities had increased exponentially affecting middle class and poor people. Onions were sold for Rs. 100, tomatoes for Rs. 80 and Jasmine flower for Rs. 1200 per kilo gram. This historical rise in price of essential food items was believed to be due to increased rainfall in North Indian states.12 The 2G spectrum scam in India involved the issue of 122 licenses of the 2G spectrum to 85 companies including many new telecom companies with little or no experience in the telecom sector at a price set in the year 2001. The scam is believed to have costed 67,719 crore  (US$15.03 billion) to the Indian exchequer. A. Raja, Union telecommunications minister from Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam was arrested by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in relation to the case. Kanimozhi, Rajya Sabha member from DMK and Chief minister's daughter and Sharad Kumar of Kalaignar TV were also included in the chargesheet filed by CBI. The five years of karunanidhi's rule also saw an undue influence of his extended family members in various aspcects of Tamil business and politics.3
Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam coalition
 Electoral alliances began to take shape in late 2010. J. Jayalalitha, the leader of All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) characterised the election as a turning point in Tamil Nadu history similar to 1967 election. She was alluding to the major political changes that took place in Tamil Nadu after 1967 election in which Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam defeated Indian National Congress for the first time and subsequently, Congress never won an election in the state.4
Manithaneya Makkal Katchi, political wing of Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam (TMMK) constituted a a five-member committee to hold consultations with Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK) for seat sharing. The party had decided to support ADMK in a resolution adopted at a high level meeting citing deteriorating law and order and corruption.5 Naan Tamizhar party president Seeman also expressed his support for ADMK on 10 January and said his decision is based on his opposition to INC which he claimed works against the interests of Sri Lankan Tamils.6 Cho Ramaswamy, founder of Thuglak magazine, was actively involved in the formation of alliances. He supported ADMK and encouraged other parties to do so as well. On the 41st anniversary of the founding of Thuglak on 14 January, he delivered an address that strongly opposed ruling DMK party. He encouraged Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) to forge an alliance with AIADMK.7 Communist Party of India Tamil Nadu state secretary D. Pandian also called for DMDK to join the ADMK coalition to defeat DMK8 and officially announced the continuation of CPI's coalition with ADMK on January 29.9 Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) announced its decision to contest the election with ADMK on 25 January. In a resolution adopted after party's Tamil Nadu state committee meeting held in Chennai attended by the general secretary Prakash Karat, the party said that the influence of Karunanidhi's family in politics, media and film industry has &quot;spread like octopus&quot; and defeating DMK is the only way to save the state.10
Despite the strained relationship between Indian National Congress (INC) and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK),11 ADMK leader Jayalalitha ruled out coalition with INC on 19 January.12 Tamil actor Karthik announced his party's (Ahila India Naadalum Makkal Katchi) support to ADMK after meeting Jayalalitha on 19 January.13 Hindu Munnani leader Rama Gopalan ruled out support to ADMK coalition on 20 January citing the particpation of anti-Hindu forces in the fold.14 DMDK officially announced their alliance with AIADMK and started their negotiations. This brought to an end the possibilities of 3rd Front and DMDK contesting the elections on their own.15
Vijay's Makkal Iyakkam supported AADMK Front. He delivered a speech in a rally attended by an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 people in Nagapattinam on February 22 condemning the actions of Sri Lankan military against Tamil Nadu fishermen.1617S. A. Chandrasekhar, noted film director and father of actor Vijay met with Jayalalitha three times during the run-up to the election and announced Makkal Iyakkam's decision to support the ADMK front in Trichy on March 27.1819
Seat allotment controversy
In the middle of March, amidst discussion to finalise the allocation of constituencies, ADMK surprised its allies by unilaterally deciding the 160 constituencies in which it will field candidates. The list included constituencies won by the CPI, CPM, Forward Bloc and Pudhiya Thamizhagam in the previous election. MDMK was not allotted any constituency.20 After the coalition partners threatened to form a third front under DMDK, ADMK gave in to their demands. Most of the seats ADMK took form its alliance partners were given back bringing the standoff to an end.21 However MDMK was not given the number of seats it asked for and hence Vaiko left ADMK led alliance and boycotted the elections.22
Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam coalition
 Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K. V. Thankabalu confirmed the continuation of his party's alliance with DMK on 21 January.23 DMK pulled out of the ruling coalition at the centre on 5 March amid disagreements with Congress over seat sharing.24 After three days, the parties struck a deal in which DMK gave in to the demand and allowed Congress to contest in 63 seats.25 Abdul Rahman, Member of Parliament from Vellore constituency announced the continuation of Indian Union Muslim League's coalition with DMK on 24 January 2011.26 After meeting Karunanidhi at his home on 16 January, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalavan said his party will work for the victory of DMK coalition.27 In a speech given during the wedding of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Minister Periyakaruppan's son in Chennai, Karunanidhi expressed his desire to step down from Chiefministership and continue as the leader of the party.28 Karunanidhi, during his trip to New Delhi for attending Chief Ministers meeting on 30 January, said that Indian National Congress, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal, Muslim League and Pattali Makkal Katchi are in the DMK coalition.29 But Ramadoss, the leader of PMK denied that and said no final decision has been taken on coalition.30 However PMK later joined the DMK alliance and was allotted 31 seats. It was later reduced to 30 to accommodate Congress which was firm on contesting 63 seats. Mylapore MLA and actor-turned politician S. V. Shekhar, joined Congress on February 6, 2011 after being expelled from AIADMK in 2009.31 Although Mylapore constituency was allotted to congress party, it did not give the chance to S.V. Shekhar. Instead the party allotted it to Jayanthi Thangabalu, the wife of TN Congress president K.V. Thangabalu. However her nomination was rejected by election commission citing incomplete submission of relevant documents. The nomination of K.V. Thangabalu, who was the replacement candidate was accepted making him the official congress candidate.32
Seat allotment controversy
Upset over the tough posture adopted by the Congress during the seat-sharing negotiations, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam on March 5 decided to pull out its Ministers from the Union government and provide only issue-based support. A resolution to this effect was adopted at a meeting of the high-level committee of the party at Anna Arivalayam, the party headquarters.33 But after days of intense bargaining, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Congress on March 9 struck a deal, under which the Congress would contest 63 seats.34
Other parties and associations
Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) boycotted the election following its withdrawal from the ADMK alliance as ADMK did not award the party any coalition constituency.35 Makkal Sakthi Katchi (Lok Satta Party), the party founded by Jayaprakash Narayan contested in 35 constituencies in 18 districts. Some of the candidates of the party were members/coordinators from the Non-Government Organisation 5th Pillar who were famous for issuing zero rupees notes to fight corruption. The party wass headed in Tamil Nadu by a steering committee comprising of 6 people including Vijay Anand of 5th Pillar.36 37
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) although a major force in North India had struggled to make a foothold in Tamil Nadu . BJP leader L.Ganesan declared on 13 January that BJP will go alone in the elections .38 BJP announced its Candidate list on March 18.39 Subramanian swamy leader of Janata Party announced JP will face the elections in alliance with BJP and will contest in 10 seats.40 JD(U) has announced it will contest 8 seats in alliance with BJP.41
Tamil film actor Karthik's Ahila India Naadalum Makkal Katchi entered the election as a member of ADMK coalition. When no seat was allocated to his party by ADMK, he decided to contest the election alone in 25 to 40 seats.42 His party with sizeable Thevar votes in southern Tamil Nadu is believed to eat into the AIADMK votebank. In 2006, former AIADMK minister Nainar Nagendran lost by 2,000 votes in Tirunelveli, where Karthik's party polled more than the margin.43 Two weeks later his split from ADMK, he announced his party will contest independently in 19 constituencies and support DMK in 213 constituencies.44
Educationist-turned-politician T. R. Pachamuthu's Indiya Jananayaka Katchi (IJK) leads the third front. It comprises Tamizhaga Munnetra Kazhagam of John Pandian, Samooka Samathuva Padai of retired IAS officer, P Sivakami, Tamil Nadu Vanigar Peravai and VOC Peravai. The front is fielding candidates in more than 150 constituencies . 45 Political observers feel that the IJK could poll 3,000 to 5,000 votes in many constituencies in Cuddalore, Villupuram, Perambalur, Ariyalur and Salem districts where Pachamuthu's Udayar community has sizeable presence. The Samooka Samathuva Padai will mobilize significant dalit votes in constituencies like Tindivanam, Krishnarayapuram, Haroor and Gangavalli. Sivakami herself is contesting from Gangavalli .46 John Pandian has some influence in Virudhunagar, Ramanathapuram, Thoothukudi, Dindigul and Tirunelveli districts.47

The party announced its candidate list on March 18.48 Puratchi Bharatham led by MLA JeganMurthy which was part of DMK alliance from 2004 left the alliance due to seat sharing issue.It will contest 40 seats on its own.49 Social Democratic Party of India has also plunged into the Tamil Nadu election fray with a view to garnering Muslim votes. They are concentrating on Coimbatore, Ramanathapuram and some parts of Chennai. Ahila Indiya Parampariya Meenavar Sangam decided to contest in 27 constituencies that constitute a major population of fishermen. The decision was made in a meeting of fishermen's unions from across Tamil Nadu held in Pattinapakkam headed by its general secreatary Rubeshkumar.50 Arundhathiar (a section of dalits) outfit headed by R Adhiyaman has fielded candidates in 20 segments in western Tamil Nadu .

Analysis and post-election reaction

While pre-polls and exit polls released before the counting showed a mixed picture and a close race, the early trends and final results pointed to a landslide victory for the AIADMK alliance and Jayalalithaa heading towards her third term as Chief Minister. M. Karunanidhi, after suffering a huge loss, submitted his resignation to Governor Surjit Singh Barnala, paving way for Jayalalithaa to swear in on May 15. While spiraling prices, power cut, and DMK's family politics were important factors, many analysts agree that it was the corruption charges (2G spectrum scandal), that eventually led them to their ultimate defeat. This election saw Congress' worst performance in Tamil Nadu, bagging only 5 seats out of 63 seats it contested. During the campaign, they were marred with in-fighting between state Congress leader K.V. Thangkabalu and other Congress members and their declining support in the state.113 114.In both tamil nadu and pondicherry congress was badly defeated. In Tamil nadu it was pushed to 6th position with 5 seats this is mainly due the support rendered by congress government in Ellam and it's attitude towards tamil people.DMK which supported congress because it is seen as Tamil centric party got the worst defeat because of its alliance with congress. After the election, Jayalalithaa thanked her supporters and said &quot;this is not a victory for me, but a victory for the state and the country&quot;. She further stated that she wants to &quot;rebuild the state, from the havoc created by the previous government&quot; and insisted that she does not plan to share power with her allies.115 DMDK leader, Vijaykanth, after being the second largest party in the new assembly and an important ally of AIADMK, stated that this is a &quot;victory for the people and an end to family rule&quot;.116 TDP leader and former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Chandrababu Naidu, called and congratulated Jayalalithaa on her &quot;victory over corruption&quot;.117 After the loss, Congress leader Jayanthi Natarajan, conceded defeat and wished the best for incoming CM, Jayalalithaa. While she admitted that 2G spectrum scam played a huge role in their defeat, she further re-iterated that they have done everything they can to be transparent and that action has been taken against individuals responsible for the corruption. Union Minister, P. Chidambaram admitted that this was a huge loss for Congress in Tamil Nadu but does not believe this will affect the UPA government at the center, due to the fact that this was a loss of an alliance led by DMK and not INC.
