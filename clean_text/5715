Country Universe accessdate=August 8, 2011 Bobby Peacock stated that I wouldn't mind if the banjo from the 2007 version were left in, but its omission is  hardly make-or-break. Perhaps my biggest problem is that the song's chorus undermines itself in the second half  it starts out emphatic  and anthemic as usual, but there's just no oomph on the hook. It almost feels as if she's trailing off mid-sentence.cite web url=http://www.roughstock.com/blog/taylor-swift-sparks-fly-single-review title=Taylor Swift  Sparks Fly publisher=Bobby Peacock. Roughstock date=Last Updated: August 8, 2011 accessdate=August 8, 2011 Blake Boldt of Engine 145 stated Sparks Fly centers around a simple but effective hookI see sparks fly whenever you smilethat further cements Swifts reputation as one the craftiest songwriters in popular music.cite web url=http://www.engine145.com/single-review-taylor-swift-sparks-fly/ title=Single Review: Taylor Swift  Sparks Fly date=July 18, 2011 publisher=Blake Boldt. Engine145 accessdate=August 15, 2011 Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country commented on the chorus of the song stating, Though Swift implies that this particular crush is a bad idea, she still insists that they should try to make it work in the chorus: Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain / Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain / Cause I see sparks fly / Whenever you smile, she sings insistently.

According to Swift, the song is about falling for someone who you maybe shouldn't fall for, but you can't stop yourself because there's such a connection and chemistry.

 Critical reception 
Sparks Fly generally received positive reviews from Music journalism music critics. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised Swift's vocals on Sparks Fly, commenting that her voice in such an upbeat song is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer.cite web url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/speak-now-20101026 title=Taylor Swift Speak Now Big Machine work=Rolling Stone date=October 26, 2010 publisher=Wenner Media accessdate=October 26, 2010 Rahul Prabhakar of The Oxonian Review considers it dopamine-infused, hair-whipping stuff.cite web url=http://www.oxonianreview.org/wp/taylor-swift-needs-a-gap-year/  title=Taylor Swift Needs a Gap Year  work=Rahul Prabhakar  date=November 1, 2010 publisher=The Oxonian Review accessdate=August 8, 2011 Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine calls the song the purest iteration of Swifts template and repertoire, also saying that it could turn things around for Swift, as its perhaps the most perfectly constructed single in a career built on tracks that are marvels of pop production and songwriting. He concluded by stating that the song proves how evocative those turns-of-phrase can be in the right context. To that end, Sparks Fly plays as a template as much as it does as a standalone single, and its a testament to everything Taylor Swift gets right. Bobby Peacock of Roughstock claims that he gets a sense that Taylor is starting to experience a little  burnout at radio. Her songs drop like rocks once they peak, and she's currently 0 for 3 on hitting the top of the Billboard charts. While I don't think this song has that je ne sais quoi to get her another 'You Belong with Me'-level  hit, I still think that even a slightly lesser effort from her is a worthwhile listen. Blake Boldt of Engine 145 praised Swift, saying Her infusion of individual lines with urgency Drop everything now, she insists and earnestness Take away the pain, she pleads are a tribute to her talent, not so much as a distinguished vocalist but as an excellent communicator. Each frazzled note is freighted with meaning. Should I stay or should I go now?, she wonders, sic wiling away the hours before he calls her again. Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country claimed the song is just another one of those so-Swift tracks that continually toes the line between country and pop to create a genre that is 100% Taylor Swift. Erin Thompson of Seattle Weekly stated he wasn't to hot on the song and compared the song to Swift's earlier works, Fearless Taylor Swift song Fearless, Hey Stephen, and Forever and Always, and stated that Swift puts in a line about standing in the rain in so many of her songs that I'm beginning to think she watches The Notebook film The Notebook every time she gets ready to sit down and write a song.cite web url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/reverb/2011/11/taylor_swifts_speak_now_track.php title=Taylor Swift's Speak Now Track If This Was A Movie Is Better Than Her Upcoming New Single work=Erin Thompson date=November 25, 2011 publisher=Seattle Weekly accessdate=December 12, 2011 Mikael Wood of Spin magazine Spin considered it a bubbly tune along with Swift's song, Long Live.cite web url=http://books.google.co.kr/books?id=J7EuavrzL9kC&pg=PA80&dq=Taylor+Swift+Sparks+Fly&hl=ko&sa=X&ei=K1zJT5DbJpLh0wHdosyIAQ&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Taylor%20Swift%20Sparks%20Fly&f=false  title=Spin magazine Spin  publisher=Spin Media LLC accessdate=June 2, 2012
