 
Lyo and Merly are the official mascots of the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics held in Singapore. The duo is a red male lion and a blue female Merlion respectively, and was officially introduced by Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan on 21 November 2009 at Suntec City in Singapore.1 A naming contest was originally held to name the two mascots, which was won by two Singaporeans. It took designers from Cubix International about six months to complete designing the mascots.2
Background

Since the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France, the Olympic Games have always had a mascot(s), typically an animal native to the area where the Games take place, or occasionally human figures representing local cultural heritage. The first major mascot in the Olympic Games was Misha in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Misha was used extensively during the opening and closing ceremonies, had a TV animated cartoon and appeared on several merchandise products. Indeed, most Olympic merchandise of the current day focus on the mascots, rather than the Olympic flag or other emblems. Subsequent mascots were widely publicised and featured in the Games. Although the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics is the first Games of the type, being a departure from the senior Olympics, the tradition of carrying a mascot(s) has remained.
Development
In early 2009, seven shortlisted mascot design proposals were submitted to the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee (SYOGOC). Amongst the seven, the proposal of Cubix Internatinal, a company specialising in branding, animation and character development, was eventually selected. Cubix initially sought to develop robot mascots, intending to showcase Singapore as a &quot;technologically advanced country&quot;. Research on Olympic mascots however prompted them to move away from the robot theme, and focus on animal mascots. The company stated it wanted to developed a pair of mascots &quot;who had contrasting yet complementary personalities.&quot; The company's Mascots and Puppets Specialists team transformed the mascots from design to actual models.3
There were issues over the materials used to build the mascots. Eventually, foam was selected as the main material for the mascot suits. The mascots suits were noted to be heavy, with Lyo's head weighing at  and Merly's head weighing . The heads would be strapped onto a harness donned by the mascot wearer. An inbult fan in the suit and optional vests lined with cool packs are also noted to keep the mascot wearer from gaining excessive heat.4

Merlion; water








Lyo's name is the initials (L.Y.O.) of &quot;Lion of the Youth Olympics&quot;,17 while Merly's name stems from the combination of &quot;mer&quot;, which means the sea, and &quot;l&quot; and &quot;y&quot; which stands for liveliness and youthfulness. The two characters are an allusion to the &quot;Lion City&quot; label of Singapore, and the Merlion, a national symbol of Singapore, respectively. Additionally, Dr. Balakrishnan commented that the duo were &quot;an interesting play on fire and water&quot;. He added that &quot;there are aspects of which (the mascots) we clearly can identify with as Singaporeans, but really what we hope is these mascots will be embraced by Singaporeans as well as the visitors who come.&quot;18
The mane of Lyo is stated to resemble the Flame of Passion of the Spirit of Youth, the emblem of the Games. It is also a reference to the Singapore 2010 bid tagline &quot;Blazing the Trail&quot;. The paw of the mascot is also said to be shaped like the island of Singapore.19 Merly is said to be vegetarian due to &quot;a deep respect for all living creatures&quot;, and her is said to be shaped like a heart - representations of the character attributes given by the mascot creators.20
Outreach
The two mascots appear in various activities and programmes, including those to schools and roadshows and launches. The Olympic theme was featured in Singapore's National Day Parade, due to the two events' proximity (both being held in August), and Lyo and Merly were seen participating in pre-parade activities.21
Lyo and Merly were also widely featured in memorabilia of the Games. Imagery of the mascots are sold at the official Olympic store at Takashimaya shopping centre in Orchard Road, the shopping district of the country.22 Also, four postal stamps launched by SYOGOC and Singapore Post were specially released depicting the mascots. The stamps saw Lyo and Merly in poses featuring the Games' Culture and Education Programme (CEP) and Olympic sports. Additionally, a limited edition Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games Commemorative Pack, which depicted the journey since the country won the bid to host the Games, featured an exclusive MyStamp Sheet of the mascots in all 26 sport poses.23 Lyo and Merly were also imprinted amongst the three coins released by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to commemorate the Games.24 A mural of the duo was also made by artist Charlene Tenio, which was showcased at the countdown party at the official hotel partner, Fairmont Singapore.25
