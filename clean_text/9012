Felix Anthony &quot;Doc&quot; Blanchard (December 11, 1924 &lt;U+2013&gt; April 19, 2009) is best known as the college football player who became the first ever junior to win the Heisman Trophy. He also won the Maxwell Award and was the first ever football player to win the James E. Sullivan Award. He played football for the United States Military Academy at West Point Army Black Knights football team. Because his father was a doctor, Felix Blanchard was nicknamed &quot;Little Doc&quot; as a boy.1 After football, he served in the United States Air Force from 1947 until 1971 when he retired with the rank of Colonel.
Early years
Blanchard was born on December 11, 1924 in Bishopville, South Carolina. His father was a doctor and had played college football at Tulane University and Wake Forest University.2 Blanchard, nicknamed &quot;Little Doc&quot; due to his father's occupation, attended high school at Saint Stanislaus College in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. He led the school's football team, the Rockachaws, to an undefeated season during his senior year in 1941. Blanchard was recruited to play college football by Army, Fordham University and the University of Notre Dame, among others.3 Blanchard said in 1985 that he had been contacted about going to West Point when he was in high school.4 He said, &quot;At that point in time, I really wasn&lt;U+2019&gt;t interested. Academically, I never was too hot, so I never had any idea I would pass the entrance examination and go to West Point.&quot;5
Instead, Blanchard chose to play for the University of North Carolina Tar Heels, partly because the team was coached by his mother's cousin, Jim Tatum.6 While at North Carolina, he played on the freshman team because in 1942, NCAA rules still prevented freshmen from playing for the varsity.7
After completing his freshman season at North Carolina in 19428, he tried to enlist in the United States Navy's V-12 program, which allowed students to complete their education in return for a service commitment.9 He was rejected because he was considered overweight and had poor vision.10 He then enlisted in the United States Army until securing an appointment to West Point.11 He was stationed in New Mexico with a chemical-warfare unit until his father secured him an appointment to West Point, and he enrolled in July 1944.1213
West Point years
During his three years of playing football at West Point (he sat out the 1943 season14), his team under coach Earl &quot;Red&quot; Blaik compiled an undefeated 27&lt;U+2013&gt;0&lt;U+2013&gt;1 record - the tie being a famous 0&lt;U+2013&gt;0 game15 against Notre Dame.16 In 1944, after a famous season-ending win over Navy, General Douglas MacArthur even took time out from his war duties to send this telegram:17

Notre Dame coach Ed McKeever was amazed by Blanchard. After his 1944 team lost to Army by a score of 59&lt;U+2013&gt;0, McKeever said, &quot;I've just seen Superman in the flesh. He wears number 35 and goes by the name of Blanchard.&quot;18
An all-around athlete, Blanchard served as the placekicker and punter in addition to his primary roles as an offensive fullback and a linebacker on defense. In the first capacity, he teamed with soon to be fellow Heisman winner Glenn Davis (Davis won the Heisman the following year, 1946) to form one of the most lethal rushing combinations in football history. Blanchard, in his three seasons at West Point, scored 38 touchdowns, gained 1,908 yards and earned the nickname &quot;Mr. Inside.&quot; Teammate Davis earned the nickname &quot;Mr. Outside&quot;19 and in November 1945, they both shared the cover of Time magazine.20
In 1945, he became the first college junior to ever win the Heisman Trophy and the first ever football player to win the James E. Sullivan Award.21 In 1984 at the awards ceremony marking the 50th Heisman Trophy presentation, Blanchard took the occasion to recall, in comparison to the big glitzy shows for the ceremony today, how he learned of his Heisman selection in 1945. He said, &quot;I got a telegram. It said, 'You&lt;U+2019&gt;ve been selected to win the Heisman Trophy. Please wire collect.'&quot;22
In 1946, Blanchard missed the first two games of the season due to an injury to his knee.23
In 1947, Blanchard played himself in the movie The Spirit of West Point. His West Point team-mate Glenn Davis also played himself in the film. Other cast members include Robert Shayne as Coach Colonel Earl &quot;Red&quot; Blaik, Anne Nagel as Mrs. Blaik, George O'Hanlon as Joe Wilson, Michael Browne as Roger &quot;Mileaway&quot; McCarty, Tanis Chandler as Mildred, Mary Newton as Mrs. Mary Blanchard and William Forrest as Doc Blanchard's father, Dr. Felix Blanchard. Also appearing as themselves are 1940 Heisman Trophy winner Tom Harmon and sportscasters Bill Stern and Harry Wismer. The screenplay was written by Tom Reed based on a story by Mary Howard. Ralph Murphy directed.242526
In addition to football, Blanchard was also a member of the Army track and field team. In a track meet in 1945, weighing in at 210 pounds and standing 6 feet 2 inches tall, he ran the 100 yard dash in 10 seconds. He also won championships in the shot put.27
In 1947, Blanchard graduated from West Point and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force.28 He coached Army&lt;U+2019&gt;s freshman team in the 1950s, but he never played professional football, choosing a military career instead.29

Military career
Blanchard had the opportunity to play professional football after being selected third overall in the 1946 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers.30 Shortly after graduating from West Point in 1947, he and teammates Glenn Davis and Barney Poole sought four-month furloughs from military service in order to play in the NFL. Some Congressmen said the players were seeking special privileges, and the War Department turned down the request.31
Blanchard then chose to embark upon a career in the United States Air Force and became a fighter pilot. In 1959, while flying back to his base near London, an oil line in his plane broke and a fire broke out. He could have parachuted to safety, but the plane might have crashed into a village. He instead stayed with the plane and made a perfect landing. The event garnered him an Air Force commendation for bravery.32
In the Vietnam War, Blanchard flew 84 missions over North Vietnam. He piloted a fighter-bomber during a one-year tour of duty that ended in January 1969.33 He retired from the Air Force in 1971 as a colonel.3435
Death
Blanchard died of pneumonia on April 19, 2009 in Bulverde, Texas. He had been living with his daughter Mary and her husband for the last 20 years of his life.36 In addition to his daughter Mary, Blanchard is survived by his daughter Jo Mills, his son Felix Blanchard III, a sister, Mary Elizabeth Blanchard and seven grandchildren.37 His wife, Jody, died in 1994.38 At the time of his death, he was the oldest living Heisman Trophy winner.39
Honors and memorials
Blanchard was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1959.40
At a 1991 ceremony, he presented his Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award and James E. Sullivan Award to his&lt;U+2014&gt;and his father's41&lt;U+2014&gt;former high school alma mater, Saint Stanislaus College prep school, in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.42 He also presented his red and black Saint Stanislaus number 61 jersey to the school.43. The trophy, awards and jersey were enshrined in the Brother Alexis Memorial Resource Center on the Saint Stanislaus campus until Hurricane Katrina washed them away in 2005. The items have since been recovered.4445
In Blanchard's honor, the Interstate 20 / U.S. Route 15 interchange near his hometown of Bishopville, South Carolina has been named the Felix &quot;Doc&quot; Blanchard Interchange.46 A three-statue bronze commemoration of Blanchard as a young boy, as a football hero and as an Air Force fighter pilot, will be unveiled in December 2009. It will stand in a park setting near the Bishopville&lt;U+2019&gt;s Woodward Public Library on Main Street.47
West Point announced in April 2009, before Blanchard's death, that it would retire the number 35 worn by Blanchard at a ceremony in the Fall of 2009.48
