With Lakeland, he batted .241 with 114 hits, 17 doubles, six triples, and 10 home runs in 133 games played. In the field, Meyer only played second base. It would later prove to be his last professional season playing at that position.

In 129 games with the Triplets, he batted .302 with 75 runs scored, 146 hits, 26 doubles, seven triples, nine home runs, 57 RBIs, and 10 stolen bases. Meyer was a September call-up for the Detroit Tigers that year. On September 14, 1974, he made his MLB debut with the Tigers in a game against the New York Yankees, where in one at bat he went hitless.6 He received his first hit on September 20, in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers.7 Meyer also hit two home runs in that game, the first coming in the third inning off of Brewers' starter Bill Champion, and the second coming Brewers' reliever Bill Travers in the seventh inning.89 In 13 games with Detroit that year, Meyer batted .200 with five runs scored, 10 hits, one double, one triple, three home runs, seven RBIs, and one stolen base. All of his 12 defensive games were played in left field.
In 1975, Meyer played his first full season at the major league level. He played left field and first base in the field. During the fifth inning of a game against the Boston Red Sox on April 25, Meyer hit a home run to break up Luis Tiant's perfect game bid.10 One day after hitting the game-winning home run for the Tigers against the Milwaukee Brewers on May 7, Meyer committed a throwing error that let the deciding Texas Rangers' run score.11 He batted .236 with 56 runs scored, 111 hits, 17 doubles, three triples, eight home runs, 47 RBIs, and eight stolen bases in 122 games played during the 1975 season. Meyer led the American League that year in at bats per strikeouts with 18.8, which was over four points more than Mickey Rivers, who was second in the league in that statistic.12
Meyer played 105 games in 1976 for the Tigers. On the year, he batted .252 with 37 runs scored, 74 hits, eight doubles, four triples, two home runs, 16 RBIs, and 10 stolen bases. His batting average was the highest it would ever be as a Tigers player, despite the decline in at-bats (470 in 1975, 294 in 1976). During the season, Meyer played 47 games in left field, 19 at first base, and one in the designated hitter spot.

He led the American League with 159 defensive games at first base.16 During the Mariners inaugural season, he led the team in hits and RBIs.17 Meyer also set multiple career highs in 1977 that would stand until the end of his professional tenure in games played, plate appearances (639), at bats (582), runs scored, hits, home runs, RBIs, walks (43), strikeouts (51), on-base percentage (.320), and total bases (257).

Defensively, he played 121 games at first base and two games in left field. Meyer was moved back to third base during the 1979 season, while also playing limited time at left field and first base. In June, while Meyer was having success at the plate, he attributed it to switching positions.18 On the season, Meyer batted .278 with 72 runs scored, 146 hits, 21 doubles, seven triples, 20 home runs, 74 RBIs, and 11 stolen bases in 144 games played.
During the 1980 season, Meyer batted .275 with 56 runs scored, 146 hits, 25 doubles, six triples, 11 home runs, 71 RBIs, and eight stolen bases in 146 games played for Seattle.

Meyer saw his playing time decrease that season due to strained abdominal muscles, which had him on the disabled list from the start of the season to April 15.19
Oakland Athletics and later career
In December 1981, the Seattle Mariners traded Meyer to the Oakland Athletics in exchange for Rich Bordi.20 In his first season with the Athletics, Meyer batted .240 with 28 runs scored, 92 hits, 17 doubles, three triples, eight home runs, and 59 RBIs in 120 games played.
