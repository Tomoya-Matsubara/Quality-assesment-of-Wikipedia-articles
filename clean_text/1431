The law school of Beirut (also known as the law school of Berytus and the school of Roman law at Berytus) was a center for the study of Roman law in classical antiquity located in Beirut. It flourished under the patronage of the Roman emperors and functioned as the Roman Empire's preeminent center of jurisprudence until its destruction in 551 CE.
The law schools of the Roman Empire established organized repositories of imperial constitutions and institutionalized the study and practice of jurisprudence to relieve the busy imperial courts. The archiving of imperial constitutions facilitated the task of jurists in referring to legal precedents. The origins of the law school of Beirut are obscure. The earliest written mention of the school dates to 239 CE, when its reputation had already been established. The school attracted young, affluent Roman citizens, and its professors made major contributions to the Codex of Justinian. The school achieved such wide recognition throughout the Empire that Beirut was known as the &quot;Mother of Laws&quot;. Beirut was one of the few schools allowed to continue teaching jurisprudence when Byzantine emperor Justinian I shut down other provincial law schools.
The course of study at Beirut lasted for five years and consisted in the revision and analysis of classical juridic texts and imperial constitutions, in addition to case discussions. Justinian took a personal interest in the teaching process, charging the bishop of Beirut, the governor of Phoenicia Maritima and the teachers with discipline maintenance in the school.
The school's facilities were destroyed in the aftermath of a massive earthquake that hit the Phoenician coastline. It was moved to Sidon but did not survive the Arab conquest of 635 CE. Ancient texts attest that the school was located next to the ancient Anastasis church, vestiges of which lie beneath the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Beirut's historic center.
Background
As the guarantor of justice, the Roman emperor was expected to devote substantial amounts of time to judicial matters. He was the chief magistrate whose major prerogative (jus) was the ordering of all public affairs, for which he could demand assistance from anyone at any time.1
With legal appeals, petitions from subjects and judicial queries of magistrates and governors, the emperors were careful to consult with the jurists (iuris consulti), who were usually secretaries drafted from the equestrian order. From the reign of Augustus (27 BCE&lt;U+2013&gt;14 CE), jurists began compiling organized repositories of imperial edicts (constitutiones), and juristic scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. Every new judicial decision was founded on archived legal precedents and earlier deliberations. The edict repositories and the imperially sponsored juristic scholarship gave rise to the earliest law school system of the Western world, aimed specifically at training professional jurists.2
History
During the reign of Augustus, Beirut was established under the name Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus34 (and granted the status of Ius Italicum) as a colony for Battle of Actium veterans from the fifth Macedonian and the third Gallic legions. It was chosen as a regional center instead of the more prominent Phoenician cities of Tyre and Sidon, which had a history of belligerence against Rome.56
 Beirut was first mentioned in writing as a major center for the study of law in the 239 CE works of Gregory Thaumaturgus, the bishop of Neo-Caesarea.789 Other early written sources do not mention when the law school was established, and the date is much debated among modern historians and scholars. Edward Gibbon suggested its founding may have been directed by locally born Emperor Alexander Severus, who reigned during 222&lt;U+2013&gt;235 CE;10 this hypothesis had been supported by Gilles M&lt;U+00E9&gt;nage, a late seventeenth-century French scholar. Italian jurist Scipione Gentili, however, attributed the school's foundation to Augustus, while nineteenth-century German theologian Karl Hase advocated its establishment shortly after the victory at Actium (31 BCE).11 Adolf Friedrich Rudorff dated it to the reign of Hadrian,12 while Franz Peter Bremer suggested that it opened around 200 CE, based on Thaumaturgus.13
Theodor Mommsen linked the establishment of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces. After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into Greek, published and archived. This function was first recorded in 196 CE, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the Gregorian Codex, but the city is thought to have served as a repository since earlier times.1415 The proximity of the repository to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult archived documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees&lt;U+2014&gt;an advantage that the law schools of Caesarea Maritima and Alexandria lacked.16
The third-century emperors Diocletian and Maximian issued constitutions exempting the students of the law school of Beirut from compulsory service in their hometowns.1718 In the fourth century, the Greek rhetorician Libanius reported that the school attracted young students from affluent families and deplored the school's instructional use of Latin, which was gradually abandoned in favor of Greek in the course of the century.192021 By the fifth century, Beirut had established its leading position and repute among the Empire's law schools; its teachers were highly regarded and played a chief role in the development of juristic learning in the East to the point that they were dubbed &quot;Oecumenical Masters&quot;.2223 From 425 CE, the law school of Constantinople became a rival center of law study and was the only school, along with Beirut's, to be maintained after Justinian I closed those of Alexandria, Caesarea Maritima and Athens in 529 CE24 because their teachings contradicted with Christian faith.25
On July 9, 551, the Phoenician coastal cities were devastated by a high magnitude earthquake. In Beirut the earthquake was followed by a tsunami and a fire that obliterated the city. In the aftermath, 30,000 people lost their lives, including many students from abroad. Justinian allocated funds to rebuild Beirut, and the law school was temporarily moved to the southern Phoenician city of Sidon, pending reconstruction; the best teachers, however, moved to Constantinople. Misfortune hit Beirut again in 560 CE when a massive fire ravaged the recovering city. The law school was not reopened, and all prospect for its return was abandoned with the Arab conquest in 635 CE.2627
Academia
The study course at the law school of Beirut was restricted to Roman law; it did not cover the local laws of the province of Phoenicia.28 Ancient texts provide an idea of the curriculum, the teaching method, the course languages and its duration.
Preparatory studies
Potential students were expected to have undergone grammar, rhetoric and encyclopedic sciences studies. Another prerequisite was the mastery of Greek and Latin, given that the classical juridic references and imperial constitutions used in the teaching program were written in Latin. The aspirants could pursue their preparatory studies in public schools or have private tutors.29
Curriculum
 Little is known about the Beirut law school's curriculum before the fifth century. The Scholia Sinaitica and the Scholia to the Basilica provide glimpses of the school's teaching method, comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze juridic texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as Ulpian. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.303132
Jurisprudence was taught in Latin, even in the law schools of the East, but toward the end of the fourth and the beginning of the fifth century, Latin was supplanted by Greek at Beirut,3334 which was the long-established lingua franca of the eastern territories of the Roman Empire.35 A similar shift probably occurred at the school of Constantinople at about the same time.3637
The Omnem constitution at the beginning of the Digest is the only source of information about the existing study system in the fifth century until the Justinian reforms of 533 CE. The old program was a four-year course to be completed before the age of 25. The courses were based on the works of Gaius, Ulpian, Papinian and Paulus. Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth year in private study of Paulus' Responsa; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special nicknames: first year, Dupondii; second, Edictales; third, Papinianistae; fourth, Lytae.3839
Justinian's Omnem constitution fixed the duration of the legal course in the schools of Beirut and Constantinople at five years.4041 The courses consisted of lectures and self-study using materials advanced in his Corpus Juris Civilis, namely the Institutiones (Institutes), Digesta (Digest) and Codex (Code).4243 First-year students were lectured on the Institutes and on the first part of the Digest;44 second-year students were taught the greater part of the Digest,45 and third-year students had to learn various texts from Papinian and the leges singulares.46 There were no lectures during the course's fourth year but the pupils studied the remainder of the Digest.47 Nicknames were still given according to the year of study, but Justinian changed the name of first-year students from the frivolous Dupondii (which means &quot;two pennies&quot;) to Iustiniani novi and dubbed fifth-year students Prolytae.4849 At the end of the course, graduands were given certificates allowing them to work as court advocates or in the imperial civil service.50
Professorial body
Ancient texts reveal the names and deeds of some of the most notable law professors at the Beirut school. The scarce sources include historical accounts, juridic works, anthologies, ancient correspondences and funerary inscriptions.
Antioch-based rhetoric teacher Libanius wrote many letters of correspondence to Domninus the Elder, a fourth-century law school professor. In 360 CE, Libanius invited Domninus to leave Beirut and teach with him at the rhetoric school of Antioch. Domninus apparently declined the offer, since later correspondence to him from Libanius, between 361 and 364 CE, served as recommendations for law school candidates.51
The most brilliant era of Beirut's law school, spanning the century between 400 and 500 CE, was known as the era of the &quot;Ecumenical Masters&quot; (Greek: &lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+1FC6&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt; &lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+1F30&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C5&gt;&lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03AD&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt; &lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03AC&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03BB&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;). During this period, a succession of seven highly esteemed law masters was largely responsible for the revival of legal education in the Eastern Roman Empire.5253 The seven revered masters, cited with praise by sixth-century scholars, were Cyrillus, Patricius, Domninus, Demosthenes, Eudoxius, Leontius and Amblichus.54
Cyrillus was the founder of the ecumenical school of jurists.55 He is believed to have taught as of  or  CE. Styled &quot;the great&quot; due to his reputation as a teacher, he was known for his direct use of ancient sources of law and for interpreting jurists such as Ulpian and Papinian. Cyrillus wrote a precise treatise on definitions that supplied the materials for many important scholia appended to the first and second titles of the eleventh book of the Basilica.5657 Patricius was praised in the third preface of the Justinian Digest (Tanta-Dedoken) as a distinguished professor of the Beirut law school. Archaeological excavations done in Beirut at the turn of the twentieth century revealed a funerary monument believed to have belonged to Patricius.5859 The son of Eudoxius, Leontius was described by ecclesiastical historian Zacharias Rhetor, who was his first-year student in 487 or 488 CE, to have a great reputation in the legal field. He was raised to the office of Praetorian prefect of the East under Emperor Anastasius I between 503 and 504 CE, and became Magister militum in 528 CE. Leontius was also involved as a commissioner in the preparation of the first codex of Justinian.6061 His contemporary, Amblichus, wrote a commentary on Ulpian's Libri ad Edictum.62
Historical sources also tell of Euxenius, a teacher at the Beirut law school who taught during the times of the &quot;Ecumenical Masters&quot;. Euxenius was the brother of the city's bishop Eustathius and was involved in the 460 CE religious controversy caused by Timothy Aelurus, which opposed the Miaphysites to the followers of the Council of Chalcedon.63 Dorotheus, Anatolius (son of Leontius) and Julianus were school professors contemporary to Justinian I. The first two were summoned to the imperial court and commissioned to draft the Digesta. Under the supervision of Tribonian, Dorotheus also collaborated with Theophilus, a Constantinopolitan law teacher, in drafting the Institutiones.6465 Julianus, the last known professor of Beirut's law school, was extolled by Theaetetus as &quot;the light of the law&quot;.66 After the earthquake, Julianus left Beirut and settled in Constantinople, where he authored the Epitome Iuliani in 555 CE.67
Under Justinian, there were eight teachers in the law schools of the Byzantine Empire, presumably four in each of Beirut and Constantinople's schools.6869 Justinian mandated the supervision and enforcement of discipline in the school of Beirut to the teachers, the city's bishop and the governor of Phoenicia Maritima.7071
Notable students
While most of the law school's students are not remembered by history, ancient historians and sources recount the stories of some of those who were deemed notable and achieved fame.
According to Eusebius of Caesarea, Pamphilus of Caesarea was born into a rich family in Beirut in the latter half of the third century and attended its law school. Pamphilus later became the presbyter of Caesarea Maritima and the founder of its extensive Christian library. He is celebrated as a martyr by both the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Eusebius also tells of martyred brothers Aphian and Aedesius, born to a noble Lycian family. They converted to Christianity while studying law in Beirut and were persecuted and executed for their beliefs.72
Fourth-century historian Eunapius wrote of Anatolius, a high-ranking Roman official known to his enemies as Azutrio. Anatolius occupied the offices of consul of Syria, vicarius of the Diocese of Asia, proconsul of Constantinople, urban prefect of Constantinople in 354 CE, and Praetorian prefect of Illyricum until his death in 360 CE. In his account of Anatolius, Eunapius summarized: &quot;He reached the summit of the science of law. Nothing about this is surprising because Beirut, his homeland, is the mother and nurse of these studies&quot;.7374 Libanius' correspondence with Gaianus of Tyre discusses the latter's achievements after his graduation from the law school of Beirut; Gaianus became the consular governor of Phoenicia in 362 CE.75 Gazan lawyer and church historian Sozomen, also a law student at Beirut, wrote in his Historia Ecclesiastica about Triphyllius, a convert to Christendom who became the bishop of Nicosia. Triphyllius received juridic training in Beirut and was criticized by his teacher Saint Spyridon for his atticism and for using legal vocabulary instead of that of the Bible.32&quot;/&gt;
Zacharias Rhetor studied law at Beirut between 487 and 492 CE, then worked as a lawyer in Constantinople until his imperial contacts won him the appointment as bishop of Mytilene. Among Rhetor's works is the biography of Severus, the last monophysite patriarch of Antioch and one of the founders of the Syriac Orthodox Church, who had also been a law student in Beirut as of 486 CE.7677 Another late fifth-century student was John Rufus, an anti-Chalcedonian priest who moved to Maiuma after the expulsion of his master, Peter the Fuller. In Maiuma, John Rufus authored the Plerophoriae and the Life of Peter the Iberian.7879
Location
Historically, Roman stationes or auditoria, where teaching was done, stood next to public libraries housed in temples. This arrangement was copied in the Roman colony at Beirut. The first mention of the school's premises dates to 350 CE,80 but the description does not specify its location. In the fifth century, Zacharias Rhetor reported that the school stood next to the &quot;Temple of God&quot;, the description of which permitted its identification with the Byzantine Anastasis cathedral.81
At the turn of the twentieth century, archaeological excavations in the souq between the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral and Saint George Cathedral of the Maronites unearthed a funerary stele etched with an epitaph to a man named Patricius, &quot;whose career was consecrated for the study of law&quot;.82 The epitaph was identified as being dedicated to the famous fifth-century law school professor.83 In 1994, archaeological diggings underneath the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Beirut Central District's Nejmeh Square identified structural elements of the Anastasis cathedral, but they were restricted to an area of  and failed to unearth the interred school.848586
Reputation and legacy
 The law school of Beirut supplied the Roman Empire, especially its eastern provinces, with lawyers and magistrates for three centuries until the school's destruction. The influx of students was abundant and persistent because of the affluence, honor and secured employment offered by the profession.87 A degree in law became highly sought following an edict issued in 460 CE by Emperor Leo I. The edict ordered that candidates for the bar of the Eastern praetorian prefecture had to produce certificates of proficiency from the law teachers who instructed them at one of the recognized law schools of the Empire.8889
The in-depth studies of the juridic classical works in Beirut, and later in Constantinople, conferred an unprecedented scientific dimension to jurisprudence; this academic movement gave rise to the minds behind Justinian's juridic reforms. As a result of the new understanding of the classical juridic texts, the imperial laws of the late fifth and early sixth centuries were clearer and more coherent than those of the early Postclassical Era, according to legal historian George Mousourakis and other scholars.90919293
The school garnered accolades throughout its existence and was bestowed with the title Berytus Nutrix Legum (Beirut, Mother of Laws) by Eunapius, Libanius, Zacharias Rhetor and finally by Emperor Justinian.94 His 533 CE Omnem constitution read:

These three works which we have composed we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities as well as in the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.95

From the third century on, the school tolerated Christian teachings, producing a number of students who would become influential church leaders and bishops, such as Pamphilus of Caesarea, Severus of Antioch and Aphian. Under Cyrillus, the first of the Ecumenical Masters, the Christian faith was consolidated as an integral element of the juristic training.9697
Two professors from the law school of Beirut, Dorotheus and Anatolius, had such a repute for their wisdom and knowledge that they were especially praised by Justinian in the opening of his Tanta constitution. The emperor summoned both professors to assist his minister Tribonian in compiling the Codex of Justinian,98 the Empire's body of civil laws issued between 529 and 534 CE. The Tanta passage reads:

... Dorotheus, an illustrious man, of great eloquence and qu&lt;U+00E6&gt;storian rank, whom, when he was engaged in delivering the law to students in the most brilliant city of Berytus,we, moved by his great reputation and renown, summoned to our presence and made to share in the work in question; again, Anatolius, an illustrious person, a magistrate, who, like the last, was invited to this work when acting as an exponent of law at Berytus, a man who came of an ancient stock, as both his father Leontius and his grandfather Eudoxius left behind them an excellent report in respect of legal learning...99

For centuries following its compilation, the work of Justinian's commission was studied and incorporated into the legal systems of different nations and has profoundly impacted the Byzantine law and the Western legal tradition.100 Peter Stein asserts that the texts of ancient Roman law have constituted &quot;a kind of legal supermarket, in which lawyers of different periods have found what they needed at the time.&quot;101
 The Corpus Juris Civilis remained the basis of Byzantine law until the publication of the Ecloga legum in 741 CE by Emperor Leo III and his son and co-regent Constantine V. The Ecloga was a shortened and more philanthropic version of the Codex of Justinian, whose dispositions were more in tune with Christian values. It was written in Greek, since Latin had fallen into disuse, and its provisions continued to be applied in later centuries in the neighboring Balkan and Asia Minor regions, with surviving translations in Slavic, Armenian and Arabic.102103104 Emperor Basil I, who ruled in the ninth century, issued the Prochiron and the Epanagoge, which were legal compilations invalidating parts of the Ecloga and restoring the Justinian laws.105106 The Prochiron served as the basis for the legal writings of the twelfth-century first archbishop of Serbia, Saint Sava. His legal compilation was intended for the Serbian church but the influential work was adopted as the basic constitution for the Bulgarian and Russian orthodox churches.107 Around 900 CE, Emperor Leo VI commissioned the Basilica, a Greek rewriting of the Justinian laws that is considered the ancestor of modern Greece's law until the enactment of the Code of 1940.108
The Codex of Justinian also had a great influence on Western law, particularly on the juridic history and tradition of western Europe and its American colonies. In Italy, a single complete copy of the Justinian Digest survived and laid forgotten until its rediscovery in 1070.109 In 1088, Irnerius, a jurist and teacher of the liberal arts in Bologna, was the first to teach the newly recovered Digest and the rest of Justinian's books. He and his successors explained the Roman laws to their students by means of glosses or explanatory notes written on the edges or between the text lines. The Roman legal concepts resulting from the studies of these &quot;glossators&quot; spread to the universities and law courts of Europe.110 The Roman law revival that started in Italy, during the Middle Ages, was taken up by France, the Netherlands and Germany in later centuries.111 The enactment of the German Civil Code in 1900 put an end to the application of extant forms of law derived from the Justinian codes in most European states.112
The reputation of Beirut as &quot;mother of laws&quot; reemerged in modern times.113 In 1913, Paul Huvelin, the first dean of the newly established Universit&lt;U+00E9&gt; Saint-Joseph's Faculty of Law, dedicated the inaugural speech to the classical law school of Beirut in an effort to confer legitimacy to the new academy.114115 The epithet Berytus Nutrix Legum is used as a motto and as part of the emblem of the Beirut Bar Association, founded in 1919.116 It is also featured in the seal and flag of the Municipality of Beirut.117
