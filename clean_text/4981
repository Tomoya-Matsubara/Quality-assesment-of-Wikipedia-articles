Barda&lt;U+00EF&gt; is a small town and oasis in the extreme north of Chad, the main town of the Tibesti area, one of the four departments of the Bourkou-Ennedi-Tibesti region.
Barda&lt;U+00EF&gt; came to international attention in 1974, when a rebel group, led by Hiss&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne Habr&lt;U+00E9&gt;, attacked the town and captured a French archeologist, Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;oise Claustre and two other European citizens.
