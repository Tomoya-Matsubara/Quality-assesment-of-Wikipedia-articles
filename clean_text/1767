Mylo Xyloto (pronounced ) is the fifth studio album by British alternative rock band Coldplay. It was released worldwide on 24 October 2011 by EMI. It was preceded by the lead single, &quot;Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall&quot;, on 3 June 2011. &quot;Paradise&quot; was released as the second single three months later in September. Internationally, the album charted at number one in seventeen countries. In the United Kingdom, Mylo Xyloto became their fifth album to debut at number one, selling 208,000 units in its first week, and it set a one-week digital sales record with 83,000 copies sold.1 The album became the group's third to debut at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling 447,000 units in the first week. &quot;Paradise&quot; and &quot;Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall&quot; received a total of three Grammy Award nominations. Mylo Xyloto has received mixed-to-favorable reviews from critics.
Writing and recording
Lead singer Chris Martin stated that he does not believe &quot;bands should keep going past the age of 33,&quot;2 but later rephrased this to say that what he meant was that they must proceed &quot;as if it's our last, because that's the only way to proceed&quot; in December 2008, adding that he thought the band would never split.3 Bassist Guy Berryman, who earlier wrote that the band will &quot;just have to start work and see how it shapes up&quot;,4 reported that the band would return to the studio:

&quot;We've already got lists of song ideas. We never stop writing. We go into the studio with all the best laid plans then what we end up with is not what we intended. It's just exciting to wonder what will come out the speakers in a year's time. We have very exciting things lined up. It's time to take our music down different directions and really explore other avenues.&quot;5

In one interview, Chris Martin predicted the style of the incoming album as being less dominated by fanfare, and featuring a more &quot;stripped-down&quot; sound.6

He also said that the title of the new album &quot;will probably begin with an M.&quot;7
In 2008 Coldplay established a recording HQ at a disused bakery in Primrose Hill, North London, where they recorded Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends.8 However they relocated to a vacant church, also in north London, to begin work on their fifth album in collaboration with Brian Eno.91011
Style
Mylo Xyloto is a concept album, and its contents follows a story throughout. According to Chris Martin, the album is &quot;based on a love story with a happy ending,&quot; in which two protagonists living in an oppressive, dystopian, urban environment, meet one another through a gang and fall in love. Lyrically, the album is inspired by &quot;old school American graffiti&quot; and &quot;the White Rose Movement.&quot; Martin also said that the album was influenced by HBO TV series The Wire.12 Coldplay have stated on several occasions that they want their next studio album to be &quot;more acoustic&quot; and &quot;more intimate&quot; than its predecessor, 2008's Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends.
Release and promotion
The album was set to be released in December 2010 as a &quot;decade-ender&quot;, but was postponed to 2011 since the album was far from finished as Coldplay concluded their Viva la Vida Tour. Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland mentioned that the album would be released in the latter year.
The iTunes Store let users hear one new song from the album every day until the album was released.
The album was released on the 24 October 2011 on CD and on vinyl. A special edition of the album that includes the CD, digital copy and LP disc along with copies of the bands studio notes, stencils, a poster, a pop up book and stickers will also be available on the 12 December 2011.13

Paradise has so far reached #15 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and has reached the top 10 in 15 charts around the world.18
On 19 October, &quot;Princess of China&quot; was misquoted by Billboard as the third single from the album.19 It was confirmed on the Coldplay website that no such release had been made by Coldplay or their label, Parlophone.20

Reception
Critical reception

Mylo Xyloto has received mixed-to-favourable reviews from music critics. According to critic review aggregator Metacritic, the album has received a score of 65/100, based on 38 reviews, indicating generally favorable reviews.23 Spin rated the record 7/10, saying that like its predecessor, &quot;Mylo Xyloto draws from an expansive palette that makes Coldplay's first three albums sound even quainter&quot;. The reviewer noted that &quot;where Viva La Vida showcased Coldplay's sense of adventure, this [album] feels more eager to please&quot;.24 In a three-star review, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian judged the record's storyline to lack coherence, and he was sceptical of the album's purported pop influences, writing, &quot;A lot of it just sounds like standard-issue Coldplay, replete with echoing guitars, woah-oh choruses and vocals that signify high drama by slipping into falsetto&quot;. He did praise the electronic flourishes, saying that there was &quot;deftness with which Coldplay weave the electronics around their sound&quot; and it &quot;genuinely adds a bit of freshness to a formulaic sound&quot;.25 Josh Eels of Rolling Stone gave the album a score of three-and-a-half stars, calling it their most ambitious effort and saying that &quot;the choruses are bigger, the textures grander, the optimism more optimistic. It's a bear-hug record for a bear-market world.&quot;26 In a review for Entertainment Weekly, Melissa Maerz gave the record a &quot;C+&quot;, interpreting it as an attempt by the group to sound less like themselves in order to reconcile their commercial success with the supposed stigma of being &quot;as hated as a band can be&quot;. She wrote that &quot;it's strange to hear Martin insist that it's 'us against the world'&quot;, particularly &quot;within the same kind of expansive, soaring guitar-pop that's so adored by the world they're supposedly bucking against&quot;. Maerz concluded, &quot;The world doesn't seem sick of Coldplay, but maybe they're sick of themselves.&quot;27 IGN gave the album a score of 8/10, with IGN calling it an &quot;epic record that will doubtless sell by the planet-load despite a ridiculous name&quot;. Sputnikmusic awarded the album 10/10, stating that &quot;Mylo Xyloto proves that coldplay are quite simply the best pop/rock band in the world, bar none&quot;.
Q awarded the record a maximum score of five stars, saying, &quot;their fifth album will, at the bare minimum, safely sustain their imperial position for a long time to come&quot;. Martin was praised for his vocals and Buckland for &quot;riffs [that] twinkle and flare like meteor showers&quot;, as were Eno and Dravs for &quot;spar[ing] nothing here in the way of sonic stardust&quot;. The review concluded, &quot;Music this uplifting, this inspirational, belongs among the stars.&quot;28 The Daily Telegraph{{'}}s Neil McCormick called the record &quot;irresistible&quot;, writing that its &quot;mood is adventurous and the sound is luxuriously colourful, Martin's hook-laden piano lines are overlaid with sparkling guitar motifs and driven along by simple, direct beats.&quot;29However, Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times, in a one and a half star review, said that the record &quot;sees the most appealingly unoriginal band of the '00s continuing on its path of least resistance by offering vague, neutral opening lines such as 'Once upon a time somebody ran away.'&quot; Roberts was critical of Martin's lyrics, explaining, &quot;Every touch of lyrical bitterness is followed by enough sugar to mask the taste, which might be good in the short term but isn't a recipe for long-term health.&quot;30 Martin Aston of BBC Music praised the album as &quot;A triumphant fifth LP which reveals familiar strengths in all the right places&quot;.31 Allmusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave Mylo Xyloto three-and-a-half stars out of five, writing, that it &quot;has a leg up other Coldplay records for this simple reason: they're no longer attempting to mimic U2's portentous piety. They've embraced their schoolboy selves and are simply singing songs of love and good cheer, albeit on a grand scale that somehow seems smaller due to the group's insuppressible niceness.&quot;32
