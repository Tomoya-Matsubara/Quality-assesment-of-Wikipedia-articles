Live Performances
From 1997 onwards, the voice actors of the series performed onstage and in-character as their Sakura Wars counterparts in a series of live-action musical stage shows. By 2001 to 2006, the Teikoku Kagekidan (Imperial Assault Force) performed two major musicals in a year: a New Year's Show and a Summer Kayou Show, in addition to multitudes of other smaller shows where one or more characters make appearances. Some of the stage performances could be seen in the series' other forms of media.
In August of 2006, the Teikoku Kagekidan held their final summer show. Although the live-action shows still continue as of May 2007, they are no longer focused entirely on the Teikoku Kagekidan.
