The main block of the school was opened in 1912 as the O Street Vocational School. It was designed by District of Columbia Municipal Architect Snowden Ashford.1 The school was renamed for Margaret Murray Washington, the wife of Booker T. Washington, in 1926. She had been a leader of several black feminist organizations and the anti-lynching movement. Additions designed by Albert Harris and Albert Cassell were added in 1928 and 1938 respectively. A gymnasium was added in 1971.
The curriculum provided &lt;U+201C&gt;manual training for boys and domestic science and art for girls.&lt;U+201D&gt;2 Nursing was added during World War II and it was accredited afterwards. The school offered instruction to students at area elementary schools as well as high-school-age students who made up its student body.
The building has been vacant for several years. There are plans to convert the facility into 82 affordable apartments, as well as recreation and community meeting space.
