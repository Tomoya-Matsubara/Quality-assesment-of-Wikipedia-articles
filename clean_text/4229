Rostislav was a pre-dreadnought battleship built by the Black Sea Shipyard Nikolaev Admiralty in the 1890s for the Black Sea Fleet of the Imperial Russian Navy. She was conceived as a small, inexpensive coastal defence ship, but the Navy abandoned the concept in favour of a compact seagoing battleship with a displacement of Convert 8880 LT t lk=on. Overloading caused by poor design and construction practices increased her actual displacement by more than Convert 10000 LT t lk=on abbr=on. Rostislav became the world's first capital ship to burn fuel oil, rather than coal.Willmott, p. 57. Her combat ability was compromised by the use of convert 10 in adj=on 0 main guns instead of the de facto Russian standard of convert 12 in 0.

Her hull was launched in September 1896, but non-delivery of the ship's main guns delayed her maiden voyage until 1899 and her completion until 1900. In May 1899 Rostislav became the first ship of the Imperial Navy to be commanded by a member of the House of Romanov, Captain Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia Alexander Mikhailovich.Melnikov, p. 12. From 1903 to 1912 Rostislav was the flagship junior flagship of the Black Sea Fleet. During the 1905 Russian Revolution her crew was on the verge of mutiny but remained loyal to the regime and actively suppressed the mutiny of the cruiser ship Russian cruiser Ochakov  2.

Rostislav was actively engaged in World War I until the collapse of the Black Sea Fleet in the beginning of 1918. She was the first Russian ship to open fire against enemy targets on land during World War I, the first Russian ship to be hit by a German airstrike, and the first one to destroy a submarine, albeit Karp class submarine a Russian one. In April 1918 the fleeing Bolsheviks abandoned Rostislav in Sevastopol. One year later the British occupation forces permanently disabled her engines. The White movement White forces reused the ship as a towed floating battery and scuttled her in the Strait of Kerch in November 1920.

Design and description

Rostislav was conceived in 1892 as a cheap and compact platform for 12-inch guns, similar in size to earlier coastal defence ships, but possessing proper seagoing capabilities for operations in the Black Sea. Admiral Nikolay Chikhachov, Chief of the Ministry of the Navy, envisioned that a squadron of such ships, each displacing four to five thousand tonnes, that would fit into his total desired displacement target of convert 24000 LT t lk=on. Chief designer of the Black Sea Shipyard Nikolaev Admiralty Shipyard, Sergey Ratnik,In the very beginning of 1893 Ratnik moved from Nikolaev to Saint Petersburg and became chief executive of privately-owned Baltic Shipyard. - Melnikov, p. 4. evaluated Chikhachov's request for proposals, and advised against the idea in general. The Naval Technical Committee NTC concurred: any meaningful combination of fire power, armour, speed and stability required at least convert 6000 LT t. The NTC discarded Ratnik's advice to build an improved copy of the battleship ship Russian battleship Sissoi Veliky  2 of convert 8880 LT t, but did not present a definite alternative. The NTC declined to discuss tactical matters, leaving the choice of armament to Chikhachov.Melnikov, p. 4.

Chikhachov, appalled by the bureaucratic games of his staff, instructed Andrey Toropov of Nikolaev Admiralty to draft two proposals, one armed with 10-inch and the other with 12-inch guns.Melnikov, p. 5. Toropov estimated that the ship should have displaced at least convert 8880 LT t. Chikhachov admitted the fact and presented the two options to the NTC. The admiral himself and the active fleet commanders voted for the 12-inch calibre, which had already become a worldwide battleship standard, but the NTC strongly advised against it. The Navy Official brass spent April and May 1893 in lengthy debates. They agreed to increase displacement to 8,880 tons and were leaning towards accepting 12-inch guns when General Admiral Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia Grand Duke Alexey resolved the discussion in favor of the smaller calibre.Melnikov, p. 8.

Rostislav's hull was a carbon copy of Sissoi Veliky, protected with newly developed Harvey armour. She was also the first Russian battleship to use electric power to wikt:train train her guns, instead of older hydraulic systems.

General characteristics
Rostislav was convert 345 ft 6 in 1 length at the waterline long at the waterline and convert 351 ft 10 in 1 long length overall overall. She had a beam nautical beam of convert 68 ft 1 and a draft hull draught of convert 25 ft 2 in 1. She displaced  convert 10520 LT t lk=on, over convert 1500 LT t abbr=on more than her designed displacement of convert 8880 LT t abbr=on.McLaughlin, p. 93. This weight gain increased her draft by about convert 3 ft 1, which submerged most, if not all, of her waterline armored belt.McLaughlin, p. 96.

Propulsion
Rostislav had two Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion vertical triple expansion steam engines, identical to those of Sissoi Veliky, that had a total designed output of convert 8500 ihp lk=on. Eight cylindrical fire-tube boilers, four singled-ended and four double-ended, provided steam to the engines, each of which drove one propeller. Half of the boilers were coal-fired and the other half were oil-fired, making Rostislav the first major warship in the world to use fuel oil.Silverstone, p. 366. On sea trials, the power plant produced a total of convert 8816 ihp lk=on and a top speed of convert 15.8 kn lk=on. She carried a maximum of convert 820 LT MT of fuel oil and coal at full load that provided a range of convert 3100 nmi lk=on at a speed of convert 8 kn.McLaughlin, pp. 93, 97.

Armament
The main armament consisted of two pairs of convert 10 in mm 0 adj=on 45-caliber artillery calibre Model 1891 guns mounted in French-style centre-pivot twin gun turrets fore and aft. Each turret had an arc of fire of 240.McLaughlin, p. 95. These guns had a maximum elevation of 15 and could depress to 5. 80 rounds per gun were carried. They fired a convert 496.5 lb kg adj=on shell at a muzzle velocity of convert 2273 ft/s m/s abbr=on. Maximum range was convert 18412 yd m at an elevation of 35, although Rostislavs guns had a maximum elevation of less than half that.cite web url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNRussian_10-45_m1891.htm title=Russian 10/45 25.4 cm Pattern 1891 date=5 December 2006 publisher=Navweps.com  accessdate=15 August 2010

All eight of the 6-inch Canet guns Canet Pattern Pattern 1892 45-calibre guns were mounted in turrets on the main deck. Each turret was positioned at a corner of the superstructure and had an arc of fire of 110. The guns could elevate to a maximum of 20 and depress to 6. Each gun was provided with 180 rounds. They fired shells that weighed convert 91.27 lb kg abbr=on with a muzzle velocity of convert 2600 ft/s m/s abbr=on. They had a maximum range of convert 12600 yd m when fired at maximum elevation.cite web url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNRussian_6-45_m1892.htm title=Russian 6/45 15.2 cm Pattern 1892 152 mm/45 6 Pattern 1892 date=12 January 2009 publisher=Navweaps.com  accessdate=15 August 2010

The anti-torpedo boat armament consisted of twelve convert 47 mm in adj=on Hotchkiss guns. Eight of these were mounted in the superstructure and the locations of the remaining four are unclear. They fired a convert 3.3 lb kg adj=on shell at a muzzle velocity of convert 1476 ft/s m/s abbr=on at a rate of 20 rounds per minute to a range of convert 2020 yd m.cite web url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNRussian_47mm_Hotchkiss.htm title=Russia 47 mm/5 1.85 Hotchkiss gun 47 mm/1 1.85 Hotchkiss gun 3-pdr 1.4 kg Hotchkiss guns  date=1 December 2006 accessdate=22 December 2009 The ship also mounted sixteen convert 37 mm in adj=on Hotchkiss guns, eight of which were carried in the Top sailing ship fighting top. The locations of the other eight are unknown. They fired a convert 1.1 lb kg adj=on shell at a muzzle velocity of convert 1450 ft/s m/s abbr=on at a rate of 20 rounds per minute. Their maximum range was convert 3038 yd m.cite web url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNRussian_37mm_Hotchkiss.htm title=Russia 37 mm/5 1.5 Hotchkiss Gun 37 mm/1 1.5 Hotchkiss Gun 1-pdr 0.45 kg Hotchkiss Guns  date=1 December 2006 accessdate=22 December 2009

Rostislav carried six convert 15 in mm 0 adj=on torpedo tubes. Four were above water, one each in the bow and stern and the aft pair of broadside tubes. The forward broadside tubes were underwater. The ship carried 50 Naval mine mines to be used to protect her anchorage.McLaughlin, pp. 9596.

Protection
Rostislav used Harvey armour. The maximum thickness of the Belt armor waterline belt was convert 14.5 in mm 0 which reduced to convert 10 in mm 0 abreast the magazine artillery magazines. It covered convert 227 ft m 1 of the ship's length and was convert 7 ft 1 high. While the exact height of the belt above the designed waterline is unknown, much of it, if not not all, would have been below the waterline as the ship's draught was over convert 3 ft 1 deeper than designed. The belt terminated forward in a convert 9 in mm 0 adj=on transverse bulkhead partition bulkhead and aft in a convert 5 in mm 0 adj=on bulkhead. The upper belt was 5&nbsp;inches thick, convert 7 ft 6 in m 1 high and covered convert 160 ft m 1 of the ship's side. The sides of the main gun turrets were 10&nbsp;inches thick and they had convert 2.5 in mm 0 adj=on roofs. The sides of the 6-inch turrets were 6&nbsp;inches thick as were the side of the conning tower. The armour deck ship deck was flat and located at the upper edge of the main belt. It was convert 2 in 0 thick. Below the waterline, forward and aft of the armoured citadel were convert 3 in mm 0 adj=on decks.McLaughlin, pp. 9697.

Construction
Work on Rostislav commenced OldStyleDateNY January 30 January 17, 1894.Melnikov, p. 9. The ship was officially christened OldStyleDateNY May 20 May 7, 1894; in line with Russian tradition, the formal laying down ceremony was delayed until OldStyleDateNY May 19 May 6, 1895. The contract for oil-firing boiler steam generator boilers and engines was awarded to Baltic Shipyard Baltic Works. The armor was rolled in the United States by Bethlehem Steel within the framework of an earlier contract for Petropavlovsk class battleships.http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C02E3DA113AE533A25755C2A9679D94649ED7CF Russia Buys Armor Here: The New Battle Ship Rostislav. The New York Times, November 26, 1895. The Russians paid an unusually low introductory price of $250300 per ton, compared to $600$660 paid by the United States Navy.http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B03E7D91F39E433A25753C3A9619C94669ED7CF Prices for Armor Plate. The New York Times, July 30, 1897. Bethlehem Steel delivered armor on time but faced scrutiny of the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services Senate Committee on Naval Affairs. Senator Benjamin Tillman publicly accused Bethlehem and Carnegie Steel Company Carnegie of price fixing and robbing the American taxpayer.According to senator Benjamin Tillman, Carnegie Works and Bethlehem Steel formed a trust with an intent to rob the U.S. government on naval armor contracts. The law obliged the U.S. Navy to purchase only U.S.-made steel, thus eliminating competitive choices open to other navies. As a result, the U.S. Navy paid $660 a ton when foreign governments paid only $300. - http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C04E1D6143BEE33A2575BC2A9629C94679ED7CF Serving Two Masters: Naval Officers Employed by Armor Plate Makers. The New York Times, April 28, 1896.

Rostislav's hull was launched on OldStyleDateNY September 2 August 20, 1896. Lack of proper cranes in Mykolaiv Nikolaev turned the installation of its engines into an engineering nightmare, and the Navy even considered towing the hull to Sevastopol for completion. The Nikolaev engineers eventually resolved the problem and the ship was ready to sail in July 1897. Rostislav conducted her sea trial speed trials held on OldStyleDateNY October 21 October 8, 1898, still missing her main guns. Her power plant performed flawlessly, but also became a statement of the designers' incompetence as its weight exceeded the design target by more than convert 300 t LT.Melnikov, p. 10.

Non-delivery of the new 10-inch Model 1897 guns, made by the Obukhov State Plant Obukhov Factory in Saint Petersburg for Rostislav, sclass Admiral Ushakov coast defense ships and sclass Peresvet battleships, delayed the completion of Rostislav by two years. One of these guns, earmarked for Admiral Ushakov, burst at the proving ground and the whole batch was subjected to exhaustive tests and, when possible, repairs. Guns number 16 to 19 passed the tests and were delivered to Sevastopol in JulyAugust 1899. Rostislav was able to sail for her first gunnery trial on OldStyleDateNY April 12 March 30, 1900.Melnikov, p. 11. On the second day of shooting practice the shock absorber recoil mechanisms of her forward turret failed and more defects were discovered back at the base. Rostislav spent the rest of the spring having her gun mounts repaired,Melnikov, p. 12. but the problem persisted and the Navy solved it by prohibiting them from being used. The gun mounts were rebuilt along the pattern of those used by the armoured cruiser ship Russian armoured cruiser Admiral Nakhimov  2 in 19011902; Rostislav successfully passed the gunnery tests in June 1902. The commission noted that her electrical turret controls were unnecessarily complex. Their 332 Electrical connector contact pairs required tedious maintenance and they were too complex for most of the enlisted men.Melnikov, p. 14.

Service
Junior flagship
On OldStyleDateNY May 1 May 14, 1899 Captain naval Captain Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich assumed command of Rostislav, becoming the first House of Romanov Romanov since Peter I of Russia Peter I to actually command a combat ship. Another Romanov, Cyril Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia Grand Duke Kirill, spent a few uneventful months on board of Rostislav in 1900.Melnikov, p. 13. Alexander's guests, parties and diplomatic visits to Istanbul regularly interfered into daily service of the crew. On the other hand, Alexander wisely limited such occasions to a reasonable minimum, and personally managed the repairs and alterations of Rostislavs equipment. Shipyards and contractors treated Rostislav as a priority customer. Alexander, based on his experience with Russian battleship Sissoi Veliky Sisoy Veliky, persuaded the NTC to reinforce Rostislavs rudder frame and supervised installation of a backup control post deep under the conning tower. In 1903 Alexander was promoted to rear admiral and returned to his ship as a squadron commander.Melnikov, p. 17. Rostislav served as the junior flagship of the Black Sea Fleet until September 1912.Melnikov, p. 28.

The 1900 season revealed grave problems with Rostislavs boilers. Black smoke from burning oil turned out more conspicuous than ordinary coal smoke. Uneven distribution of heat inside the boilers caused severe local overheating, buckling of Firebox steam engine fireboxes and sudden backdrafts. In three and a half months the boilers failed one by one, starting with small auxiliary power units and ending with the main boilers. Oil delivered by the Rothschild family Rothschild-controlled Russian Standard Oil was not at fault; similar problems were experienced by oil-fired ships of the Baltic Fleet.Melnikov, pp. 1718.
Repairs and alterations of the power plant continued until 1904, when the continuing boiler failures compelled the Navy to dispense with oil fuel and Rostislav was converted to coal in 19041905.Melnikov, p. 21. Each round of repairs and alterations added more weight to the already overloaded ship, and by 1907 the ship's belt armor was completely below the waterline.

On OldStyleDate June 27 1905 June 14, the day of the Russian battleship Potemkin battleship Potemkin mutiny Rostislav was sailing under the ensign of Vice Admiral Alexander Krieger. Nicholas II of Russia Nicholas II ordered Krieger and his superior, fleet commander Grigory Chukhnin, to destroy the rebels by force, but the admirals wisely refrained from a shooting battle. They let the rebels flee to Odessa and later to Romania. Krieger's own crew was on the verge of open mutiny.Melnikov, p. 22. On July 2, 1905 a military council held on board Rostislav decided to moor the ships in Odessa, disconnect the engines from the propellers and let the enlisted men walk ashore at will.http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D0CE1DA173DE733A25750C0A9619C946497D6CF Black Sea Fleet to be Disbanded. The New York Times, July 3, 1905. By the time of the Russian cruiser Ochakov Ochakov mutiny in November 1905, fleet morale had improved and Krieger did not hesitate to fire two 10-inch and fourteen 6-inch shells against the rebels.

Exercises and casualties
After the Battle of Tsushima the Imperial Navy concentrated on improving their gunnery skills and fire-control practices.Melnikov, pp. 2324. In 1908 Alexei Krylov and Yevgeny Berkalov led Rostislav on an unprecedented long-range gunnery shoot: Rostislav fired 330 10-inch shells at a distance of eight to ten miles in a few days. The experiment proved that the older Range of a projectile ballistic tables used by the Navy were highly inaccurate. Berkalov compiled the data from the 1908 exercise into the new tables adopted by the Navy. Another of Krylov's initiatives, rapid Glossary_of_nautical_terms#C counter-flooding, was standardised in 1909.Melnikov, p. 28.

Two plans for modernizing the ship were put forward before World War I. In 1907 the Naval General Staff proposed a major reconstruction aimed at reducing her displacement and raising her armour belt higher out of the water. Her above-water torpedo tubes, torpedo nets auxiliary boilers and 47-millimetre guns would be removed, her superstructure cut down and her rigging reduced to a single pole mast. These changes would reduce her displacement by convert 250 LT t, but the plan was rejected due to a shortage of money.McLaughlin, p. 288. Her above-water torpedo tubes, however, were removed about the same time.McLaughlin, p. 294. In 1912 the staff of the Black Sea Fleet proposed to replace all of her 47&nbsp;mm guns with four convert 75 mm 0 adj=on guns and to removed the auxiliary boilers and the submerged torpedo tubes to offset the additional weight. The Naval General Staff did not think that this was worth the cost and rejected the plan. Even though these plans did not come to fruition, other alterations were made to Rostislav before the war. A dozen of her 37&nbsp;mm guns were removed in 1906 and she was fitted with convert 15 ft 1 adj=on rangefinders, probably from Barr and Stroud, in 190708.

In 190910 Rostislav and the rest of Black Sea Fleet was prepared for joint operations with submarines. She was scheduled to equipped with the first Russian underwater acoustic communication system; the installation was interrupted and her hardware was installed on the battleship Russian battleship Potemkin Panteleimon the former Potemkin instead.Godin and Palmer, p. 33. During the anti-submarine exercise held on the night of June 1112 O.S. May 2829, 1909 Rostislav accidentally rammed and sank the submarine Karp class submarine Kambala. Twenty men of Kambala and two rescue divers died.http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D0CE2D6173EE033A25750C1A9609C946897D6CF St. Petersburg, June 12. The New York Times, June 13, 1909.http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9505EFD6153EE733A25757C1A9609C946897D6CF Submarine Crew Past Aid. The New York Times, June 14, 1909. The accident was blamed on reckless manoeuvring of the submarine and Rostislav's captain was cleared of any wrongdoing.Melnikov, p. 26.

Diplomatic incidents

Before the outbreak of World War I Rostislav was involved in two minor international incidents. On OldStyleDate August 11 1911 July 29 two of the Black Sea Fleet battleships paying a state visit to Romania ran aground on a shoal just off the port of Constana. Rostislav's officers detected the hazard and steered her to safety, but did nothing to alert ship Russian battleship Evstafi  2 and Panteleimon.Melnikov, p. 28. The international embarrassment led to the resignation of fleet commander Admiral Ivan Bostrem. During the First Balkan War Rostislav sailed into the Sea of Marmara to protect the Russian Embassy from the mob of Istanbul.The international observation fleet comprised 21 ship, including Rostislav, SMS Goeben Goeben and French armoured cruiser Lon Gambetta Lon Gambetta. - Melnikov, p. 29. Here she created another diplomatic incident by accidentally firing a live shell into the Turkish defenses. No one was injured and the captain defused the conflict with a personal apology to the Ottoman government.Melnikov, p. 2930.

World War I
further SMS Goeben, Caucasus Campaign, Romania during World War I

Rostislav spent the winter of 191314 refitting, in April 1914 she returned to the active fleet with newly overhauled machinery, new rangefinders and gun sights.Melnikov, p. 31. The ship made convert 15.37 kn on her post-refit trials.

On OldStyleDateNY November 4 October 22, 1914 the Black Sea Fleet sailed out on its first combat operation of the warthe bombardment of Zonguldak. The operation was conceived as a retaliation against the SMS_Goeben#1914 Turkish-German attack on Sevastopol. Rostislav, captained by Kazimierz Porbski, was the designated gunboat while other Russian battleships formed a defensive screen around her. On OldStyleDateNY November 6 October 24 Rostislav fired 251 shells at the port of Zonguldak reducing it to rubble.Melnikov, p. 32. On OldStyleDateNY November 18 November 5 Rostislav faced Goeben during the Battle of Cape Sarych, but the German ship broke contact before Rostislav, trailing behind the Russian formation, even spotted her.Melnikov, p. 34. Rostislav had other encounters with Goeben in 1915 and 1916, but did not engage her directly.Admiral Andrei Eberhardt deliberately kept Rostislav out of action to protect the old ship from a vastly superior enemy. He reasoned that a ship with 10-inch guns had no place in a fight of 12-inch guns as had already been proven by the loss of SMS Blcher in the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915. - Melnikov, pp. 3536. In 1915 the ship received four 75&nbsp;mm Anti-aircraft warfare anti-aircraft guns.McLaughlin, p. 310.

After the commissioning of the sclass Imperatritsa Mariya battleship 0 dreadnoughts, the old battleships were split into independent combat groups. Rostislav became the flagship of the Batumi Group tasked with supporting the ground operations of the Russian Caucasus Army Caucasus Army.Melnikov, p. 36. Their first joint action began February 5, 1916 near Arhavi. On the first day alone Rostislav fired four hundred shells against the Turks.Melnikov, p. 36. On March 4 Rostislav, and the gunboats Kubanetz and Donetz supported the amphibious landing at Pazar Atina.Willmott, p. 305. Three days later Rostislav supported the landing of marines that ended in the capture of Rize. At the end of March Rostislav and Panteleimon forced the Turks to evacuate Trabzon.

In the summer of 1916 the Navy seriously considered an all-out amphibious assault of the Bosphorus.Melnikov, p. 39. Fleet commander Andrei Eberhardt anticipated high risk of naval mine and torpedo hits in the coastal waters and suggested equipping all pre-dreadnought battleships with anti-torpedo bulges. ship Russian battleship Sinop  2 had her bulges fitted in Nikolaev in July 1916, Rostislav was next in line, but the work was cancelled in August.Melnikov, p. 40. Instead of a proper refit Rostislav was transferred to the Romanian coast as flagship of the Constanta Group. Constana temporarily became an important logistical hub for the Russian troops heading to the Romanian Front, and the base for minelayers, submarines and destroyers harassing the enemy in the Bosphorus area. The Germans responded with air raids; their first aerial success against a Russian naval target was scored against Rostislav. The bomb hit the edge of the aft 10-inch turret and injured sixteen sailors. The turret itself remained fully operational. The Romania_during_World_War_I#The_counteroffensive_of_the_Central_Powers_.28September-December_1916.29 collapse of the Romanian Front in October 1916 forced the Navy to evacuate Constana. Rostislav returned to Sevastopol for a much-needed overhaul.Melnikov, p. 38.

Revolution
further Russian Revolution 1917, Russian Civil War, Entente intervention in the Russian Civil War

The February Revolution of 1917 did not demoralize the Black Sea Fleet as quickly as the Baltic Fleet. Captain Fyodor Stark 18761939, a former destroyer commander, maintained Rostislav in combat-ready condition until the end of the year.Melnikov, p. 41. The battleship sailed out for her last voyage to Batumi in September-October. Stark managed to contain radical politics, anti-German sentiment and Ukrainization of the crew, but nevertheless raised the flag of Ukraine on his return to Sevastopol on OldStyleDateNY October 25 October 12.Melnikov, pp. 41 and 42. From this moment desertion and volunteering into the Red Guards Russia Red Guards intensified and by OldStyleDateNY December 21 December 8 the crew was reduced to 460 enlisted men and 28 officers.Melnikov, p. 42. In January 1918 the fleet disintegrated completely: the officers fled from the enraged enlisted men, while the enlisted men abandoned the ships and fled from the advancing German Army.Melnikov, p. 44. On April 29, 1918 the Bolsheviks managed to extricate two battleships and sixteen destroyers from Sevastopol to Novorossiysk, but Rostislav and the rest of the fleet remained in Sevastopol.

German occupation of Crimea in MayNovember 1918 did not affect the abandoned ship. The Anglo-French forces that replaced the Germans stayed in Sevastopol until April 1919.Melnikov, p. 46.
