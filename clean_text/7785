Californication is the seventh studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. Released on June 8, 1999 (see 1999 in music) on the Warner Bros. label, it saw John Frusciante, who had previously appeared on Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, replace Dave Navarro as the band's guitarist. The album produced many hits for the band, including &quot;Around the World&quot;, &quot;Otherside&quot;, &quot;Californication&quot; and Grammy-award winning &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;. Californication is the Chili Peppers' best-selling album to date, reaching #3 on the US Billboard 200 and selling more than 15 million copies worldwide.12 It marked a change in style for the Chili Peppers; Greg Tate of Rolling Stone magazine noted that &quot;while all previous Chili Peppers projects have been highly spirited, Californication dares to be spiritual and epiphanal&quot;.3
The title Californication is sometimes mistaken as a portmanteau of &quot;California&quot; and &quot;fornication&quot;. However, in an interview with MTV in 2000, band member Anthony Kiedis stated that it is a not a sexual reference and that &quot;californication&quot; is &quot;the act of the world being affected and saturated by the art and the culture being born and raised in California&quot;.4
Background
In the years following guitarist John Frusciante's departure from the band, it became known that he had developed a heroin addiction that left him in poverty and near death.5 He was talked into admitting himself to drug rehabilitation in January 1998.6 In April 1998, following Frusciante's three month completion, Flea visited his former band-mate and openly invited him to re-join the band, an invitation an emotional Frusciante readily accepted. Within the week and, for the first time in six years, the reunited foursome gathered to play, and jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers.7
Writing and composition
 A considerable amount of the album's formation took place in the band member's homes in the summer of 1998. Kiedis and Frusciante often spent days together at each other's homes, discussing song creation, guitar riffs and lyrical content. Much of the instrumental formation was pieced together through jam sessions, although this unrestricted nature was not present in the finished album which favored a more structured song configuration.8
While most of the album progressed rapidly, Californication itself remained a difficult song to put together. Frusciante felt compelled to write an appropriate guitar ensemble to accompany the powerful lyrics, but encountered difficulty.9 The song was barely making progress, and was nearly scrapped had it not been for Kiedis' urgency to include it on the album. Only two days before the album&lt;U+2019&gt;s initial recording ended did Frusciante set the final riff into place, and taught the rest of the band how to perform it. Californication is, essentially, a detailed classification of California, and, more specifically, the &quot;fake&quot; nature which is associated with much of Hollywood.
Californication's lyrics were derived from Anthony Kiedis' ideas, outlooks, and perceptions of life and its meaning. &quot;Porcelain&quot; resulted after Kiedis met a young mother at the YMCA, who was attempting to battle her alcohol addiction whilst living with her infant daughter.10 Sarcasm had also been lingering in his mind for quite some time and he decided to devote an entire song to the concept. Kiedis found inspiration from former band mate Dave Navarro, who he considered the &quot;King of Sarcasm&quot;.11 Frusciante began playing a poignant guitar riff, which Kiedis immediately saw integrating smoothly into &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;. Running outside with joy, he saw birds flying gracefully overhead which inspired the lyric &quot;With the birds I'll share this lonely view.&quot;12
The album was a change of style for the Chili Peppers, especially when compared to their previous album, which combined various elements of psychedelic rock and Hard Rock. Although Californication still contained their once essential &quot;funk rock&quot; trademark sound (such as &quot;Purple Stain&quot;, &quot;Get On Top&quot;, &quot;I Like Dirt&quot; and &quot;Around the World&quot; and &lt;U+201C&gt;Right on Time&lt;U+201D&gt;), it leaned towards more melodic and epic oriented melodies (for example, &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; and &quot;Otherside&quot;) and focused on songs with implemented structure rather than jams. Alternative rock was tangible in tracks like &lt;U+201C&gt;Easily&lt;U+201D&gt; and &lt;U+201C&gt;Emit Remmus&lt;U+201D&gt;.13 This change was attributed by Greg Prato of All Music Guide to the return of Frusciante to the lineup.14
His return came with a more experimental style; one song in particular, &quot;Emit Remmus&quot;, features a repeating guitar riff that was deliberately recorded backwards (hence the title &quot;Emit Remmus&quot;, &quot;Summer Time&quot; backwards).15 Experimental guitar work is consistent in &quot;Savior&quot;, and &lt;U+201C&gt;This Velvet Glove&lt;U+201D&gt;, as a Mellotron and other distortion methods were employed. The album includes multiple references to drugs and Hollywood.16
Release and critical recognition
Californication was released on CD on June 8, 1999. It was certified 'gold' just over a month later, on July 22 1999, and its continuing sales have resulted in it being certified five-times multi-platinum.17 With the return of John Frusciante playing guitar, the Red Hot Chili Peppers managed to regain their critical acceptance after its less popular predecessor, One Hot Minute, and it has achieved a far greater commercial success worldwide.1819
&quot;Scar Tissue&quot; won a Grammy award for best rock song in 2000.20 Over the years Californication has remained popular; in 2003, the album was ranked number 399 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time and, in 2006, the Chili Peppers recorded a five-set playlist for AOL Sessions that included &quot;Californication&quot; and &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;.212223 The album produced many staple hits for the Chili Peppers, so much so that five of the fifteen songs on their Greatest Hits album were taken from Californication.24
The album has received criticism for what Tim Anderson of The Guardian called &quot;excessive compression and distortion&quot; in the process of digital remastering,25 and was the subject of an online petition with garnered over 1,000 signatures.26
In March 2006, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' albums were made available to purchase on iTunes.27 Albums bought there included new previously unreleased tracks. The original tracks, unlike the bonus tracks, were not remastered.
