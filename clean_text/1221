In the seventh episode, the queens had to create and promote their autobiographies. Raven's book, Young, Broke, and Fabulous was the winner.10 In episode 8, the contestants were tasked with making over older gentlemen as their &quot;drag mothers.&quot; Raven and her drag mother, Golda LaMay,11 won the challenge.12 Although he ended up as the runner-up of the second season's competition, Petruschin has criticized the way he was portrayed on Drag Race, and felt the show's editors purposely edited the show's segments in order to portray him as a villain.
