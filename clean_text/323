The Pacific-10 Conference (Pac-10) is a college athletic conference which operates in the western United States. It participates in the NCAA's Division I; its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS; formerly Division I-A), the higher of two levels of NCAA Division I football competition. The conference's 10 members (which are primarily flagship research universities in their respective regions, well-regarded academically, and with relatively large student enrollment) compete in 22 NCAA sports. It was founded as the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU) in 1959, and went by the names Big Five, Big Six, and Pacific-8, becoming the Pacific-10 in 1978.
The self-proclaimed &quot;Conference of Champions,&quot; the Pac-10 has won more NCAA National Team Championships than any other conference in history. In fact, the top three schools with the most NCAA championships belong to the Pac-10 (UCLA, Stanford and the University of Southern California); while UCLA holds the most, winning a combined 106 team championships in men's and women's sports.
During the 2008-09 school year, the Pac-10 conference captured 11 NCAA titles, outstripping any other conference. It was followed by the ACC and Big Ten with five championships each, and by the Big 12 and SEC conferences with four each.
The current commissioner of the conference is Larry Scott who replaced Thomas C. Hansen, who retired in July 2009 after 26 years in that position.1 Prior to joining the Pac-10, Scott was Chairman and CEO of the Women's Tennis Association.2

History
Pacific Coast Conference

The roots of the Pac-10 Conference go back to December 2, 1915, when the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) was founded at a meeting at the Imperial Hotel in Portland, Oregon32. Charter members were the University of California (now University of California, Berkeley), the University of Washington, the University of Oregon, and Oregon Agricultural College (now Oregon State University). The conference began play in 1916.
One year later, Washington State College (now Washington State University) joined the league, followed by Stanford University in 1918.
In 1922, the PCC expanded to eight teams with the admission of USC and Idaho. Montana joined the Conference in 1924, and in 1928, the PCC grew to 10 members with the addition of UCLA.
For many years, the conference split into two divisions for basketball&lt;U+2014&gt;a Southern Division comprising the four California schools and a Northern Division comprising the six schools in the Pacific Northwest.
In 1950, Montana departed to join the Mountain States Conference. The PCC continued as a nine-team league through 1958.
AAWU (Big Five and Big Six)
Following a &quot;pay-for-play&quot; scandal at several PCC institutions (specifically Cal, USC, UCLA and Washington), the PCC disbanded in 1959. When those four and Stanford started talking about forming a new conference, retired Admiral Thomas J. Hamilton interceded and suggested the schools consider creating a &quot;power conference.&quot; Nicknamed the &quot;Airplane Conference&quot;, the five PCC schools would have played with other big schools including Army, Navy, Air Force, Notre Dame, Penn, Penn State, Duke, and Georgia Tech among others. The effort fell through when a Pentagon official vetoed the idea and the service academies backed out.33
On July 1, 1959 the new Athletic Association of Western Universities was formed, with Cal, Stanford, UCLA, USC, and Washington as charter members. The conference also was popularly known as the Big Five from 1960&lt;U+2013&gt;62;34 when Washington State joined in 1962, the conference was then informally known as the Big Six.35
Pacific-8
Oregon and Oregon State joined in 1964, the term &quot;Pacific-8&quot; became informally used (as there already was a Big Eight Conference). Idaho was never invited to join the AAWU; the Vandals were independent for four years until the formation of the Big Sky Conference in 1963.
In 1968, the AAWU formally renamed itself the Pacific-8 Conference, or Pac-8 for short.
Pacific-10
In 1978, the conference added WAC powers Arizona and Arizona State, to create the Pacific-10 Conference or Pac-10 in its current form.
The Pac-10 claims the PCC's history as its own. It inherited the PCC's berth in the Rose Bowl, and the eight largest schools in the old PCC all eventually joined the new league. However, the older league had a separate charter.
The Pac-10 is one of the founding members of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, a conference organized to provide competition in non-revenue Olympic sports. All Pac-10 members participate in at least one MPSF sport (men's and women's indoor track and field both actually have enough participating Pac-10 schools for the conference to sponsor a championship, but the Pac-10 has opted not to do so), and for certain sports, the Pac-10 admits certain schools as Associate Members (which currently are San Diego State for men's soccer, and UC Davis, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Boise State, Cal State Fullerton, Portland State, and Cal State Bakersfield for wrestling).
The conference expressed interest in admitting Texas after the collapse of the Southwest Conference. Texas expressed an interest in joining a strong academic conference, but joined three fellow SWC schools to combine with the Big Eight Conference to form the Big 12 Conference in 1996.36
Of Division I conferences, only the Ivy League has maintained its current membership for a longer time than the Pac-10. Pac-10 commissioner Larry Scott said on February 9, 2010, that the window for expansion by the conference is open for the next year as the conference begins negotiations for a new television deal. Speaking on a conference call to introduce former Big 12 commissioner Kevin Weiberg as his new deputy, Scott talked about possibly adding new teams to the conference and launching a new television network. Scott, the former head of the Women&lt;U+2019&gt;s Tennis Association, took over the conference last July. In his less than eight months on the job, he has seen growing interest from the membership over the possibility of adding teams for the first time since Arizona and Arizona State joined the conference in 1978.
2010 expansion

In early June 2010, there were reports that the Pac-10 would be considering adding up to six teams to the conference, including Texas Tech University, University of Texas at Austin, University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma State University, University of Colorado at Boulder, and possibly Texas A&amp;M University 3738
On June 10, 2010, the University of Colorado at Boulder officially accepted an invitation to join the Pac-10 Conference, effective in the 2012&lt;U+2013&gt;2013 school year.3940
On June 15, 2010, a deal was reached between Texas and the Big 12 Conference to keep Texas, Texas Tech, Texas A&amp;M, Oklahoma and Oklahoma State in the Big 12. Following Texas' decision, the other Big 12 schools that had been rumored candidates to join the Pac-10 announced they would remain in the Big 12. This deal effectively ended the Pac-10's ambition to potentially become a sixteen team conference.41
On June 17, 2010, the University of Utah officially accepted an invitation to join the Pac-10 Conference, effective in the 2011&lt;U+2013&gt;2012 school year.42 This will make the Pac-10 conference a twelve-team conference when the Utah Utes and Colorado Buffaloes membership becomes effective, immediately preceded by a likely one year period as an eleven-team conference.

Football

Football
 Each school within the conference has its own in-state, conference rivalry. One is an intracity rivalry (UCLA-USC), and another is within the same metropolitan area (Cal-Stanford). These rivalries (and the name given to the football forms) are:

Oregon-Oregon State (The Civil War, the winner's Alumni Association gets the Platypus Trophy but is not recognized by the Universities)
Cal-Stanford (The Big Game, winner gets the Stanford Axe). Notable history includes The Play in 1982 in Berkeley
Arizona-Arizona State (The Duel in the Desert, winner gets the Territorial Cup). Notable history includes &quot;The Catch&quot; of John Jefferson in 1975 to preserve a perfect season for the Sun Devils.
Washington-Washington State (since 1962, the winner gets the Apple Cup), notable history includes the &quot;Snow Bowl&quot; of 1992 in Pullman
UCLA-USC (winner gets the Victory Bell)

There are other notable football rivalries within the Pac-10 conference.
All of the California schools consider each other major rivals, due to the culture clash between Northern and Southern California. For USC, the big game is UCLA. For Stanford, their big game is Cal. But for both Stanford and Cal, their second biggest game is USC.54 Cal and UCLA have a rivalry rooted in their shared history as the top programs within the University of California system. Stanford and USC have a rivalry rooted in their shared history as the only private schools in the Pac-10. Cal and USC also have a long history, having played each other every year in football since 1916.
Oregon and Washington also have an unofficial rivalry (despite recent efforts to give it the name &quot;The Cascade Clash&quot;). All of the Northwest schools consider each other as rivals due to the proximity and long history.
Arizona and New Mexico have a recently renewed rivalry game, based upon when they were both members of the WAC and both states were longtime territories before being admitted as states in 1912. They played for the Kit Carson Rifle trophy, which was no longer used starting with their meeting in the 1997 Insight Bowl.5556
USC and Notre Dame have an intersectional rivalry (See Notre Dame-USC rivalry). The games in odd-numbered years in  Indiana are played in mid-October, while the games in even-numbered years in Los Angeles are usually played in late November.
With the NCAA permanently approving 12-game schedules in college football beginning in 2006, the Pac-10 &lt;U+2014&gt; alone among major conferences in doing so &lt;U+2014&gt; went to a full nine-game conference schedule. Previously, the schools did not play one non-rival opponent, resulting in an eight-game conference schedule (4 home games and 4 away). This round-robin schedule is only shared by the Big East among BCS conferences. The schedule consists of one home and away game against the two schools in each region, plus the game against the primary rival.

Rivalries in other sports
All of the intra-conference rivalries in football are carried over into other sports.
During the 1970s, UCLA and Notre Dame had an intense men's basketball rivalry. For several years, it was the only non-conference game in Division I basketball that was played twice a season (home-and-home). Unquestionably, the most famous game in the rivalry was on January 19, 1974, when Notre Dame scored the last 12 points of the game to nip UCLA and end the Bruins' record 88-game winning streak. This rivalry is now dormant, partly because Notre Dame is no longer independent in sports other than football (Big East).
In baseball, there are intense rivalries between the four southern schools. Arizona, Arizona State, USC, and UCLA have long and successful histories in baseball and all have won national titles in the sport. The most intense series is widely regarded to be the &quot;Basebrawl&quot; series between USC and Arizona State in 1990. Arizona State swept the series and in the final game a bench clearing brawl spread quickly to the stands and made national headlines. Several were injured and riot police were called to end the fracas.
Washington and California have a longstanding rivalry in men's crew as the two traditionally dominant programs on the West Coast.
The isolated rural campuses of Washington State and Idaho are eight miles (13 km) apart on the Palouse, creating a natural border war. Idaho rejoined FBS in 1996; the football rivalry has been dubbed Battle of the Palouse.
Due to the unique geographic nature of the Pac-10 teams, the teams travel in pairs for road basketball games. For example, on Thursday, February 28, 2008, USC played Arizona and UCLA played Arizona State. Two nights later the teams switched and USC played Arizona State and UCLA played Arizona. The teams are paired as followed: USC and UCLA (the L.A. teams), Arizona and Arizona State (the Arizona teams), Cal and Stanford (the Bay Area teams), Washington and Washington State (the Washington teams), and Oregon and Oregon State (the Oregon teams). Usually, the games are played on Thursdays and Saturdays with a game or occasionally two on Sundays for television purposes. This pairing formula is also used in women's volleyball. To make scheduling simpler for men and women's basketball (a sport in which each conference member uses a single venue for both teams' home games), the schedule for women's basketball is the opposite of the men's schedule. For example, when the Oregon schools are hosting the men's teams from the Arizona schools, the Arizona schools host the women's teams from Oregon schools the same weekend.
This formula has made a tradition in conference play to keep track of how a team does against a particular region; and stats are kept at to how successful a team is against, for example, &quot;the Bay Area schools&quot; at home or away. At any given week, four regions are playing against each other, while the remaining one has their rivalry game, usually on the weekend. Those teams get the Thursday off unless they schedule a non-conference game.

Lobos Meet Arizona for First Time in 10 Years. University of New Mexico Athletic Department, September 10, 2007. The Rifle: The two schools used to play for the Kit Carson rifle, although that custom was dropped many years ago. Kit Carson was a legendary scout in the territories of New Mexico and Arizona in the 1800s. The story goes that nearly 70 years ago former New Mexico director of athletics Roy Johnson and Arizona AD Pop McKale obtained a rifle in a trade with an Indian rumored to be Geronimo. It's not known what the administrators provided in return. McKale donated the rifle in 1938 and the score of each game was etched into the stock. The Lobos won 10 times, Arizona 21.↩
UA Sports UA Breakdown. Arizona Daily Star, September 15, 2007. Arizona and New Mexico will meet tonight for the first time since the 1997 Insight Bowl. That year, before the game was played, the presidents of the two universities decided to discontinue the Kit Carson Rifle trophy out of respect for both schools' Native American communities.↩
