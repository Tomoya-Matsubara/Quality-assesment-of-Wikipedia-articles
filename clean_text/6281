Lakeshore East is a master planned mixed use urban development being built in the Chicago Loop Loop Community areas of Chicago community area of Chicago in city-state Cook County Illinois, United States.  It is located in the northeastern part of the Loop, which along with Illinois Center is called the Chicago Loop#New Eastside New Eastside. The development is bordered by Wacker Drive to the north, Columbus Drive Chicago Columbus Drive to the west, Lake Shore Drive to the east, and East Randolph Street to the south. Skidmore, Owings and Merrill designed the master plan.cite web url=http://www.magellandevelopment.com/portfolio-current.html title=Portfolio accessdate=2008-05-26 publisher=magellan development date=2007  The development is scheduled for completion in 2011.cite web url=http://www.som.com/content.cfm/lakeshore_east_master_plan title=Lakeshore East Master Plan accessdate=2008-05-26 publisher=Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP  Although the majority of the buildings in the neighborhood will be 21st-century constructions resulting from the master plan, some of the current buildings were built as early as the 1960s and 1970s.  Thus, the term Lakeshore East refers only to the components of the new master plan, while the term New Eastside refers to the greater neighborhood surrounding Lakeshore East that extends westward to Michigan Avenue Chicago Michigan Avenue.cite web url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/zo/?id=100200 title=New Eastside accessdate=2008-06-10 publisher=Emporis.com  However, there is little distinction between buildings in the masterplan and other buildings in the region because the pre-existing buildings are referred to as being located in the Lakeshore East area.

The neighborhood features several of the List of tallest buildings in Chicago tallest buildings in Chicago and will include a few of the List of tallest buildings in the United States tallest buildings in the United States.  The overall planned development, the park and several of the individual buildings have won awards for architecture or urban planning.  The buildings are planned for various types of residential use condominiums, apartments, or hotels.  Due to the neighborhood's proximity to both Lake Michigan to the east and the Chicago River to the north, many of the buildings are named with aquatic or nautical themes.cite web url=http://www.chicagoarchitecture.info/Building/913/Aqua.php title=Aqua accessdate=2008-05-28 publisher=Artefaqs Corporation work=Chicago Architecture Info

Previous to this urban development, the Lakeshore East area had been used by Illinois Central Railroad rail yards yards.  After World War II, the railroads sold airspace rights north of Randolph Street.cite web url=http://www.asla.org/lamag/lam04/november/feature3.html title=Fair Game on Lake Michigan accessdate=2008-06-01 date=November 2004 publisher=American Society of Landscape Architects work=Landscape Architecture Magazine author=Freemen, Allen For several years after the rail yards were vacated, the site was used as a 9-hole golf course.  Pete Dye designed the course, known as Metro Golf at Illinois Center, which was completed in 1994 and closed in 2001.cite web url=http://thegolfcourses.net/golfcourses/IL/14535.htm title=Metro Golf at the Illinois Center semi-private accessdate=2008-05-30 publisher=Thegolfcourses.netcite web url=http://www.worldgolf.com/courses/usa/illinois/chicago/metro-golf-at-the-illinois-center-semi-private.html title=Metro Golf at the Illinois Center - Semi-Private accessdate=2008-05-30 publisher=WorldGolf.com The area was originally planned for development as part of the Illinois Center, and one of the challenges to the new development was to integrate itself into the inherited Multilevel streets in Chicago triple-level street system while creating a visually appealing and pedestrian friendly neighborhood.cite web url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-re-apt-lakeshore-east-0511may11,0,7571299.story title=Spacious rooms with views in Lakeshore East accessdate=2008-05-26 date=2008-05-11 publisher=Chicago Tribune author=Rosenberg, Janice The solution was to stagger ground-level amenities and building entrances from the upper level at the perimeter to the lower level at the interior. Thus the multilevel street grid is utilized around the edges, with large parking structures in the podiums, while a large park at the lowest level forms the core of the development.

The following buildings pre-existed the 21st century master plan for the neighborhood: Blue Cross Blue Shield Tower, Three Illinois Center, Swisstel Chicago, Buckingham Plaza, The Parkshore, North Harbor Tower, 400 East Randolph Street Condominiums and Harbor Point.  The Blue Cross Blue Shield Tower is currently undergoing a height addition.cite web url=http://midwest.construction.com/features/archive/0805_cover.asp title=Vertical Extension accessdate=2008-05-30 publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. work=McGraw-Hill Construction author=Barner, Craig date=May 2008  When Harbor Point and 400 East Randolph were built, Lake Shore Drive ran through this neighborhood to the west of these buildings, but it has since been rerouted to the east of these buildings.
