Criticism
The teachers of Crestwood High School have been accused, by students,11 of imposing socialist and/or unionist beliefs upon students, with the accounts of students recalling members of staff despising those of a conservative political background. It would appear that the higher administrative staff attempt to ensure that political correctness is upheld, with entire days planned to celebrate multiculturalism and respect. While it is true that Crestwood High is a multicultural school, with some 42% of attendees coming from a language background other than English12, some reports13 claim that those of South Asian descent feel disadvantaged within the school, with racial tensions remaining at an unsustainable level.
