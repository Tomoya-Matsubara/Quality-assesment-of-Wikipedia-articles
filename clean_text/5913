Monsters University is a 2013 American 3D computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures.1 It was directed by Dan Scanlon and produced by Kori Rae. It is the fourteenth feature film produced by Pixar and is a prequel to 2001's Monsters, Inc., marking the first time Pixar has made a prequel film.2
Plans for a second Monsters, Inc. film existed since 2005. Following disagreements between Disney CEO Michael Eisner and Pixar CEO Steve Jobs, Disney  which owned the rights to make sequels to all of Pixar's films up to Carsannounced that a sequel to Monsters, Inc. would be made by Circle 7 Animation, which was also working on an early draft of Toy Story 3.3 Screenwriters Rob Muir and Bob Hilgenberg were hired to write a script for the film, and storyboarded an early draft of it.4 However, Disney's change of management in late 2005in which Eisner was replaced by Robert Igerled to renewed negotiations with Pixar, and in early 2006 Disney announced it had purchased the studio. The Disney-owned sequel rights were then transferred to Pixar, leading to the cancellation of Muir and Hilgenberg's version of the film and the subsequent closure of Circle 7.5 A Pixar-made sequel was confirmed in 2010.6 The film was originally planned for release on November 16, 2012, but the release was preponed to November 2, 2012 to avoid competition with The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn{{spaced ndash}}Part 2. On April 5, 2011 it was announced that the film, the studio's fourteenth full-length feature, would be released on June 21, 2013.7 On May 29, 2011, it was confirmed that the film would be a prequel and the title Monsters University was announced.

The music for the film is composed by Randy Newman, marking his seventh collaboration with Pixar. Monsters University premiered on June 5, 2013 at the BFI Southbank in London, United Kingdom and was released on June 21, 2013, in the United States.

Plot
A young monster named Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Wazowski dreams of being a scarer (a monster who enters the human world at night to scare children so their screams can be harvested for energy) when he grows up, after visiting Monsters Inc.Monstropolis' most profitable and best-known scaring companyon a school field trip. Eleven years later, Mike is a scare major at Monsters University, where he meets his new roommate, Randall &quot;Randy&quot; Boggs, and a large, blue, furry monster named James P. &quot;Sulley&quot; Sullivan.1112
Mike studies hard, while the privileged Sulleywho comes from a talented family of scarersrelies on his natural scaring ability and begins to falter. At the final exam, Mike and Sulley's rivalry makes Dean Hardscrabble fail them both and drop them from the program, prompting Roar Omega Roar to remove Sulley from their team. Mike decides to prove himself by entering the Scare Games, but Oozma Kappathe only fraternity that was removed from the programis denied entry as they are one team member short. Seeing the competition as his ticket back into the scare program, Sulley joins and Mike reluctantly accepts.
Oozma Kappa fails the first challenge, an obstacle course where the contestants dodge harmful, glowing &quot;urchins,&quot; but miraculously advances when another team is disqualified for using protection gel, which violates the Scare Games' rules. The contestants attend Roar Omega Roar's party where the other competitors humiliate and discourage Oozma Kappa. Mike arranges a secret visit to Monsters, Inc. to lift their spirits, but Sulley still doubts that Mike can be a true scarer. Oozma Kappa places second in the following events. In the final round, they pull off a close victory cemented by a final decisive scare by Mike. Afterwards, Mike discovers that Sulley cheated to improve Mike's score. Determined to prove he is capable of becoming a scarer, Mike breaks into the school's door lab and enters a door to the human world, but the door leads to a summer camp and he is unable to scare a cabin full of children.
Back at the university, Sulley confesses to Hardscrabble that he cheated, just as she is notified of the break-in. Realizing what happened, Sulley enters the door to look for Mike. After finding and reconciling with him, they try to return but they find they are trapped in the human world because Hardscrabble has deactivated the door while waiting for the authorities to arrive. Mike realizes that the only way to get back into the monster world is to generate enough scream energy to power the door from their side. Working together, Sulley and Mike terrify the adults, generating an overwhelming amount of scream energy and allowing them to return to the lab.
Their actions lead to their expulsion from the university, but the other members of Oozma Kappa are accepted into the scare program the next semester because Hardscrabble is impressed with their performance in the games. They share goodbyes and as Sulley and Mike leave, Hardscrabble tells them they are the first to have surprised her and wishes them luck for the future. Mike and Sulley begin work at Monsters, Inc. in the company mailroom under the mailroom manager, the Abominable Snowman. Working their way up through the company, the two eventually become part of the Scarer Team, thus setting the events of Monsters, Inc. in motion.

Production
Plans for a second Monsters, Inc. film existed since 2005. Following disagreements between Disney CEO Michael Eisner and Pixar CEO Steve Jobs, Disney which owned the rights to make sequels to all of Pixar's films up to Carsannounced that a sequel to Monsters, Inc. would be made by Circle 7 Animation, which was also working on an early draft of Toy Story 3.40 Titled Monsters, Inc. 2: Lost in Scaradise, the film would have focused on Mike and Sulley visiting the human world to give Boo a birthday present, only to find that she had moved. After getting trapped in the human world, Mike and Sulley split up after disagreeing on what to do.41 Screenwriters Rob Muir and Bob Hilgenberg were hired to write a script for the film, and storyboarded an early draft of it.42 However, Disney's change of management in late 2005in which Eisner was replaced by Robert Igerled to renewed negotiations with Pixar, and in early 2006 Disney announced it had purchased the studio. The Disney-owned sequel rights were then transferred to Pixar, leading to the cancellation of Muir and Hilgenberg's version of the film and the subsequent closure of Circle 7.43
A Pixar-made sequel was confirmed in 2010.44 The film was originally planned for release on November 16, 2012, but the release was preponed to November 2, 2012 to avoid competition with The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn{{spaced ndash}}Part 2. On April 5, 2011 it was announced that the film, the studio's fourteenth full-length feature, would be released on June 21, 2013.45 On May 29, 2011, it was confirmed that the film would be a prequel and the title Monsters University was announced.
The feature was directed by Dan Scanlon and produced by Kori Rae.4647 Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Bob Peterson, and John Ratzenberger reprised their roles, and Bonnie Hunt voiced a new character. New voice cast included Dave Foley, Sean Hayes, Julia Sweeney, Helen Mirren, Alfred Molina, Peter Sohn, Charlie Day, Joel Murray, Nathan Fillion, Aubrey Plaza, Tyler Labine, John Kransinski, Bill Hader, Bobby Moynihan, and Beth Behrs.48 On August 12, 2011, Billy Crystal was asked about his return to the role of Mike Wazowski; he said, &quot;I'm a little hoarse. I spent five-and-a-half hours today for our fourth session on Monsters, Inc. 2.&quot;49
The plot of Monsters University details Mike and Sulley's first meeting, but this created a continuity error from the first film in which Mike tells Sulley that he has been jealous of his looks since the fourth grade. Director Dan Scanlon said he had a dilemma with this line during pre-production, but he believed it was best if Mike and Sulley meet in college because, &quot;we wanted to see their relationship develop when they were adults. And we also felt like college is so much about self-discovery and figuring out who you are.&quot; He added, &quot;It felt like the perfect place to do this, but we had that line. So we tried versions where they met young and then we skipped ahead to college. And we knew we didn't want to make Monsters Elementary.&quot; Scanlon said during pre-production that, &quot;Pete Docter, the original director, and John Lasseter ... finally said to me, 'it's great that you're honouring that, but you have to do what's right for the story.' So we made a tough decision to just have them be in college and put that line aside.&quot; Scanlon also said the line from the first film is, &quot;an old monster expression&quot; and &quot;That's what monsters always say to each other.&quot;505152
Monsters University is the first Pixar film that used global illumination, a new lighting system introduced as part of the overhaul of the rendering system used since the first Toy Story film. In the planning stage of the film, director of photography, Jean-Claude Kalache, asked &quot;What if we made these lights just work?&quot; Before the new system, artists had to build reflections and shadows manually, which became increasingly complex as the models and the setups became more technologically advanced. The new lighting system uses ray tracing, a technique that imitates the behaviour of the light in the real world; this automatized the process, delivered more realism, produced soft shadows, and let the artist spend more time on models and complex scenessome of which contained thousands of light sources.5354
For research, the filmmakers visited several colleges in the U.S., including Harvard University, Stanford University, and University of Alabama, observing college architecture, student life, Greek organizations, and the teaching methods of professors and faculty.555657 To research fraternity life, which is central to the film, many of the film's producers spent several weeks at a fraternity house.58

Track listing



Release
The first teaser trailer for Monsters University was released on , 2012.63 Four versions of the trailer exist; in his sleep, Mike mutters excuses to avoid attending class, such as &quot;I can't go to class, I'm not wearing any clothes,&quot; &quot;My homework ate my dog,&quot; &quot;Class President?&quot; and &quot;My pony made the Dean's List.&quot; A second trailer was released on February 11, 2013, a third on April 26, 2013, and a fourth and final trailer, which included scenes from the film, was released on May 30, 2013.
On October 8, 2012, Pixar revealed a fully functional website for Monsters University, complete with information about admissions, academic and campus life, and a campus store to purchase MU apparel. On April 1, 2013, the website was styled to appear as though a rival college, Fear Tech, had hacked and vandalized it.6465 The first television commercial for the film was aired during the 2013 Rose Bowl Game, parodying advertisements for participating schools that are shown during college football telecasts. From June 27 until July 11, 2013, Disney's online game Club Penguin hosted a Monsters University Takeover event to promote the film. Players could dress up as their favorite monsters and take part in the Scare Games.66
Monsters University had its worldwide premiere on June 5, 2013, as a special screening at BFI Southbank in London with the director and producer in attendance.67 The film had its Asian premiere as the opening film of the 2013 Shanghai International Film Festival on June 15, 2013.68 It premiered in the United States on June 8, 2013, at the Seattle International Film Festival,69 and was released in theaters on June 21, 2013.

Reception
Critical response
Monsters University has received mainly positive reviews from critics. The film has a 78% approval rating on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 174 reviews with an average rating of 6.8/10. According to that website's critical consensus, the film &quot;doesn't scale the heights of Pixar's finest efforts, but Monsters University is still funny and thoughtful family entertainment for viewers of any age.&quot;72 Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 65 based on 41 reviews.73
Matt Zoller Seitz of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four, saying it &quot;is true to the spirit of [Monsters Inc.] and matches its tone. But it never seems content to turn over old ground.&quot;74 Trevor Johnston of Time Out gave the film four stars out of five, writing, &quot;It has enough of the right stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz of its fluffy-furred cuteness has melted away. For a mere prequel, that's a result.&quot;75 Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A&lt;U+2212&gt;, and said it &quot;is exactly the rebound Pixar needed after 2011's Cars 2 left some wondering if the studio had lost its magic. The delightful story of when Mike met Sulley puts those concerns to rest.&quot;76 Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three stars out of four, and said it &quot;is cute, and funny, and the animation, though not exactly inspired, is certainly colorful.&quot;77 Jake Coyle of the Associated Press gave the film three stars out of four, saying it &quot;might not be as gifted as some of its other movies, but sometimes it's alright to be OK.&quot;78
Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three stars out of four, and said, &quot;It's all infectious fun, despite the lack of originality. In the art of tickling funny bones, Crystal and Goodman earn straight A's.&quot;79 Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review, saying, &quot;This minor film with major charms still deserves to have kids dragging their parents to the multiplex for one more peek at the monsters in the closet. With Pixar, familiarity breeds content.&quot;80
Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film three and a half stars out of five and said it is &quot;one of those movies that has absolutely no reason to exist, but once you've seen it, you're kind of glad it does.&quot;81 Alan Scherstuhl of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying, &quot;Monsters University feels not like the work of artists eager to express something but like that of likable pros whose existence depends on getting a rise out the kids. It's like the scares Sully and Mike spring on those sleeping tykes: technically impressive but a job un-anchored to anything more meaningful.&quot;82
Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three stars out of four, and said it &quot;may not be as inventive as Inc., but it's an amusing and amiable addition to Pixar's roster of animated coming-of-age stories.&quot;83 Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film three stars out of four, saying, &quot;It may be children&lt;U+2019&gt;s terror that powers the movie&lt;U+2019&gt;s fictional universe, but it&lt;U+2019&gt;s the energy of its stars that lights up Monsters University.&quot;84 James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three stars out of four, and wrote, &quot;Although it falls short of the best Pixar has brought to the screen over its long association with Disney, it's nevertheless worth a trip to the theater, especially for kids.&quot;85
The film was not without it detractors, though. Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, and said, &quot;This is not a bad movie, and to small children it will be a very good one, but it&lt;U+2019&gt;s closer to average than one would wish from the company that gave us Up, WALL-E, The Incredibles, and the Toy Story series.&quot;86 Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote, &quot;Both the originality and stirring emotional complexity of Monsters, Inc., with its exquisitely painful and touching parallels with the human world, are missing.&quot;87
Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, and said, &quot;The artwork is accomplished, and intricate. The G-rating is genuine, without any gross-out gags. And there's none of the usual winks to the adults with tired, pop-culture references.&quot;88 Richard Roeper gave the film two and a half stars out of five, saying &quot;This is a safe, predictable, edge-free, nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedges its bets.&quot;89 Leonard Maltin of IndieWire praised the animation and art direction, but wrote that he wished &quot;the movie was funnier and wasn't so plot-heavy&quot; and that &quot;Pixar has raised the bar for animated features so high that when they turn out a film that&lt;U+2019&gt;s merely good, instead of great, they have only themselves to blame for causing critics to damn them with faint praise.&quot;90
Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four, saying, &quot;Monsters University, the weirdly charmless sequel to the animated 2001 Pixar hit Monsters, Inc., is no better or worse than the average (and I mean average) time-filling sequel cranked out by other animation houses.&quot;91 Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald gave the film two stars out of five, and wrote that it &quot;feels half-hearted and lazy, like they weren't even trying. At least show a little effort, guys.&quot;92
Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, saying that it &quot;never surprises, goes off in unexpected directions or throws you for a loop in the manner of the best Pixar stories. Nor does it come close to elating through the sheer imagination of its conceits and storytelling.&quot;93
