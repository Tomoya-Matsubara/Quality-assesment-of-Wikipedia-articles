Poet in the City is a prominent London-based poetry charity, specialising in large-scale live events aimed at new audiences for poetry. Founded in 1998 as a project of the Poetry Society,1 it became an independent charity in 2006.2 Open to anyone, and free to join, it has a current membership of over 4,000 people and runs about 25 poetry events a year, mainly in central London, including about 12 events a year at Kings Place, an arts venue situated just north of King&lt;U+2019&gt;s Cross station.
Poet in the City is a venture philanthropy charity, building a bridge between the worlds of business and the world of the arts. It has developed a streamlined funding model in which most of the funds it raises are used to support its artistic outputs. Keeping its core costs very low by means of in-kind sponsorships and the use of new technology, the charity also benefits from the support of over 125 active volunteers. In April 2011, Poet in the City was offered National Portfolio Funding by Arts Council England, meaning that it will receive regular funding for a period of four years from 2012.
History
Poet in the City was founded in 1998 as a project of the Poetry Society,3 by Rosamund McCarthy, a lawyer at Bates, Wells &amp; Braithwaite LLP, It involved a number of City of London-based organisations, mainly law firms, in an annual fund-raising effort. Monies raised were used to deliver schools visits, placing poets in the classroom, and encouraging pupils to read and write poetry. Early successes included a John Donne event at the Chapter House of St Paul&lt;U+2019&gt;s and an open-air event on the steps of the Royal Exchange on National Poetry Day.
Governance
Poet in the City is managed by a board of trustees chaired by Renato Labi.4 Its Chief Executive is Isobel Colchester.5 She succeeded Graham Henderson, who was in post from July 2003 until March 2014.6

Every year Poet in the City launches National Poetry Day with a poetry power breakfast held in the City of London.

Many of the charity&lt;U+2019&gt;s supporters have come to it through these connections. The charity also regularly works with literary societies such as the Browning Society and Keats House.14
Poet in the City's New Audiences initiative, managed by a committee of the under-25s, specialises in providing platforms for some very contemporary poets, and connecting them with wider audiences. The charity has held programmes of events in partnership with several London-based universities including LSE, Imperial College, University College London, University of Roehampton and Goldsmiths.
Spoken Word All Stars
In 2010 Poet in the City produced its first national poetry tour, delivered in partnership with Apples and Snakes.15 Taking half a dozen of the UK&lt;U+2019&gt;s most accomplished spoken word artists, Kat Francois, Kate Tempest, El Crisis, Oneness and Chris Redmond (ventriloquist), accompanied by the jazz saxophonist Jason Yarde, the charity produced a new show designed to promote them and their work to new audiences all over the UK. Launched at Latitude in July 2010, the show appeared at a number of top venues all over the country during 2010 and 2011, including the Bluecoat in Liverpool, Contact in Manchester, Kings Place in London,16 MAC in Birmingham, Lakeside Arts Centre in Nottingham,17 the Pierhead in Cardiff, Theatre in the Mill in Bradford,18 and as part of the Bristol Spring Poetry Festival at the Arnolfini.19 The Tour was also the subject of a Sky Arts documentary.20

It has over 50 active volunteers who are involved in a range of activities from event management to marketing, film production to blogging and front of house.27
Schools work
Poet in the City has funded about 120 placements in primary and secondary schools.28 These have included specialised programmes designed to raise awareness of issues such as mental health, the natural environment and knife crime. The placements mainly take the form of 3&lt;U+2013&gt;5 day visits29 by poet educators, designed to encourage pupils to read and write poetry. In delivering these programmes the charity has worked in partnership with a number of other organisations, notably the Poetry Society, Samaritans, Lapidus and Learning Through the Arts. It has delivered schools programmes in Maria Fidelis School in Camden,30 one with the Spoken Word All Stars, and the other with the Cuban poet Milena Rodriguez.
In 2014 Poet in the City held a series of education workshops as part of a project with Archives for London called &quot;Through the Door&quot;. Seven leading UK poets, including Andrew Motion, Jo Shapcott, David Harsent and Imtiaz Dhaker were placed into London archives, resulting in newly commissioned poetry, live events and schools workshops.31
Educational work remains a strong commitment for the charity.32
International perspective
About 20% of Poet in the City events feature poets or poetry from around the world and the charity is committed to celebrating the great poetry cultures of the world. Current international partners include the Romanian Cultural Institute, the Instituto Cervantes,3334 and the Casa Fernando Pessoa. In 2009, thanks to a sponsorship from HSBC Bank, Poet in the City took Akerke Mussabekova, a young Kazakh poet, to Canada for a six-month residency, courtesy of the Vancouver Literary Festival and the Joy Kogawa House.35 In 2009&lt;U+2013&gt;10, with the support of the British Council, the charity delivered Words Converge, a text-based art installation created by Text/Gallery. The art work was displayed in the main atrium at Kings Place during the Kings Place Festival36 and later had separate emanations in Israel, Georgia and Romania.37
Rimbaud and Verlaine house
Poet in the City inherited a campaign to create an Anglo-French cultural centre at 8 Royal College Street in Camden, the house occupied by the French poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine38 during their celebrated and stormy sojourn in London in 1873. It played a leading role in the setting up of a new charity, the Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation, to take this initiative forward.
