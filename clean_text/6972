Ulum&lt;U+0101&gt;heihei Hoapili (c. 1776&lt;U+2013&gt;1840) was a member of the nobility during the formation of the Kingdom of Hawaii. He was a trusted military and political advisor to King Kamehameha I, known as &quot;Kamehameha the Great&quot;. Although trusted with one of the last symbolic rites of the Hawaiian religion, he later became a supporter of Christian missionaries.
Life
Ulum&lt;U+0101&gt;heihei (his original name) was born around 1776. His father was High Chief Kameeiamoku, known as one of the &quot;royal twins&quot; who helped Kamehameha I come to power.1 In his youth he was athletic, standing about  tall. A story was told of how he once wrestled down an attacking bull by its horns.2 A few years after the 1795 battle of Nuuanu when Kamehameha conquered Oahu and Maui, Hoapili was left in charge of the island of Oahu and the royal court settled at Kamakahonu in present-day Kailua-Kona. His first marriage was to Chiefess Kalilikauoha (daughter of King Kahekili of Maui). From her his daughter Kuini Liliha was born around 1802, about the same time his father Kameeiamoku died.3 In 1810 the King of the island of Kauai agreed to become a vassal, and Kamehameha had united all the Hawaiian islands.
By 1815, Kamehameha had established succession with two sons, and entrusted Ulum&lt;U+0101&gt;heihei with the care of their mother Queen Ke&lt;U+014D&gt;p&lt;U+016B&gt;olani, Kamehameha's wife with the best royal family background. This made Hoapili step-father to Princess N&lt;U+0101&gt;hienaena.4 He became known as hoa pili which means &quot;close personal friend&quot; in the Hawaiian language because of his trusted relationship with Kamehameha.5 A saying of the time was O Ulu-maheihei wale no, ia ia oloko, ia ia owaho, meaning roughly &quot;Ulum&lt;U+0101&gt;heihei knows everything inside and out.&quot;6
Hoapili was with Kamehameha when he died on May 8, 1819 at Kamakahonu. The dying king whispered his last wishes into Hoapili's ear.7 He and his half-brother Hoolulu were selected to hide the bones of Kamehameha in a secret place, according to ancient rituals.8 To add to the secrecy, they waited for a night of a new moon. Theories are a cave was found along the shore that was covered at high tides, in the area known as Kaloko.9 This would be the last monarch of Hawaii to have all the traditional funeral rites of the Hawaiian religion.
When his nephew Keaoua Kekuaokalani organized an uprising, Hoapili was sent with chief orator Naihe to negotiate a peaceful settlement. Kekuaokalani refused, so Hoapii and military leader Kalanimoku led Kingdom troops to the battle of Kuamoo where the rebels were routed.10 Another brief uprising in the northern part of the island near Waimea also had to be suppressed with troops lead by Hoapili.11
In 1820 the first company of Christian missionaries arrived. Although Kamehameha II was officially King, real power was held by his half-cousin Queen Kaahumanu who welcomed them. On April 11, 1822, some translators from Tahiti arrived with English missionary William Ellis. The Hawaiian language was close enough to Tahitian that the pace of education improved. In February 1823, Ke&lt;U+014D&gt;p&lt;U+016B&gt;olani renounced the practice of multiple spouses for royalty, and made Hoapili her only husband. Previously she had been &quot;shared&quot; with another former Kamehameha military leader, Kalanim&lt;U+014D&gt;k&lt;U+016B&gt;. On April 23, 1823, William Richards and Charles Stewart would arrive in the second company of missionaries and teach reading and writing.12
Hoapili served as Royal Governor of Maui from May 1823 until his death. In March he and Ke&lt;U+014D&gt;p&lt;U+016B&gt;olani moved to Lahaina, and asked for books and a chaplain so they could continue their studies.13 Ke&lt;U+014D&gt;p&lt;U+016B&gt;olani died September 16, 1823 after being a baptism by Ellis. Her funeral was a mix of Hawaiian and Christian traditions.14 
On October 19, 1823 Hoapili married Kal&lt;U+0101&gt;kua Kaheiheim&lt;U+0101&gt;lie (c. 1780&lt;U+2013&gt;1842) who became known as &quot;Hoapili-wahine&quot;, roughly meaning &quot;Mrs. Hoapili&quot;. It was the first Christian weding ceremony for Hawaiian nobility.15 Hoapili would then often be known as &quot;Hoapili-kane&quot; (&quot;Mr. Hoapili&quot;) to distinguish the two. This made him step-father to Miriam Auhea Kek&lt;U+0101&gt;uluohi, who was Queen Consort of two kings and mother of another.16 They adopted and helped raise Prince Lot Kapu&lt;U+0101&gt;iwa (Kal&lt;U+0101&gt;kua's grandson, who would later be known as King Kamehameha V) in the Hawaiian tradition known as hanai.17
In August 1824, he led troops from Maui to supress an uprising by &quot;George Prince&quot; Kaumualii on Kauai.18 During the 1820s, Lahaina became a popular port for whaling ships. This led to conflicts between the sailors who liked to enjoy their time ashore with grog and women, and the conservative missionaries. Hoapili ordered cannon to defend the town after an irate captain of the English whaler John Palmer had opened fire on the mission station.19
By 1826, he ruled that all marriages on Maui should follow the Christian tradition.20 After the thatched house used as a church blew down, in 1828 he ordered the first stone church to be built adjacent to Mokuula which was a royal residence and burial site on a small island within a sacred pond.21
His daughter Kuini Liliha married High Chief Boki, and inherited Boki's position of Royal Governor of Oahu after Boki's disappearance at sea in 1829. Liliha was suspected of organizing a rebellion in 1830, and Hoapili was sent to peacefully relieve her of her duties. In 1831 he donated land to be used for the Lanhainaluna seminary founded by Lorrin Andrews. This school would produce some of the important historians of the time, such as Samuel Kamakau and David Malo. Hoapili was consulted as an expert in astronomy and ancient Hawaiian mythology for the first book published on Hawaiian history. Hoapili selected a promising assistant to become educated as a teacher for Hawaii island.22
As more companies of missionaries arrived, Hoapili awarded additional grants of land, sometimes to the consternation of the people who lived there. Dwight Baldwin arrived in 1836, and would help Hoapili deal with the health problems of alcoholism and epidemic diseases carried on the whaling ships.23 Hoapili died January 3, 1840, and was buried at Waiola Church cemetery, then known as &quot;Wainee Church&quot;.24
Legacy
The Girls' dormitory at Lahainaluna High School (at the site of the Lanhainaluna seminary) was named for him.25 The area where he lived on Oahu was given to his daughter Liliha and son-in-law Boki. It was then donated to the mission and became home of the Punahou School in 1841.2627 Historian Sheldon Dibble called Hoapili &quot;a meek and quiet disciple of Jesus and a firm supporter of the Christian Religion&quot;.28
