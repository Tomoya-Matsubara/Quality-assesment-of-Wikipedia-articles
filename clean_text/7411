The Drew School District is a public school district based in Drew, Mississippi (USA).1 The school district's attendance boundary includes Drew, Rome, and the employee residences of the Mississippi State Penitentiary (Parchman), located in an unincorporated area.
History

In 1967 civil rights activist Mae Bertha Carter and Marian Wright Edelman, a lawyer who worked for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., sued the Drew School District to challenge the Mississippi &quot;freedom of choice&quot; law. In 1969 the plaintiffs won the suit.2
After Drew School District was desegregated, White residents of Drew enrolled their children in North Sunflower Academy.3
Billy Turner of The Times-Picayune said that Drew High School had few markers that Archie Manning, a famous American football player from Drew, had attended school there.4
In 2011 the State of Mississippi took over the Drew School District. In February 2012 the Mississippi Senate voted 43-4 to pass Senate Bill 2330, to consolidate the Drew School District, the Indianola School District, and the Sunflower County School District into one school district. The bill went to the Mississippi House of Representatives.5 Later that month, the State Board of Education approved the consolidation of the Drew School District and the Sunflower County School District, and if Senate Bill 2330 is approved, Indianola School District will be added.6
Schools
The district's schools are Drew Hunter High School and A.W. James Elementary School.7 Prior to the 2010-2011 school year the school district had three school buildings, including A.W. James Elementary School, Hunter Middle School, and Drew High School. James served K-4, Hunter served 5-8, and Drew High served 9-12.8 In 2010 the school district voted to close the Drew High School building and move the 5th and 6th grades to A.W. James. John Thigpen, the president of the school board, stated that the district operated as if it had 1,200 students when in fact it had 650.9 Effective August 1, 2011, all students will be required to wear school uniforms.10
