The word orange is both a noun and an adjective in the English language. In both cases, it refers primarily to the orange fruit and the colour orange, but has many other derivative meanings.
The word derives from a Dravidian language, and it passed through numerous other languages including Sanskrit and Old French before reaching the English language. The earliest uses of the word in English refer to the fruit, and the colour was later named after the fruit. Before the English-speaking world was exposed to the fruit, the colour was referred to as geoluhread (yellow-red) in Old English and Middle English.1
It is widely claimed that the word orange has no true rhyme. There are, however, half rhymes or near-rhymes, as well as some proper nouns that rhyme with it. This lack of rhymes has inspired many humorous poems and songs.
Etymology
The word orange entered Middle English from Old French and Anglo-Norman orenge.2 The earliest recorded use of the word in English is from the 13th century and referred to the fruit. The earliest attested use of the word in reference to the colour is from the 16th century.3 It is generally thought that Old French borrowed the Italian melarancio (&quot;fruit of the orange tree&quot;, with mela &quot;fruit&quot;) as pume orenge (with pume &quot;fruit&quot;).45 Although pume orenge is attested earlier than melarancio in available written sources, lexicographers believe that the Italian word is actually older.6 The word ultimately derives from a Dravidian language&lt;U+2014&gt;possibly Telugu &lt;U+0C28&gt;&lt;U+0C3E&gt;&lt;U+0C30&gt;&lt;U+0C3F&gt;&lt;U+0C19&gt;&lt;U+200C&gt; naarinja or Malayalam &lt;U+0D28&gt;&lt;U+0D3E&gt;&lt;U+0D30&gt;&lt;U+0D19&gt;&lt;U+0D4D&gt;&lt;U+0D19&gt;&lt;U+200C&gt; naaranga or Tamil &lt;U+0BA8&gt;&lt;U+0BBE&gt;&lt;U+0BB0&gt;&lt;U+0BAE&gt;&lt;U+0BCD&gt; n&lt;U+0101&gt;ram&lt;U+2014&gt;via Sanskrit  &quot;orange tree&quot;, with borrowings through Persian &lt;U+0646&gt;&lt;U+0627&gt;&lt;U+0631&gt;&lt;U+0646&gt;&lt;U+06AF&gt; n&lt;U+0101&gt;rang and Arabic &lt;U+0646&gt;&lt;U+0627&gt;&lt;U+0631&gt;&lt;U+0646&gt;&lt;U+062C&gt; n&lt;U+0101&gt;ranj.
The place name Orange has a separate etymology. The Roman-Celtic settlement was founded in 36 or 35 BCE and originally named Arausio, after a Celtic water god.7 The Principality of Orange was named for this place and not for the colour. Some time after the sixteenth century, though, the colour orange was adopted as a symbol of the House of Orange-Nassau.8 The colour eventually came to be associated with Protestantism, due to participation by the House of Orange on the Protestant side in the French Wars of Religion and the Dutch Eighty Years' War.9
Rhyme

It is widely accepted that no single English word is a true rhyme for orange, though there are half rhymes such as hinge, lozenge, syringe, flange, Stonehenge, or porridge.10 Despite the fact that this property is not unique to the word one study of 5,411 one-syllable English words found 80 words with no rhymes11 the lack of rhyme for orange has garnered significant attention, and inspired many humorous verses.
Although sporange, a variant of sporangium, is an eye rhyme for orange, it is not a true rhyme as its second syllable is pronounced with an unreduced vowel , and often stressed.
There are a number of proper nouns which rhyme or nearly rhyme with orange, including The Blorenge, a mountain in Wales, and Gorringe, a surname. US Naval Commander Henry Honychurch Gorringe, the captain of the USS Gettysburg who discovered Gorringe Ridge in 1875,12 led Arthur Guiterman to quip in &quot;Local Note&quot;:


In Sparkill buried lies that man of mark

Who brought the Obelisk to Central Park,

Redoubtable Commander H.H. Gorringe,

Whose name supplies the long-sought rhyme for &quot;orange.&quot;13


Compound words or phrases may give true or near rhymes in some accents. Examples include door-hinge, torn hinge, or inch, and a wrench. William Shepard Walsh attributes this verse featuring two multiple-word rhymes for orange to W.W. Skeat.


''I gave my darling child a lemon,

''That lately grew its fragrant stem on;

''And next, to give her pleasure more range,

''I offered her a juicy orange.

''And nuts, she cracked them in the door-hinge.14


Enjambment can also provide for rhymes. One example is Willard Espy's poem, &quot;The Unrhymable Word: Orange&quot;.


The four eng-

ineers

Wore orange

brassieres.15


Another example by Tom Lehrer relies on the way many Americans pronounce orange as /&lt;U+0251&gt;r&lt;U+0259&gt;nd&lt;U+0292&gt;/, as opposed to /or&lt;U+0259&gt;nd&lt;U+0292&gt;/:


Eating an orange

While making love

Makes for bizarre enj-

oyment thereof.16


Nonce words are sometimes contrived to rhyme with orange. Composers Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel wrote the song &quot;Oranges Poranges&quot; to be sung by the Witchiepoo character on the television programme H.R. Pufnstuf.


Oranges poranges, who says,

'' oranges poranges, who says,''

oranges poranges, who says?

there ain't no rhyme for oranges!17
