Tirana () is the capital and the largest city of Albania. Modern Tirana was founded in 1614 by Sulejman Pasha. Tirana became Albania's capital city in 1920.
The Municipality of Tirana lies on the river Ish&lt;U+00EB&gt;m, about  inland and is located at (41.33&lt;U+00B0&gt;N, 19.82&lt;U+00B0&gt;E) in Tirana District, Tirana County. Tirana's average altitude is  above sea level and its highest point measures  at Mali me Gropa. The city is on the same parallel as Naples, Madrid and Istanbul and on the same meridian as Budapest and Krakow. In addition to Ish&lt;U+00EB&gt;m, the Tiran&lt;U+00EB&gt; river also runs through the city, whereas the Lan&lt;U+00EB&gt; river, running through much of the city, is a brook. The city also contains a total of four artificial lakes: Tirana Lake, Kod&lt;U+00EB&gt;r-Kam&lt;U+00EB&gt;z Lake, Farka Lake, and Tufina Lake.
History
Antiquity
The area now occupied by the city of Tirana has been populated since Paleolithic times1 dating back 10,000 to 30,000 years ago, as evidence by tools that were found near Mount Dajt's quarry terrain, as well as inside the Cave of the Pellumba. Tirana's precincts are some of the earliest regions in Albania to be inhabited. Various remains discovered in fortresses, churches, villages, and during urban constructions in and around Tirana provide evidence for continuous activity throughout much of human history. The oldest discovery in the area of Tirana was a mosaic with several other remains, found at the Fountain of Shengjin near a medieval temple. A castle, possibly called Tirkan, was built by Emperor Justinian in 520 AD and restored by Ahmed Pasha Toptani in the 18th century. The area had no special importance in Illyrian and classical times. In 1418, Marin Barleti, an Albanian Catholic priest and scholar, referred to this area as a small village.
Ottoman rule
 The records of the first land registrations under the Ottomans in 1431-32 show that Tirana consisted of 60 inhabited areas, with nearly 2,028 houses and 7,300 inhabitants. The 1583 census records show that Tirana had 110 inhabited areas, with 2,900 houses and 20,000 inhabitants. S&lt;U+00FC&gt;leiman Pasha Mulleti (or Sulejman Pash&lt;U+00EB&gt; Bargjini), a local ruler, established the Ottoman town in 1614 with a mosque, a commercial centre and a hammam (Turkish sauna). The town was located along caravan routes and grew rapidly in importance until the early 19th century.
During this period, the mosque in the centre of Tirana, the Et'hem Bey Mosque designed by Molla Bey of Petrela, began to be constructed. It employed the best artisans in the country and was completed in 1821 by Molla's son, who was also Sulejman Pasha's grandnephew. In 1800, the first new comers arrived in the settlement, the so-called ortodoksit. They were Vlachs from villages of Kor&lt;U+00E7&gt;&lt;U+00EB&gt; and Pogradec who settled around the area of today's Artificial Lake of Tirana.2 Later, they started to be known as the llacifac and were the first Christians to arrive after the foundation of the town. In 1807, Tirana became the center of the Sub-Prefecture of Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt;-Tirana. After 1816, Tirana languished under the control of the Toptani family of Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt;. In 1865, Tirana became a Sub-Prefecture of the newly created Vilayet of Shkod&lt;U+00EB&gt;r and Sanjak of Durr&lt;U+00EB&gt;s. The Albanian language started to be taught in Tirana's schools in 1889. The patriotic club &quot;Bashkimi&quot; was founded in 1908 while on 28. November 1912, the national flag was raised in agreement with Ismail Qemali. During the Balkan Wars, the town was temporarily occupied by the Serbian army, and in 1914-15, it took part in uprising of the villages lead by Haxhi Qamili.
Capital city
 On February 8, 1920, Tirana was chosen as the temporary capital of Albania, which had acquired independence in 1912, by the Congress of Lushnja. The city retained that status permanently on December 31, 1925. From 1920 to 1924 Tirana experienced attacks from the army of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and the forces of Zogu at the Shkalla e Tujanit (Step of Tujan). The first regulatory plan of the city was compiled in 1923 by Eshref Frash&lt;U+00EB&gt;ri, and completed by the Geographic Institute of Florence.3 Durr&lt;U+00EB&gt;s Street was opened in 1922 and called Nana Mbretnesh&lt;U+00EB&gt; (Mother Queen). Many houses and surrounding properties were demolished to make way for it. In 1924, Tirana was the center of the Revolution of June lead by Fan S. Noli. Since 1925, when they were banned in Turkey, the Bektashis, an order of dervishes who take their name from Haji Bektash, a Sufi saint of the 13th and 14th centuries, made Tirana their primary settlement. The city was the venue where the Pact of Tirana was signed. The existing parliamentary building was raised in 1924 and first served as a club for officers. It was there, in September 1928, that King Zog I was crowned King.
Monarchy and war
 The center of Tirana was the project of Florestano de Fausto and Armando Brasini, well known architects of the Benito Mussolini period in Italy. The Royal Palace (Palace of the Brigades), the Town Hall, the government ministry buildings, and the National Bank are their work. D&lt;U+00EB&gt;shmor&lt;U+00EB&gt;t e Kombit (National Martyrs) Boulevard was built in 1930 and named &quot;Zogu I Boulevard&quot;. In the communist period, the part from Skanderbeg Square up to the train station was named &quot;Stalin Boulevard&quot;. In 1939, Tirana was captured by Fascist forces. In November 1941, Enver Hoxha with other Albanian communists founded the Communist Party of Albania. The town became the center of the Albanian communists' in mobilizing the people of Tirana to fight against the Italian fascists and later Nazi Germans, while spreading ideological propaganda. The town was liberated after a fierce battle between the Communists and the people of Tirana against the German forces, on November 17, 1944. The Nazis eventually withdrew and the communists seized power.
Under communist rule
 Following the communist takeover, the city experienced a significant period of development. In terms of urbanization, the city witnessed the creation of socialist-styled apartment complexes and factories. In the 1960s, the historical identity of the city faced a critical moment as the central square was redesigned. As a result, a number of buildings of cultural and historical significance were demolished to make way for the formation of present-day Skanderbeg Square. The Old Bazaar used to be located near the modern Palace of Culture. The National Historic Museum was built on the grounds of the former building of the Municipality of Tirana, which was destroyed in the 1960s. The building that used to house the Parliament of Albania during King Zog's reign was turned into a children's theater and named the Dolls Theater.
Politically, a number of high-profile figures visited the city. In 1959, Soviet president Nikita Khruschev came to Tirana, and he laid the first brick on the foundations for the new Palace of Culture. In 1964, the Premier of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, met with Enver Hoxha. In 1985, Tirana served as the venue for the ceremonies after Hoxha's death. Four years later, Oskar Fischer, Minister for Foreign Matters of the German Democratic Republic, visited Tirana.
Transition period
The post communist period is described to have been the worst one in terms of the urban development of the city. Tirana experienced a chaotic development as high rise buildings started to be constructed without planning, and illegal structures rose on public areas. New informal districts started to form around the city as internal migrants gathered from around the country. During this period Tirana was transofrmed from a centrally planned economy to a market oriented economy. All the builidings and the apartaments were denationalized. A modern water-supply system and electrical-supply system was build during 1992-1996. These systems form the backbone of the modern Tirana.
Rebirth
 The city experienced radical changes at the turn of the millennium. In 2000, a massive political campaign began to beautify and to liberate public space, which was previously occupied by illegal commercial establishments. The campaign, called Return to Identity, included the transformation of river banks, of parks, and of other public structures to their state before 1990. The overall infrastructure has improved as considerable number of roads have been reconstructed. More parks and squares have also been built giving Tirana a more &quot;European&quot; look. Common spaces between apartment buildings have been targeted by a subsequent campaign in bringing back green spaces and a vast number of illegal buildings have been demolished. It is observered that some existing green spaces are used for the construction of skyscrapers and multi-functional centers. Apartment buildings are being built on grounds of former residential houses. Tirana's mayor, Edi Rama, has led an initiative to paint the fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ades of Tirana's buildings in bright colours, although interiors of those building are still falling into ruins.45
There are future regulatory and building plans for Tirana. Some of them include: Skanderbeg's Square Rehabilitation, The Zone of the Lake, Priority Zone &quot;E&quot;, etc. Tirana has still a lot of problems. A lot of tall buildings have been built during 2000-2010 without any plan and there's still no urban plan for the entire city.
Climate
Tirana has a typical Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters.

Demographics
As of 2008, the city's urban population was officially estimated at 618,431. In 1703, Tirana had about 4,000 inhabitants and by 1820 the number tripled to 12,000. The first census, conducted in 1923 (a few years after Tirana became capital city of Albania) showed a total population of 10,845. During the 1950s, Tirana experienced rapid industrial growth, and the population increased to about 137,000 by 1960. After the end of communist rule in 1991, Tirana experienced its fastest population growth as people from rural areas moved to the capital in search of a better life. In 1990, Tirana had 250,000 inhabitants, but the large-scale influx since then from other parts of the country has increased the population to well over 600,000.

Districts

The Municipality of Tirana is divided into 11 smaller administrative units referred to as Nj&lt;U+00EB&gt;si Bashkiake (Municipal Units). These are made up of their own mayor and council, and sometimes are also known as Mini-Bashki (Mini-Municipality).
In 2000, the centre of Tirana, from the central campus of Tirana University up to Skanderbeg Square was declared the place of Cultural Assembly, and given special claims to state protection. In the same year, the area began a process of restoration under the name &lt;U+2018&gt;Return to Identity&lt;U+2019&gt;. The area to the west of the university, adjacent to Sh&lt;U+00EB&gt;n Prokopi Park, was formerly reserved for the occupation of important government and party officials. It remains a desirable residential area.
Economy
Tirana is Albania's major industrial centre. It has experienced rapid growth and established many new industries since the 1920s. The principal industries include agricultural products and machinery, textiles, pharmaceuticals, and metal products.
Tirana began to develop in the beginning of the 16th century, when a bazaar was established, and its craftsmen manufactured silk and cotton fabrics, leather, ceramics and iron, silver, and gold artifacts. Sited in a fertile plain, the Tirana area exported 2,600 barrels of olive oil and 14,000 packages of tobacco to Venice by 1769. In 1901, it had 140,000 olive trees, 400 oil mills, and 700 shops. The TID tower at 85 meters is being constructed in the city. It will redefine architecture in Albania.Tirana has also huge trade centers like City Park at 3 km square.
Environment
 The city suffers from problems related to overpopulation, such as waste management, lack of running water and electricity as well as extremely high levels of air pollution from the 300,000 cars moving around the city. The problem is exacerbated by aging infrastructure. Despite the problems, Tirana has also experienced a very rapid growth in the construction of new buildings.9 In recent years pollution has worsened as the number of cars has increased by several orders of magnitude. These are mostly older, diesel cars that pollute much more than the newer models in circulation elsewhere in Europe. Additionally, most of the fuel used in Albania contains larger amounts of sulfur and lead than that allowed in European Union countries. In recent years pollution from construction has become a major concern for the inhabitants of the city. Another peril to the city comes from untreated solid waste. The National Park (former Saint Prokopius Park), a vast forested park in the outskirts of the city, has some effect on absorbing CO2 emissions. Tirana is cleaned by government workers everyday, and trees have been planted around many sidewalks. Mayor Edi Rama has promised that he will plant 100,000 more trees in Tirana. He has claimed that by 2012-2014 Tirana will have the cleanest air in the Balkans. This will increase Albania's life expectancy. So far over 2000 trees have been planted.
Media
Tirana is the media hub of Albania. The city is home to the headquarters of the Albanian Radio and Television (RTSH), Albania's public broadcaster, and national commercial broadcasters such as Top Channel and TV Klan. Numerous radio stations operate in the capital, the most notable being Radio Tirana, followed by commercial Top Albania Radio and Plus 2 Radio. Tirana is home to the publication of a vast number of dailies: Shqip, Z&lt;U+00EB&gt;ri i Popullit, Shekulli, Gazeta Shqiptare and Koha Jon&lt;U+00EB&gt; being the most famous.

Sports

Tirana is the major centre for sport in Albania and Tirana's football clubs have won more championships than any other clubs in Albania. Tirana has two stadiums, the Qemal Stafa Stadium, that holds around 20,000 spectators and the Selman St&lt;U+00EB&gt;rmasi stadium which holds around 12,000 spectators. The Tirana sportive infrastructure is developing fast because of Municipality and MTKRS investments. From 2007 Tirana Municipality has build up to 80 sport gardens in most of Tirana neighbourhoods.
Transport
Municipal, national and international transport links have developed over recent years as demand has increased. Until recent years, overland connections through Greece and Montenegro have had various problems with bureaucracy or security. The city serves as the meeting point for national roads SH1, SH2 and SH3. Tirana is yet to build a ring road that would drastically reduce traffic in the city. The following section is liable to change and is only indicative.
Bus
Local transport within Tirana is by bus or taxi. Group taxis (known as 'furgons') running multiple passengers operate on many pre-determined but unofficial routes and departure times are dictated by when sufficient passenger numbers justufy running costs. Coach and minibus services also run, again according to demand, to the coast and northern and southern Albania from different locations in Tirana. International coach services connect to Greece, via Kor&lt;U+00E7&gt;&lt;U+00EB&gt; or Kakavije, to Kosovo via the new Durres-Morine highway, and to the Republic of Macedonia via Struge.
Rail

There are regular passenger services to Durr&lt;U+00EB&gt;s and Pogradec, via Elbasan. The railway station is north of Skanderbeg Square, in Boulevard Zogu I. There are no international passenger services, although there is a freight-only railway through Shkod&lt;U+00EB&gt;r to Montenegro (though this is currently disused).
Air
Tirana International Airport Mother Theresa (N&lt;U+00EB&gt;n&lt;U+00EB&gt; Tereza in Albanian), also known as Rinas Airport, was reconstructed in 2007. It is located 15 kilometres northwest of the city, off the road to Durr&lt;U+00EB&gt;s. Airlines using Rinas include Albanian Airlines. Flights run to Athens, London, Rimini, Bari, Genoa, Rome, Bologna, Munich, Frankfurt, Istanbul, Vienna among other places. It is one of the biggest airports in the region. Several foreign airlines also serve Rinas Airport: Alitalia (from Rome and Milan), British Airways (from London Gatwick Airport), Austrian Airlines (from Vienna), Adria Airways (Ljubljana), Jat Airways (Belgrade), Malev (Budapest), Olympic Air (Athens), Hemus Air (Sofia) and Turkish Airlines (Istanbul). In summer there is a direct charter flight from JFK, New York.
Sea
Tirana is served by the port of Durr&lt;U+00EB&gt;s, that is 36 km distant from the capital. Passenger ferries from Durr&lt;U+00EB&gt;s sail to Trieste, Ancona, Otranto, Brindisi, Bari, Lecce, Genoa (Italy), Zadar, Dubrovnik (Croatia), Maribor, Koper (Slovenia), Gdansk (Poland), Bar (Montenegro), Corfu (Greece) and others.
