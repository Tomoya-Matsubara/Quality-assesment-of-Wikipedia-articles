Samuel &quot;Sam&quot; Babson Fuld (born November 20, 1981) is an American professional baseball outfielder with the Tampa Bay Rays of Major League Baseball.1
Despite being diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 10, Fuld began his baseball career by twice batting .600 in high school, during which time Baseball America ranked him 19th in the country.2 He then played college baseball at Stanford, where he was an All American, set the school record for career runs scored, and set the College World Series record for career hits.3
Fuld was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in 2004. He was an All Star two years later in the Florida State League. A year after that, he was voted the Most Valuable Player in the Arizona Fall League.45
Fuld made his major league debut with the Cubs in 2007. He became a fan favorite for his acrobatic defense.6 After the 2010 season, he was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays.7
Personal life
Fuld, who is Jewish,89 is the son of Kenneth Fuld, the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Professor of Psychology at the University of New Hampshire, and Amanda Merrill, a New Hampshire State Senator.10111213 He is also a second cousin of former Lehman Brothers CEO Dick Fuld.14
He got his start playing baseball hitting wiffle balls with his grandmother when he was three years old.1516 Instead of carrying around the typical teddy bear or worn-down baby blanket when he was young, he carried a book of baseball stats with him all the time, like a security blanket.17 &quot;He was only 5 or 6 and he was already computing batting averages and ERAs,&quot; his father said. &quot;He'd sit in the bathtub, and I'd say 'If a guy goes 17-for-37, what's his batting average?' What struck me is that he'd perform these operations in very creative ways&lt;U+2013&gt;not just that he got the right answer, but his methodology, adding in a factor and then dividing by 10, etc. I'd watch him and say 'wow,' just like I said 'wow' when he used to hit.&quot;18
Shorter than most major leaguers, Fuld says: &quot;When I realized I was going to be limited physically, I looked for guys in the big leagues who were little. I'd buy baseball cards and find anyone under 5&lt;U+2013&gt;10 who played in the outfield, and say, 'That's my guy; there's hope.'&quot;19 Despite his size, by the time he was 12 years old, Fuld was competing in a league of 14- to 16-year-olds.
In June 2009, Fuld married his high school sweetheart, Sarah. He had met her while they were fellow students at Phillips Exeter Academy.20 She is an athlete as well, and won two national lacrosse championships playing for Princeton University.21
Diabetes

Fuld was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when he was 10 years old. He recalled, &quot;I was losing weight, I was thirsty all the time, just classic symptoms, so my parents knew something was wrong and the doctor diagnosed it right away. It was tough, but when I realized there was no other alternative, I just looked at it as a challenge.&quot;22
At the age of 12, he met pitcher Bill Gullickson, who also had diabetes, and talked to him for two minutes. &quot;That was enough to inspire me,&quot; Fuld said.23 &quot;Any time I can talk to young diabetic kids, I look forward to that opportunity,&quot; said Gullickson.24
Former Cub All Star third baseman Ron Santo was also afflicted with Type 1 diabetes. Santo hid his ailment from others during his playing days, because he was afraid they would consider him weak.25 Santo later had both his legs amputated, because of complications caused by his diabetes.26
Now, at least six times a day Fuld opens a small black case, withdraws a glucometer, pricks a finger (&quot;It's pretty painless; I've got calloused fingers&quot;), and checks his blood sugar (a 30-second process).2728 He does it whenever he feels he should check his blood sugar level, even if he is in the clubhouse or the dugout.29 He gives himself shots of insulin at breakfast and dinner times.3031
Fuld is also comfortable handling the kidding in the clubhouse regarding his treatments. &quot;We dish it out pretty good about his insulin shots,&lt;U+201D&gt; said his AA manager Pat Listach. &quot;We always give him stuff about putting needles in the refrigerator, and shooting up in the clubhouse. He takes it all in stride. He&lt;U+2019&gt;s a good guy.&quot;32
Asked whether he thinks about his blood sugar level when he is chasing fly balls, he answered: &quot;For those brief moments, it's out of my mind. I get back to the dugout, and it definitely crosses my mind. 'OK, my face is intact &lt;U+2013&gt; what about my sugar?'&quot;33
Baseball career
High school
Fuld attended Berwick Academy as an eighth grader, during which time the University of New Hampshire's baseball coach opined that he had the best batting swing of any player in the State. He then transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy, where he played baseball and soccer, and ran track.34 Playing in New Hampshire, due to the chilly weather he was limited to short baseball seasons, and some of his games were played as it snowed.3536 Fuld batted .613 as a freshman, and .489 as a sophomore with 11 steals. He led his club to a league title as a junior in 1999, as he batted .600 with 9 steals. As a senior he hit .550 with 6 homers, 12 RBIs, and 13 stolen bases.37 He was a three-time team captain and four-time MVP of the varsity baseball team.38
He was named a 2000 Pre-season First Team All-American by Baseball America, Collegiate Baseball, USA Today, and Fox Sports.39 Fuld was also listed 19th among the 100 Top High School Prospects of 2000 by Baseball America, and selected the New Hampshire 2000 Gatorade High School Player of the Year.404142 He was also a four-time Central New England Prep School Baseball League All-Conference player.43
Fuld also played from 1998&lt;U+2013&gt;2000 with the Dover Post 8 American Legion team. With them, he earned 2000 New Hampshire State Tournament MVP honors. He also led his club to a state championship.4445
College

A total of 94 colleges approached Fuld after high school, and he chose to attend Stanford University. He was an economics major there, ultimately graduating in 2004.4647 He was a star, record-setting 4-year starter in center field for the Cardinals, the school's baseball team.4849
In 2001, as a freshman, he batted .357 as he established himself as the team's leadoff hitter. Fuld was fifth in the Pacific-10 (Pac-10) conference in runs scored (56), sixth in walks (32), and ninth in hits (81). In the post-season he hit .396. He earned NCBWA Third Team All-American honors, and was named a Baseball America Second Team Freshman All-American, All-College World Series, All-NCAA Regional, All-Pac-10, and a Collegiate Baseball Honorable Mention Freshman All-American.50
As a sophomore in 2002, he led the Pac-10 in hits (110), breaking Stanford's single-season record, while batting .375, third-best in the conference.51 Fuld also led the conference in total bases (162), was third in runs scored (67) and doubles (20), and fifth in triples (4). He was named a First-Team (ABCA, Baseball America, Baseball Weekly) and Third-Team (Collegiate Baseball, NCBWA) All-American. He was also named a Jewish Sports Review College Baseball First Team All-American, along with future major leaguers Craig Breslow and Adam Greenberg.52 In addition, Fuld earned the Stanford Jack Shepard Memorial Award and Come Through Award. He batted .421 with two homers in four CWS games, earning a spot on the All-College World Series Team for the second straight year.53 Fuld also played with Team USA in the summers of 2001 and 2002.54
In 2003, Fuld was named a First-Team (NCBWA) and Third-Team (Baseball America) Pre-Season All-American. In the regular season, as a junior he tied the school season record for runs with 83 (# 1 in the Pac-10). He also hit .321 with 35 RBIs and 10 steals in 10 attempts, leading the conference in triples (9) while coming in fifth in hits (97), eighth in doubles (18) and total bases (145), and ninth in walks (34). In the post-season his 24 career hits broke the College World Series record of 23 set by Keith Moreland in 1973&lt;U+2013&gt;75.5556 And commenting on his defense, Stanford coach Mark Marquess said: &quot;If it's in the ballpark, he's going to catch it. He's the premier center fielder in college baseball.&quot;57 He earned All-Pac-10 honors for the third straight season. Reflecting on his college career, Fuld said: &quot;I think one of the things you take away from playing under Coach Marquess is whatever you do, be it baseball or anything else, you do it well and you do it with passion. You do it with excitement because, really, that's the way to go about things. Not only in sports, but beyond sports.&quot;58
Fuld was drafted in the 24th round (703rd overall) of the 2003 Draft by the Chicago Cubs, but did not sign.59 Marquess thought that Fuld might have been drafted relatively low because, as a 5' 10&quot; leadoff hitter, he did not fit the stereotype of a tall, power-hitting major league outfielder.60 But Fuld said of the Cub's bid: &quot;It was a generous offer. It was a tough choice.&quot;61 He then batted .361 with 14 RBIs and 10 stolen bases in the summer of 2003 for the Hyannis Mets in the Cape Cod League, and was voted a Cape Cod League All Star.62
Before the 2004 season, Fuld was named a First-Team (NCBWA), Second-Team (Louisville Slugger),63 and Third Team (Baseball America, Collegiate Baseball) Pre-season All-American, and an Honorable Mention Pac-10 All-Academic.64 Diving for a ball in the outfield in his second-to-last game in college, he broke his shoulder, tore his labrum, and partially tore his rotator cuff.6566 For the season, he received Honorable Mention to the Pac-10 All-Academic Team and All-Conference Team6768
When he became Stanford's and the Pac-10's all-time leader in runs scored (268), Fuld modestly said: &quot;It means a lot to break the record. Obviously, a record like that is more of a tribute to the teammates I've had over the last four years.&quot;69 When he graduated Stanford, in addition he ranked among the school's all-time top 10 in hits (353; # 2), triples (16; # 3T), and doubles (58; # 6T).70
Fuld said: &quot;I want to try my hand. It's been a lifelong dream, really, to play professional baseball. I just love it too much not to give it a shot.&quot;71 The Cubs drafted him for a second time, in the 10th round (306th overall) of the 2004 Draft, and this time Fuld signed.72 When he made it to the major leagues, he became the 78th former Stanford Cardinal to do so.73 During the baseball off-season, Fuld returns to Stanford to pursue a master's degree in statistics.74
Minor leagues
 The torn labrum injury he incurred in his second-to-last game of college in 2004 required surgery, and a full year of rehabilitation.75 During that time he read Michael Lewis's book Moneyball, learned about Chicago-based STATS, Inc., and applied through their website for an internship, which he received.767778 &quot;I was one of their reporters, which meant that I looked at game video and plotted the 'TVL'&lt;U+2013&gt;type, velocity, and location&lt;U+2013&gt;of every pitch,&quot; Fuld said. &quot;They have this grid where you click on exactly where the ball crosses the plate. Play the tape, pause, and repeat.&quot;79 He also began seeking out stats that were not already kept. &quot;There's so many statistics out there that I thought 'There's no stats on foul balls,' so I picked a few players and started tracking them, thinking I'd find something,&quot; Fuld said.80 But his bag that contained the notebook with all his stats was stolen.81
In 2005, he hit .300 with a .377 obp and 18 stolen bases in 443 at bats for the Single-A Peoria Chiefs of the Midwest League. He also had a 17-game hit streak, and turned in 7 outfield assists from center field.82
Fuld batted .300 with a .378 obp and 22 steals in 353 at bats for the High-A Daytona Cubs of the Florida State League in 2006, though he missed the end of the season because of a hip injury.83 He ended up needing an operation for a sports hernia after that season.84 He was named to the league All-Star team.85
In 2007, Fuld batted .291 with a .371 on base percentage, in 282 at bats, as he began the season with the Tennessee Smokies in the Double-A Southern League.86 &quot;He knows how to play the game, when to take a pitch, when to work the count, and when to go ahead and swing away and juice the ball,&quot; said his Tennessee manager, Listach. &quot;He&lt;U+2019&gt;s strong enough that he can hit the ball out of the yard occasionally. He&lt;U+2019&gt;s a gap, line drive type hitter. He knows what type of hitter he is, and he doesn&lt;U+2019&gt;t hit a lot of fly balls.&quot;87 He was an efficient leadoff batter for Tennessee, with more walks (41) than strikeouts (38)&lt;U+2013&gt;a recurring theme in his career, as he was touted by Baseball America as having the best strike zone judgment in the organization.8889 &quot;He&lt;U+2019&gt;s a very intelligent player,&quot; added Listach. He continued:

He plays the game the right way. He plays the game hard. He plays the game smart. He steals a base when you need a base stolen, not necessarily when it&lt;U+2019&gt;s 5&lt;U+2013&gt;0 or a lopsided score. He does it when the team needs it. He makes the plays. He throws to the right bases. He&lt;U+2019&gt;s a left-handed hitter. He can run. He&lt;U+2019&gt;s a prototypical leadoff hitter in the big leagues..... His work ethic is off the charts.90

Fuld was also touted by Listach as having the best outfield skills on the team, as he led the Southern League with 13 assists from the outfield.91929394 In August, Fuld was promoted to the Iowa Cubs in the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. There, he batted .269, with a .397 on base percentage.

Fuld played for the Mesa Solar Sox in the Arizona Fall League in the Fall of 2007. On October 30, he was named AFL Player of the Week, after hitting .526.95 In 29 games with the Solar Sox, Fuld led the league in batting average (.402), hits (43), doubles (11), extra-base hits (16), total bases (67), obp (.492), slugging percentage (.626), and OPS (1.118), and was 3rd in the league in runs (20) and walks (17), 4th in stolen bases (10), and 5th in triples (2).969798 He batted .462 with runners in scoring position, and .500 against lefties.99 Fuld was named the 2007  Most Valuable Player of the Arizona Fall League, after being the season's dominant player.100101102 He also was named to the AFL Top Prospects Team.103
Fuld also won the  Dernell Stenson Award for Leadership for unselfishness, hard work, and leadership, becoming the first player to win both awards.104105106 He donated all the money he raised from the auction he had in conjunction with winning the Stenson Award to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.107108 &quot;This kid plays the game like it's supposed to be played,&quot; said Mesa Solar Sox manager Dave Clark.109

In 2008, Fuld started the season with the Triple-A Iowa Cubs. There, due to his fearless defense, he was referred to as &quot;a crash test dummy with a death wish&quot;, a &quot;human wrecking ball act,&quot; a &quot;wall magnet,&quot; and a &quot;manager's dream and a trainer's worst nightmare.&quot;110
Fuld began the 2008 season at Triple-A Iowa, but was demoted to the Double-A Tennessee Smokies in May after struggling at the plate due to a right thumb injury. After hitting no higher than .245 in May, June, and July, he had a torrid August, batting .345/.424/.445. Fuld averaged only 1 strikeout per 9.9 at bats, good for fifth-best in the Southern League.111
Fuld had a &quot;big winter&quot;112 playing winter ball in Venezuela on the Tigres de Aragua,113 who he helped lead to a championship. He hit leadoff for Aragua, while batting .322 with 5 triples (leading the league), 36 walks and 43 runs (2nd), 16 doubles (5th), a .425 on base percentage (7th), and a .938 OPS (8th).114115116 For his 2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09 winter performance, including walking nearly twice as much as he struck out, he was elected to the Baseball America All Winter League Team.117
Fuld began 2009 at Iowa, and hit .286 with 20 stolen bases and 8 triples in 73 games, including .326 versus lefties, primarily playing center field until he was called up on June 30.118119120 He walked 32 times compared to just 22 strikeouts in 319 plate appearances, and had a .309 batting average with runners in scoring position.121
Major leagues
Chicago Cubs (2007&lt;U+2013&gt;10)
2007

In September 2007, the Chicago Cubs called up Fuld to the major league team.122 He made his debut September 5 against the Los Angeles Dodgers, as a defensive replacement.123 &quot;I have so much respect for players like (Cubs first baseman) Derrek Lee,&quot; Fuld said. &quot;They're great players. But to meet them and actually play with them and contribute and help them win is kind of a surreal experience. It doesn't seem too long ago that I was going to Fenway (Park in Boston) and idolizing these guys. I feel like a fan at times. I have to remind myself I'm a player.&quot;124
That month he was &quot;forced&quot; to sing Stanford's fight song on the team bus, as part of his rookie treatment.125 Later in the month, he was hazed after a game&lt;U+2014&gt;made to walk from the park in Cincinnati to the team's downtown hotel in a Batgirl getup, accompanied by Felix Pie in pink baby pajamas, Carmen Pignatiello (as Supergirl), and Kevin Hart (as Wonder Woman).126 After peeking at his outfit, before he had to don it, Fuld said: &quot;I think it was Batgirl. I was actually looking forward to it, believe it or not. [I didn't try it on] I'm pretty sure I would've looked good in it. Black's my color. I never did the frat thing in college, so this would kind of be like that.&quot;127 In mid-September, as Manager Lou Piniella had still not given Fuld an at bat, someone on the team hung a &quot;Moonlight Graham&quot; sign in Fuld's locker.128
Against the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 22, 2007, playing right field as a defensive replacement, Fuld raced back and made a &quot;spectacular&quot;, &quot;daredevil&quot;, jarring catch just left of the 368-foot marker in right-center field at Wrigley Field, slamming at full speed into the ivy-covered brick wall, and robbing the Pirates' Nyjer Morgan of extra bases.129130 In his next motion, Fuld then bounced off the bricks and wheeled, firing a one-hop strike to double off a Pirates baserunner at first base (see video of Fuld catch and throw to first).131132 The home crowd of 47,271 erupted, giving him a deafening standing ovation, and the Cubs who were on the field waited in front of his dugout to congratulate him.133 Thousands of fans chanted &quot;Sam-my! Sam-my!&quot; when he next came to bat.134135 &quot;That was amazing,&quot; said Fuld. &quot;They were going crazy.&quot;136137 General Manager Jim Hendry said: &quot;That's as good a play as I've seen by a Cubs player at Wrigley Field since I've been here.&quot;138 The play later made ESPN on Baseball Tonight as the # 1 web gem of the day. After the season, Paul Sullivan of the Chicago Tribune cited it as the Cubs' &quot;Play of the Year.&quot;139 Many Cub fans refer to it as: &quot;The Catch.&quot;140
2008
In 2008, Fuld pushed Pie for the center field spot during spring training. Piniella said that Pie was only &quot;a head or nose in front&quot; of Fuld,141142 and commented:

[Fuld]'s the type of kid who can catch your eye in one day. But the more you watch him, the more you look at his particular skills, he impresses you. He's an athlete and has really good actions in the outfield, and then he plays a small man's game with the bat, which is what he should do&lt;U+2014&gt;hits the ball all over, puts it in play, keeps it on the ground.143

Hendry observed: &quot;[Fuld] can run. He's a tremendous defensive player.&quot;144 Hendry also indicated that Fuld was among the club's untouchables, saying: &quot;We're not going to trade [Fuld]. It's pretty simple.&quot;145 In late March, however, Piniella said Pie would open the season as the starting center fielder over Fuld, and Fuld was sent down to the minor leagues.146147
2009
 Fuld played for the Cubs in spring training in 2009, but was sent down to their AAA team in late March to work on stealing bases.148 He was called back up on June 30.149 Hendry said: &quot;Sammy has been really hot. This will let Lou (manager Piniella) mix and match with outfield defense until Reed (Johnson) comes back.&quot;150
On July 1, 2009, Fuld recorded his first major league hit in his first major league start of the season, and second start of his career.151 Leading off the game Fuld hit a double against Virgil Vasquez of the Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park.152 &quot;It felt great to get the first one out of the way in the first inning,&quot; Fuld said. &quot;It kind of took the edge off the rest of the night. I felt comfortable all night long&lt;U+2014&gt;I really couldn't have asked for a better night.&quot;153 In the fourth inning Fuld made a sliding catch of a sinking liner (see video of Fuld's sliding catch robbing Vazquez of a hit), and in the fifth inning he charged a single and fired a perfect one-hop throw to the plate to throw out Jack Wilson at home (see video of Fuld cutting down Wilson to preserve the lead).154 &quot;It was huge,&quot; said Cubs starter Randy Wells. &quot;Sam Fuld, man, he gets to so many balls. He made a [heck] of a play throwing that guy out&lt;U+2014&gt;the perfect throw.&quot;155 The following month, he crashed into the left field wall while making a sliding catch in a game against the Dodgers (see video of Fuld making wall-crashing catch).156
Asked which player he would most like to switch positions with, Geovany Soto said:



I would like to change with Sam Fuld for a play in the outfield. He's running in the outfield, and all of a sudden he makes that catch, two inches before he hits the ground. Oh, my God, he lays out and then hits the ground&lt;U+2014&gt;that's amazing. I'd like to know what it's like to dive and catch the ball like that.157



Fuld hit the first home run of his major league career in the final game of the Cubs' 2009 season, on October 4 at Wrigley Field.158 He finished the season with the highest on base percentage (.409) of any Cubs player with 100 or more plate appearances.159
2010
Carrie Muskat, the Cubs' MLB.com beat reporter, wrote on March 1, 2010, that: &quot;I can see Fuld making the Cubs' Opening Day roster... Fuld has shown he can handle the part-time workload, can play all three positions, and can be used as a defensive sub or pinch-runner.&quot;160 On March 30, however, the Cubs sent him down to AAA Iowa.161 Piniella remarked: &quot;The decisions weren't easy.&quot;162 He was called up to Chicago for the first time in the 2010 season on August 19.163
Tampa Bay Rays (2011&lt;U+2013&gt;present)
After the 2010 season, Fuld was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays. He was traded with minor leaguers Hak-Ju Lee, Brandon Guyer, Robinson Chirinos, and Christopher Archer for starting pitcher Matt Garza, outfielder Fernando Perez, and a minor league prospect.164165
Tommy Rancel of ESPN opined that Fuld is an early favorite to become the Rays' fourth outfielder or late-inning weapon off the bench, and be &quot;Tampa Bay's version of Brett Gardner; albeit in a reduced role&quot;.166 Manager Joe Maddon noted what he referred to as Fuld's &quot;freaky-weird&quot; outstanding walks-to-strikeouts ratio: 325 walks vs. 272 strikeouts in his professional career.167 Rays hitting coach Derek Shelton observed that: &quot;[Fuld's] contact ratio is off the charts. He has probably one of the shortest swings I've ever seen.&quot;168 If Fuld were to not make the major league team, he would be subject to waivers, inasmuch as he is out of minor league options.169
