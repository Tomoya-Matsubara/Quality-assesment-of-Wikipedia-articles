J&lt;U+00E9&gt;r&lt;U+00E9&gt;mie Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re (born 30 March 1983) is a French footballer who plays as a striker for Lorient.
As a graduate of the elite Clairefontaine academy, he signed for Arsenal aged 16. After making his Premier League debut in the 2001&lt;U+2013&gt;02 season, he ultimately had limited opportunities, partly due to injury. For the 2005&lt;U+2013&gt;06 season he was loaned to three clubs, Celtic in the Scottish Premier League, West Ham United in the Premier League, and Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Football League Championship, before returning to Arsenal for another season, featuring in the 2007 Football League Cup Final loss to Chelsea. At the beginning of the 2007&lt;U+2013&gt;08 season he was sold to Premier League club Middlesbrough for &lt;U+00A3&gt;2.5 million, where he spent the next three seasons, two in the Premier League and the last in the Championship, before electing not to extend his contract and leaving the club in June 2010.
Club career
Arsenal
Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re signed for Arsenal at the age of 16 before the beginning of the 1999&lt;U+2013&gt;2000 season. As a youth player he held considerable promise and he holds the record in the FA Youth Cup for the most number of goals scored.
He made his Premiership debut for Arsenal against Fulham in the 2001&lt;U+2013&gt;02 season, replacing Thierry Henry in a 4&lt;U+2013&gt;1 victory, and he scored his first goal in a 5&lt;U+2013&gt;2 victory over West Bromwich Albion on 27 August 2002.1
In the 2003&lt;U+2013&gt;04 season, Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re was mainly played in the 2003&lt;U+2013&gt;04 League Cup rather than the league, scoring Arsenal's first League Cup goal of the season against Rotherham United. The match finished 1&lt;U+2013&gt;1 after extra time, with Arsenal winning 9&lt;U+2013&gt;8 on penalties.2 He also scored twice against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the following round of the League Cup,3 his second winning goal for the month for December. In total he netted four goals in the cup run, having also scored against West Brom in the quarter finals, with Arsenal finally being eliminated by Middlesbrough in the semi-finals.4 He was voted best young talent in the 2003&lt;U+2013&gt;04 League Cup.5 As the season went on, he made further inroads into the Arsenal first team, playing 10 Premier League matches, seven as a substitute, to gain a Premier League winners medal, as well as making his FA Cup debut in a 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 defeat against Manchester United.
Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re missed much of the following 2004&lt;U+2013&gt;05 season through injury, and was kept out of action until February. On his return, he made six substitute appearances for the first team. Although he failed to score in these matches, he scored eight goals in five games for Arsenal's reserves. Despite his limited opportunities, he was offered and signed a new Arsenal contract, running until the summer of 2009, announced at the same time as a loan move to Celtic.
Loan to Celtic
In the summer of 2005 Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re was sent on loan to Scottish club Celtic for the entire 2005&lt;U+2013&gt;06 season in order to play regular first team football. Despite his limited appearances, Arsenal manager Ars&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne Wenger had stated he had a future at Arsenal, but was currently being kept out of the side by the form of Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp.6 In the end, he made just two substitute appearances for the club, one in each leg of Celtic's loss to Artmedia Bratislava in the 2004&lt;U+2013&gt;05 UEFA Champions League.
Loan to West Ham United
On 24 August 2005 Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re decided to move back to London after a lack of first team opportunities, where West Ham United took over his year-long loan deal, having been promoted back to the Premier League after two seasons in the lower leagues. It was thought that his disappointment at being behind strikers John Hartson, new signing Maciej Zurawski and youngsters Shaun Maloney and Craig Beattie at Celtic contributed to his departure. Once again affected by injury, he only made eight appearances for West Ham, seven as a substitute.
Loan to Wolverhampton Wanderers
On 31 January 2006, West Ham terminated the loan, and Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re moved to the English Midlands to join the Football League Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers on loan for the remainder of the 2005&lt;U+2013&gt;06 season. He scored two league goals for Wolves, in games against Hull7 and Watford.8 At the end of the season he returned to Arsenal.
Return to Arsenal
Having returned to Arsenal, during the 2006&lt;U+2013&gt;07 season Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re was again mainly used in the 2006&lt;U+2013&gt;07 Football League Cup campaign, scoring both goals in their 2&lt;U+2013&gt;0 win over West Bromwich Albion on 24 October 2006.9 His first Premier League goal of the season came came on 16 December 2006, a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;2 draw against Portsmouth, with Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re playing for 70 minutes before being replaced by Robin Van Persie. Continuing appearances in Arsenal's League Cup campaign saw him score in the quarter-final against Liverpool F.C in a 6&lt;U+2013&gt;3 victory, and in the second leg of the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, with Arsenal advancing with a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1 win.1011 Arsenal ultimately lost the final 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 to Chelsea, with Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re featuring for 80 minutes.
With four appearances in Premier League matches during the season; as of 9 January 2007 he had played 37 times for Arsenal, 25 as a substitute, scoring nine goals, all but one coming in the League Cup, four against West Bromwich Albion. In the January 2007 transfer window Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re was linked with a move to the Premier League club Middlesbrough in North East England after Wenger said he would be allowed to leave the club. The move failed to happen however after Robin van Persie broke his foot, and he was told to stay at Arsenal for the time being. He made his final Arsenal appearance on the final day of the 2006&lt;U+2013&gt;07 season against Portsmouth in a 0&lt;U+2013&gt;0 draw at Fratton Park.
Middlesbrough
Middlesbrough signed Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re on 19 June 2007, for an initial fee of &lt;U+00A3&gt;1.5Â million. He scored his first goal in a Premier League match against Manchester United at Old Trafford, with a header to draw level at 1&lt;U+2013&gt;1, before Middlesbrough went on to lose the game 4&lt;U+2013&gt;1. This was his first Premier League goal since scoring his first ever for Arsenal on 27 August 2002. He scored for Middlesbrough against old club Arsenal on 15 March in a 1&lt;U+2013&gt;1 draw,12 before rounding off the season, scoring in the final day 8&lt;U+2013&gt;1 victory over Manchester City on 11 May 2008.
Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re got a red card and three match ban for slapping Javier Mascherano in a 23 February 2008 Premier League match against Liverpool, after Mascherano had raised his hands against him, in full view of the referee. It was the cause of controversy after Middlesbrough's consequent appeal was deemed as &quot;frivolous&quot; by the Football Association and extended by one more game, with the club's chairman and chief executive, and Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp, deeming this unfair and criticising the FA, contrasting it with a recent appeal by Chelsea's Michael Essien.131415
Before the start of the 2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09 season Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re switched to wearing the number 10 previously worn by midfielder F&lt;U+00E1&gt;bio Rochemback, when his number 11 was given to 3.2 million summer signing Marvin Emnes. He scored his first goal of the season in Middlesbrough's 5&lt;U+2013&gt;1 home victory against Yeovil Town on 26 August 2008. His first Premier League goal of the season came in a 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 win against Wigan Athletic at the JJB Stadium on 4 October 2008, scoring in the 89th minute of the match. After a run of not scoring in his next ten matches, he again scored against his old club Arsenal, with a headed equaliser in a home 1&lt;U+2013&gt;1 draw on 13 December 2008.16 At the end of the season, Middlesbrough finished equal bottom of the Premier League with West Brom, on 32 points, and as a result were relegated to the Football League Championship.
Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re was booed early on in the 2009&lt;U+2013&gt;10 season in the Championship by a section of the Middlesbrough fans. On 12 September 2009, he came off the bench against Ipswich Town to score two goals after 30 minutes of being on the pitch, and scored another goal in the same week against Sheffield Wednesday. His next goal came on December 26 against Scunthorpe United, in his first start under new manager Gordon Strachan due to injury. Having failed to reach the play-offs, and after three injury hit seasons at Middlesbrough, he left the club on 30 June 2010 at the end of his contract having decided not to take up the option of extending his contract. In total he had made 86 appearances, scoring 12 goals, for the club.17 2010&lt;U+2013&gt;11 pre-season found Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re training with West Ham with a view to a permanent move to the London club. The deal fell through when he damaged his knee ligaments playing in a reserve game against Crystal Palace. Subsequently his old club Middlesbrough offered the player full use of their rehabilitation and training facilities in order to overcome the injury and regain full fitness.18
Al Ain F.C., a club based in the city of Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates, announced on 13 February 2011 that they had signed Aliadiere,19 but he subsequently denounced their claim, stating that he had rejected a move and Al Ain had &quot;been very unprofessional in their conduct&quot;.20

There were rumours suggesting that Aliadiere will return to the Premier league with Stoke City for the 2011-2012 season. He was spotted at the club's training ground on several occasions during May 2011. It is speculated that any deal will be heavily performanced based due to Aliadiere's recent injury problems.
