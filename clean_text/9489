Distribution of town and cities in Alberta

Towns in Alberta are generally formed from communities with populations of at least 1,000 people.
Alberta has a total of 111 towns, with a population totaling 406,108 in 2005.1 The average Albertan town has between 3,000 and 4,000 inhabitants. 740 elected town officials ensure town governance throughout the province. When a town's population exceeds 10,000 people, the council may requests a change to city status, but the change in incorporation level is not mandatory.2 Communities with shrinking populations are allowed to retain town status even if the number of residents falls below the 1,000 limit.
A higher density of towns is found in the 400 km long Calgary-Edmonton Corridor, along the Queen Elizabeth II Highway. 72% of Alberta's population is concentrated in this region.3
Administration
As legislated by the Municipal Government Act4, a town is governed by a mayor and town council consisting of five to seven councillors. All town officials are elected by popular vote under the provisions of the Local Authorities Election Act.5 Candidates are required to be residents of their municipality.6 Alberta Municipal Affairs, a branch of the Cabinet of Alberta, is charged with coordination of all levels of local government. Administrative duties of towns include public safety, local transit, road, drainage, and waterway maintenance and garbage collection as well as coordination of infrastucture with provincial and regional authorities (including road construction, education, and health).
Administration is coordinated with the municipal district or county authorities, except for strong economic centers, which maintain administrative autonomy.
