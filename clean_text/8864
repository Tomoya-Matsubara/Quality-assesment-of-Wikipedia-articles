Alexandra Munroe (born 1957) is a curator and historian of modern and contemporary art from Asia as well as a scholar of world art studies and transnational art history.
Munroe organized the first retrospectives in America of several Asian-born artists, including Yayoi Kusama, Yoko Ono, Cai Guo-Qiang, and Lee Ufan. Munroe's survey exhibition Japanese Art After 1945: Scream Against the Sky (1994&lt;U+2013&gt;95) initiated the academic and curatorial field of postwar Japanese art history in the United States.12
In 2006, Munroe was appointed the Senior Curator of Asian Art at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. It was the first curatorial post of its kind in an international art museum devoted to modern and contemporary art.34
Education and travels
Munroe was born in New York City and raised in Mexico and Japan. She attended Brown University for two years and later received a bachelor of arts in Japanese Language and Culture from Sophia University (&lt;U+4E0A&gt;&lt;U+667A&gt;&lt;U+5927&gt;&lt;U+5B66&gt;) in Tokyo in 1982. She was awarded a masters degree in art history from the New York University Institute of Fine Arts, and in 2004, a Ph.D. in history from New York University. She studied under Harry Harootunian and wrote her thesis on postwar Japanese art and politics.5
Prior to her academic training, Munroe served as a resident lay disciple at Yotokuin, a subtemple of Daitokuji (&lt;U+5927&gt;&lt;U+5FB3&gt;&lt;U+5BFA&gt;) monastic compound in Kyoto, a historic center of Rinzai Zen from 1977 to 1980. She practiced chanoyu with masters of the Urasenke (&lt;U+88CF&gt;&lt;U+5343&gt;&lt;U+5BB6&gt;) school of tea and shimai with a master in the H&lt;U+014D&gt;sh&lt;U+014D&gt; (&lt;U+5B9D&gt;&lt;U+751F&gt;) school of Noh theater. Munroe is fluent in Japanese.6
Curatorial work and scholarship
Munroe's survey exhibition Japanese Art After 1945: Scream Against the Sky (1994&lt;U+2013&gt;95) initiated the academic and curatorial field of postwar Japanese art history in the United States.78 Munroe organized the first retrospectives in America of several Asian-born artists, including Yayoi Kusama: A Retrospective (Center for International Contemporary Arts, New York, 1989); YES Yoko Ono (Japan Society Gallery, New York, 2000; traveled to 13 venues in U.S., Canada, Japan, and Korea through 2003); Cai Guo Qiang: I Want to Believe (Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 2008); and Lee Ufan: Marking Infinity (Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 2011).The Third Mind: American Artists Contemplate Asia, 1860&lt;U+2013&gt;1989 (Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 2009) was among the largest exhibitions of Asian influence on American culture to date and received the inaugural Chairman&lt;U+2019&gt;s Special Award of $1,000,000 from the National Endowment for the Humanities.9
Museum career
As Samsung Senior Curator of Asian Art at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Munroe spearheads the museum&lt;U+2019&gt;s Asian Art Initiative, expanding the institution&lt;U+2019&gt;s mission to study, acquire, and exhibit art from beyond the Western world.10 In this role, she guides the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation&lt;U+2019&gt;s exhibitions, acquisitions, and public programs relating to Asian art for its museums worldwide. As a member of the Curatorial Working Group for the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, she helps shape the future museum&lt;U+2019&gt;s collection.11 Munroe has also organized and maintains the Asian Art Council, an advisory group composed of global art curators. 12
Under Munroe's direction, the Guggenheim launched The Robert H. N. Ho Family Foundation Chinese Art Initiative in 2013 with a $10 million grant to study, present, and acquire contemporary art from China.13
Prior to the Guggenheim, Munroe was an independent curator based in New York and Tokyo before, in 1998, becoming Director of Japan Society Gallery, and later, Vice President of Arts and Culture at Japan Society, an American organization dedicated to cultural and policy exchange between Japan and the United States. During her seven-year tenure, the society&lt;U+2019&gt;s contemporary art programs grew in size and stature through such exhibitions as YES Yoko Ono (2000) and the Takashi Murakami&lt;U+2013&gt;curated Little Boy: The Arts of Japan&lt;U+2019&gt;s Exploding Subcultures (2005). Both shows set record attendance for the institution.14 Munroe also curated the society&lt;U+2019&gt;s first inter-Asia loan exhibition, Transmitting the Forms of Divinity: Early Buddhist Art from Korea and Japan (2003) that was co-organized by the Japan Society; Korea Society, New York; Gyeongju National Museum, Korea; and Nara National Museum, Japan.1516

Barr Jr. Award for Outstanding Scholarship in a Publication, awarded by the College Art Association.24
