Miguel As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Palacios (1871-1944) was a Spanish scholar (an Arabist), and a Roman Catholic priest. He is primarily known for suggesting Islamic sources for ideas and motifs present in Dante's Divine Comedy, which he discusses in his book La Escatolog&lt;U+00ED&gt;a musulmana en la Divina Comedia [Muslim Eschatology in the Divine Comedy] (1919). He wrote extensively on Al-Ghazali [Algazel]. His major book El Islam Cristianizado (1931) presents a study of Sufism through the works of Muhyiddin ibn 'Arabi [Mohidin Abenarabe] of Murcia.
Life
Miguel As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Palacios was born in Zaragoza, Arag&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, on July 5, 1871, into the modest commercial family of Don Pablo As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n and Do&lt;U+00F1&gt;a Filomena Palacios. His older brother Luis, his younger sister Dolores, and he were little children when their father died of pneumonia. His mother the young widow continued in business with help and made ends meet with decorum but not as well as before. He attended the Colegio de El Salvador instructed by Jesuits in Zaragoza, all the while making life long friendships. He entered the Seminario Conciliar, singing his first Mass at San Cayetano in Zaragoza in 1895.1
At the Universidad de Zaragoza As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n had met and begun study under the Arabist Professor Juli&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Ribera y Tarrag&lt;U+00F3&gt;.2 In 1896 at Madrid he defended his thesis on the Persian theologian Algazel (1058-1111) before Francisco Codera Zaid&lt;U+00ED&gt;n and Marcelino Men&lt;U+00E9&gt;ndez y Pelayo.3 All three professors guided his subsequent studies. As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n then developed his study of Al-Ghazali, and published it in 1901. Next he wrote on Mohidin Abenarabe. Thus As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n was running parallel with a then European-wide effort to understand Muslim inner spirituality.45
Professor Codera then retired from his chair in the Arabic Language at the Universidad de Madrid to make room for As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n; Ribera allowed As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n to assume this c&lt;U+00E1&gt;tedra in 1903. Professor As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n lived in the same boarding house6 as Codera, and was well received in the university. By 1905 Professor Ribera had also come to Madrid and with As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n founded the journal Cultura Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ola (1906-1909). As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n attended international conferences in Algeria (1905) and Copenhagen (1908), where he engaged other Arabists and academics in Islamic studies. In Madrid he continued to prosper, eventually being admitted to the royal court where he gained the friendship of Alfonso XIII.78
As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n, of course, is known for his academic work concerning the medieval Christian-Muslim interface of theology, mysticism, and religious practice, with particular attention to medieval Spain. Among the figures studied were Al-Ghazali, Ibn 'Arabi, Averro&lt;U+00EB&gt;s (Ibn Rushd), Ibn Masarra, Ibn Hazm, as well as the rabbi Maimonides (all from Al-Andalus except al-Ghazali), and comparative work on Ramon Lull, Thomas Aquinas, Dante Alighieri, Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross, and Blaise Pascal.
As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's manner of approach was to stick to a theme, to keep circling over it, each time adding to the understanding. His method of work involved meticulous planning, conceiving the order of presentation in detail, then straight ahead, without a rough draft (&quot;sin borrador&quot;), redacted with each reference note on its proper page.9
In 1932 the journal Al-Andalus began publication under the direction of As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Palacios; it was technically equipped to satisfy a readership of academic specialists. As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n himself was a frequent contributor. In the universities, a new generation of Spanish Arabists was emerging, such as Emilio Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a G&lt;U+00F3&gt;mez, influenced by As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n.10
The Spanish Civil War began in July 1936, and caught As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Palacios while with his nephew and family in San Sebasti&lt;U+00E1&gt;n. The horrors of this struggle remain very painful to contemplate regarding both sides; over four thousand priests were assassinated by extremist factions on loyalist side early in the conflict. As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n was in danger, yet that September nationalist forces captured San Sebasti&lt;U+00E1&gt;n. During the war he taught Latin and managed to obtain photocopies of Arabic texts.111213
After the Civil War, As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n was able to return to his professorship in Madrid and to continue with his multi-volume study of Al-Ghazali.
Don Miguel As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Palacios had intense black eyes, fine hands; photographs did not capture the totality of his expression. He was well dressed (&quot;entre cardenal y torero&quot;). Not ambitious but for the tranquility in which to work, he was a good and generous friend. His colleagues recognized in him an enduring innocence, so that he was &quot;not knowing&quot; in the mixed turbulence of the world.14 He projected a brightness (&quot;diafanidad&quot;); his mind was a great work of refinement. A pious priest, an admirer of John Henry Newman, &quot;a child of 73 years&quot; when he died.15
That was on August 12, 1944, in San Sebasti&lt;U+00E1&gt;n.
Works
Following early publications on Algazal (Al-Ghazali) and Mohid&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Abenarabi (Ibn 'Arabi) as noted above, As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Palacios discussed, edited and rendered into Spanish translation many Arabic writings, and composed books and essays on related themes, including an occasional piece in Latin, French, or Italian.16
Aquinas &amp; Averro&lt;U+00EB&gt;s
As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Palacios researched Muslim influence on Tom&lt;U+00E1&gt;s d'Aquino (c.1225-1274), which would come particularly from the philosopher Ibn Rushd or Averro&lt;U+00EB&gt;s (1126-1198) of C&lt;U+00F3&gt;rdoba, whether as protagonist or antagonist. The result was his 1904 article.17 With respect to Greek philosophy, particularly Aristotle, As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n infers the analogous religio-philosophic positions held by both Averro&lt;U+00EB&gt;s and Aquinas, and as well by ben Maimon or Maimonides (1135-1204) the Jewish philosopher and talmudist, also from C&lt;U+00F3&gt;rdoba.18 As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n understood that it was with piety that Averro&lt;U+00EB&gt;s used reason to interpret his Islamic faith, and probes this issue for the sake of distinguishing him from several of the Latin &quot;Averro&lt;U+00ED&gt;stas&quot;.19 As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n also refers to medieval voluntarism (or asaries in Islam), in order to supply a contrast to the similarity in the rationalisms of Averro&lt;U+00EB&gt;s and Aquinas.20 Yet, many Thomists did not then accept without great controversy Asin's point of view.21
Ibn Masarra
In his 1914 book, Abenmasarra y su escuela. Or&lt;U+00ED&gt;genes de la filosof&lt;U+00ED&gt;a hispano-musulmana,22 As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n opens by describing the evolution of Islamic philosophy and cosmology at the center of Islamic civilization in the East, in comparison with its emergence and development in Muslim Iberia.23 A brief biography of Ibn Masarra follows, describing accusations of heresy and that he early concealed his teachings.24 Actually As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's work is less about Ibn Masarra (883-931) of Cordova, than about his &quot;school&quot; of early Muslim mystics in al-Andalus.25 With reference to their teachings and the religious context, As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n discusses the batini, the mutazili, the shi'a, and sufis, as well as Plotinus, and especially the pseudo-Empedocles.26 As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n also mentions several times a perspective he favored, of eastern Christianity's early influence on the young religion before Islam's arrival in the west.27 As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n traces the persistence of the philosophy of Ibn Masarra's school, and its eventual influence on Ibn 'Arabi, as well as on Ramon Lull and on Roger Bacon.28
Dante Alighieri
Perhaps As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Palacios is best remembered for his 1919 book, La Escatologia Musulmana en la Divina Comedia,293031 which suggests Islamic sources32 for the memorable context and perspective used by the Italian poet Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) in his La Divina Commedia. Specifically, As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n compares the Muslim religious literature surrounding the night journey of Muhammad (from Mecca to Jerusalem and thence up with the prophets through the seven heavens),33343536 with Dante's story describing his spiritual journey in which he meets various inhabitants of the afterlife. Accordingly, As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n (I) discusses in detail the above night journey in Muslim literature,37 (II) compares it to episodes in the inferno,38 the purgatorio,39 and the paradiso40 of La Divina Commedia, (III) investigates Muslim influence on corresponding Christian literature predating the poem, and (IV) conjectures how Dante could have known directly of the Muslim literature in translation. As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n remarks that notwithstanding these Muslim sources, Dante remains a luminous figure and his poem retains its exalted place in world literature.41 As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's book inspired a wide and energetic reaction, positive and negative, as well as further research and academic exchanges.424344 Eventually two scholars independently uncovered a buried source, the eleventh century Arabic Kitab al-Mi'raj [Book of the Ladder (or of the ascent)],4546 which describes Muhammad's night journey. This work was translated into Spanish as La Escala de Mahoma by a scribe (Abrahim Alfaquim) of Alfonso X el Sabio in 1264;47 news of the Latin version Liber Scalae Machometi has been traced to the Italian milieu of the poet, Dante Alighieri.4849 Although this missing link was not available to As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n, he had based his work on several similar accounts of Muhammad's ladder then circulating among the Muslims of Al-Andalus.50
Ibn Hazm
As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n published two early works on Ibn Hazm (Abenh&lt;U+00E1&gt;zam) of C&lt;U+00F3&gt;rdoba (994-1064),5152 who was theologian, jurist,53 and poet.545556 Then, from 1927 to 1932, As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n published his five volume study,575859 featuring a translation of Ibn Hazm's Fisal, a long work on the history of religious ideas. As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's first volume contains a biography and a critique of the medieval Spanish Muslim; the remaining four the translation of the Fisal,60 which has six parts: 1. non-Muslims (in As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's volumes II-III), 2. Muslim sects (III-IV), 3. Muslim faith and theology (IV), 4. several constitutional questions of Islamic government (V), 5. Muslim heresies (V), 6. theology in 29 questions (V). In part 1 of the Fisal, Ibn Hazm gives a polemical description of Christian scriptures and doctrine, its putative errors and contradictions, showing familiarity with the texts; he also comments on Judaism, Brahmans, sophists, atheists, and polytheists. As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's biography discloses Ibn Hazm as once vizier to the declining Umayyad caliphs before retiring to his study. A jurist of the Zahiri (or &quot;literalist&quot;) school of law,61 Ibn Hazm's work Ibtal62 on fiqh is mentioned. In his Fisal Ibn Hazm addresses possible rebellion against an unjust Imam.63 Later, writings of Ibn Hazm were discovered in the library of the Fatih Mosque in Istanbul, including legal responsa, to which Asin devoted an article.64
Ibn 'Arabi
Another well known work by As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n addresses the life and mystical philosophy of Ibn 'Arabi (1165-1240) from the city of Murcia. As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Palacios wrote a number of studies and translations of Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi,65 but his major work was El Islam cristianizado. Estudio del sufismo a trav&lt;U+00E9&gt;s de las obras de Abenarabe de Murcia (1931).66 Following an introduction regarding sufism, this book presents three parts: first, a short biography of Ibn 'Arabi [31-118]; second, commentaries on his mystical teachings, and also on his place in sufism and his subsequent influence [119-274]; third, translations taken from seven works of Ibn 'Arabi [275-518].67 As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Palacios was a western pioneer in Sufi studies, particularly regarding Ibn 'Arabi.68 Not surprisingly As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n assumes the viewpoint of a spiritually involved Christian academic; he sees in the works of Ibn 'Arabi many similarities with his own religion's mystical doctrines. Consequently As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n brings this spiritually informed consciousness to his discussion of the principles and practices taught by Ibn 'Arabi. For example, As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n mentions the purgative preparation required by Ibn 'Arabi in the four deaths: white, death to hunger; red, dying to passion; black, to endure suffering; green, to enter poverty.69 While some see adjacent virtues clearly, other mystics take a hard path of trials and of sorrows, to be humbled in the wilderness,70 yet later may enter transforming vision and mercifully receive a felicitous and loving unity.71 In his introduction, As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n observes that while Christian Spain became deeply affected by Muslim mysticism, beforehand the oriental Church had equally affected early Islam,72 which later arrived in the far occident where Ibn 'Arabi would be born. From the perspective of religious studies, it might be said that As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Palacios at points presents us with a multidimensional text for comparative religion. In his other works on Sufi practice, As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n mentions precursors of Ibn 'Arabi in al-Andalus (i.e., the school of Ibn Masarra), as well as those who drew on his teachings afterwards (e.g., the Sadilies or xadil&lt;U+00ED&gt;es tariqah).73 Here also, As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n refers to the many parallels between al-Ghazali and Ibn 'Arabi.74
Varia
Among As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's many articles are studies concerning the following subjects:75

Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) and his notion of a wager concerning the afterlife, with respect to similar ideas in Al-Ghazali;
Alumbrados, a dissindent group in Spain during the 16th and 17th centuries, similarities compared with the Sadili school.
Ramon Lull (1233-1315) who As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n discussed in his book on Ibn Masarra, and also with regard to Ibn 'Arabi;
Ibn al-'Arif (12th century) de Almer&lt;U+00ED&gt;a, mentioned by Ibn 'Arabi, arif meaning &quot;contemplation&quot;, but his with quietist tendencies;
Ibn Bajjah (1106-1138) of Zaragoza, also known in Latin as Avempace, with regard to the philosopher Aristotle.

Al-Ghazali
In the 1930s, As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n began yet another study of Algazel (1058-1111),76 expressly declaring it limited to a Christian interpretation.77 His investigation focuses on themes of spiritual practice from the forty volume magnum opus of al-Ghazali, the Ihya 'Ulum ad-Din [Revival of the Religious Sciences].78 A. J. Arberry in 1942 called it &quot;by far the most important monograph on Ghazali so far written,&quot; but adversely noted the importation of foreign religious sentiments into As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's work on the Muslim theologian.79 After addressing Al-Ghazali the person, including a short biography, As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n analyses the teachings of his Ihya in four parts: 1) his purgative ascetics, e.g., how to overcome sensuality, idle talk, anger and hatred, envy, worldliness, greed, glory, hypocrisy, pride, vanity, and spiritual illusion (in volume I); 2) his path to unity, e.g., penance, patience, gratitude, hope and fear, voluntary poverty, renunciation of the world, trusting in God, and love of God (vol. II); 3) his way to perfection, e.g., the life plan, purity and sincerity, conscience, meditation, and the religious song (vol. III); 4) al-Ghazali's mystical doctrine, to which As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n also provides a Christian interpretation.80 In the fourth, concluding volume, As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n translates selections from works by Al-Ghazali (21 titles other than the Ihya) and provides a brief analysis of each.81
John of the Cross
In 1933 As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n published in the first issue of the journal Al-Andalus an article about San Juan de la Cruz (1542-1591) and a doctrine he shared with spiritual Islam.82 This work can be seen to be equally about the saint's suggested forerunner, the Muslim mystic Ibn Abbad (1332-1389) of Ronda, and about Ibn Abbad's own sources in the Sadili school (tariqah).83 The doctrine shared84 concerns the soul on the path toward union with the Divine; God, being unreachably transcendent, the soul's only approach is to renounce everything but God.85 Thereby the soul enters a desolation in which he (or she) lives only for God, yet the desolation may become too severe, causing the soul to despair, so that the merciful Deity grants him (or her) inspiration, followed by a phase of elation; afterwards the soul returns to the way through desolation in order to move closer to God. The shared doctrine teaches that the soul passing through these alternating states of &quot;night&quot; (contraction from despair) and &quot;day&quot; (inspired expansion) may relinquish the charismata of God's inspiring favors, so as to pass more quickly beyond the difficult rhythm of &quot;night&quot; and &quot;day&quot;, so finding a repose, wherein to await the transforming union.86 As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n analyses the technical vocabulary used by the sadilis and by San Juan de la Cruz in order to further establish the connection.87
Teresa of Avila
In a posthumously published article, As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n discusses Santa Teresa de &lt;U+00C1&gt;vila (1515-1582).88 The similes and analogies she employed to communicate the experiences of her spiritual life89 are discovered by As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n to parallel those previously employed by mystics of Islam. In this instance the image used is of seven dwelling places or castles, one inside the other.90 As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n mentions the Tanwir91 of the sadili Ibn 'Ata Allah; the Tayrid92 of Ahmad al-Gazali (brother of Algazel); and, the anonymous Nawadir93 compiled by Ahmad al-Qalyubi, with its seven concentric castles.94 As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n draws out other mutualities in the matrix of symbols, e.g., the Divinity being in the central dwelling.95 Luce L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez-Baralt further explores this association of images, tracing the parallel to a ninth century Islamic mystic of Baghdad, Abu-l-Hasan al-Nuri (d.907), whose Maqamat al-qulub [Stations of the Heart] describes seven castles, one inside the other, through which the soul travels toward God.96 After quoting a passage in which Sta. Teresa describes her spontaneous acquaintance with the castle image,97 L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez-Baralt infers that Sta. Teresa's acquisition of the Islamic parallel was indirect, probably a popular allusion that lay dormant within her for years, resurfacing later to help her communicate her mystical experiences.98 Following related studies,99 Catherine Swietlicki discusses Saint Teresa's Jewish heritage,100 and her mysticism as filtered through the mutual presence of three faiths.101 The Catholic writings of Santa Teresa de &lt;U+00C1&gt;vila, widely recognized and revered, may accordingly be understood to reflect as well a generality of shared values among the Judaic, Christian, and Islamic faiths during those blessed periods of convivencia in medieval Spain.102
Perspectives
The works of As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Palacios are widely admired, notwithstanding criticism that his view point was of a Christian priest while involved in the neutral academic field of Islamic studies. In his own country, the labors of the Spanish Arabists, to which he contributed greatly, has over the generations worked to favorably alter the view shared by many Spaniards concerning the Muslim period of their history. His spiritual insights into Islamic mysticism illuminated formerly obscure figures and hidden connections. Perhaps, too, along with Louis Massignon and others, it can be said that the Professor Rev. Miguel As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Palacios was instrumental in the open recognition by the Catholic Church of Islam as a legacy of Abraham, articulated in the Nostra Aetate documents of Vatican II (1962-1965).

Nonetheless, what As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n presents here may be considered a modernist view point through a wide-angle lens, a philosophical anthropology.↩
Translated by Douglas and Yoder as The Mystical Philosophy of Ibn Masarra and his Followers (Leiden: E. J. Brill 1978).↩

In 1914 As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n thought that not a single work of Ibn Masarra nor any fragments survived [The Mystical Philosophy at IV:43]. As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n inferred his school's original teachings based on, e.g., medieval biographers (al-Faradi, al-Dabbi, Ibn Khaqan, and al-Maqqari [III:32,n.6]), two Iberian commentators (Ibn Hazm, and Sa'id of Toledo [IV:43]), and on the writings of his followers (in particular Ibn 'Arabi) [IV:43-44] and of his adversaries. Two manuscripts of Ibn Masarra have now been located (Kitab al-huruf [Book of Letters], &amp; Kitab al-tabsira [Book of Clear Explanation]); very recently both have been translated into Spanish by Pilar Garrido. As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n knew of these titles only from references to them by others, e.g., Ibn Hazm [III:41,n.23].↩
As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's theory that the pseudo-Empedocles was a source for Ibn Masarra himself has been challenged. Cf., Claude Addas, her Ibn 'Arabi ou La qu&lt;U+00E9&gt;te du Soufre Rouge (Paris: Editions Gallimard 1989), translated by Peter Kingsley as Quest for the Red Sulphur.

Cf., R.C.Zaehner, Hindu and Muslim Mysticism (Univ.of London 1960; reprints: Schocken 1969, Oneworld 1994) at 86-87, 92, 112.↩
As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n, The Mystical Philosophy (1914, 1978) at 73-82, 123-143, 173-183 (Ibn 'Arabi); at 136-144, 173-183 (Ramon Lull); at 134-137, 144 (Roger Bacon). All three lived during the 13th century. Independently, Henry Corbin in his L'imagination cr&lt;U+00E9&gt;atrice dans le Soufisme d'Ibn 'Arabi (Paris: Flammarion 1958), translated as Creative Imagination in the Sufism of Ibn 'Arabi (Princeton Univ. [Bollingen] 1969), citing As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n at 25-26 &amp; 48-49, &quot;saw&quot; connections through the alam al-mithal [subtle world] [35-36], between the school of Ibn Masarra via Ibn 'Arabi and the mystical philosophy of Muslim Iran, e.g., Suhrawardi's Ishraq [light].

The Mi'raj or night journey [mi'ray in Spanish] is briefly mentioned in the Qur'an at the sura so named (XVII, 1-2), and perhaps alluded to twice more (LIII,1; LXXXIV, 19).↩

As reported, in 2000 Maria Corti disclosed that Dante's Italian mentor Brunetto Latini (1220-1294) met the Latin translator of the Kitab al-Mi'raj while staying at the court of Alfonso X in Castilla. Cf., Dante e l'Islam (Italian interview with Maria Corti, April 2000). Latini's trip was probably circa 1259; he returned to Tuscany in 1266. Dante wrote La Divina Commedia much later, in his last years, 1308-1321. Prof. Corti comments on our surprise if Latini had given Dante a copy of the translation.↩

Yet the Addas text at 40, note 24, apparently mistakes As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's at 37, notes 1 &amp; 2, which cites and quotes the Fotuhat [III:311 &amp; I:363]. The very lengthy al-Futuhat al-makkiyya is the major work by Ibn 'Arabi; selections are translated in The Meccan Revelations (New York: Pir Press 2002 &amp; 2004 [2 volumes]), edited by Michel Chodkiewicz [first published in French and English as Les Illuminations des la Mecque (Paris: Sinbad 1998).

As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Palacios, La espiritualidad de Algazal y su sentido cristiano (Madrid-Granados: Escuelas de Estudios Arabes, 1934-1941). Nine of his prior works on al-Ghazali are cited by As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n, Ibid. at I: 20-21. Several of these are addressed by Valdivia V&lt;U+00E1&gt;lor in Don Miguel As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Palacios at 97-102, 116-118, 120-123, and La espiritualidad de Algazal at 123-125, 147-150.↩
As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n states that he will purposely omit discussion of Muslim influence on al-Ghazali because already adequately covered by other scholars, e.g., Goldziher, Macdonald, Massignon, and Nicholson [Prologue at 9-10]. Monroe in his Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship at 191-192, 194-195, probes this approach by As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n, and censures what it may infer, citing a blanket critique of orientalists (&quot;dry and sterile&quot;) made by [Seyyed] Hossein Nasr, Three Muslim Sages (Harvard Univ. 1964) at 156n1 (to text at 83).↩
Only a few volumes of al-Ghazali's Ihya have been translated into English, e.g., The Book of Knowledge or Kitab al-'ulm by Nabih Amin Faris (Lahore: Asraf 1962); and Remembrance of Death and the Afterlife or Kitab dhikr al-mawt wa ma ba'dahu by Timothy J.

As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n saw Islam as manifesting some similarity to a Christian heresy in its doctrines, given its espoused heritage, e.g., refering to Ramadan and Lent [Prologue at 15-16]. As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n repeatedly noted the subsequent mutual influence between the religions, hence his perceived bona fides in a Christian approach to al-Ghazali.

In this regard, As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n in his Prologue (La espiritualidad de Algazal at I: 18-19) refers to the Syrian Christian theologian Bar 'Ebraya (1226-1286), his Book of the Dove, in the annotated translation by Wensinck (1919). Another Syrian Christian theologian, Joannis Damascenus (676-749), in his Concerning Heresies discusses the &quot;Heresy of the Ishmailites&quot; at chapter 100 (attribution questioned), Muslims being called after Ishmael [Ismail] son of Abraham [Ibrahim].↩

Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Nieto, while not disputing the similarities discussed by As&lt;U+00ED&gt;n, is critical of any implied linkage between the earlier teachings of the Sadili sufis and those of San Juan.
