(34 titles) | website = Scottish Cup }} The Scottish Football Association Challenge Cup1, commonly known as the Scottish Cup2 is the main national cup competition in Scottish football. It is a knockout cup competition run by and named after the Scottish Football Association.
The Scottish Cup trophy is the oldest original national trophy in the world. It was first held in 1873-74, with the first winners being Queen's Park.
The current holders of the Scottish Cup are Dundee United, who beat Ross County 3-0 in the 2010 final on 15 May 2010.
Format

The competition is a knockout one. Teams are drawn against each other randomly. The team who is drawn first from each tie is the home team. If the first match finishes in a draw, a replay is played at the stadium of the second team drawn. In the replay, if the scores are still level at full time, extra time is played and (if necessary) penalties are used to decide the winner of the tie.
The semi-final matches are played at neutral stadiums, usually the national stadium (smaller stadiums if the teams do not bring a large support) Hampden Park and the final itself is traditionally played at Hampden. Celtic Park staged the finals in 1993 and 1998 and Ibrox staged the final in 1997 while Hampden was being redeveloped. The final and semi-final do not have replays and are played to a finish. Extra time is played and penalties are used if necessary. Two finals (1990 and 2006) have been decided by penalties.
Entry criteria
Previously clubs in the Third and Second Divisions qualified automatically for the first round, along with four non-league teams each from the Scottish Qualifying Cup (North) and (South) competitions. Clubs in the First Division and the Scottish Premier League had automatic byes to the third round. However, from the 2007&lt;U+2013&gt;08 season new criteria were introduced for entry into the Scottish Cup.3 The Scottish Qualifying Cup competitions were scrapped and the 36 SFA member clubs outwith the SPL and SFL were given direct entry to the 1st Round of the cup. Additionally, the league winners of the East of Scotland and South of Scotland Leagues, both of which contain some clubs that are not full members of the SFA and hence could not previously enter the Scottish Cup, were given a place in the draw.
Clubs from Scottish Junior football (all but one of whom are not members of the SFA as they belong to the Scottish Junior FA) were admitted for the first time in the 2007&lt;U+2013&gt;08 competition. Up to four Junior clubs are allowed to enter, these being the champions of the previous season's Scottish Junior Football North Premier League, the Scottish Junior Football West Premier League, the Scottish Junior Football East Region Super League, and the winner of the Scottish Junior Cup if they have not also won one of the three top regional league titles.4 The first three Junior clubs to qualify for the tournament were Culter, Pollok and Linlithgow Rose. During Season 2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09, Junior sides Bathgate Thistle, Pollok, Banks O' Dee and Lochee United will compete in the tournament.
European qualification
As with all domestic cup competitions in UEFA countries, the winners of the Scottish Cup qualify for the following season's UEFA Europa League (previously the UEFA Cup). If the winners have already qualified for a higher-ranked tournament, either by winning the league (or in modern times, finishing second), the cup runners-up are awarded a place in Europe. This has been quite a regular occurrence in Scotland, with either Rangers or Celtic often winning 'The Double', while Aberdeen also achieved that feat in 1984. In 2006, Heart of Midlothian had already qualified for the Champions League by finishing second in the SPL, and then won the 2006 Scottish Cup Final. Therefore, the Scottish Cup place in Europe passed to Gretna, the beaten finalists.
In 2008, the SFA announced that in such a situation the place would in future be awarded to the highest-placed club in the SPL who had not otherwise qualified for Europe. This followed some disappointing performances by middle-ranking Scottish teams including Gretna, Dunfermline Athletic and Queen of the South. All those clubs were knocked out at the first hurdle of the UEFA Cup which reduced the nation's coefficient, the calculation used to determine the number of places allocated in UEFA tournaments. UEFA blocked the proposed change, however, insisting that a club from the cup competition should represent Scotland. Therefore Falkirk qualified for the UEFA Europa League 2009-10, despite losing the 2009 Scottish Cup Final to league champions Rangers. Falkirk then lost in their opening European tie to FC Vaduz of Liechtenstein.
&quot;Giant killers&quot;

Because it involves clubs of all standards playing against each other, there is the possibility for &quot;minnows&quot; from the lower or junior divisions to become &quot;giant-killers&quot; by eliminating top clubs from the tournament. Some famous cup shocks include 1938, when Second Division East Fife were the victors in the final against Kilmarnock and thus won the cup.
On 31 January 1959, Highland League outfit Fraserburgh's won 1-0 against a Dundee side which had seven Scottish internationals in their side. In 1967, Berwick Rangers defeated Rangers 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0, Sammy Reid scoring the only goal of the match.
In 2000, Inverness Caledonian Thistle travelled to Celtic Park in Glasgow to face Celtic, then managed by former England and Liverpool player John Barnes. The then First Division side pulled off the most famous of cup-upsets, defeating the home side by a score of 3-1 and giving rise to the immortal newspaper headline the following day, &quot;Super Caley Go Ballistic, Celtic Are Atrocious&quot;. The result proved to be the catalyst for the departure of John Barnes as Celtic boss. Caley would also record another victory at home to Martin O'Neill's Celtic side in 2003.
Celtic, with a debutante Roy Keane in tow, also fell victim to Clyde, a side whose average age was 21, when they were beaten 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 at Broadwood Stadium in January 2006. On 10 April 2010, First Division club Ross County beat Celtic 2-0 to reach the final for the first time in their history.
