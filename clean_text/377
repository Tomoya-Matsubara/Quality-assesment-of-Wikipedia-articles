Hurricane Doreen was considered the worst tropical cyclone to affect California in 32 years. The tenth tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, and second hurricane of the very inactive 1977 Pacific hurricane season, Doreen developed from a tropical disturbance offshore of Mexico. After forming, the depression tracked northwestward, and intensified into Tropical Storm Doreen later that day. Further strengthening occurred in the following days, and Doreen had reached hurricane status early on August 15. Doreen then re-curved to the north-northwest and began approaching Baja California. As Doreen again re-curved to the northwest on August 15, it made two landfalls on the west coast of Baja California, the first time as a hurricane on August 15, and the second one as a tropical storm on August 16. Re-merging into the Pacific Ocean, Doreen paralleled the Baja California Peninsula and eventually weakened to a tropical depression on August 17. Early on the following day, the storm dissipated near the southwest coast of California.
Hurricane Doreen and its remnants caused severe flooding in northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States. In Mexico, heavy rainfall was reported on both Baja California and the mainland of Mexico. Flooding left 2,000 people homeless in Mexicali along the United States-Mexico border, in addition, 325 homes and businesses were destroyed in southern California. Several highways were also flooded during the passage of the storm, most notably, lanes on Interstate 8 and Interstate 15 were washed out. In San Diego and Imperial County, the total damage to agricultural interests was $25 million (1977 USD). In addition, eight fatalities were reported in California. Elsewhere, impact from Doreen or its remnants was relatively light.
Meteorological history

The origins of Hurricane Doreen were from a tropical disturbance which formed  west of Acapulco, Mexico, on August 11. Over the next two days, the system drifted westward at . By 0000 UTC August 13, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center began classifying the system as Tropical Depression Ten, which was centered  west of Acapulco, Mexico. Immediately after developing, the depression curved northwestward, and began slowly intensifying over sea surface temperatures (SST's) of . By 1800 UTC, winds increased to 50 mph (85 km/h), and the depression was then upgraded to Tropical Storm Doreen, which was centered about  west-northwest of Acapulco, Mexico. Air Force reconnaissance began investigating Doreen late on August 14, and located the center about  south of the tip of Baja California. Another flight into the storm shortly thereafter confirmed that Doreen had intensified into a hurricane at 1800 UTC.1
At the time, the eye of Doreen was around  in diameter. After becoming a hurricane, Doreen re-curved to the north-northwest as it sped up slightly to . Doreen approached Baja California, as it maintained minimal hurricane status. By August 18 at 1800 UTC, Doreen was centered only  when it curved northwestward. Late on August 18, the storm made landfall on the western coast of Baja California as a minimal hurricane. Shortly thereafter, Doreen re-emerged into the Pacific Ocean, over SST's of less than . As a result, Doreen weakened to a tropical storm before making another landfall on the Port Eugenia Peninsula on August 16 shortly after 0600 UTC. Once again, Doreen quickly re-emerged into the Pacific Ocean over the Bay of Sebastian Vizcaino. Due to SST's as low as , Doreen continued to weaken, and was downgraded to a tropical depression by early on August 17. After satellite imagery noted a poorly-defined low-level circulation, the final advisory was issued on Doreen , which was centered about  west of San Clemente Island, California at 0000 UTC on August 18. The remnants of the storm tracked into the Southwestern United States and dissipated over the Colorado River Valley.2
Impact
Mexico
 Hurricane Doreen dropped heavy rainfall along the western portions of Mexico and the Southwestern Region of the United States. In Mexico, Doreen produced heaviest precipitation along the Baja California peninsula, where rainfall peaked at  in the Los Cabos Area. The mainland of Mexico also received heavy rainfall, especially in the Sierra Madre Oriental mountains.3 In the city of Mexicali, the storm left more than 2,000 people homeless, many of which were shanty-style homes.4
United States
In anticipation of the storm, flash flood warnings were issued in the Colorado River Valley area, and were extended into southern California on August 16. Heavy rainfall fell in southern California on August 16. An average of  of rain fell over low-lying areas of southern California for a period of three days. Heavier precipitation was reported in the mountainous areas, where rainfall peaked at  on San Jacinto Peak. Several other locations also reported heavy rainfall;  was reported at the Los Angeles International Airport,  in Calexico, and  at Mitchell Caverns.56 At Edwards Air Force Base, the launch of Space Shuttle Enterprise on August 31 was delayed to September 7 after rainfall from Doreen flooded the runway of the previous flight.7 In addition to heavy rain, high winds were reported. In Palm Springs, wind gusts were reported as high as 60 mph (95 km/h). As a result, several trees were felled and power outages occurred.8 Overall, damage totaled to $25 million (1977 USD), which was mostly agricultural losses in San Diego and Imperial Counties.9
Doreen also produced heavy rainfall in a small area of southwestern Arizona, limited to the Yuma area. Along the border of Arizona, California, and Mexico, rainfall was recorded between .10 Rainfall in the state of Arizona had peaked at  in that area. 11 Light to moderate rainfall was also occurred in other areas of the state, such as Nogales, where  of precipitation was reported.12 Damage to roads, levees, houses, dikes were reported throughout the state, especially in the Bullhead City area.13
Further west, larger swaths of rainfall occurred in Nevada, though precipitation was generally light, with many areas experiencing less than . Rainfall in Nevada had peaked at  in Avaden,14 making Doreen the wettest tropical cyclone for the state of Nevada.15 In Las Vegas, major intersections were flooded due to precipitation amounts of about . In addition to street flooding, some roofs collapses occurred to houses and buildings.16
In New Mexico, lesser amounts of rainfall were reported, and precipitation was limited to the northeastern and southwestern portions of the state. Much it the rainfall was between ,17 and precipitation with the state peaked at  in the city of Florida.18 Rainfall was also minimal in the state of Utah, with only a few isolated areas reporting light precipitation, and generally did not exceed .19 However, rainfall peaked at  in Logan.20
While surveying damage in southwestern Arizona, a request was made to then-Governor Raul Hector Castro for $750,000 (1977 USD) in emergency services funds. The American Red Cross had been in the area and spent $12,000 (1977 USD) to assist families that were left homeless after the flood.21
