Francis Andrew (Andy) Brewin (September 3 1907 - September 21 1983) was a lawyer and Canadian politician.
Brewin was a stalwart in the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and ran numerous times at the federal and provincial levels in the 1940 and 1950s. As a lawyer in the 1940s, he was retained by the Co-operative Committee on Japanese Canadians to contest the federal government's deportation orders affecting thousands of Japanese Canadians. Led by Brewin, the 'Japanese Canadian Reference Case' was heard by the Supreme Court of Canada and later, on appeal, by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Brewin was also retained by a committee of Japanese Canadians who had been detained during World War II as &quot;enemy aliens&quot; in order to try to have their property restored. He succeeded in persuading the government to call a Royal Commission to investigate the question.
He was a candidate for the leadership of the Ontario CCF at the party's the 1953 leadership convention, but lost to Donald C. MacDonald.
Brewin was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons on behalf of the CCF's successor, the New Democratic Party. Brewin sat as Member of Parliament for the Toronto riding of Greenwood from the 1962 election until his retirement in 1979.
Andrew Brewin considered himself a Christian Socialist, and wrote a number of books and pamphlets on the topic.
