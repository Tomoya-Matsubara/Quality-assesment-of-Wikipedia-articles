Early life and education
Charles DeWitt Watts was born on September21, 1917, to parents who were church members in Atlanta, Georgia.3 He was the youngest of four children. His father owned a country store consisting of a butcher shop and a fruit store. The parents taught their children the importance of hard work. Watt's daughter, Constance Eileen Watts Welch, later said &quot;It was his work with the butcher that taught him the anatomy of animals before formally studying it, when he made steaks and roasts&lt;U+2026&gt;&quot;. Since his father had six sisters who desired to attend college, his father was not able to complete his studies in college; however, he urged his children to attain &quot;academic excellence without excuse&quot;.4
Watts was selected to attend Atlanta University Laboratory High School, a school created for exceptional students who were college bound, located at Spelman College's campus.5 He then enrolled at Morehouse College where during his first year his father died.6 At that time, he and his brother worked a paper route, delivering copies of the Atlanta Constitution every morning to support their education.78 Watts was encouraged to attend medical school by his Morehouse College biology teacher, Samuel Nabrit, as he was good at science subjects, especially biology. Watts received a degree in mathematics in 1938 from Morehouse College. After working at the Washington, D.C., post office to support his education, Watts attended Howard University College of Medicine.9
