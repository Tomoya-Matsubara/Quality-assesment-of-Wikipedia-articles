Xorr the God-Jewel is a fictional character in the Marvel Universe.
Six million years ago, a humanoid race covered its planet with a nuclear force shield for protection when its sun went nova. The planet wandered through space after the nova occurred, and somewhat slowly contracted to a fraction of its former size. The energy of the shield caused the planet to turn into a crystalline body. By then the planet had absorbed the life forces of its humanoid inhabitants and had become sentient. It called itself Xorr the God-Jewel, accumulated more energy by destroying worlds, and planned to conquer the universe.
Eventually, the force of a nova reduced Xorr to drifting debris, much of which was collected by the Gramosians led by Mercurio.1
Xorr claimed that its humanoid inhabitants were responsible for creating all humanoid races, including Earth humans, the Skrulls, and the Kree. However, Xorr's humanoids have no known connection with the Celestials, who did influence human and Skrull evolution, and there is no evidence to support these claims of Xorr's.
