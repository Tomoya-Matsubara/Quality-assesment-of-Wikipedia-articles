France was a pioneer in the automotive industry and is the 10th-largest automobile manufacturer in the world by 2011 unit production and the third-largest in Europe (after Germany and Spain).1234567
France is home to two major automaking companies - PSA Peugeot Citro&lt;U+00EB&gt;n (owner of the Peugeot and Citroen marques) and Renault S.A. (owner of the Renault marque and of Dacia of Romania, and Renault Samsung Motors of South Korea). The France-based Renault Trucks is a major producer of commercial vehicles and is owned by Volvo AB. Both PSA Peugeot Citro&lt;U+00EB&gt;n and Renault produce a large number of vehicles outside of France.
French-designed cars have won the European Car of the Year and World Car of the Year awards numerous times. The Citro&lt;U+00EB&gt;n DS took third place in Car of the Century award and has been named the most beautiful car of all time by Classic &amp; Sports Car magazine.89
