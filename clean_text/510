Richard A. Barone (born March 10, 1942 in Cleveland, Ohio) is an American entrepreneur, investment advisor, and activist investor. He is the Chairman of The Ancora Group, an investment advisor which he founded in 2001; Chairman of the Arch Eagle Group, a broker-dealer providing services to investment professionals; and Chairman of Mace Security International, a personal security company and pepper spray manufacturer.
Early career
After working for a regional broker-dealer, Barone founded the Maxus Investment Group in 1973. Maxus became a leading regional investment advisor and mutual fund manager (The Maxus Funds) 1 with execution capability on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. In 2001, Maxus was sold to Fifth Third Bank.2
During his early career, Barone, through Hedge Fund First Enterprise Group,3 acquired significant positions in publicly traded companies such as Peek 'N Peak Recreation,4 Diversified Industries5 and Hampton Utility shares.6 In April 1985, Barone made a tender offer for all shares of Peek 'N Peak.7
Career in the 1990s
In 1992, Maxus purchased Daley &amp; Company, a small Cleveland discount investment firm from Wedbush Securities.8 Several years later Maxus was able to expand assets under management with the purchase of Gelfand Partners.9 The acquisition doubled the size of the assets under management and diversified the product offerings to include Fixed Income. The combined companies had over $2 billion in assets under management. Terrence Johnson, a writer for the Cleveland Plain Dealer, called Barone &quot;a self-described dreamer that has single-handedly turned a three-man operation...into one of the biggest players in Cleveland's money management sector&quot;.10
In 1999, First Security Corporation purchased the Comstock Bank of Nevada.11 Comstock was a state chartered FDIC bank, financed and controlled by Barone and investors.12 At the closing of the transaction. Wells Fargo bid on and ultimately purchased First Security.13
Other notable acquisitions in the 1990s included positions in publicly traded companies such as Park Ohio,14 Rockefeller Center Properties,15 Scott's Liquid Gold,16 Rocky Brands,1718 Olympic Steel,19 and Bull &amp; Bear Group,20 a New York based money management firm. During the late 1990s the Maxus Investment Group purchased an ownership position in Donna Karan. In December 2000, Louis Vuitton had plans to purchase Donna Karan, at a price which Barone felt was low. The offer price was eventually raised by $22 million.21 22 23
Later career
In 2001, Barone sold the Maxus Investment Group to Fifth Third Bank. At the time Barone stated, &quot;With what's going on in the industry today, we thought we needed to team up with a premier institution to be able to offer our clients a greater product line and services.&quot; 24
With that sale, Fifth Third Bank decided that they were not interested in Daley Securities which Maxus had purchased in 1992. Barone purchased Daley back and converted its operation into a Friends and Family office. By 2005, Daley's business began to grow and with the return of several Maxus Investment Group executives, Daley became the nucleus for the formation of The Ancora Group Inc., an investment management firm which Barone currently chairs.25
Barone recently launched The Arch Eagle Group Inc., a provider of investment services to investment professionals such as hedge fund managers, investment advisors and other small broker-dealers. In 2011, he was elected Chairman of Mace Security International, a pepper spray products and personal protection company which he helped refinance.26
Investment philosophy
Barone's investment philosophy which has been developed over the last 45 years, is based on value investing. In the early 1970s, recalling several conversations with investor Warren Buffett, Barone concluded that several aspects of value are important to a transaction. According to Barone, these comprised branded products, pricing power, and free cash flow relative to market price. Investments in publicly traded corporations should only be made at corresponding values one would make if buying the whole company in a private transaction. According to Barone, volatility and uncertainty are good for creating investment opportunities, not a detriment. &quot;When we see prices drop, that just means we're buying businesses at even less.&quot;.27
Barone's investment history has been written about in Barron's,28 The Wall Street Transcript,29 New York Times,30 and Individual Investor.31
Boardships
In 2002, Barone joined the Board of the Cleveland State University Foundation. The Foundation works closely with Cleveland State's Office of University Advancement on fund raising projects.32 In 2008, Barone became Chairman of the Cleveland State University Foundation.33 In that same year, Barone became a community member of the Cleveland State University Board of Trustees.
In 2007, Barone was elected to the Board of Directors of The Stephan Company, a publicly traded manufacturer and distributor of haircare and skincare products.

The Brentwood Foundation, now part of the Cleveland Clinic Health Organization, was established in 1994 as a charitable trust dedicated to the promotion and advancement of medical education, clinical research, and community initiatives that impact health and wellness in the field of osteopathic medicine.34
In the Fall of 2008, Barone was elected to the Board of Directors for the Hospice of the Western Reserve.35 He began serving his tenure in January, 2009. Prior to being elected to the Board of Directors, Barone provided both financial and investment consulting services to the organization, which provides hospice services throughout Northeast Ohio.

Mace Security International is a publicly traded company which offers personal defense sprays, home and business surveillance and security, automotive security and child safety and security. Dennis Raefield, CEO and President of Mace, said &quot;we are excited to have Mr. Barone as a member of the Mace Board as he was elected by a unanimous vote.
