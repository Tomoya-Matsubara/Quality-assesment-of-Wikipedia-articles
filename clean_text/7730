 The Federal Highway (official designation: National Highway 23) is a short highway in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory in Australia. It is a part of the Sydney-Canberra National Highway link.
The Federal Highway starts at its junction with the Hume Highway near the city of Goulburn. It runs about eighty kilometres south west to Canberra, the national capital of Australia. The Federal Highway runs past Lake George.
It was initially constructed from 1932 to 1934, replacing the previous access from Goulburn (via Tarago and Queanbeyan). From 1986 onwards, the Federal Highway was reconstructed to a full four-lane divided highway standard, a project finally completed in 2000.
