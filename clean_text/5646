Composition and critical reception
&quot;Wipe Your Eyes&quot; is a mid-tempo piano-driven ballad with a length of three minutes and thirty-four seconds.1213 It contains sample of the recording &quot;Cabali&quot; which is written by Damon Albarn, Mariam Doumbia and Marc A. Moreau published by Chrysalis Music.14 &quot;Wipe Your Eyes&quot; starts with &quot;crooning by a chipmunk-like voice&quot;, and after that Levine professes &quot;I&lt;U+2019&gt;m here to wipe your eyes&quot; to his broken-hearted romantic interest.15 Brittany Frederick of StarPulse criticized the opening of the song labeling it as &quot;jarring nonsensical sounds&quot; which can also be heard in the background. However, according to her, &quot;they're minor issues with an album that is bound to get at least one song other than 'Payphone' stuck in your head.&quot;16 Alt Rock Live's Keaton Fletcher in a review of Overexposed, wrote that the beginning of the song makes you ask yourself &quot;do you really want to listen to this song?&quot; However, he concluded that after its first thirty seconds it sounds like typical Maroon 5 song on which you feel smooth sexuality.17 A reviewer of Kiss 95.1 radio wrote that &quot;Wipe Your Eyes&quot; together with &quot;Love Somebody&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Goodbye&quot; are a &quot;fan favorites&quot; songs.18
