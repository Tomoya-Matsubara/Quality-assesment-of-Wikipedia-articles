Farrelly began his career by training in Larry Sharpe's Monster Factory wrestling school. He officially debuted six days after completing his training and wrestled as a fan favorite under the name Sheamus O'Shaunessy. A serious neck injury, however, sidetracked his career for two years.4
In May 2004, still using the ring name Sheamus O'Shaunessy, Farrelly returned to wrestling at the newly opened Irish Whip Wrestling school in Dublin. He then made his debut match for the promotion at their Mount Temple show on July 9 against Mark Burns, who he squashed. He then went on to wrestle and defeat several international wrestlers, including Vid Vain, Matt Striker, Xavier, and Mikey Batts. In March 2005, he defeated Vid Vain, Darren Burridge, and former ally Red Vinny to become the IwW's first ever International Champion. O'Shaunessy later began a scripted rivalry with Burridge for the title. During a title defense against D'Lo Brown, Burridge hit him in the head with a baton, thus costing O'Shaunessy the match and his title. O'Shaunessy and Burridge finally squared off in a grudge match, which saw O'Shaunessy successfully exact his revenge and win the match. He then set his sights on winning his championship back and defeated both Red Vinny and Vic Viper to become a participant in a triple threat match for the International title against D'Lo Brown and The Assassin at a show in Newcastle in October. O'Shaunessy pinned Brown to win the match and his second International title. He then successfully defended his title against Vampiro in late 2005.

On March 24, 2007, O'Shaunessy debuted for RQW by defeating Stu Sanders. He then went on to have a popular feud with Drew Galloway, which resulted in their first match against each other on April 20 that ended in a double countout. On June 16, both men faced off for the second time, this time in a No Holds Barred match, in which Galloway came out as the winner. Soon afterward, O'Shaunessy left RQW.
