  Entrepreneur Richard Branson, head of Virgin Galactic, offered William Shatner, the actor who portrayed James T. Kirk Captain Kirk in the original Star Trek series, a free ride into space on the inaugural space launch of the VSS Enterprise, with a retail value of $200,000. However, Shatner turned it down, and said, I do want to go up but I need guarantees I'll definitely come back.

Flight test program
Projections by Virgin Galactic in 2008 called for test flights to begin in late 2009 and commercial service to start in 2011.cite web url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/12/21/320386/world-exclusive-video-spaceshiptwos-mothership-maiden.html  title=Coppinger, Rob, SpaceShipTwo's mothership maiden flight, Flightglobal.com, December 21, 2008  publisher=Flightglobal.com  date=  accessdate=2010-03-25

In October 2009, Virgin Galactic CEO Will Whitehorn outlined the flight test program for SpaceShipTwo. The test program includes seven phases:
Vehicle ground testing.
Captive carry under White Knight Two.
Unpowered glide testing.
Subsonic testing with only a brief firing of the rocket.
Supersonic atmosphere atmospheric testing.
Full flight into suborbital space.
Execute a detailed and lengthy appraisal process with the FAA/AST to demonstrate the system's robustness and eventually obtain a Office of Commercial Space Transportation#Licensed launch vehicles commercial launch license to begin commercial operations.Cite video  people = Will Whitehorn  title = International Astronautical Congress 2009: Civilian Access to Space  medium = video, comments at c. 20:00  publisher = Flightglobal Hyperbola, Rob Coppinger  location = Daejeon, Korea  url = http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/hyperbola/2009/10/video-iac2009-civilian-access.html  date = 2009-10-27

On 22 March 2010, the SpaceShipTwo vehicle VSS Enterprise underwent a captive carry test flight, with the parent White Knight Two aircraft, VMS Eve VMS Eve, performing a short flight while carrying the Enterprise.cite news  title=Maiden flight for Branson's SpaceShipTwo  newspaper=ABC News Australian Broadcasting Corporation  date=2010-03-23  url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/03/23/2853436.htm
A second test flight was made on 16 May 2010,

Retrieved 2010-05-21. reaching SS2's launch altitude 51,000 feet and lasting nearly five hours, in order to facilitate cold soak testing of SS2's avionics and pressurization system. Thereafter, a simulated spaceship descent/glide mission was made from launch altitude.

Between these two flights, the SpaceShipTwo airframe was modified by the addition of two interior fins, with one fin being added to the inside rocket-side of each of the craft's twin vertical stabilizers.

On 15 July 2010, VSS Enterprise made its first crewed flight. The craft remained attached to VMS Eve as planned, and underwent a series of combined vehicle systems tests. The flight lasted a total of 6 hours and 21 minutes. A second, similar crewed flight of VSS Enterprise and VMS Eve was carried out on 30 September 2010, lasting approximately 5 hours. Among the objectives of these flights was the improvement of pilot proficiency, and the results of the flights were deemed to show that the systems were capable of supporting future glide missions.

On 10 October 2010, VSS Enterprise made its first manned gliding test flight. It was released from VMS Eve at 45,000 feet and glided to a safe landing at the Mojave Air and Spaceport.http://www.virgingalactic.com/news/item/vss-enterprise-completes-first-manned-glide-flight/ VSS Enterprise Completes First Manned Glide Flight.

Future
Virgin Galactic aims to become the world's first commercial space line. The test-flight program is expected to continue through 2011, and future tests will focus on rocket motor testing and powered flights. Eventually, the rocket plane will be taken 60,000 feet above the Earth by its carrier and fire rockets to propel itself into space. A total of 370 customers have already placed a deposit totaling $50 million for a place on the flight, and about 80,000 people have placed their names on the waiting list. The trip will cost about US$200,000, and passengers will experience a few minutes of weightlessness during the suborbital flight.cite news  url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11511604   work=BBC News   title=Virgin Galactic's spaceship makes solo flight   date=2010-10-10cite news  url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TRAVEL/10/11/california.space.flight/index.html?hpt=C2   work=CNN   title=Virgin Galactic successfully tests VSS Enterprise   date=2010-10-16

The passenger-carrying commercial launches will initially occur at Virgin Galactic's launch pad at Spaceport America, near Upham, New Mexico.
