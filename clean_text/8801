Limnanthes floccosa or woolly meadowfoams are a species of meadowfoams found in Northern California and Southern Oregon, in the United States. All four remaining subspecies are listed as critical or endangered.12345
Subspecies
The representative subspecies is sometimes known as limnanthes floccosa bellingeriana, however the name limnanthes floccosa floccosa is more common.67
Bellinger's meadowfoam
The representative subspecies is commonly known as either Bellinger's meadowfoam or simply the woolly meadowfoam. The subspecies was named for Dr. and Mrs. Bellinger who first collected a sample of the herbaceous plant in 1936. It can be found in the foothills of northern California.89
Big-flowered woolly meadowfoam
Subspecies limnanthes floccosa grandiflora (the big-flowered meadowfoam) is only known to grow near vernal pools the Agate Desert, an area near White City, Oregon. It is not as &quot;woolly&quot; as Bellinger's meadowfoam but sparse trichomes can be seen on the leaves and stems.10
Dwarf woolly meadowfoam
Unlike the rest of limnanthes floccosa, subspecies pumila actually has smooth leaves and stems. The  plant inhabits the edges of vernal pools and wetter areas, but is only known to grow on the Upper and Lower Table Rock lava formations in the Rogue Valley, Oregon.11
