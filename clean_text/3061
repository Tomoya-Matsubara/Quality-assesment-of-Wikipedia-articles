The 1987 Atlantic hurricane season was an average Atlantic hurricane season that was limited by an ongoing El Ni&lt;U+00F1&gt;o. The first tropical depression of the season developed on May 25, prior to the official start of the season on June 1; the last cyclone dissipated on November 14. The season marked the first year tropical storm watches and warnings were issued; previously, gale watches and warnings were used for tropical storms.
With fourteen tropical cyclones, of which seven attained tropical storm status, the season was relatively quiet, and was somewhat unusual in that there were no United States deaths.1 Hurricane Emily was the deadliest and most notable storm of the season, causing $65 million in damage (1987 USD) as it ravaged the Dominican Republic and Bermuda. __TOC__

Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts like Dr. William M. Gray, and his associates at Colorado State University. A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 6 to 14 named storms, with 4 to 8 of those reaching hurricane strength, and 1 to 3 major hurricanes. The June 2, 1987 report suggested that eight tropical storms would form during the 1987 season, five of them becoming hurricanes.2 However, the forecasts proved too high, as only seven tropical storms formed, three of them hurricanes.3
The 1987 Atlantic hurricane season had 14 tropical depressions form from May 25 to November 5. Seven of the depressions strengthened into tropical storms, six of them named.4 (Tropical Depression Two was upgraded into a tropical storm in post-season analysis, and has no name.) Tropical Storms Arlene, Emily and Floyd all reached hurricane status during their period.5 Only one of the three, Emily, reached major hurricane status. Tropical Depression Fourteen may have been a tropical storm in its lifetime, but it remains a tropical depression.
The United States only got affected by four tropical systems this year, Tropical Depression One, which hit Florida, the unnamed storm which hit the Gulf Coast, while Hurricane Floyd and Tropical Depression Fourteen struck Florida as well.67
Storms
Tropical Depression One


A low-pressure area was researched by a Reconnaissance Aircraft and declared it the first tropical depression of the year on Monday, May 25, one week before the official season began.8 The depression was  from the east central Bahamas, whilst moving at about . The depression moved towards Florida and stalled off the coast, producing thundershowers across the state on May 28.9 The Bahamian government released a storm warning for its northern islands as Tropical Depression One grew stronger,  of Nassau.10 There was a chance that the depression could reach tropical storm status before landfall. The tropical depression made landfall in Florida on May 31.11 The tropical depression degenerated into a wave on June 1, the official start of the hurricane season.12


Unnamed Tropical Storm


The second tropical depression of the season formed in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico from a tropical wave on August 9.13 It quickly strengthened into a tropical storm, though the strengthening was not known at the time. Based on lack of significant organization or reports at the time, the storm remained unnamed. It traveled northwestward and as it neared the coast, the first tropical storm warning ever issued for a tropical system was issued for the Texas and Louisiana coasts from Galveston to Lake Charles. The tropical storm made landfall near High Island, Texas on the 10th, and quickly weakened to a tropical depression as it moved northeastward.14 It turned to the southeast, reached the Gulf of Mexico, accelerated to the northeast, and dissipated over Georgia on the 17th. Up to 21 inches of rainfall was associated with the storm, causing flash flooding and water damage amounting to $12.4 million (2005 USD).1516


Hurricane Arlene

A low pressure system on the tail end of a stationary cold front organized into a subtropical depression on August 8 near the South Carolina coast, and drifted southward.17 Convection organized more, and the storm was classified Tropical Depression Three on August 10 over the Bahamas. It executed an anticyclonic loop to the northeast, and was estimated to have attained tropical storm status on August 11, based on reports from Hurricane Hunters. Small cells in the ridge of high pressure caused Arlene to take an unusual track to the east, with two southward jogs in its path.18 A trough of low pressure near Bermuda initially inhibited strengthening. However, after high pressures to its east forced the storm northward, more favorable conditions allowed Arlene to intensify into a hurricane on August 22.19 Operationally, it was upgraded two days earlier, based on the appearance of an eye feature on satellite imagery. After becoming a hurricane, Arlene accelerated to the northeast into the cold waters of the north Atlantic Ocean, and on August 23 it became extratropical about halfway between Newfoundland and Ireland. The extratropical remnants turned to the southeast and later to the east, making landfall on the Iberian Peninsula before dissipating on August 28 over Spain.20
As Arlene approached, islanders of Bermuda were warned to board up their homes, with winds of  expected.21 Ultimately, the island experienced winds of  with gusts up to .22 A 41-year old blind sailor on a trip across the Atlantic was unable to make it to a harbor in Bermuda due to the hurricane, and rode out the storm in the open sea.23 The storm produced moderate rainfall to coastal areas of Spain, contributing to a monthly rainfall record at Rota.2425 The 14.5 day total between the start of its best track and when it attained hurricane status is the largest on record for an Atlantic hurricane.26


Tropical Depression Four


A tropical depression formed off the coast of Antigua on August 14.27 There were chances that the depression could strengthen, but that did not occur. Tropical Depression Four peaked at 35 mph (55 km/h) and dissipated on August 15.28


Tropical Storm Bret

A well-organized tropical disturbance formed off the African coast on August 17 and became a tropical depression the following day, as classified by satellite imagery.29 Later the same day, the ship S.S. Columbus Canterrury reported  winds and a minimal pressure of 1004 millibars, and the depression became Tropical Storm Bret.
The cyclone moved a westward course of 20 -  and reached its peak intensity of 50 mph and 1000 millibars on August 20.30 A ridge of high pressure in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, north of Bret, began to weaken and drift to the east on the 20th. The storm was moving at  to the east on August 21. It was thought that Bret would strengthen at this point.31 Bret slowed from August 21 until August 23, moving at only 15 - 20 mph.32 The cyclone soon moved on a northwestward course and encountered wind shear. Bret weakened into a depression on August 23, due to the wind shear over the system. The next morning, the depression became a tropical wave with no low-level circulation left. The wave was soon absorbed by a trough of low pressure during the next few days. Bret never affected land, during its existence.33


Tropical Depression Six


A tropical depression formed off the African coast on August 31, in which forecasters predicted would become the third tropical storm of the season.34 At 6 AM August 31, the depression was seemingly appeared unchanged, staying at winds of about 35 mph (55 km/h). The depression was then located  west of Sao Taigo in the Cape Verde Islands, stirring up  seas.35
The next day, Tropical Depression Six moved eastward becoming  off the Cape Verde Islands, too far for the National Hurricane Center to send a reconnaissance flight into the depression.36 Tropical Depression Six was at the time not a threat to land and few ships were in the area.37 Tropical Depression Six degenerated into a tropical wave on September 4, never affecting land or reaching storm-intensity. Redevelopment was possible, but that did not occur.38


Tropical Storm Cindy

On September 1 a tropical wave exited the African coast, and moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean.39 A trough of low pressure moved southeastward through the tropics, and brought the wave more towards the north. Generally favorable conditions for development allowed the wave to organize into a tropical depression on September 5, and two days later it attained tropical storm status. Cindy continued northward, and peaked at  winds on the 8th before turning to the northeast. Strong upper-level shear weakened the storm, and after two days of struggling as a tropical storm, Cindy became extratropical on the 10th to the northwest of the Azores.40
Cindy did not affect any landmasses.41


Tropical Depression Eight


A tropical depression formed in the Caribbean Sea on September 5. It tracked westward through the body of water, and reached peak winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) on September 7.4243 Despite its well-organized appearance, Tropical Depression Eight failed to develop further and dissipated on September 8.44


Tropical Depression Nine


An upper-level cyclone in the northern Gulf of Mexico spurred tropical cyclogenesis offshore the southeast United States. Convection organized around a low pressure area east of Florida, and it was declared Tropical Depression Nine on September 7. Initially poorly organized,45 the depression moved generally northward without strengthening, and quickly made landfall along the coast of South Carolina. It maintained its identity as it tracked through North Carolina and the Mid-Atlantic States, and on September 10 the depression merged with a frontal wave over New England. The cyclone dropped moderate precipitation along its path, peaking at 10.27 inches in central Virginia; stations in Maryland, the Carolinas, and Pennsylvania reported over 5 inches (125 mm) of rainfall.46 Flash flood warnings were issued in some localities due to the precipitation, and in Virginia over 50 roads were washed out.47 Slick roads caused three tractor-trailers to jackknife along a 2 mile (3 km) portion of the Capital Beltway. Additionally, four people required rescue assistance after being trapped in swollen creeks.48


Tropical Storm Dennis

A tropical depression formed on September 8 off the coast of Africa. It tracked westward, passing to the south of the Cape Verde islands, and based on satellite imagery was estimated to have reached tropical storm status on September 10. Tropical Storm Dennis continued to gradually intensify, and on September 11 attained peak winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1000 mbar (hPa). Subsequently the cyclone weakened to minimal tropical storm status,49 and by September 14, Dennis was expected to immediately weaken to tropical depression status.50 However, Dennis remained a minimal tropical storm for four more days before deteriorating to a tropical depression on September 18, as reported by a Hurricane Hunters plane. The depression turned abruptly northwestward through a weakness in the subtropical ridge, suggesting a new low pressure area developed. On September 19 it turned to the northeast, and on September 20 Dennis merged with an extratropical low.51


Tropical Depression Eleven


On September 14, a tropical depression developed about 490 miles (790 km) southeast of Antigua. Tracking westward at 5–10 mph (8–16 km/h), the depression maintained winds of about 35 mph (55 km/h), and was deemed &quot;no cause for alarm&quot; for the Lesser Antilles.5253 Failing to intensify further, the depression degenerated into a tropical wave on September 16 to the east of Antigua. No damage of fatalities were reported.54


Hurricane Emily


A tropical storm formed east of the Windward Islands and headed westward, later causing considerable damage on Saint Vincent.55 The cyclone then slowly began turning north, soon making landfall in the Dominican Republic, where three people were reported dead and there was $30 million (1987 US dollars) in damage. Emily passed over Hispaniola, turned to the northeast, and eventually made landfall in Bermuda, where it caused $35 million (1987 USD) in damage, though there were no fatalities.56 Thousands of migratory birds took refuge on Bermuda during the storm, including ten thousand bobolinks and thousands of Connecticut warblers. After the storm passed Bermuda, Emily became the fastest moving hurricane of the previous century, moving at a pace of  or 31 m/s.
Emily was the first hurricane in the Caribbean Sea since Hurricane Katrina of the 1981 Atlantic hurricane season.57


Hurricane Floyd


A broad area of low pressure organized into a tropical depression off the coast of Nicaragua on October 9. After drifting to the southeast, it turned to the north-northwest and organized into a tropical storm on October 10. After crossing western Cuba, Floyd accelerated to the northeast, and attained hurricane status late on October 12. It passed through the Florida Keys before entraining cooler, drier air from a stationary frontal boundary.58 Its convection became very disorganized, and Floyd weakened back to a tropical storm early on October 13 to the southeast of Miami; the storm crossed the Bahamas, and becoming an extratropical cyclone before being absorbed by the frontal boundary on October 14.59
Damage in Florida was minimal, due to the disorganized nature of the hurricane. Floyd brought up to 10.07 inches to the state, causing moderate crop damage in the southern portion of the state.6061 In addition, a tornado spawned by the storm damaged portions of the Florida Keys. Overall damage amounted to around $500,000 (1987 USD), with no casualties or injuries reported.62


Tropical Depression Fourteen



A broad area of low pressure existed in the central Caribbean Sea in late October. It steadily organized, and was classified as Tropical Depression Fourteen on October 31. It moved northwestward, and entered a high-shear environment due to an upper level low situated toward the end of a high pressure system. By November 1, little convection remained as the weak depression turned to the north and crossed Cuba. A burst of convection organized over the depression, and brought strong wind gusts to the Florida Keys as it passed through the area on the 2nd.63 It continued to the north-northwest, paralleling the Florida west coast, and lost all of its convection on the 3rd. The system turned to the northeast, and merged with a weak extratropical low over northern Florida on the 4th.64
While passing to the west of Jamaica, the depression dropped heavy rainfall, with a three-day peak of 10.21 inches (25.93 mm at Kingston, and a peak daily rainfall total of 6.38 inches (16.21 mm) on November 1.65 According to an unofficial report, the flooding caused six fatalities in Jamaica.66 Cuba reported moderate rainfall, peaking at 4.75 inches (12.07 mm) in Bah&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Honda the province of Pinar del R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o.67 Despite being a weak system, the depression also dropped moderate precipitation across Florida, peaking at 10.23 inches (26 mm) at Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. Rainfall was experienced as far north as eastern Georgia and extreme southern South Carolina.68

The table on the right shows the ACE for each storm in the season. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength.
