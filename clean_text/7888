Carol Martha Browner (born December 16, 1955) is an American lawyer, environmentalist, and businesswoman, who serves as director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy in the Obama administration. Browner previously served as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency during the Clinton administration.
Browner grew up in Florida and graduated from the University of Florida and the University of Florida College of Law. After working for the Florida House of Representatives, she was employed by Citizen Action in Washington, D.C. She became a legislative assistant for Senators Lawton Chiles and Al Gore. Browner then headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993, where she turned it into one of the most active departments in the state government.
She was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the EPA, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency. During her tenure, she reorganized the agency's enforcement structure and oversaw two new programs designed to create flexible partnerships with industry as an alternative to traditional regulation. She started a successful program to deal with contaminated lands in urban areas. She took the lead within the administration in defending existing environmental laws and budgets, and was the driving force behind a stringent tightening of air quality standards that led to a prolonged political and legal battle. Afterward, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group and Albright Capital Management during the 2000s. She also served on a number of boards of directors and committees dealing with environmental issues. She assumed her new post in the Obama administration in January 2009.
Early life and education
Born in Miami, Florida,1 Browner is the daughter of Isabella Harty-Hugues and Michael Browner, both of whom were professors at Miami Dade Community College, in social science and English respectively.2 She has two younger sisters.3 Browner grew up in South Miami,4 and her hikes in the nearby Everglades &lt;U+2013&gt; only a bicycle ride away from her house5 &lt;U+2013&gt; gave her a close connection to the natural world:67 &quot;I was very shaped by growing up in that kind of environment where nature was right there.&quot;8
Browner received her B.A. degree from the University of Florida in 1977, majoring in English.910 She then graduated from the University of Florida College of Law with a J.D. degree in 1979.1112
Early career
During 1980 and 1981, Browner worked as General Counsel for the Florida House of Representatives Committee on Government Operations.13 There she helped revise Florida's Conservation and Recreational Lands Program.14 In 1983, she moved to Washington, D.C. and worked as associate director for the national Citizen Action group, a grassroots lobbying organization that was active in environmental issues.1516
Browner met Michael Podhorzer, a specialist in health-care issues at Citizen Action,17 in 1983.18 They married in 198719 and lived in Takoma Park, Maryland.20 They have a son, Zachary, born in 1987.2122
Between 1986 and 1988, Browner served as chief legislative assistant to Democratic U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles from Florida.23 In that role, she worked on a complex negotiation to expand Florida's Big Cypress National Preserve2425 as well as on a ban on offshore drilling nearby the Florida Keys.26 During 1989, she served as a legal counsel for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.27 She was not averse to in-field investigation, and once dived in coastal waters to do research while pregnant.28
From 1988 to 1991, Browner worked as legislative director for Senator Al Gore,29 and became known as a Gore proteg&lt;U+00E9&gt;.3031 She helped prepare amendments to the Clean Air Act32 and managed Gore's legislative staff.33
Secretary of Environmental Regulation for Florida
As Secretary of Environmental Regulation,34 Browner headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993,35 while living in Tallahassee.36 It was the nation's third-largest such state agency, with 1,500 employees and a budget of some $650 million.37 There she believed that economic development and environmental protection did not have to be in conflict with each other.38 She revitalized the demoralized department and turned it into one of the most active in the Florida state government.39 She shortened the amount of time it took the department to review development permits for wetlands-affected areas and for manufacturing plants; in doing so, she annoyed some environmentalists who thought that the streamlined procedures diminished public review.40
Browner pushed for the halting of construction of new hazardous waste plants and municipal waste incinerators, on the grounds that health and environment consequences were insufficiently known.41 She brokered a deal with Walt Disney World that would allow it to build on wetlands it owned, in exchange for $40 million of work by Disney to restore endangered wetlands nearby.42 She pleased environmentalists by persuading Chiles, who had become governor, to negotiate a settlement to a federal lawsuit regarding damage to Everglades National Park and forcing the Florida sugar industry to bear much of the $1 billion cost.43 The head of Florida's largest business trade association described dealing with Browner: &quot;She kicks the door open, throws in a hand grenade, and then walks in to shoot who's left. She really doesn't like to compromise. [But she] has done a pretty good job down here. People have more complaints with the way she does it than what she does.&quot;44
EPA Administrator
Nomination and confirmation
After the 1992 presidential election, Browner served as transition director for Vice President-elect Gore.45 President-elect Bill Clinton announced her as his choice for Environmental Protection Agency head on December 11, 1992.46 While both Clinton and Gore had criticized the George H. W. Bush administration's commitment to environmental protection during the campaign,47 the selection of Browner &lt;U+2013&gt; who was described by The Washington Post as having &quot;the mind and training of an attorney-legislator but the soul of an activist&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; was seen as an indication that Gore's ardent environmentalism had won out over Clinton's more pro-business mindset.48 Clinton later wrote that he had not known her, but that Chiles had recommended her highly and Gore had requested she be named.49 The pick, along with several others of Gore prot&lt;U+00E9&gt;g&lt;U+00E9&gt;s that Clinton made, helped solidify the vice president's position within the administration.50 At her confirmation hearings before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to Gore.51 She was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the United States Senate on January 21, 1993.52
She and Podhorzer returned to Takoma Park, Maryland, and he continued to work at Citizen Action.53 Her long-term goal was &quot;to leave the world a slightly better place,&quot; and she practiced various environmentally beneficial practices at home.54 She avoided the Nannygate problems of some of Clinton's other early female nominees by having never used a nanny.55 She continued to lead an active outdoor life via bicycling, skiing, and jogging.56
First four years
 At the EPA, Browner supervised some 17,000 employees and a $7 billion budget.57 Early in her administration, she angered some EPA employees by publicly stating that the organization lacked management accountability and discipline and was wasting taxpayer money.58 Soon after taking office, Browner and her top aides, including assistant administrator for enforcement Steven Herman, reorganized several awkward and inefficient agency enforcement structures into a single Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.59 The EPA's regional offices were permitted flexibility in reworking their own enforcement structures, however, which led to some bureaucratic conflicts.60
Browner found criticism from both sides of environmental issues61 and battled many environmentalists, who objected to her support for repeal of the 1958 Delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods.62 Her announcement in May 1993 that the EPA would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists, however.63 A move by Clinton to elevate the EPA and Browner to Cabinet-level status failed in late 1993 to gain sufficient Congressional support.6465 Many of her legislative desires had to take a back seat to the higher-priority 1993 Clinton health care plan.66
When the Republican Party took control of Congress after the 1994 U.S. elections, Browner took the lead for the Clinton administration in successfully fighting efforts by the Republicans, especially in the House of Representatives, to amend the Clean Water Act6768 and to rollback other environmental regulations.69 She was able to work in a bipartisan manner, though, with Republicans in helping craft amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and passage of the Food Quality Protection Act.70 During the budget-cutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in 1995, Browner successfully protected the EPA's review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over $750 million in increased spending for the agency.71 Her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent: &quot;an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right.&quot;72

Two initiatives begun by the Clinton administration under Browner's tenure were part of its &quot;reinventing government&quot; program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts as a way of expanding the EPA's flexible public-private partnerships, as an alternative to traditional regulation.73 Project XL in 1995 was designed to find common sense, cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities,74 while the Common Sense Initiative in 1994 was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors, rather than dealing with issues on a crisis-by-crisis, pollutant-by-pollutant basis.75 Project XL had mixed results, with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned.76 The more ambitious Common Sense Initiative, which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some European countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice, showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in 1998.7778
In March 1995, Browner and the EPA were charged by the House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs with violating the federal Anti-Lobbying Act (18 U.S. Code &lt;U+00A7&gt; 1913) by faxing unsolicited material opposing the Republican-sponsored regulatory reform package to various corporations and public-interest groups.7980 Browner denied the accusation, saying the charge was an attempt to keep her from debating a possible rollback of health and environmental protections.81
As EPA administrator, Browner started the agency's successful Brownfields Program in 1995.82 The program helped facilitate cleanups of brownfield lands and their contaminated facilities, especially in urban areas, by empowering states, communities, and assorted stakeholders in economic development.83 It leveraged more than $1 billion in public and private funds for cleanups and created thousands of new jobs, while enabling hundreds of communities to bring idle properties back into productive use.84
Second four years
Perhaps Browner's biggest triumph85 came in 1997, when she convinced Clinton to support a stringent tightening of the Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards regarding permissible levels of the ground-level ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot.8687 The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade.88 There was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration, with opposition from the president's economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said the costs of the new standards would far outweigh any benefits89 and that Browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the EPA's scientific reviews on the matter.9091 Over eighty environmental and health groups, who had grown quite frustrated with the administration's preference for minimal-cost incremental actions in the area, pressured Vice President Gore to take a stand on the matter, but he remained silent.92 Browner's adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost single-handedly, in private meetings, Congressional testimony, and public debate,93 and had come in the face of a silence from the White House that had put at risk her standing within the administration.94 Some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination.95 Ultimately, Gore lent behind-the-scenes support in favor of the new regulations, which was a key factor in Clinton's final decision in Browner's favor.96979899 Overall, the New York Times termed Browner's actions &quot;a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura&quot;100 and Time magazine labelled Browner the &quot;Queen of Clean Air&quot;.101 As the decision was announced, one which would affect hundreds of American cities and towns,102 Browner said: &quot;These new standards will provide new health protections to 125 million Americans, including 35 million children.&quot;103

FEMA head James Lee Witt and Administrator Browner worked with a HazMat team in Kinston, North Carolina during September 1999, in the wake of severe flooding from Hurricane Floyd.|alt=A group of eight middle-aged people surround the open back of a pickup truck that is carrying orange traffic cones and white food containers. The scene is next to a body of water and some trees and a telephone pole, on a blue sky sunny day. Three people are most prominent. One man is dressed in blue pants, and orange T-shirt from a hazardous materials team, and a blue and orange baseball cap. Another man is pointing at an unseen object, and is wearing blue jeans and a dark blue shirt, and has an air of authority about him. A woman is standing next to that man, listening. She is wearing black pants, a white shirt, and has brown hair cut above and down behind the ear and is wearing a thin black wristwatch.

The change to the standards had to survive Congressional review, but the support of Republicans from the northeast, especially New York Senator Al D'Amato, helped compensate for Democrats opposed to them.104105 The new regulations were challenged in the courts by industry groups as a violation of the U.S. Constitution's nondelegation principle and eventually landed in the U.S. Supreme Court,106 whose 2001 unanimous ruling in the case now titled Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc. largely upheld Browner's and the EPA's actions.107 Browner and the EPA also took action against air pollution caused by motor vehicles, issuing standards in 1999 that for the first time included light trucks and sport utility vehicles to meet the same emission standards as cars, and that would require the sulfur content of gasoline to be reduced by 90 percent over five years.108109
During her tenure, Browner also began efforts to deal with global warming, giving the EPA authority to regulate carbon emissions causing climate change, although the EPA under the following George W. Bush administration chose not to use that authority.110 Several other policies of hers were reversed in the Bush administration as well.111
During Browner's tenure, there were many reports from African American employees of racism directed at them from a network of &quot;good old boys&quot; who dominated the agency's middle management.112 The most known of these reports involved policy specialist Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, who in 1997 filed suit against the agency; in 2000, the court found the EPA guilty of discrimination against Coleman-Adebayo, and awarded her $300,000.113114 Coleman-Adebayo said that Browner allowed the problems to persist rather than trying to clean them up.115 In an October 2000 Congressional hearing on the matter,116 Browner emphasized that minorities had tripled in number in the agency's senior rank during her time as administrator, but was unable to explain why the culprits in Coleman-Adebayo's case had not been dismissed and in some cases had been promoted.117 Congressional dissatisfaction with the situation and the EPA's treatment of Coleman-Adebayo led to passage of the No-FEAR Act in 2002, which prohibits federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation.118
In the final days of the Clinton administration, D.C. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered the EPA to preserve under the Freedom of Information Act all documents possibly relevant to last-minute EPA regulation issuances.119 In 2003, Lamberth found the EPA in contempt for not having preserved Browner's files, but did not find Browner or other officials in contempt.120 Browner had said that she had not been aware of the court order and that the computer material she had removed was not work-related.121
During her EPA tenure, Browner became unpopular with a number of industry groups, especially utilities and heavy manufacturing, as well as with conservatives in Congress, who thought businesses were stifled by her policies.122123124 She also battled the Treasury Department at times, and sometimes opposed Clinton himself, who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations.125 Nonetheless, Browner was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the agency, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency.126127 Robert W. Collin, author of a 2005 text on the agency, assessed her as &quot;one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the EPA,&quot; and wrote that she was &quot;completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues.&quot;128 Clinton himself later stated that Browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements.129
Business career
After the Clinton administration, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group, a &quot;global strategy group&quot; headed by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.130 As a principal, Browner assisted businesses and other organizations with the challenges of operating internationally, including complying with environmental regulations and climate change. Coca-Cola and Merck &amp; Co. have been among the clients for such international assistance.131 She also became a founding member and principal of Albright Capital Management, an investment advisory company.132133 During 2002, she taught classes at the study abroad program of her alma mater, now named the Fredric G. Levin College of Law.134
Browner is now married to former Congressman Thomas Downey. The marriage, his second, her third,135 took place on June 21, 2007, in Riverhead, New York.136 Downey heads a lobbying firm representing clients in the energy industry.137 In 2006, she and Downey collaborated on behalf of Dubai Ports World, but were unable to persuade Senator Charles Schumer to their viewpoint during the Dubai Ports World controversy.138

She has brown hair around the ear down to her shoulder, and is wearing a salmon-colored suit jacket with a double-strand of some kind of necklace. A balding, middle-aged man and a stack of some papers can be seen behind her.

Browner joined the board of the National Audubon Society in 2001 and became chair in 2003;139 her term expired in 2008.140 She also joined the board of the Alliance for Climate Protection, an organization founded by Gore in 2006.141 In 2008, she joined the board of APX, Inc., which specializes in technology infrastructure for the environmental commodities markets142 including those for carbon offsets and the CDM Gold Standard.143 She was also on the boards of the Center for American Progress, the Alliance for Climate Protection, and the League of Conservation Voters.144 She left all of these boards in late 2008 when she was named to serve in the Obama administration.145 Until summer 2008 she was a member of Socialist International's Commission for a Sustainable World Society,146147148 although the commission's web site still had her listed as a member in January 2009.149
Her income in 2008 was between $1 million and $5 million from lobbying firm Downey McGrath Group, where her husband was a principal.150 She also reported $450,000 in &quot;member distribution&quot; income, plus retirement and other benefits from the Albright Group.151
Browner retained a political voice during her business career, describing the George W. Bush administration as &quot;the worst environmental administration ever.&quot;152 She also stated that global warming is &quot;the greatest challenge ever faced&quot;.153 In the 2008 presidential election, she was a strong supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton's bid for the Democratic nomination.154 After Clinton lost her bid, Browner campaigned for Barack Obama in several battleground states and in League of Conservation Voters events.155
Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy
 On November 5, 2008, Browner was named to the advisory board of the Obama-Biden Transition Project.156
On December 15, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama named Browner as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change.157 Officially known as the Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy,158159 she acts as a coordinator for environmental, energy, climate, transport and related matters for the federal government.160 Her position is sometimes informally described as the &quot;Energy Czar&quot; or the &quot;Climate Czar&quot;.161162163 It did not require Senate confirmation.164 Her participation on the Commission for a Sustainable World Society drew criticism from some Republican members of Congress,165 but the Obama transition team said there was nothing wrong with it.166 In any case, her power and influence rely primarily on persuasion: &quot;I don't have any independent policymaking authority. It's not like when I was at EPA and I could depend on regulation.&quot;167 Browner's deputy assistant is Heather Zichal,168 a former legislative director for Senator John Kerry.169
The early months of the Obama administration found her working well with the Cabinet members.170 She was a key negotiator between the administration and automakers in formulating the new United States emission standards in May 2009,171172 and also was a member of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry that bailed out American automakers.173 She has been a central player in negotiation with Congress of the United States Carbon Cap and Trade Program, seemingly more so than U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu,174175 and continued to stress its importance despite the Obama health care plan being the top legislative priority overall.176 By September 2009, Republican members of Congress expressed concern that her access to the president had usurped power from other agencies.177 She also became a brief target of fervent anti-&quot;czar&quot; radio and television commentator Glenn Beck, following the Van Jones resignation.178

Browner briefed President Obama and Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett on the BP oil spill on June 1, 2010.|alt=A pale-skinned woman in her fifties is sitting on a beige sofa in a large room with a window, a painting, and a bureau visible in the background. She has straight, tan-brown hair over her ears and down to her shoulder and is wearing a brown suit with a pale blue bracelet. She is gesturing with her hands and has a pen and a tablet of paper next to her. To one side of her is a light-brown-skinned woman in her fifties with brown hair, wearing a light-and-dark-grey suit and looking at the first woman. She is holding a pen and a writing pad is next to her as well. On the other side of the first woman is the out-of-focus image of the back of the head and shoulders and arm of a brown-skinned man with dark hair. He is looking at the first woman and holding his right hand to his temple, as if in pain or concentration.

In October 2009, Browner conceded that congressional passage of the cap-and-trade legislation before the end of year was unlikely, and feared its absence would harm prospects for meaningful international agreement at the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference in December.179 By the next month, she moderated her concern, but expressed opposition to any congressional &quot;slicing and dicing&quot; that would separate energy and climate concerns.180 Attempts to pass any kind of climate legislation collapsed in July 2010 due to lack of enough votes in the Senate; Browner appeared on behalf of the administration and said, &quot;Obviously, everyone is disappointed that we do not yet have an agreement on comprehensive legislation.&quot;181
In 2010, Browner became one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.182 In late May 2010 she assessed the spill as &quot;probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country&quot; and said that the administration was &quot;prepared for the worst&quot;.183 She added that &quot;I think what the American people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until August, when the relief wells will be finished.&quot;184
Awards and honors
In April 1997, Browner received the Outstanding Mother of the Year Award from the National Mother's Day Committee &quot;for her dedication to providing 'children with a safer, healthier world.'&quot;185186 Browner also has received Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year Award, the Ambulatory Pediatric Association's Advocate for Children Award, the South Florida Chapter of the Audubon Society's Guy M. Bradley Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Lifetime Environmental Achievement Award from the New York State Bar Association.187188 In 1998 she received Vice President Gore's Hammer Award for helping to make government cost less and work better.189 In 2000, she received the American Lung Association's President's Award for leadership towards &quot;the toughest action in a generation to safeguard public health from the threats posed by air pollution.&quot;190
