Samuel Levi Tomkins (born 23 March 1989) is an English professional rugby league footballer who plays for the Wigan Warriors in Super League.
Tomkins was born in Milton Keynes. After his family moved north in the early 1990s, he started playing for the Chorley Panthers amateur club when he was aged seven. In order to develop his career further, Tomkins' family moved to Wigan where he played for Wigan St. Patricks, before receiving a scholarship from the Wigan Warriors with whom he signed a full-time contract at the end of 2007. In 2008 he played for Wigan Warriors in the Challenge Cup, becoming the first rugby league player to score five tries in a first-grade debut. He is the younger brother of Joel Tomkins, another rugby league footballer playing for the Wigan Warriors.
2009 would prove to be Tomkins' breakthrough year. He made his league debut against Harlequins RL and made 27 appearances during the season, scoring 15 tries. He established himself as Wigan's first choice stand-off, and was named in the Super League Dream Team, as well as receiving the club's own Player of the Year and the Super League's Young Player of the Year awards. In 2010, Tomkins switched from stand-off to fullback under Wigan's new head coach Michael Maguire, also appearing occasionally at scrum-half. That season, Wigan won its first league title since 1998; it was Tomkins' first honour as a player. Appearing in every game of Wigan's 2010 season, he retained his place in the Dream Team, and also received the Rugby League International Federation's Rookie of the Year award.
Tomkins scored a hat-trick against Wales during his international debut, and appeared a further three times for England in 2009 at the Four Nations, in which he played in the tournament's final. In a Test match mid-way through the 2010 season, Tomkins equalled the record for most tries scored in a single match by an England player when he scored four against France. In the Four Nations later that year, Tomkins appeared in all three of England's matches as the team failed to progress past the first round. He also participated for England in the inaugural International Origin against the Exiles in 2011.
Early life
Tomkins was born on 23 March 1989 in Milton Keynes, England.1 Following the birth of Sam's older brother Joel in Warrington, the family had moved to Milton Keynes due to his father's work as a police officer.2 In the early 1990s, his family relocated to Chorley, where his younger brother Logan was born.3 Tomkins' first experience of rugby league came when he was seven years old, after his father introduced both Sam and Joel to the Chorley Panthers amateur club.4
By the time Tomkins was nine, both him and his older brother had moved from the Panthers and were becoming more involved with the amateur Wigan St. Patricks club, a feeder team for the professional Wigan Warriors club.56 To aid their careers, the family decided to move from Chorley to Wigan, and Tomkins remained playing at the club until his mid-teens.7 Reflecting on Tomkins' time at Wigan St. Patricks, Bill Atherton, the club's chairman, remarked that &quot;you could see there was something special when Sam came up through the club. There has always been something different about him.&quot;8 When he was aged twelve, he obtained a place on the Wigan Warriors scholarship scheme, and when he turned sixteen, Tomkins was offered a part-time contract for the club's academy.9 By 2007, Tomkins was featuring regularly for the Warriors' academy sides. That year, he featured in an under-18s win for the England Academy against France Cadets; his early try helped establish an early England lead before he completed his brace in the second half after a sin-binning for a high tackle.10 At the end of the year, Wigan rewarded Tomkins with a full-time contract, giving him the opportunity to train alongside players in the club's first team.11
Club career
Debut season
When Wigan agreed to release the stand-off Trent Barrett from his contract, the club looked to find a long-term replacement. Tomkins was offered a one-year extension to his own contract, which would keep him at the club until the end of the 2010 season with another year optional.1213 After signing the extension, Wigan head coach Brian Noble commented that Tomkins, along with Wigan teammate Mark Flanagan, &quot;both have the ability to make an impact in Super League in years to come.&quot;14 
A pre-season unofficial friendly match provided Tomkins his first experience against top-flight opposition as he came off the bench during Lee Briers' testimonial match in a 30&lt;U+2013&gt;22 loss to Warrington Wolves.15 Noble followed this up by providing Tomkins, aged 19, with his first team debut on 12 May against Whitehaven RLFC in a fifth round Challenge Cup match.16 Tomkins became the first player in rugby league history to score five tries on his first-grade debut, scoring his first three to complete a hat-trick within the first twelve minutes, as the Warriors scored eighteen tries in total on the way to a 106&lt;U+2013&gt;8 victory.17
Despite this, Thomas Leuluai replaced Tomkins for the team's next match against Warrington, meaning Tomkins would have to wait for his Super League debut.18 He played out the rest of the 2008 season in the reserves, some of his highlights including a hat-trick against Castleford Tigers and another five-try performance against Harlequins RL.1920 After scoring four tries against Hull's reserves, Tomkins was tipped to make at least ten Super League appearances in 2009 season by Shaun Wane, Wigan's reserve coach.21 He also received an endorsement from Ian Lenagan, the club's chairman, when he said, &quot;I think Sam is going to be a world-class half-back and we want to give him his chance.&quot;22 Tomkins was named Reserve Team Player of the Year at the Wigan Warriors' inaugural awards evening.23
2009 season
The club played Warrington over the 2008 Christmas holidays, as a pre-season friendly to Wigan's 2009 season. Tomkins claimed a hat-trick as the team swept aside a young and inexperienced Warrington side 44&lt;U+2013&gt;4.24 Tomkins also featured in the club's two other fixtures during the pre-season, firstly against Huddersfield Giants and then against Leigh Centurions.2526 For 2009, Tomkins was given the number 25 shirt.27  Wigan faced their worst start to a season since 1966 after losing their opening three matches.28 Tomkins was brought into the squad and came off the bench against Harlequins for his league debut during their fourth match of the season. Tomkins made a break early in the second half which allowed George Carmont to claim the equalising try.29 Tomkins took Tim Smith's starting place in the team for their next match against Bradford Bulls.30 After scoring twice for a brace against Salford City Reds, he earned his first league tries.31 He also scored in a fourth round cup match against Barrow Raiders.32 For the round 10 fixture against Celtic Crusaders, Tomkins was relegated to the bench as Smith made his first start in eight games. However Tomkins came on as an interchange to score his second brace of the season.33
He also scored the final try of the match in Wigan's fifth round cup win over Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, and although he was found guilty on a charge of kicking out in the tackle against another player, he escaped a match ban.3435 With Smith expressing his desire to return home to Australia following the 2009 season, Tomkins was tipped by Lenagan as Wigan's long-term replacement at stand-off.36 Tomkins was named in a train-on squad for England's friendly test match against France, although he did not play.37 He was dropped in round 15 for Wigan's match against Salford, but returned off the bench and scored against Hull Kingston Rovers in round 18.3839 Tomkins played every game for the Warriors thereafter, except for the final regular round fixture of the season against Huddersfield, until the team were knocked out of the Super League play-offs by St. Helens RLFC.40 Included in this run of appearances was a hat-trick and Tomkins' first drop goal against Castleford Tigers in round 25.  In the same year he made his league debut, Tomkins was named in the Super League Dream Team at stand-off, and was also voted by journalists in the Rugby League Writers' Association as Super League Young Player of the Year.4142 At the Wigan Warriors' own awards evening, he was named Player of the Year and Young Player of the Year.43 Tomkins would go on to play for England during the 2009 Four Nations. He ended the domestic season with twenty-seven first-grade appearances, twenty-three of which in the league, as well as fifteen tries.444546 In doing this, Tomkins had more than doubled the estimation of ten league games made by Wane during the previous season. He was given a five-year contract from the club.47
2010 season
Following the play-off loss to St. Helens, Noble announced his departure from the club after not being offered a new contract, and five days later Michael Maguire was revealed as the new head coach of Wigan Warriors.4849 In Maguire's 2010 squad, Tomkins' position as Wigan's first choice stand-off was confirmed when he received the #6 shirt from the departed Smith.50 The club also signed Wigan-born Paul Deacon during the pre-season, with the intention of having him mentor Tomkins in an assistant coaching role.51
Tomkins played in every match of Wigan's 2010 season. He started in three cup matches, scoring hat-tricks against Sheffield Eagles and Widnes Vikings.52535455 He also featured in all of Wigan's fixtures of the Super League XV regular season, with the team finishing top of the league table and winning the League Leader's Shield.56575859 By virtue of this the team qualified for the play-offs, in which Tomkins made a further four appearances on the way to Wigan's Grand Final victory over St. Helens&lt;U+2014&gt;the club's first league title since 1998 and Tomkins' first honour as a player.60616263
Tomkins was played at scrum-half for the Warriors' round 12 fixture against Harlequins with Sean O'Loughlin covering his position at stand-off instead.64 In round 15, again against Harlequins, Tomkins marked his first league appearance as a fullback with the game's first score and a try-saving tackle on Lamont Bryan. The Daily Mirror reported Maguire as saying, &quot;Sam wanted a go at fullback and played very well. He's a quality kid in any position.&quot;65 He remained in that position for the rest of the season, including the Grand Final, except for one match against Warrington in round 22 where he was reverted to stand-off again.66
Over 34 total appearances, Tomkins improved on his 2009 record with 21 tries and four goals.6768 In the league, he claimed four braces in total: once as a stand-off against Hull, and three times as a fullback against Salford, Hull again and Leeds Rhinos.69707172 He also scored a try during the Grand Final against St. Helens.73 Despite finishing the season as Wigan's regular fullback, Tomkins maintained his place in the 2010 Super League Dream Team in the stand-off position. Also in the team was Joel Tomkins at second-row. This was the first time a Super League Dream Team had featured two brothers.74 At the Super League XV awards evening, where his Wigan teammate Pat Richards was voted by his fellow Super League players as Man of Steel for having the biggest impact on the season, Tomkins retained his Young Player of the Year title.75 He also received 2010's Albert Goldthorpe Medal for 'best and fairest' player of the season. He was also named Rookie of the Year by the Rugby League International Federation during the 2010 Four Nations, in which he played for England.76
2011 season
The previous season's transition to fullback was made permanent by the club when Tomkins inherited the #1 shirt from Cameron Phelps, whose 2010 season was blighted by injury and was not offered a new contract.7778 With speculation that Tomkins might move to the National Rugby League or switch codes to rugby union, Wigan offered him a new five-year contract keeping him at the club until the end of the 2015 season.79  Tomkins made 34 appearances during the 2011 season: 28 in the Super League, 5 in the Challenge Cup, and one in the World Club Challenge, in which he scored a drop goal in Wigan's 15&lt;U+2013&gt;21 loss to the St. George Illawarra Dragons.80818283 Tomkins received a match ban in round 6, for joining a fight in the previous match against Hull, meaning that for the first time since the final regular round fixture against Huddersfield in 2009, he missed a first-grade match.8485 Due to his involvement for England in the inaugural International Origin against the Exiles, he was also rested for Wigan's away game against Castleford.86
His scoring record in 2011 started in the opening round against St. Helens in which he kicked a goal but missed a drop goal which would have won the game for Wigan.87 His first try came during Wigan's next game at Bradford.88 A match-tying penalty kicked by Tomkins salvaged a draw for Wigan against Leeds.89 From 25 April to 4 June, Tomkins scored thirteen tries in seven games for the Warriors, including braces against Crusaders and Harlequins in the league and Barrow in the cup, as well as a hat-trick against Hull Kingston Rovers.90919293 He scored his second hat-trick of the season against Huddersfield, taking his career total to six.94 In Wigan's fifth round cup win over Bradford, Gareth Raynor's high tackle left Tomkins unconscious as he was scoring a try, an incident which ended both Raynor's and Tomkins' involvement in the match due to a sending-off and a head injury respectively.95 Despite missing part of Wigan's away match to Hull because of a shoulder injury, Tomkins returned from the bench and scored two tries in a 16&lt;U+2013&gt;30 victory; after the match, Sky Sports reported that he had become a &quot;strong favourite&quot; for the season's Man of Steel award.9697 He followed this up a week later with a try-scoring man of the match performance against St. Helens as Wigan won their first cup semifinal since 2004.9899 Wigan returned to league action with a win at home to Salford, with Tomkins scoring four tries.100 He scored another brace against Bradford in Wigan's last match before the Challenge Cup final.101 Tomkins played in that final as part of a victorious Wigan team, giving Tomkins his first Challenge Cup honour, although Jeff Lima was given the Lance Todd Trophy award which Tomkins had been pre-match favourite to win.102103104 After the final, the Rugby Football League investigated and found Tomkins guilty of an obscene gesture aimed at fans of the opposing Leeds team, for which he was given a suspended GBP&lt;U+00A3&gt;1,000 fine.105106 His points tally for Wigan's season totalled 32 tries, five goals, and one drop goal.107108109
Representative career
In the 2008 World Cup, co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand, England's campaign ended with a 32&lt;U+2013&gt;22 loss to New Zealand at the semi-final stage.110 England responded to their exit from the tournament by replacing a number of veterans with younger players for the 2009 Four Nations.111 Tomkins, who was then playing at stand-off for Wigan, was included in a new-look squad which featured a quarter of its players aged 21 or below.112  On 18 October 2009, having played less than thirty games for Wigan, Tomkins made his international debut for Tony Smith's England team against Wales at Brewery Field in a warm-up match for the Four Nations tournament.113 The then-twenty year old scored a hat-trick in a 12&lt;U+2013&gt;48 victory, with Iestyn Harris, the Welsh head coach and former cross-code test international, praising Tomkins' contribution to the winning England team.114 Despite this, Tomkins was left out of the squad that faced France in the opening Four Nations fixture.115 He replaced Richie Myler for England's defeat against Australia at Wigan's DW Stadium, with an impressed Darren Lockyer, the Australian captain, stating after the match, &quot;To be honest, we didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t really know their young fellas. We do now.&quot;116117118 With Smith showing confidence in the young half-back pairing between Kyle Eastmond, Tomkins maintained his place in the squad which won their must-win match against New Zealand for a place in the tournament final.119120 The hosting England side, playing at Elland Road in Leeds, were overcome by Australia in the closing thirty minutes of the final despite leading 16&lt;U+2013&gt;14 at one point, although the pairing between Eastmond and Tomkins was, according to Sky Sports, impressive.121
Smith resigned as England coach following the Four Nations, with Steve McNamara announced as the team's new head coach.122123 Tomkins kept his place in the England team when they played France in a mid-season friendly, and he responded by scoring four tries on England's way to a 60&lt;U+2013&gt;6 win, a record-equalling tally for an England player in a single match.124 Tomkins appeared in all three of England's matches at the 2010 Four Nations, firstly in a defeat to New Zealand where a Kevin Brown try scored from a Tomkins kick was disallowed by the video referee due to Tomkins pushing Greg Eastwood in the process.125 Another comprehensive defeat to Australia ended England's hopes of reaching the final, in a match where Tomkins made his first international switch from the halves to fullback.126 He stayed in this position for England's final match against Papua New Guinea, a 36&lt;U+2013&gt;10 victory in which Tony Clubb equalled Tomkins' four-try record.127
While playing for England during the inaugural International Origin, which England lost thanks to Wigan teammate George Carmont's 79th minute try for the Exiles, Sam was booed by England supporters from opposing clubs within the Headingley crowd at Leeds.128 The incident was criticised as &quot;disgraceful&quot;129 by Jamie Peacock, the England captain and Leeds Rhinos forward, however Wigan head coach Michael Maguire claimed Tomkins had not been affected by the abuse.130
In England's opening match of the 2011 Four Nations against Wales, Tomkins scored four tries, which for the second time in his international career equalled the record for the most tries by a player representing England. On this occasion, the match was a full Test.131
