The Kendall Cottage is a historic house on Silver Lake Road in Harrisville, New Hampshire. The main (left side) portion of the 1 1/2 story Cape style house was built in 1798; the right-hand portion, a near copy of the left side, was added c. 1930. The house is one of a few surviving vernacular hill farm houses in Harrisville; it was also the home of one the town's first selectmen.1
The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.2
