Hadropithecus is a medium-sized, extinct genus of lemur, or strepsirrhine primate, from Madagascar that includes a single species, Hadropithecus stenognathus. Both it and Archaeolemur are collectively known as &quot;monkey lemurs&quot; or &quot;baboon lemurs&quot; due to body plans and dentition that suggest a terrestrial lifestyle and a diet similar to that of modern baboons. Hadropithecus had extended molars and a short, powerful jaw, suggesting that it was both a grazer and a seed predator.
The monkey lemurs are considered to be most closely related to the living indrids and the recently extinct sloth lemurs, although recent finds have caused some dispute. Hadropithecus lived in open habitat in the Central Plateau, South, and Southwest regions of Madagascar. It is known only from subfossil or recent remains and is considered to be a modern form of Malagasy lemur. It died out around 444&lt;U+2013&gt;772 CE, shortly after the arrival of humans on the island.
Etymology
The common names that Hadropithecus shares with Archaeolemur, &quot;monkey lemurs&quot; and &quot;baboon lemurs&quot;, come from their dental and locomotor adaptations, which resemble that of modern African baboons.12 The genus Hadropithecus is derived from the Greek words hadros, meaning &quot;stout&quot; or &quot;large&quot;, and pithekos, meaning &quot;ape&quot;. The species name derives from the Greek root steno-, meaning &quot;narrow&quot;, and gnathos, meaning &quot;jaw&quot; or &quot;mouth&quot;.3 Therefore Hadropithecus stenognathus means &quot;Large ape with a narrow jaw&quot;, despite the fact that it is a large lemur, not an ape.
Classification and phylogeny

Hadropithecus is an extinct genus of lemur, or strepsirrhine primate, that includes a single species, Hadropithecus stenognathus. According to Linnaean taxonomy, it belongs to the family Archaeolemuridae, which in turn belongs to the infraorder Lemuriformes, which includes all the Malagasy lemurs.4
Originally thought to have been a sister group to the living indrids and the recently extinct sloth lemurs (family Palaeopropithecidae) because of similarities in their skull and teeth,56 there was some debate over whether the monkey lemurs (Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur) or the sloth lemurs were more closely related to today's indrids. The monkey lemurs had skulls that more closely resembled the indrids, but their teeth were very specialized and unlike those of the indrids. The sloth lemurs, on the other hand, had teeth like the indrids, but very specialized skulls. The matter was settled with the discovery of new skeletons of Babakotia and Mesopropithecus, two genera of sloth lemur, both of which had indrid-like skulls and teeth.7 More recently, there had been some debate over whether or not the monkey lemurs were more closely related to the lemurids based postcranial traits and other features shown in subfossil remains found in the first half of the 2000s .8 However, DNA sequencing has reaffirmed the sister group status of the monkey lemurs to indrids and sloth lemurs.9

Anatomy and physiology
Hadropithecus stenognathus has been estimated to have weighed between  and to be roughly the same size as Archaeolemur, although more gracile.1011 Newer subfossil finds, however, suggest that Hadropithecus may have been more robust, and more like a gorilla than a baboon.12 Both lemurs were quadrupedal (walked on four legs).13 There is no evidence of cursoriality (adaptations specifically for running) in either species.14
Although fewer post-cranial remains have been discovered for Hadropithecus compared to Archaeolemur, what has been found indicates that both were adapted for a terrestrial lifestyle, with short limbs and a powerful build.15 Due to its specialized dentition and likely diet, Hadropithecus is thought to have been the more terrestrial of the two.16 Both genera also have shortened hands and feet that have been described as almost &quot;paw-like.&quot;17 Hadropithecus had shorter metatarsals and limbs, as well as a broader thorax. Its phalanges were also more curved than those of baboons.18
The face of Hadropithecus was shortened and adapted to heavy stress from chewing. The monkey lemurs were known for their highly specialized teeth, but Hadropithecus went further by specializing in strong grinding.19 It had expanded molars that wore down quickly,20 much like those of ungulates,21 and its posterior premolars acted like molars to extend the grinding surface.22 It also had a robust mandible to facilitate crushing hard objects.23 Even the incisors and strepsirrhine toothcomb were reduced in this species.242526 Its dental formula was: 27
Ecology
Like all other lemurs, Hadropithecus was endemic to Madagascar. Because it died out only recently and is only known from subfossil remains, it is considered to be a modern form of Malagasy lemur.28 Formerly found only in the Central Plateau, South, and Southwest regions, it is thought to have been terrestrial or semi-terrestrial, an unusual trait for lemurs.29303132 Within its original range, there were few other lemurs to overlap its ecological niche, and it has been shown to be the only subfossil lemur to consume both C3 and C4 (or CAM) plants, an indication that it lived in more open habitats and had a varied diet.3334 Its physiology and dentition suggest that it was a lot like the Gelada Baboon in locomotion and diet.353637 It was probably a manual grazer and its teeth were well-adapted for grinding either grass or seeds.3839 Microwear patterns on its teeth, as well as its overly large molars, indicate it processed hard objects like nuts or seeds, making it a seed predator.4041
Extinction
Already considered a rare species due to the low number of subfossil finds,42 Hadropithecus died out sooner than its sister taxon, Archaeolemur.43 Both species disappeared shortly after the arrival of humans to the island, but being a large, specialized, terrestrial grazer, it would have faced more pressure from domestic livestock, introduced pigs, and spreading human populations than its more generalized cousin.44 It disappeared completely from Madagascar around 444&lt;U+2013&gt;772 CE.45
