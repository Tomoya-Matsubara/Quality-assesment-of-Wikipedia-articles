 Route 200 is a road that traverses the width of the Island of Hawai&lt;U+2018&gt;i, from downtown Hilo to its junction with State Route 190 near Waimea. The road is considered one of the most dangerous paved roads in the state, with many one-lane bridges and areas of marginally maintained pavement. It reaches a maximum height of 6,632 feet (2,021 metres) and is subject to fog and low visibility. Many rental car companies prohibit use of their cars on Saddle Road. Nevertheless, it provides the only access to the slopes of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa.
There are no highway shields posted along the entire route. The only indications that this is Route 200 are two shields on M&lt;U+0101&gt;malahoa Highway [190] marking the approaching junction and the small black-on-white plaques attached to the mile markers.

TOTAL MILES = 53.6 (86.3kM)

History
With the Attack on Pearl Harbor fresh in their memories, the U.S. Army hastily built an access road in 1942 to service their Pohak&lt;U+016B&gt;loa Training Area and Bradshaw Army Airfield in the Humu&lt;U+2018&gt;ula Highlands of Parker Ranch. Since it was not intended as a civilian road, the construction method was simple: clear, grade, pave. Military vehicles of all types and treads traversed the Island for the next three years.
Following the end of World War II in 1945, the Army turned over jurisdiction of the road to the Territory of Hawai&lt;U+2018&gt;i and was designated Route 20 but the territorial government had few funds to maintain the road, let alone upgrade it to civilian standards. The story was the same as the newly formed State of Hawai&lt;U+2018&gt;i took over jurisdiction in 1959. Saddle Road was subsequently handed to the County of Hawai&lt;U+2018&gt;i but little has ever been done to road with the exception of patching some of the more notorious potholes.
Wai&lt;U+2018&gt;&lt;U+0101&gt;nuenue Avenue
The MILE &lt;U+00D8&gt; marker is posted on the traffic signal at the intersection of Wai&lt;U+2018&gt;&lt;U+0101&gt;nenue Avenue, Kamehameha Avenue and Bayfront Highway. The route continues mauka along Wai&lt;U+2018&gt;&lt;U+0101&gt;nuenue Avenue to a little over a half-mile past the MILE 1 where it veers left onto Ka&lt;U+016B&gt;mana Drive near Gilbert Carvalho Park. Further along Wai&lt;U+2018&gt;&lt;U+0101&gt;nuenue Avenue is Rainbow Falls Park.

TOTAL MILES = 1.7 (2.7kM)

Ka&lt;U+016B&gt;mana Drive
Starting at the &lt;U+201C&gt;Y&lt;U+201D&gt; junction adjacent to Gilbert Carvalho Park, Highway 200 continues mauka on Ka&lt;U+016B&gt;mana Drive and provides access to many neighbourhoods overlooking Hilo. The road is quite narrow and windy with many blind corners, hidden driveways and open drainage ditches. Just past MILE 6 is the junction with P&lt;U+016B&gt;&lt;U+2018&gt;&lt;U+0101&gt;inak&lt;U+014D&gt; Street Extension [2000], completed in September 2004 as a bypass of the above-mentioned windy sections. The intersection with Ua Nahele Street at MILE 8 marks the mauka terminus of Ka&lt;U+016B&gt;mana Drive.

TOTAL MILES = 6.2 (9.9kM)

Saddle Road
The official start of Saddle Road is at the &lt;U+201C&gt;T&lt;U+201D&gt; intersection of Ua Nahele Street at MILE 8. This is the last neighbourhood through which the route will pass. As it has from its beginning in Hilo, Route 200 continues to climb towards the Humu&lt;U+2018&gt;ula Saddle between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa. The rainforest of the Hilo Forest Reserve and Upper Wai&lt;U+0101&gt;kea Forest Reserve surround the roadway and begin to thin as the elevation increases. Quality of the asphalt surface is quite good on this side of the crest but there are many curves and rises with limited visual distances.
The terrain becomes the high lava desert of the Humu&lt;U+2018&gt;ula Saddle. Two roads intersect Saddle Road close to Pu&lt;U+2018&gt;u Huluhulu at its crest near MILE 28 at 6,632 feet (2,021 metres) above sea level:

Mauna Loa Observatory Road is an unmarked 17.1 mile (27.5kM) long narrow rough road connects to Hilo-Kona Road (Tom Vance, who spearheaded several civil engineering projects on-Island, spent $1 million in 1949 to build a straight road on the Hilo-Kona alignment but work stopped a year later when the work camp caught fire one night and burned everything) then winds its way towards a number of scientific observatories on the slopes of Mauna Loa.
Mauna Kea Summit Road (a/k/a John A. Burns Way) provides access to Onizuka Center for International Astronomy (elevation 9,300ft / 2,835m) then climbs to the height of 13,780ft (4,200m) at grades averaging 17% making this the third highest public road in the United States; Pu&lt;U+2018&gt;u W&lt;U+0113&gt;kiu is the highest point in Hawai&lt;U+2018&gt;i at 13,796ft (4,208m) and is home to Poli&lt;U+2018&gt;ahu, Goddess of Snow. Many of the world's best observatories occupy the summit area and are under the jurisdiction of the University of Hawai&lt;U+2018&gt;i.

The new road alignment will start on the kona side of the Mauna Kea Summit Road junction. Until its completion, Route 200 will continue along the 1942 version of Saddle Road through the P&lt;U+014D&gt;hakuloa Training Area. Many conditions make this section of Route 200 hazardous: The road is a narrow ribbon of poorly-maintained pavement; there are several one-lane bridges; military vehicles &lt;U+2014&gt; including tanks &lt;U+2014&gt; occasionally cross or occupy the roadway; and oversized trucks delivering heavy equipment to the summit facilities. It is also common for drivers to negotiate the centre of the road to avoid the rough shoulders.
There is a sharp curve at MILE 25 adjacent to the entrance to Mauna Kea State Park (one of the few emergency telephones is located here). Saddle Road then passes the main gates to P&lt;U+014D&gt;hakuloa Training Area and Bradshaw Army Airfield before continuing across the Humu&lt;U+2018&gt;ula Saddle.
At the far end of the saddle, near MILE 35, Saddle Road climbs a steep grade to the Waiki&lt;U+2018&gt;i Crest before descending down the last ten miles (16.1kM) past the community of Waiki&lt;U+2018&gt;i Ranch. The terminus of Route 200 comes at its junction with M&lt;U+0101&gt;malahoa Highway [190] six miles (9.6kM) kona of Waimea.

TOTAL MILES = 45.7 (73.6kM)

Future plans
Construction is underway on a four-mile stretch mauka of the Army base, between MILE 24 and 28, which is scheduled for completion in early 2007. Also under way is a project to reroute part of Saddle Road now passing through the Army base, between MILE 28 and MILE 42, to a 12.7 mile-long new alignment at the foot of Mauna Kea. Part of the new roadway is expected to open to traffic by early 2007, with the remainder opening in 2008 (but remember, it took 34 years to complete the H3 on O&lt;U+2018&gt;ahu !).
Other realignment proposals include a section near Ka&lt;U+016B&gt;mana Country Club Estates as well as one that would bypass Waiki&lt;U+2018&gt;i and connect to M&lt;U+0101&gt;malahoa Highway at either MILE 15 or at the mauka terminus of Waik&lt;U+014D&gt;loa Road (in which case the Route 200 designation would be extended an additional twelve miles (19.3kM) to Queen Ka&lt;U+2018&gt;ahumanu Highway [19].
