Born to Make You Happy is a song by the American recording artist Britney Spears. The song was written and produced by Kristian Lundin and co-written by Andreas Carlsson for Spears' debut studio album, ...Baby One More Time 1999. The song was released on December 6, 1999 by Jive Records, as the fourth single from the album. The teen pop song, speaks of a relationship that a woman desires to correct, not quite understanding what went wrong, as she comes to realize that she was born to make her lover happy.

Born to Make You Happy received mixed reviews from music critics, with some calling it an early classic, but entirely an unremarkable song. It achieved commercial success, peaking inside the top-five in eleven countries. The lowest chart position for the single was in France, where it reached number nine. The song was certified Platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry IFPI in Sweden, for selling over 40,000 physical units of the single. It was also certified Gold by IFPI in IFPI Germany, Silver by the Syndicat National de l'dition Phonographique SNEP in Syndicat National de l'dition Phonographique France and by the British Phonographic Industry BPI in the British Phonographic Industry United Kingdom.

An accompanying music video, directed by Billie Woodruff, portrays Spears dreaming that she is with her lover, while she sings and dances during the majority of the video. Spears performed the song on four tours, including ...Baby One More Time Tour, where Spears sang the song seated on a staircase, ...Baby One More Time Tour Crazy 2k Tour, Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour, wearing pajamas and slippers, and Dream Within a Dream Tour, where Spears emerged from the middle of a giant musical box as a ballerina to perform the song in a medley with Lucky Britney Spears song Lucky and Sometimes Britney Spears song Sometimes.

I asked them to change the words to 'Born to Make You Happy.' It was a sexual song. ... I said, 'This may be a little old for me.' Because of the image thing, I don't want to go over the top. If I come out being Miss Prima donna Prima Donna, that wouldn't be smart. I want to have a place to grow.

Reception
Critical response
Born to Make You Happy received mixed reviews from music critics. Kyle Anderson of MTV considered the song's chorus more than a little bit off-putting, saying the first lines of it could be a sentiment that a lovelorn 16-year-old can understand, but it also sounds like Spears is in training to be a geisha. Craig MacInnis of Hamilton Spectator said Born to Make You Happy verge on the sort of boy-worshipping dreck that even Tiffany singer Tiffany would have sniffedat.citeweb url=http://travel.canoe.ca/AllPop-SpearsBritney/cd_baby1.html last=MacInnis first=Craig title=Bopper babe's CD glib collection of cliches date=January 12, 1999  publisher=Hamilton Spectator.
