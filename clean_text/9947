Critical reception

Simon Cage from the Daily Express gave the album three out of five stars and said that she &quot;has a winning way with ostentatious hats but Lady Gaga&lt;U+2019&gt;s true talent is actually selling the same album over and over again. [...] It&lt;U+2019&gt;s great but&lt;U+2026&gt; enough already!&quot;6 Music critic J. D. Considine, while reviewing the album for The Globe and Mail, complimented the piano and voice version of &quot;Poker Face&quot; and said, &quot;the smartest track on her newest remix album &lt;U+2013&gt; her second such album in nine months &lt;U+2013&gt; isn&lt;U+2019&gt;t a remix at all, but an unadorned piano-and-voice version of Poker Face that brings out her inner Elton John. And yes, this move, too, is probably just another bit of calculated image management, but that doesn&lt;U+2019&gt;t make it any less brilliant.&quot;7 Matthew Richardson from Prefix Magazine reviewed The Sound of Arrows remix of &quot;Alejandro&quot; and said that they &quot;have been releasing material in a slow trickle, but the quality has been such that people are still paying attention. While we're all waiting for their album to drop, hopefully sometime before the world ends, this remix that the duo did of Lady Gaga's &quot;Alejandro&quot; has recently surfaced. The laser house drought is over, for now.&quot;8 Robert Copsey from Digital Spy commented that &quot;The Remix feels like a fairly natural progression, as opposed to the cynical label cash-in often associated with this sort of release. What's more, it features input from a tasty mix of world-class knob-twiddlers and trendy up-and-comers, both of whom are as vital to keeping the singer's music fresh as her Haus Of GaGa designers are to her image.&quot;9
