History
Turnstone Press was founded in 1976 in Winnipeg to publish chapbooks by Manitoba poets. It is located in Western Canada. Turnstone Press publishes only Canadian authors or landed immigrants. Fifty percent of their content published each year is either written by Manitoba writers or contains content about Manitoba. Since its debut, Turnstone has grown to include fiction, literary criticism and literary non-fiction. In 1998 Turnstone expanded their business with Ravenstone imprint which specializes primarily in literary and experimental mystery and noir fiction.
To this day, they continue to publish new Canadian authors. Since their foundation they have began the careers of many Canadian authors which include Di Brandt, John Gould, Lawerence Hill, Sylvia Legris, Margaret Sweatman, and Armin Wiebe. Many of their authors and books have been nominated for numerous awards such as Governor General&lt;U+2019&gt;s Literary Awards, the Commonwealth Writer&lt;U+2019&gt;s Prize, The Giller Prize, the Leacock Price, IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, The Lambda Awards, The Rogers Trust Price, The Relit Awards, and numerous regional awards.
Awards
Several books and authors under Turnstone Press have been nominated for literary awards and have been recognized for their literary efforts. This list of awards include: Governor General's Literary Awards, the Commonwealth Writer's Prize, The Giller Prize, the Leacock Prize, IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, The Lambda Awards, The Rogers Trust Prize, The Relit Awards, and other regional awards.
Governor General&lt;U+2019&gt;s Literary Awards
&quot;The Governor General's Literary Awards (GGs) are given annually to the best English-language and the best French-language books in each of the seven categories of Fiction, Non-fiction, Poetry, Drama, Children's Literature (text), Children's Literature (illustration) and Translation (from French to English and English to French). The Canada Council funds, administers and promotes the GGs. The value of each award is $25,000 and each winner also receives a specially-bound copy of the winning book. The publisher of each winning book receives $3,000 to support promotional activities. Non-winning finalists each receives $1,000 in recognition of their selection as finalists, bringing the total value of the Awards close to $450,000. Committees of &lt;U+201C&gt;peers&lt;U+201D&gt; (writers, critics, and/or independent book professionals) review all eligible titles in each of the seven categories according to literary and artistic merit.&quot;1
Commonwealth Writers Prize
&quot;Established in 1987, the prize aims to recognise the best fiction by both established and new writers from Commonwealth countries and ensure these works reach a wider audience outside their countries of origin. Almost 200 books have now been recognised with prizes since the scheme began. The Prize aims to discover and promote up-and-coming and under-recognised writers, encourage dialogue and understanding of different cultures through reading, and share compelling stories of human experience. Chaired by Hon Nicholas Hasluck AM, the Prize is fully international in its character, administration and judging. Each year, prizes for Best Book and Best First Book are awarded in four regions: Africa, Caribbean and Canada, South Asia and Europe and South East Asia and Pacific. Eight regional winners then compete for the pan-Commonwealth Best Book and Best First Book prizes, of &lt;U+00A3&gt;10,000 and &lt;U+00A3&gt;5,000, awarded at a public programme held in a different Commonwealth country each year.&quot;2
Giller Prize
&quot;The Giller Prize was founded in 1994 by Jack Rabinovitch in honour of his late wife, literary journalist Doris Giller, who passed away from cancer the year before. The award recognized excellence in Canadian fiction - long format or short stories - and endowed a cash prize annually of $25,000.00, the largest purse for literature in the country. The launch of The Giller Prize coincided with a growing recognition of Canadian authors and literature both at home and abroad. With such acclaimed writers as Alice Munro, Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje and Mordecai Richler winning honours and accolades around the world, the popularity of Canadian literature has continued to flourish. The Giller Prize, along with many other awards that came before and after, is in large part responsible for this explosion of talent and exposure. More than 2.5 million Giller-nominated books were sold in the first 10 years of the prize. Over $60 million dollars in book sales to date have been generated as a direct result of the prize. The Giller Prize has so far endowed nearly half a million dollars to Canadian writers from coast to coast.&quot;3
The Leacock Prize
&quot;Close friends, colleagues and supporters of Stephen Leacock were the original members of the Leacock Associates (originally the Stephen Leacock Memorial Committee) when it was formed in 1946 under the guidance of Packet Editor, C. H. Hale. Membership was Orillia-based, but quickly spread through North America and England. The Association had three immediate objectives: to set up a collection in the Orillia Public Library of books, letters and personal items relating to the life and works of Stephen Leacock; to commission a bronze bust of Leacock by Elizabeth Wyn Wood, a famous Canadian sculptor and native of Orillia; and most notably to establish a memorial Medal to be awarded annually for the best book of humour written in the previous year by a Canadian.
The award has attained an international reputation and is the only award of its kind for Canadian humour.
Cash prizes to accompany the medal were offered beginning in the year 1970 in turn by the Manulife Insurance Company ($1,000) and by the Hudson's Bay Company ($1,500). In 1984, J. P. Wiser Distillers offered the J. P. Wiser cash award of $3,500 and in 1994, the Manulife Bank of Canada took over, offering a cash award of $5,000. In 1995, the Laurentian Bank of Canada became the award sponsor maintaining the cash award of $5,000 to the winner. This was increased to $10,000 for the year 2002. In 2004 the Laurentian Bank was purchased by Toronto Dominion, and the T.D. Financial Group took over sponsorship of the $10,000 cash award.&quot;4
IMPAC Dublin Literary Award
&quot;The International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award was established by Dublin City, Civic Charter in 1994. It arose from an initiative of Dublin Corporation, the Municipal Government of Dublin City on the instigation of the then Lord Mayor, Alderman Gay Mitchell who commissioned an expert group to consider and report on the feasibility of organising a Dublin Literary Award. The expert group comprised of Chair, Mr. Sean Donlon (of the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and GPA), Deirdre Ellis-King, Dublin City Librarian, Professor Augustine Martin of University College Dublin, Senator David Norris, Trinity College Dublin and Colm O'Briain, formerly Director of the Irish Arts Council. Their Report was adopted by the City Council and incorporated into the Report of the Lord Mayor's Commission on Economic Development in Dublin. It involves libraries from all corners of the globe, and is open to books written in any language. The Award, an initiative of Dublin City Council, is a partnership between Dublin City Council, the Municipal Government of Dublin City, and IMPAC, a productivity improvement company which operates in over 50 countries. The Award is administered by Dublin City Public Libraries.&quot;5
The Lambda Awards
&quot;The first Lambda Literary Awards were presented at a black-tie gala ceremony in 1989. Every year since then they have been awarded to the finest lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans literature available in the United States. The &lt;U+201C&gt;Lammy&lt;U+201D&gt; is the most prestigious, competitive, and comprehensive literary award offered specifically to LGBT authors. For more than two decades the Lambda Literary Awards has brought attention to and honoured exceptional writing about queer lives across multiple genres published by large and small presses. If a book has a gold sticker saying &lt;U+2018&gt;Winner of the Lambda Literary Award&lt;U+2019&gt; on its cover, you know it is both brilliantly written and a meaningful examination of the LGBTQ experience.&quot;6
The Rogers Trust Prize
&quot;The Rogers Writers&lt;U+2019&gt; Trust Fiction Prize recognizes Canadian writers of exceptional talent for the year's best novel or short-story collection. The winner, selected by a three-member, independent judging panel, is announced at the Writers&lt;U+2019&gt; Trust Awards event.&quot;7
The Relit Awards
&quot;The ReLit Awards (Ideas, Not Money) were founded in 2000 as an alternative to the big-money prizes.
The awards are open to books published by independent Canadian literary publishers.
ReLit is short for Regarding Literature, Reinventing Literature, Relighting Literature...&quot;8
