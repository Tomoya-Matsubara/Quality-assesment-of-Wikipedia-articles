Water skiing
Coming from a water skiing family, her father Peter won the Australian title eleven times and sister Sarah placed second at the 2007 World Championships. She first learnt to ski at the age of four and started racing when she was nine years old. In 2003, she placed second in the Junior Division and at the next World Championships in 2005 she won the women&lt;U+2019&gt;s division title in the F2 class. In 2006, she won the Australian Speed Championships (U/19) and the Australian Marathon Champs (U/19). She then finished third at the 2007 World Championship in May in the Formula 1 Division.3 She retired from racing after her father's death in 2008.4

The match was widely criticised within the boxing media. Commentators pointed out that Eagle had not fought more than 6 rounds in her career, and had not won a fight since 2010.6 It was also noted that Sithsaithong's record was almost entirely against debut fighters7 in Thai villages.8

In 2006, she won the FHM Lara Croft Challenge involved physical challenges of shooting, running, ropes, ladders, 4-wheel driving and swimming.
She starred in the second season of the Celebrity Apprentice Australia where she lasted until the final episode where she finished fourth.

In March 2008, Eagle's father Peter, a 10-time Australian water-skiing champion, died when his speedboat flipped and crashed.13
