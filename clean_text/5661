In the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, hundreds of thousands of Polish soldiers became prisoners in Soviet Union. Thousands of them would be executed; over 20,000 Polish military personnel and civilians perished in the infamous Katyn massacre.12
Soviet invasion of Poland

   
On September 17 1939 the Red Army invaded the territory of Poland from the east. This invasion took place while Poland had already sustained serious defeats in the wake of the German attack on the country that started on September 1 1939; thus Soviets moved to safeguard their claims in accordance with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.3
In the wake of the Red Army's quick advance that met little resistance, about 6,000&lt;U+2013&gt;7,000 Polish soldiers died fighting the Red Army,4 and 230,000&lt;U+2013&gt;450,000 were taken prisoner&lt;U+2014&gt;230,000 immediately after the campaign and 70,000 more when the Soviets annexed the Baltic States and assumed custody of Polish troops interned there.56 789
The Soviets often failed to honour terms of surrender. In some cases, they promised Polish soldiers freedom after surrender and then arrested them when they lay down their arms.10 Some Polish soldiers were murdered shortly after capture and surrender, like General J&lt;U+00F3&gt;zef Olszyna-Wilczy&lt;U+0144&gt;ski, who was captured, interrogated and shot on 22 September, during the invasion itself.111213 On 24 September, the Soviets murdered forty-two staff and patients of a Polish military hospital in the village of Grabowiec near Zamo&lt;U+015B&gt;&lt;U+0107&gt;.14 After a tactical Polish victory at the battle of Szack on 28 September, where the combined KOP forces under general Wilhelm Orlik-Rueckemann routed the Soviet 52nd Rifle Division, the Soviets executed all the Polish officers they captured.15
First period (1939-1941)
Poland and the Soviet Union never officially declared war on each other; the Soviets effectively broke off diplomatic relations when they withdrew recognition of the Polish government at the start of the invasion.16 The Soviets chose therefore to regard Polish military prisoners not as prisoners of war but as counter-revolutionaries illegitimately resisting the legal Soviet reclamation of West Ukraine and West Belarus.17 The USSR refused to allow Red Cross supervision of prisoners on the grounds that it had not signed the  1929 Geneva Convention on the Treatment of PoWs and did not recognise the Hague Convention. Prisoners were handed over by the military to the NKVD and sentenced under clauses in the Soviet Penal Code, including treason and counter-revolution, and were not considered subject to the &quot;Regulations for the Treatment of Prisoners of War&quot; approved by the Soviet Council of Ministers.18
As early as September 19 1939, the People's Commissar for Internal Affairs and First Rank Commissar of State Security, Lavrenty Beria, ordered the NKVD to create a Directorate for Prisoners of War19 (or USSR NKVD Board for Prisoners of War and Internees, headed by State Security Captain Pyotr Soprunenko20) to manage Polish prisoners. The NKVD took custody of Polish prisoners from the Red Army, and proceeded to organize a network of reception centers and transit camps and arrange rail transport to prisoner-of-war camps in the western USSR. The camps were located at Jukhnovo (Babynino rail station), Yuzhe (Talitsy), Kozelsk, Kozelshchyna, Oranki, Ostashkov (Stolbnyi Island on Seliger Lake near Ostashkov), Tyotkino rail station (56 mi/90 km from Putyvl), Starobielsk, Vologda (Zaenikevo rail station) and Gryazovets.21
Kozelsk and Starobielsk were used mainly for military officers, while Ostashkov was used mainly for Boy Scouts, gendarmes, police officers and prison officers. Prisoners at these camps were not exclusively military officers or members of the other groups mentioned, but also included Polish intelligentsia. The approximate distribution of men throughout the camps was as follows: Kozelsk, 5,000; Ostashkov, 6,570; and Starobelsk, 4,000. They totalled 15,570 men.22
Once at the camps, from October 1939 to February 1940, the Poles were subjected to lengthy interrogations and constant political agitation by NKVD officers such as Vasily Zarubin. The Poles were encouraged to believe they would be released,23 but the interviews were in effect a selection process to determine who would live and who would die.24 According to NKVD reports, the prisoners could not be induced to adopt a pro-Soviet attitude.25 They were declared &quot;hardened and uncompromising enemies of Soviet authority.&quot;26
On March 5 1940, pursuant to a note to Joseph Stalin from Lavrenty Beria, the members of the Soviet Politburo — Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Mikhail Kalinin, Kliment Voroshilov, Anastas Mikoyan and Beria — signed an order to execute 25,700 Polish &quot;nationalists and counterrevolutionaries&quot; kept at camps and prisons in occupied western Ukraine and Belarus.27 This became known as the Katyn massacre.2829
Second period (1941-1944)

The diplomatic relations relations were however re-established in 1941 after German invasion of the Soviet Union forced Stalin to look for allies. Thus the military agreement from August 14 and subsequent Sikorski-Mayski Agreement from August 17, 1941, resulted in Stalin agreeing to declare the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in relation to Poland null and void,30 and release tens of thousands of Polish prisoners-of-war held in Soviet camps. Pursuant to an agreement between the Polish government-in-exile and Stalin, the Soviets granted &quot;amnesty&quot; to many Polish citizens, from whom a military force was formed. Stalin also agreed that this military force would be subordinate to the Polish government-in-exile. This force was known as the Anders Army. From 1943 Poles were recruited to the Berling Army.
Third period (after 1944)
Third group of Polish prisoners were members of Polish resistance organizations (Armia Krajowa, cursed soldiers) loyal to the Polish government-in-exile and seen by Soviets as threat to their estabilishment of power base in 'liberated' Poland. Relatively few were sent to Soviet Union (although there were notable exceptions, see Trial of the Sixteen); most were transferred to the Polish communist security forces and prisons, or enlisted in the Berling Army.

As a result there was confusion over the status of soldiers taken captive and whether they qualified for treatment as PoWs. Jurists consider that the absence of a formal declaration of war does not absolve a power from the obligations of civilised conduct towards PoWs. On the contrary, failure to do so makes those involved, both leaders and operational subordinates, liable to charges of War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity.&quot;↩
