Alice in Chains is an American heavy metal band formed in Seattle, Washington in 1987. The band is currently fronted by William DuVall. The band has released three studio albums, three EPs, two live albums, four compilations, and two DVDs. They are currently working on the first studio album recorded since the 1995 album Alice in Chains. This will be the first album from the band without former lead singer Layne Staley, who died in 2002.
Alice in Chains was one of the most successful bands from the Seattle grunge music scene, selling an nearly 11 million albums in the United States alone according to the RIAA. They have had two number 1 albums (Jar of Flies and Alice in Chains) on the Billboard 200, eleven top 10 singles on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and have been nominated for six Grammy Awards.
History
Early career (1987&lt;U+2013&gt;1990)
In 1987,1 Layne Staley met guitarist and song-writer Jerry Cantrell at a practice studio named &quot;Music Bank&quot;.2 Staley was trying to form a band due to the decline of his then-current band, Sleeze, and asked Cantrell to join him. Cantrell disbanded his band, Diamond Lie, and asked the bassist Mike Starr to join the new band, named Alice N' Chains.3 Cantrell also asked Sean Kinney, a drummer dating Cantrell's sister at the time, to join the band.45 The new group began writing original material and playing clubs in Seattle, eventually changing their name to Alice in Chains. Their name was derived from Staley's former band, Sleeze, stating, &quot;We were dressed in drag and played speed metal, it just seemed to be a suitable name for us&quot;.6
In 1989 Columbia Records signed the band. After recording a series of demos in early 1989, the band released their first official recording in July 1990, entitled We Die Young. The title track had moderate success on metal-oriented radio, preparing the way for the release later that year of the group's first full-length studio album, Facelift, which debuted at #42 on the Billboard 200 charts.78 The song &quot;Man in the Box&quot; had unexpected success as a single, the video for which went into regular rotation on MTV. Facelift was certified gold by the RIAA, with access sales of 500,000 copies in the United States at the end of the year. The successful debut was supported by a tour opening for Van Halen, Poison, and Iggy Pop.9
Rise to fame (1991&lt;U+2013&gt;1994)
On 1992-03-21 Alice in Chains released their second EP entitled Sap. The EP contained five acoustic songs (one being a hidden track), in order to keep the band in the public eye between the albums Facelift and Dirt.10 Sap featured guest artists such as Ann Wilson of Heart, who joined Staley and Cantrell for the choruses of &quot;Brother&quot;, &quot;Am I Inside&quot; and &quot;Love Song&quot;, as well as Mark Arm of Mudhoney and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, who appeared on the song &quot;Right Turn&quot; (credited in the liner notes to Alice Mudgarden). Chris Cornell also sang some backing vocals on the track &quot;Brother&quot;.11 The album has been certified gold by the RIAA.
The band received exposure to pop culture in 1992 when one of their new songs, &quot;Would?&quot;, appeared on the soundtrack for Singles, a motion picture by filmmaker Cameron Crowe based on the lives of Seattle singles. The band also appeared in the film, performing the songs &quot;Would?&quot; and &quot;It Ain't Like That&quot; during one of the club scenes.12
On 1992-09-29, Alice in Chains' second full length album Dirt was released. The album peaked at number 6 on the Billboard charts, and since its release it has been certified 4x platinum by the RIAA. This is the band's highest selling album and considered by many fans and All Music Guide, their best work.1314 Dirt featured some of the band's highest charting singles, and featured a song titled &quot;Iron Gland&quot; with guest vocalist Tom Araya of Slayer.15 While the band was touring to promote Dirt, Starr left the group due to the band's nonstop schedule, to spend time with his family.16 Starr was soon replaced by former Ozzy Osbourne bassist Mike Inez. The band met in the studio once again in 1993 to record two new songs, &quot;What the Hell Have I?&quot; and &quot;A Little Bitter&quot;, for the soundtrack of the Arnold Schwarzenegger film, Last Action Hero.17 During the summer of 1993, Alice in Chains joined bands such as Primus, Tool, Rage Against the Machine, and Babes in Toyland for the alternative music festival Lollapalooza. It would be the last time that Alice in Chains would undertake a major tour.18
On 1994-01-25, the band released their second acoustic based EP entitled Jar of Flies. With a track list of seven songs, Jar of Flies was firmly in the EP category but debuted at No. 1 on album sales charts, the first EP ever to reach that position.19 The EP was written and recorded in a week.20 It featured their first and only number one single on the Mainstream Rock charts, entitled &quot;No Excuses&quot;. Following its release, Alice in Chains were scheduled to tour during the summer of 1994 with Metallica and opener Suicidal Tendencies but withdrew prior to the start of the tour. Danzig replaced Alice in Chains in some venues, while others were played by Candlebox.21
Later years (1995&lt;U+2013&gt;1997)
The band did not tour for the remainder of their time with Staley, adding fuel to speculation about Staley's addiction to heroin.22 Staley performed several shows with Mad Season, a &quot;grunge supergroup&quot; side project formed in 1995 with Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready and Screaming Trees drummer Barrett Martin. Mad Season released one studio album entitled, Above, featuring Staley.23
On 1995-11-07, Alice in Chains returned with the release of a self-titled album, Alice in Chains. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and has been certified 2x platinum.24 The group again failed to support the album with a tour, due to Stayley's increasing heroin addiction.25 This would be the last studio album that Alice in Chains would produce.26
The band re-surfaced on 1996-04-10 to perform their first concert in three years on MTV Unplugged, a program featuring all-acoustic setlists.27 At a point in the program Staley sang the incorrect verse to the song &quot;Sludge Factory&quot;, causing the song to break down, and forcing the band to restart it. In fact, the band took six attempts at &quot;Sludge Factory&quot; before being satisfied with the results.28 The set included the popular singles &quot;Down in a Hole&quot;, &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot;, and &quot;Would?&quot;.29 The band reworked their heavier songs with fresh acoustic arrangements and included a rhythm guitarist, Scott Olson, to fill out the sound.30 They also introduced a new song, &quot;Killer Is Me&quot;. An album and video of the performance were released in July of that year, with the album debuting at number three on the Billboard 200.31 Both releases have been certified platinum.
After the Unplugged show, the band opened four shows on the Kiss reunion tour filling in for Stone Temple Pilots, who had to pull out because of lead singer Scott Weiland's drug problems. The concert held on 1996-07-03 in Kansas City, Missouri was the last concert Alice in Chains performed with Staley.32
Hiatus and the death of Layne Staley (1998&lt;U+2013&gt;2002)
Cantrell wanted to keep the band together and tried to stay in touch with Staley, but it became clear that Staley's health would not allow him to return to work any time soon. Cantrell continued writing and recording, releasing his first solo album in 1998, entitled Boggy Depot. Due to the significant contributions of Inez, Kinney and producer Toby Wright to the album, many fans consider Boggy Depot to be a 'lost' Alice in Chains album.33
In 1998, Staley reunited with the other members of the group for what would be the last time to record two new songs, &quot;Get Born Again&quot; and &quot;Died&quot;.34 These songs were released in the fall of 1999 on the career-spanning box set, Music Bank. The set contains 48 songs, including rarities, old demos, the two new recordings, and a majority of the album cuts. The group also released Nothing Safe: Best of the Box, which served as a 15-song sampler of Music Bank, as well as their first greatest hits compilation. A live album, simply titled Live, and a second greatest hits compilation, titled Greatest Hits are the group's last official releases.35
Although the band never officially disbanded, Staley spiraled deeper into depression when his girlfriend died from bacterial endocarditis in 1996. He became a recluse, rarely leaving his Seattle condominium.36 The possibility of a full Alice in Chains reunion finally ended on 2002-04-19, when Staley was found dead in his condominium. The coroner approximated Staley's day of death as April 5, which, coincidentally, was the same date of fellow grunge musician Kurt Cobain's death eight years earlier.37
Cantrell, shaken by the death of his friend and bandmate, dedicated his second solo album released in 2002, entitled Degradation Trip, to Staley. The album was released nearly two months after Staley died as a single-disc release and was later re-released, as a two disc set with bonus songs.38
Reunion (2005&lt;U+2013&gt;present)
In 2005, Cantrell, Inez, and Kinney reunited to perform a benefit concert in Seattle for victims of the tsunami disaster that struck south Asia.39 The band included former Damageplan lead singer Pat Lachman as their lead vocalist. Special guests included, Wes Scantlin of Puddle of Mudd and Maynard James Keenan of Tool to assist with vocals, and Ann Wilson of Heart to sing backing vocals on &quot;Brother&quot;.4041
On 2006-03-06, the surviving members of Alice in Chains performed at the VH1's Decades Rock Live concert honoring fellow Seattle rockers Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart. At the concert they performed their own songs, &quot;Would?&quot; (with Pantera/Down vocalist Phil Anselmo) and &quot;Rooster&quot; (with William DuVall and Ann Wilson).42 The band followed it with a short United States club tour, several festival dates in Europe, and a brief tour of Japan. To coincide with the band's reunion, Sony Music released the long-delayed third Alice in Chains compilation, The Essential Alice in Chains, a double album that included 28 songs.43
During the band's reunion shows, they enlisted Comes With the Fall's William DuVall, who previously performed with Cantrell's solo band, to sing lead vocals. Velvet Revolver's Duff McKagan joined the band for the tour, playing rhythm guitar on a few songs.44
Before the tour, Kinney mentioned in an interview that he would be interested in writing new material, but not as Alice in Chains.45 However, AliceinChains.com reported that the band has began writing new material, with DuVall singing lead vocals. The band plan to release their first studio album since the 1995 album Alice in Chains, by the end of 2008.46
Style
Alyssa Burrows reports, &quot;Alice in Chains' distinctive sound came from Staley's vocal style&quot;.47 CMT states the band has &quot;a Sabbath-like crawl&quot;.48 CMT praises, &quot;Alice in Chains was the definitive heavy metal band of the early '90s&quot;, stating &quot;the band developed a bleak, nihilistic sound that balanced grinding hard rock with subtly textured acoustic numbers&quot;. Greg Prato of All Music Guide stated, &quot;They were hard enough for metal fans, yet their dark subject matter and punky attack placed them among the front ranks of the Seattle-based grunge bands&quot;.49 The band's debut album Facelift was described as, &quot;a fusion of grunge, metal, alternative rock and a hint of jazz&quot;. Dirt was praised as, &quot;without a doubt one of the darkest and best albums of the 90&lt;U+2019&gt;s&quot;.50
Staley's singing style has been described as, &quot;distinct&quot; and &quot;thick as a brick&quot;, by Joe D'Angelo of MTV news.51 Cantrell's musical style is described as &quot;slow, brooding minor-key grinds topped with flat vocal harmonies&quot;.52 Katherine Turman of Amazon.com commented on Cantrell's debut solo album Boggy Depot, &quot;Jerry Cantrell is a brutal emotional exorcism, the brooding and insinuating music perfectly suited to the pained and pointed lyrics&quot;.53
