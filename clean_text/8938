The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) currently lists 22 volcanoes in the Philippines as active.1
The Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program lists more volcanoes in the Philippines2 some of which should be considered as active and so are included in this list.
The PHIVOLCS listing was the original basis of this list, which has been corrected and updated here as newer information became available, to now show 26 active volcanoes in the Philippines.
Volcanoes listed as inactive or potentially active may start erupting with very little warning, such as Pinatubo in 1991. Submarine volcanoes similarly may appear without any prior activity being noticed. This list therefore should not be considered final.
