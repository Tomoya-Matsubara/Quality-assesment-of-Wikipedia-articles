Edward Purcell (1689&lt;U+2013&gt;1740) was born in Westminster, London, the only surviving son of the English Baroque master, Henry Purcell. When his mother Frances died in February 1706, she stated in her will, and apparently in accordance with her husband's wishes, that she had given him a good education.&lt;ref name&quot;Grove&quot;&gt;Holman, Peter, and Thompson, Robert 'Edward Purcell' in Grove Music Online (ed. L. Macy), &lt;http://www.grovemusic.com&gt;, accessed 15 March 2008 She also bequeathed to him music and instruments: &quot;the organ, the double spinnet, the single spinnet&quot;; possibly the instruments her husband had used.&lt;ref name&quot;Holman&quot;&gt;Holman, Peter (1994) Henry Purcell (Series: Oxford Studies of Composers). Oxford: Oxford University Press. 98.
Edward became organist of St Clement Eastcheap, in London at the end of 1711, a position he retained for the rest of his life. He was unsuccessful in his attempts to succeed his uncle Daniel Purcell as organist of  St Andrew's, Holborn, on 19 February 1718 and again on 3 April 1719.&lt;ref name&quot;Dawe&quot;&gt;Dawe, Donovan 'Edward Purcell' in Organs and Organists of the City of London.

He eventually became organist at St. Margaret's, Westminster, on 8 July 1726, concurrent with his post at Eastcheap.&lt;ref name&quot;Dawe&quot;&gt;Dawe, Donovan 'Edward Purcell' in Organs and Organists of the City of London. Padstow: Dawe. 136
In 1739, the year before his death, he was one of the founder-members of the London-based musicians' benevolent society then known as the Society of Musicians (later to become the Royal Society of Musicians).&lt;ref name&quot;Matthews&quot;&gt;Matthews, Betty (1985) Members of the Royal Society of Musicians: 1738-1984.

He was buried in St Clement Eastcheap near the organ gallery door, and was succeeded as organist there by his son Edward Henry Purcell (d.1765).&lt;ref name&quot;Dawe&quot;&gt;Dawe, Donovan 'Edward Purcell' in Organs and Organists of the City of London Padstow: Dawe. 136
Edward Purcell published two songs, though the psalm chants often attributed to him seem to be by an earlier namesake, perhaps his uncle Edward.&lt;ref name&quot;Grove&quot;&gt;Holman, Peter, and Thompson, Robert 'Edward Purcell' in Grove Music Online (ed.
