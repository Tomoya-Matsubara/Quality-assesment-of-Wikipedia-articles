James Proctor Knott (August 29, 1830  June 18, 1911) was a U.S. Representative from Kentucky and served as governor of Kentucky from 1883 to 1887. Born in Kentucky, he moved to Missouri in 1850 and began his political career there. He served as Missouri Attorney General from 1859 to 1861, when he resigned rather than swear an oath of allegiance to the federal government just prior to the outbreak of the Civil War.
Knott was disbarred and briefly imprisoned for his refusal to take the oath of allegiance. He returned to Kentucky in 1863 and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1871, he made a notable speech ridiculing the a bill to subsidize westward expansion of railroads. In the speech, he lampooned the remote town of Duluth, Minnesota. The Duluth speech was eventually reprinted in several publications and brought Knott national acclaim. He did not stand for re-election in 1871, instead making a failed bid for governor. In 1875, he returned to the House and served as chair of the judiciary committee.
In 1883, Knott left Congress and made a successful run for governor. He secured major reforms in education, but was stymied in his pursuit of tax reform. After his term as governor, he was a delegate to the state's constitutional convention in 1891. In 1892, he became a professor at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky and in 1894, helped organized the college's law school. He served as dean of the school until an illness forced him to retire in 1902. He died at his home in Lebanon, Kentucky on August 29, 1830.
Early life
J. Proctor Knott was born in Raywick, Marion County, Kentucky on August 29, 1830.1 He was the son of Joseph Percy and Maria (Irvine) Knott.2 From an early age, he was tutored by his father and attended public school in Marion and Shelby counties.34 In 1846, he began to study law.5 In May 1850, he relocated to Memphis, Missouri, where he was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in 1851.6 He also served in the offices of the circuit court and county clerks.7
Knott married Mary E. Forman on November 17, 1852.8 Forman died during the birth of the couple's first child in August 1853.910 On January 14, 1858, Knott married his cousin, Sarah R. McElroy.11
Political career
Knott's political career began in 1857 when he was elected to represent Scotland County in the Missouri House of Representatives.12 He served as chair of the judiciary committee and conducted the impeachment hearings against judge Albert Jackson.13 In August 1858, Knott resigned his seat in the legislature to accept Governor Robert M. Stewart's appointment to fill the unexpired term of Missouri's attorney general, Ephraim B. Ewing.14 In 1860, he was elected to a full term as attorney general.15
In January 1861, Missouri called a convention to determine whether it would follow the lead of other pro-slavery states and secede from the Union.16 Knott was sympathetic to the southern cause, but opposed the methods of the secessionists.17 The Unionist position carried the convention by an 80,000-vote majority.18 Knott resigned his position as attorney general rather than take an oath of allegiance required by the federal government.19 As a result of his refusal, he was disbarred from practice in the state of Missouri and imprisoned for a short time.20
In the House of Representatives
In 1863, Knott returned to Kentucky and re-opened his legal practice in Lebanon.21 He was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1867.22 As a legislator, he opposed the Reconstruction agenda of the Radical Republicans and ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments.2324 He was re-elected to a second term, but did not stand for re-election in 1870.25
Knott's most notable action as a legislator occurred near the end of his first stint in Congress. On January 27, 1871, he delivered a satirical speech ridiculing a bill that would have provided fifty-seven land grants and financial concessions to railroads to further their westward expansion.26 Knott singled out the Bayfield and St. Croix Railroad's proposed line from the St. Croix River to Duluth, Minnesota to make his point.27 Following the speech, the railroad bill was killed and Congress adjourned for the day.28
Knott's speech, known as Duluth! or The Untold Delights of Duluth, brought him national acclaim and copies of the speech were reprinted and sold.29 Residents of Duluth apparently were not offended by the speech, extending an offer for Knott to visit the city he had ridiculed; Knott accepted the offer in 1891.30 A rail car sorting yard outside of Duluth was named after Proctor Knott in 1890, and the town of &quot;Proctorknott&quot;, now Proctor, Minnesota, took its name from those yards and from Proctor Knott himself.
In 1871, Knott made an unsuccessful bid to become governor of Kentucky, losing the Democratic nomination to Preston Leslie.31 He was re-elected to the House of Representatives in 1875, serving four consecutive terms.32 He chaired the House Judiciary Committee for the first three of these terms.33 In 1876, he was named one of the managers of impeachment proceedings against ex-Secretary of War William W. Belknap.34
As governor of Kentucky
Knott was one of several candidates vying for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1883. Other prominent candidates included Congressman Thomas Laurens Jones, former Confederate general Simon Bolivar Buckner, Judge John S. Owsley, and Louisville mayor Charles Donald Jacob. Balloting began on May 16, 1883, with Jones being the leading vote-getter, but unable to secure a majority. After four ballots, Jacob withdrew his name, and Knott moved into the lead. The following day, Owsley dropped out of the balloting, and Knott extended his lead. Though Buckner remained on the ballot, the race came down to Jones and Knott. Delegates from Owen County switched to Knott, and other counties soon followed suit. Jones withdrew, and Knott was nominated unanimously.35
In the general election, Knott defeated Republican Thomas Z. Morrow by a margin of nearly 45,000 votes.36 During his term in office, Knott asked the legislature to conduct a thorough reform of the state's tax system, but the legislators' only response was to create a board of equalization charged with making equitable assessments.37 They also refused to grant the Railroad Commission all the powers Knott had requested.38
Knott's most successful initiatives were in the area of education. The state established a teacher training school for blacks in Frankfort and created a state teacher's organization.39 The legislature also approved the construction of the Kentucky State Penitentiary at Eddyville, a project for which Knott's predecessor, Luke P. Blackburn had laid the groundwork.40 Feuds continued to rage in Kentucky during Knott's term in office, including one that lasted several years in Rowan County.41 Knott refused to acknowledge lawlessness as a problem, however, and eventually became known for the number of pardons he granted as governor.42
Later life and death
Following his term as governor, Knott continued his legal practice in Frankfort.43 He declined two separate appointments offered to him by President Grover Cleveland.44 The first was to become Territorial Governor of Hawai'i and the other was an appointment to the Interstate Commerce Commission.45 Knott served as a special assistant to Kentucky's attorney general in 1887 and 1888, and in 1891, he was chosen as a delegate to the state constitutional convention.46
Knott became a professor of civics and economics at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky in 1892.47 In 1894, Knott and Centre president William C. Young organized a law department at the college and Knott became the department's first dean.48 An illness forced him to retire in 1902.49 He died in Lebanon on June 18, 1911 and was buried at the Ryder Cemetery in Lebanon.50 Knott County, Kentucky was formed in 1884 and named in his honor.51
