__NOTOC__ This article contains the results of the Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008 and related events. For an overview of the nomination process and a simplified explanation of results, see that main article. For detailed results of individual state contests, click the state names below.
Overview of results
The following table lists events that have taken place in the race for the Democratic nomination. Some states hold multiple events. For example, Washington uses a series of precinct-, county-, and state-level caucuses to award delegates; the February 9 Washington caucus provides an estimate of delegates to be awarded at later events, but that number may change as subsequent events unfold. In another example, Texas holds both a primary and a caucus, both of which award delegates. There are 65 total events listed below, 48 of which have taken place. Barack Obama has won the most delegates in 30 of these events, while Hillary Clinton has won the most delegates in 13, and they have tied in two. Three events did not award any delegates. 17 events remain, of which three will not award any delegates.
Notes for the following table:

Except where noted otherwise, the source for all data comes from each state's primary or caucus article, available by clicking on a state's name.
The data contained in the row entitled Actual pledged delegates is a subset of the data in the row entitled Estimated pledged delegates. It represents delegates won in contests where the final apportionment of delegates has already been decided, but does not include delegates from contests where the final apportionment depends upon the outcome of further caucuses or conventions.1{{-}}
A dash (&lt;U+2013&gt;) indicates that a candidate was not on the ballot. For contests that are in progress or upcoming, all candidates have a dash.
These delegate numbers are estimates. Delegates will be officially allocated during later caucuses, primaries, or state conventions.
These delegations use multiple caucus, primary, or state convention processes to choose national delegates on different days. These processes are explained on each state's caucus article.

Popular vote

Popular vote margins in the Democratic primaries and caucuses. The darkest purple states voted for Obama by the largest margins, while the darkest green states voted for Clinton by the largest margins. (Popular vote winners and delegate winners differ in four states: NH, NV, MO, and TX.)


First-place results in the popular vote by county. First place may be less than 50%. See: plurality. Green for Clinton, Purple for Obama, Orange for Edwards.

The following table contains popular vote data for the two remaining viable contenders, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. The source is RealClearPolitics,6 which aggregates data from official state results and news sources. Officially, the popular vote count does not matter in the Democratic presidential nomination. However, political experts sometimes look to the popular vote as an indicator of candidate support and momentum, and it may affect voter enthusiasm and press coverage about the race. News organizations frequently report the popular vote on election night, declaring states &quot;won&quot; on this basis. Most importantly, superdelegates may take the popular vote into consideration when making their decision about whom to support.
Nevertheless, the popular vote count presents many problems and should be interpreted carefully:

Official numbers have not been released in Iowa, Nevada, Washington, and Maine, so these four states are excluded from the totals in this table. Obama received more delegates in these four states (97 to 61), and it is likely that his lead in the popular vote would increase if these states were included.


This table treats one caucus participant as equal to one primary participant, but turnout is generally much lower in caucuses than in primary elections. As a result, the popular vote count may overweight the influence of primary states. For example, Hawaii's population is slightly larger than Rhode Island's, but Hawaii votes by caucus and Rhode Island votes by primary, so the opinion of Rhode Islanders has a greater influence on the popular vote count. Obama won the Hawaii caucus 76-24% but received only 19,512 more votes than Clinton. In contrast, Clinton won the Rhode Island primary by a smaller margin, 58-40%, but received 33,635 more votes than Obama. As Obama has done significantly better in most caucus states, his supporters argue that the popular vote count underestimates the true depth of his popular support. Clinton supporters counter that she would have done better in these states if primaries were held. This argument is supported by the results of the two states that have held both primaries and caucuses, Washington and Texas, where Clinton performed better in the primaries.


Florida and Michigan have been penalized by the Democratic party for holding their primaries before February 5, and their delegations will not be seated at the Democratic Convention. In Michigan, only Clinton's name was on the ballot, and she won against &quot;Uncommitted&quot; by 55 to 40%. These results are not included in the popular vote estimate. In Florida, where neither candidate campaigned, Clinton won by 50% to 33%. This is included in a separate column. Clinton's supporters argue that her popular vote total would be increased if the Michigan and Florida numbers were included. Obama's supporters counter that his performance in these states would have improved if the races had been contested normally. This argument is supported by polling data that shows Obama consistently gaining ground in states when he begins to actively campaign in them.


Finally, it should be noted that the nomination will be decided by delegates, so the candidates have campaigned to maximize their delegate advantage. If the nomination were decided by the popular vote, the candidates would likely campaign differently in order to maximize their popular vote advantage. Thus, some observers argue that any estimate of the popular vote is meaningless under the current rules.
