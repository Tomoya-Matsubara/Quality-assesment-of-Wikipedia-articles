Olmec colossal heads are a distinctive feature of the Olmec civilization of ancient Mesoamerica.Diehl 2004, p.111. The first archaeological investigations of Olmec culture were carried out by Matthew Stirling at Tres Zapotes in 1938, spurred by the discovery of a colossal head there in the 19th century. Seventeen confirmed examples of stone heads are known, all from within the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico, in the states of Veracruz and Tabasco. Most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from San Lorenzo Tenochtitln were recarved from massive stone thrones. An additional monument, at Takalik Abaj in Guatemala, is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head. This is the only known example outside the Olmec heartland.Pool 2007, p.57. 

Dating of the monuments has proven difficult due to the movement of many from their original context. Most of the heads have been dated to the Early Preclassic 15001000&nbsp;BC and some to the Middle Preclassic 1000400&nbsp;BC. The smallest examples weigh 6 tons, while the largest is variously estimated to weigh 40 to 50 tons, although this was abandoned unfinished near to the source of its stone.

Olmec colossal heads were sculpted from large basalt boulders quarried in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. They were transported over large distances, although the method used for transportation is not clear. Finished momuments represented lifelike portraits of individual Olmec rulers, each wearing a distinctive headdress, and heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major Olmec centres.

All of the Olmec colossal heads depict mature men with fleshy cheeks, flat noses and eyes that tend to be slightly crossed. The general physical characteristics of the heads are of a type that is still common among people in Tabasco and Veracruz in modern times. The backs of the heads are often flat.

Dating
The colossal heads cannot be precisely dated but the San Lorenzo heads were buried by 900&nbsp;BC, indicating that their period of manufacture and use was earlier still. The heads from Tres Zapotes had been moved from their original context before they were investigated by archaeologists and the heads from La Venta were found partially exposed on the modern ground surface. Due to these factors, the period of production of the colossal heads is not known, nor whether it spanned a century or a millennium. Estimates of the time span of head production vary from 50 years to 200 years.Diehl 2004, p.112. Pool 2007, p.118. The San Lorenzo heads are believed to be the oldest examples of the type and are the most skillfully executed.de la Fuente 1996a, pp.&nbsp;4849. All of the stone heads have been assigned to the Preclassic period of Mesoamerican chronology, generally to the Early Preclassic 15001000&nbsp;BC, although the two Tres Zapotes heads and the La Cobata Head are attributed to the Middle Preclassic 1000400&nbsp;BC.Pool 2007, pp.7, 117118, 251.

Characteristics
File:Cabeza Colosal n1 del Museo Xalapa.jpg thumb right San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;1
Olmec colossal heads vary in height from convert 1.47 to 3.4 m ft and weigh between 6 and 50 tons.Pool 2007, p.106. All of the Olmec colossal heads depict mature men with flat noses and fleshy cheeks; the eyes tend to be slightly crossed. The general physical characteristics of the heads are of a type that is still common among people in the Olmec region in modern times. The backs of the heads are often flat, as if the monuments were originally placed against a wall. All examples of Olmec colossal heads wear distinctive headdresses that probably represent cloth or animal hide originals.Diehl 2004, pp.&nbsp;111112. Some examples have a tied knot at the back of the head, and some are decorated with feathers. A head from La Venta is decorated with the head of a bird. There are similarities between the headdresses on some of the heads that has led to speculation that specific headdresses may represent different dynasties, or perhaps identify specific rulers. Most of the heads wear large Plug jewellery earspools inserted into the ear lobes.Diehl 2004,p.112.

All of the heads are notably realistic, and it is likely that they were portraits of living or recently deceased rulers who were well known to the sculptors. Each head is distinct and naturalistic, displaying individualised features. They were once thought to represent Mesoamerican ballgame ballplayers although this theory is no longer widely held; it is possible, however, that they represent rulers equipped for the Mesoamerican ballgame. Expressions depicted on the heads vary from stern through placid to smiling.

In the late 19th century, Jos Melgar y Serrano described a colossal head as having Ethiopian features and Olmec alternative origin speculations African origin speculation resurfaced in 1960 in the work of Alfonso Medelln Zenil and in the 1970s in the writings of Ivan van Sertima.de la Fuente 1996a, p.48. Diehl 2004, pp.112, 194c5n6. Such speculation is not taken seriously by Mesoamerican scholars such as Richard Diehl and Ann Cyphers.Diehl 2004, p.112. Cyphers 1996, p.156.

Although all the colossal heads are broadly similar, there are distinct stylistic differences in their execution. One of the heads from San Lorenzo bears traces of plaster and red paint, suggesting that the heads were originally brightly decorated. Heads did not just represent individual Olmec rulers, they also incorporated the very concept of rulership itself.Pool 2007, p.118.

Manufacture
File:La Venta Colossal Head 3.jpg thumb left The unfinished La Venta Colossal Head&nbsp;3
The production of each colossal head must have been carefully planned to ensure that the necessary resources were available and it is likely that only the more powerful Olmec rulers were able to mobilise these resources. The workforce must have included sculptors, labourers, overseers, boatmen, woodworkers and other artesans producing the tools to make and move the monument, as well as all the support to feed and otherwise attend to these workers. The seaonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the production of the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end.Diehl 2011, pp.193194.

All seventeen of the confirmed colossal heads in the Olmec heartland were sculpted from basalt mined in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. Most are sculpted from a coarse grained dark grey basalt known as Cerro Cintepec basalt after a volcano in the range. Investigators have proposed that large Cerro Cintepec basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains are the source of the stone for the monuments.Gillespie 1994, p.231. These boulders are found in an area affected by large lahars volcanic mudslides that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes, which suggests that the Olmecs did not need to quarry the raw material for sculpting the heads.Killion and Urcid 2001, p.6. Boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head. The stone for the San Lorenzo and La Venta heads was transported a considerable distance from the source. The La Cobata head was found on El Vigia hill in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas and the stone from Tres Zapotes Colossal Head&nbsp;1 and Nestepe Colossal Head&nbsp;1 also known as Tres Zapotes Monuments&nbsp;A and&nbsp;Q came from the same hill. Monument&nbsp;20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche. Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned. It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of recarving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed.Diehl 2004, p.119.

The huge boulders were transported over convert 150 km mi from the source of the stone.Diehl 2000, p.164. The exact method of transportation of such large masses of rock are unknown, especially since the Olmecs lacked beasts of burden and functional wheels,Diehl 2004, p.118. and they were likely to have used water transport whenever possible. Two badly damaged Olmec sculptures depict rectangular stone blocks bound with ropes. A largely destroyed human figure rides upon each block, with their legs hanging over the side. Richard Diehl argues that these sculptures depict Olmec rulers overseeing the transport of the stone that would be fashioned into their monuments. When transport over land was necessary, the Olmecs are likely to have used causeways, ramps and roads to facilitate moving the heads.Diehl 2011, p.185.

The flat backs of many of the colossal heads represented the flat bases of the monumental thrones from which they were reworked. Only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened backs, indicating that the majority were probably reworked monuments. Alternatively, the flattened backs of many of the monuments may have eased the transport of these massive monuments. Two of the heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Olmec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments.Pool 2007, p.121.

Archaeological investigation of Olmec basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away both large and small flakes of stone. The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones, which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument intself, although this was not always the case. Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo and indicates their use in the finishing of fine detail. Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in-the-round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses.Pool 2007, p.110.

San Lorenzo
The ten colossal heads from San Lorenzo originally formed two roughly parallel lines running north-south across the site.Diehl 2004, p.35. Pool 2007, p.122. Although some were recovered from ravines,Pool 2007, p.122. they were found close to their original placements and had been buried by local erosion. These heads, together with a number of monumental stone thrones, probably formed a processional route across the site, powerfully displaying its dynastic history.Diehl 2004, p.35. Two of the San Lorenzo heads had been recarved from older thrones.Diehl 2004, p.37.

San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;1 also known as San Lorenzo Monument&nbsp;1ellas04p147 Casellas Caellas 2004, p.147. was lying facing upwards when excavated. The erosion of a path passing on top of the monument uncovered its eye and led to the discovery of the Olmec site.Diehl 2004, plate VI. Colossal Head&nbsp;1 is convert 2.84 m ft high;Coe and Koontz, 1962, 2002, p.4. it measures convert 2.11 m ft wide and it weighs 25.3 tons. The monument was discovered partially buried at the edge of a gully by Matthew Stirling in 1945. When discovered it was lying on its back, looking upwards. It was associated with a large number of broken ceramic vessels and figurines. The majority of these ceramic remains have been dated to between 800 and 400 BC;Casellas Caellas 2004, p.180. Pool 2007, p.7. some pieces have been dated to the Villa Alta phase Late Classic c.AD 8001000.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.180. Coe 1962, 2002, p.9. The headdress possesses a plain band that is tied at the back of the head. The upper portion of the headdress is decorated with a U-shaped motif. This element descends across the front of the headdress, terminating on the forehead. On the front portion it is decorated with five semicircular motifs.Casellas Caellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;179180. The scalp piece does not meet the horizontal band, leaving a space between the two pieces. On each side of the face a strap descends from the headdress and passes in front of the ear.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.180. The forehead is wrinkled in a frown. The lips are slightly parted without revealing the teeth. The cheeks are pronounced and the ears are particularly well executed.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.181. The face is slightly asymmetric, which may be due to error on the part of the sculptors or may accurately reflect the physical features of the portrait's subject.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.182. The head has been moved to the Museo de Antropologa de Xalapa Anthropological Museum of Xalapa.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.179.

San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;2 also known as San Lorenzo Monument&nbsp;2ellas04p147/  was reworked from a monumental throne. The head stands convert 2.69 m ft high and measures convert 1.83 m ft wide by convert 1.05 m ft deep. The head weighs 20 tons. Colossal Head&nbsp;2 was discovered in 1945 when Matthew Stirling's guide cleared away some of the vegetation and mud that covered it.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.183. The monument was found lying on its back, facing the sky, and was excavated in 1946 by Stirling and Philip Drucker. In 1962 the monument was removed from the San Lorenzo plateau in order to put it on display as part of The Olmec tradition exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston Museum of Fine Arts in Houston in 1963.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.184. SULAIR. San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;2 is currently in the Museo Nacional de Antropologa in Mexico City.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.184. The head was associated with a number of ceramic finds; they have been dated to the Early Preclassic and Late Classic periods.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.184. Pool 2007, p.7. Coe 1962, 2002, p.9. Colossal Head&nbsp;2 wears a complex headdress that sports a horizontal band tied at the back of the head; this is decorated with three bird's heads that are located above the forehead and temples.Casellas Caellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;184185. The scalp piece is formed from six strips running towards the back of the head. The front of the headdress above the horizontal band is plain. Two short straps hang down from the headdress in front of the ears. The ear jewellery is formed by large squared hoops or framed discs. The left and right ornaments are different, with radial lines on the left earflare, a feature absent on the right earflare.Casellas Caellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;185186. The head is badly damaged due to an unfinished reworking process. This process has pitmarked the entire face with at least 60 smaller hollows and 2 larger holes.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.188. The surviving features appear to depict an ageing man with the forehead creased into a frown. The lips are thick and slightly parted to reveal the teeth; the head has a pronounced chin.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.186.

San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;3 is also known as San Lorenzo Monument&nbsp;3.ellas04p147/  The head measures convert 1.78 m ft high by convert 1.63 m ft wide by convert 0.95 m ft deep. San Lorenzo Head&nbsp;3 weighs 9.4 tons. The head was discovered in a deep gully by Matthew Stirling in 1946. The monument was found lying face down and its excavation was difficult due to the wet conditions in the gully. Although the monument was found Convert 0.8 km mi southwest of the main mound at San Lorenzo, its original location is unknown; erosion of the gully may have resulted in significant movement of the sculpture.Casellas Caellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;189190. Head&nbsp;3 has been moved to the Museo de Antropologa de Xalapa Xalapa Anthropological Museum.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.189. The headdress is complex, with the horizontal basal band being formed by four horizontal cords, with diagonal folds above each eye. A small skullcap tops the headdress. A large flap formed of four cords drops down both sides of the head, completely covering the ears.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.190. The face has a typically frowning brow and, unusually, has clearly defined eyelids. The lips are thick and slightly parted. The front of the lower lip has broken away completely,Casellas Caellas 2004, p.191. and the lower front of the headdress is pitted with 27 irregularly spaced artificial depressions.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.192.

San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;4 also known as San Lorenzo Monument&nbsp;4ellas04p147/  has been moved to the Museo de Antropologa de Xalapa.Cyphers 2007, p.38. Colossal Head&nbsp;4 is convert 1.78 m ft high,Coe and Koontz, 1962, 2002, p. 69. convert 1.17 m ft wide and convert 0.95 m ft deep. The head was discovered by Matthew Stirling in 1946, convert 550 m yd northwest of the principal mound, at the edge of a gully. When excavated, it was found to be lying on its right-hand side and in a very good state of preservation. The head weighs 6 tons and was moved to the Museo de Antropologa de Xalapa.Cyphers 1996, p. 156. Ceramic materials excavated with the head became mixed with ceramics associated with Head&nbsp;5, making ceramic dating of the monument difficult. The headdress is decorated with a horizontal band formed of four sculpted cords, similar to those of Head&nbsp;3. On the right-hand side, three tassels descend from the upper portion of the headdress; they terminate in a total of eight strips that hang down across the horizontal band. These tassels are judged to represent hair rather than cords.Casellas Caellas 2004, p. 193. Also on the right hand side, two cords descend across the ear and continue to the base of the monument.Casellas Caellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;193194. On the left-hand side, three vertical cords descend across the ear. The earflare is only visible of the right hand side; it is formed of a plain disc and peg. The face is that of an ageing man with a creased forehead, low cheekbones and a prominent chin. The lips are thick and slightly parted.Casellas Caellas 2004, p. 194.

San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;5 is also known as San Lorenzo Monument&nbsp;5.ellas04p147/  The monument stands convert 1.86 m ft high and measures convert 1.47 m ft wide by convert 1.15 m ft deep. It weighs 11.6 tons. The head was discovered by Matthew Stirling in 1946, face down in a gully to the south of the principal mound.Casellas Caellas 2004, p. 195. The head is particularly well executed and is likely to have been found close to its original location. Ceramics recovered during its excavation became mixed with those from the excavation of Head&nbsp;4.Casellas Caellas 2004, p. 196. The mixed ceramics have been dated to the San Lorenzo and Villa Alta phases approximately 14001000 BC and 8001000 AD respectively.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.196. Pool 2007, p.7. Coe 1962, 2002, p.9. Colossal Head&nbsp;5 is particularly well preserved,Casellas Caellas 2004, p. 199. although the back of the headdress band was damaged when the head was moved from the archaeological site.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.200. The band of the headdress is set at an angle and has a notch above the bridge of the nose. The headdress is decorated with jaguar paws;Miller 1986, 1996, pp.&nbsp;2021. this general identification of the decoration is contested by Beatriz de la Fuente since the paws have three claws each; she identifies them as the claws of a bird of prey. At the back of the head, ten interlaced strips form a net decorated with disc motifs. Two short straps descend from the headdress in front of the ears. The ears are adorned with disc-shaped earspools with pegs. The face is that of an ageing man with wrinkles under the eyes and across the bridge of the nose, and a forehead that is creased in a frown.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.197. The lips are slightly parted.Casellas Caellas 2004, p. 198. Colossal Head&nbsp;5 has been moved to the Museo de Antropologa de Xalapa.

San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;6 also known as San Lorenzo Monument&nbsp;17ellas04p147/  is one of the smaller examples of colossal heads, standing convert 1.67 m ft. It measures convert 1.41 m ft wide by convert 1.26 m ft deep and is estimated to weigh between 8 and 10 tons. The head was discovered by a local farmworker and was excavated in 1965 by Luis Aveleyra and Romn Pia Chan. The head had collapsed into a ravine under its own weight and was found face down on its left hand side. In 1970 it was transported to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for the museum's centenary exhibition. After its return to Mexico, it was placed in the Museo Nacional de Antropologa in Mexico City. It is sculpted with a net-like head covering joined together with sculpted beads.Diehl 2004, p. 93. A covering descends from under the headdress to cover back half of the neck.Casellas Caellas 2004, p. 201. The headband is divided into four strips and begins above the right ear, extending around the entire head. A short strap descends from either side of the head to the ear. The ear ornaments are complex and are larger at the front of the ear than at the back. The face is that of an ageing male with the forehead creased in a frown, wrinkles under the eyes, sagging cheeks and deep creases on either side of the nose. The face is somewhat asymmetric, possibly due to errors in the execution of the monument.Casellas Caellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;202203.

San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;7 also known as San Lorenzo Monument&nbsp;53ellas04p147/  measures convert 2.7 m ft high by convert 1.85 m ft wide by convert 1.35 m ft deep and weighs 18 tons.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.204. San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;7 was reworked from a monumental throne. It was discovered by a joint archaeological project by the Instituto Nacional de Antropologa e Historia and Yale University, as a result of a magnetometer survey. It was buried at a depth of less than convert 1 m ft and was lying facing upwards,Breiner and Coe 1972, p.5. leaning slightly northwards on its right hand side.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.206. The head is poorly preserved and has suffered both from erosion and deliberate damage. The headdress is decorated with a pair of human hands; a feathered ornament is carved at the back of the headband and two discs adorn the front.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.207. A short strap descends from the headband and hangs in front of the right ear. The head sports large earflares that completely cover the earlobes, although severe erosion makes their exact form difficult to distinguish. The face has wrinkles between the nose and cheeks, sagging cheeks and deep-set eyes. The lips are badly damaged and the mouth is open, displaying the teeth.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.208. In 1986 the head was transported to the Museo de Antropologa de Xalapa.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.205.

San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;8 also known as San Lorenzo Monument&nbsp;61 stands Convert 2.2 m ft high; it measures convert 1.65 m ft wide by convert 1.6 m ft deep and weighs 13 tons.de la Fuente 1996b, p. 154. Casellas Caellas 2004, p.211. It is one of the finest examples of an Olmec colossal head. It was found lying on its side to the south of a monumental throne. The monument was discovered at a depth of convert 5 m ft during a magnetometer survey of the site in 1968;Diehl 2000, p.165. Breiner and Coe 1972, p.4. it has been dated to the Early Preclassic.Diehl 2000, p.165. After discovery it was initially reburied;Casellas Caellas 2004, p.211. it was moved to the Museo de Antropologa de Xalapa in 1986.de la Fuente 1996b, p.154. The headdress is decorated with the talons or claws of either a Jaguars in Mesoamerican culture jaguar or an eagle.Diehl 2004, pp.39, plate VII. It has a headband and a cover that descends from under the headdress proper behind the ears.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.213. Two shot straps descend in front of the ears.Casellas Caellas 2004, pp.212, 214. The head sports large ear ornaments in the form of pegs. The face is that of a mature male with sagging cheeks and wrinkles between these and the nose. The forehead is gathered in a frown. The mouth is slightly parted to reveal the teeth.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.214. Most of the head is carved in a realistic manner, the exception being the ears. These are stylised and represented by one question mark shape contained within another. The head is very well preserved and displays a fine finish.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.215.

San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;9 is also known as San Lorenzo Monument&nbsp;66.ellas04p147/  It measures convert 1.65 m ft high by convert 1.36 m ft wide by convert 1.17 m ft deep. The head was exposed in 1982 by erosion of the gullies at San Lorenzo. The head was found leaning slightly on its right hand side and facing upwards, half covered by the collapsed side of a gully and washed by a stream. Although it was documented by archaeologists, it remained for some time in its place of discovery before being moved to the Museo de Antropologa de Xalapa. The headdress is of a single piece without a distinct headband. The sides display deatures that are possibly intended to represent long hair trailing to the bottom of the monument.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.216. The earflares are rectangular plates with an additional trapezoid element at the front. The head is also depicted wearing a nose-ring. The face is smiling and has wrinkles under the eyes and at the edge of the mouth. It has sagging cheeks and wide eyes.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.217. The mouth is closed and the upper lip is badly damaged.Casellas Caellas 2004, p. 218. The sculpture has suffered some mutilation in antiquity, with nine pits hollowed into the face and headdress.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.219.

San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;10 also known as San Lorenzo Monument&nbsp;89ellas04p147/  has been moved to the Museo Comunitario de San Lorenzo Tenochtitln in Texistepec.Cyphers 2007, p.36. It stands convert 1.8 m ft tall and measures Convert 1.43 m ft wide by convert 0.92 m ft deep; it weighs 8 tons. The head was discovered by a magnetometer survey in 1994. It was found buried, lying face upwards in the bottom of a ravine and was excavated by Ann Cyphers.Casellas Caellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;219220. The headdress is formed of 92 circular beads that completely cover the upper part of the head and descend across the sides and back. Above the forehead is a large element forming a three-toed foot with long nails, possibly the foot of a bird. The head wears large earspools that protrude beyond the beads of the headdress. The spools have the form of a rounded square with a circular sunken central portion.Casellas Caellas 2004, p. 220. The face is that of a mature man with the mouth closed, sagging cheeks and lines under the eyes. The mouth is sensitively carved and the head possesses a pronounced chin.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.221.

La Venta
File:Olmec warrior.jpg thumb right La Venta Monument&nbsp;1 from the side, displaying the headdress straps and ear ornaments
Three of the La Venta heads were found in a line running east-west in the northern Complex&nbsp;I; all three faced northwards, away from the city centre.Diehl 2004, pp.&nbsp;6263. The other head was found in Complex&nbsp;B to the south of the Great Pyramid, in a plaza that included a number of other sculptures.Diehl 2004, p.66. The latter, the first of the La Venta heads to be discovered, was found during archaeological exploration of La Venta in 1925; the other three remained unknown to archaeologists until a local boy guided Matthew Stirling to them while he was excavating the first head in 1940. They were located approximately convert 0.9 km mi to the north of Monument&nbsp;1.Casellas Caellas 2004, pp.163, 168.

La Venta Monument&nbsp;1 is speculated to have been the portrait of La Venta's final ruler.Diehl 2004, plate V. Monument&nbsp;1 measures convert 2.41 m ft high by convert 2.08 m ft wide by convert 1.95 m ft deep; it weighs 24 tons. The front of the headdress is decorated with three motifs that apparently represent the claws or fangs of an animal. Above these symbols is an angular U-shaped decoration descending from the scalp. On each side of the monument a strap descends from the headdress, passing in front of the ear. Each ear has a prominent ear ornament that descends from the earlobe to the base of the monument. The features are those of a mature man, with wrinkles around the mouth, eyes and nose. Monument&nbsp;1 is the best preserved head at La Venta but has suffered from erosion, particularly at the back.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.166. The head was first described by Franz Blom and Oliver La Farge who investigated the La Venta remains on behalf of Tulane University in 1925. When discovered it was half-buried; its massive size meant that the discoverers were unable to excavate it completely. Matthew Stirling fully excavated the monument in 1940, after clearing the thick vegetation that had covered it in the intervening years. Monument&nbsp;1 has been moved to the Parque Museo La Venta in Villahermosa.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.163. The head was found in its original context; associated finds have been radiocarbon dating radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600&nbsp;BC.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.164.

La Venta Monument&nbsp;2 measures convert 1.63 m ft high by convert 1.35 m ft wide by convert 0.98 m ft deep; the head weighs 11.8 tons. The face has a broadly smiling expression that reveals four of the upper teeth. The cheeks are given prominence by the action of smiling; the brow that is normally visible in other heads is covered by the rim of the headdress.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.169. The face is badly eroded, distorting the features.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.170. In addition to the severe erosion damage, the upper lip and a part of the nose have been deliberately mutilated.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.171. The head was found in its original context a few metres north of the northwest corner of pyramid-platform A-2. Radiocarbon dating of the monument's context dates it to between 1000 and 600&nbsp;BC. Monument&nbsp;2 has suffered erosion damage from its exposure to the elements prior to discovery. The head has a prominent headdress but this is badly eroded and any individual detail has been erased. A strap descends in front of the ear on each side of the head, descending as far as the earlobe. The head is adorned with ear ornaments in the form of a disc that covers the earlobe, with an associated clip or peg. The surviving details of the headdress and earflares are stylistically similar to those of Tres Zapotes Monument&nbsp;A.Casellas Caellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;168169. The head has been moved to the Museo del Estado de Tabasco Tabasco State Museum in Villahermosa.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.168.

File:Olmec2.jpg thumb left La Venta Monument&nbsp;2
La Venta Monument&nbsp;3 stands convert 1.98 m ft high and measures convert 1.6 m ft wide by convert 1 m ft deep. It weighs 12.8 tons. Monument&nbsp;3 was located a few metres to the east of Monument&nbsp;2. The head has been moved to the Parque Museo La Venta in Villahermosa. Like the other La Venta heads, its context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600&nbsp;BC.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.172. The head appears never to have been finished and has suffered severe erosion damage; both of these factors make its analysis difficult. It had a large headdress that descended to the eyebrows but all detail has been lost to weathering. Straps descend in front of each ear and continue to the base of the monument. The ears are wearing large flattened rings that overlap the straps; they probably represent jade ornaments of a type that have been recovered in the Olmec region. Although most of the facial detail is lost, the crinkling of the bridge of the nose is still evident, a feature that is common to the frowning expressions of the other Olmec colossal heads.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.173.

La Venta Monument&nbsp;4 measures convert 2.26 m ft high by convert 1.98 m ft wide and convert 1.86 m ft deep. It weighs 19.8 tons. It was found a few metres to the west of Monument&nbsp;2 and has been moved to the Parque Museo La Venta.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.175. As with the other heads in the group, its archaeological context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600 BC.The headress is elaborate and, although damaged, various details are still discernable. The base of the headress is formed by three horizontal strips running over the forehead. One side is decorated with a double-disc motif that may have been repeated on the other; if so, damage to the right side has obliterated any trace of it.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.176.  The top of the headdress is decorated with the clawed foot of a bird of prey.Pool 2007, p.166. Casellas Caellas 2004, p.176. Either straps or plaits of hair descend on either side of the face, from the headdress to the base of the monument. Only one earspool survives, it is flat, in the form of a rounded square, and is decorated with a cross motif. The ears have been completely eroded away and the lips are damaged.Casellas Caellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;177178. The surviving features display a frown and creasing around the nose and cheeks.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.177. The head displays prominent teeth.Pool 2007, p.166.

Tres Zapotes
File:Tres Zapotes Monument A.jpg thumb right Monument&nbsp;A from Tres Zapotes
The two colossal heads found at Tres Zapotes are stylistically distinct from the rest of the Olmec heads. Beatriz de la Fuente views them as a late regional survival of an older tradition while other scholars argue that they are merely the kind of regional variant to be expected in a frontier settlement.Diehl 2004, p.46. The two heads are the earliest known stone monuments from Tres Zapotes.Pool 2007, p.250.

Tres Zapotes Monument&nbsp;A also known as Tres Zapotes Colossal Head&nbsp;1 was discovered by accident in the middle of the 19th century,Diehl 2004, p.182. convert 1 km mi to the north of the modern village of Tres Zapotes. It was excavated by Matthew Stirling in 1939 and stands convert 1.47 m ft tall. The monument is convert 1.5 m ft wide by convert 1.45 m ft deep.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.151. It is estimated to weigh 7.8 tons.Diehl 2004, p.14. The head is sculpted with a simple headress with a wide band that is otherwise unadorned, and wears rectangular ear ornaments that project forwards onto the cheeks. The face is carved with deep creases between the cheeks and the nose and around the mouth; the forehead is creased into a frown. The upper lip has suffered recent damage, with the left portion flaking away.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.155. Monument&nbsp;A was the first colossal head ever found, in the middle of the 19th century. After its discovery it remained half-buried until it was excavated by Matthew Stirling in the late 1930s. At some point it was moved to the plaza of the modern village, probably in the early 1960s. It has since been moved to the Museo Comunitario de Tres Zapotes.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.152.

Tres Zapotes Monument&nbsp;Q also known as the Nestape Head and Tres Zapotes Colossal Head&nbsp;2 measures convert 1.45 m ft high by convert 1.34 m ft wide and convert 1.26 m ft deep. It weighs 8.5 tons. Its exact date of discovery is unknown but is estimated to have been some time in the 1940s, when it was struck by machinery being used to clear vegetation from Nestape hill. Monument&nbsp;Q was the eleventh colossal head to be discovered. It was moved to the plaza of Santiago Tuxtla in 1951 and remains there to this day.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.156. The headdress is decorated with a frontal tongue-shaped ornament, and the back of the head is sculpted with seven plaits of hair bound with tassels. A strap descends from each side of the headdress, passing over the ears and to the base of the monument. The face has pronounced creases around the nose, mouth and eyes.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.157.

La Cobata
The La Cobata region was the source of the basalt used for carving all of the colossal heads in the Olmec heartland.Hammond 2001. The La Cobata colossal head was discovered in 1970 and was the fifteenth to be recorded. It was discovered in a mountain pass in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas, on the north side of El Vigia volcano near to Santiago Tuxtla.Hammond 2001. Pool 2007, pp.56, 251. The head was largely buried when found; excavations uncovered a Late Classic c. AD 600900 offering associated with the head consisting of a ceramic vessel and a convert 12 cm in adj=on long obsidian use in Mesoamerica obsidian knife place pointing northwards towards the head. The offering is believed to have been deposited long after the head was sculpted.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.160. The La Cobata Head has been moved from its original location to the main plaza at Santiago.

The Cobata head more-or-less rounded and measures convert 3 by 3 m ft by convert 3.4 m ft high, making it the largest known head. This massive sculpture is estimated to weigh 40 tons.Pool 2007, p.56. It is stylistically distinct from the other examples, and Beatriz de la Fuente placed it late in the Olmec time frame. Norman Hammond argues that the apparent stylistic differences of the monument stem from its unfinished state rather than its late production. The eyes of the monument are closed, the nose is flattened and lacks nostrils and the mouth was not sculpted in a realistic manner. The headdress is in the form of a plain horizontal band. The characteristics of the sculpture have led to some investigators suggesting that it represents a deceased person. It is possible, however, that the unusual facial features of the monument are due to it never having been finished.

The original location of the La Cobata head was not a major archaeological site and it is likely that the head was either abandoned at its source or during transport to its intended destination. Various features of the head suggest that it was unfinished, such as a lack of symmetry below the mouth and an area of rough stone above the base. Rock was not removed from around the earspools as on other heads, and does not narrow towards the base. Large parts of the monument seem to be roughed out without finished detail. The right hand earspool also appears incomplete; the forward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief, probably indicating that the right cheek and eye area were also unfinished. The La Cobata head was almost certainly carved from a raw boulder rather than being sculpted from a throne.

Takalik Abaj
File:Takalik Abaj Olmec sculpture 1.JPG thumb right Takalik Abaj Monument&nbsp;23 was possibly the only Olmec head outside of the Olmec heartland and was reworked into a throne.
Takalik Abaj was an important city in the foothills of the Guatemalan Pacific coast, in the modern Departments of Guatemala department of Retalhuleu.Kelly 1996, p.210. Takalik Abaj Monument&nbsp;23 dates to the Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era Middle Preclassic period.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.239. It appears that it was an Olmec-style colossal head that was recarved into a niche figure sculpture.Diehl 2004, p.146. If this was originally a colossal head then it would be the only example known from outside the Olmec heartland.

Collections
All of the 17 confirmed colossal heads remain in Mexico. Two heads from San Lorenzo are on permanent display at the Museo Nacional de Antropologa in Mexico City.Casellas Caellas 2004, pp.184, 200. Seven of the San Lorenzo heads are on display in the Museo de Antropologa de Xalapa. Five of them are in Sala 1, one is in Sala 2 and one is in Patio 1.Museo de Antropologa de Xalapa. Sala 1, Sala 2, Patio 1. The remaining San Lorenzo head is in the Museo Comunitario de San Lorenzo Tenochtitln in Texistepec. All four heads from La Venta are now in Villahermosa, the state capital of Tabasco. Three are in the Parque-Museo La Venta and one in the Museo del Estado de Tabasco.Casellas Caellas 2004, pp.163, 168, 172, 175. Two heads are on display in the plaza of Santiago Tuxtla; one from Tres Zapotes and the La Cobata Head.Casellas Caellas 2004, p.156. Hammond 2001. The other Tres Zapotes head is in the Museo Comunitario de Tres Zapotes.

Several colossal heads have been loaned to temporary exhibitions abroad; San Lorenzo Colossal Head 6 was loaned to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1970. San Lorenzo Colossal Heads 4 and 8 were lent to the Olmec Art of Ancient Mexico exhibition in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. that ran from 30 June to 20 October 1996.Benson and de la Fuente 1996, pp.4, 154157. San Lorenzo Head 4 was again loaned in 2005, this time to the de Young Museum in San Francisco. The de Young Museum was loaned a number of colossal heals for its Olmec: Colossal Masterworks of Ancient Mexico exhibition, which ran from 19 February to 8 May 2011.de Young Museum 2011.
