The Amiskwi River is an approximately 27.1 km river in British Columbia.1 It is a tributary of the Kicking Horse River. The name Amiskwi is a Cree word for Beavertail. Ironically, just like there is an Otterhead River &amp; Ottertail River (both of which join the Kicking Horse downstream from the Amiskwi), there is also a Beaverfoot River (also a Kicking Horse River tributary) to go with the Beavertail River, which is an old name for the Amiskwi. Another old name of the river is the North Branch Kicking Horse River.
Course
The Amiskwi River is the longest tributary of the Kicking Horse River, beginning at Amiskwi Pass2 and flowing south for about 17.7 km then southeast for about 11.5 km until its confluence with the Kicking Horse River at almost the exact same location as the mouth of the Emerald River. While it is the Kicking Horse&lt;U+2019&gt;s longest tributary it isn&lt;U+2019&gt;t the largest since the Amiskwi doesn&lt;U+2019&gt;t actually carry all that much water.
