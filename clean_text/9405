John Sidney McCain III (born August 29, 1936) is the senior United States Senator from Arizona. He was the Republican nominee for president in the 2008 United States election.
McCain followed his father and grandfather, both four-star admirals, into the United States Navy, graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958. He became a naval aviator, flying ground-attack aircraft from aircraft carriers. During the Vietnam War, he nearly lost his life in the 1967 USS Forrestal fire. In October 1967, while on a bombing mission over Hanoi, he was shot down, seriously injured, and captured by the North Vietnamese. He was a prisoner of war until 1973. McCain experienced episodes of torture, and refused an out-of-sequence early repatriation offer. His war wounds left him with lifelong physical limitations.
He retired from the Navy as a captain in 1981 and moved to Arizona, where he entered politics. Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982, he served two terms, and was then elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986, winning re-election easily four times, most recently in 2010. While generally adhering to conservative principles, McCain at times has had a media reputation as a &quot;maverick&quot; for his willingness to disagree with his party on certain issues. After being investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as a member of the Keating Five, he made campaign finance reform one of his signature concerns, which eventually led to the passage of the McCain-Feingold Act in 2002. He is also known for his work towards restoring diplomatic relations with Vietnam in the 1990s, and for his belief that the war in Iraq should be fought to a successful conclusion. McCain has chaired the Senate Commerce Committee, has opposed spending that he considered to be pork barrel, and played a key role in alleviating a crisis over judicial nominations.
McCain ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 but lost a heated primary contest to George W. Bush. He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early reversals, but lost to Democratic candidate Barack Obama in the general election.
Early life and military career, 1936&lt;U+2013&gt;1981

Formative years and education
John McCain was born on August 29, 1936 at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone, to naval officer John S. McCain, Jr. (1911&lt;U+2013&gt;1981) and Roberta (Wright) McCain (b. 1912).1 At that time, the Panama Canal was under U.S. control.2
McCain's family tree includes Scots-Irish and English ancestors.3 His father and his paternal grandfather, John S. McCain, Sr., both became four-star United States Navy admirals.4 His family, including his older sister Sandy and younger brother Joe,5 followed his father to various naval postings in the United States and the Pacific.6 Altogether, he attended about 20 schools.7
In 1951, the family settled in Northern Virginia, and McCain attended Episcopal High School, a private preparatory boarding school in Alexandria.8 He excelled at wrestling and graduated in 1954.9
Following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, McCain entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. There, he was a friend and informal leader for many of his classmates,10 and sometimes stood up for targets of bullying.11 He also became a lightweight boxer.12 McCain came into conflict with higher-ranking personnel, and he did not always obey the rules, which contributed to a low class rank (894 of 899), despite a high IQ.1314 He did well in academic subjects that interested him, such as literature and history, but studied only enough to pass subjects he struggled with, such as mathematics.1516 McCain graduated in 1958.17
Naval training, first marriage, and Vietnam assignment
John McCain's early military career began when he was commissioned an ensign and started two and a half years of training at Pensacola to become a naval aviator.18 While there, he earned a reputation as a partying man.19 He completed flight school in 1960, and became a naval pilot of ground-attack aircraft, assigned to A-1 Skyraider squadrons20 aboard the aircraft carriers USS Intrepid and USS Enterprise21 in the Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas.22 McCain began as a sub-par flier23 who was at times careless and reckless;24 during the early-to-mid 1960s, the planes he was flying crashed twice and once collided with power lines, but he received no major injuries.25 His aviation skills improved over time,26 and he was seen as a good pilot, albeit one who tended to &quot;push the envelope&quot; in his flying.27
On July 3, 1965, McCain married Carol Shepp, a model originally from Philadelphia.28 McCain adopted her two young children Douglas and Andrew.2930 He and Carol then had a daughter named Sidney.3132
McCain requested a combat assignment,33 and was assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal flying A-4 Skyhawks.34 His combat duty began when he was 30 years old, in mid-1967, when Forrestal was assigned to a bombing campaign, Operation Rolling Thunder, during the Vietnam War.3536 McCain and his fellow pilots became frustrated by micromanagement from Washington, and he would later write that &quot;In all candor, we thought our civilian commanders were complete idiots who didn't have the least notion of what it took to win the war.&quot;3738
On July 29, 1967 McCain, by then a lieutenant commander, was near the center of the Forrestal fire. He escaped from his burning jet and was trying to help another pilot escape when a bomb exploded;39 McCain was struck in the legs and chest by fragments.40 The ensuing fire killed 134 sailors and took 24 hours to control.4142 With the Forrestal out of commission, McCain volunteered for assignment with the USS Oriskany, another aircraft carrier employed in Operation Rolling Thunder.43 Once there, he would be awarded the Navy Commendation Medal and the Bronze Star for missions flown over North Vietnam.44
Prisoner of war
John McCain's capture and subsequent imprisonment began on October 26, 1967. He was flying his 23rd bombing mission over North Vietnam when his A-4E Skyhawk was shot down by a missile over Hanoi.4546 McCain fractured both arms and a leg ejecting from the aircraft,47 and nearly drowned when he parachuted into Truc Bach Lake.48 Some North Vietnamese pulled him ashore, then others crushed his shoulder with a rifle butt and bayoneted him.49 McCain was then transported to Hanoi's main Hoa Lo Prison, nicknamed the &quot;Hanoi Hilton&quot;.50
Although McCain was badly wounded, his captors refused to treat his injuries, beating and interrogating him to get information; he was given medical care only when the North Vietnamese discovered that his father was a top admiral.51 His status as a prisoner of war (POW) made the front pages of major newspapers.5253
McCain spent six weeks in the hospital while receiving marginal care.54 By then having lost , in a chest cast, and with his hair turned white,55 McCain was sent to a different camp on the outskirts of Hanoi56 in December 1967, into a cell with two other Americans who did not expect him to live a week.57 In March 1968, McCain was put into solitary confinement, where he would remain for two years.58
In mid-1968, John S. McCain, Jr. was named commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater, and the North Vietnamese offered McCain early release59 because they wanted to appear merciful for propaganda purposes,60 and also to show other POWs that elite prisoners were willing to be treated preferentially.61 McCain turned down the offer; he would only accept repatriation if every man taken in before him was released as well. Such early release was prohibited by the POW's interpretation of the military Code of Conduct: To prevent the enemy from using prisoners for propaganda, officers were to agree to be released in the order in which they were captured.62
In August 1968, a program of severe torture began on McCain.63 He was subjected to rope bindings and repeated beatings every two hours, at the same time as he was suffering from dysentery.6465 Further injuries led to the beginning of a suicide attempt, stopped by guards.66 After four days, McCain made an anti-American propaganda &quot;confession&quot;.67 He has always felt that his statement was dishonorable, but as he later wrote, &quot;I had learned what we all learned over there: Every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine.&quot;6869 Many American POWs were tortured and maltreated in order to extract &quot;confessions&quot; and propaganda statements, with many enduring even longer and worse treatment;70 virtually all of them eventually yielded something to their captors.71 McCain subsequently received two to three beatings weekly because of his continued refusal to sign additional statements.72
McCain refused to meet with various anti-war groups seeking peace in Hanoi, wanting to give neither them nor the North Vietnamese a propaganda victory.73 From late 1969 onward, treatment of McCain and many of the other POWs became more tolerable,74 while McCain continued actively to resist the camp authorities.75 McCain and other prisoners cheered the U.S. &quot;Christmas Bombing&quot; campaign of December 1972, viewing it as a forceful measure to push North Vietnam to terms.7677
Altogether, McCain was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for five and a half years. He was released on March 14, 1973.78 His wartime injuries left him permanently incapable of raising his arms above his head.79
Commanding officer, liaison to Senate, and second marriage
McCain's return to the United States reunited him with his family. His wife Carol had suffered her own crippling ordeal due to an automobile accident in December 1969.80 McCain became a celebrity of sorts, as a returned POW.81
McCain underwent treatment for his injuries, including months of grueling physical therapy,82 and attended the National War College at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. during 1973&lt;U+2013&gt;1974.83 Having been rehabilitated, by late 1974, McCain had his flight status reinstated, and in 1976 he became commanding officer of a training squadron stationed in Florida.8485 He improved the unit's flight readiness and safety records,86 and won the squadron its first-ever Meritorious Unit Commendation.87 During this period in Florida, McCain had extramarital affairs, and the McCains' marriage began to falter, for which he later would accept blame.8889
McCain served as the Navy's liaison to the U.S. Senate beginning in 1977.90 In retrospect, he has said that this represented his &quot;real entry into the world of politics and the beginning of my second career as a public servant.&quot;91 His key behind-the-scenes role gained congressional financing for a new supercarrier against the wishes of the Carter administration.9293
In April 1979,94 McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley, a teacher from Phoenix, Arizona, whose father had founded a large beer distributorship.95 They began dating, and he urged his wife Carol to grant him a divorce, which she did in February 1980, with the uncontested divorce taking effect in April 1980.9697 The settlement included two houses, and financial support for her ongoing medical treatments due to her 1969 car accident; they would remain on good terms.98 McCain and Hensley were married on May 17, 1980, with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart attending as groomsmen.99100 McCain&lt;U+2019&gt;s children did not attend, and several years would pass before they reconciled.101102 John and Cindy McCain entered into a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name; they would always keep their finances apart and file separate income tax returns.103
McCain decided to leave the Navy. It was doubtful whether he would ever be promoted to the rank of full admiral, as he had poor annual physicals and had been given no major sea command.104 His chances of being promoted to rear admiral were better, but McCain declined that prospect, as he had already made plans to run for Congress and said he could &quot;do more good there.&quot;105106 McCain retired from the Navy on April 1, 1981107 as a captain.108 He was designated as disabled and awarded a disability pension.109 Upon leaving the military, he moved to Arizona. His 17 military awards and decorations include the Silver Star, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross, Bronze Star and Navy Commendation Medal, for actions before, during, and after his time as a POW.110
House and Senate elections and career, 1982&lt;U+2013&gt;2000


U.S. Congressman
McCain set his sights on becoming a Congressman because he was interested in current events, was ready for a new challenge, and had developed political ambitions during his time as Senate liaison.111112113 Living in Phoenix, he went to work for Hensley &amp; Co., his new father-in-law Jim Hensley's large Anheuser-Busch beer distributorship.114 As Vice President of Public Relations at the distributorship, he gained political support among the local business community, meeting powerful figures such as banker Charles Keating, Jr., real estate developer Fife Symington III and newspaper publisher Darrow &quot;Duke&quot; Tully.115116 In 1982, McCain ran as a Republican for an open seat in Arizona's 1st congressional district.117 A newcomer to the state, McCain was hit with charges of being a carpetbagger.118 McCain responded to a voter making that charge with what a Phoenix Gazette columnist would later describe as &quot;the most devastating response to a potentially troublesome political issue I've ever heard&quot;:119

With the assistance of local political endorsements, his Washington connections, as well as money that his wife lent to his campaign,120 McCain won a highly contested primary election.121 He then easily won the general election in the heavily Republican district.122
In 1983, McCain was elected to lead the incoming group of Republican representatives,123 and was assigned to the House Committee on Interior Affairs. Also that year, he opposed creation of a federal Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, but admitted in 2008: &quot;I was wrong and eventually realized that, in time to give full support [in 1990] for a state holiday in Arizona.&quot;124125
McCain's politics at this point were mainly in line with President Ronald Reagan, including support for Reaganomics, and he was active on Indian Affairs bills.126 He supported most aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including its hardline stance against the Soviet Union and policy towards Central American conflicts, such as backing the Contras in Nicaragua.127 McCain opposed keeping U.S. Marines deployed in Lebanon citing unattainable objectives, and subsequently criticized President Reagan for pulling out the troops too late; in the interim, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing killed hundreds.128129 McCain won re-election to the House easily in 1984,130 and gained a spot on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.131 In 1985, he made his first return trip to Vietnam,132 and also traveled to Chile where he met with its military junta ruler, General Augusto Pinochet.133134135
Growing family
In 1984, McCain and Cindy had their first child together, daughter Meghan, followed two years later by son John Sidney (Jack) IV, and in 1988 by son James (Jimmy).136 In 1991, Cindy McCain brought an abandoned three-month old girl needing medical treatment to the U.S. from a Bangladeshi orphanage run by Mother Teresa.137 The McCains decided to adopt her and named her Bridget.138
First two terms in U.S. Senate
McCain's Senate career began in January 1987, after he defeated his Democratic opponent, former state legislator Richard Kimball, by 20 percentage points in the 1986 election.139140 McCain succeeded longtime American conservative icon and Arizona fixture Barry Goldwater upon the latter's retirement as United States Senator from Arizona.141
 Senator McCain became a member of the Armed Services Committee, with which he had formerly done his Navy liaison work; he also joined the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee.142 McCain continued to support the Native American agenda.143 As first a House member and then a senator &lt;U+2013&gt; and as a life-long gambler with close ties to the gambling industry144 &lt;U+2013&gt; McCain was one of the main authors of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act,145146 which codified rules regarding Native American gambling enterprises.147 McCain was also a strong supporter of the Gramm-Rudman legislation that enforced automatic spending cuts in the case of budget deficits.148
McCain soon gained national visibility. He delivered a well-received speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention, was mentioned by the press as a short list vice-presidential running mate for Republican nominee George H. W. Bush, and was named chairman of Veterans for Bush.149150
McCain became enmeshed in a scandal during the 1980s as one of five United States Senators comprising the so-called Keating Five.151 Between 1982 and 1987, McCain had received $112,000 in lawful152 political contributions from Charles Keating Jr. and his associates at Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, along with trips on Keating's jets153 that McCain belatedly repaid in 1989.154 In 1987, McCain was one of the five senators whom Keating contacted in order to prevent the government's seizure of Lincoln, and McCain met twice with federal regulators to discuss the government's investigation of Lincoln.155 In 1999, McCain said: &quot;The appearance of it was wrong. It's a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators, because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence. And it was the wrong thing to do.&quot;156 In the end, McCain was cleared by the Senate Ethics Committee of acting improperly or violating any law or Senate rule, but was mildly rebuked for exercising &quot;poor judgment&quot;.157158 In his 1992 re-election bid, the Keating Five affair was not a major issue,159 and he won handily, gaining 56 percent of the vote to defeat Democratic community and civil rights activist Claire Sargent and independent former Governor Evan Mecham.160
 McCain developed a reputation for independence during the 1990s.161 He took pride in challenging party leadership and establishment forces, becoming difficult to categorize politically.162
As a member of the 1991&lt;U+2013&gt;1993 Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, chaired by Democrat and fellow Vietnam War veteran John Kerry, McCain investigated the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue, to determine the fate of U.S. service personnel listed as missing in action during the Vietnam War.163 The committee's unanimous report stated there was &quot;no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia.&quot;164 Helped by McCain's efforts, in 1995 the U.S. normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam.165 McCain was vilified by some POW/MIA activists who, unlike the Arizona senator, believed large numbers of Americans were still held against their will in Southeast Asia.166167168 Since January 1993, McCain has been Chairman of the International Republican Institute, an organization partly funded by the U.S. Government that supports the emergence of political democracy worldwide.169
In 1993 and 1994, McCain voted to confirm President Clinton's nominees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg whom he considered to be qualified for the U.S. Supreme Court. He would later explain that &quot;under our Constitution, it is the president's call to make.&quot;170 McCain had also voted to confirm nominees of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, including Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.171
McCain attacked what he saw as the corrupting influence of large political contributions &lt;U+2013&gt; from corporations, labor unions, other organizations, and wealthy individuals &lt;U+2013&gt; and he made this his signature issue.172 Starting in 1994, he worked with Democratic Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold on campaign finance reform; their McCain-Feingold bill attempted to put limits on &quot;soft money&quot;.173 The efforts of McCain and Feingold were opposed by some of the moneyed interests targeted, by incumbents in both parties, by those who felt spending limits impinged on free political speech and might be unconstitutional as well, and by those who wanted to counterbalance the power of what they saw as media bias.174175 Despite sympathetic coverage in the media, initial versions of the McCain-Feingold Act were filibustered and never came to a vote.176
The term &quot;maverick Republican&quot; became a label frequently applied to McCain, and he has also used it himself.177178179 In 1993, McCain opposed military operations in Somalia.180 Another target of his was pork barrel spending by Congress, and he actively supported the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, which gave the president power to veto individual spending items181 but was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1998.182
In the 1996 presidential election, McCain was again on the short list of possible vice-presidential picks, this time for Republican nominee Bob Dole.183184 The following year, Time magazine named McCain as one of the &quot;25 Most Influential People in America&quot;.185
 In 1997, McCain became chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee's purview, but in response said the small contributions he received were not part of the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem.186 McCain took on the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns, discourage teenage smokers, increase money for health research studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs.187188 Supported by the Clinton administration but opposed by the industry and most Republicans, the bill failed to gain cloture.189
Start of third term in the U.S. Senate
McCain won re-election to a third senate term in November 1998, prevailing in a landslide over his Democratic opponent, environmental lawyer Ed Ranger.190 In the February 1999 Senate trial following the impeachment of Bill Clinton, McCain voted to convict the president on both the perjury and obstruction of justice counts, saying Clinton had violated his sworn oath of office.191 In March 1999, McCain voted to approve the NATO bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, saying that the ongoing genocide of the Kosovo War must be stopped and criticizing past Clinton administration inaction.192 Later in 1999, McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Feingold for their work in trying to enact their campaign finance reform,193 although the bill was still failing repeated attempts to gain cloture.194
In August 1999, McCain's memoir Faith of My Fathers, co-authored with Mark Salter, was published;195 a reviewer observed that its appearance &quot;seems to have been timed to the unfolding Presidential campaign.&quot;196 The most successful of his writings, it received positive reviews,197 became a bestseller,198 and was later made into a TV film. The book traces McCain's family background and childhood, covers his time at Annapolis and his service before and during the Vietnam War, concluding with his release from captivity in 1973. According to one reviewer, it describes &quot;the kind of challenges that most of us can barely imagine. It's a fascinating history of a remarkable military family.&quot;199
2000 presidential campaign

McCain announced his candidacy for president on September 27, 1999 in Nashua, New Hampshire, saying he was staging &quot;a fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests, and return it to the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve&quot;.200201 The leader for the Republican nomination was Texas Governor George W. Bush, who had the political and financial support of most of the party establishment.202
McCain focused on the New Hampshire primary, where his message appealed to independents.203 He traveled on a campaign bus called the Straight Talk Express.204 He held many town hall meetings, answering every question voters asked, in a successful example of &quot;retail politics&quot;, and he used free media to compensate for his lack of funds.205 One reporter later recounted that, &quot;McCain talked all day long with reporters on his Straight Talk Express bus; he talked so much that sometimes he said things that he shouldn't have, and that's why the media loved him.&quot;206 On February 1, 2000, he won New Hampshire's primary with 49 percent of the vote to Bush's 30 percent. The Bush campaign and the Republican establishment feared that a McCain victory in the crucial South Carolina primary might give his campaign unstoppable momentum.207208
The Arizona Republic would write that the McCain&lt;U+2013&gt;Bush primary contest in South Carolina &quot;has entered national political lore as a low-water mark in presidential campaigns&quot;, while The New York Times called it &quot;a painful symbol of the brutality of American politics&quot;.209210211 A variety of interest groups that McCain had challenged in the past ran negative ads.212213 Bush borrowed McCain's earlier language of reform,214 and declined to dissociate himself from a veterans activist who accused McCain (in Bush's presence) of having &quot;abandoned the veterans&quot; on POW/MIA and Agent Orange issues.215216
Incensed,217 McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton, which Bush said was &quot;about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary&quot;.218 An anonymous smear campaign began against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, and audience plants.219220 The smears claimed that McCain had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter was adopted from Bangladesh), that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, that he was a homosexual, and that he was a &quot;Manchurian Candidate&quot; who was either a traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days.221222 The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with the attacks.223
McCain lost South Carolina on February 19, with 42 percent of the vote to Bush's 53 percent,224 in part because Bush mobilized the state's evangelical voters225226 and outspent McCain.227 The win allowed Bush to regain lost momentum.228 McCain would say of the rumor spreaders, &quot;I believe that there is a special place in hell for people like those.&quot;229 According to one report, the South Carolina experience left McCain in a &quot;very dark place&quot;.230
McCain's campaign never completely recovered from his South Carolina defeat, although he did rebound partially by winning in Arizona and Michigan a few days later.231 He made a speech in Virginia Beach that criticized Christian leaders, including Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, as divisive conservatives,232 declaring &quot;... we embrace the fine members of the religious conservative community. But that does not mean that we will pander to their self-appointed leaders.&quot;233 McCain lost the Virginia primary on February 29,234 and on March 7 lost nine of the thirteen primaries on Super Tuesday to Bush.235 With little hope of overcoming Bush's delegate lead, McCain withdrew from the race on March 9, 2000.236 He endorsed Bush two months later,237 and made occasional appearances with the Texas governor during the general election campaign.238
Senate career after 2000

Remainder of third Senate term
McCain began 2001 by breaking with the new George W. Bush administration on a number of matters, including HMO reform, climate change, and gun legislation; McCain-Feingold was opposed by Bush as well.239240 In May 2001, McCain was one of only two Senate Republicans to vote against the Bush tax cuts.241242 Besides the differences with Bush on ideological grounds, there was considerable antagonism between the two remaining from the previous year's campaign.243244 Later, when Republican Senator Jim Jeffords became an Independent, throwing control of the Senate to the Democrats, McCain defended Jeffords against &quot;self-appointed enforcers of party loyalty&quot;.245 Indeed, there was speculation at the time, and in years since, about McCain himself leaving the Republican Party, but McCain has always adamantly denied that he ever considered doing so.246247248 Beginning in 2001, McCain used political capital gained from his presidential run, as well as improved legislative skills and relationships with other members, to become one of the Senate's most influential members.249
 After the September 11, 2001 attacks, McCain supported Bush and the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.250251 He and then-Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman wrote the legislation that created the 9/11 Commission,252 while he and Democratic Senator Fritz Hollings co-sponsored the Aviation and Transportation Security Act that federalized airport security.253
In March 2002, McCain-Feingold passed in both Houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Bush.254255 Seven years in the making, it was McCain's greatest legislative achievement.256257
Meanwhile, in discussions over proposed U.S. action against Iraq, McCain was a strong supporter of the Bush administration's position.258 He stated that Iraq was &quot;a clear and present danger to the United States of America&quot;, and voted accordingly for the Iraq War Resolution in October 2002.259 He predicted that U.S. forces would be treated as liberators by a large number of the Iraqi people.260 In May 2003, McCain voted against the second round of Bush tax cuts, saying it was unwise at a time of war.261 By November 2003, after a trip to Iraq, he was publicly questioning Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, saying that more U.S. troops were needed; the following year, McCain announced that he had lost confidence in Rumsfeld.262263
In October 2003, McCain and Lieberman co-sponsored the Climate Stewardship Act that would have introduced a cap and trade system aimed at returning greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels; the bill was defeated with 55 votes to 43 in the Senate.264 They reintroduced modified versions of the Act two additional times, most recently in January 2007 with the co-sponsorship of Barack Obama, among others.265
In the 2004 U.S. presidential election campaign, McCain was once again frequently mentioned for the vice-presidential slot, only this time as part of the Democratic ticket under nominee John Kerry.266267268 McCain said that Kerry had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have accepted it if he had.269270271 At the 2004 Republican National Convention, McCain supported Bush for re-election, praising Bush's management of the War on Terror since the September 11 attacks.272 At the same time, the Senator defended Kerry's Vietnam war record.273 By August 2004, McCain had the best favorable-to-unfavorable rating (55 percent to 19 percent) of any national politician;274 he campaigned for Bush much more than he had four years previously, though the two remained situational allies rather than friends.275
McCain was also up for re-election as Senator in 2004. He defeated little-known Democratic schoolteacher Stuart Starky with his biggest margin of victory, garnering 77 percent of the vote.276
Start of fourth Senate term
 In May 2005, McCain led the so-called Gang of 14 in the Senate, which established a compromise that preserved the ability of senators to filibuster judicial nominees, but only in &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot;.277 The compromise took the steam out of the filibuster movement, but some Republicans remained disappointed that the compromise did not eliminate filibusters of judicial nominees in all circumstances.278 McCain subsequently cast Supreme Court confirmation votes in favor of John Roberts and Samuel Alito, calling them &quot;two of the finest justices ever appointed to the United States Supreme Court.&quot;279
Breaking from his 2001 and 2003 votes, McCain supported the Bush tax cut extension in May 2006, saying not to do so would amount to a tax increase.280 Working with Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy, McCain was a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform, which would involve legalization, guest worker programs, and border enforcement components. The Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act was never voted on in 2005, while the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 passed the Senate in May 2006 but failed in the House.281 In June 2007, President Bush, McCain, and others made the strongest push yet for such a bill, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, but it aroused intense grassroots opposition among talk radio listeners and others, some of whom furiously characterized the proposal as an &quot;amnesty&quot; program,282 and the bill twice failed to gain cloture in the Senate.283
By the mid-2000s decade, the increased Indian gaming that McCain had helped bring about was a $23 billion industry.284 He was twice chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, in 1995&lt;U+2013&gt;1997 and 2005&lt;U+2013&gt;2007, and his Committee helped expose the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal.285286 By 2005 and 2006, McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that would limit creation of off-reservation casinos,287 as well as limiting the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos.288
 Owing to his time as a POW, McCain has been recognized for his sensitivity to the detention and interrogation of detainees in the War on Terror. In October 2005, McCain introduced the McCain Detainee Amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill for 2005, and the Senate voted 90&lt;U+2013&gt;9 to support the amendment.289 It prohibits inhumane treatment of prisoners, including prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, by confining military interrogations to the techniques in the U.S. Army Field Manual on Interrogation. Although Bush had threatened to veto the bill if McCain's amendment was included,290 the President announced in December 2005 that he accepted McCain's terms and would &quot;make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture, whether it be here at home or abroad&quot;.291 This stance, among others, led to McCain being named by Time magazine in 2006 as one of America's 10 Best Senators.292 McCain voted in February 2008 against a bill containing a ban on waterboarding,293 which provision was later narrowly passed and vetoed by Bush. However, the bill in question contained other provisions to which McCain objected, and his spokesman stated: &quot;This wasn't a vote on waterboarding. This was a vote on applying the standards of the [Army] field manual to CIA personnel.&quot;294
Meanwhile, McCain continued questioning the progress of the war in Iraq. In September 2005, he remarked upon Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers' optimistic outlook on the war's progress: &quot;Things have not gone as well as we had planned or expected, nor as we were told by you, General Myers.&quot;295 In August 2006, he criticized the administration for continually understating the effectiveness of the insurgency: &quot;We [have] not told the American people how tough and difficult this could be.&quot;296 From the beginning, McCain strongly supported the Iraq troop surge of 2007.297 The strategy's opponents labeled it &quot;McCain's plan&quot;298 and University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato said, &quot;McCain owns Iraq just as much as Bush does now.&quot;299 The surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year, even within the Republican Party,300 as McCain's presidential campaign was underway; faced with the consequences, McCain frequently responded, &quot;I would much rather lose a campaign than a war.&quot;301 In March 2008, McCain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in Iraq, as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began.302
2008 presidential campaign

 John McCain formally announced his intention to run for President of the United States on April 25, 2007 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.303 He stated that: &quot;I'm not running for President to be somebody, but to do something; to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and needless things.&quot;304
McCain's oft-cited strengths as a presidential candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives, his ability to reach across the aisle, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers.305 During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346 events306 and helped raise more than $10.5 million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions, while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make.307 Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began,308 McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls as the year progressed.
McCain had fundraising problems in the first half of 2007, due in part to his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was unpopular among the Republican base electorate.309310 Large-scale campaign staff downsizing took place in early July, but McCain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race.311 Later that month, the candidate's campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed.312 McCain slumped badly in national polls, often running third or fourth with 15 percent or less support.
The Arizona senator subsequently resumed his familiar position as a political underdog,313 riding the Straight Talk Express and taking advantage of free media such as debates and sponsored events.314 By December 2007, the Republican race was unsettled, with none of the top-tier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major vulnerabilities with different elements of the Republican base electorate.315 McCain was showing a resurgence, in particular with renewed strength in New Hampshire &lt;U+2013&gt; the scene of his 2000 triumph &lt;U+2013&gt; and was bolstered further by the endorsements of The Boston Globe, the New Hampshire Union Leader, and almost two dozen other state newspapers,316 as well as from Independent Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman.317318 McCain decided not to campaign significantly in the January 3, 2008, Iowa caucuses, which saw a win by former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee.
McCain's comeback plan paid off when he won the New Hampshire primary on January 8, defeating former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney in a close contest, to once again become one of the front-runners in the race.319 In mid-January, McCain placed first in the South Carolina primary, narrowly defeating Mike Huckabee.320 Pundits credited the third-place finisher, Tennessee's former U.S. Senator Fred Thompson, with drawing votes from Huckabee in South Carolina, thereby giving a narrow win to McCain.321 A week later, McCain won the Florida primary,322 beating Romney again in a close contest; Giuliani then dropped out and endorsed McCain.323
On February 5, McCain won both the majority of states and delegates in the Super Tuesday Republican primaries, giving him a commanding lead toward the Republican nomination. Romney departed from the race on February 7.324 McCain's wins in the March 4 primaries clinched a majority of the delegates, and he became the presumptive Republican nominee.325
McCain, having been born in the (Panama) Canal Zone, if elected would have become the first president who was born outside the current 50 states. This raised a potential legal issue, since the United States Constitution requires the president to be a natural-born citizen of the United States. A bipartisan legal review326 and a unanimous but non-binding Senate resolution327 both concluded that he is a natural-born citizen. Also, if inaugurated in 2009 at age 72 years and 144 days, he would have been the oldest U.S. president upon ascension to the presidency,328 and the second-oldest president to be inaugurated.329  McCain has addressed concerns about his age and past health concerns, stating in 2005 that his health was &quot;excellent&quot;.330 He has been treated for a type of skin cancer called melanoma, and an operation in 2000 for that condition left a noticeable mark on the left side of his face.331 McCain's prognosis appears favorable, according to independent experts, especially because he has already survived without a recurrence for more than seven years.332 In May 2008, McCain's campaign briefly let the press review his medical records, and he was described as appearing cancer-free, having a strong heart and in general good health.333
Upon clinching enough delegates for the nomination, McCain's focus shifted toward the general election, while Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton fought a prolonged battle for the Democratic nomination.334 McCain introduced various policy proposals, and sought to improve his fundraising.335336 Cindy McCain, who accounts for most of the couple's wealth with an estimated net worth of $100 million,337 made part of her tax returns public in May.338 After facing criticism about lobbyists on staff, the McCain campaign issued new rules in May 2008 to avoid conflicts of interest, causing five top aides to leave.339340
 When Obama became the Democrats' presumptive nominee in early June, McCain proposed joint town hall meetings, but Obama instead requested more traditional debates for the fall.341 In July, a staff shake-up put Steve Schmidt in full operational control of the McCain campaign.342 Throughout these summer months, Obama typically led McCain in national polls by single-digit margins,343 and also led in several key swing states.344 McCain reprised his familiar underdog role, which was due at least in part to the overall challenges Republicans faced in the election year.345346 McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that go with it, while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976.347348 The Republican's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead, compared to Obama's.349
Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was revealed as McCain's surprise choice for running mate on August 29, 2008.350 McCain was only the second U.S. major-party presidential nominee to select a woman for running mate and the first Republican to do so; Palin would have become the first female Vice President of the United States if she had been elected. On September 3, 2008, McCain and Palin became the Republican Party's Presidential and Vice Presidential nominees, respectively, at the 2008 Republican National Convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota. McCain surged ahead of Obama in national polls following the convention, as the Palin pick energized core Republican voters who had previously been wary of him.351 However, by the campaign's own later admission, the rollout of Palin to the national media went poorly,352 and voter reactions to Palin grew increasingly negative, especially among independents and other voters concerned about her qualifications.353
On September 24, McCain said he was suspending his campaign, called on Obama to join him, and proposed delaying the first of the general election debates with Obama, in order to work on the proposed U.S. financial system bailout before Congress, which was targeted at addressing the subprime mortgage crisis and liquidity crisis.354355 McCain's intervention helped to give dissatisfied House Republicans an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement.356357 After Obama declined McCain's suspension suggestion, McCain went ahead with the debate on September 26.358 On October 1, McCain voted in favor of a revised $700 billion rescue plan.359 Another debate was held on October 7; like the first one, polls afterward suggested that Obama had won it.360 A final presidential debate occurred on October 15.361 During and after it, McCain compared Obama's proposed policies to socialism and often invoked &quot;Joe the Plumber&quot; as a symbol of American small business dreams that would be thwarted by an Obama presidency.362363 McCain barred using the Jeremiah Wright controversy in ads against Obama,364 but the campaign did frequently criticize Obama regarding his purported relationship with Bill Ayers.365 Down the stretch, McCain was outspent by Obama by a four-to-one margin.366
The election took place on November 4, and Barack Obama was projected the winner at about 11:00 pm Eastern Standard Time; McCain delivered his concession speech in Phoenix, Arizona about twenty minutes later.367 In it, he noted the historic and special significance of Obama becoming the nation's first African American president.368 In the end, McCain won 173 electoral college votes to Obama's 365;369 McCain failed to win most of the battleground states and lost some traditionally Republican ones.370 McCain gained 46 percent of the nationwide popular vote, compared to Obama's 53 percent.371
Senate career after 2008
Remainder of fourth Senate term
Following his defeat, McCain returned to the Senate amid varying views about what role he might play there.372 In mid-November 2008 he met with President-elect Obama, and the two discussed issues they had commonality on.373 Around the same time, McCain indicated that he intended to run for re-election to his Senate seat in 2010.374 As the inauguration neared, Obama consulted with McCain on a variety of matters, to an extent rarely seen between a president-elect and his defeated rival,375 and President Obama's inauguration speech contained an allusion to McCain's theme of finding a purpose greater than oneself.376
Nevertheless, McCain emerged as a leader of the Republican opposition to the Obama economic stimulus package of 2009, saying it had too much spending for too little stimulative effect.377 McCain also voted against Obama's Supreme Court nomination of Sonia Sotomayor &lt;U+2013&gt; saying that while undeniably qualified, &quot;I do not believe that she shares my belief in judicial restraint&quot;378 &lt;U+2013&gt; and by August 2009 was siding more often with his Republican Party on closely divided votes than ever before in his senatorial career.379 McCain reasserted that the Afghanistan War was winnable380 and criticized Obama for a slow process in deciding whether to send additional U.S. troops there.381 McCain also harshly criticized Obama for scrapping construction of the U.S. missile defense complex in Poland, declined to enter negotiations over climate change legislation similar to what he had proposed in the past, and strongly opposed the Obama health care plan.382383 McCain led a successful filibuster of a measure that would allow repeal of the military's &quot;Don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy towards gays.384 Factors involved in McCain's new direction included Senate staffers leaving, a renewed concern over national debt levels and the scope of federal government, a possible Republican primary challenge from conservatives in 2010, and McCain's campaign edge being slow to wear off.385386 As one longtime McCain advisor said, &quot;A lot of people, including me, thought he might be the Republican building bridges to the Obama Administration. But he's been more like the guy blowing up the bridges.&quot;387
In early 2010, a primary challenge from radio talk show host and former U.S. Congressman J. D. Hayworth materialized in the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Arizona and drew support from some but not all elements of the Tea Party movement.388389 With Hayworth using the campaign slogan &quot;The Consistent Conservative&quot;, McCain said (despite his own past use of the term),390 &quot;I never considered myself a maverick. I consider myself a person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities.&quot;391 The primary challenge coincided with McCain reversing or muting his stance on some issues such as the bank bailouts, closing of the Guant&lt;U+00E1&gt;namo Bay detention facility, campaign finance restrictions, and gays in the military.392 When the health care plan, now called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed Congress and became law in March 2010, McCain strongly opposed the landmark legislation not only on its merits but also on the way it had been handled in Congress. As a consequence, he warned that congressional Republicans would not be working with Democrats on anything else: &quot;There will be no cooperation for the rest of the year. They have poisoned the well in what they've done and how they've done it.&quot;393 McCain became a vocal defender of Arizona SB 1070, the April 2010 tough anti-illegal immigration state law that aroused national controversy, saying that the state had been forced to take action given the federal government's inability to control the border.394395 In the August 24 primary, McCain beat Hayworth by a 56 to 32 percent margin.396 McCain proceeded to easily defeat Democratic city councilman Rodney Glassman in the general election.397
In the lame duck session of the 111th Congress, McCain voted for the compromise Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, but against the DREAM Act (which he had once sponsored) and the New START Treaty. Most prominently, he continued to lead the eventually losing fight against &quot;Don't ask, don't tell&quot; repeal, with his opposition .398 In his opposition, he sometimes fell into anger or hostility on the Senate floor, and called its passage &quot;a very sad day&quot; that would compromise the battle effectiveness of the military.399
Political positions

 Various advocacy groups have given Senator McCain scores or grades as to how well his votes align with the positions of each group.400 The American Conservative Union awarded McCain a lifetime rating of 82 percent through 2009, while McCain has an average lifetime 13 percent &quot;Liberal Quotient&quot; from Americans for Democratic Action through 2009.401402
The Almanac of American Politics rates congressional votes as liberal or conservative on the political spectrum, in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005&lt;U+2013&gt;2006, McCain's average ratings were as follows: the economic rating 59 percent conservative and 41 percent liberal, the social rating 54 percent conservative / 38 percent liberal, and the foreign rating 56 percent conservative / 43 percent liberal.403
Columnists such as Robert Robb and Matthew Continetti have used a formulation devised by William F. Buckley, Jr. to describe McCain as &quot;conservative&quot; but not &quot;a conservative&quot;, meaning that while McCain usually tends towards conservative positions, he is not &quot;anchored by the philosophical tenets of modern American conservatism.&quot;404405 However, National Journal magazine rated McCain along with seven of his colleagues as the &quot;most conservative&quot; Senators for 2010.406
From the late 1990s until 2008, McCain was a board member of Project Vote Smart (PVS) which was set up by Richard Kimball, his 1986 Senate opponent.407 PVS provides non-partisan information about the political positions of McCain408 and other candidates for political office. Additionally, McCain uses his Senate web site to describe his political positions.409
Cultural and political image

 John McCain's personal character has been a dominant feature of his public image.410 This image includes the military service of both himself and his family,411 his maverick political persona,412 his temper,413 his admitted problem of occasional ill-considered remarks,414 and his close ties to his children from both his marriages.415
McCain's political appeal has been more nonpartisan and less ideological compared to many other national politicians.416 His stature and reputation stem partly from his service in the Vietnam War.417 He also carries physical vestiges of his war wounds, as well as his melanoma surgery.418 When campaigning, he quips: &quot;I am older than dirt and have more scars than Frankenstein.&quot;419
 In his own estimation, the Arizona senator is straightforward and direct, but impatient.420 Other traits include a penchant for lucky charms,421 a fondness for hiking,422 and a sense of humor that has sometimes backfired spectacularly, as when he made a joke in 1998 about the Clintons widely deemed not fit to print in newspapers: &quot;Do you know why Chelsea Clinton is so ugly? &lt;U+2014&gt; Because Janet Reno is her father.&quot;423424 McCain subsequently apologized profusely,425 and the Clinton White House accepted his apology.426 McCain has not shied away from addressing his shortcomings, and apologizing for them.427428 He is known for sometimes being prickly429 and hot-tempered430 with Senate colleagues, but his relations with his own Senate staff have been more cordial, and have inspired loyalty towards him.431432
McCain acknowledges having said intemperate things in years past,433 though he also says that many stories have been exaggerated.434 One psychoanalytic comparison suggests that McCain was not the first presidential candidate to have a temper,435 and cultural critic Julia Keller argues that voters want leaders who are passionate, engaged, fiery, and feisty.436 McCain has employed both profanity437 and shouting on occasion, although such incidents have become less frequent over the years.438439 Senator Joe Lieberman has made this observation: &quot;It is not the kind of anger that is a loss of control. He is a very controlled person.&quot;440 Senator Thad Cochran, who has known McCain for decades and has battled him over earmarks,441442 expressed concern about a McCain presidency: &quot;He is erratic. He is hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me.&quot;443 Ultimately Cochran decided to support McCain for president, after it was clear he would win the nomination.444
All of John McCain's family members are on good terms with him,445 and he has defended them against some of the negative consequences of his high-profile political lifestyle.446447 His family's military tradition extends to the latest generation: son John Sidney IV (&quot;Jack&quot;) graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2009, becoming the fourth generation John S. McCain to do so; son James has served with the Marines in the Iraq War; and son Doug flew jets in the Navy.448449450 His daughter Meghan became a blogging and Twittering presence in the debate about the future of the Republican Party following the 2008 elections, and showed some of his maverick tendencies.451452
