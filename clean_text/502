Myotis alcathoe is a European bat in the genus Myotis. Known only from Greece and Hungary when it was first described in 2001, its known distribution has since expanded to Spain, England, Sweden, and Azerbaijan, among other countries. It is similar to the whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus) and other species and is difficult to distinguish from them. However, its brown fur is distinctive and it is clearly different in characters of its karyotype and DNA sequences. Although some genetic data suggest that it is related to Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus), other analyses do not support a close relationship between M. alcathoe and any other species.
With a forearm length of 30.8 to 34.6 mm (1.2 to 1.4 in) and body mass of 3.5 to 5.5 g (0.1 to 0.2 oz), Myotis alcathoe is a small bat. The fur is usually reddish-brown on the upperparts and brown below, but more grayish in juveniles. The tragus (a projection on the inner side of the ear) is short, as is the ear itself, and the inner side of the ear is pale at the base. The wings are brown and the baculum (penis bone) is short and broad. M. alcathoe has a very high-pitched echolocation call, with a frequency that falls from 120 kHz at the beginning of the call to about 43 kHz at the end.
Usually found in old-growth deciduous forest near water, Myotis alcathoe forages high in the canopy and above water and mostly eats flies. The animal roosts in cavities high in trees. Although there are some winter records from caves, it may also spend the winter in tree cavities. Several parasites have been recorded on M. alcathoe. The IUCN Red List assesses Myotis alcathoe as &quot;Data Deficient&quot;, but it is considered threatened in several areas because of its rarity and vulnerability to habitat loss.
Taxonomy
The whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus) and similar species in Eurasia (collectively known as &quot;whiskered bats&quot;) are difficult to distinguish from each other; for example, the distantly related Brandt's bat (Myotis brandtii) was not recognized as distinct from M. mystacinus until the 1970s.1 Small, unusual M. mystacinus-like bats were first recorded in Greece in the 1970s, but it was not until the advent of genetic studies that these bats could be confirmed as representing a distinct species, named Myotis alcathoe.2 In 2001, the species was described by German zoologists Otto von Helversen and Klaus-Gerhard Heller on the basis of specimens from Greece and Hungary.3 Although it also differs from other whiskered bats by morphological characters, Myotis alcathoe is most clearly distinct in its genetics, including DNA sequences and the location of the nucleolus organizer regions.4
Von Helversen and Heller argued that none of the old names now considered synonyms of M. mystacinus could apply to M. alcathoe, because these names all have their type localities in western or central Europe.5 However, the more recent discovery of M. alcathoe further to the west renders it possible that an older name may be discovered.6 In addition, Russian researcher Suren Gazaryan has suggested that the name caucasicus Tsytsulina, 2000 (originally proposed for a subspecies of M. mystacinus from the Caucasus) may prove to be applicable to M. alcathoe; in that case, the species would be renamed Myotis caucasicus.7 The species may have remained undetected in Germany for so long because bat researchers did not sample its preferred habitats and would dismiss unusual-looking whiskered bats as being abnormal M. mystacinus or M. brandtii.8
On the basis of mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis, Myotis alcathoe was at first thought to be most closely related to Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus) of southern Europe, North Africa, and southwestern Asia.9 However, a study of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene incorporating many Myotis species did not support this relationship, and could not place M. alcathoe securely at a specific position among Eurasian Myotis.10 Two groups with slightly divergent mitochondrial DNA sequences (separated by 1.3 to 1.4% sequence divergence) are distinguishable within the species, which probably correspond to different glacial refugia where M. alcathoe populations survived the last glacial period. One, known as the &quot;Hungarian&quot; group, has been recorded from Spain, France, Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia, and probably corresponds to a refugium in Iberia; the other, the &quot;Greek&quot; group, is known only from Greece and Slovakia.11
The specific name, alcathoe, refers to Alcathoe, a figure from Greek mythology who was turned into a bat when she refused the advances of the god Dionysus. She was associated with gorges and small streams, the preferred habitat of Myotis alcathoe in Greece.12 In their original description, von Helversen and colleagues described her as a nymph,13 and the common name &quot;nymph bat&quot; has therefore been used for this species.14 However, none of the classical sources speak of Alcathoe as a nymph; instead, she was a princess, the daughter of King Minyas of Orchomenos. Therefore, Petr Benda recommended in 2008 that the common name &quot;Alcathoe bat&quot; or &quot;Alcathoe myotis&quot; be used instead.15 Other common names include &quot;Alcathoe's bat&quot;16 and &quot;Alcathoe whiskered bat&quot;.17
Description
 Myotis alcathoe is the smallest European Myotis species. The fur is brownish on the upperparts, with a reddish tone in old specimens, and a slightly paler gray-brown below.18 Younger animals may be completely gray-brown.19 The brown fur distinguishes adult M. alcathoe from other whiskered bats, but juveniles cannot be unambiguously identified on the basis of morphology.20 M. alcathoe is similar to Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) and M. emarginatus in color.21 On the upper side of the body, the hairs are 6 to 8 mm long and have dark bases and brown tips. The hairs on the lower side of the body are only slightly paler at the tip than at the base.22
The face and the upper lips are reddish to pink.23 Although most of the face is hairy, the area around the eyes is bare.24 The nostrils are heart-shaped,25 and their back end is broad, as in M. brandtii, not narrow as in M. mystacinus.26 Several glands are present on the muzzle, most prominently in reproductively active males. The ears are brown and are lighter on the inside than the outside. There is a notch at the edge of the ear, and the pointed tragus (a projection inside the ear that is present in some bats) extends up to this notch.27 The base of the inner side of the ear is white; it is much darker in M. mystacinus.28 The feet and the thumbs are very small. The small size of the ear, tragus, feet, and thumb distinguishes M. alcathoe from the slightly larger M. mystacinus and M. brandtii,29 but the feet are relatively larger than in M. mystacinus.30
The wings are brown, but lighter than those of M. mystacinus.31 The plagiopatagium (the portion of the wing between the last digit and the hindlegs) is attached to the fifth toe. The tail extends only about 1 mm beyond the back margin of the uropatagium (the portion of the wing membrane between the hindlegs). The calcar, a cartilaginous spur supporting the uropatagium, is slender. With a width around 1.3 mm, the penis is narrow, and it lacks a broadened tip. The baculum (penis bone) is about 0.5 mm long.32 The short and broad shape of this bone distinguishes M. alcathoe from M. brandtii as well as M. ikonnikovi.33
The skull is similar in shape to that of M. mystacinus and M. brandtii, but the front part of the braincase is higher. The second and third upper premolars (P2 and P3) are tiny and pressed against the upper canine (C1) and fourth premolar (P4).34 The canine is less well-developed than in M. mystacinus.35 There is a clear cusp present on the side of the P4. The accessory cusp known as the protoconule is present on each of the upper molars when they are unworn. M. mystacinus lacks the P4 cusp and the protoconules on the molars.36
As usual in Myotis species, Myotis alcathoe has a karyotype consisting of 44 chromosomes, with the fundamental number of chromosomal arms equal to 52. However, a 1987 study already found that M. alcathoe (then called &quot;Myotis sp. B&quot;) differs from both M. mystacinus and M. brandtii in the pattern of active nucleolus organizer regions on the chromosomes.37 M. alcathoe also differs from other Myotis species in the sequences of the mitochondrial genes 12S rRNA and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 by at least 5% and 13%, respectively.38
Myotis alcathoe has the highest-frequency echolocation call of any European Myotis. In open terrain, the call has an average duration of 2.5 ms, but it may be up to 4 ms long. At the beginning, its frequency is around 120 kHz, but it then falls fast, subsequently falls slightly slower, and at the end falls faster again. The call reaches its highest amplitude at around 53 kHz.39 It terminates at around 43 to 46 kHz; this characteristic is especially distinctive.40 In different experiments, the time between calls was found to be around 85 and 66 ms, respectively.41 The high-pitched call may be an adaptation to the animal's occurrence in dense vegetation.42
Head and body length is about 4 cm (2 in) and wingspan is around 20 cm (8 in).43 Forearm length is 30.8 to 34.6 mm (1.2 to 1.4 in), tibia length is 13.5 to 15.9 mm (0.5 to 0.6 in), hindfoot length is 5.1 to 5.8 mm (0.2 to 0.2 in), and body mass is 3.5 to 5.5 g (0.1 to 0.2 oz).44
Distribution and habitat
Although Myotis alcathoe was initially known only from Greece and Hungary and was thought to be restricted to southeastern Europe, records since then have greatly expanded its range, and it is now known from Spain and England to Sweden and European Turkey.45 In several European countries, focused searches were conducted to detect its occurrence.46 Its habitat generally consists of moist, deciduous, mature forest near streams, for example in ravines or in alluvial forest (forest near a river).47 In Germany, its preferred habitat consists of mixed deciduous forest.48 In the south of the continent, it usually occurs in mountain ranges, but the factors affecting its distribution in the north are less well known. Its range appears to be similar in shape to those of the greater and lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and R. hipposideros) and Myotis emarginatus.49 It may yet be found in other European countries, such as the Benelux countries, Ireland, and Moldova.50 Although there are abundant records from some areas, such as France and Hungary, the species appears to be rare in most of its range.51
Known records are as follows:

Albania: A single specimen was caught in 2006 in a forest of planes (Platanus orientalis) and poplars (Populus spp.) next to a small stream. M. mystacinus was recorded at the same place.52
Austria: Three specimens of Myotis alcathoe were caught in Burgenland, southeastern Austria, in 2006.53 They were caught near fishponds in a region dominated by oak (Quercus petraea) and hornbeam (Carpinus betulus).54
Azerbaijan: The species was recorded around 2009.55
Bulgaria: The species is known from six localities in the south and west of the country;56 the first record dates from 2003.57 Habitats include river and mountain forests.58
Caucasus: Bats collected in the Russian part of the Caucasus and in Abkhazia (a breakaway part of Georgia) from 2003 to 200959 may represent Myotis alcathoe. They are small and morphometrically distinct from other local Myotis mystacinus-like bats.60 However, the identity of these bats has not been confirmed molecularly.61
Croatia: In 2003, Myotis alcathoe was recorded here on the basis of two specimens.62
Czech Republic: Here, the species was recorded at nine sites clustered in three regions, with the first record dating from 2001,63 in addition to records from roadkilled specimens at three further sites.64 The typical habitat was mature oak-hornbeam forest near water with dead, decaying trees,65 at altitudes ranging from 170 to 390 m (558 to 1280 ft).66 Both M. mystacinus and M. brandtii occur in some of the same places in this country.67 M. alcathoe has a limited, patchy distribution within the country, but reaches a high abundance in suitable habitat.68
France: Myotis alcathoe was informally recognized in France in 2000 as a small Myotis similar to Myotis mystacinus, the &quot;Murin cantalou&quot;; in 2002, it was realized that this bat represents Myotis alcathoe.69 A large number of sites are known, mostly in the north of the country. The species reaches altitudes of up to 2000 m (6562 ft). It is usually found close to water, but it has been found in a variety of habitats, including farmlands, swamps, forests, and wooden grounds. In late summer and autumn, it occurs in caves.70
Germany: The species is known from two different areas in the country. In 2005 and 2006, specimens were caught in an old moist forest near the Rhine in western Baden-W&lt;U+00FC&gt;rttemberg. Two other bats were found in highway tunnels close to this site.71 The species is also known from the Kyffh&lt;U+00E4&gt;user hill range of Thuringia in central Germany, an island of relatively warm habitat with some unusual wildlife. There, bats were caught near a spring in a karst landscape amid oak-dominated deciduous forest.72 The species was also recorded in deciduous forest at a former Soviet military training site in eastern Thuringia.73 Myotis alcathoe has also been recorded in the nearby states of Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony, where it occurs in mixed deciduous forest. Many Saxony-Anhalt records are from near water.74 However, the species was also recorded in the center of the city of Chemnitz in Saxony.75
Greece: The species has been recorded in the Pindus and Rhodopi Mountains of central and northern Greece. Here, Myotis alcathoe is usually found in stands of plane or alder trees next to small streams in ravines. The bat hunts close to the trees, within the stand. It is often found together with the lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and with M. mystacinus .76
Hungary: Myotis alcathoe is not uncommon in the mountain forests of northeastern Hungary. It has been found at brooks and lakes in oak, beech, alder, and hornbeam (Carpinetum) forests at 230 to 670 m (750 to 2200 ft) altitude. Both M. brandtii and M. mystacinus occur together with M. alcathoe there.77
Italy: Myotis alcathoe has been recorded in beech forest in Majella National Park in the region of Abruzzo.78 Additional specimens of Myotis alcathoe have been identified in Italy using molecular methods.79
Latvia: A small Myotis was captured at a cave in Latvia between 2007 and 2010; pending genetic testing, it is suspected to be M. alcathoe.80
Poland: The species was recorded in four caves in southern Poland in 2005 and 2006, at 770 to 1294 m (2526 to 4245 ft) altitude. Most caves were surrounded by beech forest (Fagus sylvatica), and one was surrounded by fir (Abies alba) and dwarf pine (Pinus mugo).81
Romania: A single Myotis alcathoe was captured in 2007 in a nature reserve in the eastern Carpathians; the reserve contains riverine and conifer forest.82 The species was additionally recorded in a forested valley containing a small stream in Alba County.83
Serbia: The species was reported on the basis of three specimens shortly before 2009 , but is probably rare.84
Slovakia: Here, Myotis alcathoe is known from a single site, a cave in old deciduous forest at 525 m (1722 ft) altitude.85
Slovenia: A single specimen was recorded in Slovenia in 2007.86
Spain: In Catalonia, the species is known from six sites,87 ranging from sea level to 1200 m (3900 ft) altitude. It is known in beech and riverine forest and was first recorded in 2006.88 The species is known from three sites in La Rioja, where it was recorded in 2004, and occurs amidst beech and riverine forest at 790 to 1390 m (2590 to 4560 ft) altitude.89 It has also been found at seven localities in Navarre, with the first record dating from 2004. There, it occurs in beech and oak forest at altitudes from 140 to 980 m (460 to 3220 ft).90 A single locality is known in Galicia.91
Sweden: The species was recorded at five sites in the south of the country, starting in 2008, on the basis of echolocation calls.92
Switzerland: Myotis alcathoe has been recorded from the Col du Marchairuz in the Jura Mountains (canton of Vaud).93
Turkey: Eight individuals have been caught at three sites in close vicinity in the European part of the country94 in 2006.95
United Kingdom: Myotis alcathoe has been recorded in England since 2003, and is known from two swarming sites in the south and a third site in the north of the country.96 The northern England site, in Ryedale, is in a protected area with many old trees, and the southern sites (in Sussex) are in woodland.97


The species is also known from Montenegro and possibly from Bosnia and Herzegovina.98 Early records of Myotis ikonnikovi&lt;U+2014&gt;now known to be an eastern Asian species&lt;U+2014&gt;from Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Romania may also pertain to this species.99 Because whiskered bats in many cases cannot easily be distinguished from each other without the use of genetic methods, some listings do not differentiate between them; records of Myotis alcathoe and/or M. mystacinus and/or (in some cases) M. brandtii have been reported from Bulgaria,100 Belgium,101 Ukraine,102 and Montenegro.103
Ecology and behavior
Myotis alcathoe is a rare species with narrow ecological requirements.104 According to a study in the Czech Republic, the diet of Myotis alcathoe mostly consists of nematoceran flies, but caddisflies, spiders, small lepidopterans, and neuropterans are also taken.105 The presence of spiders in the diet suggests that the species gleans prey from foliage. It forages mainly high in the canopy and over water,106 and is often found in dense vegetation.107 The parasitic mite Spinturnix mystacina has been found on M. alcathoe, and the mites on M. alcathoe, M. brandtii, and M. mystacinus are genetically closely related.108 The bat fly Basilia mongolensis nudior has been recorded on M. alcathoe in Thuringia.109 When caught, individuals of Myotis alcathoe are much calmer than M. mystacinus or M. brandtii.110
Myotis alcathoe lives in small groups.111 In Greece, a maternity colony, containing three females and two juveniles, has been found in a plane tree.112 Additional roosts were found high in oak trees in Baden-W&lt;U+00FC&gt;rttemberg113 and Saxony-Anhalt.114 Twenty-seven roosting sites have been found in the Czech Republic, all but one in trees (the last was in a concrete pole). Most of the tree roosts were in oaks (Quercus robur); others were in limes (Tilia cordata), birches (Betula pendula), and various other species.115 Roosts tend to be located high in the canopy,116 and are often in old trees.117 In summer, roosts may contain large groups of up to 80 individuals, but autumn roosts in the Czech Republic are occupied by smaller groups.118
In Saxony-Anhalt, the species forages deep in valleys when temperatures are above 10 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (50 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F), but on warmer slopes or rocky areas when it is colder.119 There, Myotis alcathoe is relatively easy to capture in August, because M. brandtii and M. mystacinus already start swarming in late July.120 Although there are some records of Myotis alcathoe in caves during the winter, it is also possible that animals spend the winter in tree cavities, and whether swarming behavior occurs in Myotis alcathoe is unclear.121 An animal found in a cave in Saxony-Anhalt in January was not sleeping deeply.122 Reproduction may also take place in caves, but pregnant females have been found as late as June.123 Relatively many juveniles are caught between July and September.124 In England, one individual of M. alcathoe was captured in 2003 (and identified at the time as M. brandtii) and again in 2009.125 Three individuals that were telemetrically tracked (in eastern France, Thuringia, and Baden-W&lt;U+00FC&gt;rttemberg, respectively) moved only 800 m (2600 ft), 935 m (3070 ft), and 1440 m (4720 ft) from their night quarters; M. brandtii and M. mystacinus tend to move over longer distances.126
Conservation status
Because Myotis alcathoe remains poorly known, it is assessed as &quot;Data Deficient&quot; on the IUCN Red List.127 However, it may be endangered because of its narrow ecological preferences.128 Reservoir construction may threaten the species' habitat in some places; two Greek sites where it has been recorded have already been destroyed.129 Forest loss is another possible threat,130 and the species may be restricted to undisturbed habitats.131 Because of its patchy distribution and likely small population, it probably does not easily colonize new habitats.132 The species is protected by national and international measures, but the IUCN Red List recommends further research on various aspects of the species as well as efforts to increase public awareness of the animal.133 In addition, old forests need to be conserved and the species' cave roosts need to be protected.134
In Catalonia, the species is listed as &quot;Endangered&quot; in view of its apparent rarity there.135 The Red List of Germany's Endangered Vertebrates lists Myotis alcathoe as &quot;Critically Endangered&quot; as of 2009.136 In Hungary, where the species is probably not uncommon in suitable habitat,137 it has been protected since 2005.138 However, the species is declining there and is threatened by habitat loss and disturbance of caves.139
