Plot
Season 1

Bo is a succubus who grew up in an adoptive human family, unaware of her non-human nature and of the Fae world. Her succubus powers only become apparent to her when she accidentally kills her first love by draining him of his life energy, an act which forces her to flee her home. Bo exchanges her previously normal life for one without family or friends, moving from place to place whenever she kills again.
In the pilot episode, Bo saves a human girl named Kenzi; the two quickly become friends and Kenzi decides they should team up to create a Fae/Human detective agency. Confronted by the Fae elders with having to choose a side (&quot;Light&quot; or &quot;Dark&quot;), Bo declares herself neutral, deciding to side with humans after Kenzi risked her life to find what had happened to Bo for her own sake where most of the Fae simply saw her as another factor on the board. Throughout the season, Bo learns more about the Fae world and herself while she searches for information about her origins. Along the way, Bo also develops romantic relationships with both Dyson, a wolf shifter police detective and Lauren, a human doctor.
Season 2

With the world of Fae in chaos following Bo's explosive reunion with her mother, Bo must learn to &quot;play the game&quot; and navigate the inner workings of the Fae World in order to protect those who have helped to protect her.8 Bo finds her resolve to stay free challenged, and is forced to question her own morals and beliefs. While Bo grows stronger and learns more about who she really is, relationships will be tested and passions will ignite, but answers will not come easily.9

On April 7, 2010, Prodigy reported that the green-light had been given for a series to be produced to consist of thirteen one-hour episodes.13 Production on the series began in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in the spring of 2010, at sites across southern Ontario and at a small studio in western Toronto.14 Completion of the series' primary production occurred June 25, and the series was aimed for a September 2010 release date.
On June 22, 2010 Keyframe Digital of Niagara-On-The-Lake, Ontario reported that they had been given the contract for visual effects on the first thirteen episodes of Lost Girl, referring to it as fantasy/noir.15
As part of the promotion of the series, an official site was opened at the beginning of August 2010 at lostgirlseries.com. It contained a short trailer for the series, and a summary of information on the series and the characters. On August 20, an interactive comic book was also released that would serve as a lead-in to the series and characters for viewers. It also was expected to have a forum for viewers to interact with the cast and crew before the series actually aired on Showcase. On the same date, a press release indicated that the series cast and crew would be making an appearance at Fan Expo Canada held in Toronto from August 27-29, where they would be answering questions about the series and have promotional items available for watchers of the series as well.16
Episode 8 of the series, called &quot;Vexed&quot;, was the first episode produced and served as the series pilot which was shown to Showcase to obtain the green light for the series.17

Reception
Viewership of the pilot was over 400,000 for the first airing, and &quot;another 184,000&quot; for the second airing, making it the &quot;highest-rated Canadian scripted series premiere of all time on Showcase.&quot;29
In Canada, Rob Salem of the Toronto Star described the show as one that &quot;definitely bears watching.&quot;30 Vladislav Tinchev, writer for the German site Serienjunkies wrote that the series would benefit from &quot;revealing more background information about the represented world,&quot; rather than spend time on &quot;clumsy action scenes.&quot; But Tinchev pointed out that &quot;Lost Girl is not lost at all, and has immediately won the audience and entertains them well. And there is nothing wrong with that, because TV series need not be world-shaking events.&quot;31
Upon its U.S. premiere, The New York Times said &quot;Like other fantasy-tinged shows on Syfy and USA, it offers the minor pleasures of formulaic fantasy and weekly puzzle solving, though in a cheaper-looking and less original package than usual&quot;; &quot;Lost Girl could be more than routine if we felt Bo&lt;U+2019&gt;s magnetism the way her hapless victims do, but through the first few episodes Ms. Silk is more stolid than steamy.&quot;32 In his review for Variety, Brian Lowry wrote: &quot;At first glance, Lost Girl looks like another one of those Canadian imports picked up mostly for financial reasons. The pilot, however, proves unexpectedly fun—a sort of diluted version of True Blood... but the show has wit, style and an enticing lead in the leather-clad Anna Silk.&quot;33
