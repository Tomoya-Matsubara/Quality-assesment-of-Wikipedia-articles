Career
Mount had been active in community work5 and ran for mayor of Lake Charles in 1993, winning against Paul Savoie, a Democrat and former mayor. During her tenure she served as president of the Louisiana Conference of Mayors6 and supported restoration efforts following hurricanes. To this end Mount testified before Congress in support of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999.7 In an effort to succeed retiring state senator James J. Cox, Mount announced her senate candidacy on October 19, 1999, while addressing the Calcasieu Parish School Board, which she asked to support her.8 Upon being elected, Mount resigned as mayor and City Council President Rodney Geyen took over the office.9
In the senate, Mount served on a variety of committees, chairing the Senate Committees on Coastal Restoration and Flood Control,10 Revenue and Fiscal Affairs,11 and Health and Welfare,12 and also serving as Vice-Chair of the Senate Committee on Education.13 Mount often sponsors legislation regarding health and public service. This includes bills intended to identify sex offenders14 and enact term limits for various boards and commissions.15 She was also responsible for passing these term limits as an amendment to the Louisiana Constitution,16 as SB 232 on November 4, 2008.17 Mount also sponsored legislation to merge New Orleans criminal and civil district courts,18 create a childhood and family learning center,19 couple the opening of new hospice care providers with inspections of existing ones,20 allow police to suspend driver's licenses of teenagers with problems at school,21 and create a state-run internet database providing information on the quality of health care providers.22 In her capacity as chair of the Senate Health committee Mount in 2008 declared major Louisiana health care reform unlikely without prior federal reform.23  As senator, Mount raised funds for health care facilities (Mount had herself roasted in support of the Southwest Louisiana Center for Health Services24). Mount is also member of a number of charitable organisations25 and provides an annual compilation of &quot;Louisiana positives&quot; about Louisiana's standing in national ratings.26 Due to term limits, Mount is eligible to serve as senator until 2012.27
2004 Congressional race

Mount ran for Congress in 2004 to succeed Chris John, who had announced his retirement from the U.S. House of Representatives to run for the U.S. Senate. She positioned herself as a conservative Democrat, supportive of balanced budgets and traditional social views,28 emphasizing job creation, health care and her opposition to offshoring.29 Her major Democratic opponent in the jungle primary was African American Don Cravins, father of Don Cravins, Jr. Her major Republican opponent was Charles Boustany, a retired heart surgeon, who ran on a platform of preventing tax increases and passing a new energy bill.30 The Louisiana Democratic Party was supporting Mount, as Cravins was believed to be a weaker contestant in a run-off.31 Polls taken in late October had shown Boustany, Cravins and Mount statistically tied32 and the election was hotly contested.33
In the first ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount garnered the most votes; Cravins was defeated by less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a second ballot was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favouring tax cuts for the rich and being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents.34 Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases.35 Mount also criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of social security, an unpopular position in Louisiana,36 and as removed from the interests of voters.37 She received endorsements by U.S. Senator John Breaux, who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles.38 Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss.39 Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the Voting Rights Act.40
In the run-off on December 4, 2004, Boustany won over Mount by 55 percent to 45 percent in an election with low general voter turnout.41 Democrats had hoped on a big turnout, as the district is nearly a quarter African American, a reliable Democratic constituency. Analysis of the race suggested that Mount's defeat was helped by the open primary system that had the Democratic candidates work against each other42 and led to Cravin's conflict with state Democratic Party which in turn led to suppressed voter turnout.43 The large number of negative advertisements was also cited as a factor that contributed to low turnout.44 Another detriment for Mount mentioned was the strong support for George W. Bush in the presidential election in the district, which he carried by about 60 percent.45 Following her defeat, Mount ruled out another campaign for the seat, but not a campaign for another state-wide office.46
