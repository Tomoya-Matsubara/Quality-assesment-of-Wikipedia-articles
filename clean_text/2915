Before taking the role, Capaldi stated that he had to seriously consider the increased level of visibility that would come with the part.22 He revealed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that he had been invited to audition for the role of the Eighth Doctor in 1995 prior to the production of the 1996 TV film but didn't go, stating: &quot;I didn't go. I loved the show so much, and I didn't think I would get it, and I didn't want to just be part of a big cull of actors.&quot;23
