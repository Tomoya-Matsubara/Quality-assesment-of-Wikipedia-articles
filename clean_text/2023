Ronald Wilson Reagan (February 6, 1911 &lt;U+2013&gt; June 5, 2004) was the 40th President of the United States (1981&lt;U+2013&gt;1989) and the 33rd Governor of California (1967&lt;U+2013&gt;1975).1
Born in Tampico, Illinois, Reagan moved to Los Angeles, California in 1937. He began a career as an actor, first in films and later television, appearing in over fifty movie productions and gaining enough success to become a famous man. Some of his most notable roles are in Knute Rockne, All American and Kings Row. Reagan served as president of the Screen Actors Guild, and later spokesman for General Electric (GE); his start in politics occurred during his work for GE. Originally a member of the Democratic Party, he switched to the Republican Party in 1962. After delivering a rousing speech in support of Barry Goldwater's presidential candidacy in 1964, he was persuaded to seek the California governorship, winning two years later and again in 1970. He was defeated in his run for the Republican presidential nomination in 1968 as well as 1976, but won both the nomination and election in 1980.
As president, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His supply-side economic policies, dubbed &quot;Reaganomics&quot;, advocated controlling the money supply to reduce inflation, and spurring economic growth by reducing tax rates, government regulation of the economy, and certain types of government spending. In his first term he survived an assassination attempt, took a hard line against labor unions, and ordered military actions in Grenada. He was reelected in a landslide in 1984, proclaiming it was &quot;Morning in America&quot;. His second term was primarily marked by foreign matters, such as the ending of the Cold War, the bombing of Libya, and the revelation of the Iran-Contra affair. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an &quot;evil empire&quot;,2 he supported anti-Communist movements worldwide and spent his first term forgoing the strategy of d&lt;U+00E9&gt;tente by ordering a massive military buildup in an arms race with the USSR. Reagan negotiated with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, culminating in the INF Treaty and the decrease of both countries' nuclear arsenals.
Reagan left office in 1989. In 1994, the former president disclosed that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease earlier in the year; he died ten years later at the age of 93. He ranks highly in public opinion polls of U.S. Presidents.

Early life
 Ronald Wilson Reagan was born in an apartment on the second floor of a commercial building in Tampico, Illinois, on February 6, 1911, to John Edward &quot;Jack&quot; Reagan and Nelle Wilson Reagan.3 Reagan's father was of Irish Catholic ancestry,45 while his mother had Scots-English ancestors.6 Reagan had one older brother, Neil &quot;Moon&quot; Reagan (1908&lt;U+2013&gt;1996), who became an advertising executive.7 As a boy, Reagan's father nicknamed his son &quot;Dutch&quot;, due to his &quot;fat little Dutchman&quot;-like appearance, and his &quot;Dutchboy&quot; haircut;8 the nickname stuck with him throughout his youth.9 Reagan's family briefly lived in several towns and cities in Illinois, including Monmouth, Galesburg and Chicago, until 1919, when they returned to Tampico and lived above the H.C. Pitney Variety Store.10 After his election as president, residing in the upstairs White House private quarters, Reagan would quip that he was &quot;living above the store again&quot;.11
According to Paul Kengor, author of God and Ronald Reagan, Reagan had a particularly strong faith in the goodness of people, which stemmed from the optimistic faith of his mother, Nelle,12 and the Disciples of Christ faith,13 which he was baptized into in 1922.14 For the time, Reagan was unusual in his opposition to racial discrimination, and recalled a time in Dixon when the local inn would not allow black people to stay there. Reagan brought them back to his house, where his mother invited them to stay the night and have breakfast the next morning.15
Following the closure of the Pitney Store in late 1920, the Reagans moved to Dixon;16 the midwestern &quot;small universe&quot; had a lasting impression on Reagan.17 He attended Dixon High School,18 where he developed interests in acting, sports, and storytelling.19 His first job was as a lifeguard at the Rock River in Lowell Park, near Dixon, in 1926. Reagan performed 77 rescues as a lifeguard, noting that he notched a mark on a wooden log for every life he saved.20 Reagan attended Eureka College, where he was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, and majored in economics and sociology. He developed a reputation as a jack of all trades, excelling in campus politics, sports and theater. He was a member of the football team, captain of the swim team and was elected student body president. As student president, Reagan notably led a student revolt against the college president after he tried to cut back the faculty.21
Military service
After completing fourteen home-study Army Extension Courses, Reagan enlisted in the Army Enlisted Reserve22 on April 29, 1937, as a private assigned to Troop B, 322nd Cavalry at Des Moines, Iowa.23 He was appointed Second Lieutenant in the Officers Reserve Corps of the Cavalry on May 25, 1937,24 and on June 1825 was assigned to the 323rd Cavalry.26
Reagan was ordered to active duty for the first time on April 18, 1942. Due to his nearsightedness, he was classified for limited service only, which excluded him from serving overseas.27 His first assignment was at the San Francisco Port of Embarkation at Fort Mason, California, as a liaison officer of the Port and Transportation Office.28 Upon the approval of the Army Air Force (AAF), he applied for a transfer from the Cavalry to the AAF on May 15, 1942, and was assigned to AAF Public Relations and subsequently to the 1st Motion Picture Unit (officially, the &quot;18th AAF Base Unit&quot;) in Culver City, California.29 On January 14, 1943 he was promoted to First Lieutenant and was sent to the Provisional Task Force Show Unit of This Is The Army at Burbank, California.30 He returned to the 1st Motion Picture Unit after completing this duty and was promoted to Captain on July 22, 1943.31
In January 1944, Captain Reagan was ordered to temporary duty in New York City to participate in the opening of the sixth War Loan Drive. He was re-assigned to the 18th AAF Base Unit on November 14, 1944, where he remained until the end of World War II.32 He was recommended for promotion to Major on February 2, 1945, but this recommendation was disapproved on July 17 of that year.33 He returned to Fort MacArthur, California, where he was separated from active duty on December 9, 1945.34 By the end of the war, his units had produced some 400 training films for the AAF.35
Entertainment career

Radio and film
 After graduating from Eureka in 1932, Reagan drove himself to Iowa, where he auditioned for a job at many small-town radio stations.36 The University of Iowa hired him to broadcast home football games for the Hawkeyes. He was paid $10 per game.37 Soon after, a staff announcer's job opened at radio station WOC in Davenport, and Reagan was hired, now earning $100 per month.38 Aided by his persuasive voice,39 he moved to WHO radio in Des Moines as an announcer for Chicago Cubs baseball games.40 His specialty was creating play-by-play accounts of games that the station received by wire.41
While traveling with the Cubs in California, Reagan took a screen test in 1937 that led to a seven-year contract with Warner Brothers studios.42 He spent the first few years of his Hollywood career in the &quot;B film&quot; unit, where, Reagan joked, the producers &quot;didn't want them good, they wanted them Thursday&quot;.43 While sometimes overshadowed by other actors, Reagan's screen performances did receive many good reviews.44
 His first screen credit was the starring role in the 1937 movie Love Is on the Air, and by the end of 1939 he had already appeared in 19 films,45 including Dark Victory. Before the film Santa Fe Trail in 1940, he played the role of George &quot;The Gipper&quot; Gipp in the film Knute Rockne, All American; from it, he acquired the lifelong nickname &quot;the Gipper&quot;.46 Reagan's favorite acting role was as a double amputee in 1942's Kings Row,47 in which he recites the line, &quot;Where's the rest of me?&quot;, later used as the title of his 1965 autobiography. Many film critics considered Kings Row to be his best movie,48 though the film was condemned by New York Times critic Bosley Crowther.4950
Reagan called Kings Row the film that &quot;made me a star&quot;.51 However, he was unable to capitalize on his success because he was ordered to active duty with the U.S. Army at San Francisco two months after its release, and never regained &quot;star&quot; status in motion pictures.52 In the post-war era, after being separated from almost four years of World War II stateside service with the 1st Motion Picture Unit in December 1945, Reagan co-starred in such films as, The Voice of the Turtle , John Loves Mary, The Hasty Heart, Bedtime for Bonzo, Cattle Queen of Montana, Tennessee's Partner, Hellcats of the Navy and The Killers (his final film) in a 1964 remake.53
Fan Mail
While he worked at Warner Bros., according to Reagan: A Life in Letters, (pages 836&lt;U+2013&gt;837), Reagan enlisted his mother Nelle Wilson Reagan to answer his fan mail. She would handwrite letters and sign his name as if he had written the letters. Mrs. Reagan would sign her actor-son's name on photographs and even on membership cards in the Ronald Reagan Fan Club.54 The article &quot;Devoted Mother, Devoted Son&quot; in the January/February 1985 issue of The Pen &amp; Quill, journal of the Universal Autograph Collectors Club, compares the handwriting of mother and son, pointing out the differences, and also reveals that Reagan was paying his mother $75.00 a week.55 According to the UACC, a lawsuit is forthcoming against autograph collector Steve Koschal because his 2008 self-published book Ronald Reagan and Nelle Reagan- Autograph Mystery Uncovered is &quot;completely plagiarized&quot; from the 1985 issue of the club's journal.56
SAG president and television
 Reagan was first elected to the Board of Directors of the Screen Actors Guild in 1941, serving as an alternate. Following World War II, he resumed service and became 3rd Vice president in 1946.57 The adoption of conflict-of-interest bylaws in 1947 led the SAG president and six board members to resign; Reagan was nominated in a special election for the position of president and subsequently elected.58 He would subsequently be chosen by the membership to seven additional one-year terms, from 1947 to 1952 and in 1959.59 Reagan led SAG through eventful years that were marked by labor-management disputes, the Taft-Hartley Act, House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) hearings and the Hollywood blacklist era.60
Amid the Red Scare in the late 1940s, Reagan provided the FBI with names of actors whom he believed to be communist sympathizers within the motion picture industry.61 Reagan testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee on the subject as well.62 A fervent anti-communist, he reaffirmed his commitment to democratic principles, stating, &quot;I never as a citizen want to see our country become urged, by either fear or resentment of this group, that we ever compromise with any of our democratic principles through that fear or resentment.&quot;63
Though an early critic of television, Reagan landed fewer film roles in the late 1950s and decided to join the medium.64 He was hired as the host of General Electric Theater, a series of weekly dramas that became very popular.65 His contract required him to tour GE plants ten weeks out of the year, often demanding of him fourteen speeches per day.66 He earned approximately $125,000 per year (about $1.07 million in 2010 dollars) in this role. His final work as a professional actor was as host and performer from 1964 to 1965 on the television series Death Valley Days.67 Reagan and Nancy Davis appeared together several times, including an episode of GE Theater in 1958 called A Turkey for President.68
Marriages and children
In 1938, Reagan co-starred in the film Brother Rat with actress Jane Wyman (1917&lt;U+2013&gt;2007). They were engaged at the Chicago Theatre,69 and married on January 26, 1940, at the Wee Kirk o' the Heather church in Glendale, California.70 Together they had two children, Maureen (1941&lt;U+2013&gt;2001) and Christine (born June 26, 1947; died June 27, 1947), and adopted a third, Michael (born 1945).71 Following arguments about Reagan's political ambitions, Wyman filed for divorce in 1948,72 citing a distraction due to her husband's Screen Actors Guild union duties; the divorce was finalized in 1949.73 (He is the only U.S. president to have been divorced.)74
 Reagan met actress Nancy Davis (born 1921)75 in 1949 after she contacted him in his capacity as president of the Screen Actors Guild to help her with issues regarding her name appearing on a communist blacklist in Hollywood (she had been mistaken for another Nancy Davis). She described their meeting by saying, &quot;I don't know if it was exactly love at first sight, but it was pretty close.&quot;76 They were engaged at Chasen's restaurant in Los Angeles and were married on March 4, 1952, at the Little Brown Church in the San Fernando Valley.77 Actor William Holden served as best man at the ceremony. They had two children: Patti (born 1952) and Ron (born 1958).
Observers described the Reagans' relationship as close, real, and intimate.78 During his presidency they were reported as frequently displaying their affection for one another; one press secretary said, &quot;They never took each other for granted. They never stopped courting.&quot;7980 He often called her &quot;Mommy;&quot; she called him &quot;Ronnie&quot;.81 He once wrote to her, &quot;whatever I treasure and enjoy ... all would be without meaning if I didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t have you.&quot;82 When he was in the hospital in 1981, she slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by his scent.83 In a letter to U.S. citizens written in 1994, Reagan wrote &quot;I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease.... I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience&quot;,84 and in 1998, while Reagan was stricken by Alzheimer's, Nancy told Vanity Fair, &quot;Our relationship is very special. We were very much in love and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did. I can't imagine life without him.&quot;85
Early political career

Cover of Reagan's spoken-word album Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine, 1961

Reagan began his political career as a liberal Democrat, admirer of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and active supporter of New Deal policies, but in the early 1950s he shifted to the right and endorsed the presidential candidacies of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 as well as Richard Nixon in 1960 while remaining a Democrat.86 His many GE speeches&lt;U+2014&gt;which he wrote himself&lt;U+2014&gt;were non-partisan but carried a conservative, pro-business message; he was influenced by Lemuel Boulware, a senior GE executive. Boulware, known for his tough stance against unions and his innovative strategies to win over workers, championed the core tenets of modern American conservatism: free markets, anticommunism, lower taxes, and limited government.87 Eventually, the ratings for Reagan's show fell off and GE dropped Reagan in 1962.88 Reagan formally switched to the Republican Party in 1962, stating, &quot;I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me.&quot;89
Reagan opposed certain civil rights legislation, saying &quot;If an individual wants to discriminate against Negroes or others in selling or renting his house, it is his right to do so&quot;.90 He later reversed his opposition to voting rights and fair housing laws. He strongly denied having racist motives.91 When legislation that would become Medicare was introduced in 1961, Reagan created a recording for the American Medical Association warning that such legislation would mean the end of freedom in America. Reagan said that if his listeners did not write letters to prevent it, &quot;we will awake to find that we have so&lt;U+00AD&gt;cialism. And if you don't do this, and if I don't do it, one of these days, you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children, and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free.&quot;929394
Reagan endorsed the campaign of conservative presidential contender Barry Goldwater in 1964. Speaking for Goldwater, Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government. He revealed his ideological motivation in a famed speech delivered on October 27, 1964: &quot;The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing.&quot;95 This &quot;Time for Choosing&quot; speech raised $1 million for Goldwater's campaign96 and is considered the event that launched Reagan's political career.97
Governor of California, 1967&lt;U+2013&gt;1975
  California Republicans were impressed with Reagan's political views and charisma after his &quot;Time for Choosing&quot; speech,98 and nominated him for Governor of California in 1966. In Reagan's campaign, he emphasized two main themes: &quot;to send the welfare bums back to work,&quot; and in reference to burgeoning anti-war and anti-establishment student protests at the University of California at Berkeley, &quot;to clean up the mess at Berkeley.&quot;99 He was elected, defeating two-term governor Edmund G. &quot;Pat&quot; Brown, and was sworn in on January 3, 1967. In his first term, he froze government hiring and approved tax hikes to balance the budget.100
Shortly after the beginning of his term, Reagan tested the presidential waters in 1968 as part of a &quot;Stop Nixon&quot; movement, hoping to cut into Nixon's Southern support101 and be a compromise candidate102 if neither Nixon nor second-place Nelson Rockefeller received enough delegates to win on the first ballot at the Republican convention. However, by the time of the convention Nixon had 692 delegate votes, 25 more than he needed to secure the nomination, followed by Rockefeller with Reagan in third place.103
 Reagan was involved in high-profile conflicts with the protest movements of the era. On May 15, 1969, during the People's Park protests at UC Berkeley, Reagan sent the California Highway Patrol and other officers to quell the protests, in an incident that became known as &quot;Bloody Thursday.&quot;104105 Reagan then called out 2,200 state National Guard troops to occupy the city of Berkeley for two weeks in order to crack down on the protesters.106 When the Symbionese Liberation Army kidnapped Patty Hearst in Berkeley and demanded the distribution of food to the poor, Reagan joked, &quot;It's just too bad we can't have an epidemic of botulism.&quot;107
Early in 1967, the national debate on abortion was beginning. Democratic California state senator Anthony Beilenson introduced the &quot;Therapeutic Abortion Act,&quot; in an effort to reduce the number of &quot;back-room abortions&quot; performed in California.108 The State Legislature sent the bill to Reagan's desk where, after many days of indecision, he signed it.109 About two million abortions would be performed as a result, most because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the well-being of the mother.110 Reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill, and stated that had he been more experienced as governor, it would not have been signed. After he recognized what he called the &quot;consequences&quot; of the bill, he announced that he was pro-life.111 He maintained that position later in his political career, writing extensively about abortion.112
Despite an unsuccessful attempt to recall him in 1968,113 Reagan was re-elected in 1970, defeating &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Jesse Unruh. He chose not to seek a third term in the following election cycle. One of Reagan's greatest frustrations in office concerned capital punishment, which he strongly supported.114 His efforts to enforce the state's laws in this area were thwarted when the Supreme Court of California issued its People v. Anderson decision, which invalidated all death sentences issued in California prior to 1972, though the decision was later overturned by a constitutional amendment. The only execution during Reagan's governorship was on April 12, 1967, when Aaron Mitchell's sentence was carried out by the state in San Quentin's gas chamber.115
Reagan's terms as governor helped to shape the policies he would pursue in his later political career as president. By campaigning on a platform of sending &quot;the welfare bums back to work,&quot; he spoke out against the idea of the welfare state. He also strongly advocated the Republican ideal of less government regulation of the economy, including that of undue federal taxation.116
1976 presidential campaign

 In 1976, Reagan challenged incumbent President Gerald Ford in a bid to become the Republican Party's candidate for president. Reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support of like-minded organizations such as the American Conservative Union which became key components of his political base, while President Ford was considered a more moderate Republican.117
Reagan's campaign relied on a strategy crafted by campaign manager John Sears of winning a few primaries early to seriously damage the lift-off of Ford's campaign. Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy disintegrated118 and he ended up losing New Hampshire and Florida.119 As the party's convention neared, Ford appeared close to victory. Acknowledging his party's moderate wing, Reagan chose moderate Republican Senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania as his running mate. Nonetheless, Ford narrowly won with 1,187 delegates to Reagan's 1,070.120
Reagan's concession speech emphasized the dangers of nuclear war and the threat posed by the Soviet Union. Though he lost the nomination, he received 307 write-in votes in New Hampshire, 388 votes as an Independent on Wyoming's ballot, and a single electoral vote from a faithless elector in the November election from the state of Washington,121 which Ford had won over Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter. During this time he was granted an honary membership into Alpha Kappa Psi, Alpha Zeta Chapter.122
1980 presidential campaign

 The 1980 presidential campaign between Reagan and incumbent President Jimmy Carter was conducted during domestic concerns and the ongoing Iran hostage crisis. His campaign stressed some of his fundamental principles: lower taxes to stimulate the economy,123 less government interference in people's lives,124 states' rights,125 and a strong national defense.126
After receiving the Republican nomination, Reagan selected one of his primary opponents, George H.W. Bush, to be his running mate. His showing in the October televised debate boosted his campaign. Reagan won the election, carrying 44 states with 489 electoral votes to 49 electoral votes for Carter (representing six states and Washington, D.C.). Reagan received 50.7% of the popular vote while Carter took 41%, and Independent John B. Anderson (a liberal Republican) received 6.7%.127 Republicans captured the Senate for the first time since 1952, and gained 34 House seats, but the Democrats retained a majority.
Presidency, 1981&lt;U+2013&gt;1989

During his Presidency, Ronald Reagan pursued policies that reflected his personal belief in individual freedom, brought changes domestically, both to the U.S. economy and expanded military, and contributed to the end of the Cold War.128 Termed the Reagan Revolution, his presidency would reinvigorate American morale129130 and reduce the people's reliance upon government.131 As president, Reagan kept a series of diaries in which he commented on daily occurrences of his presidency and his views on the issues of the day. The diaries were published in May 2007 in the bestselling book, The Reagan Diaries.132
First term, 1981&lt;U+2013&gt;1985
 To date, Reagan is the oldest man elected to the office of the presidency (at 69).133 In his first inaugural address on January 20, 1981, which Reagan himself wrote,134 he addressed the country's economic malaise arguing: &quot;In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problems; government is the problem.&quot;
The Reagan Presidency began in a dramatic manner; as Reagan was giving his inaugural address, 52 U.S. hostages, held by Iran for 444 days were set free.135
Assassination attempt

On March 30, 1981, Reagan, along with his press secretary James Brady and two others, were shot by a would-be assassin, John Hinckley, Jr., outside of the Hilton Washington hotel. Missing Reagan's heart by less than one inch,136 the bullet instead pierced his left lung.137 He began coughing up blood in the limousine and was rushed to George Washington University Hospital, where it was determined that his lung had collapsed;138 he underwent emergency surgery to remove the bullet.139 In the operating room, Reagan joked to the surgeons, &quot;I hope you're all Republicans!&quot;140 Though they were not, Joseph Giordano (a Democrat) replied, &quot;Today, Mr. President, we're all Republicans.&quot;
The bullet was removed and the surgery was deemed a success.141 It was later determined, however, that the president's life had been in serious danger due to rapid blood loss and severe breathing difficulties.142 He was able to turn the grave situation into a more light-hearted one, though, for when Nancy Reagan came to see him he told her, &quot;Honey, I forgot to duck&quot; (using Jack Dempsey's quip).143
The president was released from the hospital on April 11 and recovered relatively quickly,144 becoming the first serving U.S. President to survive being shot in an assassination attempt.145 The attempt had great influence on Reagan's popularity; polls indicated his approval rating to be around 73%.146 Reagan believed that God had spared his life so that he might go on to fulfill a greater purpose.147
Air traffic controllers' strike

Only a short time into his administration, federal air traffic controllers went on strike, violating a regulation prohibiting government unions from striking.148 Declaring the situation an emergency as described in the 1947 Taft Hartley Act, Reagan held a press conference in the White House Rose Garden, where he stated that if the air traffic controllers &quot;do not report for work within 48 hours, they have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated.&quot;149 Despite fear from some members of his cabinet over a potential political backlash,150 on August 5, Reagan fired 11,345 striking air traffic controllers who had ignored his order to return to work,151 busting the union.152 According to Charles Craver, a labor law professor at George Washington University Law School, the move gave Americans a new view of Reagan, who &quot;sent a message to the private employer community that it would be all right to go up against the unions&quot;.153 This position was in stark contrast to Ronald Reagan's past as a labor union president of the Screen Actor's Guild, as well as his support for the Polish labor union Solidarity in its fight against Soviet domination.
&quot;Reaganomics&quot; and the economy



Ronald Reagan's official White House portrait

During Jimmy Carter's last year in office (1980), inflation averaged 12.5%, compared to 4.4% during Reagan's last year in office (1988).154 Over those eight years, the unemployment rate declined from 7.5% to 5.3%, hitting highs of 9.7% (1982) and 9.6% (1983) and averaging 7.5% during Reagan's administration.155
Reagan implemented policies based on supply-side economics and advocated a classical liberal and laissez-faire philosophy,156 seeking to stimulate the economy with large, across-the-board tax cuts.157158 Citing the economic theories of Arthur Laffer, Reagan promoted the proposed tax cuts as potentially stimulating the economy enough to expand the tax base, offsetting the revenue loss due to reduced rates of taxation, a theory that entered political discussion as the Laffer curve. Reaganomics was the subject of debate with supporters pointing to improvements in certain key economic indicators as evidence of success, and critics pointing to large increases in federal budget deficits and the national debt. His policy of &quot;peace through strength&quot; (also described as &quot;firm but fair&quot;) resulted in a record peacetime defense buildup including a 40% real increase in defense spending between 1981 and 1985.159
During Reagan's presidency, federal income tax rates were lowered significantly with the signing of the bipartisan Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981.160 The top tier tax bracket rates were lowered from 70% to 28%. Conversely, Congress raised some taxes in every year from 1981 to 1987 to continue funding such government programs as TEFRA, Social Security, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984.161162 Despite the fact that TEFRA was the &quot;largest peacetime tax increase in American history,&quot; Reagan is better known for his tax cuts and lower-taxes philosophy.163164165166 Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth recovered strongly after the early 1980s recession ended in 1982, and grew during his eight years in office at an annual rate of 3.85% per year.167 Unemployment peaked at 10.8% percent in December 1982&lt;U+2014&gt;higher than any time since the Great Depression&lt;U+2014&gt;then dropped during the rest of Reagan's presidency.168 Sixteen million new jobs were created, while inflation significantly decreased.169 The net effect of all Reagan-era tax bills was a 1% decrease in government revenues when compared to Treasury Department revenue estimates from the Administration's first post-enactment January budgets.170 However, federal Income Tax receipts increased from 1980 to 1989, rising from $308.7Bn to $549.0Bn.171
During the Reagan Administration, federal receipts grew at an average rate of 8.2% (2.5% attributed to higher Social Security receipts), and federal outlays grew at an annual rate of 7.1%.172173 Reagan also revised the tax code with the bipartisan Tax Reform Act of 1986.174
 Reagan's policies proposed that economic growth would occur when marginal tax rates were low enough to spur investment,175 which would then lead to increased economic growth, higher employment and wages. Critics labeled this &quot;trickle-down economics&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;the belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will create a &quot;trickle-down&quot; effect to the poor.176 Questions arose whether Reagan's policies benefitted the wealthy more than those living in poverty,177 and many poor and minority citizens viewed Reagan as indifferent to their struggles.178
Following his less-government intervention views, Reagan cut the budgets of non-military179 programs180 including Medicaid, food stamps, federal education programs181 and the EPA.182 While he protected entitlement programs, such as Social Security and Medicare,183 his administration attempted to purge many people with disabilities from the Social Security disability rolls.184
The administration's stance toward the Savings and Loan industry contributed to the Savings and Loan crisis.185 It is also suggested, by a minority of Reaganomics critics, that the policies partially influenced the stock market crash of 1987,186 but there is no consensus regarding a single source for the crash.187 In order to cover newly spawned federal budget deficits, the United States borrowed heavily both domestically and abroad, raising the national debt from $997 billion to $2.85 trillion.188 Reagan described the new debt as the &quot;greatest disappointment&quot; of his presidency.189
He reappointed Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and in 1987 he appointed monetarist Alan Greenspan to succeed him. Reagan ended the price controls on domestic oil which had contributed to energy crises in the 1970s.190191 The price of oil subsequently dropped, and the 1980s did not see the fuel shortages that the 1970s had.192 Reagan also fulfilled a 1980 campaign promise to repeal the Windfall profit tax in 1988, which had previously increased dependence on foreign oil.193 Some economists, such as Nobel Prize winners Milton Friedman and Robert A. Mundell, argue that Reagan's tax policies invigorated America's economy and contributed to the economic boom of the 1990s.194 Other economists, such as Nobel Prize winner Robert Solow, argue that the deficits were a major reason why Reagan's successor, George H. W. Bush, reneged on a campaign promise and raised taxes.195
Lebanon and Grenada, 1983

 American peacekeeping forces in Beirut, a part of a multinational force during the Lebanese Civil War who had been earlier deployed by Reagan, were attacked on October 23, 1983. The Beirut barracks bombing resulted in the deaths of 241 American servicemen and the wounding of more than 60 others by a suicide truck bomber. Reagan sent a White House team to the site four days later, led by his Vice President, George H.W. Bush. Reagan called the attack &quot;despicable&quot;, pledged to keep a military force in Lebanon, and planned to target the Sheik Abdullah barracks in Baalbek, Lebanon, training ground for Hezbollah fighters,196197 but the mission was later aborted. On February 7, 1984, President Reagan ordered the Marines to begin withdrawal from Lebanon. In April 1984, as his keynote address to the 20,000 attendees of the Rev. Jerry Falwell's &quot;Baptist Fundamentalism '84&quot; convention in Washington, D.C., he read a first hand account of the bombing, written by Navy Chaplain (Rabbi) Arnold Resnicoff, who had been asked to write the report by Bush and his team.
On October 25, 1983, only two days later, Reagan ordered U.S. forces to invade Grenada, where a 1979 coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat had established an independent non-aligned Marxist-Leninist government. A formal appeal from the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) led to the intervention of U.S. forces; President Reagan also cited an allegedly regional threat posed by a Soviet-Cuban military build-up in the Caribbean and concern for the safety of several hundred American medical students at St. George's University as adequate reasons to invade. In the first major operation conducted by the U.S. military since the Vietnam War, several days of fighting commenced, resulting in a U.S. victory,198 with 19 American fatalities and 116 wounded American soldiers.199 In mid-December, after a new government was appointed by the Governor-General, U.S. forces withdrew.200
Escalation of the Cold War

Reagan escalated the Cold War, accelerating a reversal from the policy of d&lt;U+00E9&gt;tente which began in 1979 following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.201 Reagan ordered a massive buildup of the United States Military202 and implemented new policies towards the Soviet Union: reviving the B-1 bomber program that had been canceled by the Carter administration, and producing the MX &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; missile.203 In response to Soviet deployment of the SS-20, Reagan oversaw NATO's deployment of the Pershing II missile in West Germany.204

Reagan, the first American president ever to address the British Parliament, predicts Marxism-Leninism will be left on the &quot;ash-heap of history&quot;.205

Together with the United Kingdom's prime minister Margaret Thatcher, Reagan denounced the Soviet Union in ideological terms.206 In a famous address on June 8, 1982 to the British Parliament in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster, Reagan said, &quot;the forward march of freedom and democracy will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash-heap of history.&quot;207208 On March 3, 1983, he predicted that communism would collapse, stating, &quot;Communism is another sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages even now are being written.&quot;209 In a speech to the National Association of Evangelicals on March 8, 1983, Reagan called the Soviet Union &quot;an evil empire&quot;.210 After Soviet fighters downed Korean Air Lines Flight 007 near Moneron Island on September 1, 1983, carrying 269 people including U.S. congressman from Georgia Larry McDonald, Reagan labeled the act a &quot;massacre&quot; and declared that the Soviets had turned &quot;against the world and the moral precepts which guide human relations among people everywhere&quot;.211 The Reagan administration responded to the incident by suspending all Soviet passenger air service to the United States, and dropped several agreements being negotiated with the Soviets, wounding them financially.212
Under a policy that came to be known as the Reagan Doctrine, Reagan and his administration also provided overt and covert aid to anti-communist resistance movements in an effort to &quot;rollback&quot; Soviet-backed communist governments in Africa, Asia and Latin America.213 Reagan deployed the CIA's Special Activities Division to Afghanistan and Pakistan. They were instrumental in training, equipping and leading Mujaheddin forces against the Soviet Red Army.214215 President Reagan's Covert Action program has been given credit for assisting in ending the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan,216 though the US funded armaments introduced then would later pose a threat to US troops in the 2000s war in Afghanistan.217
In March 1983, Reagan introduced the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a defense project218 that would have used ground and space-based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles.219 Reagan believed that this defense shield could make nuclear war impossible,220221 but disbelief that the technology could ever work led opponents to dub SDI &quot;Star Wars&quot; and argue that the technological objective was unattainable.222 The Soviets became concerned about the possible effects SDI would have;223 leader Yuri Andropov said it would put &quot;the entire world in jeopardy&quot;.224 For those reasons, David Gergen, former aide to President Reagan, believes that in retrospect, SDI hastened the end of the Cold War.225
Critics labeled Reagan's foreign policies as aggressive, imperialistic, and chided them as &quot;warmongering&quot;, though they were supported by leading American conservatives who argued that they were necessary to protect U.S. security interests.226 A reformer, Mikhail Gorbachev, would later rise to power in the Soviet Union in 1985, implementing new policies for openness and reform that were called glasnost and perestroika.
1984 presidential campaign


1984 presidential electoral votes by state. Reagan (red) won every state except for Mondale's home state of Minnesota (and Washington, D.C.)

Reagan accepted the Republican nomination in Dallas, Texas, on a wave of positive feeling. He proclaimed that it was &quot;morning again in America&quot;,227 regarding the recovering economy and the dominating performance by the U.S. athletes at the Los Angeles Olympics that summer, among other things. He became the first American president to open an Olympic Games held in the United States.228
Reagan's opponent in the 1984 presidential election was former Vice President Walter Mondale. With questions about Reagan's age, and a weak performance in the first presidential debate, it was questioned whether he was capable to be president for another term. This confused and forgetful behavior horrified his supporters at that moment, as they always knew him as clever and witty, and it is said that around this time were the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease showing in him.229230 Reagan rebounded in the second debate, and confronted questions about his age, quipping, &quot;I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience&quot;, which generated applause and laughter.231
That November, Reagan was re-elected, winning 49 of 50 states.232 The president's landslide victory saw Mondale carry only his home state of Minnesota (by 3800 votes) and the District of Columbia. Reagan won a record 525 electoral votes, the most of any candidate in United States history,233 and received 58.8% of the popular vote to Mondale's 40.6%.234
Second term, 1985&lt;U+2013&gt;1989
Reagan was sworn in as president for the second time on January 20, 1985, in a private ceremony at the White House. Because January 20 fell on a Sunday, a public celebration was not held but took place in the Capitol Rotunda the following day. January 21 was one of the coldest days on record in Washington, D.C.; due to poor weather, inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol.
 In 1985, Reagan visited a German military cemetery in Bitburg to lay a wreath with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. It was determined that the cemetery held the graves of 49 members of the Waffen-SS. Reagan issued a statement that called the Nazi soldiers buried in that cemetery &quot;victims&quot;, which ignited a stir over whether he had equated the SS men to Holocaust victims; Pat Buchanan, Director of Communications under Reagan, argued that the notion was false.235 Now strongly urged to cancel the visit,236 the president responded that it would be wrong to back down on a promise he had made to Chancellor Kohl. He attended the ceremony where two military generals laid a wreath.237
The disintegration of the Space Shuttle Challenger on January 28, 1986 proved a pivotal moment in Reagan's presidency. All seven astronauts aboard were killed.238 On the night of the disaster, Reagan delivered a speech written by Peggy Noonan in which he said:

War on Drugs
Midway into his second term, Reagan declared more militant policies in the War on Drugs. He said that &quot;drugs were menacing our society&quot; and promised to fight for drug-free schools and workplaces, expanded drug treatment, stronger law enforcement and drug interdiction efforts, and greater public awareness.239240
In 1986, Reagan signed a drug enforcement bill that budgeted $1.7 billion to fund the War on Drugs and specified a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses.241 The bill was criticized for promoting significant racial disparities in the prison population242 and critics also charged that the policies did little to reduce the availability of drugs on the street, while resulting in a great financial burden for America.243 Defenders of the effort point to success in reducing rates of adolescent drug use.244245 First Lady Nancy Reagan made the War on Drugs her main priority by founding the &quot;Just Say No&quot; drug awareness campaign, which aimed to discourage children and teenagers from engaging in recreational drug use by offering various ways of saying &quot;no&quot;. Mrs. Reagan traveled to 65 cities in 33 states, raising awareness about the dangers of drugs and alcohol.246
Libya bombing

Relations between Libya and the U.S. under President Reagan were continually contentious, beginning with the Gulf of Sidra incident in 1981. These tensions were later revived in early April 1986, when a bomb exploded in a Berlin discoth&lt;U+00E8&gt;que, resulting in the injuries of 63 American military personnel and death of one serviceman.247 Citing that there was &quot;irrefutable proof&quot; that Libya had directed the terrorist bombing,248 Reagan authorized the use of force against the country.249 In the late evening of April 15, 1986, the U.S. launched a series of air strikes on ground targets in Libya.250 The attack was designed to halt Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's ability to export terrorism, offering him &quot;incentives and reasons to alter his criminal behavior&quot;.251 The president addressed the nation from the Oval Office after the attacks had commenced, stating, &quot;When our citizens are attacked or abused anywhere in the world on the direct orders of hostile regimes, we will respond so long as I'm in this office.&quot;252
Immigration
Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986. The act made it illegal to knowingly hire or recruit illegal immigrants, required employers to attest to their employees' immigration status, and granted amnesty to approximately 3 million illegal immigrants who entered the United States prior to January 1, 1982, and had lived in the country continuously. Critics argue that the employer sanctions were without teeth and failed to stem illegal immigration.253 Upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished Statue of Liberty, Reagan said, &quot;The legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows, without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society. Very soon many of these men and women will be able to step into the sunlight and, ultimately, if they choose, they may become Americans.&quot;254
Iran-Contra affair

 In 1986, a scandal shook the administration stemming from the use of proceeds from covert arms sales to Iran to fund the Contras in Nicaragua, which had been specifically outlawed by an act of Congress.255256 The Iran-Contra affair became the largest political scandal in the United States during the 1980s.257 The International Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed,258 ruled that the U.S. had violated international law in Nicaragua due to its obligations not to intervene in the affairs of other states.259
President Reagan professed ignorance of the plot's existence. He appointed two Republicans and one Democrat (John Tower, Brent Scowcroft and Edmund Muskie, known as the &quot;Tower Commission&quot;) to investigate the scandal. The commission could not find direct evidence that Reagan had prior knowledge of the program, but criticized him heavily for his disengagement from managing his staff, making the diversion of funds possible.260 A separate report by Congress concluded that &quot;If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing, he should have.&quot;261 Reagan's popularity declined from 67 percent to 46 percent in less than a week, the greatest and quickest decline ever for a president.262 The scandal resulted in fourteen indictments within Reagan's staff, and eleven convictions.263
Many Central Americans criticize Reagan for his support of the Contras, calling him an anti-communist zealot, blinded to human rights abuses, while others say he &quot;saved Central America&quot;.264 Daniel Ortega, Sandinistan and current president of Nicaragua, said that he hoped God would forgive Reagan for his &quot;dirty war against Nicaragua&quot;.265 In 1986 the USA was found guilty by the International Court of Justice (World Court) of war crimes against Nicaragua.266
End of the Cold War

 By the early 1980s, the USSR had built up a military arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Previously, the U.S. had relied on the qualitative superiority of its weapons to essentially frighten the Soviets, but the gap had been narrowed.267 After President Reagan's military buildup, the Soviet Union did not further dramatically build up its military;268 the enormous military expenses, in combination with collectivized agriculture and inefficient planned manufacturing, were a heavy burden for the Soviet economy.269 At the same time, the Reagan Administration persuaded Saudi Arabia to increase oil production,270 which resulted in a drop of oil prices in 1985 to one-third of the previous level; oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues.271 These factors gradually brought the Soviet economy to a stagnant state during Gorbachev's tenure.272
Ronald Reagan recognized the change in the direction of the Soviet leadership with Mikhail Gorbachev, and shifted to diplomacy, with a view to encourage the Soviet leader to pursue substantial arms agreements.273 Reagan's personal mission was to achieve &quot;a world free of nuclear weapons,&quot; which he regarded as &quot;totally irrational, totally inhumane, good for nothing but killing, possibly destructive of life on earth and civilization.&quot;274275276 He was able to start discussions on nuclear disarmament with General Secretary Gorbachev.277 Gorbachev and Reagan held four summit conferences between 1985 and 1988: the first in Geneva, Switzerland, the second in Reykjav&lt;U+00ED&gt;k, Iceland, the third in Washington, D.C., and the fourth in Moscow.278 Reagan believed that if he could persuade the Soviets to allow for more democracy and free speech, this would lead to reform and the end of Communism.279
Speaking at the Berlin Wall on June 12, 1987, Reagan challenged Gorbachev to go further, saying: 
 Prior to Gorbachev visiting Washington, D.C., for the third summit in 1987, the Soviet leader announced his intention to pursue significant arms agreements.280 The timing of the announcement led Western diplomats to contend that Gorbachev was offering major concessions to the U.S. on the levels of conventional forces, nuclear weapons, and policy in Eastern Europe.281 He and Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty at the White House, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons.282 The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START I; Reagan insisted that the name of the treaty be changed from Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.283
When Reagan visited Moscow for the fourth summit in 1988, he was viewed as a celebrity by the Soviets. A journalist asked the president if he still considered the Soviet Union the evil empire. &quot;No&quot;, he replied, &quot;I was talking about another time, another era.&quot;284 At Gorbachev's request, Reagan gave a speech on free markets at the Moscow State University.285 In his autobiography, An American Life, Reagan expressed his optimism about the new direction that they charted and his warm feelings for Gorbachev.286 The Berlin Wall was torn down beginning in 1989 and two years later the Soviet Union collapsed.
Health and well-being
On July 13, 1985, Reagan underwent surgery at Bethesda Naval Hospital to remove cancerous polyps from his colon. This caused the first-ever invocation of the acting president clause of the 25th Amendment.287 The surgery lasted just under three hours and was successful.288 Reagan resumed the powers of the presidency later that day.289 In August of that year, he underwent an operation to remove skin cancer cells from his nose.290 In October, additional skin cancer cells were detected on his nose and removed.291
Two years later, on January 5, Reagan underwent surgery for an enlarged prostate which caused further worries about his health. No cancerous growths were found, however, and he was not sedated during the operation.292 In July of that year, aged 76, he underwent a third skin cancer operation on his nose.293
Earlier in his presidency, Reagan started wearing a custom, technologically advanced hearing aid, first in his right ear294 and later in his left as well.295 His decision to go public with his wearing the small, audio-amplifying device boosted their sales.296
Judiciary

During his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that, if given the opportunity, he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice.297 That opportunity came in his first year in office when he nominated Sandra Day O'Connor to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart. In his second term, Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren Burger as Chief Justice, and named Antonin Scalia to fill the vacant seat. Reagan nominated conservative jurist Robert Bork to the high court in 1987. Senator Ted Kennedy, a Democrat of Massachusetts, strongly condemned Bork, and great controversy ensued.298 Bork's nomination was rejected 58&lt;U+2013&gt;42.299 Reagan then nominated Douglas Ginsburg, but Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire for his cannabis use.300 Anthony Kennedy was eventually confirmed in his place.301 Along with his three Supreme Court appointments, Reagan appointed 83 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 290 judges to the United States district courts. His total of 376 appointments is the most by any president.
Post-presidential years, 1989&lt;U+2013&gt;2004
 After leaving office in 1989, the Reagans purchased a home in Bel Air, Los Angeles in addition to the Reagan Ranch in Santa Barbara. They regularly attended Bel Air Presbyterian Church302 and occasionally made appearances on behalf of the Republican Party; Reagan delivered a well-received speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention.303 Previously on November 4, 1991, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library was dedicated and opened to the public. At the dedication ceremonies, five presidents were in attendance, as well as six first ladies, marking the first time five presidents were gathered in the same location.304 Reagan continued publicly to speak in favor of a line-item veto; the Brady Bill;305 a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget; and the repeal of the 22nd Amendment, which prohibits anyone from serving more than two terms as president.306 In 1992 Reagan established the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award with the newly formed Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation.307 His final public speech was on February 3, 1994 during a tribute to him in Washington, D.C., and his last major public appearance was at the funeral of Richard Nixon on April 27, 1994.
Alzheimer's disease
Announcement and reaction
In August 1994, at the age of 83, Ronald Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease,308 an incurable neurological disorder which destroys brain cells and ultimately causes death.309310 In November he informed the nation through a handwritten letter,311 writing in part: 
After his diagnosis, letters of support from well-wishers poured into his California home,312 but there was also speculation over how long Reagan had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration.313 Former CBS White House correspondent Lesley Stahl recalls an interview when he was president where &quot;a vacant Reagan barely seemed to realize anyone else was in the room&quot;, and that before he &quot;reemerged into alertness&quot; she recalls that &quot;I had come that close to reporting that Reagan was senile.&quot;314 However, Dr. Lawrence K. Altman, a physician employed as a reporter for the New York Times, noted that &quot;the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of Alzheimer's can be fuzzy&quot;315 and all four of Reagan's White House doctors said that they saw no evidence of Alzheimer's while he was president.316 Dr. John E. Hutton, Reagan's primary physician from 1984 to 1989, said the president &quot;absolutely&quot; did not &quot;show any signs of dementia or Alzheimer's&quot;.317 Reagan did experience occasional memory lapses, though, especially with names.318 Once, while meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, he repeatedly referred to Vice President Bush as &quot;Prime Minister Bush&quot;.319 Reagan's doctors, however, note that he only began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992320 or 1993,321 several years after he had left office. His former Chief of Staff James Baker considered &quot;ludicrous&quot; the idea of Reagan sleeping during cabinet meetings.322 Other staff members, former aides, and friends said they saw no indication of Alzheimer's while he was President.323
 Complicating the picture, Reagan suffered an episode of head trauma in July 1989, five years prior to his diagnosis. After being thrown from a horse in Mexico, a subdural hematoma was found and surgically treated later in the year.324325 Nancy Reagan asserts that her husband's 1989 fall hastened the onset of Alzheimer's disease,326 citing what doctors told her,327 although head trauma has not been conclusively proven to accelerate Alzheimer's.328329 Reagan's one-time physician Dr. Daniel Ruge has said it is possible, but not certain, that the horse accident affected the course of Reagan's memory.330
Progression
As the years went on, the disease slowly destroyed Reagan's mental capacity.331 He was only able to recognize a few people, including his wife, Nancy.332 He remained active, however; he took walks through parks near his home and on beaches, played golf regularly, and often went to his office in nearby Century City.333
Reagan suffered a fall at his Bel Air home on January 13, 2001, resulting in a broken hip.334 The fracture was repaired the following day335 and the 89 year old Reagan returned home later that week, although he faced difficult physical therapy at home.336 On February 6, 2001, Reagan reached the age of 90, becoming the third former president to do so (the other two being John Adams and Herbert Hoover, with Gerald Ford later reaching 90).337 Reagan's public appearances became much less frequent with the progression of the disease, and as a result, his family decided that he would live in quiet isolation. Nancy Reagan told CNN's Larry King in 2001 that very few visitors were allowed to see her husband because she felt that &quot;Ronnie would want people to remember him as he was.&quot;338 Since his diagnosis and death, Mrs. Reagan has become a stem-cell research advocate, urging Congress and President George W. Bush to support federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research, something President Bush opposed. Mrs. Reagan has said that she believes that it could lead to a cure for Alzheimer's.339 President Barack Obama reversed federal opposition to funding embryonic stem cell research in 2009.340
Death
  Reagan died at his home in Bel Air, California on the afternoon of June 5, 2004.341 A short time after his death, Nancy Reagan released a statement saying: &quot;My family and I would like the world to know that President Ronald Reagan has died after 10 years of Alzheimer's Disease at 93 years of age. We appreciate everyone's prayers.&quot;342 President George W. Bush declared June 11 a National Day of Mourning,343 and international tributes came in from around the world.344 Reagan's body was taken to the Kingsley and Gates Funeral Home in Santa Monica, California later in the day, where well-wishers paid tribute by laying flowers and American flags in the grass.345 On June 7, his body was removed and taken to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, where a brief family funeral was held. His body lay in repose in the Library lobby until June 9; over 100,000 people viewed the coffin.346
On June 9, Reagan's body was flown to Washington, D.C. where he became the tenth United States president to lie in state. In the thirty-four hours that it lay there, 104,684 people filed past the coffin.347
On June 11, a state funeral was conducted in the Washington National Cathedral, and presided over by President George W. Bush. Eulogies were given by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,348 former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and both Presidents Bush. Also in attendance were Mikhail Gorbachev, and many world leaders, including British Prime Minister Tony Blair, German Chancellor Gerhard Schr&lt;U+00F6&gt;der, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and interim presidents Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, and Ghazi al-Yawer of Iraq.
After the funeral, the Reagan entourage was flown back to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California, where another service was held, and President Reagan was interred.349 At the time of his passing, Reagan was the longest-lived president in U.S. history, having lived 93 years and 120 days(2 years, 8 months, and 23 days longer than John Adams, whose record he surpassed). He is now the second longest-lived president, just 45 days fewer than Gerald Ford. He was the first United States president to die in the 21st century, and his was the first state funeral in the United States since that of President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1973.
His burial site is inscribed with the words he delivered at the opening of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library: &quot;I know in my heart that man is good, that what is right will always eventually triumph and that there is purpose and worth to each and every life.&quot;350
Legacy
 Reagan's legacy is mixed, but his historical reputation has risen steadily from the time he left office. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy351 and a peaceful end to the Cold War.352 Critics argue that his economic policies caused huge budget deficits, quadrupling the United States national debt,353 and that the Iran-Contra affair lowered American credibility.354 As time has passed, he has generally come to be viewed in a more positive light, and ranks highly among presidents in many public opinion polls.355 In presidential surveys he has consistently been ranked in the first and second quartiles, with more recent surveys generally ranking Reagan in the first quartile of U.S. presidents.
Edwin Feulner, President of the Heritage Foundation, said that Reagan &quot;helped create a safer, freer world&quot; and said of his economic policies: &quot;He took an America suffering from 'malaise'... and made its citizens believe again in their destiny.&quot;356 However, Mark Weisbrot, co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said that Reagan's &quot;economic policies were mostly a failure&quot;,357 and Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post stated that Reagan was &quot;a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest&quot;.358
Many conservative and liberal scholars agree that Reagan has been the most influential president since Franklin D. Roosevelt, leaving his imprint on American politics, diplomacy, culture, and economics. &quot;As of this writing, among academic historians, the Reagan revisionists&lt;U+2014&gt;who view the 1980s as an era of mixed blessings at worst, and of great forward strides in some renditions&lt;U+2014&gt;hold the field&quot;, reports Rossinow (2007).359
The first generation of writing about Reagan comprised studies on the right that approached hagiography, and on the left a devil theory, all relying on popular journalism for their facts. A second generation has emerged, based on newly available documents from the archives, that provides a much more sophisticated and complex view. The scholars of the second generation have reached a consensus,360 as summarized by British historian M. J. Heale, who finds that scholars now concur that Reagan rehabilitated conservatism, turned the nation to the right, practiced a pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics, revived faith in the presidency and in American self respect, and contributed to victory in the Cold War.361
Cold War
The Cold War was a major political and economic endeavor for over four decades, but the confrontation between the two superpowers had decreased dramatically by the end of Reagan's presidency.362 The significance of Reagan's role in ending the Cold War has spurred contentious and opinionated debate.363364 That Reagan had some role in contributing to the downfall of the Soviet Union is collectively agreed, but the extent of this role is continuously debated,365 with many believing that Reagan's defense policies, hard line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism, as well as summits with General Secretary Gorbachev played a significant part in ending the War.366367
 He was notable amongst post-World War II presidents as being convinced that the Soviet Union could be defeated rather than simply negotiated with,368 a conviction that was vindicated by Gennadi Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman under Gorbachev, who said that Star Wars was &quot;very successful blackmail. ... The Soviet economy couldn't endure such competition.&quot;369 Reagan's strong rhetoric toward the nation had mixed effects; Jeffery W. Knopf, Ph.D. observes that being labeled &quot;evil&quot; probably made no difference to the Soviets but gave encouragement to the East-European citizens opposed to communism.370 That Reagan had little or no effect in ending the Cold War is argued with equal weight; that Communism's internal weakness had become apparent, and the Soviet Union would have collapsed in the end regardless of who was in power.371 President Harry Truman's policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the fall of the U.S.S.R., and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan undermined the Soviet system itself.372
General Secretary Gorbachev said of his former rival's Cold War role: &quot;[He was] a man who was instrumental in bringing about the end of the Cold War&quot;,373 and deemed him &quot;a great President.&quot;374 Gorbachev does not acknowledge a win or loss in the war, but rather a peaceful end; he said he was not intimidated by Reagan's harsh rhetoric.375 Margaret Thatcher, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, said of Reagan, &quot;he warned that the Soviet Union had an insatiable drive for military power... but he also sensed it was being eaten away by systemic failures impossible to reform.&quot;376 She later stated, &quot;Ronald Reagan had a higher claim than any other leader to have won the Cold War for liberty and he did it without a shot being fired.&quot;377 Said Brian Mulroney, former Prime Minister of Canada: &quot;He enters history as a strong and dramatic player [in the Cold War].&quot;378 Former President Lech Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa of Poland acknowledged, &quot;Reagan was one of the world leaders who made a major contribution to communism's collapse.&quot;379
Domestic and political legacy
Ronald Reagan reshaped the Republican party, led the modern conservative movement, and altered the political dynamic of the United States.380 More men voted Republican under Reagan, and Reagan tapped into religious voters.381 The so-called &quot;Reagan Democrats&quot; were a result of his presidency.382
Since leaving office, Reagan has become an iconic influence within the Republican party.383 His policies and beliefs have been frequently invoked by Republican presidential candidates since 1989.384 The 2008 Republican presidential candidates were no exception, for they aimed to liken themselves to him during the primary debates, even imitating his campaign stategies.385 Republican nominee John McCain frequently stated that he came to office as &quot;a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution&quot;.386
Cultural and political image
According to columnist Chuck Raasch, &quot;Reagan transformed the American presidency in ways that only a few have been able to.&quot;387 He redefined the political agenda of the times, advocating lower taxes, a conservative economic philosophy, and a stronger military.388 His role in the Cold War further enhanced his image as a different kind of leader.389390

Historically, Ronald Reagan did not have the highest approval ratings as a sitting president,392 but his popularity has increased since 1989. Gallup polls in 2001 and 2007 have ranked him number one or number two when correspondents were asked for the greatest president in history, and third of post-World War II presidents in a 2007 Rasmussen Reports poll, fifth in an ABC 2000 poll, ninth in another 2007 Rasmussen poll, and eighth in a late 2008 poll by United Kingdom newspaper The Times.393394395 In a Siena College survey of over 200 historians, however, Reagan ranked sixteenth out of 42.396397 While the debate about Reagan's legacy is ongoing, the 2009 Annual C-SPAN Survey of Presidential Leaders ranked Reagan the 10th greatest president. The survey of leading historians rated Reagan number 11 in 2000.398 
Reagan's ability to connect with the American people399 earned him the laudatory moniker &quot;The Great Communicator&quot;.400 Of it, Reagan said, &quot;I won the nickname the great communicator. But I never thought it was my style that made a difference&lt;U+2014&gt;it was the content. I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things.&quot;401 His age and soft-spoken speech gave him a warm grandfatherly image.402403404
Reagan also earned the nickname &quot;the Teflon President&quot;, in that public perceptions of him were not tarnished by the controversies that arose during his administration.405 According to Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder, who coined the phrase, and reporter Howard Kurtz, the epithet referred to Reagan's ability to &quot;do almost anything wrong406 and not get blamed for it.&quot;407408
Public reaction to Reagan was always mixed; the oldest president was supported by young voters, and began an alliance that shifted many of them to the Republican party.409 Reagan did not fare well with minority groups, especially African-Americans.410 This was largely due to his opposition to affirmative action policies.411 However, his support of Israel throughout his presidency earned him support from many Jews.412 He emphasized family values in his campaigns and during his presidency, although he was the first president to have been divorced.413 The combination of Reagan's speaking style, unabashed patriotism, negotiation skills, as well as his savvy use of the media, played an important role in defining the 1980s and his future legacy.414
Reagan was known to gibe frequently during his lifetime, displayed humor throughout his presidency,415 and was famous for his storytelling.416 His numerous jokes and one-liners have been labeled &quot;classic quips&quot; and &quot;legendary&quot;.417 Among the most notable of his jokes was one regarding the Cold War. As a sound check prior to his weekly radio address in August 1984, Reagan made the following joke as a way to test the microphone: &quot;My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.&quot;418 Former aide David Gergen commented, &quot;It was that humor... that I think endeared people to Reagan.&quot;419
Honors

Reagan received a number of awards in his pre- and post-presidential years. Following his election as president, Reagan received a lifetime gold membership in the Screen Actors Guild, as well as the United States Military Academy's Sylvanus Thayer Award.420
In 1989, Reagan was created an Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, a British first class knighthood. This entitled him to the use of the post-nominal letters GCB, but did not entitle him to be known as &quot;Sir Ronald Reagan&quot;. Only two American presidents have received the honor&lt;U+2014&gt;Reagan and George H.W. Bush.421 Reagan was also named an honorary Fellow of Keble College, Oxford. Japan awarded him the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum in 1989; he was the second American president to receive the award, but the first to have it given to him for personal reasons (Dwight D. Eisenhower received it as a commemoration of U.S.-Japanese relations).422
 On January 18, 1993, Reagan's former Vice-President and sitting President George H. W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor that the United States can bestow.423 Reagan was also awarded the Republican Senatorial Medal of Freedom, the highest honor bestowed by Republican members of the Senate.424
On Reagan's 87th birthday, in 1998, Washington National Airport was renamed Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport by a bill signed into law by President Clinton. That year, the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center was dedicated in Washington, D.C.425 He was among 18 included in Gallup's List of Widely Admired People of the 20th Century, from a poll conducted of the American people in 1999; two years later, USS Ronald Reagan was christened by Nancy Reagan and the United States Navy. It is one of few Navy ships christened in honor of a living person, and the first aircraft carrier to be named in honor of a living former president.426

A bronze statue of Reagan stands in the Capitol rotunda as part of the National Statuary Hall Collection.

Congress authorized the creation of the Ronald Reagan Boyhood Home National Historic Site in Dixon, Illinois in 2002, pending federal purchase of the property.427 On May 16 of that year, Nancy Reagan accepted the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor bestowed by Congress, on behalf of the president and herself.428
Following Reagan's death, the United States Postal Service issued a President Ronald Reagan commemorative postage stamp in 2005.429 Later in the year, CNN, along with the editors of Time magazine, named him the &quot;most fascinating person&quot; of the network's first 25 years;430 Time listed Reagan one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century as well.431 The Discovery Channel asked its viewers to vote for The Greatest American in an unscientific poll on June 26, 2005; Reagan received the honorary title.432
In 2006, Reagan was inducted into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women, and the Arts.433 Every year since 2002, California Governors Gray Davis and Arnold Schwarzenegger have proclaimed February 6 &quot;Ronald Reagan Day&quot; in the state of California in honor of their most famous predecessor.434 In 2010, Schwarzenegger signed Senate Bill 944, authored by Senator George Runner, to make every February 6 Ronald Reagan Day in California.435
In 2007, Polish President Lech Kaczy&lt;U+0144&gt;ski posthumously awarded Reagan the highest Polish distinction, the Order of the White Eagle, saying that Reagan inspired the Polish people to work for change and helped to unseat the repressive communist regime; Kaczy&lt;U+0144&gt;ski said it &quot;would not have been possible if it was not for the tough-mindedness, determination, and feeling of mission of President Ronald Reagan&quot;.436 Reagan backed the nation of Poland throughout his presidency, supporting the anti-communist Solidarity movement, along with Pope John Paul II.437
On June 3, 2009, Nancy Reagan unveiled a statue of her late husband in the United States Capitol rotunda. The statue represents the state of California in the National Statuary Hall Collection. Following Reagan's death, there was a bipartisan agreement to build a statue of Reagan and replace Thomas Starr King.438 The prior day, President Obama signed the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act into law, establishing a commission to plan activities to mark the upcoming 100th anniversary of Reagan's birth.439
