Laurentia Tan Yen Yi (, ; &lt;U+FF0C&gt;, ) (born 24 April 1979) is a United Kingdom-based Singaporean equestrienne. Born with cerebral palsy and a profound hearing impairment, Tan moved to the United Kingdom with her parents at the age of four. She took up horse riding at five years as a form of physiotherapy. She subsequently completed her A-levels at the Mary Hare Grammar School, a residential special school for the deaf, and graduated with an honours degree from Oxford Brookes University in hospitality management and tourism.
In March 2007, the Riding for the Disabled Association Singapore (RDA) invited Tan to join the Singapore team for the World Para Dressage Championships at Hartpury College in Hartpury, Gloucester, in England in July that year. At this event, her first international competition, she did well enough to qualify for the 2008 Paralympic Games. In September 2008, at the Hong Kong Olympic Equestrian Centre at Sha Tin, she achieved bronze medals in the Individual Championship and Individual Freestyle Tests (class IA). These were Singapore's first Paralympic medals and Asia's first equestrian medals at the Paralympic Games. On 20 September 2008, Tan was conferred the Pingat Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Medal) by the President of Singapore.
Early years and education
Laurentia Tan was born on 24 April 1979 in Singapore.1 She moved with her parents, Anslem, a business director, and Jannie, a local government officer, to London at the age of four years due to her father's work.23 She now lives in New Malden, Surrey.4 Tan has an older brother, Ephraim, who is an aerospace engineer.5 Tan was born with cerebral palsy and profound hearing impairment, and doctors informed her parents that she would probably not be able to walk. Her family decided to settle in the United Kingdom as her parents felt she would be better able to reach her full potential with the medical facilities and specialist educational support available there.6 When she was in school, she fell so often and sustained so many minor injuries that her teachers and the school nurse affectionately nicknamed her &quot;Trouble&quot;. At five years she was unable to sit and walk properly, and took up horse riding at the Diamond Centre for Disabled Riders7 in London as a form of physiotherapy.8 This activity helped her confidence and self-esteem, and eventually enabled her to walk and drive a car.9 As a child, she also played cricket and football with her brother, and swam competitively.10
Tan attended a mainstream school with a unit for the hearing-impaired, where she received speech therapy. She completed her A-levels at the Mary Hare Grammar School, a residential special school for the deaf,11 where she won an Elizabeth Dyson Prize for progress and achievement12 and a prize for business studies.13 From the age of 18, she stopped horse riding for eight years to pursue an honours degree in hospitality management and tourism at Oxford Brookes University,14 and for a job as a mental health worker.1516 However, she missed the sport and took it up again in 2005. She has said, &quot;For me, riding a horse gives me the freedom, movement and energy that my own legs cannot do.&quot;17
Sporting career
In March 2007, the Riding for the Disabled Association Singapore (RDA) contacted Tan and invited her to join the Singapore team for the World Para Dressage Championships, which were a qualifier for the 2008 Summer Paralympics.18 The event, Tan's first international competition, was held at Hartpury College in Hartpury, Gloucester, in England from 18 to 22 July 2007. She achieved 63% or higher in both her Team and Individual Tests, qualifying her to be selected for the 2008 Summer Paralympics. In the Freestyle to Music Test, she was placed fourth in a field of 18 riders with a best score of 67.94%.19
2008 Summer Paralympics
In October 2007, Tan came to Singapore to train daily at RDA with volunteer coach Sally Drummond, who later went to the United Kingdom in April 2008 for two weeks to help her in her Paralympic d&lt;U+00E9&gt;but.20 Tan also resigned her job in June 2008 to train full-time with her coach Penny Pegrum and overcome muscle spasticity.2122 Her first event was the para-dressage Individual Championship Test (grade IA). Riders in this event are categorized into grades I to IV, those in grade I having the most severe disabilities. On 9 September, riding a 20-year-old chestnut gelding loaned to her named Nothing to Lose (also known as Harvey) at the Hong Kong Olympic Equestrian Centre in Sha Tin, Tan scored 68.80% to claim the bronze medal behind the United Kingdom's Anne Dunham (73.10%) and Sophie Christiansen (72.80%). She thus became the first Singaporean to win a Paralympic medal, and the holder of Asia's first Paralympic equestrian medal. She will also receive S$25,000 from the Singapore National Paralympic Council's Athletes Achievement Awards scheme.2324
Two days after achieving the first medal, Tan collected her second bronze with a score of 70.167% for the Individual Freestyle Event, in which she and her horse performed to music.25 The president of the Equestrian Federation of Singapore, Melanie Chew, described her performance as &quot;beyond our expectations&quot;, and that the wins would aid in promoting local awareness of the sport.26
Tan's win sparked discussion about the recognition given to Paralympians in Singapore. A correspondent to the Straits Times criticized the fact that the newspaper had not elaborated on Tan's performance or what was involved in the event, but had &quot;focused almost primarily on her disability&quot;.27 Another letter writer to my paper expressed disappointment that less publicity had been given to Tan's achievement compared to the silver medals won by the Singapore women's table tennis team at the 2008 Summer Olympics.28 In addition, a Today reader noted that Tan would be receiving S$25,000 for her bronze medal, a tenth of the S$250,000 that table tennis players Feng Tianwei, Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu received for their silver medals. He felt that she should receive even more than them, given what she had achieved in spite of her disabilities.29 The President of the Society for the Physically Disabled commented that the disparity between the cash awards given to able-bodied and disabled sportspeople was &quot;disconcerting&quot; and looked forward to a single common scheme, because:

On 16 September, Nominated Member of Parliament Eunice Olsen asked in Parliament if there was a difference in the amount of funding given to Olympians and Paralympians, and why Paralympians receive a much smaller cash reward for medals won compared to Olympians. Teo Ser Luck, Senior Parliamentary Secretary (Community Development, Youth and Sports), said that on a per capita basis disabled sportspeople received about S$106,000 in the current financial year compared to $54,000 for each able-bodied sportsperson as there were 794 registered able-bodied sportspeople but only 16 disabled ones. Teo attributed the disparity in the cash rewards to the fact that Olympians faced higher levels and a larger scale of competition, since disabled sportspeople compete within disability classes. Further, cash rewards were provided by the private sector and Singapore Totalisator Board and were not paid out of state funds. The scheme for Olympians had also been in place for a number of years, while cash rewards for Paralympians were only introduced recently.3031 He said that the government was looking at how it could &quot;develop a aystem to accommodate all athletes that represent Singapore&quot;.32
Tan was conferred the Pingat Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Medal) by the President of Singapore at a ceremony at the Istana Singapore on 20 September 2008.33
