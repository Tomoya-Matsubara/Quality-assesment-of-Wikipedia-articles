ORBCOMM is a company that offers global asset monitoring and messaging services from its constellation of 30 LEO communications satellites orbiting at 775 km. Like its competitors Iridium and Globalstar, it filed for Chapter 11 protection, in September, 2000. ORBCOMM issued a public offering of stock in October 2006 and is listed as . ORBCOMM provide satellite data services, and plans to launch more satellites in 2007.
Each satellite weighs 42 kg (92 lb), and is estimated to cost $1.2 million USD. Two disc-shaped solar panels articulate in 1-axis to track the sun and provide 160 watts of power. Data can be received at 2400 kbit/s and transmitted at 4800  kbit/s. In the continental US, ORBCOMM is committed to relaying 90% of the text messages within 6 minutes.
Amateur reception
Data transmisions from Orbcomm satellites can be decoded by amateurs using a simple VHF radio receiver (scanner) tuned to the band between 137 and 138 MHz to pick up the strong signals from these satellites. With OrbcommPlotter Software, an amateur can decode the telemetry and find out the positions of the satellites, their operational status and their uplink and downlink channels. Unlike most satellite signals, there are so many Orbcomm satellites that there is likely to be one within range of almost any spot on Earth at any time of the day or night.
