Back To Me is the debut solo album by American singer-songwriter Howie Dorough of the Backstreet Boys. The album was released on November 9, 2011.
Background
This is Dorough's first album as a solo artist. He first worked on his solo album in 2002, when the Backstreet Boys was on hiatus, but shelved it when the group reunited in 2003. In 2008 he announced to the fans that he had continued working on his solo album and that the album would have a Latin sound to it. But later on, after much soul-searching he finally changed the direction to pop-dance.1
