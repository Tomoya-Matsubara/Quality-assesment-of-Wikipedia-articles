Timothy Raines (born September 16 1959 in Sanford, Florida), nicknamed &quot;Rock&quot;,1 is a former left fielder in Major League Baseball who played for six teams from 1979 to 2002 and was best known for his 13 seasons with the Montreal Expos. Regarded as one of the top leadoff hitters234 and baserunners in the sport's history, Raines stole at least 70 bases in each of his first six full seasons (1981-1986), leading the National League in stolen bases each season from 1981 to 1984, with a career high of 90 steals in . Raines also led the NL in runs scored twice (1983 and 1987), and in  became the third switch hitter to win the NL batting title, with a .334 average.
With 808 steals in his career, Raines has the fourth-highest total in major league history, behind Rickey Henderson, Lou Brock and Ty Cobb.5 His career stolen base percentage (84.7%) is the highest in major league history for players with 300 or more attempts,6 and he was successful on 40 consecutive steal attempts between July 1993 and August 1995, setting an American League record at the time (the record was broken by Ichiro Suzuki in May , when he completed 45 consecutive steals).
Among switch hitters, Raines ranks sixth in career hits (2,605), fourth in runs (1,571), walks (1,330) and times on base (3,977), fifth in plate appearances (10,359), seventh in singles (1,892), doubles (430), total bases (3,771) and at bats (8,872), eighth in triples (113) and tenth in extra base hits (713). He holds Expos/Washington Nationals franchise records for career runs (947), steals (635), singles (1,163), triples (82) and walks (793), and was the seventh player whose career began after 1945 to retire with over 1,500 runs and 100 triples.7 His 1,966 games in left field ranked seventh in major league history when he retired.
Raines served as the hitting coach for the minor-league Harrisburg Senators in 2007,8 but he did not return for the 2008 season.9
Career
Montreal Expos
The Montreal Expos selected Raines in the 5th round of the 1977 amateur draft. After debuting with six games as a pinch runner in , he played briefly as a second baseman for the Expos in , but soon switched to playing the outfield, and rapidly became a fan favorite due to his aggressiveness on the basepaths. In his strike-interrupted  rookie season, he batted .304 and stole 71 bases â€“ then the second most ever by a rookie, behind only Benny Kauff's 75 for the  Indianapolis Hoosiers in the Federal League. Raines was caught stealing for the first time in 1981, after having begun his career with a major league record 27 consecutive successful stolen bases. Raines was the runner-up for the NL's Rookie of the Year Award in 1981, which was won by Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Fernando Valenzuela.
Raines performance dipped in 1982,10 as he hit .277 with a .353 on base percentage.11 At the end of the season, Raines entered treatment for substance abuse, having spent an estimated $40,000 that year on cocaine.12 To avoid leaving the drug in his locker, Raines carried it in his hip pocket, and slid headfirst when running the bases.13 He used cocaine before games, in his car, after games, and on some occasions, between innings in the clubhouse.14 Raines testified in September, 1985 at the infamous Pittsburgh drug trials.
In 1983, Raines resumed his exciting play, stealing a career high of 90 bases. In each season from 1981 to 1986, Raines stole at least 70 bases. He had a career-high .334 batting average in 1986, winning the National League batting title. Raines maintained a consistently high on base percentage during this period and a rising slugging percentage, reaching a career peak of .429 in 1987. Although he never won a Gold Glove Award, Raines was an excellent defensive player who led the NL with 21 assists in 1983 and tied for the league lead with 4 double plays in 1985.
Raines became a free agent on November 12, ,15 but in spite of his league-leading play, no team made a serious attempt to sign him.16 (During this period, the Major League Baseball owners were acting together to keep salaries down &lt;U+2014&gt; see &quot;Baseball collusion&quot;.) On May 1, , hours after being permitted to negotiate again with Montreal, Raines signed a new deal with the Expos for $5,000,000 over three years, and a $900,000 signing bonus.17 In his first game back on May 2, facing the Mets, although Raines had not participated in spring training or any other competitive preparation for the season, he hit the first pitch he saw off the right-field wall for a triple. Raines finished the game with four hits in five at-bats, three runs, one walk, a stolen base, and a game-winning grand slam in the 10th inning.1819 In spite of the shortened season, Raines led the Expos in runs, walks, times on base, runs created, and stolen bases, in addition to batting average, on base percentage, and slugging percentage.20 He also garnered MVP honors in that year's All-Star Game as he delivered a game-winning triple in the 13th inning. In 1992, Raines was one of dozens of players who were retroactively awarded collusion damages, receiving over $865,000.21
Raines was traded to the Chicago White Sox on December 20, , along with Jeff Carter and a player to be named later (Mario Brito would eventually be agreed upon), in exchange for Iv&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Calder&lt;U+00F3&gt;n and Barry Jones.22
Post-Expos career
Raines played for five seasons with the White Sox. On December 28, , he was traded to the New York Yankees. With the Yankees, Raines received two World Series rings in 1996 and 1998. While his playing time was curtailed due to injuries23, he contributed to a loose clubhouse atmosphere,2425 and was productive when he came up to the plate.26
In January 1999, Raines signed as a free agent with the Oakland Athletics. After a kidney biopsy on July 23, Raines was diagnosed with lupus and spent the rest of the year undergoing treatment and recovery.2728
Recovery and return
Raines was signed by the Yankees as a free agent on February 1, ,29 but was released on March 23.30 On December 21, Raines was signed by the Expos, returning to the team that drafted him.31 With limited playing time, Raines batted .308, with a .433 on base percentage and a .436 slugging percentage.
Raines underwent surgery on May 31 due to a left shoulder strain, and spent time rehabilitating with the Expos triple-A club, the Ottawa Lynx. On August 21, , Raines and his son, Tim Raines, Jr., became the first father-son pair to play against each other in an official professional baseball game, when the Lynx played the Rochester Red Wings (the two had faced each other earlier in the year during spring training).32 Raines returned to the major league club on August 22.
On October 3, the Expos traded Raines to the Baltimore Orioles, thereby permitting Raines to play a major league game with his son.3334 On October 4, Raines, Jr. played center field and Raines, Sr. played left field for Baltimore, becoming the second father and son team to play for the same major league team (a feat previously accomplished by Ken Griffey, Sr. and Ken Griffey, Jr.).35
Raines played his last season in 2002 with the Florida Marlins.
Coaching career
Raines began his coaching career in 2003 as manager of the high class A Brevard County Manatees affiliate of the Expos. He was promoted to the major league team in 2004 and was present for the Expos' final games as a Montreal franchise.
He was a coach for the White Sox from November 2004 until October 2006.36 During the 2005 World Series Championship season, Raines served as first base coach. During the 2006 season, he served as bench coach. He was the hitting coach for the minor-league Harrisburg Senators in 2007,37 but was not retained by the team in 2008.38
Accomplishments
In his 23-year career, Raines hit .294 with 170 home runs, 980 RBI, 1,571 runs, 2,605 hits, 808 stolen bases, 430 doubles, 113 triples and an on base percentage of .385. He hit over .300 in five full seasons, and over .320 in three straight years (1985-1987).
From 1983 to 1987, Total Baseball rated him as one of the NL's five best players each season. He is also listed as the 40th greatest non-pitcher in major-league history according to Bill James's win shares formula, one place ahead of Mark McGwire.
