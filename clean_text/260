A tattie scone or potato scone is a regional variant of the savoury griddle scone which is especially popular in Scotland and the Isle of Man. Many variations of the recipe exist. They generally include liberal quantities of boiled potatoes, butter and salt.
Potato scones are traditionally made as circles of about 90 mm in radius and then cut into quarters. They may also be baked in small rounds.1 They are generally unleavened and are thinner, 7 mm or so, than what is usually considered a scone; they resemble a soft oatcake. They are often served as part of the full Scottish breakfast with fried eggs, bacon and sliced sausage. Alternatively, they are often enjoyed in a roll, usually accompanied with either sliced sausage, bacon, or fried egg.
A typical potato scone is made with mashed potato (potato and butter&lt;U+2014&gt;no milk is used&lt;U+2014&gt;with salt to taste) and plain flour is added to make it into a dough which is then rolled out and put on a griddle to cook.2 They are traditionally served hot, and cold potato scones are often reheated by toasting or frying. Potato scones contain a small proportion of flour to a large proportion of potatoes: one traditional recipe calls for two ounces of flour and half an ounce of butter to a pound of potatoes 3
