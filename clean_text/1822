 Attempts at producing a state of general anesthesia can be traced throughout recorded history in the writings of the ancient Sumerians, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Indians, and Chinese. During the Middle Ages, the scientific culture withered in Europe, but fortunately this period coincided with the Islamic Golden Age, a time when medieval Islamic science flourished. Islamic physicians and other Eastern scholars maintained and advanced the practice of medicine in the Arab World during that period.
The European Renaissance saw significant advances in anatomy and surgical technique. However, despite all this progress, surgery remained a treatment of last resort. Largely because of the associated pain, many patients with surgical disorders chose certain death rather than undergo surgery. Although there has been a great deal of debate as to who deserves the most credit for the discovery of general anesthesia, it is generally agreed that certain scientific discoveries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were critical to the eventual introduction and development of modern anesthetic techniques.
Two &quot;quantum leaps&quot; occurred in the late 19th century, which together allowed the transition to modern surgery. An appreciation of the germ theory of disease led rapidly to the development and application of antiseptic techniques in surgery. Antisepsis, which soon gave way to asepsis, reduced the overall morbidity and mortality of surgery to a far more acceptable rate than in previous eras. Concurrent with these developments were the significant advances in pharmacology and physiology which led to the development of general anesthesia and the control of pain.
In the 20th century, the safety and efficacy of general anesthesia was improved by the routine use of tracheal intubation and other advanced airway management techniques. Significant advances in monitoring and new anesthetic agents with improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics also contributed to this trend. Finally, standardized training programs for anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists emerged during this period.
Etymology of &quot;anesthesia&quot;
The word &quot;anesthesia&quot;, coined by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. (1809&lt;U+2013&gt;1894) in 1846 from the Greek , an-, &quot;without&quot;; and , aisth&lt;U+0113&gt;sis, &quot;sensation&quot;),1 refers to the inhibition of sensation.
Antiquity
  The first attempts at general anesthesia were probably herbal remedies administered in prehistory. Opium poppies were cultivated and harvested in ancient Mesopotamia as early as 4200 BC in Sumeria and succeeding empires. The use of opium-like preparations in anesthesia is recorded in the Ebers Papyrus of 1500 BC. By 1100 BC poppies were scored for opium collection in Cyprus by methods similar to those used today. Simple apparatus for smoking of opium have been discovered in a Minoan temple.
Prior to the introduction of opium to ancient India (ca. 330 BC) and China (ca. AD 600&lt;U+2013&gt;1200), these civilizations pioneered the use of cannabis incense and aconitum. Circa 400 BC, the Sushruta Samhita (a text from the Indian subcontinent on ayurvedic medicine and surgery) advocates the use of wine with incense of cannabis for anesthesia.2
Hua Tuo (&lt;U+83EF&gt;, circa AD 145-208) was a Chinese surgeon of the second century AD. According to the Records of Three Kingdoms (ca. AD 270) and the Book of the Later Han (ca. AD 430), Hua Tuo performed surgery under general anesthesia using a formula he had developed by mixing wine with a mixture of herbal extracts he called mafeisan (&lt;U+9EBB&gt;&lt;U+6CB8&gt;&lt;U+6563&gt;).3 Hua Tuo reportedly used mafeisan to perform even major operations such as resection of gangrenous intestines.4 Before the surgery, he administered an oral anesthetic potion, probably dissolved in wine, in order to induce a state of unconsciousness and partial neuromuscular blockade.5
The exact composition of mafeisan, similar to all of Hua Tuo's clinical knowledge, was lost when he burned his manuscripts, just before his death.6 The composition of the anesthetic powder was not mentioned in either the Records of Three Kingdoms or the Book of the Later Han. Because Confucian teachings regarded the body as sacred and surgery was considered a form of body mutilation, surgery was strongly discouraged in ancient China. Because of this, despite Hua Tuo's reported success with general anesthesia, the practice of surgery in ancient China ended with his death.7
The name mafeisan combines ma (&lt;U+9EBB&gt;, meaning &quot;cannabis, hemp, numbed or tingling&quot;), fei (&lt;U+6CB8&gt;, meaning &quot;boiling or bubbling&quot;), and san (&lt;U+6563&gt;, meaning &quot;to break up or scatter&quot;, or &quot;medicine in powder form&quot;). Therefore, the word mafeisan probably means something like &quot;cannabis boil powder&quot;. Many sinologists and scholars of traditional Chinese medicine have guessed at the composition of Hua Tuo's mafeisan powder, but the exact components still remain unclear. His formula is believed to have contained some combination of:891011

bai zhi (Angelica dahurica),
cao wu (&lt;U+8349&gt;&lt;U+70CF&gt;, Aconitum kusnezoffii, Aconitum kusnezoffii, Kusnezoff's monkshood, or wolfsbane root),
chu&lt;U+0101&gt;n xi&lt;U+014D&gt;ng (Ligusticum wallichii),
dong quai (Angelica sinensis),
wu tou (&lt;U+70CF&gt;&lt;U+982D&gt; &quot;rhizome of Aconitum, Chinese monkshood&quot;),
yang jin hua (&lt;U+6D0B&gt;&lt;U+91D1&gt;&lt;U+82B1&gt;, Flos Daturae metelis, or Datura stramonium),
rhododendron flower, and
jasmine root.

Others have suggested the potion may have also contained Mandragora officinarum, hashish or bhang,1213 or 14 opium.15 Victor H. Mair wrote that mafei &quot;appears to be a transcription of some Indo-European word related to &quot;morphine&quot;.&quot;16 Some authors believe that Hua Tuo may have discovered surgical analgesia by acupuncture, and that mafeisan either had nothing to do with or was simply an adjunct to his strategy for anesthesia.17 Many physicians have attempted to re-create the same formulation based on historical records but none have achieved the same clinical efficacy as Hua Tuo's. In any event, Hua Tuo's formula did not appear to be effective for major operations.1819
Arabic and Persian physicians were among the first to utilize oral as well as inhaled anesthetics. Ferdowsi (940&lt;U+2013&gt;1020) was a Persian poet who lived in the Abbasid Caliphate. In Shahnameh, his national epic poem, Ferdowsi described a caesarean section performed on Rudaba. A special wine prepared by a Zoroastrian priest was used as an anesthetic for this operation.20 Although Shahnameh is mythical in content, the passage nevertheless supports the idea that general anesthesia had at least been attempted in ancient Persia, even if not successfully.
In 1000, Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (936-1013), an Arab physician who lived in Al-Andalus, published the 30-volume Kitab al-Tasrif, the first illustrated work on surgery. In this book, he wrote about the use of general anesthesia for surgery. Circa 1020, Ibn S&lt;U+012B&gt;n&lt;U+0101&gt; (980&lt;U+2013&gt;1037) described the use of inhaled anesthesia in The Canon of Medicine. The Canon described the &quot;soporific sponge&quot;, a sponge imbued with aromatics and narcotics, which was to be placed under a patient's nose during surgical operations.21 Ibn Zuhr (1091&lt;U+2013&gt;1161) was another Arab physician from Al-Andalus. In his 12th century medical textbook Al-Taisir, Ibn Zuhr describes the use of general anesthesia. These three physicians were among many who performed operations under inhaled anesthesia with the use of narcotic-soaked sponges.2223
18th century
 Joseph Priestley (1733&lt;U+2013&gt;1804) was an English polymath who discovered nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, ammonia, hydrogen chloride and (along with Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Antoine Lavoisier) oxygen. Beginning in 1775, Priestley published his research in Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air, a six-volume work.24 The recent discoveries about these and other gases stimulated a great deal of interest in the European scientific community. Thomas Beddoes (1760&lt;U+2013&gt;1808) was an English philosopher, physician and teacher of medicine, and like his colleague Priestley, was also a member of the Lunar Society of Birmingham. With an eye toward making further advances in this new science as well as offering treatment for diseases previously thought to be untreatable (such as asthma and tuberculosis), Beddoes founded the Pneumatic Institution for inhalation gas therapy in 1798 at Dowry Square in Clifton, Bristol.25 Beddoes employed chemist and physicist Humphry Davy (1778&lt;U+2013&gt;1829) as superintendent of the institute, and engineer James Watt (1736&lt;U+2013&gt;1819) to help manufacture the gases. Other members of the Lunar Society such as Erasmus Darwin and Josiah Wedgwood were also actively involved with the institute.
During the course of his research at the Pneumatic Institution, Davy discovered the anesthetic properties of nitrous oxide.26 Davy, who coined the term &quot;laughing gas&quot; for nitrous oxide, published his findings the following year in the now-classic treatise, Researches, chemical and philosophical&lt;U+2013&gt;chiefly concerning nitrous oxide or dephlogisticated nitrous air, and its respiration. Davy was not a physician, and he never administered nitrous oxide during a surgical procedure. He was however the first to document the analgesic effects of nitrous oxide, as well as its potential benefits in relieving pain during surgery:27

 Hanaoka Seish&lt;U+016B&gt; (&lt;U+83EF&gt;&lt;U+5CA1&gt; &lt;U+9752&gt;&lt;U+6D32&gt;, 1760&lt;U+2013&gt;1835) of Osaka was a Japanese surgeon of the Edo period with a knowledge of Chinese herbal medicine, as well as Western surgical techniques techniques he had learned through Rangaku (literally &quot;Dutch learning&quot;, and by extension &quot;Western learning&quot;). Beginning in about 1785, Hanaoka embarked on a quest to re-create a compound that would have pharmacologic properties similar to Hua Tuo's mafeisan.28 After years of research and experimentation, he finally developed a formula which he named ts&lt;U+016B&gt;sensan (also known as mafutsu-san). Like that of Hua Tuo, this compound was composed of extracts of several different plants, including:293031

2 parts bai zhi (Angelica dahurica);
2 parts cao wu (Aconitum sp., monkshood or wolfsbane);
2 parts chu&lt;U+0101&gt;n ban xia (Pinellia ternata);
2 parts chu&lt;U+0101&gt;n xi&lt;U+014D&gt;ng (Ligusticum wallichii, Cnidium rhizome, Cnidium officinale or Szechuan lovage);
2 parts dong quai (Angelica sinensis or female ginseng);
1 part tian nan xing (Arisaema rhizomatum or cobra lily)
8 parts yang jin hua (Datura stramonium, Korean morning glory, thorn apple, jimson weed, devil's trumpet, stinkweed, or locoweed).

The reader will note that five of these seven ingredients were thought to be elements of Hua Tuo's anesthetic potion, 1600 years earlier. Some sources claim that Angelica archangelica (often referred to as garden angelica, holy ghost, or wild celery) was also an ingredient.
The active ingredients in ts&lt;U+016B&gt;sensan are scopolamine, hyoscyamine, atropine, aconitine and angelicotoxin. When consumed in sufficient quantity, ts&lt;U+016B&gt;sensan produces a state of general anesthesia and skeletal muscle paralysis.32 Shutei Nakagawa (1773&lt;U+2013&gt;1850), a close friend of Hanaoka, wrote a small pamphlet entitled &quot;Mayaku-ko&quot; (&quot;narcotic powder&quot;) in 1796. Although the original manuscript was lost in a fire in 1867, this brochure described the current state of Hanaoka's research on general anesthesia.33
On 13 October 1804, Hanaoka performed a partial mastectomy for breast cancer on a 60 year old woman named Kan Aiya, using ts&lt;U+016B&gt;sensan as a general anesthetic. This is generally regarded today as the first reliable documentation of an operation to be performed under general anesthesia.34353637 Hanaoka went on to perform many operations using ts&lt;U+016B&gt;sensan, including resection of malignant tumors, extraction of bladder stones, and extremity amputations. Before his death in 1835, Hanaoka performed more than 150 operations for breast cancer.38394041

  Although Friedrich Sert&lt;U+00FC&gt;rner (1783&lt;U+2013&gt;1841) first isolated morphine from opium in 1804, Victor Mair suggests that &quot;It is conceivable that some such name as morphine was already in use before as a designation for the anesthetic properties of this opium derivative or some other naturally occurring substance.&quot;
Henry Hill Hickman (1800&lt;U+2013&gt;1830) experimented with the use of carbon dioxide as an anesthetic in the 1820s. He would make the animal insensible, effectively via almost suffocating it with carbon dioxide, then determine the effects of the gas by amputating one of its limbs. In 1824, Hickman submitted his the results of his research to the Royal Society. The response was an 1826 article in The Lancet titled 'Surgical Humbug' that ruthlessly criticised his work. Hickman died four years later at age 30. Though he was unappreciated at the time of his death, his work has since been positively reappraised and he is now recognised as one of the fathers of anesthesia.
By the late 1830s, Humphry Davy's experiments had become widely publicized within academic circles in the northeastern United States. Wandering lecturers would hold public gatherings, referred to as &quot;ether frolics&quot;, where members of the audience were encouraged to inhale ether or nitrous oxide to demonstrate the mind-altering properties of these agents while providing much entertainment to on&lt;U+00AD&gt;lookers.42 Four notable men participated in these events and witnessed the use of ether in this manner. They were William Edward Clarke (1819&lt;U+2013&gt;1898), Crawford Long (1815&lt;U+2013&gt;1878), Horace Wells (1815&lt;U+2013&gt;1848), and William T. G. Morton (1819&lt;U+2013&gt;1868).
While attending undergraduate school in Rochester, New York in 1839, classmates Clarke and Morton apparently participated in ether frolics with some regularity.43444546 In January 1842, by now a medical student at Berkshire Medical College, Clarke administered ether to a Miss Hobbie, while Elijah Pope performed a dental extraction.47 In doing so, he became the first to administer to administer an inhaled anesthetic to facilitate the performance of a surgical procedure. Clarke apparently thought little of his accomplishment, and chose not to pursue this technique any further. Indeed, this event is not even mentioned in Clarke's biography.48
Crawford Long was a physician and pharmacist practicing in Jefferson, Georgia in the mid-19th century. During his time as a student at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in the late 1830s, he had observed and probably participated in the ether frolics that had become popular at that time. At these gatherings, Long observed that some participants experienced bumps and bruises, but afterward had no recall of what had happened. He postulated that that diethyl ether produced pharmacologic effects similar to those of nitrous oxide. On 30 March 1842, he administered diethyl ether by inhalation to a man named James Venable, in order to remove a tumor from the man's neck.49 Long later removed a second tumor from Venable, under ether anesthesia. He went on to employ ether as a general anesthetic for limb amputations and parturition. Long however did not publish his experience until 1849, thereby denying himself much of the credit he deserved.50
Horace Wells, a Connecticut dentist, had successfully used nitrous oxide for several dental extractions, but his attempt to demonstrate the use of nitrous oxide on 20 January 1845 at Massachusetts General Hospital with surgeon John Collins Warren was a failure.51
William T. G. Morton was another New England dentist, a former classmate of William Edward Clarke, and a business partner of Horace Wells. On 30 September 1846, Morton administered diethyl ether to Eben Frost, a music teacher from Boston, for a dental extraction. Two weeks later, Morton became the first to publicly demonstrate the use of diethyl ether as a general anesthetic at Massachusetts General Hospital, in what is known today as the Ether Dome.52 On 16 October 1846, John Collins Warren removed a tumor from the neck of a local printer, Edward Gilbert Abbott. Upon completion of the procedure, Warren reportedly quipped, &quot;Gentlemen, this is no humbug.&quot; News of this event rapidly traveled around the world.53 Morton published his experience that year.  Harvard University professor Charles Thomas Jackson (1805&lt;U+2013&gt;1880) later claimed that Morton stole his idea;54 Morton disagreed and a lifelong dispute began.55 For many years, Morton was credited as being the pioneer of general anesthesia in the Western hemisphere, despite the fact that his demonstration occurred four years after Long's initial experience. Long later petitioned William Crosby Dawson (1798&lt;U+2013&gt;1856), a United States Senator from Georgia at that time, to support his claim on the floor of the United States Senate as the first to use ether anesthesia.56
In 1847, Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson (1811&lt;U+2013&gt;1870) of Edinburgh was the first to use chloroform as a general anesthetic. The use of chloroform anesthesia expanded rapidly thereafter in Europe. Chloroform began to replace ether as an anesthetic in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century. It was soon abandoned in favor of ether when its hepatic and cardiac toxicity, especially its tendency to cause potentially fatal cardiac dysrhythmias, became apparent.
In 1871, the German surgeon Friedrich Trendelenburg (1844&lt;U+2013&gt;1924) published a paper describing the first successful elective human tracheotomy to be performed for the purpose of administration of general anesthesia.57585960
In 1880, the Scottish surgeon William Macewen (1848&lt;U+2013&gt;1924) reported on his use of orotracheal intubation as an alternative to tracheotomy to allow a patient with glottic edema to breathe, as well as in the setting of general anesthesia with chloroform.616263 All previous observations of the glottis and larynx (including those of Manuel Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a,64 Wilhelm Hack6566 and Macewen) had been performed under indirect vision (using mirrors) until 23 April 1895, when Alfred Kirstein (1863&lt;U+2013&gt;1922) of Germany first described direct visualization of the vocal cords. Kirstein performed the first direct laryngoscopy in Berlin, using an esophagoscope he had modified for this purpose; he called this device an autoscope.67 The death of Emperor Frederick III (1831&lt;U+2013&gt;1888)68 may have motivated Kirstein to develop the autoscope.69
20th century
 In 1902, Hermann Emil Fischer (1852&lt;U+2013&gt;1919) and Joseph von Mering (1849&lt;U+2013&gt;1908) discovered that diethylbarbituric acid was an effective hypnotic agent.70 Also called barbital or Veronal (the trade name assigned to it by Bayer Pharmaceuticals), this new drug became the first commercially marketed barbiturate; it was used as a treatment for insomnia from 1903 until the mid-1950s.
Until 1913, oral and maxillofacial surgery was performed by mask inhalation anesthesia, topical application of local anesthetics to the mucosa, rectal anesthesia, or intravenous anesthesia. While otherwise effective, these techniques did not protect the airway from obstruction and also exposed patients to the risk of pulmonary aspiration of blood and mucus into the tracheobronchial tree. In 1913, Chevalier Jackson (1865&lt;U+2013&gt;1958) was the first to report a high rate of success for the use of direct laryngoscopy as a means to intubate the trachea.71 Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that had a light source at the distal tip, rather than the proximal light source used by Kirstein.72 This new blade incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope.73
Also in 1913, Henry H. Janeway (1873&lt;U+2013&gt;1921) published results he had achieved using a laryngoscope he had recently developed.74 An American anesthesiologist practicing at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, Janeway was of the opinion that direct intratracheal insufflation of volatile anesthetics would provide improved conditions for otolaryngologic surgery. With this in mind, he developed a laryngoscope designed for the sole purpose of tracheal intubation. Similar to Jackson's device, Janeway's instrument incorporated a distal light source. Unique however was the inclusion of batteries within the handle, a central notch in the blade for maintaining the tracheal tube in the midline of the oropharynx during intubation and a slight curve to the distal tip of the blade to help guide the tube through the glottis. The success of this design led to its subsequent use in other types of surgery. Janeway was thus instrumental in popularizing the widespread use of direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in the practice of anesthesiology.75
Sodium thiopental, the first intravenous anesthetic, was synthesized in 1934 by Ernest H. Volwiler (1893&lt;U+2013&gt;1992) and Donalee L. Tabern (1900&lt;U+2013&gt;1974), working for Abbott Laboratories.76 It was first used in humans on 8 March 1934 by Ralph M. Waters in an investigation of its properties, which were short-term anesthesia and surprisingly little analgesia. Three months later, John Silas Lundy started a clinical trial of thiopental at the Mayo Clinic at the request of Abbott Laboratories. Volwiler and Tabern were awarded U.S. Patent No. 2,153,729 in 1939 for the discovery of thiopental, and they were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1986.
After World War I, further advances were made in the field of intratracheal anesthesia. Among these were those made by Sir Ivan Whiteside Magill (1888&lt;U+2013&gt;1986). Working at the Queen's Hospital for Facial and Jaw Injuries in Sidcup with plastic surgeon Sir Harold Gillies (1882&lt;U+2013&gt;1960) and anesthetist E. Stanley Rowbotham (1890&lt;U+2013&gt;1979), Magill developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation.777879808182 Magill devised a new type of angulated forceps (the Magill forceps) that are still used today to facilitate nasotracheal intubation in a manner that is little changed from Magill's original technique.83 Other devices invented by Magill include the Magill laryngoscope blade,84 as well as several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents.858687 The Magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for Magill.
An anesthesia department was established at the Massachusetts General Hospital in 1936 under the leadership of Henry Knowles Beecher.
Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (1897&lt;U+2013&gt;1989) also achieved significant advances in techniques for tracheal intubation when he introduced his new curved laryngoscope blade in 1943.88 The Macintosh blade remains to this day the most widely used laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation.89 In 1949, Macintosh published a case report describing the novel use of a gum elastic urinary catheter as an endotracheal tube introducer to facilitate difficult tracheal intubation.90 Inspired by Macintosh's report, P. Hex Venn (who was at that time the anesthetic advisor to the British firm Eschmann Bros. &amp; Walsh, Ltd.) set about developing an endotracheal tube introducer based on this concept. Venn's design was accepted in March 1973, and what became known as the Eschmann endotracheal tube introducer went into production later that year.91 The material of Venn's design was different from that of a gum elastic bougie in that it had two layers: a core of tube woven from polyester threads and an outer resin layer. This provided more stiffness but maintained the flexibility and the slippery surface. Other differences were the length (the new introducer was , which is much longer than the gum elastic bougie) and the presence of a 35&lt;U+00B0&gt; curved tip, permitting it to be steered around obstacles.9293
The concept of using a fiberoptic endoscope for tracheal intubation was introduced by Peter Murphy, an English anesthetist, in 1967.94 By the mid-1980s, the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope had become an indispensable instrument within the pulmonology and anesthesia communities.95
21st century
The 20th century saw the transformation of the practices of tracheotomy, endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation from rarely employed procedures to essential components of the practices of anesthesia, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, gastroenterology, pulmonology and surgery. The &quot;digital revolution&quot; of the 21st century has brought newer technology to the art and science of tracheal intubation. Several manufacturers have developed video laryngoscopes which employ digital technology such as the CMOS active pixel sensor (CMOS APS) to generate a view of the glottis so that the trachea may be intubated. The Glidescope video laryngoscope is one example of such a device.9697
Xenon has been used as a general anesthetic. Although it is expensive, anesthesia machines that can deliver xenon are about to appear on the European market, because advances in recovery and recycling of xenon have made it economically viable.98 Two physiological mechanisms for xenon anesthesia have been proposed. The first one involves the inhibition of the calcium ATPase pump&lt;U+2014&gt;the mechanism cells use to remove calcium (Ca2+)&lt;U+2014&gt;in the cell membrane of synapses.99 This results from a conformational change when xenon binds to nonpolar sites inside the protein.100 The second mechanism focuses on the non-specific interactions between the anesthetic and the lipid membrane.101
Xenon has a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of 71%, making it 50% more potent than N2O as an anesthetic. Thus it can be used in concentrations with oxygen that have a lower risk of hypoxia. Unlike nitrous oxide (N2O), xenon is not a greenhouse gas and so it is also viewed as environmentally friendly.102 Xenon vented into the atmosphere is being returned to its original source, so no environmental impact is likely.
