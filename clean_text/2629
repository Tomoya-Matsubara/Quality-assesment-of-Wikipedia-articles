Tamerlan Anzorovich Tsarnaev (&lt;U+0422&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+043C&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+043B&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+0301&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt; &lt;U+0410&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0437&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+0301&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+0432&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0447&gt; &lt;U+0426&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+0301&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0432&gt; ; October 21, 1986 April 19, 2013)1 and his brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev planted bombs at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013.2345 The bombings killed three people and reportedly injured as many as 264 others.6
Shortly after the Federal Bureau of Investigation declared them suspects in the bombings and released images of them, the Tsarnaev brothers killed an MIT police officer, carjacked an SUV, and engaged in a shootout with the police in the Boston suburb of Watertown. According to the federal indictment, during the shootout Tamerlan was captured, but died partly as a result of his brother driving over him, and an MBTA police officer was critically injured in the course of Dzhokhar's escape in the SUV 7 (the latter by what may have been friendly fire).8 Dzhokhar was injured but escaped, and an unprecedented manhunt ensued, with thousands of police searching a 20-block area of Watertown. On the evening of April 19, the heavily wounded Dzhokhar was found unarmed hiding in a boat on a trailer in Watertown just outside the police perimeter, arrested, and taken to a hospital. It was later reported that he was persuaded to surrender when the FBI negotiators mentioned a public plea from his former wrestling coach.9
While still confined to a hospital bed, Dzhokhar was charged on April 22 with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and with malicious destruction of property resulting in death.101112 He was convicted on April 8, 2015, and faces the possibility of the death penalty in the sentencing phase.131415 Dzhokhar allegedly later said during questioning that they next intended to detonate explosives in Times Square in New York City.16 Dzhokhar reportedly also said to authorities that he and his brother were radicalized, at least in part, by watching Anwar al-Awlaki lectures.17 ABC reported on April 23, 2013, that authorities linked Tamerlan to an unsolved triple homicide in nearby Waltham that took place around the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.18
Born seven years apart in different republics of the former Soviet Union, the brothers are half Chechen and half Avar.19 They immigrated to the United States as refugees in 2002. Tamerlan was an aspiring boxer who authorities believe had recently become a follower of radical Islam. Dzhokhar was a student at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth who became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September 11, 2012, seven months before the bombings.20
Family background

The Tsarnaevs were forcibly moved from from Chechnya to the Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan in the years following World War II.21 Anzor Tsarnaev is a Chechen, and Zubeidat Tsarnaeva is an Avar.222324 The couple had two sons, Tamerlan, born in the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic25 in 1986, and Dzhokhar, born in Kyrgyzstan in 1993.26 The parents also have two daughters.272829 Anzor is a traditional Muslim who reportedly shuns religious extremism30 and raised his children Muslim.313233 According to some, other Chechen Americans in the area apparently did not consider the American branch of the family to be fully Chechen because they had not ever lived in Chechnya.34
As children, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar lived in Tokmok, Kyrgyzstan. In 2001, the family moved to Makhachkala, Dagestan, in the Russian Federation.353637 In April 2002, the Tsarnaev parents and Dzhokhar went to the United States on a 90-day tourist visa.383940 Anzor Tsarnaev applied for asylum, citing fears of deadly persecution due to his ties to Chechnya.41
Tamerlan was left in the care of his uncle Ruslan in Kyrgyzstan,42 and arrived in the U.S. around two years later.43 In the U.S. the parents received asylum and then filed for their four children, who received &quot;derivative asylum status&quot;.44 They settled on Norfolk Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Tamerlan lived in Cambridge on Norfolk Street until his death.45
The family as in &quot;was in constant transition&quot; for the next decade.46 Anzor and Zubeidat Tsarnaev both received welfare benefits.47 The father worked as a backyard mechanic and the mother worked as a cosmetologist48 until she lost her job for refusing to work in a business that served men. In March 2007, the family was granted legal permanent residence.49 According to some, other Chechen Americans in the area apparently did not consider them to be fully Chechen because they had not ever lived in Chechnya.50
Early life and education
Tamerlan Anzorovich Tsarnaev (October 21, 1986 &lt;U+2013&gt; April 19, 2013) was born in the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (now Kalmykia), a North Caucasus51 unit of Russia then in the Soviet Union.52 He was a permanent resident of the U.S.,53 a Russian citizen and a Kyrgyz citizen.54
After arriving in the U.S. in 2002, he attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, a public high school.55 He applied for admission at the University of Massachusetts Boston for the fall of 2006, but was rejected.56 He attended Bunker Hill Community College part-time for three terms between 2006 and 2008, studying accounting with hopes of becoming an engineer.5758 He dropped out of school to concentrate on boxing.5960
In 2007, Tamerlan confronted a Brazilian youth who had dated his younger sister, Bella, for about two years, and punched him in the face. A high school friend of Bella said Tamerlan did not approve because the boy was not a Muslim.61
2008
During 2008, Tamerlan became a devout Muslim and stopped drinking and smoking. He began to regularly attend the Islamic Society of Boston mosque near his home in Cambridge, a mosque which Americans for Peace and Tolerance, a longtime critic of the mosque, alleges to support &quot;a brand of Islamic thought that encourages grievances against the West, distrust of law enforcement and opposition to Western forms of government, dress and social values&quot;.62
In May 2008, his sister said her husband was cheating on her and beating her up. Tamerlan flew across the country to Bellingham, Washington, to &quot;straighten up the brains&quot; of his brother-in-law, Khozhugov.63
Tamerlan dated an American, Katherine Russell, from North Kingstown, Rhode Island, on and off while she attended Suffolk University from 2007 to 2010.64 She converted to Islam and started wearing a hijab in 2008.65 Friends said he would shout at her that she was a &quot;slut&quot;.66 They described fights in which he would &quot;fly into rages and sometimes throw furniture or throw things&quot;.67
2009
An aspiring heavyweight boxer, Tamerlan trained at the Wai Kru Mixed Martial Arts Center, a Boston club.68 In 2009&lt;U+2013&gt;10, he was the New England Golden Gloves heavyweight champion, winning the Rocky Marciano Trophy.6970 In May 2009, he fought in the nationals in the 201-pound weight class, but lost a first-round decision.7172
He was arrested at his home at 410 Norfolk Street in Cambridge, on July 28, 2009, for aggravated domestic assault and battery after allegedly assaulting a different girlfriend.73 The woman called 911 &quot;crying hysterically&quot; to report she had been &quot;beat up by her boyfriend&quot;, according to the arrest report.74 His father remarked: &quot;Because of his girlfriend, he hit her lightly, he was locked up for half an hour.&quot; The case was dismissed for lack of prosecution, but his father attributed to it the delay in Tamerlan's gaining U.S. citizenship.7576 This girlfriend said that during a three-year relationship Tamerlan became a radical, tried to force her to convert to Islam and tried to control what she wore and with whom she associated. She also says he cheated on her with the Boston student whom he later married.77
The Tsarnaev brothers' uncle, Ruslan Tsarni, said he &quot;had been concerned about his nephew being an extremist since 2009&quot;. Tsarni said that Tamerlan's radicalization started not during his visit to Russia in January 2012, but much earlier in Boston after he was influenced by a Muslim convert known as &quot;Misha&quot;.78 &quot;Misha&quot; was later identified as Mikhail Allakhverdov, a 39-year-old from Rhode Island (originally from Azerbaijan).79 Allakhverdov told the The New York Review of Books that he rejected violence, was not Tamerlan's teacher, had not spoken to Tamerlan in three years and had never met his family members. Furthermore, he said that he had cooperated with a brief FBI investigation that the NYRB reported had found no ties between Allakhverdov and the attacks.80
2010
According to a 2010 photo essay about him in The Comment, the graduate student magazine of Boston University's College of Communications, Tamerlan said that he was working to become a naturalized citizen in time to be selected for the U.S. Olympic boxing team. He added that he would &quot;rather compete for the United States than for Russia&quot;,8182 while remarking that he &quot;didn't understand&quot; Americans and did not have any American friends.83 He added that he abstained from drinking and smoking, because &quot;God says no to alcohol&quot;84 and that &quot;there are no values anymore. People can't control themselves&quot;.85
Pro super middleweight Edwin Rodriguez sparred with Tsarnaev in 2010, and later said that, although Tsarnaev hit hard, he lacked competitiveness and immediately complained of stomach pain and rib pain. He described Tsarnaev as arrogant but &quot;a coward&quot;.86 Tamerlan Tsarnaev's landlord said the boxer's aspirations were never met because &quot;his back was in really bad shape and he couldn't get into the Olympics&quot;.87 His coach and another boxer described him as talented but cool and arrogant.8889 Rule changes disqualified all non-US citizens from Golden Gloves boxing, ending Tamerlan's boxing career and Olympic hopes.90
According to an aunt in Dagestan, &quot;He started to be really interested in Islam about three years ago [April 2010], but he was never a radical.&quot;91
In the spring of 2010, his girlfriend Katherine Russell became pregnant with Tsarnaev's child and dropped out of college in her senior year to marry92 Tsarnaev on June 21, 2010, in a 15-minute ceremony in an office at the Masjid Al Quran in the Dorchester area of Greater Boston.9394959697 Imam Taalib Mahdee said that he had not met the couple before the ceremony, and Katherine was the one who had called and asked to be married there.98
Tamerlan first came to the attention of Russian security forces in December 2010 when William Plotnikov was briefly detained in Dagestan and forced to disclose his social networking contacts in North America with ties to Russia.99
2011
In early 2011, Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) told the Federal Bureau of Investigation that Tamerlan was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer. The FSB said that he was preparing to leave the United States to travel to the Russian region to join unspecified underground groups.100101 The FBI initially denied that it had contacted Tsarnaev, but then said that it actually had after Tsarnaev's mother talked about the FBI's contacts with her son on RT.102 The FBI said that it interviewed him and relatives of his, but did not find any terrorist activity, and that it provided the results in the summer of 2011.103 At that point, the FBI asked the FSB for more information, but the Russians did not respond to the American request, and the FBI officially closed the case.104
Tsarnaev's mother said that FBI agents had told her they feared Tamerlan was an &quot;extremist leader&quot;, and that he was getting information from &quot;extremist sites&quot;.105106 She said Tamerlan had been under FBI surveillance for at least three years and that &quot;they were controlling every step of him&quot;. The FBI flatly denied this accusation.107108 Tamerlan &quot;vaguely discussed&quot; jihad during a 2011 phone call with his mother that was taped by the FSB, and intelligence officials also discovered text messages in which his mother discussed how Tamerlan was ready to die for Islam.109 In late 2011, the Central Intelligence Agency put both Tamerlan and his mother on its Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment database.110111
Allegations of involvement in 2011 Waltham triple homicide

Two Jewish men, Erik Weissman, and Raphael Teken, as well as their roommate Brendan Mess, were killed in a triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts, on September 11, 2011, the 10-year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.112113114 Each victim's throat had been slit with such great force as to be nearly decapitated. Thousands of dollars worth of marijuana and cash were left covering the victims' bodies, and $5,000 was left at the scene.115 The local district attorney said that it appeared that the killer and the victims knew each other. It was reported on April 23, 2013, that local authorities believed Tamerlan may have been responsible for the triple homicide, and they and the FBI were actively investigating the possibility.116117118119120 In May, forensic evidence connected the two brothers to the scene of the killings, and their cell phone records appeared to place them in the area. The officials cautioned that until more definitive DNA testing is complete, it is still too early to consider bringing an indictment against the younger of the two brothers.121
2012 visit to Russia
Tamerlan traveled to Russia through Moscow's Domodedovo International Airport in January 2012, and returned to the U.S. in July 2012.122 Tamerlan and his wife received public assistance and food stamps from September 2011 to November 2012, which included all the time Tamerlan was in Russia. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva said her son had wanted his wife and their child to move to Dagestan with him, and that: &quot;She herself agreed; she said she wanted to study a different culture, language.&quot;123
During the six months he was overseas, he visited his family in the North Caucasus.
His father said that Tamerlan was with him in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, for six months and that they had done ordinary things, such as visiting relatives. His father also said that he and Tamerlan visited Chechnya twice, to see relatives there and to receive Tamerlan's new Russian passport.124125 While Tsarnaev arrived in Russia in January 2012, however, he only arrived in Dagestan around March, and his father arrived there in May.126 U.S. House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul said he believed that Tamerlan received training during his trip, and became radicalized.127 In an early report, Dagestan's interior minister Abdurashid Magomedov said through a spokesman that Tamerlan &quot;did not have contact with the [Islamist] underground during his visit&quot;.128
A distant cousin of the Tsarnaev brothers, Magomed Kartashov, is a leading intellectual figure in Dagestan's Islamist community. Zubeidat confirmed that they &quot;became very close.&quot; Kartashov's Islamist organization, &quot;The Union of the Just,&quot; advocates Islam as a political system under sharia law. He and Tamerlan discussed fighting the global fight. Kartashov said the Boston bombing is &quot;good&quot; in that it will increase converts to Islam similar to the attacks of September 11.129
According to media reports, Tamerlan was seen by Dagestan police, who were conducting surveillance, making six visits to a known Islamic militant in a Salafi mosque in Makhachkala founded by an associate of Ayman Zawahiri.130131132133 According to Russian investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta, quoting unnamed Russian security sources, Tamerlan was linked to 23-year-old William Plotnikov, an ethnic Russian-Tatar Islamic militant and Canadian citizen, with whom he communicated via online social networking sites.134135136 Tamerlan had also visited Toronto, where Plotnikov lived with his parents.137 Once in Dagestan, Tamerlan is said to have met on several occasions with Makhmud Mansur Nidal, a 19-year-old Dagestani-Palestinian man. Nidal was under close surveillance by Dagestan's anti-extremism unit for six months as a suspected recruiter for Islamist insurgents, before the police killed him in May.138 According to Novaya Gazeta, Tamerlan had sought to join the local insurgency, and was put on a period of 'quarantine' &lt;U+2013&gt; a clearance check by insurgents looking for infiltrating double agents, taking several months for a recruit to be verified. After Tamerlan's alleged contacts were both killed, he &quot;got frightened and fled&quot;. He left Russia in July two days after Plotnikov was killed, in an apparent hurry that Russian authorities considered suspicious, not waiting to pick up his new Russian passport &lt;U+2014&gt; ostensibly one of his main reasons for coming to Russia.139140141142
In an interview, Tsarnaev's father later said he had to force his son to return to the United States to complete his U.S. citizenship application, after Tamerlan tried to convince his family to allow him to stay in Dagestan for good.143
July 2012 return to U.S., through April 2013
Tamerlan returned to the U.S. on July 17, 2012, having grown a long, thick beard.144145146147 His life took on an &quot;increasingly puritanical religious tone&quot; with &quot;Islamist certainty&quot;.148 He appeared, to some family members, to have become an &quot;extremist&quot;.149
After his return to the U.S., Tamerlan created a YouTube channel with playlist links to two videos which were tagged under a category labeled &quot;Terrorists&quot;, including one to Dagestani Islamic militant Amir Abu Dujana (Gadzhimurad Dolgatov, also known as 'Robin Hood', a commander of a small group in the Kizilyurt district, who was killed in battle in late December 2012); the videos were later deleted.150151152153 CNN and the SITE Institute found a screen grab of one of the videos, which featured members of the militant Islamist group Caucasus Emirate from the North Caucasus.154 He also linked to jihadi videos on YouTube, including ones by radical cleric Feiz Mohammad; in one video, voices can be heard singing in Arabic as bombs explode.155156157158 He frequently read extremist sites, including Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's Inspire online magazine.159
Tamerlan applied for U.S. citizenship on September 5, 2012, but Homeland Security held up the application for &quot;additional review&quot; because they found a record of the 2011 FBI interview of him.160
Tamerlan and his wife were receiving state welfare benefits as late as November 2012, but not at the time of the Marathon Bombings in April 2013.161 His wife's lawyer said that Tamerlan was unemployed prior to the bombing162 and had been helping take care of their daughter, while his wife worked over 70 hours a week as a home health care aide, to support her family.163
Tamerlan was pulled over by police in Boston, Brookline, and Cambridge at least nine times in four years. The source does not state which years these were exactly.164
In November 2012, Tamerlan reportedly confronted a shopkeeper at a Middle Eastern grocery store in Cambridge, near a mosque where he sometimes prayed, after seeing a sign there advertising Thanksgiving turkeys. He said &quot;This is kuffar&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;an Arabic reference to non-Muslims&lt;U+2014&gt;&quot;that's not right!&quot;. Also in November 2012, Tamerlan stood up and challenged a sermon in which the speaker said that, just like &quot;we all celebrate the birthday of the Prophet, we can also celebrate July 4 and Thanksgiving,&quot; according to Yusufi Vali, a mosque spokesman. Vali said Tamerlan stated that he &quot;took offense to celebrating anything,&quot; be it the Prophet's birthday (which not all Muslims celebrate) or American holidays.165 In January 2013, Tamerlan again disrupted a Martin Luther King, Jr. Day sermon at a mosque in Cambridge. He objected to the speaker's comparison of Muhammad to Martin Luther King, Jr. Tamerlan was shouted down by members of the congregation and was later asked not to return to the mosque unless he was willing to refrain from shouting during sermons. The mosque said Tamerlan had also disrupted a sermon before.166
2013 Boston Marathon bombings, MIT killing, and carjacking

 Tamerlan is believed to have committed the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15, 2013, and to have killed MIT police officer Sean Collier,167168 though initial reports had described the suspect as a black male wearing black clothing and weighing approximately 120 pounds.169 He is also believed to have committed a carjacking on April 18. His brother Dzhokhar is believed to have been a partner in the crimes.170
Death
In the early hours of April 19, 2013, in Watertown, a suburb of Boston, Tamerlan was apprehended by police after being shot multiple times. The exact sequence of events remains clouded in confusion, as do key details. According to police, Tamerlan's younger brother Dzhokhar ran him over with an SUV and dragged him with the vehicle for ,171 which is substantiated by the federal indictment.172 He was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where, despite efforts to revive him by emergency medical personnel, he was pronounced dead from several critical injuries, massive blood loss, and cardiac and respiratory arrest.173174 Emergency physicians said that he did not appear to have been run over.175 An eyewitness says that he was struck by a police SUV before he was shot multiple times.176
Tamerlan's parents continue to proclaim his innocence. His mother is quoted as saying, &quot;America took my kids away from me. I'm sure my kids were not involved in anything.&quot;177 The imam of a prominent Boston mosque has condemned the violence and distanced itself from the suspects, refusing to give Tamerlan a Muslim burial.178 His body was released to the funeral service hired by the family at 5:30 p.m. EDT May 2, 2013, by the Massachusetts Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.179 His death certificate gives cause of death as gunshot wounds to the torso and extremities, as well as blunt trauma to the head and torso. It is confirmed that he was struck and dragged by a vehicle, in addition to being shot.180
Tamerlan's body was moved to a funeral home in North Attleborough; after protesters picketed the building, it was handed over to Graham, Putnam, and Mahoney Funeral Parlor in Worcester.181 Officials in Boston, Cambridge, at a state prison, and in over 120 other U.S. and Canadian locations refused to allow Tamerlan's body to be buried in their jurisdictions.182 On May 9, Worcester police announced that Tamerlan's body had been buried in an undisclosed location.183 It was later reported that Tsarnaev was buried in a small Muslim cemetery, Al-Barzakh Cemetery, in Doswell, Virginia.184 The burial was set in motion by Martha Mullen of Richmond, Virginia, who said she was appalled by the protests at the funeral home, which she said &quot;portrayed America at its worst&quot; and wanted to find a way to end the impasse. She contacted Islamic Funeral Services of Virginia, which agreed to provide an unmarked plot in their cemetery. The funeral agency released a statement saying &quot;What Tsarnaev did is between him and God. We strongly disagree with his violent actions, but that does not release us from our obligation to return his body to the earth.&quot;185 Caroline County Sheriff Tony Lippa said the burial was legal.186 Locals, as well as the imam of the Virginia Islamic Centre, condemned the secretive burial.187
On June 19, 2013, Tamerlan's name was read aloud (in the context of a victim of gun violence) during a &quot;No More Names&quot; event held in Concord, New Hampshire. In response, Michael Bloomberg's Mayors Against Illegal Guns issued a statement explaining that they were using a list compiled by Slate, and apologized saying that his name was &quot;a mistake&quot; and should have been removed.188
