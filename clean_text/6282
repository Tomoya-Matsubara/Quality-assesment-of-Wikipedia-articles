&quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot; is the second episode of The Simpsons' ninth season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 28, 1997.1 In the episode, Seymour Skinner begins to celebrate his twentieth anniversary as principal of Springfield Elementary School when a man arrives claiming that Skinner has assumed his identity. Principal Skinner admits that his name is actually Armin Tamzarian. He had thought that the real Skinner, a friend from the army, had died in the Vietnam War. Tamzarian decides to leave Springfield forever, only to return later in the episode. The episode was the last written by Ken Keeler and was directed by Steven Dean Moore. It guest starred Martin Sheen as the real Seymour Skinner. Although it was produced by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein as part of the season eight production code, it aired during the ninth season as a holdover.2 The title of the episode is a reference to the book The Prince and the Pauper by Mark Twain.3
&quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot; has become one of the most controversial episodes of The Simpsons. Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the fact that Principal Skinner, who had been a recurring character since the first season, was suddenly revealed to be an imposter. The episode received criticism from series creator Matt Groening and Harry Shearer, the voice actor of Principal Skinner. Despite this, Ken Keeler considers the episode to be the best work he has ever done for television. The episode received generally negative reviews in several articles and books on The Simpsons.
Plot
 Seymour Skinner prepares to celebrate his 20th anniversary as school principal. The celebration goes well, until a man arrives who claims his name is Seymour Skinner and that Agnes Skinner is his biological mother. Principal Skinner admits he is not the real Seymour Skinner, and is an impostor named Armin Tamzarian. He reveals he was a punk who stole an old woman's purse and hit a judge with a motorcycle in his teenage years. The judge gave him three choices: apologize, join the army, or jail. Armin chose the army, unaware that the country was in the middle of the Vietnam War. There he met the real Sergeant Seymour Skinner and warmed up to him as a friend. Skinner showed Armin his mother's picture in a locket and said that his dream was to be an elementary school principal. Seymour eventually ran a clearing just as someone bombed the place, causing Armin to take the news of Seymour's death to his mother. He could not do it, however, and instead assumed Skinner's identity. Agnes also could not accept that her son had died, and whispered to Armin that &quot;your room is the third door on the left,&quot; implying she knew the truth but accepted his ruse.
Now that the real Skinner has turned up alive, he still wants to fulfil his dream, and argues that since someone pretending to be him had the job of school principal, the real one ought to be even better at it (it is unclear if the real Skinner actually possessed any qualifications for the position prior to being stationed in Vietnam). He gets the job, but it soon turns out that Springfield prefers Tamzarian over the real Skinner. Tamzarian, however, had left Springfield and gone to Capital City on his old motorcycle. Marge devises a plan to get Tamzarian back to Springfield, and she heads off for Capital City with Homer, Lisa, Edna Krabappel, Agnes Skinner, Grampa, Bart, Maggie and for an unknown reason, Jasper. After Agnes orders Armin to return home, Homer convinces Mayor Quimby and all the other citizens to allow Armin to stay. However, Sergeant Skinner refuses to give up his dignity just because they prefer Armin over him. Homer comes up with a way of letting Skinner keep his dignity and let Armin Tamzarian get his old job back. The plan consists of giving Sergeant Skinner a &quot;dignified&quot; parade which actually serves to run him out of town, tied to a chair on a freight train car. Tamzarian returns to his role as Principal Skinner through an order by Judge Snyder. Judge Snyder declares that no one will mention &quot;Tamzarian&quot; again under penalty of torture and that Tamzarian will retain the name of Principal Skinner, rather than using his birth name.
Production
&quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot; was the last episode written by Ken Keeler, who had also pitched the original idea for the episode. Keeler would often be given difficult episodes to write. At the time of production, there was little opposition, although Harry Shearer was &quot;a little peeved.&quot;4 Principal Skinner was a favorite of Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and they felt that the episode would be an interesting exploration of who he was.5 Keeler named the fake Seymour after Armin Tamzarian, a claims adjuster who assisted after a car accident years before.6 Tamzarian later became a lawyer in the firm that represented the series.7 Martin Sheen was selected to voice the real Seymour Skinner because the producers loved his performance in Apocalypse Now, feeling his voice would be an appropriate fit for a Vietnam veteran.8 One of the possible titles of the episode was &quot;Skinnersby&quot;, a reference to the film Sommersby.9 The title of the episode is a reference to the book The Prince and the Pauper by Mark Twain.10
Controversy
&quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot; caused much controversy amongst fans and critics, who reacted negatively to the episode.11 Principal Skinner had been a recurring character since the first season, and his character was suddenly changed after years of development when he was revealed to be an imposter. The episode ended with a self-referential deus ex machina, which left viewers to either &quot;reset&quot; or accept the change.12 Bill Oakley considers it the most controversial episode of his tenure as executive producer.13
Concept

The producers decided to try something different for the episode, but many fans reacted negatively.14 During their time as showrunners, Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein liked to make episodes that pushed the boundaries. This episode was proposed in the same vein, although they feel that part of the problem is that it didn't initially present itself as being an envelope pusher.15 Ken Keeler based the script on the Tichborne Case, not the story of Martin Guerre as is commonly believed.16 Keeler feels that the episode is about people who hate change and how they will try to keep things the way they are, even if the change has little to do with them. The new Skinner was made to be a nice guy, but just not quite Skinner and which is why people were against him.17 In the original draft, there were two sentences that Keeler felt illustrated this point even better and would have made all of the difference in the episode. However, they were cut for time.18 The writers wanted the episode's ending to fully reset to the point before Skinner is revealed as an impostor so that the audience need not consider the Tamzarian back story part of Skinner's character.19
Reaction from the production staff
 Although the episode initially received little opposition from the show's production staff,20 it has since been both defended and criticized by several. In the DVD commentary for the episode, it is described as &quot;a good episode&quot; by Bill Oakley21 and is also defended by Josh Weinstein22 and director Steven Dean Moore, who said it is his favorite episode that he directed.23 Ken Keeler himself said, &quot;I am very proud of the job I did on this episode. This is the best episode of television I feel I ever wrote.&quot;24
Others have criticized it, including Harry Shearer, the voice of Principal Skinner.25 In a 2001 interview with the Dallas Observer, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, &quot;That's so wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters. It's so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it's disrespectful to the audience.&quot;26 In the Season 9 DVD boxset introduction from Matt Groening, he describes &quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot; as one of his least favorite episodes, although he does not elaborate.27
Reception
&quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot; attracted approximately nine million viewers when it first aired in the United States.28 In his book Leaving Springfield, John Alberti notes that the episode was &quot;reviled by many of the fans ... for its dispensing with series continuity.&quot;29 Chris Turner writes in Planet Simpson that he feels the episode marks the abrupt end of the &quot;Golden era&quot; and that it &quot;remains to this day among the weakest episodes in Simpsons history.&quot;30 Turner also writes that &quot;such a blatant, continuity-scrambling plot twist of this sort might've been forgivable if the result had been as funny or sharply satirical as the classics of the Golden Age, but alas it's emphatically not.&quot;31 In an article in The Observer, Giles Richards notes this &quot;Golden Age&quot; referred to by Turner, which runs from &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot; in season three through &quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot;.32 Richards disagrees with Turner's assessment that the show plateaued after &quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot;.33 In Paul A. Cantor's Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization, he calls the decision of The Simpsons producers to develop the Armin Tamzarian story &quot;a fit of madness.&quot;34 Alan Sepinwall writes in a 2003 article in The Star-Ledger &quot;Season Nine's &quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot;, in which Principal Skinner was revealed to be an impostor, was so implausible that even the characters were disavowing it by the end of the episode.&quot;35 In a 2006 article in The Star-Ledger, Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz cite the episode when asserting that the quality of The Simpsons episodes &quot;gets much spottier&quot; after season nine.36
The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, have defended the episode, calling it &quot;one of the series' all-time best episodes, mainly because it shows us a human side, not just of Principal Skinner, but of his hectorish Mom as well.  Martin Sheen steals the show though in a brief but important slice of Simpsons history.&quot;37
Legacy
A clip from the episode was used in season eleven's &quot;Behind the Laughter&quot; as an example of the show's increasingly &quot;gimmicky and nonsensical plots&quot;.38 This episode was also referenced by Lisa in the season fifteen episode &quot;I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot&quot;, when she tells Skinner &quot;I guess it is, Principal Tamzarian,&quot; after he complains about Lisa naming her new cat Snowball II, who had died earlier in the episode.39
