Alzheimer's disease AD, also called Alzheimer disease or simply Alzheimer's, is the most common form of dementia. This incurable, degenerative disease degenerative and Terminal illness terminal disease was first described by German psychiatrist Alis Alzheimer in 1901. Generally it is diagnosed in people over 65&nbsp;years of age,cite journal

 although the less-prevalent early-onset Alzheimer's can occur much earlier. An estimated 26.6&nbsp;million people worldwide were afflicted by Alzheimer's in 2006; this number may quadruple by 2050.

Although each sufferer experiences Alzheimer's in unique ways, there are many common symptoms.

 The most commonly recognised early symptom is memory loss, such as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts. When a doctor or physician has been notified, and AD is suspected, the diagnosis is usually confirmed with behavioural assessments and cognitive tests, often followed by a neuroimaging brain scan if available.

The cause and progression of Alzheimer's disease are not well understood.  Research indicates that the disease is associated with Senile plaques plaques and neurofibrillary tangles tangles in the brain. Currently used treatments offer a small symptomatic benefit; no treatments to delay or halt the progression of the disease are as yet available. As of 2008, more than 500 clinical trials were investigating possible treatments for AD, but it is unknown if any of them will prove successful.cite web

 Many measures have been suggested for the preventive medicine prevention of Alzheimer's disease, but their value is unproven in slowing the course and reducing the severity of the disease. Mental exercise Mental stimulation, exercise and a balanced diet are often recommended, as both a possible prevention and a sensible way of managing the disease.

Characteristics
The disease course is divided into four stages, with a progressive pattern of cognitive and functional impairment.  
Predementia
The first symptoms are often mistaken as related to ageing or Stress medicine stress. Detailed neuropsychology neuropsychological testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties up to eight years before a person fulfils the clinical criteria for diagnosis of AD.Preclinical:

Moderate dementia
People with AD can usually care for themselves during the early stages of the disease, but progressive deterioration hinders independence. Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions paraphasias. Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost.

Neuropathology

Alzheimer's disease is characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy of the affected regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, and parts of the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus.cite journal

 Plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of amyloid-beta protein and cellular material outside and around neurons. They continue to grow into insoluble twisted fibres within the nerve cell, often called tangles. Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles as a consequence of ageing, the brains of AD patients have a greater number of them in specific brain regions such as the temporal lobe.cite journal

Image:TANGLES HIGH.jpg right thumb In Alzheimer's disease, changes in tau protein lead to the disintegration of microtubules in brain cells.

AD is also considered a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Healthy neurons have a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly made up of structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules from the body of the cell to the ends of the axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylation phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming Hyperphosphorylation hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.cite journal

Causes

Three major competing hypotheses exist to explain the cause of the disease. The oldest, on which most currently available drug therapies are based, is the cholinergic hypothesis and suggests that AD is due to reduced synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The cholinergic hypothesis has not maintained widespread support due to the reduced efficacy of medications that treat acetylcholine deficiency, although cholinergic effects have been proposed to initiate large-scale aggregation,cite journal

Prevention
Image:Honor Daumier 032.jpg right thumb Intellectual activities such as playing chess or regular social interaction have been linked to a reduced risk of AD in epidemiological studies, although no causal relationship has been found.

Global studies of measures to prevent or delay the onset of AD have had contradictory results, have not proven causal relationships between risk factors and the disease or have been attributed to secondary effects. There appears to be no definitive measures to prevent the onset of AD.Prevention recommendations not supported:

Only further research, including clinical trials, will reveal whether, in fact, these factors can help to prevent AD.

Management
There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease; available treatments offer relatively small symptomatic benefit but remain palliative care palliative in nature. Current treatments can be divided into pharmaceutical, psychosocial and caregiving.

Image:Memantine.svg right thumb  Upright Molecular structure of memantine, a medication approved for advanced AD symptoms
Four medications are currently approved by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA and the European Medicines Agency EMEA to treat the cognitive manifestations of AD: three are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the other is memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist. No drug has an indication for delaying or halting the progression of the disease.

Emotion-oriented interventions include reminiscence therapy, validation therapy, supportive psychotherapy, sensory integration, also called  snoezelen, and simulated presence therapy. Supportive psychotherapy has received little or no formal scientific study, but some clinicians find it useful in helping mildly impaired patients adjust to their illness. Reminiscence therapy RT involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times with the aid of photographs, household items, music and sound recordings, or other familiar items from the past. Although there are few quality studies on the effectiveness of RT, it may be beneficial for cognition and Mood psychology mood.cite journal

The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, which include reality orientation and Rehabilitation neuropsychology cognitive retraining, is the reduction of cognitive deficits. Reality orientation consists in the presentation of information about time, place or person in order to ease the understanding of the person about its surroundings and his place in them. On the other hand cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities. Both have shown some efficacy improving cognitive capacities,cite journal

 although in some studies these effects were transient and negative effects, such as frustration, have also been reported.

Stimulation-oriented treatments include Art therapy art, Music therapy music and Animal-assisted therapy pet therapies, Physical therapy exercise, and any other kind of Recreational therapy recreational activities. Stimulation has modest support for improving behaviour, mood, and, to a lesser extent, function. Nevertheless, as important as these effects are, the main support for the use of stimulation therapies is the improvement in the person's daily life routines.

Caregiving
Further Caregiving and dementia

Since Alzheimer's has no cure and it gradually renders people incapable of tending for their own needs, caregiving essentially is the treatment and must be carefully managed over the course of the disease.

During the early and moderate stages, modifications to the living environment and lifestyle can increase patient safety and reduce caretaker burden.cite journal

 The use of physical restraints is rarely indicated in any stage of the disease, although there are situations when they are necessary to prevent harm to the person with AD or their caregivers. 

As the disease progresses, different medical issues can appear, such as dental disease oral and dental disease, Bedsore pressure ulcers, malnutrition, hygiene problems, or Respiratory system respiratory, skin, or eye infections. Careful management can prevent them, while professional treatment is needed when they do arise.Medical issues:

Prognosis
The early stages of Alzheimer's disease are difficult to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. He will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living.

Life expectancy of the population with the disease is reduced.cite journal

 The mean life expectancy following diagnosis is approximately seven years. Fewer than 3% of patients live more than fourteen years. Disease features significantly associated with reduced survival are an increased severity of cognitive impairment, decreased functional level, history of falls, and disturbances in the neurological examination. Other coincident diseases such as Heart disease heart problems, Diabetes mellitus diabetes or history of alcohol abuse are also related with shortened survival.cite journal

Two main measures are used in epidemiology epidemiological studies: incidence and prevalence. Incidence epidemiology Incidence is  the number of new cases per unit of person-time at risk usually number of new cases per thousand person-years; while prevalence is the total number of cases of the disease in the population at a given time.

Regarding incidence, cohort study cohort longitudinal studies studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years provide rates between 1015 per thousand person-years for all dementias and 58 for AD,cite journal

 which means that half of new dementia cases each year are AD. Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every five years after the age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 2 to as much as 69 per thousand person years. There are also sex differences in the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85.cite journal

Prevalence of AD in populations is dependent upon different factors including incidence and survival. Since the incidence of AD increases with age, it is particularly important to include the mean age of the population of interest. In the United States, Alzheimer prevalence was estimated to be 1.6% in the year 2000. In the 6574 age group, approximately 5% of the U.S. population has AD, with the rate increasing to nearly 20% in the 7584 group and to 50% in the greater than 84 group.cite journal

For most of the twentieth century, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was reserved for individuals between the ages of 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of dementia. The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and pathological manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not rule out the possibility of different etiology aetiologies.cite book

 while costs of Alzheimer in the United States may be $100&nbsp;billion each year.

The greatest origin of costs for society is the long-term care by Health care provider health care professionals and particularly institutionalisation, which corresponds to 2/3 of the total costs for society. The cost of living at home is also very high, specially when informal costs for the family, such as caregiving time and caregiver's lost earnings, are taken into account.cite journal

 Therefore any treatment that slows cognitive decline, delays institutionalisation or reduces caregivers hours will have economic benefits. Economic evaluations of current treatments have shown positive results.

 Regarding economic problems, family caregivers often give up time from work to spend 47&nbsp;hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs of caring for them are high. Direct and indirect costs of caring for an Alzheimer's patient average between $18,000 and $77,500 per year in the United States, depending on the study.

Research directions
 
Main Alzheimer's disease clinical research

As of 2008, the safety and efficacy of more than 400 pharmaceutical treatments are being investigated in clinical trials worldwide, and approximately one-fourth of these compounds are in Phase III trials, which is the last step prior to review by regulatory agencies.cite web
  url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=alzheimer

One area of clinical research is focused on treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of amyloid beta levels is a common target of compounds under investigation. Immunotherapy or vaccination for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study. Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy would be used to treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease.Vaccination:
