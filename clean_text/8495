The 2012 Tour de France was the 99th edition of the Tour de France. It began with a prologue time trial in the city of Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge in Belgium,12 and reached its conclusion on the Champs-&lt;U+00C9&gt;lys&lt;U+00E9&gt;es in Paris. As well as the prologue, the first two road stages took place in Belgium, and one stage finished in Switzerland.
The route was accidentally leaked by the ASO on its website on 10 October 2011,3 eight days before the official presentation.The route featured a total of 101.1 km4 in individual time trials and three uphill finishes: La Planche des Belles Filles (stage 7), La Toussuire - Les Sybelles (stage 11) and Peyragudes (stage 17). The Col du Grand Colombier, a climb that had previously featured in the Crit&lt;U+00E9&gt;rium du Dauphin&lt;U+00E9&gt;, Tour de l'Avenir and the Tour de l'Ain, was included for the first time, and was among six hors cat&lt;U+00E9&gt;gorie rated climbs in the Alps and Pyrenees. 5
Bradley Wiggins () won the overall race, 3' 21&quot; clear of compatriot and teammate Chris Froome. They became the first British riders to finish in the top three in the general classification. The yellow jersey was worn for the first week by Switzerland's Fabian Cancellara (), who won the prologue.6 Wiggins, second in the prologue, took the leadership of the race on stage 7, the first mountainous stage, which was won by Froome,7 and maintained his lead throughout the rest of the race, winning both the long time trials, and not losing time to his main challengers for the overall title in the mountains. Froome came second in both the long time trials, and was alongside, or slightly ahead of, Wiggins on the mountainous stages. Italian Vincenzo Nibali () was third place overall and the only rider to consistently keep pace with Wiggins and Froome in the mountains.
The points classification for the most consistent finisher was won by Nibali's Slovakian teammate Peter Sagan. Sagan won three stages, and was second or third in four others: German sprinter Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Greipel of , and world champion Mark Cavendish, another British rider on , both also won three stages, but were less consistent in other sprints. 's French rider Thomas Voeckler, winner of two mountainous stages and top scorer on seven successive cols, won the King of the Mountains title, and 's American rider Tejay van Garderen, in fifth place overall, won the award for the best young rider, while the team competition was won by , and Chris Anker S&lt;U+00F8&gt;rensen was given the award for the most combative rider.

Pre-race favourites
2011 winner Cadel Evans attempted to defend his Tour title, but lost time on two key mountain stages and finished in seventh place. Runner-up Andy Schleck (and later declared 2010 winner) was not in the Tour due to a fracture of the sacral bone of his pelvis at the Crit&lt;U+00E9&gt;rium du Dauphin&lt;U+00E9&gt;.9 The third still-active former Tour de France winner Alberto Contador is suspended and did not start in this year's Tour.
Other former Grand Tour winners who took part in this Tour de France were: Denis Menchov (2009 Giro d'Italia, and 2005 and 2007 Vuelta a Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;a: finished 15th), Alexander Vinokourov (2006 Vuelta a Espana: finished 31st), Alejandro Valverde (2009 Vuelta a Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;a: finished 20th), Vincenzo Nibali (2010 Vuelta a Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;a: finished 3rd), Juan Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Cobo (2011 Vuelta a Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;a: finished 30th), Ivan Basso (2006 Giro d'Italia and 2010 Giro d'Italia: finished 25th), Michele Scarponi (2011 Giro d'Italia: finished 24th) and Ryder Hesjedal (2012 Giro d'Italia: withdrew injured).101112
According to many critics before the race the favourite was the eventual winner, British rider Bradley Wiggins.1314 Having finished fourth in the 2009 edition and been a podium finisher in the 2011 Vuelta a Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;a, Wiggins had already showed good form during the season by winning the overall title in the stage races Paris-Nice, Tour de Romandie and the Crit&lt;U+00E9&gt;rium du Dauphin&lt;U+00E9&gt;.

Classification leadership
 There were four main classifications contested in the 2012 Tour de France, with the most important being the general classification. The general classification was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification was considered the winner of the Tour.16 In 2012, there were no time bonuses given.17
Additionally, there was a points classification, which awards a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists get points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and is identified with a green jersey.18
There was also a mountains classification. The organization categorized some climbs as either hors cat&lt;U+00E9&gt;gorie, first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reach the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and was identified with a polka dot jersey.19
The fourth individual classification was the young rider classification, marked by the white jersey. This classification was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1987.20
For the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team is the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that lead this classification were identified with yellow numbers21 and for the first time in 2012, helmets.
For the combativity award, a jury gives points after each stage to the cyclists they considered most combative. The cyclist with the most votes in all stages leads the classification.22
