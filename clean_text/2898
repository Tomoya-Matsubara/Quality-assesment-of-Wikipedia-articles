The Qinling Mountains () are a major mountain range located mainly in the Eastern province of Shaanxi, in China. The mountains provide a natural boundary between the North and South of the country, and support a huge variety of plant and wildlife, some of which is found nowhere else on Earth.
The Northern side of the range is prone to cold weather, however the physical barrier of the mountains mean that the land to the South enjoys a sub-tropical climate, with the rich, fertile landscape supporting a wealth of wildlife and vegetation.1 The mountains also acted as a natural defense against nomadic invasions from the North, as only four passes cross the mountains. In the late 1990s a railway tunnel and a spiral 2 was completed, thereby easing travel across the range.3 The highest mountain in the range is Mount Taibai, (3,767 metres), which is around 100 kilometres West of the ancient Chinese capital of Xi'an.4
