Club career
Spence started his career with Irish League club Crusaders in 1969, before making the short trip to England in 1970 to join Fourth Division side Oldham Athletic. He spent one year at Boundary Park, making just six league appearances for the Latics, before joining Bury in 1972. It was at Gigg Lane that he spent the majority of his thirteen-year career and scored the most league goals - 44 in 140 league games.1  In 1976, Spence joined Second Division side Blackpool, and made his debut for the Seasiders against Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest on 16 October. He complemented the twin striking powers of Mickey Walsh and fellow new signing Bob Hatton. However, at the end of the season he found his place under threat from Stan McEwan.
A serious injury kept Spence out of the entire 1977-78 campaign, which ended with Blackpool's relegation to the Third Division for the first time in their history.
Spence then joined Greek Alpha Ethniki club Olympiacos, where he made 21 league appearances, scoring six goals. He then returned to Blackpool then playing in the Third Division, and joined forces with Tony Kellow, who had signed from Exeter City. Between them, they scored 27 goals in the 1978&lt;U+2013&gt;79 season, nearly half of the team's total, with Spence top scorer on sixteen goals.
On 26 December 1979, in a game against Hull City at Bloomfield Road, Spence suffered an injury serious enough that it eventually forced his premature retirement from the game. In 1980, he moved to Fourth Division side Southend United, helping them to win promotion in the 1980&lt;U+2013&gt;81 season as champions. He scored 32 goals in 104 games over a two-year period.
Between 1982 and 1986, Spence spent spells with Dutch club Sparta Rotterdam and Hong Kong clubs Sea Bee and Hong Kong Rangers before finishing his professional career with a second spell at Bury in 1986.2 He retired in 1986 at the age of 34 and eventually hung up his boots in Non-League football with Oldham Town in the North West Counties Football League.
International career
Spence won his first Northern Ireland cap on 16 March 1975, in a single-goal victory over Yugoslavia in Belfast. He went on to win 29 caps in total, scoring three goals. His most notable appearance occurred on 13 October 1976, when he came on as a late substitute and scored a late equaliser against the Netherlands in a World Cup qualifying game in Rotterdam.3
He ended his international career after discovering, via Teletext, that Billy Bingham had left him out of the 1982 World Cup squad.
