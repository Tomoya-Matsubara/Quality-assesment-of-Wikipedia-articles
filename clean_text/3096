This is a list of Doctor Who television serials. Each serial up to 1989's Survival, with the exception of one cutaway and one telemovie, was a multi-episode story; the characters in the column after the serial titles indicate the code used by the production team to designate the serial (where applicable) and are followed by the number of episodes in the serial. Unless otherwise noted, episodes in this period are 25 minutes long.
A number of serials from the 1960s are either missing or incomplete, while some of the episodes from the early 1970s are only held in black and white. See the list of incomplete Doctor Who serials for more details.
The three-digit story numbers are not official designations but are merely to serve as a guide to where the story stands in the overall context of the programme. There is some dispute about, for example, whether to count Season 23's The Trial of a Time Lord as one or four serials,1 and whether the uncompleted Shada should be included.2 The numbering scheme used here reflects that used in sources such as The Discontinuity Guide, Outpost Gallifrey and DVD releases, which count Trial as four serials and include Shada.
Starting with the 2005 revival, the production team abandoned the traditional serial format for a largely self-contained episodic format with occasional multi-part story and loose story arcs, similar to the style of American dramas such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer or The X-Files. Unless otherwise noted, the new episodes are 45 minutes long.
In the first two seasons and most of the third season, each episode of a serial has an individual title; no serial has an overall onscreen title until The Savages. However, the earlier stories are generally referred to by &quot;umbrella&quot; titles that are not used onscreen; much debate over these titles has ensued over the years, with different sources often using different titles for various reasons. The titles in this list are generally those used for commercial release.
During the early seasons of the programme most serials are linked together, one usually leading directly into the next &lt;U+2014&gt; although there are some breaks, such as between the second season finale, The Time Meddler, and the third season premiere, Galaxy 4. 
First Doctor
The first televised incarnation of The Doctor was played by William Hartnell. During Hartnell's tenure, the Doctor visited a mixture of both stories set in the future and historical events that had no extraterrestrial influence, such as fifteenth century Mesoamerica. In his last story, The Tenth Planet, the First Doctor gradually grew weaker until collapsing and regenerating at the end of episode four.
Season 1 (1963-64)
Verity Lambert was producer for the first season, and retained the position until &quot;Mission to the Unknown&quot;. David Whitaker served as script editor until The Dalek Invasion of Earth.

Season 18 (1980-81)
This was the first season produced by John Nathan-Turner; Christopher H. Bidmead served as script editor. In a return to the format of early seasons, virtually all serials from Seasons 18 through 20 are linked together, often running directly into each other. Season 18 forms a loose story arc dealing with the theme of Entropy. Full Circle, State of Decay, and Warriors' Gate trace the Doctor's adventures in E-Space; they were released as a VHS set with the umbrella title, The E-Space Trilogy.

Eighth Doctor
The Eighth Doctor was played by Paul McGann. The movie is the first and only television appearance of this Doctor. The only production title held by this story was Doctor Who. However, producer Philip Segal later suggested Enemy Within as an alternative title. Lacking any other specific name, many fans have adopted this to refer to the movie. Fan groups have also used other informal titles. The DVD release is titled Doctor Who: The Movie.

Ninth Doctor
In 2005, the BBC relaunched Doctor Who after a 16-year absence from episodic television, with Russell T. Davies, Julie Gardner and Mal Young as executive producers, Phil Collinson as producer, and Christopher Eccleston taking the lead role of the Ninth Doctor. Although the production team chose to restart the series numbering from scratch, some fans of the programme prefer to refer to the 2005 series as Season 27, the 2006 series as Season 28, and so on. Despite the new numbering, the revival adheres to the original continuity. The new series is formatted to a 16:9 widescreen display ratio, and a standard episode length of 45 minutes. For the first time since the 1965&lt;U+2013&gt;'66 season, each episode has an individual title even though some stories span several episodes.
Series 1 (2005)
The 2005 series constitutes a loose story arc, dealing with the consequences of the Time War and the mysterious Bad Wolf.

Series 4 (2008) and beyond 

David Tennant is confirmed to star through to 2009. However, during the latter half of 2008, Tennant is committed to a Royal Shakespeare Company production of Hamlet. After the 2008 Christmas Special, three Bank Holiday specials have been commissioned to air throughout 2009.56 The programme will then return in 2010 with a fifth full series. Russell T Davies has suggested that the programme is expected to follow this pattern, of full series interspersed with occasional year-long breaks, for some time into the future.7
The Doctor will have three companions in the fourth series: Catherine Tate will reprise her role as Donna Noble, who was first introduced in &quot;The Runaway Bride&quot;, for all 13 episodes;8 Freema Agyeman (Martha) will return mid-season for five episodes,9 and Billie Piper will return as Rose Tyler for three episodes.10 Agyeman will also appear in three episodes of Torchwood.11
In the Doctor Who Confidential episode for &quot;The Sound Of Drums&quot;, Davies stated that it had always been his intention to bring back classic icons of Doctor Who one step at a time: Daleks in series 1, Cybermen in series 2, and the Master in series 3. He has also stated that he is not finished and will continue reviving villains from the original series.12
Guest stars
Kylie Minogue will guest star as Astrid Peth, a waitress aboard the Titanic, in the Christmas Special &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot;, set to air on 25 December 2007.13 Bernard Cribbins, who played companion Tom Campbell in the 1966 film Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD, will also star in this episode.14
The Doctor and Donna Noble will meet Agatha Christie who will be played by Fenella Woolgar in an episode set in the 1920s,15 where she will be supported by Felicity Kendal, who will play the part of Lady Clemency Eddison. Other actors featuring in the Agatha Christie episode include Felicity Jones, Christopher Benjamin, Tom Goodman-Hill, Ian Barritt, David Quilter, Adam Rayner, Daniel King and Charlotte Eaton.
The Doctor and Donna will also visit Pompeii in AD 79, on the eve of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Guest stars featuring in this episode include Peter Capaldi playing Caecilius, Phil Davis as Lucius and Tracey Childs as Metella. This episode featured one week of filming at the Cinecitt&lt;U+00E0&gt; studio in Rome.16
Further guest stars include Sarah Lancashire as Miss Foster, an &quot;enigmatic and powerful businesswoman&quot;, in the opening episode17, Tim McInnerny in &quot;Planet of the Ood&quot;1819, and Christopher Ryan as a Sontaran general in a story which will feature the return of Freema Agyeman as Martha Jones202122. Howard Attfield was set to reprise his role as Donna's father. However, Attfield died in late 2007, mid-way through shooting the series.23
Production
Writers for series four have also been announced: Gareth Roberts, Stephen Greenhorn, Tom MacRae, James Moran and Keith Temple will each write one episode. Moran co-wrote the 2006 horror film Severance, while Temple has written episodes of Byker Grove and Casualty. Helen Raynor and Steven Moffat will write two episodes each, and head writer Russell T. Davies will write four episodes. The episode written by Temple, &quot;Planet of the Ood&quot;, will feature the Ood - who previously appeared in Series 2 two-parter, &quot;The Impossible Planet&quot; / &quot;The Satan Pit&quot; - on their home planet.24 The name of Roberts' episode has been revealed via an acronym as &quot;TUATW&quot;.25
Some information regarding directors and the production blocks they will be directing has been announced:26

A further two episodes will be directed by Graeme Harper. Euros Lyn is also directing an unknown number of episodes. Susie Liggat will be producing four episodes (Block 2 and Block 5), as she did in Series 3 with &quot;Human Nature&quot;/&quot;The Family of Blood&quot;. Phil Collinson will receive an executive producer credit for these episodes.35
Fire on the set
In August 2007, media reported that filming for a Roman-themed Doctor Who episode had been interrupted by a fire in Rome's Cinecitt&lt;U+00E0&gt;, on sets previously used for the filming of the HBO/BBC TV series Rome.36 It was subsequently confirmed that the Rome sets at Cinecitt&lt;U+00E0&gt; had been used for the episode, which will be set in Pompeii in AD 79 on the eve of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.37 However, director Colin Teague said that the fire did not reach the parts of the sets which the Doctor Who team wanted to use.38
Other stories
TV broadcasts
There have also been several special Doctor Who episodes and serials that are produced by the BBC, but are not generally considered part of the series continuity. They usually consist of spoofs and crossovers with other TV shows, and stories produced for special occasions.

&quot;A Fix with Sontarans&quot; (1985) - segment of Jim'll Fix It starring Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor and Janet Fielding as Tegan Jovanka.
Dimensions in Time (1993) - Children in Need 30th anniversary program for Doctor Who and also crossover with EastEnders, starring Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy, with many companions returning.
Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death (1999) - Comic Relief spoof, starring Rowan Atkinson.

Webcasts

Death Comes to Time (2001) - webcast for BBCi featuring the Seventh Doctor.
Real Time (2002) - webcast for BBCi featuring the Sixth Doctor.
Shada (2003) - webcast for BBCi featuring the Eighth Doctor; remake of the unfinished Fourth Doctor serial.
Scream of the Shalka (2003) - Animated webcast for BBCi featuring an alternative version of the Ninth Doctor known as the Shalka Doctor, played by Richard E. Grant.

Some of the webcast productions were produced by Big Finish Productions but first aired on the BBC's website before release in other media; none were live-action productions, but instead used limited animation and illustrations, with Scream of the Shalka being more fully animated than the others.
The BBC has also commissioned and broadcast several radio serials based upon the series (see Doctor Who audio productions), most recently a series of productions for BBC7 starring Paul McGann.
Notes


Webber's script for the originally intended opening episode for the first story The Giants was a basis for the opening episode, but Webber didn't work with Coburn on the script.
From this point on, the stories (not the episodes) all have on-screen serial titles. For the 2005 revival, episode titles are used, even for most multi-episode tales, although the majority of stories are told in a single episode.
The Three Doctors was a tenth anniversary serial.
The first episode lists the serial's name as simply Invasion, ostensibly to conceal the surprise ending to that episode.
Shada was left unfinished due to a strike. Its recorded footage was later released on home video using linking narration by Tom Baker to complete the story.
The Five Doctors is considered part of the 20th season, although it was broadcast only a few weeks before the start of Season 21. The Five Doctors was re-edited into four 25-minute episodes for syndication, but the 90-minute special remained more frequently shown, until it was supplanted by 1995's &quot;Special Edition&quot; re-edit, c. 2000.
&quot;TVM&quot; is used in the BBC's online episode guide.39 The actual code used during production is 50/LDX071Y/01X.40 Doctor Who Magazine's &quot;Complete Eighth Doctor Special&quot; gives the production code as #83705.41 Big Finish Productions uses the code 8A, and numbers its subsequent Eighth Doctor stories correspondingly.
