History


 FK Partizan was founded on 4 October 1945, as a football section of the Yugoslav Sports Association Partizan,14 and was named in honor of the Yugoslav Partisans, the communist military formation who fought during World War II.15 The club was formed and initially managed by a group of high officers of the Yugoslav People's Army.16 Among them were Svetozar Vukmanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, Peko Dap&lt;U+010D&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;, Ratko Vujovi&lt;U+0107&gt; and Ko&lt;U+010D&gt;a Popovi&lt;U+0107&gt;.17 Partizan joined the newly-formed Yugoslav First League along with the Cup, and had a successful start, already winning the double in their debut season in 1946&lt;U+2013&gt;47.18 A second championship title followed in 1949.19 Until then, Partizan played its home games on the old BSK stadium, when its own stadium was built on the same site and named JNA Stadium.20 In 1950, the club evolved from a football section of the Army into an independent club under the umbrella organization JSD Partizan.21 The club's first president became Ratko Vujovi&lt;U+0107&gt;.22 In 1953, the remaining formal connections between Partizan and the JNA finally ceased.23 During the 1950s, the club had a long break without winning a championship, winning only cup titles in 1952, 1954 and 1957.24 On 4 September 1955, Partizan participated in the first ever Champions Cup match, in Lisbon against Portuguese club Sporting.25
After 12 years of playing in blue-red kits, the club adopted black and white colors in 1957, and official crest changes its colours a year later.2627 This change of the club's image and appearance was followed by changes in its squad. The number of young players, products of Partizan's youth school and known as Partizanove bebe (Partizan's babies), soon emerged into one of the best generations of footballers that Partizan ever had.28 Managers Ill&lt;U+00E9&gt;s Spitz, Florijan Matekalo and Stjepan Bobek monitored and guided their development. The decision to rely mostly on talented youngsters scouted from all over the country quickly produced results as Partizan captured three consecutive championship titles, in 1961,29 1962 and 1963,3031 the first title hat-trick in the history of the Yugoslav league.32 In 1965, the team won its fourth league title in five years,33 being interrupted in 1964 by Red Star Belgrade, whom Partizan developed a rivalry with in the 1960s.34 The 1965&lt;U+2013&gt;66 European Cup campaign was the crown of this generation's achievements.35 After defeating the English side Manchester United 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 on aggregate, FK Partizan, led by manager Abdulah Gegi&lt;U+0107&gt;, achieved the greatest success in the history of the club by playing in the 1966 European Cup Final against Real Madrid from Spain.36 By participating in this match, Partizan became the first club from the Balkans and Eastern Europe to reach a European Cup final.66 European Cup Final&quot;/&gt; The match was played on 11 May 1966 in the Heysel Stadium in Brussels.37 Partizan led by one goal until the 70th minute, but lost to the Spaniards 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 in the end.38 After the finals, Partizan fell into a crisis that lasted for several years.39
In 1976, Partizan won its seventh championship trophy, after a decade-long hiatus.40 An eighth title followed in 1978.41 That same year, led by manager Ante Mladini&lt;U+0107&gt;, Partizan won its first European trophy, the Mitropa Cup, defeating Hungarian side FC Honv&lt;U+00E9&gt;d in the finals with a score of 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0.42 The next season turned out to be the worst in Partizan's history, with the club finishing 15th in the league, barely avoiding relegation with a 4&lt;U+2013&gt;2 victory against Budu&lt;U+0107&gt;nost Podgorica in its last fixture.43 Subsequently, in the 1979&lt;U+2013&gt;80 season, Partizan finished 13th in the league.44 In the following two seasons, Partizan progressed on the table by finishing in 8th and 6th place.4546  Partizan became Yugoslav league-champion in 1983,47 in large part due to the performances of the young Dragan Mance.48 He helped Partizan win the league by scoring 15 goals, and immediately became a fan favourite.49 He also led the club in their 1984&lt;U+2013&gt;85 UEFA Cup second round tie against Queens Park Rangers. The English club won the first leg 6&lt;U+2013&gt;2, but Partizan advanced after a 4&lt;U+2013&gt;0 return victory. A goal which Mance scored against in that fixture is considered to be one of the most remarkable goals in the history of FK Partizan.50 That match in which Mance scored was voted 70th of the 100 greatest matches in the history of football, in a poll organized by Eurosport in 2009.51 On 3 September 1985, Mance died in an automobile accident on the Novi Sad-Belgrade highway. He was only 22 years old, and at the peak of his popularity.52 Even today, Mance is considered to be the one of the greatest players to have ever played for Partizan by the fans of the club.53 In his honour, the street next to Partizan's stadium in Belgrade carries his name.54
In 1986, Partizan won its 10th championship title with a 4&lt;U+2013&gt;0 win over &lt;U+017D&gt;eljezni&lt;U+010D&gt;ar, due to a better goal difference than second-placed rivals Red Star Belgrade.55 However, the Football Association of Yugoslavia ruled that the entire last round of fixtures had to be replayed after accusations that certain results had been fixed. Partizan refused to replay its match, after which the game was awarded 3&lt;U+2013&gt;0 to &lt;U+017D&gt;eljezni&lt;U+010D&gt;ar, and the title was given to Red Star Belgrade. After a sequence of appeals and lawsuits which eventually led to the Yugoslav Constitutional Court, the original final table of the 1985&lt;U+2013&gt;86 season, with Partizan as champions, was officially recognized in 1987. Also, the points deduction from 1986&lt;U+2013&gt;87 season was annulled, and the title was given to Partizan, who headed the table without the deduction.56
During Yugoslavia's final years, Partizan underwent significant organizational changes. In 1989, former goalkeeper Ivan &lt;U+0106&gt;urkovi&lt;U+0107&gt; became club president while Mirko Marjanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; became the president of Partizan's executive board. The club only won the 1989 national cup, 32 years after its last victory in that competition.57 The last trophy which the club won before the breakup of Yugoslavia was the 1989 Yugoslav Super Cup, the first and the only one that was organized.
After the collapse of Yugoslavia, a new country was formed and named FR Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro. In new circumstances, Partizan won two titles in a row, in 1993 and 1994. Next three championships, Partizan won in 1996, 1997 and 1999. The club also won three national cups in 1992, 1994 and 1998.58 The key man for all these trophies was manager Ljubi&lt;U+0161&gt;a Tumbakovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, who became the most successful manager in the history of the club.59 For the season 1996&lt;U+2013&gt;1997, Partizan was reintroduced to European competition following UEFA's lifting of its ban on clubs from Yugoslavia, but while the national team continued where they had stopped in the spring of 1992,60 the clubs had all their results erased and were treated as beginners in European competitions. Instead of enjoying the merits of their own many-year work, they would get harder opponents from the start and the competition would begin already in July.61
Tumbakovi&lt;U+0107&gt; guided Partizan to another cup win in 2001, and the championship trophy in 2002.62 His successor, Lothar Matth&lt;U+00E4&gt;us, led the club to its first UEFA Champions League participation after eliminating Newcastle United in qualification,63 and the championship victory in 2003.64 However, playing in Europe reflected in the championship race and Partizan lost the title.65 New coach Vladimir Vermezovi&lt;U+0107&gt; won the championship in 2005, and managed to take the team to the round-of-16 of the 2004&lt;U+2013&gt;05 UEFA Cup.66 Later on, Partizan was eliminated by CSKA Moscow, the eventual winners of the competition.67 Next season, after being eliminated early from European competition, Vermezovi&lt;U+0107&gt; resigned in 2006.
Three years after Matth&lt;U+00E4&gt;us, Partizan signed another German coach, J&lt;U+00FC&gt;rgen R&lt;U+00F6&gt;ber.68 He left the club after a few months due to poor results in domestic competitions. Afterwards, the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro separated, and the newly founded Serbian SuperLiga was established in August 2006. The club appointed Miodrag Je&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt; for the second time.69 Under him, Partizan finished 2nd in the SuperLiga and managed to qualify for the 2006&lt;U+2013&gt;07 UEFA Cup group stage.70 Later on Je&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt; was sacked and replaced by Miroslav &lt;U+0110&gt;uki&lt;U+0107&gt;.71  In January 2008, former Partizan player Slavi&lt;U+0161&gt;a Jokanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; was appointed as the club's new head coach.72 The seasons 2007&lt;U+2013&gt;08 and 2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09 were one of the most successful in the club's history.7374 In 2009, Partizan defended their double from the 2007&lt;U+2013&gt;08 season for the first time in club history. In Europe, UEFA expelled Partizan from the UEFA Cup due to crowd trouble at their away qualifying match in Mostar.75 In the next two seasons, after relegations from the Champions League, Partizan qualified two times in a row for the second most prestigious European club football tournament. The club played in the 2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09 UEFA Cup and 2009&lt;U+2013&gt;10 UEFA Europa League.7677
Under new manager Aleksandar Stanojevi&lt;U+0107&gt;,78 Partizan won the championship in 2010 and the double in 2011.7980 In UEFA competitions, Partizan qualified for the 2010&lt;U+2013&gt;11 UEFA Champions League after beating Belgian side RSC Anderlecht.81 In the following season, Partizan failed to qualify neither for Champions League nor Europa League and after the half-season, Stanojevi&lt;U+0107&gt; was released.82 Partizan then signed former Chelsea manager Avram Grant,83 who won a fifth consecutive league title.84 Grant resigned after five months and former Partizan manager Vladimir Vermezovi&lt;U+0107&gt; returned to Belgrade in May 2012.85 Under his guidance, Partizan qualified for the 2012&lt;U+2013&gt;13 UEFA Europa League group stage.86Because of poor results in the second part of national championship, Vermezovi&lt;U+0107&gt; was dismissed and replaced by Vuk Ra&lt;U+0161&gt;ovi&lt;U+0107&gt;. Following the victory in the eternal derby and in pre-last round, Ra&lt;U+0161&gt;ovi&lt;U+0107&gt; secured a sixth consecutive title, a total of 25th in history of the club.87 As a champion of the Serbian SuperLiga for 2012&lt;U+2013&gt;13 season, Partizan managed to equalize a national record by the number of championship titles won.ampion!

Crest and colours

 In October 1945, Partizan adopted as their first crest a blue circle with a yellow bordered red five-pointed star in the middle, which symbolized communism,88 and contained the abbreviation JA &lt;U+2013&gt; Jugoslovenska Armija (the Yugoslav Army) inside it. Later on, the central circle became white with a red five-pointed star in it. It was surrounded by a larger blue circle in which the words &quot;the Yugoslav Army&quot; were written, while both circles were bordered by a yellow circle with a green wreath over it. At the bottom of the emblem was a shield with red and white lines, and on the top were five torches, each representing one of the five nations of Yugoslavia (Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, Macedonians and Montenegrins). This was a clear reference to the National Emblem of Yugoslavia.89
In the early 1950s, Partizan was separated from the Yugoslav Army and for the first time the team's name was written in the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. The inscription of the Yugoslav Army was removed from the crest, along with the green wreath, and was replaced by the words Sportsko Dru&lt;U+0161&gt;tvo (Sports association). Partizan used this emblem until 1958, although it changed its equipment colors of blue and red to black and white a year before. The crest was also changed to be completely black and white, and Sportsko Dru&lt;U+0161&gt;tvo was amended into Jugoslovensko Sportsko Dru&lt;U+0161&gt;tvo (Yugoslav Sports Association), while the five red torches and the five-pointed star remained.90 It was slightly redesigned after 1963 by adding a sixth torch to reflect the change of the official state emblem, which now included six torches representing six Yugoslav republics,91 instead of the previous five representing the nations. The crest remained unchanged until the breakup of Yugoslavia.

When Yugoslavia ceased to exist in 1992, instead of Jugoslovensko Sportsko Dru&lt;U+0161&gt;tvo, the word Fudbalski klub (Football Club) were inserted and this crest was left to this day. The author of the crest was academic painter Branko &lt;U+0160&gt;otra.92 In the 2007&lt;U+2013&gt;08 season, Partizan won its 20th national championship and added two stars above their crest, symbolizing the twenty gained titles.9394 However, there is an alternative crest, which Partizan supporters call it the &quot;shovel&quot; but it's never used in official matches.95  For most of its history, Partizan has played in black and white striped jerseys, but during its earliest days it used entirely Maroon (color)#Dark red{{!}}dark red, blue or white jerseys.96 In 1950, Partizan briefly had an all white shirt with a blue diagonal stripe, besides an all blue shirt.97 From 1952, the first red-blue striped and quartered jerseys appeared.98 In 1957, the club was on tour in South America and after a friendly game with Juventus F.C., a president of the Italian club Umberto Agnelli, donated them a two sets of black and white jerseys.99 Since then, Partizan has played mainly in black and white striped shirts,100 with black or white shorts and socks.101 But there were exceptions, like in 1974, when they wore a black and white hooped shirt, and 1982, when they have played in a plain white jerseys with a thick black stripe across them.102 In 1990, the red and blue jersey returned after more than 30 years, in an away match against Hibernians F.C. during the UEFA Cup campaign. All this time, the away shirts have been mostly either all white or occasionally red-blue striped, but in recent years an all black strip is usually used.103
Stadium and training ground

 Designed by architect Mika Jankovi&lt;U+0107&gt;,104 the Partizan stadium was built in 1949 on the site of BSK Stadium, today situated in the Savski venac municipality, in central Belgrade, and was the former home ground of BSK Belgrade, now OFK Belgrade.105 It was officially opened on Yugoslav People's Army Day on 22 December 1951.106 The first match played at the venue was Yugoslavia against France on 9 October 1949.107 The stadium then already had its present shape, but could still hold 55,000 spectators as it mainly consisted of terraces.108 It was extensively renovated in 1998 following UEFA security regulations.109 This also led to the conversion of the stadium into an all-seater reducing the capacity to 32,710,110 currently the second largest stadium in Serbia behind the Red Star Stadium.111
The club's stadium is now named Partizan Stadium, although it was known as JNA Stadium (Stadion Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija, Stadium of the Yugoslav People's Army) for most of its history, and even today, a lot of football fans in all countries of the former-Yugoslavia call it by its old name. Partizan fans sometimes call it &quot;Fudbalski Hram&quot; (The Temple of Football).112
The stadium has also been used for a variety of other sport events since 1949. It was used from the mid-fifties until 1987 as the final point of yearly festivities called the Youth Day.113 Also, it was the host of the 1962 European Athletics Championships, a place for various concerts and it hosted many times the Yugoslav Cup and Serbian Cup final.114115 Partizan's players train at the Partizan sport complex, named SC Partizan-Teleoptik, which is located in the Zemun municipality in north Belgrade, a modern purpose-built facility which was completely renovated in 2004.116 This sport complex is the training base of all Partizan selections, from senior down to the youngest categories.117 Also, it is the home field of Partizan's affiliate Teleoptik Zemun.118

The Partizan youth school, called Youth School Belin &lt;U+2013&gt; Lazarevi&lt;U+0107&gt; &lt;U+2013&gt; Nadoveza, was founded in the 1950s and named after former Partizan players Bruno Belin, &lt;U+010C&gt;edomir Lazarevi&lt;U+0107&gt; and Branko Nadoveza.119 The club is well known for its dedicated work with youngsters.120 Its training philosophy is not only the development of football players, but also to care of their growing and personality forming, while also teaching the sporting spirit.121 There are around 400 youngsters classifiyed by age categories.122 There are six selections, four compete at the level of the Football Association of Serbia, the U17, U16, U15 and U14, while the U13 and U12 compete at the level of the Football Association of Belgrade.123 The ones that still didn&lt;U+00B4&gt;t reach the U12 level do not participate in official competitions, but do play in tournaments and friendly matches.124
Partizan is the club with most league titles and cup wins in youth competition in Serbia.125 The youth teams also participate in numerous tournaments around Europe and also organize an U17 international tournament with participation of some of the top European clubs.126 Partizan organizes also football camps for children in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Australia127128 and United States.129130 Many of the best youth academy players move directly to the Partizan senior side, or to the affiliate club Teleoptik Zemun.131
All of Partizan's youth categories train at the Partizan sport complex named SC Partizan-Teleoptik along with Partizan's seniors and the players of Teleoptik.132 For its youth work, Partizan has won several awards, including &quot;Best European Youth Work&quot; in 2006,133 and the club's youth school has been declared the second-best in Europe after that of Ajax Amsterdam.134 Partizan's academy has produced numerous professional football players or Yugoslav and Serbian internationals. Notable players from the recent past are Simon Vuk&lt;U+010D&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;, Nikola Gulan, Ivan Obradovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, Miralem Sulejmani, Adem Ljaji&lt;U+0107&gt;, Stevan Joveti&lt;U+0107&gt; and Matija Nastasi&lt;U+0107&gt;.
Supporters

 According to a domestic poll, Partizan is the second most popular football club in Serbia,ernje novosti&quot;/&gt; behind Red Star Belgrade and one of the most popular football clubs in Southeast Europe. The club has a large fanbase in Montenegro,135 Bosnia and Herzegovina (especially in the Bosnian Serb entity of Republika Srpska),136 and Croatia. They also have many supporters in all other former-Yugoslav republics like Macedonia,137 Slovenia,138 and in the Serbian diaspora, especially in Germany,139 Austria,140 Switzerland,141 Sweden,142 Canada, United States and Australia.
The organized supporters of Partizan are called Grobari (The Gravediggers or Undertakers),143 which were formed in 1970 and situated mainly on the south stand of the Partizan Stadium, therefore they are also known as Grobari Jug (The Undertakers South).144 Even some ordinary Partizan fans often refer to themselves as Grobari. The nickname itself was given by their sporting rivals Delije (The Heroes) of Red Star Belgrade, referring to the club's mostly black colors which were similar to the official uniforms of cemetery undertakers.145 The other theory is that the name comes from a misinterpretation of the name of the street on which Partizan's stadium is located &lt;U+2013&gt; Humska (humka roughly translates as grave or entombment),146 when actually the street was named after Serbian medieval land of Hum, nowadays part of Herzegovina and South Dalmatia. The Grobari support all clubs in the Partizan Sports Association and in the course of time they have become recognizable by their noisy and constant cheering as well as their devotion and loyalty to the club.147 The basis of their cheering is referred in the Serbian fan scene as the principle of &lt;U+201E&gt;srce, ruke, glas&lt;U+201D&gt; (heart, hands, voice) or &lt;U+201E&gt;glas i dlan&lt;U+201D&gt; (voice and palms),s Grobari&quot;/&gt; along with songs in distinctive style.s Grobari&quot;/&gt; The Grobari as a whole maintain a close friendship with the organized supporters of PAOK Thessaloniki, CSKA Sofia and CSKA Moscow,148149 which started originally because of the two supporters' common Orthodox faith and similar founding backgrounds.
Rivalries

Partizan's biggest rival is with Red Star Belgrade. The matches between these rivals have been labeled as the Eternal derby (Serbian: &lt;U+0412&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0447&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0442&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt; &lt;U+0434&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0431&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;, Ve&lt;U+010D&gt;iti derbi). The rivalry started immediately after the creation of the two clubs. Red Star was founded with close ties to the Yugoslav Ministry of the Interior and Partizan as the football section of the Yugoslav People's Army. Since then, both clubs have dominated domestic football. The rivalry is also intensified by the fact that both clubs have their stadiums situated only a few hundred meters apart. The eternal derby is particularly noted for the passion of both supporters groups. The stands of both teams feature fireworks, coloured confetti, flags, rolls of paper, torches, smoke, drums, giant posters and choreographies, used to create visual grandeur and apply psychological pressure on the visiting teams, hence the slogan &quot;Welcome to Hellgrade&quot;.150 Some fans use sometimes also trumpets, similar to the supporters in South America. This creates for the region a typical and distinctive Balkan Brass Band atmosphere. Both sets of supporters sing passionate songs against their rivals, and the stadiums are known to bounce with the simultaneous jumping of the fans. The duel is regarded by the Bleacher Report as one of the greatest football rivalries in the world.151 Given its widespread touch on the entirety of a major city, it's dubbed one of, along with the Old Firm, the Rome derby and the Istanbul derby, the most heated rivalries in European football.152 In 2009, the Daily Mail ranked the Eternal Derby 4th among the 10 greatest football rivalries of all time.153 The largest attendance at a derby match was about 100,000 spectators (90,142 with paid tickets) on 7 November 1976 at the Red Star Stadium.154 The biggest win was 7&lt;U+2013&gt;1 for Partizan on 6 December 1953 at the Partizan Stadium.iti derbi&quot;/&gt;155
