He ruled during the protracted war between the Byzantine Empire and the First Bulgarian Empire. His close relationship with Byzantium did not save Duklja from the expansionist Tsar Samuel of Bulgaria, who conquered the principality in around 1010 and took Jovan Vladimir prisoner. A medieval chronicle asserts that Samuel's daughter, Theodora Kosara, fell in love with Vladimir and begged her father for his hand. The tsar allowed the marriage and returned Duklja to Vladimir, who ruled as his vassal.
Vladimir was acknowledged as a pious, just, and peaceful ruler. He took no part in his father-in-law's war efforts. The warfare culminated with Samuel's defeat by the Byzantines in 1014; the tsar died soon afterward. In 1016 Vladimir fell victim to a plot by Ivan Vladislav, the last ruler of the First Bulgarian Empire. He was beheaded in front of a church in Prespa, the empire's capital, and was buried there. He was soon recognized as a martyr and saint; his feast day is celebrated on 22 May.{{#tag:ref|Some Orthodox Churches use the Julian calendar rather than the Gregorian used in the West.

In 1381 his remains were preserved in the Church of Saint Jovan Vladimir near Elbasan, and since 1995 they have been kept in the Orthodox cathedral of Tirana, Albania. The saint's remains are considered relics, and attract many believers, especially on his feast day, when the relics are taken to the church near Elbasan for a celebration.
The cross Vladimir held when he was beheaded is also regarded as a relic. Traditionally under the care of the Androvi&lt;U+0107&gt; family from the village of Velji Mikuli&lt;U+0107&gt;i in southeastern Montenegro, the cross is only shown to believers on the Feast of Pentecost, when it is carried in a procession to the summit of Mount Rumija. Jovan Vladimir is regarded as the first Serbian saint and the patron saint of the town of Bar in Montenegro. His earliest, lost hagiography was probably written sometime between 1075 and 1089; a shortened version, written in Latin, is preserved in the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja. His hagiography in Greek, composed from oral traditions, was first published in 1690, and a translation into Church Slavonic was published, with some corrections, in 1802. The saint is classically depicted on icons as a monarch wearing a crown and regal clothes, with a cross in his right hand and his own head in his left hand. He is fabled to have carried his severed head to his place of burial.
Life
 Duklja was an early medieval Serbian principality whose borders coincided for the most part with present-day Montenegro.2 The state rose greatly in power after the disintegration of Serbia that followed the death of its ruler, Prince &lt;U+010C&gt;aslav, in around 943. Though the extent of &lt;U+010C&gt;aslav's Serbia is uncertain, it is known that it included Ra&lt;U+0161&gt;ka (now part of Central Serbia) and Bosnia. Ra&lt;U+0161&gt;ka had subsequently come under Duklja's political dominance, along with the neighboring Serbian principalities of Travunia and Zachlumia (in present-day Herzegovina and south Dalmatia).34 Byzantines often referred to Duklja as Serbia.5
Around 1000, Vladimir, still a boy, succeeded his father Petrislav as the ruler of Duklja.6 Petrislav is regarded as the earliest ruler of Duklja whose existence can be confirmed by primary historical sources, which also indicate that he was in close relations with Byzantium.78 The principality consisted of two provinces: Zenta in the south and Podgoria in the north. A local tradition has it that Vladimir's court was situated on the hillock called Kralji&lt;U+010D&gt;, at the village of Ko&lt;U+0161&gt;tanjica near Lake Skadar, in the Krajina region of southeastern Montenegro.910 Near Kralji&lt;U+010D&gt; lie the ruins of the Pre&lt;U+010D&gt;ista Krajinska Church (dedicated to Theotokos), which already existed in Vladimir's time.11
Vladimir's reign is recounted in Chapter 36 of the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, completed between 1299 and 1301;12 Chapters 34 and 35 deal with his father and uncles. These three chapters of the chronicle are most likely based on a lost biography of Vladimir written in Duklja sometime between 1075 and 1089.1314 Both the chronicle and the 11th-century Byzantine historian John Skylitzes described Vladimir as a wise, pious, just, and peaceful ruler.1516
Vladimir's reign coincided with a protracted war between the Byzantine Emperor Basil II (r. 976&lt;U+2013&gt;1025) and the ruler of the First Bulgarian Empire, Tsar Samuel (r. 980&lt;U+2013&gt;1014). Basil II might have sought the support of other Balkan rulers for his fight against Samuel, and he intensified diplomatic contacts with Duklja for this purpose. A Serbian diplomatic mission, most likely sent from Duklja, arrived in the Byzantine capital of Constantinople in 992 and was recorded in a charter of the Great Lavra Monastery, written in 993.17
In 1004 or 1005, Emperor Basil recovered from Samuel the city of Dyrrhachium,18 the major stronghold on the Adriatic coast,19 south of Duklja. Since 1005, Basil had also controlled the coastal lands north and south of that city,20 parts of the Byzantine Theme of Dyrrhachium.21 Byzantium thus established a territorial contact with Prince Vladimir's Duklja, which was in turn connected to the Byzantine Theme of Dalmatia, consisting of Adriatic towns northwest of Duklja. The Republic of Venice, an ally of Byzantium, militarily intervened in Dalmatia in 1000 to protect the towns from attacks by Croats and Narentines. Venetian rule over Dalmatia on behalf of Basil was confirmed by the emperor in 1004 or 1005. Svetislav Surinja, a Venetian ally, was crowned Croatian king. Venice, the Dalmatian towns, Croatia, and Vladimir's Duklja, were thus aligned in a compact pro-Byzantine bloc connected to Byzantium via Dyrrhachium.22
 The close relations with Byzantium, however, did not help Prince Vladimir. Samuel attacked Duklja in 1009 or 1010, as part of his campaign aimed at breaking up that pro-Byzantine bloc, which could pose a threat to him.23 Vladimir retreated with his army and many of his people to his fortress on a hill named Oblik, close to the southeastern tip of Lake Skadar.24 According to the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, he performed a miracle there: the hill was infested with venomous snakes, but when he offered up a prayer to the Lord, their bites became harmless.25
Part of Samuel's army lay siege to the hill, and the remainder attacked the nearby coastal town of Ulcinj, which was part of the fortification system of the Theme of Dyrrhachium. Vladimir eventually surrendered, a decision the chronicle attributed to his wish to deliver his people from famine and the sword. He was sent to a prison in Samuel's capital of Prespa, located in western Macedonia.26 Having failed to conquer Ulcinj, which received men and supplies by sea from Dalmatian towns, the tsar directed his forces toward Dalmatia. There he burned the towns of Kotor and Dubrovnik, and ravaged the region as far northwest as Zadar. He then returned to Bulgaria via Bosnia and Ra&lt;U+0161&gt;ka.27 A consequence of this campaign was the Bulgarian occupation of Duklja, Travunia, Zachlumia, Bosnia, and Ra&lt;U+0161&gt;ka.28 Venetian, and indirectly Byzantine power in Dalmatia was weakened. Samuel succeeded to break up the pro-Byzantine bloc.29
The chronicle states that while Vladimir languished in the Prespa prison, praying day and night, an angel of the Lord appeared to him and foretold that he would shortly be freed, but that he would die a martyr's death. His fate in captivity was described in a romantic story involving him and Theodora Kosara, Tsar Samuel's daughter. This is the chronicle's description of how they met:30

It came to pass that Samuel's daughter, Cossara, was animated and inspired by a beatific soul. She approached her father and begged that she might go down with her maids and wash the head and feet of the chained captives. Her father granted her wish, so she descended and carried out her good work. Noticing Vladimir among the prisoners, she was struck by his handsome appearance, his humility, gentleness and modesty, and the fact that he was full of wisdom and knowledge of the Lord. She stopped to talk to him, and to her his speech seemed sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.

Kosara then begged her father for Vladimir's hand, and the tsar granted her request. He restored his new son-in-law to the throne of Duklja.3132 In reality, the marriage was probably a result of Samuel's political assessment: he may have decided that Vladimir would be a more loyal vassal if he was married to his daughter.33 Resolving thus the question of Duklja, Samuel could concentrate more troops in Macedonia and Thessaly, the main site of his conflict with Byzantium. The chronicle claims that the tsar also gave Vladimir the whole territory of Dyrrachium. The prince could in fact have been given a northern part of that territory, which was partially under Samuel's rule. A brief note on Vladimir by John Skylitzes may indicate that the prince also received some territory in Ra&lt;U+0161&gt;ka.3435 His paternal uncle Dragimir, ruler of Travunia and Zachlumia, who had retreated before Samuel's army, was given back his lands to rule, also as the tsar's vassal.3637
Thereafter, as recorded in the chronicle, &quot;Vladimir lived with his wife Cossara in all sanctity and chastity, worshipping God and serving him night and day, and he ruled the people entrusted to him in a Godfearing and just manner.&quot;38 There are no indications that Vladimir took any part in his father-in-law's war efforts.39 The warfare culminated with Samuel's disastrous defeat by the Byzantines in 1014, and in the same year, on 6 October, the tsar died of a heart attack.4041 He was succeeded by his son, Gavril Radomir, whose reign was short: his cousin Ivan Vladislav killed him in 1015 and ruled in his stead.42 Vladislav sent messengers to Vladimir demanding his attendance at the court in Prespa, but Kosara advised him not to go and went there herself instead. Vladislav received her with honor and urged Vladimir to come as well, sending him a golden cross as a token of safe conduct. The chronicle relates the prince's reply:43

We believe that our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, was suspended not on a golden cross, but on a wooden one. Therefore, if both your faith and your words are true, send me a wooden cross in the hands of religious men, then in accordance with the belief and conviction of the Lord Jesus Christ, I will have faith in the life-giving cross and holy wood. I will come.

Two bishops and a hermit came to Vladimir, gave him a wooden cross, and confirmed that the tsar had made a pledge of faith on it. Vladimir kissed the cross and clutched it to his chest, collected a few followers, and set off for Prespa. As he arrived, on 22 May 1016, he went into a church to pray. When he exited the church, he was struck down by Vladislav's soldiers and beheaded.4445 According to Skylitzes, Vladimir believed Vladislav's pledge, told to him by the Bulgarian archbishop David. He then allowed himself to fall into Vladislav's hands, and was executed.4647 The motivation behind the murder is unclear. Since Samuel's defeat in 1014, the Bulgarians had been losing battle after battle, and Vladislav probably suspected or was informed that Vladimir planned to restore Duklja's alliance with Byzantium.4849 This alliance would be particularly disturbing for Tsar Vladislav because of the proximity of Duklja to Dyrrhachium, which was a target of the tsar's war efforts.50
In early 1018 Vladislav led an unsuccessful attack against Dyrrhachium, outside whose walls he found his death.51 In the same year, the Byzantine army&lt;U+2014&gt;led by the victorious Emperor Basil&lt;U+2014&gt;terminated the First Bulgarian Empire.52 As Vladimir and Kosara had no children, his successor was his uncle Dragimir, ruler of Travunia and Zachlumia. Accompanied by soldiers, he set off for Duklja to establish himself as its ruler, probably in the first half of 1018. When he came to Kotor, the town's inhabitants ambushed and killed him after inviting him to a banquet, and his soldiers returned to Travunia.5354 Duklja was not mentioned again in the sources until the 1030s. Some scholars believe that it was placed under direct Byzantine rule around 1018, while others believe it remained a Byzantine vassal state under an unknown native ruler.55
Cult

Jovan Vladimir was buried in Prespa, in the same church in front of which he was martyred.56 His relics soon became famous as miraculously healing, attracting many people to his tomb. Shortly after his death he was recognized as a martyr and saint, being commemorated on 22 May.575859 At that time, saints were recognized without any formal rite of canonization.60 Vladimir was the first ruler of a Serbian state who was elevated to sainthood.61 The rulers from the House of Nemanji&lt;U+0107&gt;, who reigned over the Serbian state which grew around Ra&lt;U+0161&gt;ka, would almost all be canonized&lt;U+2014&gt;starting with Nemanja, the saintly founder of the dynasty.62
Several years after his burial, Kosara transported the remains to Duklja. She interred him in the Pre&lt;U+010D&gt;ista Krajinska Church, near his court, in the region of Krajina. The relics drew many devotees to the church, which became a center of pilgrimage. Kosara did not remarry; at her request, she was interred in Pre&lt;U+010D&gt;ista Krajinska, at the feet of her husband.6364 In around 1215&lt;U+2014&gt;when Krajina was under the rule of Serbian Grand Prince Stefan Nemanji&lt;U+0107&gt;&lt;U+2014&gt;the relics were presumably removed from this church and transported to Dyrrhachium by the troops of Michael I, the despot of Epirus. At that time Despot Michael had briefly captured from Serbia the city of Skadar, which is only about  east of the church. Jovan Vladimir was mentioned as the patron saint of Dyrrhachium in a Greek liturgical text.6566
In 1368 Dyrrhachium was taken from the Angevins by Karlo Thopia, an Albanian lord.67 In 1381 he rebuilt, in Byzantine style, a church ruined in an earthquake near the town of Elbasan, in the narrow valley of the stream Kusha, a tributary of the Shkumbin River. The church was dedicated to Saint Jovan Vladimir, as the inscription which Thopia placed above its south entrance declared in Greek, Latin, and Serbian. The saint's relics were kept in a reliquary, a wooden casket, which was enclosed in a shrine,  in height, within the church.68
Serbian scholar Stojan Novakovi&lt;U+0107&gt; theorized that Vladimir was buried near Elbasan immediately after his death. Novakovi&lt;U+0107&gt; conjectured that the earthquake which ruined the old church happened during Thopia's rule, and that Thopia reinstated the relics in the rebuilt church. If Vladimir was previously buried in Duklja, Novakovi&lt;U+0107&gt; reasoned, he would not be absent, as he was, from Serbian sources written during the reign of the Nemanji&lt;U+0107&gt; dynasty, who ruled over Duklja (later named Zeta) from 1186 to 1371. Novakovi&lt;U+0107&gt; did not consider the idea that the relics might have been removed from Duklja to Dyrrhachium in around 1215.69 He commented on the chronicle's account that Kosara transported Vladimir's body &quot;to a place known as Krajina, where his court was&quot;:70 While his court was possibly in the region of Krajina before his captivity, after he married Kosara it could have been near Elbasan, in the territory of Dyrrachium he received from Tsar Samuel. He was interred near the latter court, which was replaced in the chronicle with the former.71
An Orthodox monastery grew around the church near Elbasan, and became the see of the newly founded Archdiocese of Dyrrhachium in the 18th century.72 In more recent times the monastery fell into disrepair, and in the 1960s it was closed by the Communist authorities of Albania;73 in 1967 the reliquary with the saint's relics was moved to Saint Mary's Church in Elbasan.74 The dilapidated monastery was returned to the Church in the 1990s. The restoration of its church and other buildings was completed in 2005.7576 Since around 1995 the relics have been kept in the Orthodox cathedral of Tirana, the capital of Albania, and are brought back to the monastery only for the saint's feast day.7778
Each year on the Feast of Saint Jovan Vladimir, a great number of devotees come to the monastery,79 popularly known as Shingjon among Albanians. In the morning, the reliquary is placed at the center of the church under a canopy, before being opened. After the morning liturgy has been celebrated, chanting priests carry the reliquary three times around the church, followed by the devotees, who hold lit candles. The reliquary is then placed in front of the church, to be kissed by the believers. The priests give them pieces of cotton that have been kept inside the reliquary since the previous feast. There are numerous stories about people, both Christians and Muslims, who were healed after they prayed before the saint's relics.80
Saint Jovan Vladimir is the patron saint of the modern-day town of Bar in south Montenegro,81 built at its present location in 1976 about  from the site of the old town of Bar, which was destroyed in a war and abandoned in 1878.82 A religious procession celebrating the saint passes on his feast day through the town's streets with church banners and icons. The procession is usually led by the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitan of Montenegro and the Littoral.83 The bronze sculpture King Jovan Vladimir,  in height, was installed at the central square of Bar in 2001; it is a work by sculptor Nenad &lt;U+0160&gt;o&lt;U+0161&gt;ki&lt;U+0107&gt;.84 Although Vladimir was only a prince, he is referred to as &quot;king&quot; in the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja,85 as well as among people of southeastern Montenegro;86 hence the hillock thought to be the site of his court is named Kralji&lt;U+010D&gt; (kralj means &quot;king&quot;).87
Cross of Vladimir
 A cross, held by tradition to be the one that Jovan Vladimir received from Ivan Vladislav, and had in his hands when he was martyred, is a highly valued relic. It is under the care of the Androvi&lt;U+0107&gt; family from the village of Velji Mikuli&lt;U+0107&gt;i near Bar and, according to the Androvi&lt;U+0107&gt;s, has been for centuries. The cross is made of yew wood plated with silver, with a brass ball attached to its lower arm, into which a stick is inserted when the cross is carried. The cross is  high,  wide, and  thick.8889
According to Russian scholars Ivan Yastrebov and Pavel Rovinski, the cross was originally kept in the Pre&lt;U+010D&gt;ista Krajinska Church, in which Kosara had interred Vladimir.90 At the peak of Islamization of the Krajina region in the 18th century, the church was torn down and the cross was given to the people of the region. They believed that it could protect against evil and ensure a rich harvest, and kept it as sacred, although they had converted to Islam.91 Yastrebov and Rovinski relate that the cross was later taken from them by the neighboring clan of Mrkojevi&lt;U+0107&gt;i. When they too converted to Islam, they entrusted the cross to the Androvi&lt;U+0107&gt; family&lt;U+2014&gt;their Orthodox Christian neighbors.92
The cross, followed by a religious procession, is carried each year on the Feast of Pentecost from Velji Mikuli&lt;U+0107&gt;i to the summit of Mount Rumija. The procession is preceded by a midnight liturgy in the village's Church of Saint Nicholas. After the liturgy, the ascent begins up a steep path to the  summit of Rumija. The cross, carried by a member of the Androvi&lt;U+0107&gt; family, leads the procession, followed by an Orthodox priest and the other participants. Catholics and Muslims of the region have traditionally participated in the procession. It is carefully observed that no one precedes the cross; to do so is considered a bad omen. The ascending devotees sing:93



 Krste nosim, Boga molim, Gospodi pomiluj. 
 I carry the cross, I pray to God, Lord, have mercy. 




 In the past, the standard-bearer of the Mrkojevi&lt;U+0107&gt;i clan, a Muslim, walked next to the cross with a flag in his left and a knife in his right hand, ready to use it if anyone attempted to take the cross. The clan especially feared that the participants from Krajina might try to recover the sacred object. At the end of 19th century the number of Muslims in the procession dropped as their religious and political leaders disapproved of their participation in it.94 After World War II, Yugoslavia's socialist government discouraged public religious celebrations, and the procession was not held between 1959 and 1984.95
Tradition has it that a church dedicated to the Holy Trinity stood at the summit until it was razed by the Ottomans; in another version, the church crumbled after a boy and a girl sinned within. Before 2005, there was a custom to pick up a stone at a certain distance from the peak and carry it to the supposed site of the church in the belief that when a sufficient quantity of stones were collected, the church would rebuild itself.96 A new church dedicated to the Holy Trinity was consecrated on the site by the Serbian Orthodox Church on 31 July 2005.97
The procession arrives at the peak before dawn, and at sunrise the morning liturgy begins. After prayers have been offered, the procession goes back to Velji Mikuli&lt;U+0107&gt;i, again following the cross. The participants would formerly gather on a flat area  from the peak,98 where they would spend some five or six hours in a joyous celebration and sports, and have a communal meal.99 On the way back, some people pick the so-called herb of Rumija (Onosma visianii), whose root is reputed for its medicinal properties. The procession ends at the Church of Saint Nicholas, and folk festivities at Velji Mikuli&lt;U+0107&gt;i continue into the night. Until the next Feast of Pentecost, the cross is kept at a secret location. It was formerly known only to two oldest male members of the Androvi&lt;U+0107&gt; family,100 and since around 2000 the Androvi&lt;U+0107&gt;s have appointed a committee to keep the cross.101
Hagiography and iconography
The oldest preserved hagiography of Saint Jovan Vladimir is contained in Chapter 36 of the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja. This chronicle, written in Latin, was completed between 1299 and 1301 in the town of Bar, then part of the Serbian Kingdom. Its author was Rudger, the Catholic Archbishop of Bar, who was probably of Czech origin.102 He wrote Chapter 36 as a summary of an older hagiography of Vladimir, written in Duklja most likely sometime between 1075 and 1089. This is the period when Duklja's rulers from the House of Vojislavljevi&lt;U+0107&gt; endeavored to obtain the royal insignia from the Pope, and to elevate the Bar Bishopric to an archbishopric. They represented Prince Vladimir as the saintly founder of their dynasty;103 they were, according to the chronicle, descendants of his uncle Dragimir.104 The Vojislavljevi&lt;U+0107&gt;s succeeded in those endeavors, though Vladimir was not recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church.105 Despite its hagiographic nature, Chapter 36 contains a lot of reliable historical data.106 Chapters 34 and 35, which deal with Vladimir's father and uncles, are probably based on the prologue of the 11th-century hagiography.107 Chapters 1&lt;U+2013&gt;33 of the chronicle are based on oral traditions and its author's constructions, and are for the most part dismissed by historians.108109
 The hagiography in the chronicle is the source for the &quot;Poem of King Vladimir&quot; composed in the 18th century by a Franciscan monk from Dalmatia, Andrija Ka&lt;U+010D&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt; Mio&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt;. The poem is part of Mio&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt;'s history of the South Slavs in prose and verse, written in the Croatian vernacular of Dalmatia. This book was first printed in Venice in 1756 and was soon read beyond Dalmatia, including Serbia and Bulgaria (then under Ottoman rule, as was most of the Balkans). The &quot;Poem of King Vladimir&quot; is composed in a manner derived from the style of the South Slavic oral epics. It describes Vladimir's captivity in Bulgaria, the love between Kosara and him, Tsar Samuel's blessing of their marriage, and their wedding. It concludes with the newlyweds setting off for Vladimir's court, which Mio&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt; places in the Herzegovinian city of Trebinje.110111
The Greek akolouthia on Saint Jovan Vladimir, containing his hagiography and hymns to be chanted in churches at canonical hours during his feast day, was printed in Venice in 1690. The book was reprinted with small changes in 1774 and 1858. It was written from oral traditions by the deputy of the Orthodox Archbishop of Ohrid, Cosmas, who resided at the Monastery of Saint Jovan Vladimir, near Elbasan. Copies of the book were distributed to other Orthodox churches and individuals. The akolouthia was also published in 1741 in Moscopole, an Aromanian center in southeastern Albania, as part of a compilation dedicated to saints popular in that region.112 A shorter hagiography of the saint, based on his life contained in this akolouthia, was included in the Synaxarium composed by Nicodemus the Hagiorite, printed in Venice (1819) and Athens (1868).113114 Cosmas's text was the basis for the Church Slavonic akolouthias on the saint, which appeared in Venice (1802) and Belgrade (1861). The latter was printed as part of the third edition of Srbljak, a compendium of akolouthias on Serb saints, published by the Serbian Orthodox Church.115 The saint's life in English, translated from Church Slavonic, appeared in the book Lives of the Serbian Saints, published in London in 1921 by the Anglican Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.116
In Cosmas's writing, the saint was named &quot;Jovan from Vladimir&quot;; his father was Nemanja (historically, Grand Prince of Ra&lt;U+0161&gt;ka from 1166 to 1196), and his grandfather was Simeon (Bulgarian Tsar from 893 to 927). He married a daughter of Samuel, the tsar of Bulgaria and Ohrid. He succeeded his father as emperor of Albania, Illyria, and Dalmatia. After Byzantine Emperor Basil defeated Tsar Samuel, Emperor Jovan defeated Basil. He also fought against the Bogomil and Messalian heretics. From his early youth, Jovan Vladimir longed for the Kingdom of God. After he was married, he prayed day and night, and abstained from intercourse with his wife. She was a heretic like her brother, whom she incited to kill Jovan. When the two brothers-in-law rode together, accompanied by soldiers, the heretic suddenly struck Jovan with a sword at a mountain pass named Derven, but could not cut him. Only when Jovan gave him his own sword was the murderer able to cut off his head. Jovan caught it in the air and rode on to the church he had built near Elbasan. There he put his head down, saying, &quot;Lord Jesus Christ, in your hands I place my spirit,&quot; and died; it was  899. He was buried in the church, which then became the scene of many miracles.117 The saint's beneficent power is described in the hagiography:118

He is in one place, but felt in the whole world wherever he is called. There, in the Heaven, he stands next to the Christ God, and here he does not at all go away from us. There he intercedes for us, and here he triumphs with us. There he serves, and here he makes miracles. His relics rest, and his deeds preach; his tongue is silent, and his miracles call out. Whoever saw something like this? Whoever heard of such a thing? His bones are enclosed in the sepulcher, and his miracles are seen in the whole world.






The kontakion which is contained, among other hymns, in the Church Slavonic akolouthia published as part of Srbljak, praises the saint:119






Like a valuable treasury and a spring that flows earthly courses cleansing from diseases, we have been given your sacred body, which bestows healing from various illnesses and God's grace upon those who approach it with faith, so that we cry to it: Rejoice, Prince Vladimir.






 A classical example of the iconography of Saint Jovan Vladimir appears in the 1858 edition of his Greek akolouthia. The illustration shows the saint wearing a crown with a double lily wreath, his right foot on a sword. He holds a cross, a sceptre, and an olive branch in his right hand, while his crowned severed head is in his left hand. He wears an ermine cloak and a robe with floral designs, adorned with large gems surrounded by pearls. The Greek text beneath the illustration names the saint as Jovan Vladimir, the pious Emperor of all Albania and Bulgaria, the graceful Wonderworker and Great Martyr, and true Myrrh-gusher.120121 In his hagiography included in the Synaxarium of Nicodemus the Hagiorite, the saint is referred to as Emperor of the Serbs (&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+1FF6&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt; &lt;U+03A3&gt;&lt;U+03AD&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03B2&gt;&lt;U+03C9&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt; &lt;U+03B2&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BB&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03CD&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt;).122
Saint Jovan Vladimir is represented on frescos and icons in three monasteries of Mount Athos: Hilandar, Zograf, and Philotheou; three Bulgarian monasteries: Rila, Troyan, and Glozhene; in the Ardenica Monastery in Albania; and in the Saint Catherine's Monastery on the Sinai Peninsula.123124 Hristofor Zhefarovich, an engraver and painter from Macedonia, created in 1742 in Vienna a copperplate depicting the saint's miracles. Its printed impressions were disseminated to a great number of Orthodox Christian homes throughout the Balkans. The same author included him among the rulers and saints whom he illustrated in his Stemmatographia. The cult of Saint Jovan Vladimir was popular in Macedonia, especially during the 18th century, when he was often depicted on frescoes and icons in Macedonian churches.125
Legends
Several legends about Jovan Vladimir have been recorded in western Macedonia. One has it that, after he was beheaded, he brought his head to the Monastery of Saint John of Bigor. On a hill above the village of Peso&lt;U+010D&gt;ani in the Municipality of Debarca, there is a locality called Vladimirovo, at which some ruins can be seen. The locals claimed that Vladimir was born there, and brought his severed head there.126 The Church of Saint Athanasius near Peso&lt;U+010D&gt;ani, now in ruins, is reputed to have been built by Vladimir. People from the region gathered there each year on the eve of his feast day. They lit candles on the remains of the church's walls, and prayed to the saint.127 Tradition has it that the Monastery of Saint Naum near Ohrid had a bell tower named after the saint, in the foundation of which a portion of his relics was placed.128
In the western fringe of Macedonia, which is now part of Albania, Jovan Vladimir was remembered as a saintly ruler, cut down by his father-in-law, an emperor, who believed some slander that he was a womanizer. The enraged emperor, accompanied by soldiers, found Vladimir on a mountain pass named Qaf&lt;U+00EB&gt; Than&lt;U+00EB&gt; (also known as Derven), on the road between the Macedonian town of Struga and Elbasan. He struck his son-in-law with a sword, but could not cut him. Only when Vladimir gave him his own sword was the emperor able to cut off his head. Vladimir took his severed head and went toward Elbasan. He fell under an oak, after the tree bowed down before him. The saint was interred in the church which was subsequently built at that place and dedicated to him.129

According to a legend recorded in the Greek hagiography, Jovan Vladimir built the church near Elbasan. Its location, deep in a dense forest, was chosen by God, and an eagle with a shining cross on its head showed it to Vladimir. After the saint was decapitated, he brought his head to the church, and was buried inside. A group of Franks once stole the casket with his miraculous relics. The casket turned out to be extremely heavy, breaking the backs of hinnies on which the Franks carried it. They eventually put it in the Shkumbin River to take it to the sea, but the river flooded, and the casket&lt;U+2014&gt;radiating light&lt;U+2014&gt;went back upstream toward the church. The inhabitants of that area took it out of the water and returned it to the church in a festive procession.130
A group of thieves stole, on a summer day, horses that belonged to the Monastery of Saint Jovan Vladimir. When they came to the nearby stream of Kusha to take the horses across, it appeared to them like an enormous river. They moved away from it in fear, but when they looked back from a distance, the stream appeared small. As they approached it again, the Kusha again became huge and impassable. After several such attempts to cross the stream, the thieves realized that this was a miracle of the saint, so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.131
A possible legend of Prince Vladimir was recorded by Branislav Nu&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt; in the 19th century in the city of Kor&lt;U+00E7&gt;&lt;U+00EB&gt;, southeastern Albania, close to Macedonia. Ruins on top of a hill above Kor&lt;U+00E7&gt;&lt;U+00EB&gt; were said to be remains of the court of a Latin (Catholic) king, whose kingdom neighbored the state of an Orthodox emperor. The king asked the hand of the emperor's daughter, who agreed to become his wife only if he built an Orthodox church. He did so, and she married him, but on the first night of marriage she killed him. She then became a nun, and the king's body was taken somewhere&lt;U+2014&gt;he was not buried near his court.132 Macedonian Slavs inhabiting Saint Achillius Island in the Small Prespa Lake in Greece told of an emperor named Mir&lt;U+010D&gt;e. He lived on their island, where he was killed by a cousin of his out of jealousy, and his body was taken via Ohrid to Albania.133
