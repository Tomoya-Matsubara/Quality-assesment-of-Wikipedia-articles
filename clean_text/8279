Dauphin County
Route 209 begins at Market Square (PA 147) in Millersburg, a block east of the Susquehanna River. Known as Union Street, US 209 moves eastward until Union Avenue goes straight at a fork as 209 turns onto State Street. Where the highway traverses the eastern portions of the municipality, Pennsylvania Route 25 intersects it. Outside of Millersburg, 209 follows an east-west alignment, although the road is signed north-south. After turning east for a little while, 209 enters the borough of Reservoir Heights. Leaving the borough, 209 begins a more northeasterly course. In Elizabethville, 209 is signed as Main Street and has an intersection with Pennsylvania Route 225.2 East of the borough, 209 takes a more northernly course while traversing a mountainous region of the state. This section of 209 designates the route between Bear and Peters Mountains. The road also passes south of Spechty Kopf (elv. 1,508 ft.) and Weiser State Forest near the Dauphin-Schuylkill county line.3 Northeast of Williams, 209 intersects with State Route 4010 before entering Schuykill County.
For much of its course in Dauphin County, 209 parallels the Wiconisco Creek.4
Schuykill County
Upon entering Schuylkill County, 209 intersects Pennsylvania Route 325 in Tower City. Entering Jolliett, the road is known as 2nd street until the intersection with Quadrant Route 4011, also known as Main Street. North of Lorberry, 209 connects to Interstate 81 southbound via Township Road 634. Briefly east, 209 has access to I-81 northbound.5 After crossing Interstate 81, US 209 enters Tremont, where it intersects with Pennsylvania Route 125. The two roads merge together for a short distance. SR 125 leaves to the right just as 209 exits Tremont. 209 soon enters Reilly Township, where Pennsylvania Route 25 leaves to the left towards Interstate 81.
209 crosses through some local boroughs and enters the CDP of Marlin. In downtown Marlin, 209 becomes concurrent with Pennsylvania Route 901.6 901 soon leaves to the right and 209 continues straight ahead as West Market Street in Pottsville. 209 enters downtown Pottsville and intersects with Quadrant Route 3001. Soon after 3001, 209 crosses Claude A Lord Boulevard (PA 61) and enters Mechanicsville.7 Now known as Coal Street, US 209 enters Port Carbon. US 209 goes through a local town and soon enters New Philidelphia, where it forks with Quadrant Route 2003 (Farmdale Road). When 209 enters Tamaqua, it crosses with Pennsylvania Route 309 and becomes East Broad Street. The route progresses on a northeast alignment from Tamaqua. In Lansford, 209 intersects Pennsylvania Route 902.8
Carbon County
East of Lansford, approaching Nesquehoning, 209 curves to the north. In downtown Nesquehoning, 209 turns east at the eastern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 54. This portion of 209 is designated parallel to Broad Mountain, located north of the route. Past the downtown area of the borough, 209 intersects the southern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 93.9
In Nesquehoning Junction, 209 begins to parallel the Lehigh River, making the route turn southward approaching Jim Thorpe. At Lehigh Gorge State Park, 209 intersects Pennsylvania Route 903 (River Street). In downtown Jim Thorpe, 209 turns southward at the Broadway junction. The route leaves the borough as Susquehanna Street following the banks of the Lehigh River. In the Palmerton Junction area, the route curves eastward and southward.10
In Lehighton, 209 splits into a pair of carriageways into the commercial district of the borough. The two carriageways merge south of the downtown area, approaching the eastern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 443. At the PA 443 junction, 209 turns east to cross the Lehigh River.11
At the end of the bridge, 209 intersects Pennsylvania Route 248. From there, 209 is signed as Interchange Road aligned eastward. In Harrity, 209 interchanges Interstate 476 (NE Extension of the PA Turnpike).12

US 209 then begins to paralell a couple of Scotia township roads, TR 221 to the north and TR 216 to the south. 209 then passes its auxillary route, U.S. Route 209 Business.17 In Scotia, TRs 220 and 218 begin to parallel until the intersection with Monroe County State Route 3023. Soon after crossing 3023, the road turns northand becomes concurrent with Pennsylvania Route 33. The roads stay concurrent for several miles, intersecting with only one route, State Route 2010 in Brandnerd Center. 209 then splits off to the east in Snydersville.18 209 at this point is now parallel to its auxillary route. Route 209 intersects State Route 2005 at a traffic signal and passes over SR 2007 before intersecting with its auxillary route once again. Soon after the interchange with US 209 Business, the main US 209 becomes concurrent with Interstate 80 in Bartonsville, beginning at Exit 304.19
The first intersection during the concurrency is with its auxillary route at Exit 305, due west of Stroudsburg.20 The next exit going eastward is for Pennsylvania Route 611 in East Stroudsburg. Going westward, this exit is for Pennsylvania Route 191. The next exit, Exit 308 is for a local street in East Stroudsburg. A mile later, 209 leaves at Exit 309 towards Marshalls Creek as Seven Bridges Road. The first intersection is with Pennsylvania Route 447, Independence Road, which leaves to the left.21 About 3 miles later, after passing local roads, 209 intersects with the western terminus of its auxillary route and now turns northward. 209 enters the hamlet of Marshalls Creek, now known as Milford Road. PA Route 402 leaves to the left soon after and then leaves the hamlet. For several miles, 209 crosses local roads in several hamlets. The next major intersection on 209 is for State Route 2028, also known as River Road. A couple miles after QR 2028, 209 enters Pike County in the town of Bushkill. At this point, you now enter a controlled area of 209 by the National Park Service.22 The road enters the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area for about 20 miles. In this section of 209, commercial veichles have to pay money to drive on the road.23 The mile markers are also different in this section, with the first tollbooth being mile marker zero.

About 6 miles in, Township Route 337, Tom's Creek Road, leaves to the left towards a picnic area.27 TR 337 soon merges back in with 209. After a period of inactivity, Briscoe Mountain Road leaves to the left towards the Pocono Enviromental Education Center. Later, Chestnut Ridge Road leaves to the left towards George W. Childs State Park. Close to 13 miles, South Johnny Bee Road and Johnny Bee Road crosses 209.28 The first traffic light since Monroe QR 2028 is at Pennsylvania Route 739 and Pike County QR 2019 in Dingmans Ferry. Turning left onto 739 will take you towards downtown Dingmans Ferry, while turning right onto 2019 will take you to New Jersey via the Dingman's Ferry Bridge.29 After a five mle section of inactivity, QR 2009, Raymondskill Road, leaves to the left. 209 then reaches the second tollbooth at the north end of the Delaware Water Gap, 20 miles in. Soon after leaving, U.S. Route 206 merges into 209 for less than a mile. 206 suddenly ends and 209 goes on, entering Milford. Now known as East Harford Street, 209 crosses through downtown Milford. U.S. Route 6 then merges in from the north and the two routes turn east towards Matamoras.30
The now concurrent Routes 6 and 209 go west, parallelling Interstate 84.31 About four miles into the concurrency, Exit 53 of Interstate 84 intersects with 6/209.32 A few more miles, 6 and 209 cross the border into Port Jervis, New York via the Mid-Delaware Bridge, over 50 miles from Brodheadsville.33 From the years 1941 to 1959, Pennsylvania Route 963 started on the borderline of Pennsylvania and New York.3435 The route that was 963 is now known as State Route 1017.36
History
The National Park Service began the rule of no trucks along the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area on 209 in August 1983. The bill was passed by President Ronald Reagan on the 1st of the month.37 It was projected to begin in April, but the bill was delayed 180 days.38
Future developments
Bypass of Marshalls Creek


The area where 209 intersects Pennsylvania Route 402 has been plauged by traffic issues for over a decade. In 1990, studies began to making a bypass of the intersection, which is located in the hamlet of Marshalls Creek in Middle Smithfield Township. The traffic had gotten so bad, the town had considered a bypass for the area. The proposal for a bypass was passed in October 2004 and was going to cost $70 million.39 The total distance used by the bypass is 3.5 miles and is going to be made out of asphalt. There will be nine new signalized intersections, seven are on 209, 1 is on 402 and one is on River Road (Monroe 2028). The constructors are expecting that during the six-year project, traffic will remain the same on 209, and no detours of 402 and 209 are planned.40 The first of three phases of construction was completed in the Summer of 2007 and cost $14.2 million. Phase 2, projected to start in Fall of 2007, is proposed to cost $17 million.41
