The ship prefix MS Louis Majesty formerly ship prefix MS Norwegian Majesty is a cruise ship owned and operated by Louis Cruise Lines. She was originally ordered by Birka Line as MS Birka Queen from the Wrtsil Marine Turku Shipyard in Finland, but completed by Kvaerner Masa-Yards as MS Royal Majesty for Majesty Cruise Line. In 1997 she was sold to Norwegian Cruise Line and lengthened by convert 33.76 m ftin abbr=on at the Lloyd Werft shipyard in Bremerhaven, Germany. Two passengers died when the ship was hit by a rogue wave in 2010.

Concept and construction

The Birka Queen was ordered by Birka Line for short cruises out of Stockholm as a running mate to MS Birka Princess. The ship was ordered from Wrtsil Marine, but the shipyard went bankrupt in 1990. Operations were soon reorganized under the name of Masa-Yards,cite book  title=Siljan viisi vuosikymment  last=Malmberg  first=Thure  coauthors=Stampehl, Marko  year=2007  publisher=Frenckellin Kirjapaino Oy  location=Espoo  isbn=978-951-98405-7-4  language=Finnish/English  pages=153154  but the price of the ship was increased in the process, and Birka therefore refused to take delivery. Instead, the build contact was sold to Majesty Cruise Line, who took delivery of the ship on July 2, 1992, renaming her Royal Majesty.

Service history

Current section date=March 2010

Following delivery, the Royal Majesty set on her maiden voyage, a transatlantic crossing from Southampton to New York City, on July 7, 1992. She was officially christened in New York City on July 21, 1992. She was christened by Liza Minelli. Following this, she was used on three- and four-night cruises out of Florida. In 1995 she initiated a new northern hemisphere summer season itenary with cruises from Boston to St. George's, Bermuda, returning to Florida for the winter season. In September 1995 she participated in an expedition to the sinking site of RMS Titanic, spending five days at the site with many survivors from the famous ship onboard, while parts of the Titanic were being salvaged.cite web  url=http://www.simplonpc.co.uk/RoyalMajesty.html  title=Royal Majesty  accessdate=2008-04-23  date=  last=Boyle  first=Ian  work=Simplon Postcards  language=

On June 10, 1995, Royal Majesty grounded on Rose and Crown Shoal about 10 miles east of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, and about 17 miles from where the
watch officers thought the vessel was. The vessel, with 1,509 persons on board, was en route from St.
Georges, Bermuda, to Boston, Massachusetts. There were no deaths or injuries as a result of this
accident. Damage to the vessel and lost revenue, however, were estimated at about $7 million. cite web  url=http://www.ntsb.gov/Publictn/1997/MAR9701.pdf  title=NTSB Marine Accident Reportcite web  url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/12/us/cruise-ship-carrying-1500-runs-aground.html  title=Cruise Ship Carrying 1,500 Runs Aground -NY Times

Majesty Cruise Line ceased operations at the end of the 1997 summer season, and the Royal Majesty was sold to Norwegian Cruise Line.cite web  url=http://www.simplonpc.co.uk/MajestyCruiseLine.html  title=Majesty Cruise Line  accessdate=2008-04-23  date=  last=Boyle  first=Ian  work=Simplon Postcards  language=  She was renamed Norwegian Majesty, and in 1999 she received a convert 33.76 m ftin abbr=on lengthening at the Lloyd Werft shipyard in Bremerhaven, Germany. Similar lenghtenings had been carried out on NCL's Dreamward and Windward the previous year. The lengthening of the Norwegian Majesty however was more technically complicated than those of the other ships, as she had not been designed for such an operation.

In 2004 the ownership of the Norwegian Majesty was transferred to NCL's parent company Star Cruises in preparation for potential transfer to the Star Cruises fleet or sale at a later date. She remained in NCL service without other changes. On April 23, 2008 the Norwegian Majesty, was sold to the Cyprus-based Louis Cruise Lines. Louis Cruise Lines had reportedly outbid International Shipping Partners with their offer of USD $162 million.cite web  url=http://dougnewmanatsea.com/2008/04/18/seatrade-pride-of-america-not-sold/  title=Seatrade: Pride of America Not Sold  accessdate=2008-04-19  date=2008-04-18  last=Newman  first=Doug   work=At Sea with Doug Newman  publisher=  The deal was completed on July 29, 2008, but the Norwegian Majesty will be chartered back to Norwegian Cruise Line until October 2009.cite web url=http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/news/star-cruises-218m-norwegian-dream-sale-fails/20017575692.htm title=Star Cruises $218m Norwegian Dream sale fails last=Hand first=Marcus date=2008-09-30 publisher=Lloyd's List accessdate=2008-09-30

On June 24, 2009, Louis revealed that the Norwegian Majesty would be renamed Louis Majesty.http://cruiseind.wordpress.com/2009/06/24/louis-majesty/

On 3 March 2010, three rogue waves hit the Louis Majesty, killing two passengers, and injuring a number of others, while on a 12 day cruise around the Mediterranean. The waves, which were reportedly in excess of convert 26 ft m 0 high, collided with the side of the vessel, smashing several windows in the saloon area. Water was taken on in the saloon area, which then drained down the decks below. The ship returned to port at Barcelona, Spain to receive repairs.cite web url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8548547.stm  title=Two killed as giant waves hit Mediterranean cruise ship  publisher=BBC News Online  accessdate=4 March 2010
