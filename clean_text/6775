Crispin McDougal Freeman (born February 9 1972 in Chicago, Illinois) is a prolific American voice actor best known for his roles as Alucard in Hellsing and the OVA Hellsing Ultimate and as Touga Kiryuu from Revolutionary Girl Utena. He also played the voice of Kouichi Kimura in Digimon: Digital Monsters, Prince Turnip in Hayao Miyazaki's movie adaptation of Howl's Moving Castle, and Zelgadis Greywords in Slayers.
Biography
Crispin Freeman was the oldest of three children, having a younger brother, Clark, and a younger sister, Cassidy. All of which attended the Latin School of Chicago, where he graduated in 1990 in a class of 60. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Williams College, majoring in Theater and minoring in Computer Science. Afterward, he earned his Master of Fine Arts degree from Columbia University in Acting, and performed on Broadway (New York City), the American Repertory Theater (Cambridge), the Mark Taper Forum (Los Angeles), Cincinnati's Playhouse in the Park, and the Williamstown Theator Festival.
As a child, Freeman was greatly influenced by anime shows such as Speed Racer and Battle of the Planets (Gatchaman). Casey Kasem voiced the role of his favorite character, Mark of Battle of the Planets, a.k.a., Ken the Eagle in Gatchaman. He actually wanted to change his name to Mark at one point. Later, he discovered Voltron, Star Blazers, and Robotech, being quoted in the January 1999 issue of America Interview saying, &quot;That show really blew me away.&quot;
Freeman initially got involved in the anime voice-over industry when a friend of his landed a role in Peacock King. Knowing Freeman was a big anime fan, the friend suggested he call up Central Park Media and apply for a job doing english dubs. At first he didn't see why, being a fan of subtitles, rather than the english counter-parts. It wasn't until he remembered all of the anime shows he watched as a child did he realize that most people are introduced to anime through the english dubbed versions.
In 1995, Freeman landed the role of Zelgadis Greywords in Slayers. He was the fourth and final voice actor to get the job, the previous three sounding too monotone and timid for the gloomy, angst ridden character. 1
Since then, Freeman has had various roles throughout his career. The most recent being Haji and Van Argeno in Blood+, which airs Saturday, on Adult Swim at 12:30am, e.t. 2
On August 11th, 2007, he married his love, Izobel Carol, on the island of Hawaii at the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel. His brother Clark was best man.
