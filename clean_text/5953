Boxing Fever is a boxing video game developed by Digital Fiction and published by Majesco for the Game Boy Advance. It was released in North America on October 30, 2001, and in Europe on February 15, 2002.
Boxing Fever is a first person boxing game, with the game's perspective being behind the eyes of your fighter in a ring. Multiplayer is supported through the link cable. Boxing Fever received positive reviews from critics, who noted its creative visual style. As of 2009, Boxing Fever has received compilation scores of 76% and 75% on MetaCritic and GameRankings respectively.
Gameplay
The game places the player from the perspective of the figher, in a first person view; the graphical engine gives the illusion of 3D. The user punches and blocks with the d-pad, while avoiding punches entirely by weaving with the shoulder buttons.1
There are four championships for the player to complete in throughout the course of gameplay; all of them are available from the start of gameplay and do not need to be earned through performance in the game. Boxing Fever lacks a battery save feature, and instead uses an 8-digit password system.2
