are a Japanese Visual Kei band who formed around 1993 in Sapporo, the current incarnation of the band features only one original member; Takayuki.
History
The group recorded their debut album in 1995 called &quot;Ryouki Kousatsu Chissoku-Shi&quot;, the band consisted of Chihiro (Vocals), Takayuki (Guitar), Yoshio (Bass) and Hiroshi (Drums), this album was done in a melodic Hard Rock style with lyrics by Chihiro and even featured a cover of a Hanoi Rocks song; Dead By Xmas.
Tragically on October 25, 1995, while shooting a promotional video; Chihiro and Hiroshi died in an incident which included the two of them allegedly jumping off a bridge into a river, it is debated whether this was an accident or suicide. In 1997, Yoshio committed suicide, leaving Takayuki as the sole living member.
In 1998, the only remaining member from the original carnation, Takayuki re-created the group appointing vocalist Kirala, who previously performed in the band Slum Junkie, bassist Ruiji from the band Mazohysteria and drummer Shizuki.
The Piass released their second album, a self-titled effort which would prove to be a huge departure from their original sound, the group now had a frantic punk rock sound apposed to the more hard rock sound of the previous album. An E.P. would be recorded the following year called &quot;Gekka Kyoushou&quot;. Their latest release was a single in 2001 called &quot;Aki Ryuusa ~Akina Zuna&quot;.
Current status
2002 saw vocalist Kirala departing The Piass, they now remain as a three piece band with Takayuki handling both vocal and guitar duties. Although the group hasn't released music for a while, they are still active, touring as recent as 2005.
The Piass have also released a collaboration with the band RA's TeSTARS, entitled &quot;Color.&quot; It includes four tracks.
On May 24, 2006, the Piass released their newest album, Kansensho Paranoia. This is a great step forward for the band, as it is their very first release as The Piass since the departure of ex-vocalist Kirala. Kansensho Paranoia consists of three all new tracks and a bonus DVD with a PV for the song &quot;Shitakiri Suzume&quot;. It is a limited issue CD.
On March 5, 2007, bassist Ruiji and drummer Shizuki have left the band. Vocalist Takayuki continues to stay with the band for lives using support members.
