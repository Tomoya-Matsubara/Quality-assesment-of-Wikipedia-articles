State Highway 321, or SH 321, is a north-south highway in southeastern Texas between Cleveland, starting Loop 573 in downtown and proceeding south to Dayton, where it terminates at US 90.
In Cleveland, SH 321 is also known as Houston Street, providing the main street for downtown Cleveland. It is a two lane urban highway with a left turn lane as it travels throughout Cleveland, until roughly 3/4 of a mile northeast of the city limit. From Loop 573, on southward until junction with SH 105, SH 321 is also known as SH 105. In the city of Dayton, it is referred to as North Cleveland Street, passing through residential Dayton as a 4 lane urban highway, before narrowing back down to a 2 lane rural State Highway.
SH 321 is part of the eastern Greater Houston area evacuation route, providing a corridor for communites such as Baytown, Kemah, and Pasadena.
Future Plans
There is currently a proposal for a new loop around Cleveland, Loop 105 that will start near the SE city limit of Cleveland on SH321 and travel to the south west, intersecting with US 59 and coming back NW back to SH105, west of Cleveland. Construction is supposed to begin late 2006- early 2007.
The Cleveland Advocate 1, July 24, 2007 edition, gives an update of the status and also includes more detail of the route of the bypass. 2
The construction contract will be let in November 2007. Ground breaking will be no later than January 2008. The value of the contract is estimated at $50MM. The
Houston-Galveston Area Council long term plans (by 2025) show plans to expand SH 321 to an urban four lane divided highway with left turn lane, south out of Cleveland until SH 105 cuts east (6-8 miles south of Cleveland).
History
Based on Handbook of Texas article about Tarkington Prairie, SH 321 is believed to cover part of the Nacogdoches-Lynchburg trail, being the Old Wells store (as it is referred to on the historical marker) sits along the trail, and the SH321 runs directly in front of the building.
