Malvern College is a coeducational independent school located on a 250 acre (101 ha) campus near the town centre of Malvern, Worcestershire in England.1 Founded in 1865,2 it was one of the twenty four Public Schools listed in the Public Schools Yearbook of 1889. Until 1992, the College was a secondary school for boys aged 13 to 18. Following a series of mergers, with private primary schools and a girl's school in the area, it has since become coeducational with pupils from 3 to 19 years old.3 In 2008 the school had a total of 600 pupils, of which around 480 were boarders aged 12 - 19.4 The school is known for its innovative approaches to education and for sports. Among its alumni are at least two Prime Ministers,5 two Nobel Laureates and an Olympic Gold medalist. The novelist C. S. Lewis, author of The Chronicles of Narnia was also a former student of the school. It is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and of the Rugby Group of prestigious British independent schools. An Ofsted report following a February 2010 inspection rated the school's boardiing facilities with a Grade 2 (good).6
History
  Set in the Malvern Hills, the school's location owes much to Malvern's emergence in the nineteenth century as a fashionable spa resort, appreciated for its unpolluted air and the healing qualities of its famous spring water.
The school opened its doors for the first time in January 1865. Initially, there were only about twenty four boy pupils, around six teachers and two houses.7 Expansion was rapid and in 1877, there were 290 boys and six Houses, and by the end of the 1890s the school had around 600 boys in 10 boarding houses.8 Further expansion of pupil numbers and buildings continued between the end of the Great War in 1918 and the start of the Second World War in 1939.
During World War II the College premises were requisitioned by the Admiralty between October 1939 and July 1940, when the school was temporarily relocated to Blenheim Palace. In 1942, its premises were again needed for governmental use, on this occasion by the TRE and, from May 1942 to July 1946, the school was housed with Harrow School. QinetiQ, a private sector successor to the government's original research facility, is still sited on former College land.9
Having traditionally been a school for boys aged from 13 to 18 years old, in 1992, it merged with Ellerslie Girls&lt;U+2019&gt; School and Hillstone prep school to become coeducational with pupils from 3 to 18 years old.1 In September 2008, the College's Prep School merged with The Downs prep school on the latter's nearby site in Colwall, Herefordshire to form The Downs, Malvern College Prep School.10
The year 2008, also, saw the start of a multi-million pound development scheme11 that included a new Sports Complex, new athletics and viewing facilities at the pitches and two new Boarding Houses. The Sports Complex and new houses were opened in October 2009 by HRH Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. Ellerslie House was opened for girls, commemorating the eponymous former girls' school, and the other new House has become the new permanent residence for the boys of No. 7.12
Sport
The school has a strong sporting tradition. For boy's sports, some Malvernians would consider the College to be best known as a football school although its cricket sides have also produced players who have gone on to play at international level. Traditionally, sport for boys used to be split between the original 'major sports' of football, cricket, and rackets (rugby was added later), and 'minor sports'. Colours were awarded for each major sport, as appropriate. After 1995, the distinction between 'major sport' and 'minor sport' was removed. The girls' main sports are hockey and lacrosse in the winter, lacrosse and netball in the Lent Term and tennis and rounders in the summer.
The College also plays a multitude of other sports such as Rackets, Fives, Athletics, Tennis, Squash, Croquet, Basketball, Badminton and Polo. Some boy's hockey and girl's football are played.13
On October 16, 2009, a new sports complex and hospitality suite was opened by Prince Andrew. The opening was attended by several well known sports personalities including athlete Dame Kelly Holmes, cricketers Michael Vaughan and Graham Gooch, footballer Peter Shilton, rugby union player Jason Leonard, athlete Christina Boxer and hockey player Rachel Walker.14 The indoor sports facilities which have been built on the site of the old swimming pool are also used for training by Worcestershire County Cricket Club.1516 The facility which offers an 8 court sports hall, a dance studio and fitness suite, a climbing wall, two squash courts, a shooting range, a large function suite, and a 6 lane swimming pool, is also available for use by the wider community.17
Curriculum
While academic success is considered important, emphasis is also placed on the all-round development of the individual rather than on academic results alone.18 In the Sixth Form, courses are offered at A-Level in art, business studies, classical civilisation, design and technology, drama and theatre studies, economics, English literature, geography, Greek, history, history of art, key skills, Latin, mathematics, modern landuages (French, German, Spanish), music, music technology, physical education, politics and the sciences (biology, chemistry, physics).19 Further courses are available at International Baccalaureate level,20 and special arrangements are sometimes made for other courses upon request.21
Activities
Activities offered in addition to the academic curriculum include sports (see above), Combined Cadet Force (CCF), the Duke of Edinburgh's Award and First Aid. Orchestra/Band, Orienteering, Outdoor Pursuits, Photography, Practical Engineering, Riding, and Skiing,22Facilities are also available (in some cases, by prior arrangement) for independent extra-curricular activities such as journalism and music rehearsal.

Houses
A House is a component of the school community and a place where pupils reside and engage in private study. Normally, a pupil remains at his chosen House until he leaves the school. Each house has its own colours. Competitions are regularly arranged between the Houses in a range of academic, artistic and sporting activities. With the exceptions of School House and Ellerslie House, the eleven houses at Malvern are named with numbers 1 to 9, a system which used to be used at Roedean School, a girl's school founded by the sisters of the Old Malvernian judge Sir Paul Ogden Lawrence. The houses, in order of foundation are:

Events

Commemoration Day


The main social event of the school calendar Commemoration Day, or &quot;Commem&quot; as it is known in the school, celebrates the founding of the school. A service is held where prizes are awarded. A cricket match then takes place between the 1st cricket XI and the Free Foresters. The inter-house Athletics competition and the Summer Concert take place on the Friday before Commem. It is held on the Saturday of Half-term in the Summer term.

the CVS Ball


The School Council organises a charity ball, a black tie themed event that takes place in the 5th week of every Autumn Term. A similar event called The Autumn Ball is held for the Lower School.

the inter-house Singing Competition


This is held annually in the summer term. It is one of the most significant inter-house events on the school social calendar.

The Ledder


The Ledder, or Ledbury Run, is a  cross country race that starts in the town of Ledbury, goes over the Malvern Hills and finishes on the Senior, the main cricket pitch in the centre of the College. The first 9 runners receive Ledder Caps. In its early days there was no organised route and pupils simply had to get back to college as fast as they could. 

Remembrance Sunday


On the Sunday closest to the 11th of November, known as Remembrance Sunday, the entire college assembles in front of St. George to await a procession of parents, alumni, guests and teachers. Two minutes silence is followed by The Last Post and a reading. Representatives of the student body (the Senior Chapel Prefect, who is the Head Boy or Girl) and of the Old Malvernian Society then place wreaths at the foot of St. George. A memorial service follows in the chapel for the more than 400 Malvernians who lost their lives in the Great War.
Carmen Malvernense
The school song was written and composed by two masters, M. A. Bayfield and R. E. Lyon. Although not sung for the past decade it has recently been revived and was sung at the 2008 Commem.


Exultemus, O sodales,

Iam cessare fas novales,

Paululum laxemus mentes,

Dulcem, domum repententes,

Age soror iuxta fratrem,

Celebremus Almam Matrem,

Quae nos ornat, haec ornanda,

Quae nos amat, adamanda.


The same song became the school song of Eastbourne College when Bayfield became headmaster there in 1895.23
Innovations
In 1963 the college was the first independent school to have a language laboratory. Under the direction of John Lewis24, a former master, it pioneered Nuffield Physics2526 in the 1960s, Science in Society2728 in the 1970s, and the Diploma of Achievement29 in the 1990s. At the beginning of the 1990s, Malvern College became one of the first schools in Britain to offer the choice between the International Baccalaureate and A-Levels in the Sixth Form.30 The school was one of the first boy's public schools to become coeducational for pupils from 3 to 18 years.31
Each summer the staff and some older pupils run a summer school, Young Malvern, which incorporates many sports, activities and learning experiences, and with Dulwich College, Malvern College is one of the two schools in the country to offer Debating in the curriculum and pupils participate in regional and national competitions including the Debating Matters competition and the Three Counties Tournament.3233 The subject is compulsory at Foundation Year level.34
Notable alumni

The school's alumni are known as Old Malvernians, or OM's. The Malvernian Society holds many annual reunions and events and Old Malvernians, including former pupils of The Downs, Hillstone, and Ellerslie schools which have merged with Malvern College, benefit from a remission in fees for their own children.35 Other Old Malvernian clubs and societies include OM Lodge, Court Games, Golf, Sailing, Shooting, the Old Malvernians Cricket Club, and the Old Malvernians Football Club, a record breaking club competing in the Arthurian League.
Old Malvernians have been instrumental in the formation of sporting and charitable organisations such as Blackburn Rovers FC36 and the Docklands Settlements37.
At least two of the school's former pupils have become Nobel Laureates. Some past pupils are royalty from various nations, and others have become Heads of State, high ranking military officers, leading jurists, authors, and famous sportspeople.
Fire damage
In 2010 part of the school suffered serious damage when fire broke out on 10 April in one of the boardihg houses.38 The 1871 Grade 2 listed building which was the boarding house for 55 girls and living accommodation of the housemistress and her family,39 was almost completely destroyed.40 Over 70 firefighters aaaand 13 fire engines from Malvern, Worcester and Stourport on Severn depots fought the blaze.41
