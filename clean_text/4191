Leek Town Football Club is an English football club based in Leek, Staffordshire, currently playing in the Northern Premier League Premier Division. The team, nicknamed &quot;The Blues&quot;, play their home games at Harrison Park.
The club was founded in 1946 and played in a variety of local leagues, including the Staffordshire County League, Manchester League, Mid-Cheshire League and Cheshire County League, before becoming founder members of the North West Counties League in 1982 and from there progressing to the Northern Premier League in 1987. In 1997 they were Northern Premier League champions and gained promotion to the Football Conference, the highest level of English non-league football, although they only spent two seasons at that level before being relegated.
Leek Town reached the final of the FA Trophy in 1990, having progressed all the way from the First Qualifying Round, but lost in the final at Wembley Stadium.
History
Early history
Football was played in Leek from at least 1876, with an earlier side called simply Leek F.C. having been part of The Combination in the 1890s,1 but the current Leek Town club traces its lineage to the formation of a team called Leek Lowe Hamil in 1946 (although the club's official history does not mention it, some sources state that the club was initially known as Abbey Green Rovers before adopting the Lowe Hamil name).234
The club began life playing in the local Leek and Moorlands League, playing on a field adjoining a pub, before joining the Staffordshire County League in 1947. In 1949–50 Lowe Hamil were champions of this league, becoming the first (and to date only) team to win the title without losing a single match5 (some sources state this title win occurred in 1950–51).6 In 1951 the team switched to the Manchester League, adopting the name Leek Town at the same time,7 and won the championship at the very first attempt,8 after which the team relocated once more to the Mid-Cheshire League, where again they played for just one season.9 In 1954 the team joined the Birmingham &amp; District League but resigned in the middle of the 1956–57 season due to financial difficulties, after which they had another brief spell in the Manchester League, which was also curtailed due to monetary problems,10 before eventually returning to the Staffordshire County League.11
In 1968 a new committee was formed, under which the club emerged from the doldrums. Manager Paul Ogden took over in 1969 and led the club to two Staffordshire County League championships, followed in quick succession by two Manchester League titles.12 After the second Manchester League win Leek joined the Cheshire County League, where they were league champions at the second attempt in the 1974–75 season, but after Ogden left in 1975 to take over as manager of Northwich Victoria a series of managers came and went in quick succesion without being able to maintain this level of success.13
Modern history
In 1982 the Cheshire County League merged with the Lancashire Combination to form the new North West Counties League, where Leek spent five relatively unsuccessful seasons.14 During their spell in this league former England player Mike Pejic took over as manager, Leek's most high-profile appointment to date, but he had only a short reign before moving to Northwich Victoria.15 Folllowing Kevin Lewis' brief reign Neil Baker took over in 1986 and was to lead the club to its greatest success to date.
Leek were chosen to be among the founder members of the new Northern Premier League Division One in 1987 and in 1989–90 won the Division One title to gain promotion to the Premier Division, the highest level at which they had ever played. In the same season they progressed through eight rounds of the FA Trophy, including a quarter-final win over Darlington, that season's Conference champions, to reach the final at Wembley Stadium but were defeated 3–0 by Barrow.16
In 1993–94 Leek finished second in the Northern Premier League Premier Division, which should have been sufficient for promotion to the Football Conference, however they were refused promotion due to financial irregularities. To compound their problems, they were shifted from the Northern Premier League to the Southern League, with the resulting travel costs nearly crippling the club. After one season the club was allowed to return to the Northern Premier League.17
 In 1996–97 Leek again claimed the Northern Premier League title and were this time granted promotion to the Conference, but were relegated back to the Northern Premier League Premier Division after just two seasons.18
Recent years have seen the club achieve a series of mid-table finishes in the league but struggle off the pitch. On 21 June 2006 it was announced that the club was in such severe financial peril that it was facing a winding-up order,19 but on 11 June the following year it was confirmed that a new consortium had taken over the club and secured its future.20
Colours and crest
Leek's traditional colours are all blue,21 and their away colours all yellow,22 both colours which reflect the town's coat of arms, which is predominantly blue and gold.23
The club's crest features a garb and a Staffordshire knot, both of which are elements of the town's arms,24 as well as a caduceus, a symbol which appears on token coins issued in Leek in the 18th century.25
The team's shirts are currently sponsored by butter manufacturer Kerrygold, whose headquarters are in the town.26
Stadium
 Harrison Park lies on the outskirts of Leek and has been the team's home since 1948, when the club purchased what was then called Hamil Park for the sum of &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,250. Changing rooms were constructed in the 1950s (previously the players has been obliged to change in a nearby pub), along with the first covered accommodation for spectators, and floodlights (which had previously belonged to the defunct Rugby Town) were erected in 1972, soon after which the stadium was renamed Harrison Park after former club chairman Geoff Harrison.27
The ground currently has a seated stand along one side of the pitch, which was constructed in 1992,28 three covered terraces and a small amount of uncovered terracing.29 In 1998 the ground was flooded when a nearby dam burst and the river which runs alongside the ground overflowed.30
Leek CSOB of the North West Counties Football League currently share the ground.31
Supporters
In the 2006–07 season Leek's average attendance was 295, placing them twelfth out of twenty-two teams in the Northern Premier League Premier Division, although this was 5% up compared to the average of 280 in the previous season.32 During their two seasons in the Conference National, 1997–98 and 1998–99, the club's average home attendances were 78133 and 607.34
Statistics and records
 Leek's best ever league finish was a 19th place finish in Conference National (level 5 of the overall English football league system) in 1997–98, the first of two seasons the team played at that level. The Blues have only twice progressed as far as the rounds proper of the FA Cup, reaching the first round in 1993–94 and the second round in 1990–91, when they held Chester City to a draw at home but lost 4–0 in the replay.35
Leek reached the final of the FA Trophy in 1989–90 but lost 3–0 to Barrow at Wembley Stadium.36
The highest attendance figure recorded at Harrison Park came when the club played near-neighbours Macclesfield Town in an FA Cup 2nd qualifying round match in the 1973–74 season in front of a crowd of 3,512.37
