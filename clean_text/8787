Spirit
The Spirit Leaders of Kennesaw Mountain created two major student groups for supporting the athletic teams:
 The &quot;Kilt Squad&quot; consists of four seniors at KMHS who paint their faces and chests and also wear kilts to the football games. The current and founding fathers of the K-Side Kilt Squad (est. 2005) are Ben Ramsey (K), Ross Durrence (M), Stephen Halford (H), Samer Massad (S).
The &quot;K-Side Krazies&quot; are a student group which was formed after the famous &quot;Cameron Crazies&quot; from Duke University. The Kilt Squad play an integral role in the Krazies. Being such a large school, school spirit is vital for student involvement and participation.
