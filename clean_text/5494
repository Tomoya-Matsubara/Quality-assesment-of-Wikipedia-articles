 A South American dreadnought race between Argentina, Brazil and Chile began in 1907 when the Brazilian government announced its intention to purchase three dreadnoughts&lt;U+2014&gt;powerful battleships whose capabilities far outstripped older vessels in the world's navies. Previous Argentine&lt;U+2013&gt;Chilean naval arms races, combined with the overthrow of the Brazilian monarchy and subsequent naval rebellions, had left the Brazilian Navy well behind the Argentine and Chilean navies in quality and total tonnage. Brazilian politicians first moved to address this imbalance in 1904 as part of an overarching goal of becoming an international power. Three small battleships were ordered in late 1905, but after the appearance of the revolutionary British warship HMS  in 1906, the Brazilian government canceled all three in favor of the new &quot;dreadnought&quot; type.{{#tag:ref|cf. &quot;Obsolescence&quot; in Pre-dreadnought battleship.|group=upper-alpha}} Hulls for two Minas Geraes-class ships were laid down with a third to follow.
The Argentine and Chilean governments immediately canceled a pact limiting their navies, and each ordered two dreadnoughts (the Rivadavia and Almirante Latorre classes, respectively). Meanwhile, Brazil's third dreadnought, Rio de Janeiro, was canceled in favor of an even larger ship, which was laid down and ripped up several times after repeated alterations to the design. When the Brazilian government finally settled on a design, they realized it would be outclassed by larger super-dreadnoughts then being built, so they sold the ship to the Ottoman Empire and attempted to acquire a more powerful vessel.
The Brazilian government ordered one super-dreadnought from Armstrong, but the beginning of the First World War caused shipbuilders in the United Kingdom to suspend work on foreign warships, effectively canceling the ship. The war also caused the United Kingdom to purchase the two Chilean battleships before they were delivered, but Argentina's two dreadnoughts, built in the United States, were handed over in 1915. In the years after the war, many naval expansion plans, some involving dreadnought purchases, were proposed. While most never came to fruition, in April 1920 the Chilean government reacquired one of the dreadnoughts taken over by the United Kingdom. No other dreadnoughts were purchased by a South American nation, and all were sold for scrap in the 1950s.
Background
Argentine&lt;U+2013&gt;Chilean boundary dispute

Conflicting Argentine and Chilean claims to Patagonia, the southernmost region in South America, had been causing tension between the two countries since the 1840s. This tension was heightened in 1872 and 1878, when Chilean warships seized merchant ships which had been licensed to operate in the disputed area by the Argentine government. An Argentine warship did the same to a Chilean-licensed American ship in 1877. These actions nearly led to war in November 1878, when the Argentines dispatched a squadron of warships to the Santa Cruz River. The Chilean Navy responded in kind, and war was only avoided by a hastily signed treaty. Each government were distracted in the next few years, Argentina's with internal military operations against the indigenous population, and Chile's with the War of the Pacific (Guerra del Pac&lt;U+00ED&gt;fico) against Bolivia and Peru. Still, a full-fledged naval arms race was underway between Argentina and Chile by 1890.12
 Both sides began ordering warships from the United Kingdom. In 1887, the Chilean government added &lt;U+00A3&gt;3,129,500 to the budget for its fleet, which was centered around two aging central battery ironclads,  and , and a protected cruiser. They ordered the battleship , two protected cruisers, and two torpedo boats; their keels were laid in 1890. The Argentine government quickly responded with an order for two battleships,  and . The race continued through the 1890s, even after the expensive 1891 Chilean Civil War. The two countries alternated cruiser orders between 1890 and 1895, each ship marking a small increase in capabilities from the previous one. Argentina escalated the race in July 1895 by buying an armored cruiser, , from Italy. Chile responded by ordering its own armored cruiser, , and six torpedo boats; the Argentine government quickly ordered another cruiser from Italy and later bought two more.3
The race slowed for a few years after a boundary dispute in the Puna de Atacama region was successfully mediated in 1899 by the American ambassador to Argentina, William Paine Lord, but more ships were ordered by both countries in 1901. The Argentine Navy ordered two Rivadavia-class armored cruisers from Italy, and the Chilean Navy replied with orders for two Constituci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n-class pre-dreadnought battleships. The Argentines replied by signing letters of intent with the Italian engineering company Ansaldo in May 1901 to buy two larger battleships. The growing dispute disturbed members of the British government, as war looked like a very real possibility, and an armed conflict would disrupt the extensive British commercial interests in the area.{{#tag:ref|For example, the United Kingdom imported large amounts of Argentine grain—most of it shipped through the River Plate—and Chilean nitrates.4|group=upper-alpha}} Through their minister to Chile, they mediated negotiations between the two countries. These were successfully concluded on 28 May 1902 with three pacts. The third limited the naval armaments of both countries; both were barred from acquiring any further warships for five years without giving the other eighteen months' advance notice. The United Kingdom's Royal Navy purchased the two Chilean battleships, while the Imperial Japanese Navy took over the order for the two Argentine armored cruisers; the two Argentine battleships were never ordered. Two Argentine cruisers and Chile's Capit&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Prat were demilitarized.56
Brazil's fade and reemergence
Brazil's navy fell into obsolescence after an 1889 revolution, which deposed Emperor Dom Pedro II, and an 1893–94 navy revolt.789 Although their agreement limited the navies of Argentina and Chile, they still retained the numerous vessels built in the interim,1011 and so by the turn of the 20th century the Brazilian Navy lagged far behind its Argentine and Chilean counterparts in quality and total tonnage,121314{{#tag:ref|Chile's naval tonnage was , Argentina's , and Brazil's .15|group=upper-alpha}} despite Brazil having nearly three times the population of Argentina and almost five times that of Chile.1617 Rising demand for coffee and rubber brought Brazil an influx of revenue in the early 1900s.18 Simultaneously, there was a drive on the part of prominent Brazilians, most notably the Baron of Rio Branco,{{#tag:ref|A professional diplomat and the son of the famed Viscount of Rio Braco, &quot;Pedro II's favorite politician&quot;, the Baron of Rio Branco was named as Brazil's Foreign Minister in 1902, and served there until his death in 1912. In that time, he oversaw the signing of many treaties and mediated territorial disputes between Brazil and its neighbors, and became a famous name in his own right.19|group=upper-alpha}} to have the country recognized as an international power.20 The National Congress of Brazil drew up and passed a large naval acquisition program in late 1904, but it was two years before any ships were ordered.212223
Two factions argued over the types of ships to be ordered.24 One, supported by the British armament company Armstrong Whitworth, which eventually received the order,25 favored a navy centered around a small number of large warships, while the other preferred a larger navy of smaller warships.26 The latter faction originally prevailed. When Law no. 1452 was passed on 30 December 1905, which authorized &lt;U+00A3&gt;4,214,550 for new warship construction—of which &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,685,820 would be spent in 1906—three small battleships, three armored cruisers, six destroyers, twelve torpedo boats, three submarines, and two river monitors were ordered.27282930 Though the Brazilian government later eliminated the armored cruisers for reasons of cost, the Minister of the Navy, Admiral J&lt;U+00FA&gt;lio C&lt;U+00E9&gt;sar de Noronha, signed a contract with Armstrong Whitworth for three small battleships on 23 July 1906.3132
The American ambassador to Brazil was alarmed, and sent a cablegram to his Department of State in September 1906, warning them of the destabilization that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race. At the same time, the American government under Theodore Roosevelt tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into canceling their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with the Baron of Rio Branco remarking that caving to the American demands would render Brazil as powerless as Cuba, whose new constitution allowed the American government to intervene in Cuban affairs.33 The new President of Brazil, Afonso Pena, supported the naval acquisitions in an address to the National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as in his opinion the ships were necessary to replace the losses recently suffered by the navy, most notably the old Aquidab&lt;U+00E3&gt;, and the antiquated vessels of the current navy.3435
Catalyst: Brazil's dreadnoughts

Brazil laid the keels of three battleships, but Britain's new dreadnought concept, represented by the commissioning of the ship of the same name in December 1906, rendered the Brazilian ships obsolete before they were completed.36 Naval historian Robert Schenia claims that a transition to a few large warships was helped when Aquidab&lt;U+00E3&gt; exploded in January 1906, as it killed many of the small-ship supporters, but the final blow was the selection of a large-ship advocate, Rear Admiral Alexandrino Fario de Alencar, for the powerful post of minister of the navy in November.37 The money authorized for naval expansion in 1905 was redirected by de Alencar to building three dreadnoughts (with the third to be laid down after the first was launched), three scout cruisers (later reduced to two, which became the Bahia class), fifteen destroyers (later reduced to ten, the Par&lt;U+00E1&gt; class), three submarines (the F 1 class), and two submarine tenders (later reduced to one, Ceara).383940 The Brazilian Congress approved these changes with the stipulation that the total price of the naval program did not exceed the original limit, so the increase in battleship tonnage (originally planned to go from  to ) was bought with decreasing the number of destroyers.41 The three battleships on which construction had begun were scrapped beginning on 7 January 1907, and the design for the new dreadnoughts was approved on 20 February.42 Newspapers began reporting a Brazilian order for dreadnoughts in March,434445 while the full order, including all three dreadnoughts and the two cruisers, was revealed in August.4647
 The Brazilian order for these powerful new warships came at a time when few countries in the world had contracted for such armament. Brazil was the third country to have a dreadnought under construction, behind the United Kingdom, with Dreadnought and the Bellerophon class, and the United States, with the South Carolina class. This meant that Brazil could potentially have a dreadnought before many world powers, like Germany, France, Russia, and Japan,4849{{#tag:ref|Germany's first dreadnought was commissioned on 1 October 1909, about three months before Brazil's Minas Geraes was completed, despite being laid down two months after Brazil's ship.5051|group=upper-alpha}} and consequently the order caused a major stir. Newspapers and journals around the world speculated that Brazil was acting as a proxy for a naval power which would take possession of the two dreadnoughts soon after completion, as they did not believe that a previously insignificant geopolitical power would contract for such powerful armament.52 Many American, British, and German sources variously accused the Americans, British, German, or Japanese governments of secretly plotting to purchase the vessels.5354{{#tag:ref|Many contemporary sources reported the varying versions, including: &quot;British-Brazilian Warships,&quot; Navy, 11&lt;U+2013&gt;12; &quot;The Brazilian 'Dreadnoughts',&quot; Navy, 13&lt;U+2013&gt;14; &quot;Left Behind in Rio,&quot; Boston Evening Transcript, 25 January 1908, 2; &quot;Giant Ships for England or Japan,&quot; New York Herald, 1 July 1908, 9; &quot;Brazil, Japan, and Great Britain,&quot; Sun (New York), 1 July 1908, 6; &quot;The Brazilian Battleships,&quot; Japan Weekly Mail, 5 September 1908, 288; &quot;Germany May Buy English Warships,&quot; New York Times, 9 August 1908, C8; &quot;May Take Brazil's Ships, Day (New London), 19 March 1909, 7; &quot;The Race for Naval Supremacy,&quot; Nelson Evening Mail, 6 April 1909, 2.|group=upper-alpha}} The New York Times remarked:

The rumor is that the three warships ... ordered [in Britain] two years ago will be launched from English shores only to fly the German flag. It is asserted that these ships, which are named the Sao Paulo, the Minas Geras [sic] and the Rio de Janeiro, and all of which will be completed by next fall, will be conveyed to the German government on the payment of $30,000,000.


It may be recalled that when orders were placed for the ships ... there was much speculation as to the destiny of the vessels, as no naval expert could understand how a second-rate power like Brazil needed such formidable engines of war which would represent absolutely the latest stages of naval construction and armament. Meanwhile, it had been reported that the ships were being built for the Japanese government, which had a secret understanding with Brazil. But this theory was soon discarded by the fact that relations between these two countries were not extremely cordial on account of the attitude of Brazil toward the immigration of Japanese laborers.{{#tag:ref|cf. Japanese Brazilian. A series of rumors supporting this theory, where Brazil was alleged to have placed large armament orders in the United Kingdom on behalf of Japan for use against the United States, was strongly denied by the Brazilian government. Rio Branco, through a telegram sent to the Brazilian ambassador to the United States Joaquim Nabuco, based his counter-argument in the close relationship between Brazilian and American governments, saying &quot;The old and cordial friendship between our countries is known, as well as the excellent relations existing between their governments. ... Every sensible person will understand that an honest and respectable government would not lead itself to play the part attributed to Brazil by the inventor of the news.&quot;55|group=upper-alpha}} Then it was semi-officially stated that the ships would never leave the ways except to fly the British flag, but the money for such a purpose could only be raised by a loan or the Admiralty getting the sum from the sinking fund&lt;U+2014&gt;contingencies which would naturally become public property long before they could be carried out. (&quot;Germany May Buy English Warships,&quot; New York Times, 9 August 1908, C8)

On the other side of the Atlantic, in the midst of the early 20th century naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany, members of the British House of Commons fretted over the battleships' possible destinations, though the Admiralty consistently stated that they did not believe any sale would occur. In mid-July and September 1908, the Commons discussed purchasing the ships to bolster the Royal Navy and ensure they would not be sold to a foreign rival, which would disrupt the British naval plan set in place by the &quot;Two-power Standard&quot;, though in March and late July 1908, the Brazilian government officially denied any sale was planned.5657 In March 1909, the British press and House of Commons began pushing for more dreadnoughts after the First Lord of the Admiralty, Reginald McKenna, asserted that Germany had stepped up its building schedule and would complete thirteen dreadnoughts in 1911&lt;U+2014&gt;four more than previously estimated. Naturally, the subject of purchasing the Brazilian dreadnoughts already being built was brought up, and McKenna had to officially deny that the government was planning to tender an offer for the warships.58 He also stated that a sale to a foreign power would be inconsequential, as &quot;our present superiority in strength in 1909&lt;U+2013&gt;10 is so great that no alarm would be created in the mind of the Board of Admiralty.&quot;59
Response: Argentina and Chile's dreadnought orders

 Argentina and Chile were alarmed by the Brazilian move, and they quickly moved to nullify the 1902 agreement which restricted their navies.60{{#tag:ref|While Argentina's principal concern was with Brazil, Chile also wished to respond to a recent Peruvian cruiser order (the Almirante Grau class).61|group=upper-alpha}} In November 1906—before the Brazilian battleships were canceled in favor of dreadnoughts—Argentina's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Manuel Augusto Montes de Oca, remarked that any one of the new Brazilian vessels could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets.62 Certainly by 1910, either Brazilian dreadnought was much more powerful than any single vessel in the Argentinian fleet.63 Fearful of a Brazilian–Chilean alliance, the Argentine government paid particular attention to the two countries' communications. de Oca's successor, Estanisl&lt;U+00E1&gt;o Zeballos, was a major factor in watching the two. In June 1908, he presented a plan to the Congress where the Argentines wold offer the Brazilian government a chance to give one of their two dreadnoughts then building to Argentina to maintain naval parity between the two countries. Should they have refused, the Argentine government would have given their Brazilian counterparts an ultimatum: if in eight days they did not comply, the mobilized Argentine Army would invade what Zeballos claimed was an defenseless Rio de Janeiro. Unfortunately for Zeballos, the plans were leaked to the media; the public outcry from details first published in the newspaper La Naci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n were enough to halt the plan and ensure Zeballos' resignation.64{{#tag:ref|The end of Zeballos' tenure as Foreign Minister was extremely contentious, as another controversy closely linked to him began shortly after his resignation. In Zeballos' last days as minister, a now-famous Telegram no. 9, sent from the Brazilian government to their representatives in Chile, was intercepted by the Argentine government and decoded. It was read in a congressional session a day after Zeballos' departure, where the new Minister of Foreign Affairs claimed it was proof of intended Brazilian aggression against Argentina. The full contents of the telegram were released by Zeballos to the press, which kindled international disenchantment with Brazil. However, in a public relations coup, Rio Branco released the cipher and actual full contents of the wrongly decoded telegram, proving it contained no reference to belligerent Brazilian intents on Argentina. Zeballos was later accused of deliberately distorting or forging the telegram. Whatever his culpability, his actions in that June may have been motivated by a personal vendetta against Rio Branco, who had bested Zeballos on several occasions since 1875, most notably during a border dispute arbitrated by American President Grover Cleveland (the Question of Palms, or Quest&lt;U+00E3&gt;o de Palmas).65|group=upper-alpha}}
to the possible effect on the country's large export trade, as a Brazilian blockade of the entrance to the R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o de la Plata would cripple the Argentine economy. The acquisition of dreadnoughts to maintain an equal footing with Brazil would, in the words of the Argentine admiral in charge of overseeing the Argentine dreadnoughts while under construction, avoid a &quot;preponderance of power on the other side, where a sudden gust of popular feeling or injured pride might make [a blockade] a dangerous weapon against us.&quot;66
Both countries faced difficulty in financing their own dreadnoughts. Although in Argentina the ruling National Autonomist Party supported the purchases, they initially faced public resistance for such expensive acquisitions.67 An influx of inflammatory newspaper editorials supporting new dreadnoughts, especially from La Prensa, and renewed border disputes, particularly Brazilian assertions that the Argentines were attempting to restore the Viceroyalty of the R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o de la Plata, swayed the public to support the purchases.68697071 The Argentine President, Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Figueroa Alcorta, attempted to ease the tensions with a message warning the Brazilians of a naval arms race should they continue on their present course. The Brazilian government replied with reasoning similar to Pena's speech in 1906, in that they believed the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated equipment left by the long-term neglect of the Brazilian Navy, and they repeatedly insisted that the ships were not meant for use against Argentina.7273 A bill authorizing the Argentine Navy to acquire three dreadnoughts was passed by the Chamber of Deputies in August,747576 but it was defeated in the Senate in November after the Congress passed an arbitration treaty and made a last-ditch offer to purchase one of the two Brazilian dreadnoughts currently being constructed.777879 The Brazilian government declined, so the bill was reintroduced and passed by the Senate on 17 December 1908 with forty-nine in support to thirteen opposed, over socialist objections that the country needed to be populated and the large sum of money could be better spent in other areas of the government.80818283
After the Argentine government sent a naval delegation to Europe to solicit and evaluate armament companies' offers,84 they received tenders from fifteen shipyards in five countries (the United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy), and conducted a drawn-out bidding process. The Argentine delegation rejected all of the bids twice, each time recycling the best technical aspects of the tendered designs when crafting new bidding requirements.85 The reason given for the first rejection was the appearance of the first super-dreadnought, HMS Orion.86 Still, the shipbuilders were furious, as the process of designing a major warship took large amounts of time and money,87 and they believed the Argentine tactic revealed their individual trade secrets.88 A British naval architect published a scathing condemnation of the Argentine tactics, albeit only after the contracts were not awarded to a British company:

We may assume that the British battleships embody good ideas and good practice&lt;U+2014&gt;in all probability the very best. These cannot fail, in a greater or less degree, to become part of the design which the British shipbuilder first submits to the Argentine Government. In the second inquiry it may be presumed that everything that was good in the first proposals had been seized upon by the Argentine authorities and asked for in the new design. This second request went not only to British builders but to all the builders of the world, and in this way it is exceedingly probable that a serious leakage of ideas and practice of our ships was disseminated through the world by the Argentine government. ... The third inquiry that was issued showed to all the builders of the world what has been eliminated or modified in the second inquiry; and so the process of leakage went merrily on, and with it that of the education of foreign builders and the Argentine government. (John H. Biles, &quot;Argentina,&quot; Navy [Washington] 4, no. 7 [1910]: 30, in Robert Scheina, Latin America: A Naval History, 1810&lt;U+2013&gt;1987 [Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1987], 84)

The United States' Fore River Shipbuilding Company tendered the lowest bid&lt;U+2014&gt;in part due to the availability of cheap steel, though they were accused of quoting an unprofitable price so the ships could act as loss leaders&lt;U+2014&gt;and was awarded the contract.8990 This aroused further suspicion in the European bidders, who had believed that the United States was not a real contender, although Argentina did order twelve destroyers from British, French, and German shipyards. The Times (London) editorialized that the American government had heavily misused their diplomatic influence in directing the contracts to Fore River, and accused the company of obscenely lowering their price.91
 The Argentine contract included an option for a third dreadnought in case the Brazilian government adhered to its contractual obligations to order a third dreadnought. Two newspapers, La Prensa and La Argentina, heavily advocated for a third ship; the latter even started a petition to raise money for a new battleship.92 The American minister to Argentina, Charles H. Sherrill, cabled back to the United States that &quot;this newspaper rivalry promises the early conclusion of a movement which means a third battleship whether by public subscription or by Government funds.&quot;93 On 31 December 1910, the Argentine government decided against constructing the ship,94 after Roque S&lt;U+00E1&gt;enz Pe&lt;U+00F1&gt;a, who had been making entreaties to Brazil to end the expensive naval race, was elected to the Presidency.95 In addition, the intended target of the third Argentine dreadnought, the third Brazilian dreadnought, had already been canceled multiple times.96{{#tag:ref|The third dreadnought, which was provided for in the original contract and would have been named Rio de Janeiro, was laid down on 16 March 1910. As the ship had already been eclipsed by new naval technology (chiefly the advent of super-dreadnoughts, beginning with the British Orion), the Brazilian government canceled her on 7 May and asked Armstrong to prepare a new design. The new contract was signed in October, but by November a new naval minister was appointed who had a different design in mind. cf. Third stage: additional Brazilian dreadnoughts.97|group=upper-alpha}}
Chile delayed her naval plans after a financial depression brought on by the 1906 Valpara&lt;U+00ED&gt;so earthquake and a drastic fall in the nitrate market in 1907.98 Money for a naval building program was only allocated in 1910.99 Although the Chilean government solicited bids from several armament companies, nearly all believed that a British company would win the contract; the American naval attach&lt;U+00E9&gt; opined that without anything short of a revolution the contracts were destined for the United Kingdom. The Chilean Navy had cultivated extensive ties with the United Kingdom's Royal Navy since the 1830s, when Chilean naval officers were given places on British ships to receive training and experience they could bring back to their country. This relationship had recently been cemented when a British naval mission was requested by Chile and sent in 1911.100 Still, the American and German governments attempted to swing sentiment to their side, and dispatched naval vessels to Chilean ports. Their efforts were futile, and the design tendered by Armstrong Whitworth was chosen and awarded on 25 July 1911.101
Other South American navies were in no state to respond. The Peruvian Navy, fourth-largest on the continent, had been decimated during the naval campaign of the War of the Pacific (1879–83). The problem was compounded by not purchasing ships after the war, so that a pair of scout cruisers delivered in 1906 and 1907, Almirante Grau and Coronel Bolognesi, were the first new warships acquired since the war. They were augmented by two submarines and a destroyer ordered from France. With little expertise in operating any kind of modern warship, let alone a dreadnought, Peru was far from joining the naval race. Their highest aspirations were for the obsolete French armored cruiser Dupuy de L&lt;U+00F4&gt;me, which they partially paid for but never bought. The rest of the South American navies had never operated large warships, though many added ships to their naval forces in the same time period. The Uruguayan Navy bought a  gunboat in 1910, while the Ecuadorian Navy's largest warships were two avisos and one torpedo boat, all around , and the Venezuelan Navy bought one ex-Spanish  protected cruiser, Mariscal Sucre, from the United States in 1912.102
Construction and trials of the new warships
 Brazil's Minas Geraes, the lead ship, was laid down by Armstrong on 17 April 1907, while her sister ship S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo followed thirteen days later at Vickers. Construction of the partial hull needed to launch Minas Geraes was delayed by a four-month strike to 10 September 1908, and S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo followed on 19 April 1909.103104105106107 Both were christened in front of large crowds by the wife of Francisco R&lt;U+00E9&gt;gis de Oliveira, the Brazilian ambassador to the United Kingdom.108109 After multiple trials of the speed, endurance, efficiency, and weaponry of the ship,110111 Minas Geraes was completed and handed over to Brazil on 5 January 1910.112 S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo followed in July, after her own trials.113114
Argentina's Rivadavia was built by Fore River at its shipyard in Massachusetts, and as called for in the final contract, Moreno was subcontracted out to the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of New Jersey.115 The steel for the ships was largely supplied by the Bethlehem Steel Company of Pennsylvania.116 Rivadavia was laid down on 25 May 1910—one hundred years after the establishment of the first independent Argentine government, the Primera Junta—and launched on 26 August 1911.117118 Moreno was laid down on 10 July 1910 and launched on 23 September 1911.119120 Construction on both ships took longer than usual, and there were further delays during their sea trials when one of Rivadavia{{'}}s turbines was damaged and one of Moreno{{'}}s turbines failed.121122123 The two were only officially completed in December 1914 and February 1915.124125 Even the departure of Moreno was marked by mishaps, as the ship sank a barge and ran aground twice.126127128
Chile's Almirante Latorre was launched on 27 November 1913.129130{{#tag:ref|Scheina gives 17 November as the launching date, though this appears to be a typographical error.131|group=upper-alpha}} After the First World War broke out in Europe, work on Almirante Latorre was halted in August 1914,132 and she was formally purchased on 9 September after the British Cabinet recommended it four days earlier.133134135136 Almirante Latorre was not forcibly seized like the Ottoman Reshadieh and Sultan Osman I (ex-Rio de Janeiro), two other ships being built for a foreign navy, because of Chile's &quot;friendly neutral&quot; status with the United Kingdom which the British needed to maintain due to their dependence on Chilean nitrate imports, which were vital to the British armament industry.137 The former Chilean ship was completed on 30 September 1915,138 commissioned into the Royal Navy on 15 October, and served in that navy in the First World War.139 Work on the other battleship, Almirante Cochrane, was halted after the outbreak of war. The British purchased her on 28 February 1918 to be converted to an aircraft carrier, as the partially completed ship was the only available large and fast hull capable of being modified into a carrier without major reconstruction. Low priority and quarrels with shipyard workers slowed completion of the ship; she was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Eagle in 1924.140
Third stage: another Brazilian dreadnought

After the first Brazilian dreadnought, Minas Geraes, was launched, the Brazilian government began an extended campaign to remove the third dreadnought from the contract due to political&lt;U+2014&gt;relations with Argentina were warming&lt;U+2014&gt;and economic reasons. After much negotiating and attempts from Armstrong to hold the Brazilian government to the contract, the Brazilians relented, due in part to lower bond rates that made it possible for the government to borrow the necessary money. Rio de Janeiro was laid for the first time in March 1910.141
By May, the Brazilian government asked Armstrong to stop work on the new warship and to submit new designs which took in the most recent advance in naval technology, super-dreadnoughts. Eustace Tennyson-d'Eyncourt served as Armstrong's liaison to Brazil. Originally, the dreadnought was going to mount twelve 14-inch guns, but the many requests made by the Brazilian Navy for minor changes delayed the contract signing until 10 October 1910. The battleship's keel laying was delayed further by a labor dispute with the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights, which led to a lockout. During these delays, a new Minister of the Navy, Admiral Marques Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o, was appointed to replace de Alencar&lt;U+2014&gt;an important development, as the contract stipulated that the design could only proceed with the approval of the new Minister. Again, however, the Brazilian Navy found itself torn between two schools of thought: Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o and others in the navy favored a reversion to the 12-inch gun, but others, led by the outgoing Minister of the Navy (de Alencar) and the head of the Brazilian naval commission in the United Kingdom (Rear Admiral Duarte Huet de Bacellar Pinto Guedes), were strongly in favor of obtaining the ship with the largest armament&lt;U+2014&gt;in this case, a design drawn up by Bacellar, carrying eight 16-inch guns, six 9.4-inch guns, and fourteen 6-inch guns.142
 D'Eyncourt, who had departed Brazil in October immediately after the contract was signed, returned in March 1911 to display the various design options available to the Brazilian Navy. Armstrong evidently thought the second faction would prevail, so he also took with him everything needed to close a deal on Bacellar's design. By mid-March, Armstrong's contacts in Brazil reported that Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o had convinced the President to cancel the design with twelve 14-inch guns in favor of a smaller ship.143 The credit may not have laid with Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o alone, though. By March 1911, the Brazilian president was dealing with the aftermath of a large naval revolt in November 1910 (the Revolt of the Lash)&lt;U+2014&gt;led by crewmen on the two new Minas Geraes-class dreadnoughts his navy had just purchased&lt;U+2014&gt;and worsening government debt compounded by budget deficits. Brazil's external and internal debt would reach $500 and $335 million (respectively) by 1913, partly through rising deficits—$22 million in 1908, continuing to $47 million by 1912.144145 In May, he commented negatively on the new ship:

When I assumed office, I found that my predecessor had signed a contract for the building of the battleship Rio de Janeiro, a vessel of 32,000 tons, with an armament of 14 in. guns. Considerations of every kind pointed to the inconvenience of acquiring such a vessel and to the revision of the contract in the sense of reducing the tonnage. This was done, and we shall possess a powerful unit which will not be built on exaggerated lines such as have not as yet stood the time of experience. (President Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca, 3 May 1911, in Robert Scheina, Latin America: A Naval History, 1810&lt;U+2013&gt;1987 [Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1987], 354)

D'Eyncourt probably avoided proposing any design with 16-inch guns when he saw the political situation. In meetings with Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o, designs of only ten 12-inch guns mounted on the centerline were quickly rejected, even though their broadside was as strong as that of the Minas Geraes class, but a design with no less than fourteen 12-inch guns emerged as the frontrunner. Author David Topliss attributes this to political necessity, as he believed the Minister of the Navy could not validate purchasing a seemingly less-powerful dreadnought than the Minas Geraes class: with larger guns ruled out, the only remaining choice was a larger number of guns.146
After numerous requests for design alterations from the Brazilian Navy were accommodated or rejected, a contract was signed for a ship with fourteen 12-inch guns on 3 June 1911 for &lt;U+00A3&gt;2,675,000, and Rio de Janeiro{{'}}s keel was laid for the fourth time on 14 September. It did not take long for the Brazilian government to reconsider their decision again;147 by mid-1912, battleships with 14-inch guns were under construction, and suddenly it seemed that Rio de Janeiro would be outclassed upon completion.148 Making matters worse, a European depression after the end of the Second Balkan War in August 1913 reduced Brazil's ability to obtain foreign loans. This coincided with a collapse in Brazil's coffee and rubber exports, the latter due to the loss of the Brazilian rubber monopoly to British plantations in the Far East. The price of coffee declined by 20% and Brazilian exports of it dropped 12.5% between 1912 and 1913; rubber saw a similar decline of 25 and 36.6%, respectively.149
Armstrong studied whether replacing the 12-inch guns with seven 15-inch guns would be feasible, but Brazil was probably already attempting to sell the ship. In the tension building up to the First World War, plenty of countries, including Russia, Italy, France, Greek, and the Ottoman Empire, were willing to purchase the ship. Russia and Italy dropped out, and Greece made an offer for the original purchase price plus an additional &lt;U+00A3&gt;50,000. As they worked to obtain the money, the Ottomans, with a loan from a French banker independent of his government, were able to secure the ship as-is for &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,200,000 on 29 December 1913. As part of the purchase contract, the remainder of the ship was constructed with Ottoman money. Renamed Sultan Osman I, she was eventually taken over by the British shortly after the beginning of the First World War, serving with the Royal Navy as HMS Agincourt.150
The Argentine government authorized a third dreadnought in October 1912 in case Rio de Janeiro was completed and delivered, but the ship was never named or built.151
Decline and end of the arms race
Riachuelo
After selling Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian government asked Armstrong and Vickers to prepare more designs for a new battleship. They replied with at least fourteen designs, six from Vickers (December 1913 through March 1914) and eight from Armstrong (February 1914). Vickers' designs varied between eight and ten 15-inch and eight 16-inch guns, with speeds between 22 and 25 knots (the lower-end ships having mixed firing, the higher using oil), and displacements between  and . Armstrong took two basic designs, one with eight and the other with ten 15-inch guns, and varied their speed and firing.152{{#tag:ref|Topliss (1985), in writing a design history of the four Brazilian dreadnoughts, makes no mention of Vanterpool's (1969) article, which detailed four substantially different designs prepared in October 1913 by Armstrong. Sturton (1970), whose article was written in direct reply to Vanterpool, found that designs were submitted after that date and that one, bearing little resemblance to anything uncovered by Vanterpool, was ordered. Topliss, on whose research this paragraph is largely based, appears to have expanded upon Sturton's work, but does not include the designs detailed by Vanterpool, even though his article is listed in Topliss' sources.|group=upper-alpha}} The Brazilian government chose what was labeled as Design 781, the first of the eight 15-inch designs tendered by Armstrong, which also shared characteristics with the Queen Elizabeth and es then being built for the United Kingdom.153154
The Brazilian government placed an order for one ship of this design, to be named Riachuelo, at the Armstrong Whitworth shipyard in Elswick on 12 May 1914.155156{{#tag:ref|Most sources do not mention that Brazil ordered a battleship;157 Conway's even remarks that &quot;Brazil had not selected from the four design variations&quot;.158|group=upper-alpha}} Some preliminary work was completed for Riachuelo, but the ship's keel had not been laid by the time the United Kingdom declared war on the Central Powers in August 1914, and Riachuelo was never constructed.159
Attempted sales
After Rio de Janeiro was sold to the Ottoman Empire, the Argentine government bowed to popular demand and began to seek a buyer for their two dreadnoughts. The money received in return would be devoted to internal improvements. Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the Argentine National Congress in mid-1914, but all were defeated. Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Ottoman, Italian, and Grecian governments were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of Rio de Janeiro.160161162 The New-York Tribune reported that the Argentine government rejected a $17.5 million offer for Moreno alone, which would have netted them a large profit over the original construction cost of the ships ($12 million).163 The United States, worried that its neutrality would not be respected and its technology would be released for study to a foreign country, put diplomatic pressure on the Argentine government to keep the ships, which it eventually did.164
In each of the countries involved in the South American dreadnought arms race, movements arose that advocated the sale of the dreadnoughts to devote the money toward more worthy pursuits.165 The costs for the ships were rightfully viewed as enormous. After the Minas Geraes class was ordered, a Brazilian newspaper equated the initial purchase cost for the three ships as equaling 3,125 miles of railroad tracks or 30,300 homesteads. Naval historian Robert Scheina put the price at &lt;U+00A3&gt;6,110,100 without accounting for ammunition, which was &lt;U+00A3&gt;605,520, or necessary upgrades to docks, which was &lt;U+00A3&gt;832,000. Costs for maintenance and related issues, which in the first five years of Minas Geraes{{'}}s and S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo{{'}}s commissioned lives was about 60 percent of the initial cost, only added to the already staggering sum of money.166 The two Rivadavias were purchased for about a fifth of the Argentine government's yearly income, a figure which did not include the later in-service costs.167 Historian Robert K. Massie rounded the figure to a quarter of each government's annual income.168
In addition, the nationalistic sentiments that exacerbated the naval arms race had given way to slowing economies and growing public opinion that supported investing inside the country.169 Commenting on this, the United States' Minister to Chile, Henry Prather Fletcher, wrote to Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan: &quot;Since the naval rivalry began in 1910, financial conditions, which were none too good then, have grown worse; and as time approaches for the final payment, feeling has been growing in these countries that perhaps they are much more in need of money than of battleships.&quot;170
Post-war expansions
After the First World War, the dreadnought race never resumed, but many plans for post-war naval expansions and improvements were attempted by the Argentine, Brazilian, and Chilean governments. As part of an overall scheme to regain naval superiority in the region, the Argentines sent Rivadavia and Moreno to the United States in 1924 and 1926 to be modernized. Also, a large naval building program in support of this goal was launched in 1926, three cruisers (the Italian-built Veinticinco de Mayo class and the British-built ''La Argentina), twelve destroyers (the Spanish-built Churruca class and the British-built Mendoza/Buenos Aires classes), and three submarines (the Italian-built Santa Fe class) were acquired.171
The Brazilian government modernized Minas Geraes, S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo, and the two cruisers acquired under the 1904 plan, Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul, between 1918 and 1925.172 They also made plans to acquire additional ships in the 1920s and '30s, but both were sharply reduced from the original proposals. In 1924, a proposal for the construction of a relatively modest number of warships (a heavy cruiser, and five destroyers) and five submarines was floated. In the same year, the newly arrived American naval mission, led by Rear Admiral Carl Theodore Vogelgesang, tendered a naval expansion plan of 151,000 tons, divided between battleships (70,000), cruisers (60,000), destroyers (15,000), and submarines (6,000). The United States' State Department, led by Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes, was fresh from negotiating the Washington Naval Treaty and not keen on seeing another dreadnought race, so Hughes quickly moved to thwart the efforts of the mission. Only one Italian-built submarine, Humayt&lt;U+00E1&gt;, was acquired under this plan.173174175
Minas Geraes was modernized at the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard from June 1931 to 1938,176177{{#tag:ref|The 1938 date is somewhat variable, as the ship returned to active duty in 1938, but the modernization was not completed until 1940.178 Other sources give different dates for the modernization, such as 1934 to 1937.179180|group=upper-alpha}} but S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo{{'}}s poor material condition made any similar action uneconomical.181182 During the same period, the Brazilian government looked into purchasing cruisers from the United States Navy but ran into the restrictions of the Washington and London Naval Treaties, which prevented the sale of used warships to foreign countries. They also tried to purchase destroyers from the United States, but eventually contracted for six destroyers from the United Kingdom.{{#tag:ref|These were taken over after the beginning of the Second World War and became the Havant class.183|group=upper-alpha}} In the interim, a plan to lease six destroyers from the United States Navy was abandoned after it was met with strong opposition from both international and American institutions.184 Three Marcilio Dias-class destroyers, based on the American Mahan class, were laid down in Brazil with six minelayers, all of which were launched between 1939 and 1941. Though both programs required foreign assistance to complete and were consequently delayed by the war, all nine ships were completed by 1944.185
 Chile began to seek additional ships to bolster its fleet in 1919, and the United Kingdom eagerly offered many of its surplus warships. This action worried nearby nations, who feared that a Chilean attempt to become the region's most powerful navy would destabilize the area and start another naval arms race.186187 Chile asked for Canada and Eagle, the two battleships they ordered before the war, but the cost of converting the latter back to a battleship was too high.188189 Planned replacements included the two remaining s, but a leak to the press of the secret negotiations to acquire them caused an uproar within Chile itself over the value of such ships.190 In the end, Chile only bought Canada and four destroyers in April 1920. All five had been ordered from British yards by the Chilean government before 1914, but were purchased by the Royal Navy after the British entered the First World War.191 All were obtained for comparatively low prices; Canada was sold for just &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,000,000, less than half of what had been required to construct the ship.192 The Chileans continued to acquire more ships from the British in the 1920s, adding six destroyers (the Serrano class), three submarines (the Capitan O'Brien class), and smaller ships in the late 1920s.193 Almirante Latorre was sailed to the United Kingdom in 1929 to be modernized at Devonport Dockyard, which was completed in 1931.194 Little progress was made during a recession in the early 1930s and a major naval revolt in 1931.195196 In the late 1930s, the Chilean government inquired into the possibility of constructing an  cruiser in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, or Sweden, but this did not lead to an order. A second plan to acquire two small cruisers was dropped with the beginning of the Second World War.197 Soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States attempted to purchase Almirante Latorre, two destroyers, and a submarine tender, but the offer was rejected.198199
At the beginning of the Second World War, the three major South American navies found themselves unable to acquire major warships. With the end, the United States and United Kingdom had many ships that were unnecessary or surplus to the requirements of their post-war navies. Still, the South American countries ran into political difficulties in acquiring anything larger than Flower-class corvettes and River-class frigates. The war had proved the obsolete status of battleships, so the navies were seeking cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, which they were finally able to acquire when the Red Scare began to strongly affect American and international politics. One of the deals reached under the Mutual Defense Assistance Act (1949) sold six American light cruisers to Argentina, Brazil, and Chile in January 1951.{{#tag:ref|Most of the cruisers transferred were from the Brooklyn class, but one of Brazil's cruisers (Almirante Tamandar&lt;U+00E9&gt;) was from the slightly improved St. Louis class.|group=upper-alpha}} While this bolstered the navies of important South American allies of the United States, which would be treaty-bound to assist the United States in any war, naval historian Robert Scheina argues that the American government also used the opportunity to significantly affect the traditional naval rivalry among the three countries:

While more than ninety percent of the aid provided under [the Mutual Defense Assistance Act] went to European and Asian countries, the United States, now the dominant foreign power in Latin America, used surplus ships as a tool to further mutual interests ... and reshape the Latin American naval panorama. Thus Argentina's pre-World War II formula that she had to possess a fleet equal in strength to the combined fleets of Brazil and Chile changed in one stroke to 1A = 1B = 1C. (Robert Scheina, Latin America: A Naval History, 1810&lt;U+2013&gt;1987 [Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1987], 173)

With the influx of relatively modern warships, the battleships of the three countries were sold for scrap in the 1950s. The Brazilian ships were disposed of first; S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo was sold in 1951, and was lost in a storm north of the Azores while being towed to her final destination.200201 Minas Geraes was sold two years later and broken up in Genoa beginning in 1954.202 Of the Argentine dreadnoughts, Rivadavia was scrapped in Italy beginning in 1959, while Moreno was brought to Japan in 1957.203 Almirante Latorre, inactive since 1951, followed Moreno to Japan in 1959.204205
Historiography
 The historiography, or works published on a specific topic, behind the South American dreadnought race is relatively small in number and coverage, especially in English. General maritime histories on the period (c. 1904&lt;U+2013&gt;14) avoid the area and focus on the traditional powers, especially the Anglo-German arms race. The more specific English-language works on the period that do cover South America tend to summarize the region's dreadnought race, focus on the ships built rather than their implications, or look at the closely related Revolt of the Lash (Revolta da Chibata). Seward Livermore, writing from Brown University, looked at the race about thirty years after its conclusion from an American perspective. This meant he gave emphasis to the Argentine order, the role of the American government in obtaining it, and the attempts to obtain the Chilean order. Livermore was mildly critical of the arms race for its destabilizing effects:

As a means of promoting closer cooperation or understanding between the two hemispheres the international armament business was of very dubious worth. The peddling of war material to small but quarrelsome nations was fraught with too many unpleasant and unpredictable consequences. Battleship diplomacy had been a novel departure in American statecraft; some material success had been achieved, but the net result, from the standpoint of the imponderable factors, was most unsatisfactorily disappointing. (Seward Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy in South America: 1905&lt;U+2013&gt;1925,&quot; Journal of Modern History 16, no. 1 (1944): 48)

British maritime historian Richard Hough, writing in 1966, remarked on the huge cost of the warships and expressed disbelief that the countries thought they could afford the ships in the first place, let alone maintain them as the years went by. He also wondered as to the original purpose of Brazil's ships, as in his view the relations between Brazil and its naval rivals, Argentina and Chile, were quite good given prior context. As Hough saw the situation, the only ones to gain from the whole arms race were the armament companies involved in the ships' construction.206
Robert Scheina, a Latin American naval historian, devoted a chapter of his 1987 book, Latin America: A Naval History, 1810&lt;U+2013&gt;1987, to the dreadnought race. Although this was one of the first comprehensive works on the topic of Latin American maritime history, it was criticized by some reviewers for trying to fit too much information into too short a space.207208 This shows in the dreadnought race's coverage, which was dwarfed by more recent events, especially the Falklands War (seven pages versus fifty-five).209 Still, Scheina included a small conclusion to the chapter, where he outlined 'lessons' learned by the three countries in the dreadnought race. Like Hough, he highlighted the exorbitant maintenance costs of the dreadnoughts. In addition, they were meant to be used against other dreadnoughts, but as soon as the traditional powers built dreadnoughts in large numbers, the ones owned by Argentina, Brazil, and Chile were much less of a threat. Last, Scheina pointed out the benefits of international attention, in the form of military alliances, brought by the dreadnoughts, but also noted that this resulted in the same outcome as lesson two&lt;U+2014&gt;as the years went on, the ships dwindled in importance.210
Brazilian historian Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Roberto Martins Filho utilized British and Brazilian archival material to focus on the Brazilian dreadnoughts in his Portuguese-language book, A Marinha Brasileira na Era dos Encoura&lt;U+00E7&gt;ados, 1895&lt;U+2013&gt;1910, or The Brazilian Navy in the Era of Dreadnoughts. He took a very different approach and demonstrated that the Brazilian Navy was not ready for the disruptive influence of modern vessels. By focusing on acquiring the powerful new dreadnoughts, rather than adequately training the huge amounts of manpower needed to crew the ships—a third of the entire navy—or the maintenance necessary to keep the dreadnoughts operational, the navy was without the ability to conduct serious operations soon after their delivery.211212213 In addition, he proposes that the dreadnoughts' modern conditions were not compatible with the liberal use of corporal punishment, which provided a crucial spark to the Revolt against the Lash.214
