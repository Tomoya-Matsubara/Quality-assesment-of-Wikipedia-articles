Nuu-chah-nulth also called Nootka, and T'aat'aaqsapa is a Wakashan languages Wakashan language spoken in the Pacific Northwest of North America, on the west coast of Vancouver Island from Barkley Sound to Quatsino Sound in British Columbia, by the Nuu-chah-nulth people. Nuu-chah-nulth is a Southern Wakashan languages Southern Wakashan language related to Nitinaht language Nitinaht and Makah language Makah. 

Kim 2003 estimates the number of Nuu-chah-nulth speakers at approximately 150200, while the 2001 Canadian census puts the figure at about 505. Linguists find the language fascinating because of its morphology linguistics morphological and phonology phonological complexity. 

It is the first language of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast to have documentary written materials describing it. In the 1780s George Vancouver Captains Vancouver, Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra Quadra, and other European explorers and traders frequented Nootka Sound and the other Nuu-chah-nulth communities, making reports of their voyages. From 18031805 John R. Jewitt, an English blacksmith, was held captive by chief Maquinna at Nootka Sound. He made an effort to learn the language, and in 1815 published a memoir with a brief glossary of its terms.

#Of the alveolar consonants, nasal and laterals are apico-alveolar while the rest are denti-alveolar.
#Glottalized resonants nasals and approximants are realized as resonants with pre-glottalization. They are arguably conceptuallyVague date=February 2010 the same as ejective consonants.
#IPA // is an Approximant consonant approximant, not a Fricative consonant fricative The International Phonetic Alphabet IPA does not have a unique symbol for this sound. This phoneme is more often epiglottal consonant epiglottal and functions phonologically as a Pharyngeal consonant pharyngeal stop.

The pharyngeal consonants developed from mergers of uvular sounds; IPA // derives from a merger of IPA // and IPA // which are now comparatively rare while IPA // came about from a merger of IPA /q/ and IPA /q/ which are now absent from the language.Harvcoltxt Carlson et al. 2001 p=277

In the environment of glottalized resonants as well as ejective and pharyngeal consonants, vowels can be laryngealized which often means creaky voice.

In general, syllable weight determines stress placement; short vowels followed by non-glottalized consonants and long vowels are heavy. In sequences where there are no heavy syllables or only heavy syllables, the first syllable is stressed.

Nuu-chah-nulth has phonemic short and long vowels. Traditionally, a third class of vowels, known as variable length vowels, is recognized. These are vowels that are long when they are found within the first two syllables of a word, and short elsewhere.

Vocabulary
The Nuu-chah-nulth language contributed many words to the vocabulary of the Chinook Jargon and it is believed that oceanic commerce and exchanges between the Nuu-chah-nulth and other Southern Wakashan speakers with the Chinookan-speaking peoples of the lower Columbia River led to the foundations of the trade jargon that became known as Chinook Jargon Chinook in later years. Nootkan words in Chinook Jargon include hiyu - many, from Nuu-chah-nulth for ten, siah - far, from the Nuu-chah-nulth for sky.

A dictionary of the language, with some 7,500 entries, was created after 15 years of research. It is based on both work with current speakers and notes from linguist Edward Sapir, taken almost a century ago. The dictionary, however, is a subject of controversy, with a number of Nuu-chah-nulth elders questioning the accuracy of the terminology, and the author's right to represent their language.
