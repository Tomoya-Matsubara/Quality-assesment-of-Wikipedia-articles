Tragia ramosa is a species of flowering plant in the euphorb family known by the common name branched noseburn. It is native to the southwestern and southcentral United States and northern Mexico, where it grows in scrub, woodland, and other desert and plateau habitat. It is a perennial herb growing mostly erect, measuring 10 to 30 centimeters in maximum height. It is covered in long, rough stinging hairs.1 The leaves have lance-shaped or oval blades with toothed edges which are borne on petioles. The plant is monoecious; its inflorescence contains a few male flowers and usually one female flower. The flowers lack petals but have green sepals. The female flower yields a small capsule.
