St Michael and All Angels Church, Mottram stands on Warhill overlooking the village of Mottram in Longdendale, Greater Manchester, England (). The church is a Grade II* listed building.1 It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield and the deanery of Mottram.2
History
The earliest evidence of a church on the site is in 1225 when clergy attached to the church were witnesses to local documents.3 There is a further reference to the church in a taxation document dated 1291.4 The present church dates from the end of the 15th century. A major restoration took place in 1854–55 by E. H. Shellard, during which the nave roof was raised.5
Structure
The church is built from local stone quarried from Tinsell-Norr6 in Perpendicular style.7 The plan consists of a west tower, a five-bay nave with clerestory, north and south aisles, a two-bay chancel and a south porch. At the east end of each aisle is a chapel.8 The north chapel is known as the Hollingworth Chapel and the south chapel is the Staley Chapel.9 The tower is in four stages with angled buttresses, a three-light west window above which is a clock face and two-light belfry openings. In one corner is a stair turret. At the top is a castellated parapet with crocketed corner finials.10
Fittings and furniture
The oldest item in the church is the barrel-shaped Norman font. Above the chancel arch are painted panels containing the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer and Creed, together with a painting of Moses and Aaron.11 The alabaster pulpit of 1885 is by H. Hems.12 The brass chandelier is dated 1755.13 The stained glass windows include one by Kempe dated 1917.14
The Hollingworth Chapel is now used as an organ gallery. The Staley Chapel contains two sandstone effigies which are thought to be those of Sir Ralph Staveley and his wife dating from the early 15th century. Also in the chapel is a white marble monument to Reginald Bretland who died in 1703.15 The ring is of eight bells which were cast in 1910 by John Taylor &amp; Co.16 The parish registers date from 1559 for marriages and burials and from 1562 for baptisms.17

In the churchyard is a sundial with a dial dated 1811. It consists of a stone shaft with a copper dial and a gnomon.18 It is listed Grade II.

The octagonal shaft stands on a stepped circular ashlar plinth. On its top is a cubical sundial with three copper faces.20 It is listed Grade II*.21
