Sat Thai (, also spelled Sart Thai) is a traditional Thai mid-year festival, held on the new moon at the end of the tenth lunar month. It has many features of animism, attributing souls or spirits to animals, plants and other entities.
Etymology
Sat ( or , RTGS 'Sat') comes from Pali , which means autumnal.1 It specifically refers to the season &quot;when the grain is in the ear&quot;: rice grain panicles droop as seed reaches full size and fills with milky starch in the days before harvest time. Fruits also are in the bud.
Sat Thai is known as such to differentiate it from the Ghost Festival, known in Thai as Sat Chin.
