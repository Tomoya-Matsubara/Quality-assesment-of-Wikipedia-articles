Reception
Rock Journalist Keith Valcourt stated on behalf of the Butcher Babies: &lt;U+201C&gt;The Hottest Band in the World&lt;U+201D&gt; in his review of a show. The Butcher Babies deliver a loud crashing blend of heavy metal, punk and thrash that recalls Pantera, adding their stage show embodies the horror antics of Alice Cooper and Rob Zombie. Carla and Heidi don&lt;U+2019&gt;t merely sing: they assault the crowd with a blinding flash of aggression and abuse. And the crowd loves them for it.&lt;U+201D&gt;2
