The Venetian National Party (Partito Nasiona&lt;U+0142&gt; Veneto, PNV) is a Venetist, libertarian and separatist political party active in Veneto, Lombardy and Friuli-Venezia Giulia.
The party was founded in 2007 and is led by Paolo Bernardini. The first congress of the party was held on 18 May 2008 in Castelfranco Veneto. Gianluca Busato was elected secretary of the party, whereas Paolo Bernardini was elected president.
2009 elections
In 2009 the PNV took part for the first time in a election, by presenting candidates and lists for the provincial elections in Padua and Venice,
According to the PNV, during the campaign members and supporters of the party experienced several interferences from the local Carabinieri. Gianluca Busato was 'invited' into a Carabinieri's station of Limena for an interrogation.1 On 13 May Stefano Venturato, candidate for President in Padua, started a hunger strike in order to protest against the misinformation of the local newspapers about the PNV and the interferences of the Italian police.2 Finally, on 14 May, the PNV's headquarters in Treviso were ransacked by Carabinieri.3
Ideology
The party campaigns for independence for the so-called Venetia, a country that would be composed of all the territories of the historical Republic of Venice, covering the current Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, some provinces of Lombardy (Brescia, Bergamo, Cremona and Mantova) and a portion of Trentino (see chart), in contrast with those Venetist parties, notably Liga Veneta&lt;U+2013&gt;Lega Nord, currently campaigning for federal reform.
The core principles of the PNV include: individual rights, including the right to life, private property and the pursuit of happiness (a clear reference to the United States Declaration of Independence); the refusal of any discrimination based on race, sex, religion, language, etc.; nonviolence, democratic legitimacy and the principle of non aggression; resepect of the international law, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and especially self-determination. The party proposes an independent Veneto, &quot;tolerant and open to Europe&quot; and takes example from the Scottish National Party, the Basque National Party, and Catalan nationalists.45 The PNV leader Bernardini is essentially a libertarian and the party reflects his political and economic views.6
