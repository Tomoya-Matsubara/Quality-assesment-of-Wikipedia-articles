The Shunzhi Emperor (Wade-Giles: Shun-chih Emperor; ; Manchu:  ijish&lt;U+016B&gt;n dasan h&lt;U+016B&gt;wangdi; Mongolian: Eyebeer Zasagch Khaan; 15 March 1638Â &lt;U+2013&gt; 5 February 1661), was the third emperor of the Qing dynasty and the first Qing (pronounced &quot;Ch'ing&quot;) emperor to rule over China, which he did from 1644 to 1661. A committee of Manchu princes chose him to succeed his father Hong Taiji (1592&lt;U+2013&gt;1643) in September 1643 when he was five years old. The princes also appointed two co-regents: Dorgon (1612&lt;U+2013&gt;1650), fourteenth son of Qing founder Nurhaci (1559&lt;U+2013&gt;1626), and Jirgalang (1599&lt;U+2013&gt;1655), one of Nurhaci's nephews, both of whom were members of the Qing imperial clan.
From 1643 to 1650, political power lay mostly in the hands of Dorgon. Under his leadership, the Qing conquered most of the territory of the fallen Ming dynasty (1368&lt;U+2013&gt;1644), chased Ming loyalist regimes deep into the southwestern provinces, and established the basis of Qing rule over China despite highly unpopular policies like the &quot;haircutting command&quot; of 1645, which forced Qing subjects to shave their forehead and braid their remaining hair into a queue like the Manchus. After Dorgon's death on the last day of 1650, the young monarch started to rule personally. He tried, with mixed success, to fight corruption and to reduce the political influence of the Manchu nobility. In the 1650s he faced a resurgence of Ming loyalist resistance, but by 1661 his armies had defeated the Qing's last enemies, seafarer Koxinga (1624&lt;U+2013&gt;1662) and the Prince of Gui (1623&lt;U+2013&gt;1662) of the Southern Ming, both of whom would succomb the following year. The Shunzhi emperor died at the age of 22 of smallpox, a highly contagious disease that was endemic in China, but against which the Manchus had no immunity. He was succeeded by his third son Xuanye, who had already survived smallpox, and who subsequently reigned for sixty years under the name of Kangxi. Because fewer documents have survived from the Shunzhi era than from later Qing reigns, the Shunzhi age is a relatively little-known period of Qing history.
&quot;Shunzhi&quot; was the name of this ruler's reign period in Chinese. This title had equivalents in Manchu and Mongolian because the Qing imperial family was Manchu, and ruled over many Mongol tribes that helped the Qing to conquer China. The emperor's personal name was Fulin, and the posthumous name by which he was worshipped at the Imperial Ancestral Temple was Shizu (Wade-Giles: Shih-tsu; Chinese: &lt;U+4E16&gt;&lt;U+7956&gt;).
Historical background

In the 1580s, when China was ruled by the Ming dynasty (1368&lt;U+2013&gt;1644), a number of Jurchen tribes lived northeast of Ming territory in the region that is now known as China's Northeast, or &quot;Manchuria.&quot;2 In a series of campaigns from the 1580s to the 1610s, Nurhaci (1559&lt;U+2013&gt;1626), the leader of the Jianzhou Jurchens, unified most Jurchen tribes under his rule.3 One of his most important reforms was to integrate Jurchen clans under flags of four different colors&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+2013&gt;yellow, white, red, and blue&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+2013&gt;each further subdivided into two to form an encompassing social and military system known as the Eight Banners.4 Nurhaci gave control of these Banners to his sons and grand-sons.5 Around 1612, Nurhaci renamed his clan Aisin Gioro (&quot;golden Gioro&quot;), both to distinguish his family from other Gioro lines and to allude to an earlier dynasty that had been founded by Jurchens, the Jin (&quot;golden&quot;) dynasty that had ruled northern China from 1115 to 1234.6 In 1616 Nurhaci formally announced the foundation of the &quot;Later Jin&quot; dynasty, effectively declaring his independence from the Ming.7 Over the next few years he wrested most major cities in Liaodong from Ming control.8 His string of victories ended in February 1626 at the siege of Ningyuan, where Ming commander Yuan Chonghuan defeated him with the help of recently acquired Portuguese cannon.9 Probably hurt during the battle, Nurhaci died a few months later.10
Nurhaci's son and successor Hong Taiji (1592&lt;U+2013&gt;1643) continued his father's state-building efforts: he concentrated power into his own hands, modeled the Later Jin's government institutions on Chinese ones, and integrated Mongol allies and surrendered Chinese troops into the Eight Banners.11 In 1629 he led an incursion to the outskirts of Beijing, during which he captured Chinese craftsmen who knew how to cast Portuguese cannon.12 In 1635 Hong Taiji renamed the Jurchens the &quot;Manchus,&quot; and in 1636 changed the name of his polity from &quot;Later Jin&quot; to &quot;Qing.&quot;13 After capturing the last remaining Ming cities in Liaodong, by 1643 the Qing was preparing to seize upon the struggling Ming dynasty, which was crumbling under the combined weight of financial bankruptcy, devastating epidemics, and large-scale bandit uprisings fed by widespread starvation.14
Becoming emperor
 When Hong Taiji died on 21 September 1643 without having named a successor, the fledgling Qing state faced a possibly serious crisis.15 Several contenders&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+2013&gt;namely Nurhaci's second and eldest surviving son Dai&lt;U+0161&gt;an, Nurhaci's fourteenth and fifteenth sons Dorgon and Dodo (both born to the same mother), and Hong Taiji's eldest son Hooge&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+2013&gt;started to vie for the throne.16 With his brothers Dodo and Ajige, Dorgon (31 years old) controlled the Plain and Bordered White Banners, Dai&lt;U+0161&gt;an (60) was in charge of the two Red Banners, whereas Hooge (34) had the loyalty of his father's two Yellow Banners.17
The decision about who would become the new Qing emperor fell to the Deliberative Council of Princes and Ministers, which was the Manchus' main policymaking body until the emergence of the Grand Council in the 1720s.18 Many Manchu princes advocated that Dorgon, a proven military leader, should become the new emperor, but Dorgon refused and insisted that one of Hong Taiji's sons should succeed his father.19 To recognize Dorgon's authority while keeping the throne in Hong Taiji's descent line, the members of the council named Hong Taiji's ninth son Fulin as the new Emperor, but decided that Dorgon and Jirgalang (a nephew of Nurhaci who controlled the Bordered Blue Banner) would act as the five-year-old child's regents.20 Fulin was officially crowned Emperor of the Qing dynasty on 8 October 1643; it was decided that he would reign under the era name &quot;Shunzhi.&quot;21 Because the Shunzhi reign is not well documented, it constitutes a relatively little-known period of Qing history.22
Dorgon's regency (1643&lt;U+2013&gt;1650)

Prince Regent Dorgon in imperial regalia. He reigned as a quasi emperor from 1643 to his death in 1650, a period during which the Qing conquered almost all of China.

A quasi emperor
On 17 February 1644, Jirgalang, who was a capable military leader but looked uninterested in managing state affairs, willingly yielded control of all official matters to Dorgon.23 After an alleged plot by Hooge to undermine the regency was exposed on 6 May of that year, Hooge was stripped of his title of Imperial Prince and his co-conspirators were executed.24 Dorgon soon replaced Hooge's supporters (mostly from the Yellow Banners) with his own, thus gaining closer control of two more Banners.25 By early June 1644, he was in firm control of the Qing government and its military.26
In early 1644, just as Dorgon and his advisors were pondering how to attack the Ming, peasant rebellions were dangerously approaching Beijing. On 24 April of that year, rebel leader Li Zicheng breached the walls of the Ming capital, pushing the Chongzhen Emperor to hang himself on a hill behind the Forbidden City.27 Hearing the news, Dorgon's Chinese advisors Hong Chengchou and Fan Wencheng (&lt;U+8303&gt;&lt;U+6587&gt;&lt;U+7A0B&gt;; 1597&lt;U+2013&gt;1666) urged the Manchu prince to seize this opportunity to present themselves as avengers of the fallen Ming and to claim the Mandate of Heaven for the Qing.28 The last obstacle between Dorgon and Beijing was Ming general Wu Sangui, who was garrisoned at Shanhai Pass at the eastern end of the Great Wall.29 Himself caught between the Manchus and Li Zicheng's forces, Wu requested Dorgon's help in ousting the bandits and restoring the Ming.30 When Dorgon asked Wu to work for the Qing instead, Wu had little choice but to accept.31 Aided by Wu Sangui's elite soldiers, who fought the rebel army for hours before Dorgon finally chose to intervene with his cavalry, the Qing won a decisive victory against Li Zicheng at the Battle of Shanhai Pass on 27 May.32 Li's defeated troops looted Beijing for several days until Li left the capital on 4 June with all the wealth he could carry.33
Settling in the capital

The circular mound of the Altar of Heaven, where the Shunzhi emperor conducted sacrifices on 30 October 1644, ten days before being officially proclaimed Emperor of China. The ceremony marked the moment when the Qing dynasty seized the Mandate of Heaven.

After six weeks of mistreatment at the hands of rebel troops, the Beijing population sent a party of elders and officials to greet their liberators on 5 June.34 They were startled when, instead of meeting Wu Sangui and the Ming heir apparent, they saw Dorgon, a horseriding Manchu with his shaved forehead, present himself as the Prince Regent.35 In the midst of this upheaval, Dorgon installed himself in the Wuying Palace (&lt;U+6B66&gt;&lt;U+82F1&gt;&lt;U+6BBF&gt;), the only building that remained more or less intact after Li Zicheng had set fire to the palace complex on 3 June.36 Banner troops were ordered not to loot; their discipline made the transition to Qing rule &quot;remarkably smooth.&quot;37 Yet at the same time as he claimed to have come to avenge the Ming, Dorgon ordered that all claimants to the Ming throne (including descendants of the last Ming emperor) should be executed along with their supporters.38
On June 7, just two days after entering the city, Dorgon issued special proclamations to officials around the capital, assuring them that if the local population accepted to shave their forehead, wear a queue, and surrender, the officials would be allowed to stay at their post.39 He had to repeal this command three weeks later after several peasant rebellions erupted around Beijing, threatening Qing control over the capital region.40
Dorgon greeted Shunzhi at the gates of Beijing on 19 October 1644.41 On 30 October the six-year-old monarch performed sacrifices to Heaven and Earth at the Altar of Heaven.42 A formal ritual of enthronement for Fulin was held on 8 November, during which the young emperor compared Dorgon's achievements to those of the Duke of Zhou, a revered regent from antiquity.43 During the ceremony, Dorgon's official title was raised from &quot;Prince Regent&quot; to &quot;Uncle Prince Regent&quot; (Shufu shezheng wang &lt;U+53D4&gt;&lt;U+7236&gt;&lt;U+651D&gt;&lt;U+653F&gt;&lt;U+738B&gt;), in which the Manchu term for &quot;Uncle&quot; (ecike) represented a rank higher than that of imperial prince.44 Three days later Dorgon's co-regent Jirgalang was demoted from &quot;Prince Regent&quot; to &quot;Assistant Uncle Prince Regent&quot; (Fu zheng shuwang &lt;U+8F14&gt;&lt;U+653F&gt;&lt;U+53D4&gt;&lt;U+738B&gt;).45 In June 1645, Dorgon eventually decreed that all official documents should refer to him as &quot;Imperial Uncle Prince Regent&quot; (Huang shufu shezheng wang &lt;U+7687&gt;&lt;U+53D4&gt;&lt;U+7236&gt;&lt;U+651D&gt;&lt;U+653F&gt;&lt;U+738B&gt;), which left him one step short of claiming the throne for himself.46
 One of Dorgon's first orders in the new Qing capital was to vacate the entire northern part of Beijing to give it to Bannermen. The Yellow Banners were given the place of honor north of the palace, followed by the White Banners east, the Red Banners west, and the Blue Banners south.47 This distribution accorded with the order established in the Manchu homeland before the conquest and under which &quot;each of the banners was given a fixed geographical location according to the points of the compass.&quot;48 Despite tax remissions and large-scale building programs designed to facilitate the transition, in 1648 many Chinese civilians still lived among the newly arrived Banner population and there was still animosity between the two groups.49 Agricultural land outside the capital was also marked off (quan &lt;U+5708&gt;) and given to Qing troops.50 Former landowners now became tenants who had to pay rent to their absentee Bannermen landlords.51 This transition in land use caused &quot;several decades of disruption and hardship.&quot;52
In 1646, Dorgon also ordered that the civil examinations for selecting government officials be reestablished. From then on they were held regularly every three years as under the Ming. In the very first palace examination held under Qing rule in 1646, candidates, most of whom were northern Chinese, were asked how the Manchus and Han Chinese could be made to work together for a common purpose.53 The 1649 examination inquired about &quot;how Manchus and Han Chinese could be unified so that their hearts were the same and they worked together without division.&quot;54 Under the Shunzhi reign the average number of graduates per session of the metropolitan examination was the highest of the Qing dynasty (&quot;to win more Chinese support&quot;), until 1660 when lower quotas were established.55
The conquest of China



A late-Qing woodblock print representing the Yangzhou massacre of May 1645. Dorgon's brother Dodo ordered this massacre to scare other southern Chinese cities into submission. By the late nineteenth century the massacre was used by anti-Qing revolutionaries to arouse anti-Manchu sentiment among the Han Chinese population.56

Under the reign of Dorgon&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+2013&gt;whom historians have variously called &quot;the mastermind of the Qing conquest&quot; and &quot;the principal architect of the great Manchu enterprise&quot;&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+2013&gt;the Qing subdued almost all of China and pushed loyalist &quot;Southern Ming&quot; resistance into the far southwestern reaches of China. After repressing anti-Qing revolts in Hebei and Shandong in the Summer and Fall of 1644, Dorgon sent armies to root out Li Zicheng from the important city of Xi'an (Shaanxi province), where Li had reestablished his headquarters after fleeing Beijing in early June 1644.57 Under the pressure of Qing armies, Li was forced to leave Xi'an in February 1645, and he was killed&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+2013&gt;either by his own hand or by a peasant group that had organized for self-defense in this time of rampant banditry&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+2013&gt;in September 1645 after fleeing though several provinces.58
From newly captured Xi'an, in early April 1645 the Qing mounted a campaign against the rich commercial and agricultural region of Jiangnan south of the lower Yangtze River, where in June 1644 a Ming imperial prince had established a regime loyal to the Ming.59 Factional bickering and numerous defections prevented the Southern Ming from mounting an efficient resistance.60 Several Qing armies swept south, taking the key city of Xuzhou north of the Huai River in early May 1645 and soon converging on Yangzhou, the main city on the Southern Ming's northern line of defense.61 Bravely defended by Shi Kefa, who refused to surrender, Yangzhou fell to Manchu artillery on 20 May after a one-week siege.62 Dorgon's brother Prince Dodo then ordered the slaughter of Yangzhou's entire population.63 As intended, this massacre terrorized other Jiangnan cities into surrendering to the Qing.64 Indeed Nanjing surrendered without a fight on 16 June after its last defenders had made Dodo promise he would not hurt the population.65 The Qing soon captured the Ming emperor (who died in Beijing the following year) and seized Jiangnan's main cities, including Suzhou and Hangzhou; by early July 1645, the frontier between the Qing and the Southern Ming had been pushed south to the Qiantang River.66

A man in San Francisco's Chinatown around 1900. The Chinese habit of wearing a queue came from Dorgon's July 1645 edict ordering all men to shave their forehead and tie their hair into a queue like the Manchus.

On 21 July 1645, after Jiangnan had been superficially pacified, Dorgon issued a most inopportune edict ordering all Chinese men to shave their forehead and to braid the rest of their hair into a queue just like the Manchus.67 The punishment for non-compliance was death.68 This policy of symbolic submission helped the Manchus in telling friend from foe.69 For Han officials and literati, however, the new hairstyle was shameful and demeaning (because it breached a common Confucian directive to preserve one's body intact), whereas for common folk cutting their hair was the same as losing their virility.70 Because it united Chinese of all social backgrounds into resistance against Qing rule, the haircutting command greatly hindered the Qing conquest.71 The defiant population of Jiading and Songjiang was massacred by former Ming general Li Chengdong (&lt;U+674E&gt;&lt;U+6210&gt;&lt;U+6771&gt;; d. 1649), respectively on August 24 and September 22.72 Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Qing troops for 83 days. When the city wall was finally breached on 9 October 1645, the Qing army led by Ming defector Liu Liangzuo (&lt;U+5289&gt;&lt;U+826F&gt;&lt;U+4F50&gt;; d. 1667) massacred the entire population, killing between 74,000 and 100,000 people.73 These massacres ended armed resistance against the Qing in the Lower Yangtze.74 A few committed loyalists became hermits, hoping that for lack of military success, their withdrawal from the world would at least symbolize their continued defiance against foreign rule.75
After the fall of Nanjing, two more members of the Ming imperial household created new Southern Ming regimes: one centered in coastal Fujian around the &quot;Longwu Emperor&quot; Zhu Yujian, Prince of Tang&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+2013&gt;a ninth-generation descendant of Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+2013&gt;and one in Zhejiang around &quot;Regent&quot; Zhu Yihai, Prince of Lu.76 But the two loyalist groups failed to cooperate, making their chances of success even lower than they already were.77 In July 1646, a new Southern Campaign led by Prince Bolo sent Prince Lu's Zhejiang court into disarray and proceeded to attack the Longwu regime in Fujian.78 Zhu Yujian was caught and summarily executed in Tingzhou (western Fujian) on 6 October.79 His adoptive son Koxinga fled to the island of Taiwan with his fleet.80 Finally in November, the remaining centers of Ming resistance in Jiangxi province fell to the Qing.81

Johan Nieuhof's portrait of Shang Kexi, who recaptured Guangzhou from Ming loyalist forces in 1650. He was one of the Han Chinese generals the Qing relied on to conquer and administer southern China. Entrenched in the south, he eventually took part in the anti-Qing rebellion of the Three Feudatories in 1673.

In late 1646 two more Southern Ming monarchs emerged in the southern province of Guangzhou, reigning under the era names of Shaowu (&lt;U+7D39&gt;&lt;U+6B66&gt;) and Yongli.82 Short of official costumes, the Shaowu court had to purchase robes from local theater troops.83 The two Ming regimes fought each other until 20 January 1647, when a small Qing force led by Li Chengdong captured Guangzhou, killed the Shaowu Emperor, and sent the Yongli court fleeing to Nanning in Guangxi.84 In May 1648, however, Li mutinied against the Qing, and the concurrent rebellion of another former Ming general in Jiangxi helped Yongli to retake most of south China.85 This resurgence of loyalist hopes was short-lived. New Qing armies managed to reconquer the central provinces of Huguang (present-day Hubei and Hunan), Jiangxi, and Guangdong in 1649 and 1650.86 The Yongli emperor had to flee again.87 Finally on 24 November 1650, Qing forces led by Shang Kexi captured Guangzhou and massacred the city's population, killing as many as 70,000 people.88
Meanwhile in October 1646, Qing armies led by Hooge (the son of Hong Taiji who had lost the succession struggle of 1643) reached Sichuan, where their mission was to destroy the kingdom of bandit leader Zhang Xianzhong.89 Zhang was killed in a battle against Qing forces near Xichong in central Sichuan on 1 February 1647.90 Also late in 1646 but further north, forces assembled by a Muslim leader known in Chinese sources as Milayin (&lt;U+7C73&gt;&lt;U+5587&gt;&lt;U+5370&gt;) revolted against Qing rule in Ganzhou (Gansu). He was soon joined by another Muslim named Ding Guodong (&lt;U+4E01&gt;&lt;U+570B&gt;&lt;U+68DF&gt;).91 Proclaiming that they wanted to restore the Ming, they occupied a number of towns in Gansu, including the provincial capital Lanzhou.92 These rebels' willingness to collaborate with non-Muslim Chinese suggests that they were not only driven by religion.93 Both Milayin and Ding Guodong were captured and killed by Meng Qiaofang (&lt;U+5B5F&gt;&lt;U+55AC&gt;&lt;U+82B3&gt;; 1595&lt;U+2013&gt;1654) in 1648, and by 1650 the Muslim rebels had been crushed in campaigns that inflicted heavy casualties.94
Transition and personal rule (1651&lt;U+2013&gt;1661)
Purging Dorgon's clique
 Dorgon's unexpected death on 31 December 1650 during a hunting trip triggered a period of fierce factional struggles and opened the way for deep political reforms.95 Because Dorgon's supporters were still influential at court, Dorgon was given an imperial funeral and was posthumously elevated to imperial status as the &quot;Righteous Emperor&quot; (yi huangdi &lt;U+7FA9&gt;&lt;U+7687&gt;&lt;U+5E1D&gt;).96 On the same day of mid-January 1651, however, several officers of the White Banners led by former Dorgon supporter Ubai arrested Dorgon's brother Ajige for fear he would proclaim himself as the new regent; Ubai and his officers then named themselves presidents of several Ministries and prepared to take charge of the government.97
Meanwhile Jirgalang, who had been stripped of his title of regent in 1647, gathered support among Banner officers who had been disgruntled during Dorgon's rule.98 In order to consolidate support for the emperor in the two Yellow Banners (which had belonged to the Qing monarch since Hong Taiji) and to gain followers in Dorgon's Plain White Banner, Jirgalang named them the &quot;Upper Three Banners&quot; (shang san qi &lt;U+4E0A&gt;&lt;U+4E09&gt;&lt;U+65D7&gt;; Manchu: dergi ilan g&lt;U+016B&gt;sa), which from then on were owned and controlled by the emperor.99 Oboi and Suksaha, who would become regents for the Kangxi Emperor in 1661, were among the Banner officers who gave Jirgalang their support, and Jirgalang appointed them to the Council of Deliberative Princes to reward them.100
On 1 February, Jirgalang announced that Shunzhi, who was about to turn thirteen, would now assume full imperial authority.101 The regency was thus officially abolished. Jirgalang then moved to the attack. In late February or early March 1651 he accused Dorgon of usurping imperial prerogatives: Dorgon was found guilty and all his posthumous honors were removed.102 Jirgalang continued to purge former members of Dorgon's clique and to bestow high ranks and nobility titles upon a growing number of followers in the Three Imperial Banners, so that by 1652 all of Dorgon's former supporters had been either killed or effectively removed from government.103
Factional politics and the fight against corruption
 On 7 April 1651, barely two months after he seized the reins of government, Shunzhi issued an edict announcing that he would purge corruption from officialdom.104 This edict triggered factional conflicts among literati that would frustrate him until his death.105 One of his first gestures was to dismiss grand academician Feng Quan (&lt;U+99AE&gt;&lt;U+9293&gt;; 1595&lt;U+2013&gt;1672), a northern Chinese who had been impeached in 1645 but was allowed to remain in his post by Prince Regent Dorgon.106 Shunzhi replaced Feng with Chen Mingxia (&lt;U+9673&gt;&lt;U+540D&gt;&lt;U+590F&gt;; ca. 1601&lt;U+2013&gt;1654), an influential southern Chinese with good connections in Jiangnan literary societies.107 Though later in 1651 Chen was also dismissed on charges of influence peddling, he was reinstated in his post in 1653 and soon became a close personal advisor to the sovereign.108 He was even allowed to draft imperial edicts just like Ming Grand Secretaries used to.109 Still in 1653, Shunzhi decided to recall the disgraced Feng Quan, but instead of balancing the influence of northern and southern Chinese officials at court as the emperor had intended, Feng Quan's return only intensified factional strife.110 In several controversies at court in 1653 and 1654, the southerners formed one bloc opposed to the northerners and the Manchus.111 In April 1654, when Chen Mingxia spoke to northern official Ning Wanwo (&lt;U+5BE7&gt;&lt;U+5B8C&gt;&lt;U+6211&gt;; d. 1665) about restoring the style of dress of the Ming court, Ning immediately denounced Chen to the emperor and accused him of various crimes including bribe-taking, nepotism, factionalism, and usurping imperial prerogatives.112 Chen was executed by strangulation on 27 April 1654.113
In November 1657, a major cheating scandal erupted during the Shuntian provincial-level examinations in Beijing.114 Eight candidates from Jiangnan who were also relatives of Beijing officials had bribed examiners in the hope of being ranked higher in the contest.115 Seven examination supervisors found guilty of receiving bribes were executed, and several hundred people were sentenced to punishments ranging from demotion to exile and confiscation of property.116 The scandal, which soon spread to Nanjing examination circles, uncovered the corruption and influence-peddling that was rife in the bureaucracy, and that many moralistic officials from the north attributed to the existence of southern literary clubs and to the decline of classical scholarship.117
Chinese style of rule
During his short reign, the Shunzhi emperor encouraged Han Chinese to participate in government activities and revived many Chinese-style institutions that had been either abolished or marginalized during Dorgon's regency. He discussed history, classics, and politics with grand academicians like Chen Mingxia (see previous section) and surrounded himself with new men such as Wang Xi (&lt;U+738B&gt;&lt;U+7199&gt;; 1628&lt;U+2013&gt;1703), a young northern Chinese who was fluent in Manchu.118 The &quot;Six Edicts&quot; (Liu yu &lt;U+516D&gt;&lt;U+8AED&gt;) that Shunzhi promulgated in 1652 were the predecessors to Kangxi's &quot;Sacred Edicts&quot; (Shengyu &lt;U+8056&gt;&lt;U+8AED&gt;, 1670): &quot;bare bones of Confucian orthodoxy&quot; that instructed the population to behave in a filial and law-abiding fashion.119 In another move toward Chinese-style government, the sovereign reestablished the Hanlin Academy and the Grand Secretariat in 1658. These two institutions based on Ming models further eroded the power of the Manchu elite and threatened to revive the extremes of literati politics that had plagued the late Ming, when factions coalesced around rival grand secretaries.120
To counteract the power of the Imperial Household Department and the Manchu nobility, in July 1653 Shunzhi established the Thirteen Offices (&lt;U+5341&gt;&lt;U+4E09&gt;&lt;U+8859&gt;&lt;U+9580&gt;), or Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus, which were supervised by Manchus, but manned by Chinese eunuchs rather than Manchu bondservants.121 Eunuchs had been kept under tight control during Dorgon's regency, but the young emperor used them to counter the influence of other power centers like his mother the Empress Dowager and former regent Jirgalang.122 By the late 1650s eunuch power became formidable again: they handled key financial and political matters, offered advice on official appointments, and even composed edicts.123 Because eunuchs isolated the monarch from the bureaucracy, Manchu and Chinese officials feared a return to the abuses of eunuch power that had plagued the late Ming.124 Despite the emperor's attempt to impose strictures on eunuch activities, Shunzhi's favorite eunuch Wu Liangfu (&lt;U+5433&gt;&lt;U+826F&gt;&lt;U+8F14&gt;; d. 1661), who had helped him defeat the Dorgon faction in the early 1650s, was caught in a corruption scandal in 1658.125 The fact that Wu only received a reprimand for his accepting bribes did not reassure the Manchu elite, which saw eunuch power as a degradation of Manchu power.126 The Thirteen Offices would be eliminated (and Wu Liangfu executed) by Oboi and the other regents of the Kangxi Emperor in March 1661 soon after Shunzhi's death.127

In 1646, when Qing armies led by Bolo had entered the city of Fuzhou, they had found envoys from the Ry&lt;U+016B&gt;ky&lt;U+016B&gt; Kingdom, Annam, and the Spanish in Manila.129 These tributary embassies that had come to see the now fallen Longwu Emperor of the Southern Ming were forwarded to Beijing, and eventually sent home with instructions about submitting to the Qing.130 The King of the Ry&lt;U+016B&gt;ky&lt;U+016B&gt; Islands sent his first tribute mission to the Qing in 1649, Siam in 1652, and Annam in 1661, after the last remnants of Ming resistance had been removed from Yunnan, which bordered Annam.131
Also in 1646 sultan Abu al-Muhammad Haiji Khan, a Mughal prince who ruled Turfan, had sent an embassy requesting the resumption of trade with China, which had been interrupted by the fall of the Ming dynasty.132 The mission was sent without solicitation, but the Qing accepted to receive it, allowing it to conduct tribute trade in Beijing and Lanzhou (Gansu).133 But this agreement was interrupted by a Muslim rebellion that engulfed the northwest in 1646 (see the last paragraph of the &quot;Conquest of China&quot; section above). Tribute and trade with Hami and Turfan, which had aided the rebels, were eventually resumed in 1656.134 In 1655, however, the Qing court announced that tributary missions from Turfan would be accepted only once every five years.135

The bell-shaped White Dagoba, which can still be seen in Beihai Park in Beijing, was commissioned by the Shunzhi Emperor to honor Tibetan Buddhism.

In 1651 the young emperor invited to Beijing the Fifth Dalai Lama, the leader of the Yellow Hat Sect of Tibetan Buddhism, who, with the military help of Khoshot Mongol Gushri Khan, had recently unified religious and secular rule in Tibet.136 Qing emperors had been patrons of Tibetan Buddhism since at least 1621 under the reign of Nurhaci, but there were also political reasons behind the invitation.137 Namely, Tibet was becoming a powerful polity west of the Qing, and the Dalai Lama held influence over Mongol tribes, many of which had not submitted to the Qing.138 To prepare for the arrival of this &quot;living Buddha,&quot; Shunzhi ordered the building of the White Dagoba (baita &lt;U+767D&gt;&lt;U+5854&gt;) on an island on one of the imperial lakes northwest of the Forbidden City, at the former site of Qubilai Khan's palace.139 After more invitations and diplomatic exchanges to decide where the Tibetan leader would mean the Qing emperor, the Dalai Lama arrived in Beijing in January 1653.140 The Dalai Lama later had a scene of this visit carved in the Potala Palace in Lhasa, which he had started building in 1645.141
Meanwhile north of the Manchu homeland, adventurers Vassili Poyarkov (1643&lt;U+2013&gt;1646) and Yerofei Khabarov (1649&lt;U+2013&gt;1653) had started to explore the Amur River valley for Tzarist Russia. In 1653 Khabarov was recalled to Moscow and replaced by Onufriy Stepanov, who assumed command of Khabarov's Cossack troops.142 Stepanov went south into the Sungari River, along which he exacted &quot;yasak&quot; (fur tribute) from native populations like the Daur and the Duchers, but these groups resisted because they were already paying tribute to the Shunzhi Emperor (&quot;Shamshakan&quot; in Russian sources).143 In 1654 Stepanov defeated a small Manchu force that had been despatched from Ningguta to investigate Russian advances.144 In 1655 another Qing commander, the Mongol Minggadari (d. 1669), defeated Stepanov's forces at fort Kumarsk on the Amur, but this was not enough to chase the Russians.145 In 1658, however, Manchu general &lt;U+0160&gt;arh&lt;U+016B&gt;da (1599&lt;U+2013&gt;1659) attacked Stepanov with a fleet of 40 or more ships that managed to kill or capture most Russians.146 This Qing victory temporarily cleared the Amur valley of Cossack bands, but Russian-Manchu border conflicts would continue until 1689, when the signature of the Treaty of Nerchinsk fixed the borders between Russia and the Qing.147
Continuous campaigns against the Southern Ming
 Though the Qing under Dorgon's leadership had successfully pushed the Southern Ming deep into southern China, Ming loyalism was not dead yet. In early August 1652, Li Dingguo, who had served as general in Sichuan under bandit king Zhang Xianzhong (d. 1647) and was now protecting the Yongli Emperor of the Southern Ming, retook Guilin (Guangxi province) from the Qing.148 Within a month, most of the commanders who had been supporting the Qing in Guangxi reverted to the Ming side.149 Despite occasionally successful military campaigns in Huguang and Guangdong in the next two years, Li failed to retake important cities.150 In 1653, the Qing court put Hong Chengchou in charge of retaking the southwest.151 Headquartered in Changsha (in what is now Hunan province), he patiently built up his forces; only in late 1658 did well-fed and well-supplied Qing troops mount a multipronged campaign to take Guizhou and Yunnan.152 In late January 1659, a Qing army led by Manchu prince Doni took the capital of Yunnan, sending the Yongli Emperor fleeing into nearby Burma, which was then ruled by King Pindale Min of the Toungoo dynasty.153 The last sovereign of the Southern Ming stayed there until 1662, when he was captured and executed by Wu Sangui, the former Ming general whose surrender to the Manchus in April 1644 had allowed Dorgon to start the Qing conquest of China.154
Zheng Chenggong (&quot;Koxinga&quot;), who had been adopted by the Longwu Emperor in 1646 and ennobled by Yongli in 1655, also continued to defend the cause of the Southern Ming.155 In 1659, just as Shunzhi was preparing to hold a special examination to celebrate the glories of his reign and the success of the southwestern campaigns, Zheng sailed up the Yangtze River with a well-armed fleet, took several cities from Qing hands, and went so far as to threaten Nanjing.156 When the emperor heard of this sudden attack he is said to have slashed his throne with a sword in anger.157 But the siege of Nanjing was relieved and Zheng Chenggong repelled, forcing Zheng to take refuge in the southeastern coastal province of Fujian.158 Pressured by Qing fleets, Zheng fled to Taiwan in April 1661 but died that same summer.159 His descendants resisted Qing rule until 1683, when the Kangxi Emperor successfully took the island.160
Personality and relationships
 After Fulin came to rule on his own in 1651, his mother the Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang arranged for him to marry her niece, but the young monarch deposed his new Empress in 1653.161 The following year Xiaozhuang arranged another imperial marriage with her Khorchin Mongol clan, this time matching her son with her own grand-niece.162 Though Fulin also disliked his second empress (known posthumously as Empress Xiaohuizhang), he was not allowed to demote her. She never bore him children.163 Starting in 1656, Shunzhi lavished his affection on Consort Donggo, who, according to Jesuit accounts from the time, had first been the wife of another Manchu noble.164 She gave birth to a son (Shunzhi's fourth) in November 1657. The emperor would have made him his heir apparent, but he died early in 1658 before he was given a name.165
Shunzhi was an open-minded emperor and relied on the advice of Johann Adam Schall von Bell, a Jesuit missionary from Cologne in the Germanic parts of the Holy Roman Empire, for guidance on matters ranging from astronomy and technology to religion and government.166 In late 1644, Dorgon had put Schall in charge of preparing a new calendar because his eclipse predictions had proven more reliable than those of the official astronomer.167 After Dorgon's death Schall developed a personal relationship with the young emperor, who called him &quot;grand-father&quot; (mafa in Manchu).168 At the height of his influence in 1656 and 1657, Schall reports that Shunzhi often visited his house and talked to him late into the night.169 He was excused from prostrating himself in the presence of the emperor, was granted land to build a church in Beijing, and was even given imperial permission to adopt a son (because Fulin worried that Schall did not have an heir), but the Jesuits' hope of converting the Qing sovereign to Christianity was crushed when Shunzhi became a devout follower of Chan Buddhism in 1657.170
The emperor developed a good command of Chinese that allowed him to manage matters of state and to appreciate Chinese arts like calligraphy and drama.171 One of his favorite texts was &quot;Rhapsody of a Myriad Sorrows&quot; (Wan chou qu &lt;U+842C&gt;&lt;U+6101&gt;&lt;U+66F2&gt;), by Gui Zhuang (&lt;U+6B78&gt;&lt;U+838A&gt;; 1613&lt;U+2013&gt;1673), who was a close friend of anti-Qing intellectuals Gu Yanwu and Wan Shouqi (&lt;U+842C&gt;&lt;U+58FD&gt;&lt;U+797A&gt;; 1603&lt;U+2013&gt;1652).172 &quot;Quite passionate and attach[ing] great importance to qing (love),&quot; he could also recite by heart long passages of the popular Romance of the Western Chamber.173
Death and succession

Electron micrograph of the smallpox virus, against which the Manchus had no immunity. The Shunzhi emperor died of it, and his young successor Kangxi was chosen because he had already survived it.

Smallpox
In September 1660, Shunzhi's favourite consort suddenly died as a result of grief over the loss of a child.174 Overwhelmed with grief, the emperor fell into dejection for months, until he contracted smallpox on 2 February 1661.175 On 4 February 1661, officials Wang Xi (&lt;U+738B&gt;&lt;U+7199&gt;, 1628&lt;U+2013&gt;1703; the emperor's confidant) and Margi (a Manchu) were called to the emperor's bedside to record his last will.176 On the same day, his seven-year-old third son Xuanye was chosen to be his successor, probably because he had already survived smallpox.177 The emperor died on 5 February 1661 in the Forbidden City at the age of twenty-two.178
The Manchus feared smallpox more than any other disease because they had no immunity to it and almost always died when they contracted it.179 By 1622 at the latest, they had already established an agency to investigate smallpox cases and isolate sufferers to avoid contagion.180 During outbreaks, royal family members were routinely sent to &quot;smallpox avoidance centers&quot; (bidousuo &lt;U+907F&gt;&lt;U+75D8&gt;&lt;U+6240&gt;) to protect themselves from infection.181 The Shunzhi emperor was particularly fearful of the disease, because he was young and lived in a large city, near sources of contagion.182 Indeed, during his reign at least nine outbreaks of smallpox were recorded in Beijing, each time forcing the emperor to move to a protected area like the &quot;Southern Park&quot; (Nanyuan &lt;U+5357&gt;&lt;U+82D1&gt;), a hunting ground south of Beijing where Dorgon had built a &quot;smallpox avoidance center&quot; in the 1640s.183 Despite this and other precautions&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+2013&gt;such as rules forcing Chinese residents to move out of the city when they contracted smallpox&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+2013&gt;the young monarch still succumbed to that illness.184
The emperor's forged last will
 The emperor's last will, which was made public on the evening of 5 February, appointed four regents for his young son: Oboi, Soni, Suksaha, and Ebilun, who had all helped Jirgalang to purge the court of Dorgon's supporters after Dorgon's death on the last day of 1650.185 It is difficult to determine whether Shunzhi had really named these four Manchu nobles as regents, because they and Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang clearly tempered with the emperor's testament before promulgating it.186 The emperor's will expressed his regret about his Chinese-style ruling (his reliance on eunuchs and his favoritism toward Chinese officials), his neglect of Manchu nobles and traditions, and his headstrong devotion to his consort rather than to his mother.187 Though the emperor had often issued self-deprecating edicts during his reign, the policies his will rejected had been central to his government since he had assumed personal rule in the early 1650s.188 The will as it was formulated gave &quot;the mantle of imperial authority&quot; to the four regents, and served to support their pro-Manchu policies during the period known as the Oboi regency, which lasted from 1661 to 1669.189
After death
Because court statements did not clearly announce the cause of the emperor's death, rumors soon started to circulate that he had not died but in fact retired to a Buddhist monastery to live anonymously as a monk, either out of grief for the death of his beloved consort, or because of a coup by the Manchu nobles his will had named as regents.190 These rumors were not so incredible, because the emperor had become a fervent follower of Chan Buddhism in the late 1650s, even letting monks move into the imperial palace.191 But much circumstantial evidence&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+2013&gt;including an account by one of these monks that the emperor's health greatly deteriorated in early February 1661 because of smallpox, and the fact that a concubine and an Imperial Bodyguard committed suicide to accompany the emperor in burial&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+2013&gt;suggests that Shunzhi's death was not staged.192
After being kept in the Forbidden City for 27 days of mourning, on 3 March 1661 the emperor's corpse was transported in a lavish procession to Jingshan &lt;U+666F&gt;&lt;U+5C71&gt; (a hillock just north of the Forbidden City), after which a large amount of precious goods were burned as funeral offerings.193 Only two years later, in 1653, was the body transported to its final resting place.194 Contrary to Manchu customs at the time, which usually dictated that a deceased person should be cremated, the Shunzhi Emperor was buried.195 He was interred in what later came to be known as the Eastern Qing Tombs, 125 kilometers (75 miles) northeast of Beijing, one of two Qing imperial cemeteries.196 His tomb is part of the Xiaoling (&lt;U+5B5D&gt;&lt;U+9675&gt;) mausoleum complex (known in Manchu as the Hiyoo&lt;U+0161&gt;ungga Munggan), which was the first mausoleum to be erected on that site.197
Legacy


The Kangxi Emperor's three &quot;southern tours&quot; in the Jiangnan region&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+2013&gt;1684, 1689 (here depicted), and 1699&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+2013&gt;asserted the prestige and confidence of the newly solidifed Qing dynasty a few years after it defeated the Three Feudatories.198

The fake will in which the Shunzhi emperor had supposedly expressed regret for abandoning Manchu traditions gave authority to the nativist policies of the Kangxi Emperor's four regents.199 Citing the testament, Oboi and the other regents quickly abolished the Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus.200 Over the next few years, they enhanced the power of the Imperial Household Department, which was run by Manchus and their bondservants, eliminated the Hanlin Academy, and limited membership in the Deliberative Council of Princes and Ministers to Manchus and Mongols.201 The regents also adopted aggressive policies toward the Qing's Chinese subjects: they executed dozens of people and punished thousands of others in the wealthy Jiangnan region for literary dissent and tax arrears, and forced the coastal population of southeast China to move inland in order to starve the Taiwan-based Kingdom of Tungning run by descendants of Koxinga.202
After the Kangxi Emperor managed to imprison Oboi in 1669, he reverted many of the regents' policies.203 He restored institutions his father had favored, including a Grand Secretariat in which Chinese officials gained an important voice in government.204 His also defeated the rebellion of the Three Feudatories, three Chinese military commanders who had played key military roles in the Qing conquest, but had now become entrenched rulers of enormous domains in southern China.205 The civil war (1673&lt;U+2013&gt;1681) tested the loyalty of the new Qing subjects, but Qing armies eventually prevailed.206 Once Qing victory had become certain, a special examination for &quot;eminent scholars of broad learning&quot; (&lt;U+535A&gt;&lt;U+5B78&gt;&lt;U+9D3B&gt;&lt;U+5112&gt; Boxue hongru) was held in 1679 to attract Chinese literati who had refused to serve the new dynasty.207 The successful candidates were assigned to compile the official history of the fallen Ming dynasty.208 The rebellion was defeated in 1681, the same year Kangxi initiated the use of variolation to inoculate children of the imperial family against smallpox.209 When the Kingdom of Tungning finally fell in 1683, the military consolidation of the Qing regime was complete.210 The institutional foundation laid by Dorgon, Shunzhi, and Kangxi allowed the Qing to erect an imperial edifice of awesome proportion and to turn it into &quot;one of the most successful imperial states the world has known.&quot;211 Ironically, however, the prolonged Pax Manchurica that followed the Kangxi consolidation made the Qing fatefully unprepared to face aggressive and well-armed European powers in the nineteenth century.212
Family

Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang, who was an influential political figure during the reigns of both her son Shunzhi and her grand-son Kangxi.

Ascendants
The Shunzhi Emperor was born in the Manchu Aisin Gioro clan, the Qing imperial family.213

Father: Hong Taiji (1592&lt;U+2013&gt;1643), emperor of the Qing dynasty, of whom Fulin was the ninth son.214
Mother: Bumbutai (1613&lt;U+2013&gt;1688), daughter of Jaisang (&lt;U+5BE8&gt;&lt;U+6851&gt;), a Khorchin Mongol prince of the Borjigit clan; titled &quot;Consort Zhuang&quot; from 1636 to 1643, she became empress dowager after her son was enthroned in 1643, and is known posthumously as Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang.215


Empress Xiaohuizhang, a Khorchin Mongol just like Shunzhi's mother, became the emperor's second Empress Consort in 1654.


Paternal grandfather: Nurhaci (1559&lt;U+2013&gt;1626), the retrospectively identified founder of the Qing dynasty.216
Paternal grandmother: Monggo (1573&lt;U+2013&gt;1603), of the Manchu Yehenara clan; consort of Nurhaci; posthumously known as Empress Xiaocigao.217

Empresses and consorts
Although only nineteen empresses and consorts are recorded for Shunzhi in the Aisin Gioro genealogy made by the Imperial Clan Court, burial records show that he had at least thirty-two of them.218 Eleven bore him children. There were two empresses in his reign, both relatives of his mother the empress dowager. After the 1644 conquest, imperial consorts and empresses were usually known by their titles and by the name of their patrilineal clan.219

First Empress: the Demoted Empress, from the Borjigit clan of the Khorchin Mongols; niece of Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang.220 She was made Empress in 1651, but the monarch disliked her so much that he had her demoted in 1653.221
Second Empress: Empress Xiaohuizhang (d. 1718), also from the Borjigit clan. She was named Empress in 1654.222 After the emperor's death in 1661 she was named Empress Dowager Ciren (&lt;U+6148&gt;&lt;U+4EC1&gt;).223 Xiaohuizhang is her posthumous name.
Concubine (1640&lt;U+2013&gt;1663) from the Tong (&lt;U+4F5F&gt;) clan, a &quot;Nikan&quot;&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+2013&gt;Manchu name for &quot;Chinese&quot;&lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+2013&gt;family that had lived in Fushun (Manchuria) for generations, and was now registered in the Chinese Eight Banners.224 She was made Empress Dowager Cihe (&lt;U+6148&gt;&lt;U+548C&gt;) when her son Xuanye became the Kangxi emperor in 1661, and is known posthumously as Empress Xiaokangzhang.225 Because the Tongs were so close to the imperial family, in 1688 the Tong clan was renamed Tunggiya and was from then on considered to be Manchu.226
Imperial Noble Consort from the Donggo clan (1639&lt;U+2013&gt;1660), posthumously raised to Empress Xiaoxian. The Emperor was deeply in love with her and was very grieved when she died soon after their first son (Shunzhi's fourth) had died in infancy.227 He died of smallpox shortly thereafter.

Children
Eleven of Shunzhi's thirty-two spouses bore him a total of fourteen children,228 but only four sons (Fuquan, Xuanye, Changning, and Longxi) and one daughter (Princess Gongyi Chang) lived to be old enough to marry. Unlike later Qing emperors, the names of Shunzhi's sons did not include a generational character.229

Daughters
Before the Qing court moved to Beijing in 1644, Manchu women used to have personal names, but after 1644 these names &quot;disappear from the genealogical and archival records.&quot;251 Only after their betrothal were imperial daughters given a title and rank, by which they then became known.252 Although five of the Shunzhi Emperor's six daughters died in infancy or childhood, they all appear in the Aisin Gioro genealogy.253
