nihongo Amagi  was a sclass Unry aircraft carrier of the Imperial Japanese Navy built during World War II. Named after Mount Amagi,Silverstone, p. 325 and completed late in the war, she never embarked her complement of aircraft and spent the war in Japanese waters. The ship Capsizing capsized in July 1945 after being hit multiple times during airstrikes by American carrier aircraft at Kure Naval Base. Amagi was refloated in 1946 and ship breaking scrapped later that year.

Design and description
The last purpose-built Japanese carrier construction during World War II was a group of vessels based on an improved ship Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry  2 design, but with individual units differing in detail reflecting the changing circumstances as the conflict in the Pacific approached its conclusion. Amagi was ordered, under the provisional name of #5001, as part of the Modified 5th Naval Armaments Supplement Programme Japan, 1942 Kai-Maru 5 Program of 1942. This was a massive naval construction program intended to replace losses suffered at the Battle of Midway and focused on aircraft and aircraft carriers. The ship was one of 16 sclass Unry aircraft carriers planned, although only three were completed before the end of the war.#tag:ref Two of these ships were canceled to release a slipway and material to convert ship Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano  2 into an aircraft carrier.Lengerer, p. 106 group=Note

Amagi had a length of convert 227.35 m ftin sp=us length overall overall. She had a beam nautical beam of convert 22 m ftin sp=us and, a draft ship draft of convert 8.73 m ftin sp=us. She displacement ship displaced convert 20450 t LT. Her crew consisted of 1,595 officers and men.Jentschura, Jung and Mickel, p. 56

The Unry-class carriers used the same turbines and boilers as used in the ship Japanese cruiser Suzuya 1934 6. These consisted of four geared steam turbine sets with a total of convert 152000 shp kW lk=in driving four shafts. Steam was provided by eight Kampon Type B water-tube boilers with a working pressure of convert 22 kgf/cm2 kPa psi 0 abbr=on lk=on at convert 300 C. The ship had a designed speed of convert 34 kn lk=in. Amagi carried convert 3670 t LT of fuel oil which gave her a range of convert 8000 nmi lk=in at convert 18 kn. She had two funnel ship funnels on the starboard side, each angled below horizontal. They were fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by hot exhaust gases.Lengerer, pp. 115, 117

Flight deck arrangements
Amagi's flight deck was convert 216.9 m ftin sp=us long and had a maximum width of convert 27 m ftin sp=us. A small Glossary of nautical terms#I island  was mounted well forward on the starboard side and contained the ship's bridge nautical bridge and air operations control center. It was fitted with a small tripod mast that mounted one of the ship's radar antenna radio antennas. The ship was designed with two superimposed hangars that were served by two Elevator#Aircraft_elevators aircraft elevators, each convert 14 by 14 m ft sp=us; the center elevator as used in Hiry was deleted to simplify construction and reduce stress in the hull. The elevators had a maximum capacity of convert 7000 kg sp=us and took 19 seconds to go from the lower hangar to the flight deck. Amagi was fitted with hydraulically operated Type 3 arresting gear with nine cables. She also mounted three Type 3 Arresting_gear#Barricade crash barricades. No aircraft catapult was fitted. The ship mounted a retractable crane machine crane on the starboard side of the flight deck, just aft of the rear elevator.Lengerer, pp. 11012, 118

The ship's air group was originally intended to consist of 12 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, plus three in storage, 27 Aichi D3A Val dive bombers, plus three in reserve, and 18 Nakajima B5N Kate torpedo bombers plus two in crates. Amagi's hangars could not accommodate so many aircraft so eleven planes were planned to be permanently carried on the flight deck. In 1943 the air group was revised to consist of 18 Mitsubishi A7M Sam fighters +2 in storage, 27 Yokosuka D4Y Judy dive bombers and six Nakajima C6N Myrt reconnaissance aircraft. Of these, the C6Ns were intended to be carried on the flight deck. When the ship commissioned in 1944, neither the A7M nor the C6Ns were yet in service, so the air group was reconfigured to consist of 27 Zeros, 12 D4Ys, three of which were to be the reconnaissance version,  and nine Nakajima B6N Jill torpedo bombers. By this time, however, the shortage of carrier-qualified aircrew was such that they were ordered to operate from shore bases and Amagi never embarked her air group.Lengerer, pp. 11718

Armor, armament and sensors
Amagi's waterline Belt armor armored belt was convert 1.8 in disp=flip sp=us thick over her machinery spaces and convert 5.5 in disp=flip sp=us over her magazine artillery magazines. Her Deck ship deck armor above the magazines was convert 25 mm in sp=us thick, but the deck above the magazines was convert 2.2 in disp=flip sp=us thick.Chesneau, p. 184

The ship's primary armament consisted of a dozen 40-caliber artillery caliber 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval gun 12.7&nbsp;cm Type 89 anti-aircraft warfare anti-aircraft AA guns in twin mounts on sponsons on the ship's sides.Lengerer, p. 118 Amagi was initially equipped with 16 triple Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun 25&nbsp;mm Type 96 and three single AA gun mounts, most on sponsons along the sides of the hull. By the end of the war, the ship mounted 22 triple and 23 single mounts.Stille, p. 37 These guns were supplemented by six 28-round AA rocket launchers. For defense against submarines, the carrier was fitted with six depth charge throwers and carried between six and ten depth charges for them.Lengerer, p. 119

Two Type 94 high-angle Fire-control system#Naval fire control fire-control directors, one on each side of the ship, were fitted to control the Type 89 guns. Each director mounted a convert 4.5 m ftin adj=on sp=us rangefinder. Six Type 95 directors controlled the 25&nbsp;mm guns and the 12&nbsp;cm rocket launchers. Early warning was provided by two List_of_Japanese_World_War_II_radar#Shipborne_Radar Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 air search radars. One of these was mounted on the top of the island while the other retracted into the port side of the flight deck, between the two elevators. In addition, Amagi had two smaller List_of_Japanese_World_War_II_radar#Land-based_Radar Type 3, Mark 1, Model 3 air search radars, one mounted on the tripod mast on the island and the other on the aft starboard retractable radio mast.Lengerer, pp. 11920

Service

Amagi's keel was laid down by Mitsubishi in Nagasaki, Nagasaki Nagasaki, on 1 October 1942. She was Ship naming and launching launched on 15 October 1943 and completed on 10 August 1944.Lengerer, p. 106 The ship was transferred among a number of ports on the Seto Inland Sea Inland Sea until she arrived in Kure in February 1945 and was ordered to be camouflaged. Her intended air group, Air Group 601, was committed to the Battle of Iwo Jima about that same time. Amagi was briefly refitted from 10 to 24 February. On 19 March, the ship Attack on Kure March 1945 was attacked by aircraft from Task Force 58 and lightly damaged by one bomb that struck the edge of the flight deck. On 13 April, the ship was permanently moored at an island in Kure harbor and extensively camouflaged.

This did not prevent the aircraft from Task Force 38 from Bombing of Kure July 1945 locating and attacking the ship on 24 July. She was hit twice and near-missed multiple times. A convert 500 lb adj=on bomb detonated near the rear funnel, severely damaging it, but doing little other damage aside from blowing a small hole in the starboard hull. A convert 2000 lb adj=on bomb penetrated the flight deck and detonated in the upper hangar, between the elevators. The explosion blew a convert 50 m adj=on sp=us section of a hangar wall overboard and the walls of the upper hangar deck were bulged and perforated multiple times. The flight deck between the elevators was bulged up and buckled for a length of convert 200 ft 1 and the forward elevator was dropped to the bottom of its shaft. It also blew a convert 25 ft adj=on hole in the upper hangar deck. Fragments from the explosion penetrated into the bowels of the ship, penetrating bulkhead partition bulkheads and decks below. Fragments from near-misses penetrated the sides of the port hull and caused the forward bomb magazine, two boiler rooms, and the aft port engine room to flood.Tully

The captain nautical captain ordered the ship abandoned later in the day, and the carrier was still afloat in the evening, albeit with a slight list watercraft list to port and down by the bow. Over the next couple of days, more compartments in the ship flooded and she settled on the bottom of the harbor. Another attack on 28 July hit her several more times and the resulting damage from those hits and more near-misses to port caused the ship to list further to port. This gradually increased through the next day until Amagi capsized at 10:00 on the morning of 29 July with part of her flight deck falling overboard. The losses among the ship's crew are unknown, but were supposedly light. 

The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 30 November and marine salvage salvage work began on 5 December. The holes in the ship's hull had to be sealed to pump the water out and decrease her draft. The remains of her flight deck and upper hangar could not be made watertight and were removed using dynamite. Float nautical Pontoons were used to right the ship and she was refloated on 31 July 1946. The salvage job was conducted by the Hitachi Zosen Corporation Hitachi Zosen facility in Kure and they scrapped the ship afterward.Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, pp. 11012 The job was completed by 12 December 1947.
