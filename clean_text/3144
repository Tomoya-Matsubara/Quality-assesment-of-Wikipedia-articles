The mummichog, is a small killifish found in the eastern United States.
The mummichog spawns on new and full moons in the spring and summer. Its eggs are laid near the high tide mark and can tolerate long-term exposure to air. The eggs are used in teaching embryology, because it is possible to see the eyes and the beating heart and follow the different stages of ontogenesis. These fish are used to stock otherwise fishless ponds that breed mosquitos, and within three days the ponds are normally mosquito free.
Because of the extreme hardiness of the species, it is sometimes the only species found in severely polluted and oxygen-deprived streams, such as the Elizabeth River in Virginia, and the Hackensack River and the Arthur Kill in New Jersey during the height of the water pollution problem in the United States. In 1973 the mummichog became the first fish in space when carried on Skylab 3 as part of the biological experiments package later space missions by the U.S., such as Bion 3, have also carried mummichog.
