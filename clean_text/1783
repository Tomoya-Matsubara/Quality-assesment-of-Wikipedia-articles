Jack the Ripper is a pseudonym given to an unidentified serial killer active in the largely impoverished districts in and around Whitechapel, London, in late 1888. The name originated in a letter by someone claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media. The letter is widely considered to be a hoax, and may have been written by a journalist in a deliberate attempt to heighten interest in the story.
Attacks ascribed to the Ripper typically involve women prostitutes whose throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations. The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer possessed anatomical or surgical knowledge. Rumours that the murders were connected intensified in September and October 1888, and media outlets and Scotland Yard received a series of extremely disturbing letters from a writer or writers purporting to be the murderer. One letter, received by George Lusk, of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, included half of a preserved human kidney, supposedly from one of the victims. Mainly because of the extraordinarily brutal character of the murders, and because of media treatment of the events, the public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer, Jack the Ripper. Extensive newspaper coverage bestowed widespread and enduring international notoriety on the Ripper. The murders most often attributed to the Ripper occurred in the latter half of 1888, although a longer series of brutal killings in Whitechapel persisted at least until 1891. The investigation was unable to connect the later killings conclusively to the murders of 1888, but the legend of Jack the Ripper solidified.
The term &quot;ripperology&quot; was coined to describe the study and analysis of the Ripper cases. As the murders were never solved, the legends surrounding them became a combination of genuine historical research, folklore, and pseudohistory. There are over one hundred theories about the Ripper's identity, and the murders have inspired multiple works of fiction.
Background
In the mid 19th century, England experienced an influx of Irish immigrants, who swelled the populations of England's major cities, including the East End of London. From 1882, Jewish refugees from eastern Europe and Tsarist Russia moved into the same area.1 London's East End, and the civil parish of Whitechapel became increasingly overcrowded, work and housing conditions worsened, and a massive economic underclass developed.2 Robbery, violence and alcohol dependency were commonplace, and the endemic poverty drove many women to prostitution. In October 1888, the London Metropolitan Police estimated that there were 1200 prostitutes and about 62 brothels in Whitechapel.3 The economic problems were accompanied by a steady rise in social tensions. Between 1886 and 1889, frequent demonstrations, such as that of 13 November 1887, led to police intervention and further public unrest.4 Racism, crime, social disturbance, and real deprivation fed public perceptions that Whitechapel was a notorious den of immorality.5 In 1888, such perceptions were strengthened when a series of vicious and grotesque murders attributed to &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; received unprecedented coverage in the media.6
Murders
  The large number of horrific attacks against women in the East End during this era adds uncertainty to how many victims were killed by the same person.7 Eleven separate murders, stretching from 3 April 1888 to 13 February 1891, were included in a London Metropolitan Police Service investigation, and were known collectively in the police docket as the &quot;Whitechapel murders&quot;.89 Opinions vary as to whether these murders should be linked to the same culprit or not, but five of the eleven Whitechapel murders, known as the &quot;canonical five&quot;, are widely believed to be the work of the Ripper.10 Most experts point to deep throat slashes, abdominal and genital-area mutilation, removal of internal organs, and progressive facial mutilations as the distinctive features of Jack the Ripper's modus operandi.11
The first two cases in the Whitechapel murders file, those of Emma Elizabeth Smith and Martha Tabram, are non-canonical. Smith was robbed and sexually assaulted on Osborn Street, Whitechapel, on 3 April 1888. A blunt object was inserted into her vagina, which ruptured her peritoneum. She developed peritonitis, and died the following day at London Hospital.12 She said that she had been attacked by two or three men, one of whom was a teenager.13 Although this attack was linked to the later murders by the press,14 it was almost certainly gang violence unrelated to the Ripper.151617
Tabram was killed on 7 August 1888; she had suffered 39 stab wounds. The savagery of the murder, the lack of obvious motive, and the closeness of the location (George Yard, Whitechapel) and date to those of the later Ripper murders led police to link them.18 However, the attack differs from the canonical ones in that Tabram was stabbed rather than slashed at the throat and abdomen. Many experts today do not connect it with the later murders because of the difference in the wound pattern.19
Canonical five
The canonical five Ripper victims are Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes and Mary Jane Kelly. Nichols' body was discovered at about 3:40 a.m. on Friday 31 August 1888 in Buck's Row (now Durward Street), Whitechapel. The throat was severed deeply by two cuts, and the lower part of the abdomen was partly ripped open by a deep, jagged wound. Several other incisions on the abdomen were caused by the same knife.20
Chapman's body was discovered at about 6 a.m. on Saturday 8 September 1888 near a doorway in the back yard of 29 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields. As in the case of Mary Ann Nichols, the throat was severed by two cuts.21 The abdomen was slashed entirely open, and it was later discovered that the uterus had been removed.22 At the inquest, one witness described seeing Chapman with a dark-haired man of &quot;shabby-genteel&quot; appearance at about 5:30 a.m.23
Stride and Eddowes were killed on Sunday 30 September 1888. Stride's body was discovered at about 1 a.m., in Dutfield's Yard, off Berner Street (now Henriques Street) in Whitechapel. The cause of death was one clear-cut incision which severed the main artery on the left side of the neck. Uncertainty about whether Stride's murder should be attributed to the Ripper, or whether he was interrupted during the attack, stems from the absence of mutilations to the abdomen.24 Witnesses who thought they saw Stride with a man earlier that night gave differing descriptions: some said her companion was fair, others dark; some said he was shabbily-dressed, others well-dressed.25 Eddowes' body was found in Mitre Square, in the City of London, three-quarters of an hour after Stride's. The throat was severed, and the abdomen was ripped open by a long, deep, jagged wound. The left kidney and the major part of the uterus had been removed. A local man, Joseph Lawende, had passed through the square shortly before the murder with two friends, and he described seeing a fair-haired man of shabby appearance with a woman who may have been Eddowes.26 His companions, however, were unable to confirm his description.27 Eddowes' and Stride's murders were later called the &quot;double event&quot;.28 Part of Eddowes' bloodied apron was found at the entrance to a tenement in Goulston Street, Whitechapel. Some writing on the wall above the apron piece, which became known as the Goulston Street graffito, seemed to implicate a Jew or Jews, but it was unclear whether the graffito was written by the murderer as he dropped the apron piece, or merely incidental.29 Police Commissioner Charles Warren feared the graffito might spark antisemitic riots, and ordered it washed away before dawn.30  Kelly's gruesomely mutilated body was discovered lying on the bed in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, off Dorset Street, Spitalfields, shortly after 10:45 a.m. on Friday 9 November 1888. The throat had been severed down to the spine, and the abdomen virtually emptied of its organs. The heart was missing.
The canonical five murders were perpetrated at night, on or close to a weekend, and either at the end of a month or a week or so after.31 The mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded, except for that of Stride, whose attacker may have been interrupted.32 Nichols was not missing any organs; Chapman's uterus was taken; Eddowes had her uterus and a kidney removed and her face mutilated; Kelly's body was eviscerated and her face hacked away, though only her heart was missing from the crime scene.
Historically, the belief that these five crimes were committed by the same man derives from contemporary documents that link them together to the exclusion of others.33 In 1894, Sir Melville Macnaghten, Assistant Chief Constable of the Metropolitan Police Service and Head of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), wrote a report that stated: &quot;the Whitechapel murderer had 5 victims&lt;U+2014&gt;&amp; 5 victims only&quot;.34 Similarly, the canonical five victims were linked together in a letter written by the police surgeon Thomas Bond to Robert Anderson, head of the London CID, on 10 November 1888.35 While the police evidently treated the five murders as a single case, authors Stewart P. Evans and Donald Rumbelow argue that the canonical five is a &quot;Ripper myth&quot; and that while three cases (Nichols, Chapman, and Eddowes) can be definitely linked, there is less certainty over Stride and Kelly, and less again over Tabram.36 Dr Percy Clark, assistant to the examining pathologist George Bagster Phillips, linked only three of the murders and thought the others were perpetrated by &quot;weak-minded individual[s]Â ... induced to emulate the crime&quot;.37 Macnaghten did not join the police force until the year after the murders, and his memorandum contains serious factual errors about possible suspects.38 Some researchers have posited that the series may not have been the work of a single murderer at all, but of an unknown larger number of killers acting independently.39 Conversely, others suppose that the six murders between Tabram and Kelly were the work of a single killer.40
Later Whitechapel murders
Kelly is generally considered to be the Ripper's final victim, and it is assumed that the crimes ended because of the culprit's death, imprisonment, institutionalisation, or emigration.41 The Whitechapel murders file does, however, detail another four murders that happened after the canonical five, those of Rose Mylett, Alice McKenzie, The Pinchin Street torso, and Frances Coles.
Mylett was found strangled in Clarke's Yard, High Street, Poplar on 20 December 1888. As there was no sign of a struggle, the police believed that she had accidentally choked herself while in a drunken stupor, or committed suicide.42 Nevertheless, the inquest jury returned a verdict of murder.43
McKenzie was killed on 17 July 1889 by severance of the left carotid artery. Several minor bruises and cuts were found on the body, discovered in Castle Alley, Whitechapel. One of the examining pathologists, Thomas Bond, believed this to be a Ripper murder, though another pathologist, George Bagster Phillips, who had examined the bodies of three previous victims, disagreed.44 Later writers are also divided between those who think that her murderer copied the Ripper's modus operandi to deflect suspicion from himself,45 and those that ascribe it to the Ripper.46
&quot;The Pinchin Street torso&quot; was a headless and legless torso of an unidentified woman found under a railway arch in Pinchin Street, Whitechapel, on 10 September 1889. It seems probable that the murder was committed elsewhere and that parts of the dismembered body were dumped at the crime scene.47
Coles was killed on 13 February 1891 under a railway arch at Swallow Gardens, Whitechapel. Her throat was cut but the body was not mutilated. A man named James Thomas Sadler, seen earlier with her, was arrested by the police, charged with her murder and was briefly thought to be the Ripper.48 He was, however, later discharged from court due to lack of evidence on 3 March 1891.49
Other alleged victims
In addition to the eleven Whitechapel murders, other contemporary attacks have been connected to the Ripper by commentators. In some cases, it is unclear whether these stories were true or whether they were fabricated as a part of Ripper lore.50 &quot;Fairy Fay&quot; was a nickname for an unknown murder victim allegedly found on 26 December 1887 &quot;after a stake had been thrust through her abdomen&quot;.51 It has been suggested that &quot;Fairy Fay&quot; was a creation of the press based upon confusion of the details of the murder of Emma Elizabeth Smith with a separate non-fatal attack the previous Christmas.52 The name of &quot;Fairy Fay&quot; was first used for this alleged victim in 1950.53 There were no recorded murders in Whitechapel at or around Christmas 1887.54 Most authors agree that &quot;Fairy Fay&quot; never existed.5556
Annie Millwood (born c. 1850) was reportedly admitted to hospital with &quot;numerous stabs in the legs and lower part of the body&quot;57 on 25 February 1888. She was discharged but died from apparently natural causes on 31 March 1888.58 Ada Wilson reportedly survived being stabbed twice in the neck on 28 March 1888.5960 Annie Farmer (born c. 1848) reported an attack on 21 November 1888. She had a superficial cut on her throat, possibly self-inflicted. A Jewish cigar-maker, Joseph Isaacs, was arrested on suspicion of the attack and of being the Ripper, but was not connected to the crimes.61  &quot;The Whitehall Mystery&quot; was a term coined for the discovery of a headless torso of a woman on 2 October 1888 in the basement of the new Metropolitan Police headquarters being built in Whitehall. An arm belonging to the body was previously discovered floating in the river Thames near Pimlico, and one of the legs was subsequently discovered buried near where the torso was found.62 The other limbs and head were never recovered and the body was never identified. The mutilations were similar to those in the Pinchin Street case, although in that case the hands were not severed. It has been suggested that The Whitehall Mystery and the Pinchin Street case may have been part of a series of murders, called the &quot;Thames Mysteries&quot; or &quot;Embankment Murders&quot;, committed by a single serial killer, dubbed the &quot;Torso killer&quot;.63 Whether Jack the Ripper and the &quot;Torso killer&quot; were the same person or separate serial killers active in the same area is debatable.64 As the modus operandi of the torso killer differed from that of the Ripper, police at the time discounted any connection between the two.65 Elizabeth Jackson, a prostitute whose various body parts were collected from the river Thames between 31 May and 25 June 1889, may have been another victim of the &quot;Torso killer&quot;.66
John Gill, a seven-year-old boy was found murdered in Manningham, Bradford, on 29 December 1888. His legs had been severed, his abdomen opened, his intestines drawn out, and his heart and one ear removed. The similarities with the murder of Mary Kelly led to press speculation that the Ripper had killed the boy.67 The boy's employer, milkman William Barrett, was twice arrested for the murder on circumstantial evidence but was released.68 No-one else was ever prosecuted.69
Carrie Brown (nicknamed &quot;Shakespeare&quot;, reportedly for quoting Shakespeare's sonnets) was strangled with clothing and then mutilated with a knife on 24 April 1891 in Manhattan.70 Her body was found with a large tear through her groin area and superficial cuts on her legs and back. No organs were removed from the scene, though an ovary, either purposely removed or unintentionally dislodged, was found upon the bed.71 At the time, the murder was compared to those in Whitechapel though the Metropolitan Police eventually ruled out any connection.72
Investigation
 The surviving police files on the Whitechapel murders allow a detailed view of investigative procedure in the Victorian era.73 A large team of policemen conducted house-to-house inquiries throughout Whitechapel, forensic material was collected and examined and suspects were identified, traced and either examined more closely or eliminated from the inquiry. Over 2000 people were interviewed, &quot;upwards of 300&quot; people were investigated, and 80 people were detained.74 Police work follows the same pattern today.75
The investigation was initially conducted by the Metropolitan Police Whitechapel (H) Division Criminal Investigation Department (CID) headed by Detective Inspector Edmund Reid. After the Nichols murder, Detective Inspectors Frederick Abberline, Henry Moore, and Walter Andrews were sent from Central Office at Scotland Yard to assist. After the Eddowes murder, which occurred within the City of London, the City Police under Detective Inspector James McWilliam were involved.76 However, overall direction of the murder enquiries was hampered by the fact that the newly appointed head of the CID, Robert Anderson, was on leave in Switzerland between 7 September and 6 October, during the time Chapman, Stride and Eddowes were killed.77 This prompted the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Charles Warren, to appoint Chief Inspector Donald Swanson to coordinate the enquiry from Scotland Yard.78
 Due in part to dissatisfaction with the police effort, a group of volunteer citizens in London's East End called the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee patrolled the streets looking for suspicious characters, petitioned the government to raise a reward for information about the killer, and hired private detectives to question witnesses independently.79 The committee was led by George Lusk in 1888.80
Butchers, slaughterers, surgeons and physicians were suspected because of the manner of the mutilations. A surviving note from Major Henry Smith, Acting Commissioner of the City Police, indicates that the alibis of many local butchers and slaughterers were investigated, with the result that they were all eliminated from the inquiry.81 A report from Inspector Donald Swanson to the Home Office confirms that 76 butchers and slaughterers were visited, and that the inquiry encompassed all their employees for the previous six months.82 Some commentators at the time, including Queen Victoria, thought the pattern of the murders indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle drover on one of the cattle boats that plied between London and mainland Europe. Whitechapel was close to the London Docks,83 and such boats usually docked on Thursday or Friday and departed on Saturday or Sunday.84 The cattle boats were examined, but the dates of the murders did not coincide with a single boat's movements and the transfer of a crewman between boats was also ruled out.85
Criminal profiling
At the end of October, Robert Anderson, head of the London CID, asked police surgeon Thomas Bond to give his opinion as to the extent of the murderer's surgical skill and knowledge.86 The opinion offered by Bond on the character of the &quot;Whitechapel murderer&quot; is the earliest surviving offender profile.87 Bond's assessment was based on his own examination of the most extensively mutilated victim and the post mortem notes from the four previous canonical murders.88 He wrote:

Bond was strongly opposed to the idea that the murderer possessed any kind of scientific or anatomical knowledge, or even &quot;the technical knowledge of a butcher or horse slaughterer&quot;.89 In his opinion the killer must have been a man of solitary habits, subject to &quot;periodical attacks of homicidal and erotic mania&quot;, with the character of the mutilations possibly indicating &quot;satyriasis&quot;.90 Bond also stated that &quot;the homicidal impulse may have developed from a revengeful or brooding condition of the mind, or that religious mania may have been the original disease but I do not think either hypothesis is likely&quot;.91 While there is no evidence of any sexual activity with any the victims,9293 psychologists suppose that the penetration of the victims with a knife and &quot;leaving them on display in sexually degrading positions with the wounds exposed&quot; indicates that the perpetrator derived sexual pleasure from the attacks.9495 This view is challenged by others who dismiss such hypotheses as insupportable supposition.96 Comparisons with the motives and actions of modern-day serial killers have led to suggestions that the Ripper could have been a deranged schizophrenic, like the &quot;Yorkshire Ripper&quot; Peter Sutcliffe, who heard voices instructing him to attack prostitutes.97
Suspects

 The concentration of the killings at the weekend, and within a few streets of each other, has indicated to many that the Ripper was employed during the week and lived locally.98 Others have thought the killer was an educated upper-class man, possibly a doctor, who ventured into Whitechapel from a more well-to-do area;99 such notions draw on cultural perceptions such as fear of the medical profession, distrust of modern science or the exploitation of the poor by the rich.100 Author Stephen Knight promoted an elaborate Masonic conspiracy theory involving the upper-class and a doctor in his 1976 book Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution, but many authors dismiss the theory as a fantasy.101 Suspects proposed years after the murders include virtually anyone remotely connected to the case by contemporary documents, as well as many famous names, who were never considered in the police investigation. As everyone alive at the time is now dead, modern authors are free to accuse anyone they can, &quot;without any need for any supporting historical evidence&quot;.102 Suspects named in contemporary police documents include three in Sir Melville Macnaghten's 1894 memorandum, but the evidence against them is circumstantial at best.103
Despite the many and varied theories about the identity and profession of Jack the Ripper, authorities are not agreed on a single solution and the number of named suspects reaches over one hundred.104105
Letters

Over the course of the Ripper murders, the police, newspapers and others received many hundreds of letters regarding the case.106 Some were well-intentioned offers of advice for catching the killer but the vast majority were deemed useless and subsequently ignored.107
Hundreds of letters claimed to have been written by the killer himself,108 and three of these in particular are prominent: the &quot;Dear Boss&quot; letter, the &quot;Saucy Jacky&quot; postcard and the &quot;From Hell&quot; letter.109
The &quot;Dear Boss&quot; letter, dated 25 September, was postmarked 27 September 1888. It was received that day by the Central News Agency, and was forwarded to Scotland Yard on 29 September.110 Initially it was considered a hoax, but when Eddowes was found three days after the letter's postmark with one ear partially cut off, the letter's promise to &quot;clip the ladys (sic) ears off&quot; gained attention.111 However, Eddowes' ear appears to have been nicked by the killer incidentally during his attack, and the letter writer's threat to send the ears to the police was never carried out.112 The name &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; was first used in this letter by the signatory and gained worldwide notoriety after its publication.113 Most of the letters that followed copied this letter's tone.114 Some sources list another letter, dated 17 September 1888, as the first to use the name of Jack the Ripper, but most experts believe this was a modern fake inserted into police records in the 20th century, long after the killings took place.115  The &quot;Saucy Jacky&quot; postcard was postmarked 1 October 1888 and received the same day by the Central News Agency. The handwriting was similar to the &quot;Dear Boss&quot; letter.116 It mentions that two victims were killed very close to one another: &quot;double event this time&quot;, which was thought to refer to the murders of Stride and Eddowes.117 It has been argued that the letter was mailed before the murders were publicised, making it unlikely that a crank would have such knowledge of the crime, but it was postmarked more than 24 hours after the killings took place, long after details were known by journalists and residents of the area.118  The &quot;From Hell&quot; letter was received by George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee on 16 October 1888. The handwriting and style is unlike that of the &quot;Dear Boss&quot; letter and postcard.119 The letter came with a small box in which Lusk discovered half of a human kidney, preserved in &quot;spirits of wine&quot; (ethanol).120 One of Eddowes' kidneys had been removed by the killer. The writer claimed that he &quot;fried and ate&quot; the missing kidney half. There is disagreement over the kidney: some contend it belonged to Eddowes, while others argue it was nothing more than a macabre practical joke.121122
Scotland Yard published facsimiles of the &quot;Dear Boss&quot; letter and the postcard on 3 October, in the ultimately vain hope that someone would recognise the handwriting.123 In a letter to Godfrey Lushington, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, Charles Warren explained &quot;I think the whole thing a hoax but of course we are bound to try &amp; ascertain the writer in any case.&quot;124 On 7 October 1888, George R. Sims in the Sunday newspaper Referee implied scathingly that the letter was written by a journalist &quot;to hurl the circulation of a newspaper sky high&quot;.125 Police officials later claimed to have identified a specific journalist as the author of both the &quot;Dear Boss&quot; letter and the postcard.126 The journalist was identified as Tom Bullen in a letter from Chief Inspector John George Littlechild to George R. Sims dated 23 September 1913.127 A journalist called Fred Best reportedly confessed in 1931 that he'd written the letters to &quot;keep the business alive&quot;.128
Dr Thomas Openshaw was frequently mentioned in press reports at the time in connection with the kidney and &quot;From Hell&quot; letter sent to George Lusk. On 29 October 1888 he received a letter through the post addressed to 'Dr Openshaw, Pathological curator, London Hospital, Whitechapel' and signed Jack the Ripper. This letter has become known as the Openshaw Letter.129
Media
 The Ripper murders mark an important watershed in the treatment of crime by journalists.130131 While not the first serial killer, Jack the Ripper's case was the first to create a worldwide media frenzy.132133 Tax reforms in the 1850s had enabled the publication of inexpensive newspapers with wider circulation.134 These mushroomed later in the Victorian era to include mass-circulation newspapers as cheap as a halfpenny, along with popular magazines such as the Illustrated Police News, which made the Ripper the beneficiary of previously unparalleled publicity.135
After the murder of Nichols in early September, the Manchester Guardian reported that: &quot;Whatever information may be in the possession of the police they deem it necessary to keep secretÂ ... It is believed their attention is particularly directed to... a notorious character known as 'Leather Apron'.&quot;136 Journalists were frustrated by the unwillingness of the CID to reveal details of their investigation to the public, and so resorted to writing reports of questionable veracity.137138 Imaginative descriptions of &quot;Leather Apron&quot; appeared in the press,139 but rival journalists dismissed these as &quot;a mythical outgrowth of the reporter's fancy&quot;.140 John Pizer, a local Jew who made footwear from leather, was known by the name &quot;Leather Apron&quot;141 and was arrested, even though the investigating inspector reported that &quot;at present there is no evidence whatsoever against him&quot;.142 He was soon released after the confirmation of his alibis.143
After the publication of the &quot;Dear Boss&quot; letter, &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; supplanted &quot;Leather Apron&quot; as the name adopted by the press and public to describe the killer.144 The name &quot;Jack&quot; was already used to describe another fabled London attacker: &quot;Spring-Heeled Jack&quot;, who supposedly leapt over walls to strike at his victims and escape as quickly as he came.145 The invention and adoption of a nickname for a particular killer became standard media practice with examples such as the Axeman of New Orleans, the Boston Strangler, and the Beltway Sniper. Examples derived from Jack the Ripper include the French Ripper, the D&lt;U+00FC&gt;sseldorf Ripper, the Camden Ripper, Jack the Stripper, the Yorkshire Ripper, and the Rostov Ripper . Sensational press reports, combined with the fact that no one was ever convicted of the murders, has confused scholarly analysis and created a legend that casts a shadow over later serial killers.146
Legacy
 In addition to the contradictions and unreliability of contemporary accounts, attempts to identify the real killer are hampered by the lack of surviving forensic evidence.147 DNA analysis on extant letters is inconclusive;148 the available material has been handled many times and is too contaminated to provide meaningful results.149 To date more than 150 non-fiction works deal exclusively with the Jack the Ripper murders,150 making it one of the most written-about true-crime subjects.151 The term &quot;ripperology&quot; was coined by Colin Wilson in 1976 to describe the study of the case by professionals and amateurs.152153 Six periodicals about Jack the Ripper have been introduced since the early 1990s: Ripperana (1992&lt;U+2013&gt;present), Ripperologist (1994&lt;U+2013&gt;present, electronic format only since 2005), the Whitechapel Journal (1997&lt;U+2013&gt;2000), Ripper Notes (1999&lt;U+2013&gt;present), Ripperoo (2000&lt;U+2013&gt;2003), and the The Whitechapel Society 1888 Journal (2005&lt;U+2013&gt;present).154
The nature of the murders and of the victims drew attention to the poor living conditions in the East End,155 and galvanised public opinion against the overcrowded, insanitary slums.156 In the two decades after the murders, the worst of the slums were cleared and demolished,157 but the streets and some buildings survive and the legend of the Ripper is still promoted by guided tours of the murder sites.158 The Ten Bells public house in Commercial Street was frequented by at least one of the victims and was the focus of such tours for many years.159
Jack the Ripper features in hundreds of works of fiction and works which straddle the boundaries between both fact and fiction, including the Ripper letters and a hoax Diary of Jack the Ripper.160 The Ripper appears in novels, short stories, poetry, comic books, games, songs, plays, films, and the 1930s opera Lulu by Alban Berg.
In the immediate aftermath of the murders, and later, &quot;Jack the Ripper became the children's bogey man.&quot;161 Depictions were often phantasmic or monstrous. In the 1920s and 1930s, he was depicted in film dressed in everyday clothes as a man with a hidden secret preying on his unsuspecting victims; atmosphere and evil were suggested through lighting effects and shadowplay.162 By the 1960s, the Ripper had become &quot;the symbol of a predatory aristocracy&quot;,163 and was portrayed in a top hat dressed as a gentleman. The Establishment as a whole became the villain with the Ripper acting as a manifestation of upper-class exploitation.164 The image of the Ripper merged or borrowed symbols from horror stories, such as Dracula's cloak or Victor Frankenstein's organ harvest.165 The fictional world of the Ripper can fuse with multiple genres, ranging from Sherlock Holmes to Japanese erotic horror.166
Unlike murderers of lesser fame, there is no waxwork figure of Jack the Ripper at Madame Tussauds' Chamber of Horrors, in accordance with their policy of not modelling persons whose likeness is unknown.167 He is instead depicted as a shadow.168 In 2006, Jack the Ripper was selected by BBC History magazine and its readers as the worst Briton in history.169170
