Peter Michael Wolf, a sixth-generation member of the Godchaux-Weis family, was born in New Orleans.1 He is the author of several books, as well as the memoir, My New Orleans, Gone Away &lt;U+2013&gt; A Memoir of Loss and Renewal. Wolf attended Metairie Park Country Day School, Phillips Exeter Academy, Yale University (BA), Tulane University (MA), and New York University Institute of Fine Arts (PhD). At Yale, he was elected to the Manuscript Society and the Elizabethan Club, and served as a board member and the publicity manager of the Yale Daily News.2 During his graduate studies, he was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship in Paris. His doctoral dissertation was published internationally in 1968, Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne H&lt;U+00E9&gt;nard and the Beginning of Urbanism in Paris 1900&lt;U+2013&gt;1914. In 1969, it became the basis for a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.3
Wolf has been awarded grants for his writing and scholarship by the Ford Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts, and the National Research and Education Trust Fund. He has twice been a visiting artist/scholar at the American Academy in Rome.
Wolf's career in urbanism began at Wilbur Smith Associates, where he engaged in land planning focused on transportation. Between 1977 and 1987 he was an adjunct professor at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. He was also active as a chairman of the Board of Fellows and a trustee of the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies. During this period, besides independent writing and consulting, he participated in a number of IAUS studies, including: co-director with architect Peter Eisenman of &quot;The Street as a Component of the Urban Environment&quot; (1971&lt;U+2013&gt;1973); co-director with professor Kenneth Frampton of &quot;Low-Rise High-Density Prototype&quot; (1971&lt;U+2013&gt;1973);4 and director, Union Square Redevelopment Program (1972&lt;U+2013&gt;1973).
As an adjunct professor at the Cooper Union's School of Architecture, during the tenure of Dean John Hejduk, Wolf taught classes in urbanism. During this time he authored numerous studies related to land use, open space planning, and published articles on the matter. This work was commissioned by governmental agencies, corporations, nonprofit entities, and communities, including the Office of the Manhattan Borough President, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Pan American World Airways, and private land owners across the US.5

His study, &quot;Shaker Heritage Historic District,&quot; commissioned by the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York State Council on the Arts, the Shaker Central Trust Fund, and the Historical Society of the Town of Colonie, New York, was instrumental in saving the first Shaker settlement in America, a National Register of Historic Places property.6
In 1987, as the consultant to the Village of East Hampton, he rewrote the East Hampton Village Residential Zoning Ordinance and, in 2002, he served as senior advisor to the Town of East Hampton Comprehensive Plan. 7 In 2010, he founded and served as the chairman of the Thomas Moran Trust, a nonprofit dedicated to the restoration of the Thomas Moran House (American painter Thomas Moran and printmaker Mary Nimmo Moran's studio house and gardens), a National Historic Property. In 2012, he was appointed to the Advisory Committee of the Quiet Skies Coalition, a group that seeks to preserve the well-being of communities on the easternmost reaches of Long Island suffering from noise pollution created by increasing air traffic. To further this cause, he created, with Kenneth Lipper, an independent initiative to obtain legislative approval of strict noise control, including an East Hampton airport curfew. 8
