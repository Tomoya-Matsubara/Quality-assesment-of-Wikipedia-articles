Hylton v. United States, 3 U.S. 171 (1796), was an early United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a tax on carriages did not violate the direct tax clause by defining the carriage tax as an &quot;excise&quot; instead of a &quot;direct tax&quot; that would have had to be apportioned among the states by population. This interpretation of the federal tax power lasted until modified in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co. (1895), in which the Supreme Court held an unapportioned 1894 federal income tax on interest, dividends and rents to be unconstitutional because the tax was a &quot;direct tax&quot; that had to be apportioned. The Pollock decision was overturned by the Sixteenth Amendment (1913), which allows the Congress to impose a tax on incomes from &quot;whatever source derived&quot; without any requirement for apportionment.
The Justices at the time, rather than issue an opinion of the Court, instead issued seriatim opinions, with each writing separately and reading their own analysis in turn. This case was the first time Judicial Review came up in the United States Supreme Court. The Court heard the case about upholding the federal carriage tax, and found it constitutional. The power of Judicial Review was not controversial until Marbury v. Madison in 1803.
Alexander Hamilton appeared before court for the government, arguing that the tax was a valid use of the power of Congress. Justice James Iredell wrote, two days after the event: &quot;Mr. Hamilton spoke in our Court, attended by the most crowded audience I ever saw there, both Houses of Congress being almost deserted on the occasion. Though he was in very ill health, he spoke with astonishing ability, and in a most pleasing manner, and was listened to with the profoundest attention. His speech lasted about three hours.&quot;
