Public image

Minaj has been noted by the media for her curvaceous figure.92939495 In an interview with Vibe Minaj discussed her sexual image stating, &quot;when I grew up I saw females doing certain things, and I thought I had to do that exactly. The female rappers of my day spoke about sex a lot... and I thought that to have the success they got, I would have to represent the same thing. When in fact I didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t have to represent the same thing.&quot;96 In an interview with Interview, Minaj commented on her sexual image again stating, &quot;I made a conscious decision to try to tone down the sexiness, I want people&lt;U+2014&gt;especially young girls&lt;U+2014&gt;to know that in life, nothing is going to be based on sex appeal. You got to have something else to go with that.&lt;U+201D&gt;97 Minaj has made &quot;signing boobs&quot; part of her movement to empower women.98 In an interview with The Guardian, Minaj says she is to not only competing with females, but also the male rappers in the industry. &quot;That's why I say stuff like, 'Dick in your face', because I don't even wanna refer to female genitalia any more,&quot; Minaj said, recalling the song &quot;Come on a Cone&quot; from her sophomoric album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded. &quot;I just feel I have bigger balls than the boys.&quot; 99 In her &quot;Moment 4 Life&quot;, song she refers herself as a king instead of the term &quot;queen&quot;.100
Minaj is known for wearing outlandish costumes and wigs and is often compared to pop-singer, Lady Gaga, and is often called &quot;the black Lady Gaga&quot;; Minaj refutes comparisons between the two.101 She cites Alexander McQueen, Versace, and Christian Louboutin as her favorite designers.102 The Huffington Post described Minaj's fashion as &quot;risk-taking&quot;, &quot;bold sartorial choices&quot;, and &quot;far-out&quot;,103 with Yahoo! commenting that her costume was &quot;colorful&quot;, &quot;crazy&quot; and stated that &quot;the world would certainly be very quiet without Ms Minaj&quot;.104 Minaj has been invited to attend various events for fashion designers.

She also performed her hit single &quot;Super Bass&quot; at a Victoria Secret fashion show in November 2011.105 Minaj was personally invited to be sat with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour during New York Fashion Week to see designers such as Oscar de la Renta and Carolina Herrera.106

She is the most followed rapper in the world.108 In March 2011, Billboard named Minaj the fourth most active musician on social media, through their Social 50 chart.109 Upon Twitter and in public appearances and interviews, Minaj refers to her fans as the &quot;Barbz&quot;, and her gay following as &quot;Ken-barbz&quot; 110111112 something that derives from her alter-ego as the &quot;Harajaku Barbie&quot;. Minaj deleted her Twitter account for 8 days in April 2012, following a dispute between her and fans who wanted to leak snippets of her then unreleased album.113
Alter egos
While growing up, Minaj's home life was often chaotic, with her parents constantly fighting.114 As a means of escape, she would create characters and live her life through them.115 In an interview with New York she stated, &quot;To get away from all their fighting, I would imagine being a new person. 'Cookie' was my first identity &lt;U+2013&gt; that stayed with me for a while. I went on to 'Harajuku Barbie,' then 'Nicki Minaj'. Fantasy was my reality.&quot;116
On November 18, 2010, Minaj assumed an alter-ego named &quot;Nicki Teresa&quot;.117 Wearing a colorful scarf around her head, she went around as the &quot;healer to her fans&quot; as she visited them at The Garden of Dreams Foundation at Fuse studios in New York City.118 Minaj made an appearance on Lopez Tonight on December 6, 2010 and presented a different alter-ego for the Spanish-inspired occasion, named &quot;Rosa&quot; (pronounced Rrrrrosa).119

For her debut album, Minaj created another alter-ego named &quot;Roman Zolanski&quot;.120 She stated that in songs like &quot;Bottoms Up&quot; with Trey Songz it is not Minaj rapping, but instead Roman Zolanski, and claims that Roman is her &quot;twin brother&quot;. She claims that he was born inside her, out of rage, and becomes him when she is angry. She has also said 'He is a demon inside her'. Roman has been compared to Eminem's alter ego Slim Shady, and on the song &quot;Roman's Revenge&quot; from Pink Friday, Minaj and Eminem collaborate, using these alter egos.121 On the collaboration, she said &quot;The new album is going to have a lot of Roman on it ... And if you're not familiar with Roman, then you will be familiar with him very soon. He&lt;U+2019&gt;s the boy that lives inside of me. He's a lunatic and he's gay and he'll be on there a lot.&quot;122 Roman also has a &quot;mother&quot; called &quot;Martha Zolanski&quot;,123 who also appeared on the song &quot;Roman's Revenge&quot;, with a British accent,124 and on &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;, singing for the first time.125126 Martha appears in the video for &quot;Moment 4 Life&quot; where she appears to be Minaj's magical godmother. In songs such as &quot;All I Do Is Win (Remix)&quot; it is Minaj rapping.127 Minaj stated that on her debut album, fans will get to &quot;meet&quot; Nicki, Roman and Onika.128
In April 2012, Minaj was asked if Roman, Martha, and Rosa come out in the bedroom. She told Big Boy during his &quot;Backstage Breakfast&quot;, &quot;No, they don&lt;U+2019&gt;t come out in the bedroom, but other people come out in the bedroom,&quot; adding, &quot;And there's only one person that would know who that personality is&quot;. Minaj has not specified which alter-ego since.129
Rapping technique

Minaj is known for her animated rapping style, and her distinctive flow separates her from other female rappers. She often combines metaphors, punchlines, and wordplay into her work, which has received comparisons to her mentor, Lil Wayne. The New York Times described Minaj as &quot;a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones.&quot;130 Many critics describe her rap technique as bubblegum rap, but Minaj explained in an interview with Vibe magazine: &quot;What people don't know is that before I was doing that craziness I was doing me, I was just doing regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once I started doing all that weird [expletive]&lt;U+2014&gt;im not mad at it because it got everyone&lt;U+2019&gt;s attention&quot;.131
Her verse in Kanye West's &quot;Monster&quot; was well received by critics, with many stating she had the best verse in the song, beating out well-established hip-hop artists Kanye West, Jay-Z, and Rick Ross.132 Her alter-egos come alive in her lyrics varying from a British accent, to her soft-spoken Harajuku Barbie. She has collaborated with a diverse array of musical artists from varied genres, including Britney Spears, Eminem, and Madonna. Hip-hop artist Ice-T cosigns Minaj's rapping ability with an interview from Rolling Stone &quot;She [Minaj] does her thing. She has her own way of doing it. She has an ill vocal delivery. She kind of reminds me of a female Busta Rhymes, like how she throws her voice in different directions &lt;U+2013&gt; but she's no Lil' Kim&quot;.133
Billboard dissected Minaj's rap technique, saying, &quot;Her multiple characters are indeed present on the set. In a matter of bars, Minaj switches effortlessly from the toned-down Onika to the energetic Nicki and then to her tempestuous alter ego, Roman Zolanski. She tosses off British and Jamaican accents, animal-like growls, breathy vocals and rapid-fire rhymes with the blink-and-you'll-miss-it speed of a 14-year-old girl thumbing a text message in homeroom.&quot;134
Influences

Minaj has stated that artists who have influenced her musical style include Lisa &quot;Left Eye&quot; Lopes, Lil Wayne, Lauryn Hill, Jadakiss, Natasha Bedingfield, Foxy Brown, Lil' Kim and Missy Elliott.135136 She was also inspired by Janet Jackson,137 Madonna, Britney Spears, Marilyn Monroe, Grace Jones,138 M.I.A. and Cyndi Lauper.139140141
Minaj cites Foxy Brown and Jay-Z as influences, saying, &quot;I really loved her [Foxy] as a female rapper. I was really interested in her mind and her aura, I was really, really into Jay-Z. Me and my friends in high school, we were reciting all of the Jay lyrics. His words were our words in our conversations all the time.&quot;142 Minaj spoke on her love for Foxy Brown again during an interview with MTV, saying she was &quot;the most influential female rapper&quot; and how [Foxy] her album Broken Silence&quot; changed her life. Minaj went on &quot;I never really told Foxy how much she has influenced me and how much she changed my life, and you've gotta tell people that when they're alive to even be able to take the compliment, instead of paying tribute to them when they're no longer here,&quot;.143
Jada Pinkett Smith is one of Minaj's influences as an actress, and has been mentioned as a role model in her acting career.144 Minaj was inspired by R&amp;B singer Monica, and used to sing her song &quot;Why I Love You So Much&quot; at every talent show she was in. Minaj referred to Monica as one of her biggest musical influences of all time whilst performing in Atlanta on her Pink Friday Tour.145 Kanye West, Trina, and Drake have been named as influences to Minaj.146 Betsey Johnson is another one of Minaj's fashion icon's during an interview with MTV, Minaj expressed her love for Johnson &quot;[Betsey] She's a free spirit,&quot; Minaj said of Johnson. &quot;When I met her the other day, I felt like I knew her for my whole life. She's so warm and considerate and caring. She's amazingly talented and I've been wearing her clothes forever, so to meet her was like, 'Yay!' [I was] bowing down to her; she's dope!&quot;147

Critics have noted Minaj's use of various sexual identities within her music,178 with some implying that she is bisexual.179 However, she has said that she does not date nor have sex with women,180 but added in an interview with Out magazine, &quot;I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t date men either.&quot;181 In an interview with Vibe she commented, &quot;I just embrace all people of all lifestyles and I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t tell them they are bad people. But I feel like people always wanna define me and I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t wanna be defined.&quot;182
Feud with Lil' Kim

Minaj has been embroiled in a feud with veteran rapper, Lil' Kim, since she gained her breakthrough success with Pink Friday. With Kim and critics noticing resemblances with her on the Sucka Free mixtape,183 Kim accused Minaj of copying her image saying, &quot;If you are going to steal my swag, you gonna have to pay. Something gotta give. You help me, I help you. That's how it goes to me.184 Minaj's single &quot;Roman's Revenge&quot; with Eminem was believed by critics to be a response to Kim's comments,185 although she later denied this,186 she responded to the situation in an interview with HOT 97's Angie Martinez saying &quot;She picked a fight with Foxy, then she picked a fight with Eve, then she picked a fight a fight with Remy, then it was Mrs. Wallace, then it was Nicki Minaj. Every time you in the news, it&lt;U+2019&gt;s &lt;U+2018&gt;cause you gettin&lt;U+2019&gt; at somebody! Where&lt;U+2019&gt;s your music? Put your music out, and when I see your name on Billboard, that&lt;U+2019&gt;s when I&lt;U+2019&gt;ll respond to you. Other than that, goodbye. It&lt;U+2019&gt;s Barbie, bitch.&quot;187
Lil' Kim reignited the feud following the release of her mixtape Black Friday, an album that directly referenced Minaj, through the title and songs such as &quot;Did It On'em&quot; (that became &quot;Pissin' On'em&quot;); the album artwork also portrayed Lil' Kim decapitating Minaj with a sword.188 A fragment of a diss track called &quot;Tragedy&quot; was released in response by Minaj in April 2011, the track featured the lyrics &quot;Pink Friday, Eminem, 8 Mile/ It must hurt to sell your album on PayPal.&quot; and &quot;Look at you now hoe, you just tragic&quot;.189 Following the release of Minaj's second album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, critics suggested that the track &quot;Stupid Hoe&quot;190 may have contained attacks directed at Kim. Lil' Kim later suggested in an interview with 105's Breakfast Club that the song &quot;Automatic&quot; from Minaj's second album was similar to her unreleased material, also calling Minaj &quot;obnoxious&quot; and &quot;catty&quot;.191
The feud has drawn attention from various other recording artists and rappers. Minaj's labelmate and rapper, Drake said &quot;[he] didn't give a [expletive] what Lil Kim or nobody else is talking about.&quot;192 50 Cent commented on the situation in an online interview with Power 98.3 FM remarking, &quot;It's obvious ... she [Minaj] was inspired by some of Kim's [style]. But that's not bad. There's not a whole lot of female artists that you can make reference to, so you'll see those little influences even stronger. I think she's hot &lt;U+2014&gt; I think she's got a good little thing going right now, as far as Nicki Minaj is concerned.&quot;193 Diddy spoke of his love and respect for Kim, attributing his personal success, in part, to her, however he defended working with Minaj stating that &quot;I wouldn't be around Nicki if I ever heard anything negative said about Kim. I've never heard anything like that.&quot;194 Mary J. Blige commented on the rivalry, saying, &quot;Kim is my friend and I love and respect Nicki, just met her and got to know the young lady and she's a sweetheart.&quot;, adding that the feud had arisen because of &quot;crews&quot; behind it.195

&quot;...Nicki was a little girl in Trinidad who missed her mom. Born in 1984, Onika Tanya Maraj spent her first five years in a clown-car of a house, full of cousins and friends and animals. Like lots of people awaiting entry to the United States, Nicki idealized what her life would be like once she got to New York. &quot;↩
