Team owner
LJ Racing
 Falk entered NASCAR team ownership in the Winston Cup Series (now the Sprint Cup Series) in 1997, fielding the No. 91 Chevrolet in a partnership with Ron Neal under the LJ Racing banner, with driver Mike Wallace and sponsorship from Spam. The team struggled to make races,5 and Wallace was released midway through the season;6 Spam left the team shortly thereafter, and several other drivers drove the car later in the year, with little additional success. Kevin Lepage joined the team towards the end of the year, and would drive the No. 91 through the first half of 1998 before leaving to join Roush Racing.7 He was replaced by Morgan Shepherd, and then Todd Bodine, who would score the team's best finish, fifth, in the final race of the 1998 season at Atlanta Motor Speedway.8
LJ Racing entered the 1999 season with driver Steve Grissom;9 Grissom was released after failing to qualify for two of the first four races,10 being replaced by Dick Trickle, who drove for the team for most of the remainder of the year.11 The team would qualify for two races in 2000, at Atlanta and Richmond with Todd Bodine driving, before closing down.12
LTD Powersports
Falk returned to team ownership in the Sprint Cup Series in 2011, running the No. 50 for LTD Powersports with driver T.J. Bell on a limited basis starting with the Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway.13 Bell competed for Rookie of the Year during the season,14 but only qualified for five races, four of them with Falk's team, which failed to qualify for nine additional races.15
Hillman and Childress
For the 2012 season, Falk joined Hillman Racing, owned by former Cup Series crew chief and Germain Racing team manager Mike Hillman, as a partial owner; the team attempted to qualify for the 2012 Daytona 500 with driver Michael Waltrip,16 but failed to make the race.17 Falk also co-owns Hillman Racing's Camping World Truck Series team with drivers Ward and Jeb Burton; a second truck for Falk's nephew, C. E. Falk, is hoped to be run later in the season.18
In April 2012, Falk announced that he was purchasing the No. 33 Sprint Cup Series team from Richard Childress Racing.19 The team, one Childress had planned to run for only the first five races of the season,20 was transferred to Falk's ownership after the race at Martinsville Speedway; Falk planned to run a number of drivers in the car over the remainder of the season, including Tony Raines,21 Jeff Green, Austin Dillon, Hermie and Elliott Sadler, and C. E. Falk.22
