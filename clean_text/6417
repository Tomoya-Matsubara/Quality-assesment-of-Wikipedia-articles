Cindy Lou Hensley McCain (born May 20, 1954) is an American businesswoman, and philanthropist, and the wife of United States Senator and 2000 and 2008 presidential candidate John McCain of Arizona.
She was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona as the daughter of wealthy beer distributor Jim Hensley. After receiving bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Southern California, she became a special education teacher. She married John McCain in 1980 and they had three children together as well as adopting another. From 1988 to 1995 she founded and ran a non-profit organization, the American Voluntary Medical Team, that organized trips by medical personnel to disaster-struck or war-torn third-world areas. During this time she became addicted to painkillers for several years and resorted to having a physician write illegal prescriptions; she reached an agreement with the government in which no charges were filed against her.
Upon her father's death in 2000, she inherited majority control and became chair of Hensley &amp; Co., one of the largest Anheuser-Busch beer distributors in the United States. She participated in both of her husband's presidential campaigns and in 2008 drew both positive and negative scrutiny for her appearance, demeanor, wealth, spending habits, and financial obligations. She continues to be an active philanthropist and serves on the boards of Operation Smile, CARE and HALO Trust, frequently making overseas trips in conjunction with their activities.
Early life and education
Cindy Lou Hensley was born in Phoenix, Arizona,1 to James Hensley, who founded Hensley &amp; Co.,2 and Marguerite &quot;Smitty&quot; Hensley (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Johnson).345 She was raised as the only child of her parents' second marriages6 and grew up on Phoenix's North Central Avenue in affluent circumstances.789 (Dixie L. Burd, who is the daughter of Marguerite Smith through a prior relationship, is her half-sister,10 as is Kathleen Hensely Portalski, daughter of Jim Hensley and his first wife, Mary Jeanne Parks.1112) Cindy Hensley was named Junior Rodeo Queen of Arizona in 1968.1314 She went to Central High School15 in Phoenix, where she was named Best Dressed as a senior and graduated in 1972.1617
Hensley enrolled at the University of Southern California.18 She joined the socially conservative Kappa Alpha Theta sorority as a freshman,1920 and had many leadership roles in the house during her four years there.21 Hensley graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in education in 1976.2223 She continued on at USC, and received a Master of Arts in special education in 1978.2425 There she participated in a movement therapy pilot program that laid the way for a standard treatment for children with severe disabilities;26 she published the work Movement Therapy: A Possible Approach in 1978.27 Declining a role in the family business,28 she worked for a year as a special education teacher dealing with children with Down syndrome and other disabilities at Agua Fria High School in Avondale, Arizona.29303132
Marriage and family
 Hensley met John McCain in April 1979 at a military reception in Hawaii.33 He was the U.S. Navy liaison officer to the United States Senate and almost eighteen years her senior.34 McCain and Hensley quickly began a relationship,35 traveling between Arizona and Washington to see each other.36 John McCain then pushed to end his marriage of fourteen years;37 Carol McCain and John McCain stopped cohabiting in January 1980,38 and Carol accepted a divorce in February 1980,39 effective in April 1980. John and Cindy were married on May 17, 1980 at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix.40 They signed a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name;41 they have since kept their finances apart and file separate income tax returns.42
Her father's business and political contacts helped gain John McCain a foothold in Arizona politics.43 She campaigned with her husband door-to-door during his successful first bid for U.S. Congress in 1982,44 and was heavily involved in campaign strategy.45 Her wealth from an expired trust from her parents provided significant loans to the campaign464748 and helped it survive a period of early debt.49
Once John McCain was elected, the couple moved to Alexandria, Virginia.50 She spent two months in late 1983 writing handwritten notes on over 4,000 Christmas cards to be sent to constituents and others.51 She was considered an outsider who was snubbed by the Washington congressional social scene, in part because Carol McCain was a popular figure in town,52 and she grew homesick for Arizona.5354 She suffered several miscarriages.5556
She moved back to Arizona in early 1984,57 and gave birth to her child Meghan later that year.58 She subsequently had John Sidney IV (known as &quot;Jack&quot;), born 1986, and James (known as &quot;Jimmy&quot;), born 1988.59 Their fourth child, Bridget, was adopted in 1991. Cindy McCain's parents lived across the street and helped her raise the children; her husband was frequently in Washington and she typically only saw him on weekends.6061 She organized elaborate fundraisers for him and expanded their home.62
In April 1986, she and her father invested $359,100 in a shopping center project with Phoenix banker Charles Keating.63 This, combined with her role as a bookkeeper who later had difficulty finding receipts for family trips on Keating's jet,64 caused complications for her husband during the Keating Five scandal, when he was being examined for his role regarding oversight of Keating's bank.65
American Voluntary Medical Team
Founding and mission
In 1988, inspired by a vacation visit four years earlier to substandard medical facilities on Truk Lagoon,6667 Cindy McCain founded the American Voluntary Medical Team (AVMT).68 It was a non-profit organization that organized trips for doctors, nurses and other medical personnel to provide MASH-like emergency medical care to disaster-struck or war-torn third-world areas such as Micronesia, Vietnam (before relations were normalized between them and the U.S.69), Kuwait (arriving five days after the conclusion of the Gulf War70), Zaire (to help refuges from the Rwandan genocide71), Iraq, Nicaragua, India, Bangladesh and El Salvador.7273747576 She led 55 of these missions over the next seven years,77 each of which were at least two weeks in duration.78 AVMT also supplied treatment to poor sick children around the world.79 In 1993, Cindy McCain and the AVMT were honored with an award from Food for the Hungry.80
Adoption
In 1991, the AVMT went to Dhaka, Bangladesh, to provide assistance following the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone.81 While at Mother Teresa's Dhaka orphanage, the Sisters of Charity of Mother Teresa Children's Home,82 McCain met two infant girls she felt needed to be brought to the United States for medical treatment.83 She decided to adopt one of the girls, later named Bridget, with her husband readily agreeing;84 the adoption became final in 1993.85 She helped coordinate the adoption of the other little girl, named Mickey, for family friend Wes Gullett.86
Prescription drug addiction
In 1989, Cindy McCain became addicted to Percocet and Vicodin, opioid painkillers, which she initially took to alleviate pain following two spinal surgeries for ruptured discs and to ease emotional stress during the Keating Five affair.8788899091 The addiction progressed to where she was taking upwards of twenty pills a day,92 and she resorted to having an AVMT physician write illegal prescriptions in the names of three AVMT employees without their knowledge.9394 In 1992, her parents staged an intervention to force her to get help;95 she told her husband about her problem, attended a drug treatment facility, began outpatient sessions and ended her three years of addiction.96 Surgery in 1993 resolved her back pain.9798
In January 1993, Tom Gosinski, an AVMT employee who had discovered her illegal drug use, was terminated on budgetary grounds.99 Subsequently, he tipped off the Drug Enforcement Administration about her prior actions, and a federal investigation ensued.100101 McCain's defense team, led by John McCain's Keating Five lawyer John Dowd, secured an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's office for McCain, a first-time offender, which avoided charges while requiring her to pay financial restitution, enroll in a diversion program and do community service.102103104 Meanwhile, in early 1994 Gosinski filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against McCain, which he told her he would settle for $250,000.105106 In response, Dowd characterized this request as blackmail and requested that officials investigate Gosinski for extortion.107108 In the end, both Gosinski's lawsuit and the extortion investigation against him were dropped.109110
Knowing that the DEA prosecutors were about to publicly disclose her past addiction, McCain preemptively revealed the story to reporters, saying she was doing so willingly: &quot;Although my conduct did not result in compromising any missions of AVMT, my actions were wrong, and I regret them.&quot;111112113
Aftermath
AVMT concluded its activities in 1995 in the wake of the McCain narcotics prescriptions controversy.114115 That year, McCain founded a new organization, the Hensley Family Foundation, which donates monies towards children's programs in Arizona and nationally.116 She was largely a stay-at-home mom during the balance of the 1990s.117 She also held positions as vice president, director, and vice chair of Hensley &amp; Co.118119
Role in 2000 presidential campaign
Although wary of the media,120 McCain was active in her husband's eventually unsuccessful campaign for President of the United States in 2000.121 She mostly provided good cheer, without discussing her opinions about national policy. She impressed Republican voters with her elegance at coffee shops and other small campaign settings, where she frequently referred to her children, carpooling and charity work.122
She was upset by the notorious smear tactics123124 against her husband in the South Carolina primary that year. These included allegations involving her adopted daughter Bridget that she found &quot;despicable&quot;,125 as well as insinuations that McCain herself was currently a drug addict.126127 Cindy McCain eventually forgave those responsible.128 She was chosen as the chair of the Arizona delegation to the 2000 Republican National Convention.129
Between presidential campaigns

John and Cindy McCain at a Naval Sea Cadet Corps graduation, Fort Dix, New Jersey, July 2001.

In 2000, she became chair of the now $300-million-a-year Hensley &amp; Co.130131 following her father's death.132 It is one of the largest Anheuser-Busch beer distributors in the United States.133 She, her children, and one of John McCain's children from his first marriage, together own 68 percent of the company.134 As chair, her role takes the form of consultations with the company CEO on major initiatives such as new products, new plants or employee welfare, rather than that of an active physical presence.135136 She does not have operational control of Hensley, and Anheuser-Busch considers her to be an absentee owner.137 By 2007, she had an annual income of over $400,000 from Hensley and an estimated net worth of $100 million.138 She also owned at least $2.7 million worth of shares of Anheuser-Busch stock.139140 With her children, she owns a minority stake in the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team.141
She became actively involved with Operation Smile in 2001,142 taking parts in its medical missions to Morocco, Vietnam and India.143 She was honored by the organization in 2005144 and sits on its board of directors.145 She joined the board of directors of CARE in 2005.146 She is on the board of the HALO Trust,147 and has visited operations to remove landmines in Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Mozambique, and Angola.148 She makes financial contributions to these organizations via her family trust149 and views her role as watching them in the field to ensure they are frugal and their money is being spent effectively.150 On occasion she has criticized foreign regimes on human rights grounds, such as Myanmar's military junta.151
In April 2004, McCain suffered a near-fatal stroke caused by high blood pressure,152153 although she was still able to attend some events.154 After several months of physical therapy to overcome her leg and arm limitations, she made a mostly full recovery, although she still suffered from some short-term memory loss and difficulties in writing.155 She owns a home in Coronado, California, next to the Hotel del Coronado;156 her family had vacationed in Coronado growing up, and she has gone there for recuperation and family get-togethers.157 She or her family own other residential and commercial real estate in California, Arizona and Virginia158 and, including rental properties, McCain herself owns ten homes and part of three office complexes.159160161 She is an amateur pilot and race car driver.162
Role in 2008 presidential campaign
 She was active and visible in her husband's second presidential campaign during 2007 and 2008,163 but frequently returned to Arizona to attend to domestic duties164 or interrupted campaigning for her overseas charitable work.165166 She preferred to travel with her husband and introduce him rather than act as a campaign surrogate with a separate schedule.167168 In August 2008, a member of the public shook her hand very vigorously, aggravating her existing carpal tunnel syndrome condition and causing her to slightly sprain her wrist.169 The campaign exacerbated her 15-year history of migraine headaches and she sometimes had to wear dark glasses to shield herself from bright lights.170
McCain stated that the American public wanted a First Lady of the United States who would tend toward a traditional role in that position.171 She would not attend Cabinet meetings,172 but would continue her involvement in overseas non-profit organizations and would urge Americans to do the same globally or locally.173 She envisioned herself as a possible figurehead for humanitarian work, along the lines of Diana, Princess of Wales.174 She continued to expand her roles in such organizations, joining in April 2008 the board of Grateful Nation Montana, which provides scholarships and services to the children of Montana service personnel killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.175
 She made statements critical of the Bush administration for not deploying enough troops during the Iraq War,176 and was an internal critic within the McCain campaign of its profligate spending during the first part of 2007.177 In February 2008, McCain made news by being critical of Michelle Obama, the wife of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, who had said, &quot;And let me tell you something: For the first time in my adult lifetime I am really proud of my country.&quot; McCain replied: &quot;I am proud of my country. I don't know about you&lt;U+2014&gt;if you heard those words earlier&lt;U+2014&gt;I am very proud of my country.&quot;178 Also in February 2008, she publicly appeared beside her husband during a press conference in response to a newspaper report regarding his connection to a lobbyist.179
McCain faced media scrutiny about her wealth, spending habits, and financial obligations.180181182 At first declining to release her separate income tax returns, saying it was a privacy issue and that she would not do so even if she became First Lady,183 she later released the first two pages of her 2006 return, which showed $6 million in income for that year (including nearly $570,000 in itemized deductions and more than $1.7 million paid in federal income taxes).184 The campaign said that any decisions about how to handle her role in Hensley &amp; Co. if she became First Lady would not be made until that time.185 While she stood to gain a considerable profit from the agreed-upon acquisition of Anheuser-Busch by the Belgian company InBev,186187 she was initially under some political pressure to help oppose the deal and keep Anheuser-Busch under American ownership.188
In June 2008, a Rasmussen Reports poll found that 49 percent of voters viewed Cindy McCain favorably and 29 percent unfavorably,189 while an ABC News/Washington Post poll found figures of 39 percent and 25 percent respectively.190 Her style and fashion sense was the subject of much media scrutiny.191192 McCain was compared to former first lady Nancy Reagan,193 due to both her style and wardrobe194195 as well as her demeanor.196 Early in the campaign, some recipes attributed to Cindy McCain turned out to be copied from other sources; the campaign attributed the problem to an error by an intern.197198199
Cindy McCain spoke on both the opening and final nights of the early September 2008 Republican National Convention. On the first night, truncated due to national attention regarding Hurricane Gustav, she appeared with First Lady Laura Bush to deliver short remarks encouraging support for hurricane relief efforts along the Gulf Coast,200 and on the last night, she introduced the seven McCain children and spoke about how her husband's love for his country had been passed on to them.201 In October 2008, she increased the intensity of her public remarks against Obama's candidacy.202 The stresses of the campaign caused the  McCain's weight to fall under .203 On November 4, 2008, she fought back tears in an appearance as the McCain campaign reached its final day and subsequent loss to Obama.204
Subsequent life
After the election, Cindy McCain was approached about appearing on Dancing With the Stars. She seriously considered participating, but according to John McCain, was concerned that her surgically replaced knee would not withstand the rigors of the competition.205
Continuing her humanitarian aid work with a January 2009 trip to Dubai, India, and Cambodia, she said that she was relieved that the campaign was over, and that while it had been &quot;wild and nuts&quot; at times, it had also been, &quot;a remarkable experience to be a contender for the highest office in the land.&quot;206 She said the ongoing global economic crisis was adversely affecting humanitarian organizations, and she expressed hope that President Obama would be successful in dealing with it.207
She expressed support for gay rights by appearing alongside her daughter Meghan at an April 2009 convention of the Log Cabin Republicans208 and was described by her daughter as a strong supporter of gay marriage.209
In September 2009 she spoke about her migraines for the first time publicly, and decided to speak at the International Headache Congress about raising awareness for sufferers.210
