Plot
&quot;Invasion&quot; opens to several new surgical residents from Mercy West entering Seattle Grace, a repercussion of the merger. Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) is recovering from her liver transplantation surgery, after donating a portion of it to her father. In the residents' lounge, Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) tries to explain to Mercy West resident Dr. Reed Adamson (Nora Zehetner) that she should not use a certain locker, due to it formerly belonging to the deceased Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight). Adamson ignores her wishes, and uses the locker, leading Stevens to threatening her with a fight. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) and Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) are working in the emergency room, when Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) embarrasses Yang by taking Mercy West resident Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams)' side in a disagreement. Despite her mindset that all Mercy West residents would act in the manner of Adamson, Stevens develops a friendship with Dr. Charles Percy (Robert Baker). After months of the two not speaking, Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez)'s father, Carlos (Hector Elizondo), shows up to the hospital with a priest, trying to condemn Torres for her concurrence in homosexuality. Under the supervision of Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Lexie works with Mercy West resident Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) on a burglar, and the two get in several disagreements, leading Lexie to steal her diary.
Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and Adamson continuously argue over the course of treatment for a patient, leading the patient's daughter to yell at them in disbelief. Angry about the revelation that Percy was using her, Stevens accidentally administers the wrong dialysis to a patient, making her an unviable candidate for the kidney transplant she was scheduled to receive. After arguing over surgical cases for the entirety of the day, Yang comes to the realization that she needs a cardiothoracic surgeon to work at the hospital. After being mistreated by Kepner, Lexie begins to mock her about what is written in her diary, but subsequently apologizes. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Torres' girlfriend, talks to Carlos, and convinces him to accept his daughter's sexuality. Having found out about Stevens' mistake, Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) reprimands her reports her to the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.). Webber asks Stevens to come into her office, and he fires her from the staff, noting that Hunt, Shepherd, and Karev had concerns with her coming back to work so early. Stevens departs, writing Karev a Dear John letter, and he cries to Meredith and Yang.

The Los Angeles Times{{'}} Carina MacKenzie's review of the episode was largely positive, though she called it &quot;immature&quot; of the episode's writers to have the characters in constant battle with one another, and deemed the Mercy West resident's orange scrubs unnecessary.11 MacKenzie highly praised the characterization of Kepner, in addition to Capshaw's performance, commenting: &quot;Jessica Capshaw has an incredible ability to take even the most melodramatic of Grey's [Anatomy] speeches and deliver them with a subtlety and an honesty that makes them come off as sincere instead of overwrought.&quot;12 MacKenzie concluded that Karev, Yang, and Meredith had appropriate reactions to Stevens' departure.13 Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post praised the scene in which Yang broke down to Meredith, noting the exceptional chemistry between them.14 Pascua was positive of the storyline between Torres, Carlos, and Robbins, writing that it was nice to see an emphasis on the gay storyline.15 Adam Bryant of TV Guide wrote that Baker's character &quot;seems like the only decent guy in the bunch&quot;,16 though PopSugar asserted that Williams' character &quot;proves to be most likable of the new doctors&quot;.17
