Background and release
After a high-profile title role in the musical biopic Selena (1997), Lopez began developing her own career in music, later being signed to Work Records by Tommy Mottola.12 Her debut album entitled On the 6 (1999) became an instant commercial success, and spawned the Billboard Hot 100 number one song &quot;If You Had My Love&quot;.34 This led her to begin recording new material for her second album in April 2000.5 Initially, the album was to be called A Passionate Journey.6 During this period, Lopez began to transition into a sex symbol and was nicknamed J.Lo by the public, which is known as a nickname and &quot;public persona&quot;.7 Hence, she instead released an album entitled J.Lo, which she credits as being more &quot;personal&quot; and &quot;romantic&quot; than On the 6.89 &quot;Love Don't Cost a Thing&quot;, the album's lead single, was globally premiered on November 16, 2000.10 &quot;Play&quot; was then released as the album's second official single on March 27, 2001.1112 In 2004, South Korean girl group Baby V.O.X. covered &quot;Play&quot; in Korean and English for their final album, Ride West, with participation from Lopez.13
Composition and crtical reception

&quot;Play&quot; is a dance-pop song with a length of three minutes and thirty-three seconds (3:33).14 It was written by Anders Bagge, Arnthor Birgisson, and Cory Rooney, with production from BAG &amp; Arnthor. Before she made her own debut as a recording artist, actress and singer Christina Milian also co-wrote and performed background vocals on &quot;Play&quot;.1516 Lopez recorded her vocals for the song with Robert Williams at Murlyn Studios, Stockholm as well as the Sony Music Studios in New York City. The song was later mastered by Ted Jensen.17 On the song, Lopez pleas with a nightclub DJ to &quot;play her favorite song&quot;, containing lyrics such as, &quot;Play, come on DJ/ Play that song/ Play it all night long/ Just turn it up and turn me on&quot;.18 It contains a &quot;shuffling&quot; electric guitar, as performed by Paul Pesco, over a &quot;whistling electronica dance beat&quot;. A writer from Telegram &amp; Gazette called the track &quot;Madonna-esque&quot;.19
Allmusic's MacKenzie Wilson said &quot;Play&quot; &quot;coincided with Lopez's funky style&quot;.20 Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented that &quot;so many of the tracks&quot; on the album J.Lo &quot;sound like they're straight out of 1986&quot;. He then went on to opine that &quot;I'm Real&quot; or the &quot;funky&quot; &quot;Play&quot; would have made a &quot;brave&quot; choice for the album's lead single, instead of &quot;Love Don't Cost a Thing&quot;.21 A writer from The Indianapolis Star dismissed the album and its sexual content, while also using the explicit &quot;Play&quot; as an example of it not being appropriate for Lopez's target audience, who are predominantly preteens.22 Jake Barnes of Yahoo! Music UK noted &quot;Play&quot; to resemble the music of Prince.23

Music video
 The mainly computer generated music video for &quot;Play&quot; was directed by Francis Lawrence.37 Set in a futuristic multi-level spaceship, the clip begins with Lopez strutting into the boarding area whilst the other passengers gaze at her in aw. The video then cuts to Lopez, now on the plane, relaxing with a pair of headphones on listening to music. Various shots showing the plane's exterior are inter cut with these scenes of the singer. Lopez is then seen entering a room through sliding doors with a new outfit. The doors lead to a club filled with dancers. Intercut with these scenes are Lopez dancing solo on a platform, later joined by back-up dancers. Towards the music video's conclusion, Lopez asks the DJ (who takes the avatar of an iris) to play her favorite song. Its final shot depicts the plane flying towards the horizon. The music video, much like &quot;Love Don't Cost a Thing&quot;, also features Cris Judd as a back-up dancer, who would later go on to become her second husband months later.3839
