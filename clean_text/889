 The history of Solidarity, a Polish non-governmental trade union, began in August 1980 at the Gda&lt;U+0144&gt;sk Shipyards where Lech Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa and others formed Solidarity (). In the early 1980s, it became the first independent labor union in a Soviet-bloc country. Solidarity gave rise to a broad anti-communist nonviolent social movement that, at its height, united some 10 million members and vastly contributed to the fall of communism.
Poland's communist government attempted to destroy the union by instituting martial law in 1981, followed by several years of political repression, but in the end was forced to begin negotiating with the union. The Roundtable Talks between the weakened government and the Solidarity-led opposition resulted in semi-free elections in 1989. By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed, and, in December 1990, Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa was elected president. This was soon followed by the dismantling of the communist governmental system and by Poland's transformation into a modern democratic state. Solidarity's survival meant a break in the hard-line stance of the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR), and was an unprecedented event not only for the People's Republic of Poland&lt;U+2014&gt;a satellite of the USSR ruled by a one-party communist regime&lt;U+2014&gt;but for the whole of the Eastern bloc. Solidarity's example led to the spread of anti-communist ideas and movements throughout the countries of the Eastern Bloc, weakening their communist governments; a process that eventually culminated in the Revolutions of 1989 (the &quot;Autumn of Nations&quot;).
In the 1990s, Solidarity's influence on Poland's political scene waned. A political arm of the &quot;Solidarity&quot; movement, Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS), was founded in 1996 and would win the Polish parliamentary elections in 1997, only to lose the subsequent, 2001 elections. As of 2006 the Solidarity has little political influence and is more active as a traditional trade union.
Pre&lt;U+2013&gt;1980 roots
In the 1970s and 1980s, the initial success of Solidarity in particular, and of dissident movements in general, was fed by a deepening crisis within Soviet-style societies brought about by declining morale, worsening economic conditions (a shortage economy), and the growing stresses of the Cold War.1 After a brief period of economic boom, from 1975 the policies of the Polish government, led by Party First Secretary Edward Gierek, precipitated a slide into increasing depression, as foreign debt mounted.2 In June 1976, the first workers' strikes took place, involving violent incidents at factories in Radom and Ursus.3 When these incidents were quelled by the government, the worker's movement received support from intellectual dissidents, many of them associated with the Committee for Defense of the Workers (, abbreviated KOR), formed in 1976.45 The following year, KOR was renamed the Committee for Social Self-defence (KSS-KOR).
On October 16, 1978, the Bishop of Krak&lt;U+00F3&gt;w, Karol Wojty&lt;U+0142&gt;a, was elected Pope John Paul II. A year later, during his first pilgrimage to Poland, his masses were attended by millions of his countrymen. The Pope called for the respecting of national and religious traditions and advocated for freedom and human rights, while denouncing violence. To many Poles, he represented a spiritual and moral force that could be set against brute material forces; he was a bellwether of change, and became an important symbol&lt;U+2014&gt;and supporter&lt;U+2014&gt;of changes to come.67
Early strikes (1980&lt;U+2013&gt;81)
Strikes did not occur merely due to problems that had emerged shortly before the labor unrest, but due to governmental and economic difficulties spanning more than a decade. In July 1980, Edward Gierek's government, facing economic crisis, decided to raise prices while slowing the growth of wages. At once there ensued a wave of strikes and factory occupations.8 Although the strike movement had no coordinating center, the workers had developed an information network to spread news of their struggle. A &quot;dissident&quot; group, the Committee for the Defense of the Workers (KOR), which had originally been set up in 1976 to organize aid for victimized workers, attracted small groups of working-class militants in major industrial centers.9 At the Lenin Shipyard in Gda&lt;U+0144&gt;sk, the firing of Anna Walentynowicz, a popular crane operator and activist, galvanized the outraged workers into action.1011
On August 14, the shipyard workers began their strike, organized by the Free Trade Unions of the Coast (Wolne Zwi&lt;U+0105&gt;zki Zawodowe Wybrze&lt;U+017C&gt;a).12 The workers were led by electrician Lech Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa, a former shipyard worker who had been dismissed in 1976, and who arrived at the shipyard late in the morning of August 14.13 The strike committee demanded the rehiring of Walentynowicz and Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa, as well as the according of respect to workers' rights and other social concerns. In addition, they called for the raising of a monument to the shipyard workers who had been killed in 1970 and for the legalization of independent trade unions.14
 The Polish government enforced censorship, and official media said little about the &quot;sporadic labor disturbances in Gda&lt;U+0144&gt;sk&quot;; as a further precaution, all phone connections between the coast and the rest of Poland were soon cut.15 Nonetheless, the government failed to contain the information: a spreading wave of samizdats (Polish: bibu&lt;U+0142&gt;a),16 including Robotnik (The Worker), and grapevine gossip, along with Radio Free Europe broadcasts that penetrated the Iron Curtain,17 ensured that the ideas of the emerging Solidarity movement quickly spread.
On August 16, delegations from other strike committees arrived at the shipyard.18 Delegates (Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (Mi&lt;U+0119&gt;dzyzak&lt;U+0142&gt;adowy Komitet Strajkowy, or MKS).19 On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on to call for a relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.20
 Next day, a delegation of KOR intelligentsia, including Tadeusz Mazowiecki, arrived to offer their assistance with negotiations. A bibu&lt;U+0142&gt;a news-sheet, Solidarno&lt;U+015B&gt;&lt;U+0107&gt;, produced on the shipyard&lt;U+2019&gt;s printing press with KOR assistance, reached a daily print run of 30,000 copies.21 Meanwhile, Jacek Kaczmarski's protest song, Mury (Walls), gained popularity with the workers.22
On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard joined the strike, under the leadership of Marian Jurczyk. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee.2324 By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area. More and more new unions were formed, and joined the federation.  Thanks to popular support within Poland, as well as to international support and media coverage, the Gda&lt;U+0144&gt;sk workers held out until the government gave in to their demands. On August 21 a Governmental Commission (Komisja Rz&lt;U+0105&gt;dowa) including Mieczys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Jagielski arrived in Gda&lt;U+0144&gt;sk, and another one with Kazimierz Barcikowski was dispatched to Szczecin. On August 30 and 31, and on September 3, representatives of the workers and the government signed an agreement ratifying many of the workers' demands, including the right to strike.25 This agreement came to be known as the August or Gda&lt;U+0144&gt;sk agreement (Porozumienia sierpniowe).26 Though concerned with labor-union matters, the agreement enabled citizens to introduce democratic changes within the communist political structure and was regarded as a first step toward dismantling the Party's monopoly of power.27 The workers' main concerns were the establishment of a labor union independent of communist-party control, and recognition of a legal right to strike. Workers&lt;U+2019&gt; needs would now receive clear representation.28 Another consequence of the Gda&lt;U+0144&gt;sk Agreement was the replacement, in September 1980, of Edward Gierek by Stanis&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Kania as Party First Secretary.29
 Encouraged by the success of the August strikes, on September 17 workers' representatives, including Lech Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa, formed a nationwide labor union, Solidarity (Niezale&lt;U+017C&gt;ny Samorz&lt;U+0105&gt;dny Zwi&lt;U+0105&gt;zek Zawodowy (NSZZ) &quot;Solidarno&lt;U+015B&gt;&lt;U+0107&gt;&quot;).303132 It was the first independent labor union in a Soviet-bloc country.33 Its name was suggested by Karol Modzelewski, and its famous logo was conceived by Jerzy Janiszewski, designer of many Solidarity-related posters. The new union's supreme powers were vested in a legislative body, the Convention of Delegates (Zjazd Delegat&lt;U+00F3&gt;w). The executive branch was the National Coordinating Commission (Krajowa Komisja Porozumiewawcza), later renamed the National Commission (Komisja Krajowa). The Union had a regional structure, comprising 38 regions (region) and two districts (okr&lt;U+0119&gt;g).34 On December 16, 1980, the Monument to Fallen Shipyard Workers was unveiled. On January 15, 1981, a Solidarity delegation, including Lech Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa, met in Rome with Pope John Paul II. From September 5 to 10, and from September 26 to October 7, Solidarity's first national congress was held, and Lech Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa was elected its president.35
 Meanwhile Solidarity had been transforming itself from a trade union into a social movement36 or more specifically, a revolutionary movement.37 Over the 500 days following the Gda&lt;U+0144&gt;sk Agreement, 9-10 million workers, intellectuals and students joined it or its suborganizations,38 such as the Independent Student Union (Niezale&lt;U+017C&gt;ne Zrzeszenie Student&lt;U+00F3&gt;w, created in September 1980), the Independent Farmers' Trade Union (NSZZ Rolnik&lt;U+00F3&gt;w Indywidualnych &quot;Solidarno&lt;U+015B&gt;&lt;U+0107&gt;&quot;, created in May 1981) and the Independent Craftsmen's Trade Union.39 It was the only time in recorded history that a quarter of a country's population (some 80% of the total Polish work force) had voluntarily joined a single organization.4041 &quot;History has taught us that there is no bread without freedom,&quot; the Solidarity program stated a year later. &quot;What we had in mind was not only bread, butter and sausages, but also justice, democracy, truth, legality, human dignity, freedom of convictions, and the repair of the republic.&quot;42
 Using strikes and other protest actions, Solidarity sought to force a change in government policies. At the same time, it was careful never to use force or violence, so as to avoid giving the government any excuse to bring security forces into play.4344 After 27 Bydgoszcz Solidarity members, including Jan Rulewski, were beaten up on March 19, a 4-hour strike on March 27, involving over half a million people, paralyzed the country.45 This was the largest strike in the history of the Eastern bloc,46 and it forced the government to promise an investigation into the beatings.47 This concession, and Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa's agreement to defer further strikes, proved a setback to the movement, as the euphoria that had swept Polish society subsided.48 Nonetheless the Polish communist party&lt;U+2014&gt;the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR)&lt;U+2014&gt;had lost its total control over society.49
Yet while Solidarity was ready to take up negotiations with the government,50 the Polish communists were unsure what to do, as they issued empty declarations and bid their time.51 Against the background of a deteriorating communist shortage economy and unwillingness to negotiate seriously with Solidarity, it became increasingly clear that the Communist government would eventually have to suppress the Solidarity movement as the only way out of the impasse, or face a truly revolutionary situation. The atmosphere was increasingly tense, with various local chapters conducting a growing number of uncoordinated strikes in response to the worsening economic situation.52On December 3 Solidarity announced that a 24-hour strike would be held if the government were granted additional powers to suppress dissent, and that a general strike would be declared if those powers were used.
Martial law (1981&lt;U+2013&gt;83)

 After the Gda&lt;U+0144&gt;sk Agreement, the Polish government was under increasing pressure from the Soviet Union to take action and strengthen its position. Stanis&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Kania was viewed by Moscow as too independent, and on October 18, 1981, the Party Central Committee put him in the minority. Kania lost his post as First Secretary, and was replaced by Prime Minister (and Minister of Defence) Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who adopted a strong-arm policy.53
On December 13, 1981, Jaruzelski began a crack-down on Solidarity, declaring martial law and creating a Military Council of National Salvation (Wojskowa Rada Ocalenia Narodowego, or WRON). Solidarity's leaders, gathered at Gda&lt;U+0144&gt;sk, were arrested and isolated in facilities guarded by the Security Service (S&lt;U+0142&gt;u&lt;U+017C&gt;ba Bezpiecze&lt;U+0144&gt;stwa or SB), and some 5,000 Solidarity supporters were arrested in the middle of the night.5455 Censorship was expanded, and military forces appeared on the streets.56 A couple of hundred strikes and occupations occurred, chiefly at the largest plants and at several Silesian coal mines, but were broken by ZOMO paramilitary riot police. One of the largest demonstrations, on December 16, 1981, took place at the Wujek Coal Mine, where government forces opened fire on demonstrators, killing 957 and seriously injuring 22.58  Next day, during protests at Gda&lt;U+0144&gt;sk, government forces again fired at demonstrators, killing 1 and injuring 2. By December 28, 1981, strikes had ceased, and Solidarity appeared crippled. On October 8, 1982, the organization was delegalized and banned.59
The international community outside the Iron Curtain condemned Jaruzelski's actions and declared support for Solidarity.60 US President Ronald Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland, which eventually would force the Polish government into liberalizing its policies.61 Meanwhile the CIA62 together with the Catholic Church and various Western trade unions such as the AFL-CIO provided funds, equipment and advice to the Solidarity underground.63 The political alliance of Reagan and the Pope would prove important to the future of Solidarity.64 The Polish public also supported what was left of Solidarity; a major medium for demonstrating support of Solidarity became masses held by priests such as Jerzy Popie&lt;U+0142&gt;uszko.65
In July 1983, martial Law was formally lifted, though many heightened controls on civil liberties and political life, as well as food rationing, remained in place through the mid- to late 1980s.66
Solidarity underground (1982&lt;U+2013&gt;88)
 Almost immediately after the legal Solidarity leadership had been arrested, underground structures began to arise.67 On April 12, 1982, Radio Solidarity began broadcasting.68 On April 22, Zbigniew Bujak, Bogdan Lis, W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Frasyniuk and W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Hardek created an Interim Coordinating Commission (Tymczasowa Komisja Koordynacyjna) to serve as an underground leadership for Solidarity.69 On May 6 another underground Solidarity organization, an NSSZ &quot;S&quot; Regional Coordinating Commission (Regionalna Komisja Koordynacyjna NSZZ &quot;S&quot;), was created by Bogdan Borusewicz, Aleksander Hall, Stanis&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Jarosz, Bogdan Lis and Marian &lt;U+015A&gt;witek.70 June 1982 saw the creation of a Fighting Solidarity (Solidarno&lt;U+015B&gt;&lt;U+0107&gt; Walcz&lt;U+0105&gt;ca) organization.7172
Throughout the mid-1980s, Solidarity persevered as an exclusively underground organization.73 Its activists were dogged by the Security Service (SB), but managed to strike back: on May 1, 1982, a series of anti-government protests brought out thousands of participants&lt;U+2014&gt;several dozen thousand in Gda&lt;U+0144&gt;sk.74 On May 3 more protests took place, during celebrations of the Constitution of May 3, 1791. Further strikes occurred at Gda&lt;U+0144&gt;sk between October 11 and 13.75
On November 14, 1982, Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa was released.76 However on December 9 the SB carried out a large anti-Solidarity operation, arresting over 10,000 activists. On December 27 Solidarity's assets were transferred by the authorities to a pro-government trade union, the All-Polish Conference of Trade Unions (Og&lt;U+00F3&gt;lnopolskie Porozumienie Zwi&lt;U+0105&gt;zk&lt;U+00F3&gt;w Zawodowych, or OPZZ). Yet Solidarity was far from broken: by early 1983 the underground had over 70,000 members, whose activities included publishing over 500 underground newspapers.77
On July 22, 1983, the martial law was lifted, and amnesty was granted to many imprisoned Solidarity members, who were released.78 On October 5, Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize.79 The Polish government, however, refused to issue him a passport to travel to Stockholm; Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa's prize was accepted on his behalf by his wife.80 It later transpired that the SB had prepared bogus documents, accusing Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa of immoral and illegal activities that had been given to the Nobel committee in an attempt to derail his nomination.81
 On October 19, 1984, three agents of the Ministry of Internal Security murdered a popular pro-Solidarity priest, Jerzy Popie&lt;U+0142&gt;uszko.82 As the facts emerged, thousands of people declared their solidarity with the murdered priest by attending his funeral, held on November 3, 1984. The government attempted to smooth over the situation by releasing thousands of political prisoners;83 a year later, however, there followed a new wave of arrests.84 Frasyniuk, Lis and Adam Michnik, members of the &quot;S&quot; underground, were arrested on February 13, 1985, placed on a show trial, and sentenced to several years' imprisonment.8586
On March 11, 1985, power in the Soviet Union was assumed by Mikhail Gorbachev, a leader who represented a new generation of Soviet party members. The worsening economic situation in the entire Eastern Bloc, including the Soviet Union, together with other factors, forced Gorbachev to carry out a number of reforms, not only in the field of economics (uskoreniye) but in the political and social realms (glasnost and perestroika).87 Gorbachev's policies soon caused a corresponding shift in the policies of Soviet satellites, including the People's Republic of Poland.88 On September 11, 1986, 225 Polish political prisoners were released&lt;U+2014&gt;the last of those connected with Solidarity, and arrested during the previous years.89
On September 30, Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa created the first public, legal Solidarity entity since the declaration of martial law&lt;U+2014&gt;the Temporary Council of NSZZ Solidarno&lt;U+015B&gt;&lt;U+0107&gt; (Tymczasowa Rada NSZZ Solidarno&lt;U+015B&gt;&lt;U+0107&gt;)&lt;U+2014&gt;with Bogdan Borusewicz, Zbigniew Bujak, W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Frasyniuk, Tadeusz Jedynak, Bogdan Lis, Janusz Pa&lt;U+0142&gt;ubicki and J&lt;U+00F3&gt;zef Pinior. Soon afterwards, the new Council was admitted to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.90 Many local Solidarity chapters now broke their cover throughout Poland, and on October 25, 1987, the National Executive Committee (Solidarity)|National Executive Committee of NSZZ Solidarno&lt;U+015B&gt;&lt;U+0107&gt; (Krajowa Komisja Wykonawcza NSZZ Solidarno&lt;U+015B&gt;&lt;U+0107&gt;) was created. Nonetheless, Solidarity members and activists continued to be persecuted and discriminated, if less so than during the early 1980s.91 In the late 1980s, a rift between Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa's faction and a more radical Fighting Solidarity grew as the former wanted to negotiate with the government, while the latter planned for an anti-communist revolution.929394
Twilight of the Party (1988&lt;U+2013&gt;89)

&quot;High Noon, 4 June 1989.&quot;
Solidarity Citizens' Committee election poster by Tomasz Sarnecki.

By 1988, Poland's economy was in worse condition than it had been eight years earlier. International sanctions, combined with the government's unwillingness to introduce reforms, intensified the old problems.9596 Inefficient government-run planned-economy enterprises wasted labor and resources, producing substandard goods for which there was little demand. Polish exports were low, both because of the sanctions and because the goods were as unattractive abroad as they were at home. Foreign debt and inflation mounted. There were no funds to modernize factories, and the promised &quot;market socialism&quot; materialized as a shortage economy characterized by long queues and empty shelves.97 Reforms introduced by Jaruzelski and Mieczys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Rakowski came too little and too late, especially as changes in the Soviet Union had bolstered the public's expectation that change must come, and the Soviets ceased their efforts to prop up Poland's failing regime.9899
In February 1988, the government hiked food prices by 40%.100 On April 21, a new wave of strikes hit the country.101 On May 2, workers at the Gda&lt;U+0144&gt;sk Shipyard went on strike.102 That strike was broken by the government between May 5 and May 10, but only temporarily: on August 15, a new strike took place at the &quot;July Manifesto&quot; mine in Jastrz&lt;U+0119&gt;bie Zdr&lt;U+00F3&gt;j.103 By August 20 the strike had spread to many other mines, and on August 22 the Gda&lt;U+0144&gt;sk Shipyard joined the strike.104 Poland's communist government then decided to negotiate.105106
On August 26, Czes&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Kiszczak, the Minister of Internal Affairs, declared on television that the government was willing to negotiate, and five days later he met with Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa. The strikes ended the following day, and on October 30, during a televised debate between Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa and Alfred Miodowicz (leader of the pro-government trade union, the All-Polish Conference of Trade Unions), Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa scored a public-relations victory.107
On December 18, a hundred-member Citizens' Committee (Komitet Obywatelski) was formed within Solidarity. It comprised several sections, each responsible for presenting a specific aspect of opposition demands to the government. Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa and the majority of Solidarity leaders supported negotiation, while a minority wanted an anticommunist revolution. Under Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa's leadership, Solidarity decided to pursue a peaceful solution, and the pro-violence faction never attained any substantial power, nor did it take any action.108109
 On January 27, 1989, in a meeting between Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa and Kiszczak, a list was drawn up of members of the main negotiating teams. The conference that began on February 6 would be known as the Polish Round Table Talks.110 The 56 participants included 20 from &quot;S,&quot; 6 from OPZZ, 14 from the PZPR, 14 &quot;independent authorities,&quot; and two priests. The Polish Round Table Talks took place in Warsaw from February 6 to April 4, 1989. The Communists, led by Gen. Jaruzelski, hoped to co-opt prominent opposition leaders into the ruling group without making major changes in the structure of political power. Solidarity, while hopeful, did not anticipate major changes. In fact, the talks would radically alter the shape of the Polish government and society.111112
On April 17, 1989, Solidarity was legalized, and its membership soon reached 1.5 million.113114 The Solidarity Citizens' Committee (Komitet Obywatelski &quot;Solidarno&lt;U+015B&gt;&lt;U+0107&gt;&quot;) was given permission to field candidates in the upcoming elections. Election law allowed Solidarity to put forward candidates for only 35% of the seats in the Sejm, but there were no restrictions in regard to Senat candidates.115 Agitation and propaganda continued legally up to election day. Despite its shortage of resources, Solidarity managed to carry on an electoral campaign.116117 On May 8, the first issue of a new pro-Solidarity newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza (The Election Gazette), was published.118 Posters of Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa supporting various candidates, appeared throughout the country.
 Pre-election public-opinion polls had promised victory to the communists.119 Thus the total defeat of the PZPR and its satellite parties came as a surprise to all involved: after the first round of elections, it became evident that Solidarity had fared extremely well,120 capturing 160 of 161 contested Sejm seats, and 92 of 100 Senate seats. After the second round, it had won virtually every seat&lt;U+2014&gt;all 161 in the Sejm, and 99 in the Senate.121 The new Contract Sejm, named for the agreement that had been reached by the communist party and the Solidarity movement during the Polish Round Table Talks, would be dominated by Solidarity. As agreed beforehand, Wojciech Jaruzelski was elected president.122123 However, the communist candidate for Prime Minister, Czes&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Kiszczak, who replaced Mieczys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Rakowski,124 failed to gain enough support to form a government.125126
On June 23, a Solidarity Citizens' Parliamentary Club (Obywatelski Klub Parlamentarny &quot;Solidarno&lt;U+015B&gt;&lt;U+0107&gt;&quot;) was formed, led by Bronis&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Geremek.127 It formed a coalition with two ex-satellite parties of the PZPR&lt;U+2014&gt;ZSL and SD&lt;U+2014&gt;which had now chosen to &quot;rebel&quot; against the PZPR, which found itself in the minority.128 On August 24, the Sejm elected Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a Solidarity representative, to be Prime Minister of Poland.129130131 Not only was he a first non-communist Polish Prime Minister since 1945, he became the first non-Communist prime minister in Eastern Europe since nearly 40 years.132 In his speech he talked about the &quot;thick line&quot; (Gruba kreska) which would separate his government from the communist past133 By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed.
Bitter success (1989 to the present)
 The fall of the communist regime marked a new chapter in the history of Poland and in the history of Solidarity. Having defeated the communist government, Solidarity found itself in a role it was much less prepared for &lt;U+2014&gt; that of a political party &lt;U+2014&gt; and soon began to lose popularity.134135 Conflicts among Solidarity factions intensified.136137 Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa was elected Solidarity chairman, but support for him could be seen to be crumbling. One of his main opponents, W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Frasyniuk, withdrew from elections altogether. In September 1990, Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa declared that Gazeta Wyborcza had no right to use the Solidarity logo.
Later that month, Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa announced his intent to run for president of Poland. In December 1990, he was elected president.138 He resigned his Solidarity post and became the first president of Poland ever to be elected by popular vote.
These elections, in which anti-communist candidates won a striking victory, inaugurated a series of peaceful anti-communist revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe139140141 that eventually culminated in the fall of communism.142143
 Next year, in February 1991, Marian Krzaklewski was elected the leader of Solidarity.144 President Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa's vision and that of the new Solidarity leadership were diverging. Far from supporting Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa, Solidarity was becoming increasingly critical of the government, and decided to create its own political party for action in the upcoming 1991 parliamentary elections.145
The 1991 elections were characterized by a large number of competing parties, many claiming the legacy of anti-communism, and the Solidarity party garnered only 5% of the votes.
On January 13, 1992, Solidarity declared its first strike against the democratically elected government: a one-hour strike against a proposal to raise energy prices. Another, two-hour strike took place on December 14. On May 19, 1993, Solidarity deputies proposed a no-confidence motion&lt;U+2014&gt;which passed&lt;U+2014&gt;against the government of Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka.146 President Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa declined to accept the prime minister's resignation, and dismissed the parliament.

Marian Krzaklewski, a late-1990s leader of Solidarity Electoral Action.

It was in the ensuing 1993 parliamentary elections that it became evident how much Solidarity's support had eroded in the previous three years. Even though some Solidarity deputies sought to assume a more left-wing stance and to distance themselves from the right-wing government, Solidarity remained identified in the public mind with that government. Hence it suffered from the growing disillusionment of the populace, as the transition from a communist to a capitalist system failed to generate instant wealth and raise Poland's living standards to those in the West, and the government's financial &quot;shock therapy&quot; (the Balcerowicz Plan) generated much opposition.147148
In the elections, Solidarity received only 4.9% of the votes, 0.1% less than the 5% required in order to enter parliament (Solidarity still had 9 senators, 2 fewer then in the previous Senate). The victorious party was the Democratic Left Alliance (Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej or SLD), a post-communist left-wing party.149
Solidarity now joined forces with its erstwhile enemy, the All-Polish Conference of Trade Unions (OPZZ), and some protests were organized by both trade unions.150 The following year, Solidarity organized many strikes over the state of the Polish mining industry. In 1995, a demonstration before the Polish parliament was broken up by the police (now again known as policja) using batons and water guns. Nonetheless, Solidarity decided to support Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa in the 1995 presidential elections.
In a second major defeat for the Polish right wing, the elections were won by an SLD candidate, Aleksander Kwa&lt;U+015B&gt;niewski, who received 51.72% of votes. A Solidarity call for new elections went unheeded, but the Sejm still managed to pass a resolution condemning the 1981 martial law (despite the SLD voting against). Meanwhile the left-wing OPZZ trade union had acquired 2.5 millions members, twice as many as the contemporary Solidarity (with 1.3 millions).151

Jerzy Buzek of Solidarity Electoral Action, late-1990s prime minister.

In June 1996, Solidarity Electoral Action (Akcja Wyborcza Solidarno&lt;U+015B&gt;&lt;U+0107&gt;) was founded as a coalition of over 30 right-wing parties, uniting liberal, conservative and Christian-democratic forces. As the public became disillusioned with the SLD and its allies, AWS was victorious in the 1997 parliamentary elections.152 Jerzy Buzek became the new prime minister.
However, controversies over domestic reforms, Poland's 1999 entry into NATO, and the accession process to the European Union, combined with AWS' fights with its political allies (the Freedom Union&lt;U+2014&gt;Unia Wolno&lt;U+015B&gt;ci) and infighting within AWS itself, as well as corruption (reflected in the infamous &quot;TKM&quot; slogan), eventually resulted in the loss of much public support.153 AWS leader Marian Krzaklewski lost the 2000 presidential election, and in the 2001 parliamentary elections AWS failed to elect a single deputy to the parliament.154 After this debacle, the union decided to distance itself from politics.155
As of 2006, Solidarity has some 1.5 million members, but little political clout. Its mission statement declares that Solidarity, &quot;basing its activities on Christian ethics and Catholic social teachings, works to protect workers' interests and to fulfill their material, social and cultural aspirations.&quot;156
