Plot
The film is a mockumentary which examines the possibility that Adolf Hitler did not die at the end of World War II in 1945. It centers around historian Skule Antonsen of Norway (Jon Rekdal) who along with film director Idelfonso Elizalde of Spain (Juli&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Elizalde) together investigate Adolf Munchenhauser (Dick Nilsson). Munchenhauser is an individual who bears a striking resemblance to Hitler, and he was taken captive in Berlin, Germany in 1945 by the Allies of World War II. He was one of 13 men transported on board a United States Air Force cargo plane who all happen to appear similar in appearance to Hitler.
After gaining freedom in 1946 from captivity in a facility called Camp Rebecca located in the Great Basin Desert, Munchenhauser chooses to remain in the United States. Skule researches evidence surrounding Munchenhauser's activities in an effort to authenticate whether or not he is indeed Hitler. During the course of his investigation, Skule's research efforts are stymied by unknown individuals.

Reception
The film received a positive review from Fangoria, &quot;Going into One Hundred Years of Evil expecting a deadpan, seriously played piece of alternate history is a mistake, because Erik Eger and Magnus Oliv&lt;U+2019&gt;s movie is as comedic as faux journalism can get. Made for next-to-no money, it accumulates goofy jokes and clever twists of historical revisionism, while succeeding in its concept with a sheer dose of inventiveness and enthusiasm.&quot;3 The review praised the performance of Jon Rekdal as Skule Antonsen.4 Ecrans noted, &quot;There's much fun.&quot;5 The film received one and a half stars out of five in a critical review from Luuk Imhann in 'Cinemagazine'', who compared it to the film Zelig by Woody Allen.6 Ain't It Cool News gave the film a positive review, &quot;Part comedy, part absurdist faux-history lesson, Skule&lt;U+2019&gt;s quest to find the truth is fascinating from beginning to end. Sometimes I was wondering if I was watching an actual documentary, which I think, is the ultimate compliment for directors Erik Eger &amp; Magnus Oliv. If you&lt;U+2019&gt;re looking for a twisted take on alternative history, One Hundred Years of Evil is a sure thing.&quot;7
Associate Editor of Flixlist Alec Kubas-Meyer observed, &quot;Unfortunately, One Hundred Years of Evil suffers from a pretty major identity crisis. It doesn't know whether it wants to be a mockumentary or a found footage film.&quot;8 Writing for Man, I Love Films, Thaddeus Zwolfe commented, &quot;Erik Eger and Magnus Oliv direct a movie that plays its premise and thesis beautifully. This picture does a great job of looking like the narrative moments were shot by a grad-level cameraman; beautiful scenes combine with excellent composition (the sunset shot is especially pretty), and the camera itself is a character with its own personality. The directors co-wrote with Joacim Starander and Olly Blackburn, and they conceived a smart picture.&quot;9 Serena Donadoni gave the film a grade of &quot;B&quot; in a review for IndieWire, writing, &quot;Blurring the demarcations of reality and fiction, 'One Hundred Years of Evil' transforms established history into subjective truthiness.&quot;10
Liz Ferguson of Montreal Gazette called the film a &quot;skilful mockumentary&quot;, and went on to note, &quot;Directors Erik Eger and Magnus Oliv have a field day here. They riff on conspiracy theories, cover-ups, things that are supposedly proven by computer analysis, the lone obsessive who clearly sees what others refuse to admit, people who enjoy sharing anecdotes from their past, anecdotes they&lt;U+2019&gt;ve probably told many many times by now, filmmakers who make themselves part of the story, etc., etc.&quot;11 A review by Justine Smith of Sound on Sight was negative, specifically criticizing the choice of film as a medium to tell the story, &quot;As many mockumentaries do, this film suffers due to it&lt;U+2019&gt;s length and adhering far too closely to the model it is mocking. The flaw lies largely in the exploitative model itself, whose redundant and circular form favours the channel hopping home audience. The film might have actually succeeded better as a television series.&quot;12
