The Blohm & Voss P.194 was a design for a mixed-power ground-attack aircraft and tactical bomber developed in Germany during World War II.cite book  last=Nowarra  first=Heinz J.  title=Die Deutsche Luftruestung 1933-1945 Vol.3 - Flugzeugtypen Henschel-Messerschmitt  year=1993  publisher=Bernard & Graefe Verlag  location=Koblenz  isbn=3-7637-5467-9 Like some of Richard Vogt aircraft designer Richard Vogt's other designs for Blohm & Voss, the P.194 featured an asymmetric layout. 

Along with the Blohm & Voss P.192 P.192, Blohm & Voss P.193 P.193, and Blohm & Voss P.196 P.196, the P.194 was one of four designs Blohm & Voss submitted in response to a requirement issued by the Reich Air Ministry RLM in February 1944 for a replacement for the venerable Junkers Ju 87.Myhra 1998, 67 The basic design of the aircraft echoed that of the Blohm & Voss BV 141 BV 141: the crew and weapons carried in a nacelle separate from the main fuselage structure that carried a propeller aircraft propeller-driven engine at one end and the empennage at the other, joined together by a common wing. In the P.194, however, a turbojet was to be added at the rear of the cockpit pod and the design intended that the thrust from this engine would help balance the thrust from the propeller. A powerful cluster of guns was to be located in the nose, and a bombload of up to 500&nbsp;kg 1,100&nbsp;lb was to be carried in an internal bomb bay in the fuselage.Myhra 1998, 68
 
All four Blohm & Voss designs were rejected by the RLM, which instead selected the Messerschmitt Me 262 to fill the tactical bomber role.Myhra 1998, 67 



Design stages
;P.194.00-101:version with 16&nbsp;m 52&nbsp;ft wingspan and jet intake under cockpit pod
;P.194.01-02:version with 15.3&nbsp;m 50.2&nbsp;ft wingspan, bubble canopy and jet intake under cockpit pod 
;P.194.02-01:as above, but with turbojet located beneath cockpit
;P.194.03-01:as P.194.01-02, but with jet intakes located in the wing roots at the sides of the cockpit pod.
