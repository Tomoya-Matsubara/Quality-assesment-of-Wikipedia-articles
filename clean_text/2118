WASN (1500 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a news/talk format. Licensed to Youngstown, Ohio, USA, the station serves the Youngstown-Warren area. The station is currently owned by Bernard Ohio LLC.1
Since January 1, 2010, WASN has carried an urban-focused talk format. In addition to Syndication One hosts Warren Ballentine, Rev. Al Sharpton and Michael Baisden, WASN carries a local morning show, &quot;Morning Coffee with Tracey and Friends.&quot; Previous formats have included gospel music and Spanish-language programming. The station now streams on a 24-hour basis, owing to WASN's daytime-only status (to protect WFED in Washington, D.C.).
WASN's sister station, WGFT-AM 1330, carries a conservative talk radio format.
