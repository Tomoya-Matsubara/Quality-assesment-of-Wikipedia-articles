The &quot;black flag of jihad&quot; as used by jihadist militants since ca. the late 1990s.

Jihadism (also jihadist movement or jihadi movement) is a controversial term to describe the renewed focus on armed jihad in Islamic fundamentalism.
Jihadism emerged in the 1960s, with roots in the late 19th and early 20th century ideological developments of Islamic revivalism, developed into Qutbism and related ideologies during the mid 20th century. The rise of jihadism was re-enforced by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, and has been propagated in various armed conflicts throughout the 1990s and 2000s. A specifically Salafist jihadism has been diagnosed within the modern Salafi movement by Gilles Kepel in the mid-1990s.
&quot;Jihadism&quot; in this sense covers both Mujahideen guerilla warfare and Islamic terrorism with an international scope as it arose from the 1980s, since the 1990s substantially represented by the al-Qaeda network. Jihadism with an international, Pan-Islamist scope in this sense is also known as Global Jihadism. Generally the term jihadism denotes Sunni Islamist armed struggle. Shiite and Sunni mutual sectarian tensions led to numerous forms of Sunni (Salafist and other Islamist) jihadism against Shia Muslims and Shia mosques.
Terminology

Although the adjective jihadist can be traced to the 1960s, and the abstract jihadism to ca. 1980, these terms did not see frequent use in popular media until after the 9/11 attacks of 2001. The equivalent terms of &quot;jihadist movement&quot; and &quot;jihadi movement&quot; date to the same period, entering use during the 1970s. The term &quot;jihadism&quot; translates or parallels Arabic jih&lt;U+0101&gt;diyya . The alternative form jihadi for jihadist in English usage is a transliteration of the corresponding Arabic adjective jih&lt;U+0101&gt;d&lt;U+012B&gt; .
According to Martin Kramer the term jihadism first became common in &quot;the Indian and Pakistani media&quot;. &quot;At present, jihadism is used to refer to the most violent persons and movements in contemporary Islam, including al-Qaeda.&quot; The term jihadism may also have been influenced by the term &quot;jihadist-Salafism&quot;, put into &quot;academic circulation&quot; by &quot;French academics&quot;.1
The term &quot;Jihadist Globalism&quot; is also often used in relation to Jihadism. Jihadist Globalism is said to be a response to the western modes of modernization that are believed to have worsened poverty, political instability and secular tendencies in the Muslim society. Jihadist globalism is not only a response to market globalism but also a rebuttal for domestic groups who have imposed their views on the Muslim people. Many people refer to acts of terrorism including September 11th and the 2005 London Bombings as a demonstration of jihadist globalism. However, according to Professor Manfred Steger of RMIT University, the term &quot;Jihadist Globalism&quot; can apply to all extremely violent strains of religiously influenced ideologies that articulate the global imaginary into concrete political agendas and terrorist strategies. The term does not have to be specific to the muslim society. Thus, the label could also apply to violent Christians in the West that strive to make a Christian Empire. 2
Jihad fi sabilillah
 In Islam, the phrase al-jihad fi sabilillah is the equivalent of the western notion of bellum justum or just war.3 Such a &quot;just war&quot; or &quot;war in the cause of Allah&quot; has been propagated in modern fundamentalism beginning in the late 19th century, an ideology that arose in context of struggles against colonial powers in North Africa in the late 19th century, as in the Mahdist War in Sudan, and notably in the mid-20th century by Islamic revivalist authors such as Sayyid Qutb and Abul Ala Maududi.4
Based on this, the phrase is used in modern jihadism. Thus, &quot;Fi Sabilillah&quot; armbands were worn by rebels in Xinjiang when battling Soviet forces,5 and the phrase has been spotted on flags used by jihadists in Caucasia in the 2000s.
History
  When jihadism is specifically motivated by Pan-Islamism, i.e. the ultimate aim of spreading Islam worldwide under a restored Caliphate, it is often called &quot;Global Jihadism&quot;. But jihadism can also be motivated regionally, in an attempt to establish an Islamic state in a specific homeland. Global Jihadism is usually involved with international Islamic terrorism, while regional jihadism takes the form of guerrilla warfare, possibly also paired with terrorist attacks. Historical and ongoing jihadist armed conflicts include:
