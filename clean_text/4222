Vitalian (, ) was an East Roman (Byzantine) general. Rebelling in 513 against Emperor Anastasius I, he won over large parts of the army and people of Thrace. Successive rapprochements with Anastasius failed, and the revolt continued until it was finally defeated in 515. Vitalian then went into hiding until Anastasius' death. Being a staunch Chalcedonian, he was pardoned by the new emperor Justin I and was engaged in the negotiations with the Pope to end the Acacian Schism. He was named consul for the year 520, shortly before he was murdered, probably on the orders of the emperor's nephew, Justinian.
Origins and family
He was born in Zalbada in Lower Moesia (usually identified with modern Abrit in northeastern Bulgaria).1 He is called a &quot;Goth&quot; or a &quot;Scythian&quot; (i.e. a Hun) in the sources. His mother, however, was a sister of Macedonius II, Patriarch of Constantinople in 496&lt;U+2013&gt;511, pointing to a mixed marriage and a barbarian origin for his father Patriciolus.23 Vitalian himself was the father of the generals Bouzes, Coutzes and Venilus, and uncle of John, another distinguished general.4 According to the chroniclers' descriptions, Vitalian was short of stature and stammered, but his personal bravery and military skills were widely acknowledged.56
Revolt against Anastasius
 The first mention of Vitalian is for the year 503, when he accompanied his father in the war against the Persians.7 By 513, he had risen to the rank of comes in Thrace, possibly comes foederatorum,&quot;count of the foederati&quot;, barbarian soldiers serving in the East Roman army.8
From this post, he rebelled against Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491&lt;U+2013&gt;518), taking advantage of widespread resentment over the emperor's military, religious and social policies.9 In 511, Anastasius had changed the form of the Trisagion and officially adopted the Miaphysite dogma, angering the Empire's Chalcedonian population, already alienated by his strict financial policies.10 Furthermore, Anastasius had refused to supply the annonae (&quot;rations, provisions&quot;) due to the foederati, allowing Vitalian to quickly gain the allegiance of the regular troops stationed in the provinces of Thrace, Moesia II and Scythia Minor from the unpopular magister militum per Thracias, Hypatius. Hypatius' subordinate commanders were either killed or joined the rebellion.11 At the same time, posing as a champion of Chalcedonian orthodoxy, Vitalian was able to gain the support of the local people, who flocked to join his force. According to the contemporary chroniclers, he quickly assembled an army of 50&lt;U+2013&gt;60,000 men, &quot;both soldiers and peasants&quot;, and marched onto Constantinople, possibly hoping that the mostly Chalcedonian inhabitants would join him.121314 Indeed it appears that Vitalian's revolt was primarily motivated by religious reasons, something suggested by his repeatedly demonstrated willingness to reach an accommodation with Anastasius.15 To counter Vitalian's propaganda, Anastasius ordered bronze crosses to be set up on the city walls inscribed with his own version of events. The emperor also reduced taxes in the provinces of Bithynia and Asia to prevent them from joining the rebellion.16
When Vitalian's forces reached the capital, they encamped at the suburb of Hebdomon and blockaded the landward side of the city. Anastasius opted for negotiations, and sent out Vitalian's former patron, the former consul and magister militum praesentalis Flavius Patricius, as ambassador.1718 To him, Vitalian declared his aims: the restoration of Chalcedonian orthodoxy and the settling of the Thracian army's grievances. Patricius then invited him and his officers for negotiations in the city itself. Vitalian refused for himself, but allowed his senior officers to go on the next day.1920 The officers were well treated by Anastasius, who gave them gifts and promised that their soldiers' grievances would be settled. He also pledged to submit the religious dispute for resolution to the Patriarch of Rome. Upon their return to the rebel camp, these officers unanimously pressured Vitalian to accept this settlement. Faced with no alternative, only eight days after his arrival before the capital, Vitalian retreated and returned with his men to Lower Moesia.2122
 Anastasius then appointed as magister militum per Thracias an officer called Cyril, who proceeded to attack Vitalian's forces. After a few inconclusive skirmishes, Vitalian managed to bribe his entry into Odessus, Cyril's base, and killed him.23 At this point Anastasius had Vitalian declared as a &quot;public enemy&quot; and sent out a new huge army &lt;U+2013&gt; reportedly 80,000 men &lt;U+2013&gt; under his nephew Hypatius, with a Hun called Alathar as the new magister militum of Thrace. After winning a minor initial victory, the imperial army was eventually pushed back towards Odessus (autumn 513). At Acris, on the Black Sea coast, Vitalian's men attacked their fortified laager in darkness and dealt them a crushing defeat: the larger part of the imperial army was killed, and both imperial commanders were taken prisoner and held for ransom.2425
The victory consolidated Vitalian's position. With the spoils, he was able to lavishly reward his followers, and at the news of the imperial army's annihilation, the remaining cities and forts in Lower Moesia and Scythia surrendered to him. Soon after, he had another stroke of luck: at Sozopolis his men captured an embassy sent by Anastasius to ransom his nephew, including the ransom money of 1,100 pounds of gold. Hypatius however, whom Vitalian hated because he had once insulted his wife, was not released until a year later.2627 In 514, Vitalian marched again towards Constantinople, this time gathering, in addition to his army, a fleet of 200 vessels from the Black Sea ports, which sailed down the Bosporus menacing the city from the sea as well. Anastasius was further disquieted by riots in the city, which left many casualties, and resolved to deal again with Vitalian.2829 Vitalian accepted, on the conditions of his nomination to the post of magister militum per Thracias, the receipt of ransom money and gifts worth in total 5,000 pounds of gold for the release of Hypatius. Anastasius also conceded the restoration of the unaltered Trisagion, the restoration of the deposed Chalcedonian bishops and the convocation of a general church council at on 1 July 515 were further agreed on.303132
In the event, the council never materialized, since Pope Hormisdas and Anastasius continued to be at loggerheads over the Acacian Schism, and neither were the bishops returned to their sees. Seeing Anastasius failing to honour his promises, in late 515 Vitalian mobilized his army and marched again towards Constantinople.33 Vitalian's army captured the suburb of Sycae (modern Galata) across the Golden Horn from the city and encamped there. The two magistri militum praesentalis, Patricius and John, were unwilling to engage their old friend Vitalian, thus Anastasius entrusted command of his forces to the former praetorian prefect of the East, Marinus, a trusted and influential aide.34 Despite his lack of military experience, Marinus defeated the rebel fleet in a battle at the entrance of the Golden Horn; according to some reports, this was achieved through the use of a sulfur-based chemical substance, similar to the later Greek fire. Marinus then landed with his men on the shore of Sycae and defeated the rebels he found there. Disheartened by the losses suffered, Vitalian and his army fled north under cover of night.3536
Later life
Once back in northern Thrace, Vitalian went into hiding, while many of his erstwhile aides were captured and executed. For the next three years, nothing is known of him, although a short remark by a chronicler seems to indicate that he resurfaced and led another armed rebellion during the last months of Anastasius' life.37 When Anastasius died in July 518, he was succeeded by Justin I (r. 518&lt;U+2013&gt;527), the comes excubitorum. The new emperor quickly moved to strengthen his rule, dismissing a number of potential rivals or enemies. At the same time, he called upon Vitalian to come to Constantinople.38
Upon his arrival, Vitalian was made magister militum in praesenti, made honorary consul and soon after raised to the rank of patricius.39 As a well-known champion of Chalcedonian orthodoxy, Vitalian was to play a role in the new regime's affirmation of the Chalcedonian doctrines and reconciliation with Rome. Indeed he played an active role in the negotiations with the Pope, and in 519, he was one of the prominent men who escorted a papal delegation into the capital.404142
Finally, Vitalian was accorded the highest honor a Roman citizen could be awarded: he was named consul for 520, along with Fl. Rusticius. Nevertheless, the old rebel continued to pose a potential challenge to Justin, and more importantly, to his nephew and heir-apparent, Justinian. Thus, in July 520, he was murdered inside the Great Palace along with two close aides. According to John of Nikiou, he was plotting against Justin; most chroniclers however put the responsibility for the crime on Justinian's desire to rid himself of a potential rival for his uncle's succession.434445
