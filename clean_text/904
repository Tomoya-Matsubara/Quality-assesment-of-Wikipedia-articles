thumb|left|Gjende and other nearby lakes. Gjende (or Gjendin) is a lake in the Jotunheimen mountains in Norway's Jotunheimen National Park. The proglacial lake shows typical characteristics of glacial formation, being long and narrow—in length 18&lt;U+2009&gt;km and in breadth 1.5&lt;U+2009&gt;km at the broadest point with steep walls. Gjende has a characteristic light-green color resulting from the large quantity of rock flour which is discharged into the Gjende by the Muru river. The river Sjoa provides the outlet from Gjende at Gjendesheim, and flows eastward into the Gudbrandsdalsl&lt;U+00E5&gt;gen river.
Gjende lies in the middle of Jotunheimen National Park and both to the north and south of the lake lie peaks greater than 2,000&lt;U+2009&gt;m. There are numerous staffed tourist cabins maintained by the Norwegian Mountain Touring Association (DNT); in the west end lies Gjendebu, on the north side lies Memurubu and on the east end lies Gjendesheim. In the summer boats provide transport between these locations.
Cultural and literary references
Lake Gjende is found in literature and travel books from the 18th century. Together, the Jotunheimen lakes of Gjende and Bygdin play in many such descriptions. For example Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt took his famous wild-reindeer ride along &quot;the Gjendin Ridge&quot;, a reference to either the narrow Besseggen Ridge - or the Knutsh&lt;U+00F8&gt; ridge on the other side of lake Gjende.
The official name Gjende is taken from the Gudbrandsdal traditional district dialect used in Lom and V&lt;U+00E5&gt;g&lt;U+00E5&gt;. In the Vang dialect the lake is called Gjendin, which is the form you find in Henrik Ibsen's name for what is now called Besseggen, formerly Gjendineggen, or Gendineggen in the older orthography.
The lake gave its name to a famous early outdoors man and free thinker, Jo Gjende (1794—1884), who had a cabin at Gjende.
