Plot
Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is concerned that Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is stressed and under performing as the head writer of TGS with Tracy Jordan because of a lack of human contact. He suggests that she go on a date with his friend &quot;Thomas&quot;, which she initially refuses. When she almost chokes to death alone in her apartment that night, an action that Jack foreshadowed as &quot;a single woman's biggest worry,&quot; she changes her mind. She meets her date in a restaurant and finds that Jack has set her up with Gretchen Thomas (Stephanie March), a lesbian. Although Liz and Gretchen have great chemistry, Gretchen is not interested in chasing after a &quot;straight girl&quot;. The next day, Liz chastises Jack for thinking she was a lesbian. At night, Liz gets lonely and calls Gretchen. After sharing their fears as single women, they go to dinner. There, Gretchen expresses that she feels she is starting to chase the &quot;straight girl&quot; and says they should stop seeing each other. Liz attempts to make a pact that they get back together after 25 years and start a relationship then if they are both still single, but Gretchen walks away.
At the same time, poker night is a Thursday night tradition among Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), Josh Girard (Lonny Ross), Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James &quot;Toofer&quot; Spurlock (Keith Powell), and J. D. Lutz (John Lutz), the TGS staff. Jack and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) join them for the first time. Jack is able to read and defeat all of the other players, except for NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), who wins the final hand. The next day, Jack sets up another poker night. Eventually, Jack and Kenneth come down to the final hand. Jack has more chips and goes all-in. He offers to make the hand winner-take-all if Kenneth bets his page jacket. Kenneth agrees, and Jack's pair of twos beats Kenneth's king high. Liz asks why Kenneth would bet on a hand like that, and he responds that he enjoys living on the edge and was also confused about the rules. Jack stops Kenneth from leaving, explains that he only made Kenneth bet his job to prove his power over him, and returns the jacket to Kenneth with the expectation that he come in early on Monday.

Since airing, the episode has received generally positive reviews. Robert Canning of IGN praised the episode for &quot;playing to its strengths&quot;, and focusing on the series &quot;most fully realized characters&quot;, Liz and Jack. He pointed out that Tracy had &quot;leveled off significantly from his constant high&quot;, making him &quot;funnier in the process&quot;. Canning also enjoyed Kenneth's increased screen time and the lack of the Jenna Maroney character, played by Jane Krakowski.9 A television reviewer for the Chicago Tribune noted that the scenes between Jack and Liz are always &quot;a treat&quot; and enjoyed the scene in this episode in which Liz chastises Jack for thinking she was a lesbian. The reviewer also added that Judah Friedlander, Keith Powell, and Scott Adsit, who play Frank, Toofer, and Pete, respectively, &quot;haven't been given enough to do&quot;, and hoped that the show would produce funny moments from the writers' room.10 Sarah Warn of AfterEllen.com felt that for a single-episode lesbian sitcom character, Gretchen was &quot;one of the best we've seen&quot;. Warn also enjoyed the episode itself, calling it &quot;one of the funniest sitcom episodes I've seen so far this season&quot;.11 Kevin D. Thompson of The Palm Beach Post noted that &quot;Blind Date&quot; was one of the &quot;show's funniest episodes&quot;.12 A reviewer from the Richmond Times-Dispatch also praised the episode, citing that it was &quot;one of the show's best.&quot;13
