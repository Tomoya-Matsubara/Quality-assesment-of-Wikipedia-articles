The Apalachicola Kingsnake (also known as the Apalachicola Lowlands Kingsnake) is a non-venomous species of kingsnake found in a small area of the Florida panhandle known as the Apalachicola Lowlands. Long argued as to whether or not it is a sub-species, the Apalachicola Kingsnake was formerly named Lampropeltis getula goini. After years of research and many more specimens examined, in 2006 it was renamed to Lampropeltis getula meansi after D. Bruce Means, in recognition of his work on this species.
