He got his formal musical training from the Music program at &lt;U+00AB&gt;Voss gymnas&lt;U+00BB&gt; (1997-2000), which gave him the fundamental tools to understand music and continue studying on his own accord. Together with friends like Isak Strand he performed on various locations and recordings within local bands, for the most part solo or duo constellations.
Mikkelsen holds a Bachelor of Nursing at H&lt;U+00F8&gt;gskolen i Bergen (2006), and during his studies he traveled to Zansibar and got influences from African musical traditions there. Later, he moved to Copnhagen, where he started playing more blues, folk and jazz inspired music with the vocalist Pernille Koch, under the name &lt;U+00AB&gt;Her Name and Mine&lt;U+00BB&gt;, performing at the Dancing At Copenhagen Jazz Festival in the summer of 2013.2
