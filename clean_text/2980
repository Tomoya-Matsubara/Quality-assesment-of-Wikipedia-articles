Jane Haining was a Church of Scotland missionary.
Born in Dumfries, Scotland, in 1897, she volunteered for service in 1932 as a matron of the girls' home at the Scottish Mission School in Budapest, Hungary. At the outbreak of World War II she refused to return to Scotland as ordered, determined to remain with her girls. After the Nazi invasion of Hungary in 1944, she again refused to leave. Although she did not avoid incarceration by the Nazi regime, many of her pupils were spared deportation to Auschwitz. On July 27, 1944 she died &quot;in hospital&quot; at Auschwitz. She is one of a total of ten Scots thought to have been put to death in the Nazi extermination camps.
Among the memorials to Jane Haining are two stained glass windows in Queen's Park church, Glasgow, where she worshipped, and a plaque in the little Kirk of Dunscore. Pelicula Films are to produce a film about Haining titled There Are Mountains On The Road to Heaven. The film, a Hungarian co-production, will be backed by Scottish TV, Screen Screen and the European Commission. The director of the film will be Mark Littlewood and it will feature the talents of producer Ian Smith and screen writer Chris Dolan. The film will be based on interviews with four pupils who survived, Dr. Zsuzanna Pajs, Dr. Maria Kremer, Ibolya Suranyi (Budapest), and Annette Lantos (Washington) 1 2.
