The Aubert PA-20 Cigale lang-en Cicada, PA-204 Cigale Major and PA-205 Super Cigale were a family of high-wing cabin monoplanes built in France in the years immediately before and immediately after World War II.  The original Cigale was shown at the 1938 Paris Salon but its development was interrupted by the War. The Cigale was a high-wing cantilever monoplane of conventional configuration with fixed, Conventional landing gear tailwheel undercarriage.

Development
The original two-seat PA-20 Cigale first flew in 1938 powered by a Train 6T. Various refinements were made, including a change to a Renault 4Pei engine, and the aircraft was redesignated PA-201 Cigale. This original aircraft was destroyed during the course of World War II, but in 1945, Paul Aubert returned to the design, building another aircraft to the PA-201 standard. This went on to prove highly successful when flown competitively in 1945 and 1946. Aubert further modified his design into a four-seater, flying the PA-204 Cigale Major on 21 April 1947, and soon building a second example to this standard.

One of the PA-204s was subsequently re-engined first with a SNECMA 4L in 1951 PA-204S, and then with a Lycoming O-290-D2B PA-204L in 1955 and a Lycoming O-320 in 1956 PA-205 Super Cigale. With this engine, Aubert was finally satisfied with the design and built around thirty production examples, eight of which went to Aroclub Air France.
