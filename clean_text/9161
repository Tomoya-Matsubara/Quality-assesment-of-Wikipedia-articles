Berg is a station on the Sognsvann Line (line 3) of the Oslo Metro of Norway. It is located between Ullev&lt;U+00E5&gt;l stadion and T&lt;U+00E5&gt;sen and is the first station after Ring Line leaves the Sognsvann Line. The station is located  from Stortinget. Berg is among the original stations on the line, and was opened 10 October 1934. It was upgraded and rebuilt in the 1990s, when the Sognsvann Line was upgraded to metro standard. There were plans making Berg a station on the Ring Line, but research concluded that it would destroy the geography around Ullev&lt;U+00E5&gt;l and create noise pollution. Several accidents have taken place at Berg station, latest in 2008. The area around the station is mainly residential. Berg Upper Secondary School is located only 100 m from the station.
History
Berg station opened 10 October 1934, when the municipaly owned company Akersbanerne had built the line from Majorstuen to Sognsvann.1 residential areas at Sogn, T&lt;U+00E5&gt;sen and Berg were starting to grow, in pace with a larger suburban development plan named Solgryten ().2 Akersbanerne bought new property along the line,3 where new houses were to be drawn by the Norwegian architect Kristofer Lange (1886&lt;U+2013&gt;1977).4
The line was in the first place double-tracked from Majorstuen to &lt;U+00D8&gt;sthorn (then Korsvoll) and single-tracked to Sognsvann until 1939.5
In the 1980s, Berg was rebuilt, with platforms lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains, and the platform height increased. The third rail made it impossible to cross the lines at the stations, an underpass was therefore constructed Berg Station.6 The station was also rebuilt in the same architectural style as the other stations on the line. They are constructed in concrete with steel columns and wooden sheds and fences,7 with the sheds being drawn by Arne Henriksen.8
In 1991, Oslo Sporveier presented plans to make a ring line in Oslo, connecting the newly built hospital Rikshospitalet.9 A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996.10 In the local newspaper Aftenposten Aften there was a debate ongoing whether there should be a ring line from Berg along Ring 3 towards Gaustad over Rikshospitalet,11 or that the Ullev&lt;U+00E5&gt;l Hageby Line should be extended from John Colletts plass to Rikshospitalet, thus creating a correspondence with the Sognsvann Line at the new station Forskningsparken.12 In the first plans, Berg was meant to be a station on the new ring line, but was discarded since local residents feared noise pollution and destroyed lawns.13 Noise shields were however put op along the line.1415
Berg station has seen many accidents and almost-accidents. In 1965, a deadly accident occurred between Ullev&lt;U+00E5&gt;l and Berg stations, where a train whose driver did not see a 33-year-old man walking in the tracks.16 In 2002, a 24 years old man was run over by a metro train approaching the station.17 The man survived the accident with minor wounds.18 In 2008, a 21 years old drunk man was found crawling around on the tracks between the platforms.19 The police removed him from the station after short time and sent him home in a taxi.20
Service
Berg is served by line 3 on the Sognsvann Line, operated by Oslo T-banedrift on contract with Ruter. The rapid transit serves the station every 15 minutes, except in the late evening and on weekend mornings, when there is a 30-minute headway.21 Travel time along the  portion to Stortinget in the city center is 11 minutes.22
The station provides correspondence to the bus lines 23 and 24 at a nearby bus stop in Kaj Munks vei.23
Facilities
 &lt;U+00D8&gt;sthorn has two platforms, each with a wooden shed and ticket machines. The sheds are drawn by Arne Henriksen in the minimalist and standardized style with constructions of wood and steel that are to be found at all of Sognsvann Line's stations, except from Ullev&lt;U+00E5&gt;l stadion.2425

Berg is located in the borough of Nordre Aker, north of the residential areas Ullev&lt;U+00E5&gt;l Hageby, east of T&lt;U+00E5&gt;sen, south of Nordberg and west of Sogn.26 The area Berg is named after an old farm from 1264 with the same name.27 The street John Colletts all&lt;U+00E9&gt;, hailing from John Colletts plass in Ullev&lt;U+00E5&gt;l Hageby, ends at Berg station.2829 Kaj Munks vei, as part of the Norwegian National Road 150, also known as &quot;Ring 3&quot;, runs parallell with the line from Ullev&lt;U+00E5&gt;l stadion via Berg to T&lt;U+00E5&gt;sen, and continues thereafter towards Nydalen.30 The residential area around the station has many houses built in Swiss chalet and Functionalist style that were constructed in the 1990s.&quot;/&gt; Berg Upper Secondary School, is located  from the station.31
