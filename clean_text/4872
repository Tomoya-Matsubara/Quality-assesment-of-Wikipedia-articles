Early life
Merriman was born in Marlborough, Wiltshire, England, on 18 October 1818. His father was the lawyer Thomas Merriman (1771&lt;U+2013&gt;1841), and his mother was Mary Clarke (1780 &lt;U+2013&gt; after 1837). He was their eleventh child out of a total of 14 (nine boys, five girls).1 He was educated at Winchester. He was admitted to the bar and emigrated to Auckland in New Zealand in 1844.2
His brother Nathanial later became Bishop of Grahamstown.3
On 4 May 1850, he married Susannah Augusta Atkyns (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Greene) in St. Paul's Church, Auckland.4 She was the widow of Captain Ringrose Atkyns.

He commenced practice as a solicitor in the year of his arrival in Auckland. In 1856, he was joined by Samuel Jackson, and the firm became known as Merriman and Jackson. Upon Merriman's death, the firm was joined by James Russell and was renamed Jackson Russell. It is still known by this name today.6
