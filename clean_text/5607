The ancient Egyptian Branch hieroglyph, also called a Stick,1 is a member of the trees and plants hieroglyphs.
The branch is an Egyptian language biliteral with the value (kh)t, (khet); it is an ideogram-(determinative),2 for wood, tree, and the linear measure (=100 cubits).3 The hieroglyph is described as a branch without leaves.

As the value (kh)t, it is often complemented in a hieroglyphic block with kh Aa1, and &quot;t&quot; X1.

Iconographic usage
Pharaonic usage
Pharaoh Nectanebo II used the branch hieroglyph for his Nomen name of Nakhthoreb, &quot;Strong is His Lord, Beloved of Hathor&quot;.
Pharaoh Nectanebo I's nomen was Nekhtnebef, &quot;Strong is His Lord.&quot;
Old Kingdom usage

Object label of Pharaoh Den. 

Two labels are known from the Old Kingdom showing usage of the branch hieroglyph, one by Pharaoh Den, one by Semerkhet. The usage on the labels shows the branch hieroglyph in a more archaic form.
Rosetta Stone usage of branch--&quot;khet&quot;
In the 198 BC Rosetta Stone the branch hieroglyh is used six times, lines R1 combined with N23-(the Nabayrah Stele), R5, R6, R9, R13 and R14.4
The Rosetta Stone usage of the hieroglyph is somewhat distinctive:



line R1–M3:X1*Z1&quot;kh-t&quot;,
&quot;.... Were brought some of them (rebels) into White Wall (Memphis, Egypt-&quot;Aneb-Hetch-t&quot;), at the festival of the receiving behold of the kingdom from his father, slaying by placing [them] upon stakes[s].&quot;5





line R5–N35:M3:Aa1*X1-Z9:D40&quot;nekh-t&quot; for &quot;might&quot;-(Nike, as the goddess of Victory: Greek Nike)
&quot;.... As a reward for these things have given him (Ptolemy V) the gods and goddesses: victory, might, life, strength, health, (AUS) and everything good to the fullest possible extent of them;...&quot;6



line R6–Same usage of might, but instead strong:
&quot;.... Ptolemy, the Avenger of Baq-t the interpretation whereof is'' Ptolemy, the strong one of Kam-t-(Egypt)...&quot;''7



line R9–Used in a prepositional phrase: &quot;em-khet&quot;, literally vertical letter &quot;M&quot;-(vertical form of Gardiner U31, unlisted) with the branch hieroglyph.


lines R13/R14–M3:Aa1*X1-D40-Z7:X1-(ros-line13)-&quot;khet-tu&quot;, (both lines reconstructed except &quot;-tu&quot; of R13). &quot;To inscribe&quot;, upon the priest's rings, and on the Rosetta Stone, (i.e. the Decree of Memphis (Ptolemy V)), in the three scripts: Egyptian hieroglyphs, Egyptian Demotic, and the Greek language.



Variant forms

One common variant form of the branch hieroglyph is combined with the tree, M1, M1, and M3 in a ligature, Gardiner Aa40, Aa40, (there is also an Aa41 with the tree).

Example words

A wall relief inside the Great Temple of Abu Simbel shows Ramses II smiting Libyans. Young Ramses in a chariot is shown on the left, bow drawn, charging into Syrian ranks.8 On the right he is standing over one prone Libyan fighter, and is smiting another with a mace-club in his right hand, while holding the Libyan fighter with his extended left arm. The extensive military scenes are commemmorating his military victories,9 and the text explains the specifics of the events.
Above the clasped Libyan fighter is one column of text, (out of a series of about 15 columns, variable in height), describing the &quot;victory-buildings&quot;, the strongholds that the captives will be confined in. The text explains that Ramses and the Egyptian army went after three groups of rebels, and then confined them.

&quot;Smiting Libyan&quot; portion of extensive military relief section, Great Temple of Abu Simbel. 


Above the Libyan captive's arm is a column of text,10 (see here: 1), and the columns states: &quot;...the 'strong-buildings', ...constructed by pharaoh,...&quot; The last two hieroglyphs in the vertical text shows a vertical wall hieroglyph and constructing-man, and the horizontal arm holding a &quot;power scepter&quot;, (showing an action of force by one's arm-(hands), i.e. the constructing of the wall, the &quot;stronghold&quot; building). The hieroglyphs are Gardiner A35-(with foot raised onto side of wall-(variation)), A35, D40-(arm showing action of forse: Egyptian language: &quot;djser&quot;, for 'power'). D40 Combinded they are: A35:D40. The scene is also shown here-(expands into High-Res):11
