is one of the  fictional species of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon creatures from the multi-billion-dollar1 Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon media franchise—a collection of video games, anime, manga, books, trading cards, and other media created by Satoshi Tajiri. The purpose of Weedle in the games, anime, and manga, as with all other Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, is to battle both wild Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon—untamed creatures encountered while the player passes through various environments—and tamed Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon owned by Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon trainers.2
The name Weedle is probably a portmanteau of worm or weevil, and needle. The Japanese name Beedle is a portmanteau of the English words bee and needle. The name Weedle refers to both the species as a whole, as well as individual specimens in the games, anime and manga. Weedle is a dual Bug/Poison-type Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon resembling a golden-brown caterpillar. It evoles into a Kakuna, then into a Beedrill. In all versions, Weedle has a large stinger on the top of its head, as well as a pinkish nose. The Advanced Generation drawing and sprite design of Weedle was created by Ken Sugimori&lt;U+2019&gt;s team for Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon FireRed&lt;U+2019&gt;s 2003 release on the Nintendo Game Boy Advance.3
Biological characteristics
Commonly spotted in the forests and grasslands, eating leaves, it is well-protected from predators by a sharp two-inch barb on its head which secretes a strong poison, and another stinger on its rear. Sniffing with its big red proboscis, Weedle uses its extremely acute sense of smell to find the types of leaves it likes, avoiding those it dislikes. Shiny Weedle are a greenish-yellow. Weedle evolve into Kakuna, and then Beedrill.4
In the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon video games
Weedle can be caught in Kanto and Johto, and is often one of the first Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon a trainer encounters in the wild in various games which take place there, such as the originals, Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Red and Blue, and their enhanced remakes, FireRed and LeafGreen; however, it cannot be caught in Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Yellow. Before the protagonist can enter Viridian Forest, an elderly man demonstrates Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon catching technique (albeit without properly weakening the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon first) by capturing a Weedle.
Weedle are often caught by trainers beginning their Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon journey. Although Weedle are quite weak and only know Poison Sting and String Shot (making Weedle the only existing Pokemon that can't learn any Normal-type moves), they quickly evolve into Kakuna and then into Beedrill, which are fast, powerful physical attackers.
Bug types like Caterpie were originally susceptible to Poison attacks. This gave Weedle the upper hand against Caterpie, and, combined with Beedrill's speed, gave Beedrill a slight advantage in confrontations with Butterfree, until the Poison weakness of the Bug type was removed in the second generation of games. However, since Butterfree can learn Psychic and Flying-type attacks, it now has a distinct edge when facing combination Poison- and Bug-types such as Beedrill.
In the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon anime
The Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon anime series and films are a meta-series of adventures separate from the canon that most of the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon video games follow (with the exception of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Yellow, a game based on the anime storyline). The anime follows the quest of the main character, Ash Ketchum5&lt;U+2014&gt;an in-training Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Master&lt;U+2014&gt;as he, (as well as several other companions6), travel around the fictitious world of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon along with their Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon partners, Pikachu and Blaziken.7
A Weedle first appeared in the Episode 04, &quot;Challenge of the Samurai&quot;, in which Ash and Misty were travelling through the Viridian Forest. The pair came across a wild Weedle, and weakened it in attempting to capture. However, before he could throw the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt; Ball, Ash was distracted a young trainer, called Samurai, which gave the wild Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon time to flee, in turn, guiding its family of Beedrill to attack the group.8
Another Weedle appeared in Episode 163, &quot;The Bug Stops Here&quot;, during the Johto Bug-catching Contest, outside Goldenrod City. Ash and Pikachu spotted a wild Weedle, but Casey, a minor recurriting character who supports the fictitious baseball team, The Electabuzz team, used her Chikorita to capture it. Ash later won the contest, with a Beedrill, but gave her the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon because of her love for Yellow striped Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon.9
In the very first episode of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon: Diamond and Pearl, Weedle makes a short cameo being caught in the same web as Piplup.
Dawn's Piplup disguises as a Weedle in &quot;It's Love! Pokemon Transformation Convention!&quot; It is a bad impression (Piplup wears a Weedle mask with the body trailing behind its head, giving away Piplup's entire lower body) and she doesn't make it to the finals.

In other media
A Weedle appeared in Chapter 39, &quot;Just A Spearow Carrier&quot;, of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Adventures, a manga series based on the Japanese versions of the video games, owned by the female Pallet Town trainer, Green. While at the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon League, Red, the first main character based on the protagonist of the original games, saw Green attempting to trade her Weedle for a Butterfree, belong to a minor recurring character Fisherman Wilton. However Red stopped the trade, informing Wilton that the trade was unfair, much to Green's annoyance.10
The Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Trading Card Game is a collectible card game similar in goal to a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon battle in the video game series; players must use cards (with individual strengths and weaknesses) in an attempt to defeat their opponent by &quot;knocking out&quot; all of his cards.11 The game was first published in North America by Wizards of the Coast in 1999, until Nintendo USA started publishing the series in 2003.12 Most Weedle cards are typical, Basic Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon cards, and are primarily used to play stronger cards (such as Stage-1 Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, like Raichu, or Stage-2 Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, like Charizard).13 Weedle first appeared in the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Trading Card Game in the very first set of cards, the Base Set (included in Base Set 2 and the Legendary Collection). It has also appeared on cards from Gym Challenge (as Koga&lt;U+2019&gt;s Weedle), Neo Discovery, Skyridge (appears twice), EX FireRed &amp; LeafGreen, and EX Delta Species.14
