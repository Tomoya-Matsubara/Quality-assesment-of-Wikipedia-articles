Career
Early life and career
Born and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada, Ryan Reeves started watching wrestling at the age of five and was allowed to ring the bell at a live WWF event. 5 Wanting to become a professional wrestler, Reeves began weight lifting at 12 years old. He was nicknamed &quot;Silverback&quot; as a teenager, whom a childhood friend joked that he resembled a gorilla, and later adopted it as his ringname. 6 Reeves excelled at baseball and football while attending Western and Palo Verde High School. He played college baseball during his freshman year at the Community College of Southern Nevada, however he broke his foot and ended up missing two seasons.
Reeves spent the next two years concentrating on bodybuilding to enter professional wrestling. He also attended University of Nevada, Las Vegas, majoring in fitness management, 7 while working part-time at the Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino. By the time he applied to WWE Tough Enough in the fall of 2004, he stood at 6'1&quot; and weighed in at 280 lbs. Reeves sent a brief one minute videotape of himself and was invited to Venice Beach with 49 others. During the first week of training, Reeves suffered from bronchitis and a rib injury. He eventually became one of the eight finalists to appear on Smackdown and the last to be voted off. 8 9 Even though Reeves lost, he impressed WWE officials enough for them to sign him to a developmental contract. He would spend some time back in Las Vegas healing from his injuries before heading to Atlanta in March 2005. 10
Deep South Wrestling (2005-2006)
Reeves started training at Deep South Wrestling, a pro wrestling school located in McDonough, Georgia. On September 1, 2005, he made his official debut in a tag team match with Lash LeRoux against Team Elite (Derrick Neikirk &amp; Mike Knox) at the premiere show for DSW. During the next several weeks, he would team with Big Jack Bull, Ryan O'Reilly, Mike Mizanin and Nick Mitchell against tag teams including Team Elite, The Regulators and The Slaughter Brothers.
He began wrestling single matches a month later against Mike Shane, Mike Knox 11 and Palmer Cannon. On November 23, he entered a championship tournament for the DSW Heavyweight Championship and eliminated by Mac Johnson in the opening rounds. He also lost to Freakin Deacon on December 15. Several days later, he wrestled two matches in one night. The first was a tag team match with Damien Steele against The Regulators and the second was a singles match against Mike Knox, both matches he lost. 12
In January 2006, he formed a short-lived tag team with Ryan O'Reilly and faced Team Elite and The Gymini. Before the team could gain momentum, the WWE transferred Reeves from Deep South Wrestling, to Ohio Valley Wrestling two months later. Reeves wrestled his last match losing to Freakin Deacon on February 26, 2006.
Ohio Valley Wrestling (2006-2007)
After training in DSW for most of 2005 and early 2006, Reeves arrived in Ohio Valley Wrestling in early March. He defeated Kasey James, Pat Buck, Da Beast and Double N in dark matches during his two months and, with Mikey Batts, won victories over Billy Kryptonite &amp; Russell Simpson and Jack Bull &amp; Vic Devine.

In July 2006, Ryan Reeves was suspended for 30 days due to failing a drug test as part of the Wellness Program. 15 16 According to Reeves, he had been taking several over the counter bodybuilding supplements one of which inadvertently caused a false reading. The supplements he was using were later taken off if market due to this effect and, although his suspension remained in place, Reeves eventually returned to the roster after passing a second test. 17 His case was later featured on the CNN documentary Death Grip: Inside Pro Wrestling. 18
High Dosage
After his previous 30 day suspension, Reeves got even bigger, as well as bleaching his hair blonde. After changing his look, Reeves returned to wrestling on a number of OVW shows including an impressive victory over Johnny Punch, Rod Steele, Ramon Loco, Mr. Strongko, Mike Kruel, Shad Gaspard and Charles Evans in a gauntlet match on August 19. In September 2006, Reeves began teaming with Jon Bolen, who together became known as High Dosage. Scoring early victories against teams such as Los Locos (Aaron Lamata &amp; Lowrider) and Johnny Punch &amp; Pat Buck, they began feuding with the then newly formed team of Eddie Craven, Mike Kruel and &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; Shawn Osborne.
The two did not fare well against the trio loosing both tag team and single matches to them during the next few weeks. On October 18, he and Bolen also lost to them in a handicap match. Things soon changed however when High Dosage beat Eddie Craven &amp; Mike Kruel a month later. As a result of their victory, they were allowed five minutes alone with Shawn Osbourne but he was able to escape with the help of Eddie Craven &amp; Mike Kruel. Although continuing to face their rivals throughout the year, High Dosage also won matches against Los Locos and Bad Company defeating the latter in a Handicap Coal Miner's Glove on a Pole match on November 29. On December 9, High Dosage teamed with Seth Skyfire and lost to Eddie Craven, Mike Kruel &amp; Milena Roucka. Reeves also took part in a four-way Elimination Christmas Present match with Mike Kruel four days later. The participants included Justin LaRoche &amp; Charles Evans, T.J. Dalton &amp; Steve Lewington and Seth Skyfire &amp; Paul Burchill who eventually won the match.
