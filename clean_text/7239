The music of the video game The Last of Us was composed by musician Gustavo Santaolalla. The game's soundtrack was released on iTunes in June 2013. An additional soundtrack featuring compositions from the game's downloadable content The Last of Us: Left Behind was released in February 2014. Santaolalla, known for his minimalist approach to composing, began working on the music early in the game's development. He used various instruments to compose the score, including various that he was unfamiliar with. In the context of the game, the music was well received.
Creation and influence
 Throughout development of The Last of Us, creative director Neil Druckmann and game director Bruce Straley had been compiling various musical tracks that they found inspirational. When searching for a composer to work on the game's music, they realised that many of the compiled tracks were composed by Gustavo Santaolalla. Straley described Santaolalla's music as &quot;organic instrumentation, minimalist, dissonance and resonance with the sounds&quot;.1 As a result, Sony reached out to Santaolalla, who agreed to work on the game's soundtrack.2 After hearing the game's pitch, Santaolalla was excited to work on the game; he previously wanted to work on video games, but refused to work on those without a focus on story and characters.3
Due to Santaolalla's stance on composing music&lt;U+2014&gt;he lacks knowledge in reading and writing sheet music, preferring to simply record&lt;U+2014&gt;he began working on The Last of Us early in development. To give Santaolalla a point to base his music, Druckmann simply told him about the story and themes, as opposed to giving specific instructions on composing; Santaolalla appreciated this freedom, feeling it assisted in the composing. To compose, Santaolalla felt the need to &quot;go into some more dark place, more textural and not necessarily melodic&quot;.4 To challenge himself, Santaolalla used a variety of unique instruments he was unfamiliar with, giving a sense of danger and innocence. For The Last of Us, he used a detuned guitar, producing deep noise. To produce unique tunes, Santaolalla recorded in various rooms, including a bathroom and kitchen.5 The team wanted the game's AI to affect the music. They also tried to make the music evoke a reaction from the player, as their familiarization with the sounds would trigger a previous emotion that they felt. Music manager Jonathan Mayer felt that the game's action music was atypical of action music in other games, stating that it's &quot;relatively low-key&quot;, and that taking it out of context changes the immediate reaction to it.6 The game's theme, &quot;The Last of Us&quot;, was the first piece of music that the team received, and they were very impressed.7 The team aimed for a soundtrack that was &quot;emotional&quot;, as opposed to being scary.8 Inspired by the sparing use of music in the film No Country for Old Men (2007), the team used music judiciously and tried to find other ways to &quot;make your palms sweaty&quot;.9 The orchestral portions of the score were recorded at Ocean Way Studios in Nashville by the Nashville Scoring Orchestra.10
Aside from the official soundtracks, licensed tracks also appear in the game. In the main game, during the section aptly titled &quot;Alone and Forsaken&quot;, Joel and Ellie listen to the songs &quot;I'll Never Get Out Of This World Alive&quot; and &quot;Alone and Forsaken&quot; both by Hank Williams.11 In Left Behind, Ellie and Riley dance to the Etta James cover of the song &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;. In addition, &quot;String Quartet No. 3 in E-Flat Minor, Op. 30&quot; by Tchaikovsky and &quot;String Quarter No. 4 in E-Minor (B.19)&quot; by Antonin Dvorak are also present in Left Behind.12
