Rock'n Coke is a Turkish rock festival sponsored by Coca-Cola. It is traditionally held at the Hezarfen Airfield in Istanbul, Turkey.
Festival
Rock'n Coke is a member of the European Festival Association. The festival is organized by the Turkish concert organizer Pozitif. At the end of every summer, the Hezarfen Airfield is used as a venue for a two day chain of concerts, with both national and international performers featured.
Although mainly rock-oriented, Rock'n Coke also hosts other music genres. While the main stage is generally reserved for rock and its subgenres, the DJ Arena (now called Burn Stage, following the sponsorship) is reserved for styles such as house music.
In 2005, the festival grounds were large enough to support two stages, a mini-amusement park, two large food areas, a shopping area, several sponsor attractions, 400 outhouses and a large camp site for people with two-day tickets. The total area used by the festival was around 60 acres (250 d&lt;U+00F6&gt;n&lt;U+00FC&gt;m).
Controversy
Another large-scale rock festival in Istanbul, Bar&lt;U+0131&gt;&lt;U+015F&gt;arock (Rock for Peace), positions itself as the alternative counter-festival to Rock'n Coke, stating that being used as a tool of advertisement for a global company (Coca Cola) is against the nature of rock music. The festival is organized with free entrance since 2003 (the same year Rock'n Coke initiated) until 2008.
In 2008, Rock'n Coke organizers Pozitif Productions announced there would be no festival this year, but vowed to return in 2009.
The organisation announces on their website that the event will now be held every other year instead of each year. The next event will be in 2011.
