Vedda language is a language used by the indigenous Vedda people of Sri Lanka. Communities that do not identify themselves strictly as Veddas such as Coast Veddas and Anuradhapura Veddas also use Vedda language in part for communication during hunting and or for religious chants. A systematic field study was conducted in 1959 and then the language was confined to the older generation of Veddas from Dambana. In 1990's self identifying Veddas knew few words and phrases in Vedda language but there were individuals who knew the language comprehensively. Initially there was considerable debate amongst linguists as to whether Vedda is a dialect of Sinhalese or an independent language. Later studies indicate that it diverged from its parent stock in the 10 century ACE and became a Creole and a stable independent language by the 13 century ACE under the influence from Sinhalese. The parent Vedda language(s) is of unknown genetic origins while Sinhalese is of Indo-Aryan sub family origin. Phonologically it is distinguished from Sinhalese by the higher frequency of palatal sounds C and J. The effect is also heightened by the addition of inanimate suffixes. Morphologically Vedda language word class is divided in to nouns, verbs and invariables with unique gender distinctions in animate nouns. Per its Creole tradition, it has reduced and simplified many forms of Sinhalese such as second person pronouns and denotations of negative meanings. Instead borrowing new words from Sinhalese or other languages Vedda language creates combinations of words from a limited lexical stock. Vedda also maintains many archaic Sinhalese terms from the 10 to 12 century ACE , as a relict of its close contact with Sinhalese. Vedda language also retains number of words that are unique to it and cannot be derived from Sinhalese. Sinhalese has also borrowed from the original Vedda language, words and grammatical structures differentiating it from its related Indo-Aryan languages. Vedda language has exerted a substratum influence in the formation Sinhalese.
History

Ancestors of Veddas migrated to Sri Lanka via the Indian sub continent during the pre-historic period. A number of Mesolithic sites have been excavated containing human remains dated to 28,000 BCE.1Anthropologists consider these skeletal remains to belong to a group ancestral to some of the surviving Vedda groups.2 There are also Megalithic burial sites, which were excavated at Kathiraveli and Pomparippu dated to 10 century BCE.34 It is unknown as to the languages spoken by these early human populations of Sri Lanka prior to its settlement by Prakrit language speaking Indian immigrant groups in the 5th century BCE. Linguists have tried to link these early Vedda languages to Dravidian languages, Munda languages or an altogether independent language families.56 The Sinhalese term Vedda is a generic term denoting hunter gatherers without any connotations as to ethnic affiliations. In Tamil they are known as Vedar denoting a hunter. Similar terms are used throughout South India to describe primitive hunter gatherers.7 Sri Lanka has had other communities in the early history associated with tribal and hunting gathering life styles. (See Rodiya, Kinnaraya and Rodiya language)89
The earliest account of the Vedda language was written by Ryklof Van Goens (1663-1675) who served as a Director General of the Dutch East India Company in Sri Lanka. He wrote that their language was much closer to Sinhalese than Tamil.10 Robert Knox an Englishman held captive by Kandyan king, wrote in 1681 that the wild and settled Veddas spoke the language of the Sinhalese people. Portuguase friar Fernao de Queroz wrote a nuanced description of the Vedda language in 1686, that the language was not mutually intelligible with the native languages.11 Robert Percival wrote in 1803 that the Veddas although seemingly speaking a broken dialect of Sinhalese, amongst themselves speak a language that is only known to them.12 But in John Davies in 1831 wrote that the Veddas spoke a language that was understood by the Sinhalese except a few words. These discrepancies in observations were clarified by Charles Pridham who wrote in 1848 that the Veddas knew a form of Sinhalese that they were able to use to talk to outsiders but to themselves they spoke in a language although influenced mostly by Sinhalese and Tamil that was only understood by them.13
The first systematic attempt at studying the Vedda language was undertaken by Hugh Neville, an English civil servant in British Ceylon. He founded the Taprobanian, a quarterly journal devoted to the study of everything Ceylonese. He speculated based on etymological studies that the Vedda language is based on Old Sinhalese form called Hela.14 This was followed by Parker who wrote that most Vedda language words were borrowed from Sinhlaese but he also noted words of unique origin that he assigned to the original language of the Veddas.15 The second most important study was made by Wilhem Geiger in 1935 who also sounded the alarm that the Vedda language would be soon be extinct and needs to be studied in detail.16 One of the linguists to head to that call was Manniku W. Sugathapala De Silva who did a compressive study of the language in 1959. He went to on get his PhD on that thesis as well published a book on that hypothesis.17 according to him, the language was restricted to the older geneartion of people from the Dambanna region with younger generation shifting to Sinhalese. Where as Coast Veddas speak a dialect of Sri Lankan Tamil that is used in the region. During religious festivals, people who enter a trance or spirit possession sometimes use a mixed language that contains words from the Vedda language.1819 Veddas of the Anuradhapura region speak in Sinhalese, but use Vedda language to denote animals during hunting trips.2021
Classification
Early linguists and observers of the language considered it to be either a separate language or a dialect of Sinhalese. The chief proponent of the dialect theory was Wilhem Geiger but he also contradicted himself by claiming that Veddas was a reflexified aboriginal language.22 The first comprehensive study of the language was undertaken by Manikku W. Sugathapala de Silva in 1959, he along with K. N. O Dharmadasa have put forward the view that Vedda language is a Creole. According to De Silva, Vedda language is a Creole based on the original Vedda language with Sinhalese as the second most important contributing factor which is supported by Geiger view that Vedda is a relexified aboriginal language.23 De Silva concluded that although the Creole had borrowed profusely from Sinhalese vocabulary, its morphology was very distinct.24 He also concluded that Vedda language still contains in its vocabulary terms that was unknown to the Sinhalese. He wrote that grammatically Vedda remained still distinct from Sinhalese.25 In 1990 K.N.O Dharmadasa wrote that irrespective claims about whether the Vedda form in use in the 1990s is an independent language or a Creole, the peculiarities of the language made it still a distinct linguistic form different from all varieties of Sinhalese
According to De Silva and Dharmadasa, when the colonization of island by various Indian settlers using common Prakrits in use in India began in 5th century BCE, some elements of the Vedda coalesced with the settlers and lost their language through language replacement.26 Where as more conservative elements maintaining a hunter gatherer lifestyle moved into the central highlands known in early literature as Malaya Rata. Most Indian settlers colonized the North, Northwestern, Eastern and South Eastern lowlands of the country leaving the heavily forested central high lands to the ancestors of Veddas.27 With the collapse of the lowland dry zone civilization starting in the 9th century, descendants of the Indian settlers who had begun to speak Sinhalese moved in the central highlands. The trade and other connections made by the speakers of completely different languages such as Sinhalese and Vedda language(s) unknown genetic affinities gave rise to a period of use of a Pidgin of the languages. 28 There were borrowings of limited number of terms related trade and eventually daily life by the elites of the Vedda from Sinhalese that was eventually adopted the rest of the Veddas. The Veddas also seemed to have moved further way from Sinhalese contact by moving into inaccessible forests of Binttanne and now reforested former dry zone areas. This led to the arresting of the contact between the language communities thus allowing new Vedda language to stabilize and become an independent language. As a relict of this limited period of contact, Vedda language maintains many archaic Sinhalese words that were in vogue during that period. These words have gone out of use in contemporary Sinhalese. Veddas consider the Vedda language to be distinct from Sinhalese and use it as an ethnic marker to differentiate them from Sinhalese people.29
Vedda Grammar
 In Sinhalese indicative sentences are negated by adding a negative particle to the emphatic form of the verb where as Vedda, the negative particle is added to the infinite. In Sinhalese all indicative sentences whether negative or affirmative, exhibits two tenses &lt;U+2013&gt; past and non past but in Vedda a three term tense system is used in affirmative sentences but not in negative. Sinhalese pro nouns have number distinction but Vedda does not have number distinction. The Vedda verbal and nominal inflexions are similar to Sinhalese but are not identical. Vedda also exhibits a gender classification in inanimate and animate nouns.30
Phonology
Although phonemic inventory Vedda is very similar to Sinhalese, but in phonotactics it&lt;U+2019&gt;s is very dissimilar to Sinhalese. The usage of palatal affricates c (sounds similar to ch in Church) and J (sounds similar to J in Judge) is very high in Vedda language. Some comparisons

This effect is heightened by the addition of inanimate suffixes such as pojja, gejja or raacca. These suffixes are used in tandem with borrowings from Sinhalese.

32
These transformations are very similar to what we see in other Creole languages like Melanesian Pidgin English and Jamaican English Creole.33 The preponderance of the palatal affricates is explained as a left over from days when the original Vedda language which had a high frequency of such phonemes.34
Morphology
Formerly distinct Vedda nouns have two types of suffixes, one for animate and another for inanimate.
Animate nouns
The animate suffixes are &lt;U+2013&gt;atto for personal pronouns and &lt;U+2013&gt;laatto for all other animate nouns and - pojja and -raaccaa for personified nouns. Examples are

deyyalaato (god)
pannilaatto (worm)
meeatto( I or we)
irapojja (sun)
giniraaccaa (fire)

These suffixes are also used in singular and plural meaning based from the verbal and non verbal context.

botakandaa nam puccakaduvaa huura meeatto (Sir, I killed the elephant though)
meeattanne kiriamilaatto kalaapojjen mangaccana kota eeattanne badapojje kakulek randaala indatibaala tibenava (When our great grandmother was walking in the forest there was a child conceived in that one&lt;U+2019&gt;s womb.)

the dependance on verbal (and non verbal) context for semantic specification, which is accomplished by inflectional devices by natural languges is an indication of a contact languge.
certain words that appear to be from original Vedda language do not have these suffixes, also animate nouns also have gender distinctions, with small animals treated as feminine (i marker) and larger ones masculine (a marker)

botakanda (elephant)
kankunaa (deer)
karia (bear)
hatera (bear)
okma (buffalo)
kandaarni (bee)
mundi (monitor lizard)
potti (bee)
makini (spider)
ikini (louse)35

Inanimate nouns
Inanimate nouns use suffixes such as &lt;U+2013&gt;rukula and &lt;U+2013&gt;danda with nouns denoting body parts and other suffixes such as -pojja, -tana, and -gejja. Suffixes are used when the words are borrowed from Sinhalese.

ayrukula (eye)
ugurudanda (throat)
veedipojja (street)
kirigejja (coconut)
kavitana (verse)
giniracca (fire)36

There are number of forms that are from the original Vedda language that dont have suffixes such as

galrakki (axe)
caalava (pot)
bucca (bush)

Vedda inanimate nouns are formed by borrowing Sinhalese adjectives and adding a suffix. Kavi is Sinhalese adjective for Kaviya the noun but where as Vedda noun is kavi(tana).
Pronouns
Examples of pronouns are meeatto (I), topan (you), eyaba (there), koyba (where?). Compared to Sinhalese which requires five forms to address people based on status, Vedda uses one (topann) irrpective of status. These pronouns are also used in both singular and plural denotations.

Numerals
These are found in definite and indefinite forms. ekama one (def.) and ekamak once (indef.) They count ekamay, dekamay and tunamay. Vedda language also reduces the numer formations found in Sinhalese.

Lexicon
Many of the Vedda words are directly borrowed from Sinhalese or Tamil via Sinhalese while maintaining words that are not derivable from Sinhalese or its cognate languages from the Indo-Aryan language group. Vedda also exhibits a propensity for paraphrases and it coins words from its limited lexical stock rather than to borrow words from other languages including Sinhalese. For example

41
Archaic terms
Vedda maintains in its lexicon Archaic Sinhalese words that are no longer in daily usage. These archaic words are attested from classical Sinhalese prose from the 10th century until the 13 century, the purported period of close contact between the original Vedda language(s) and Old Sinhala leading to the development of the Creole. Some examples are

devla in Vedda means Sky but a 10 century Sinhalese exegetical work called Dhampia Atuva Getapadaya, it is used in the meaning of cloud.


diyamaccca in Vedda meaning fish is similar to diyamas found in a 10th century monastic work called Sikhavalanda.


manda in Vedda means near or with. This word is attested in the 12 century eulogy called Butsarana.


koomantana meaning wearing apparel is similar to the Sinhalese word Konama found in the 13 century work Ummagga Jatakaya alternatively komanam in Tamil is a loincloth, a cloth worn by early Veddas.42

Substratum influence in Sinhalese
According to Geiger, Sinhalese language has features that set&lt;U+2019&gt;s apart from other Indo-Aryan languages. Some of the differences can be explained by the substrate influence of parent stock of the Vedda language.43 Sinhalese has many words that are only found in Sinhalese or it is shared between Sinhalese and Vedda language and cannot be etymologically derived from Middle or Old Indo-Aryan. Common examples are Kola in Sinhalese and Vedda for leaf, Dola in Sinhalese for Pig and offering in Vedda. Other common words are Rera for wild duck and Gala for stones in Toponyms found throughout the island.44 There are also high frequency words denoting body parts in Sinhalese such s Olluva for head, Kakula for leg, bella for neck and kalava for thighs that are derived from pre-Sinhalese languages of Sri Lanka.45The author of the oldest Sinhalese grammar, Sidatsangarava, written in the 13th century ACE have recognized a category of words that exclusively belonged to early Sinhalese. It lists naramba (to see) and kolamba (ford or habor) as belonging to an indigenous source. Kolamba is the source of the name of the commercial capital Colombo.4647

Pre historic Sri Lanka experienced an intrusive early Iron Age (EIA) cultural diffusion from South India prior to the recorded arrival of Prakrit language speakers in 5th century BCE. The EIA is dated to 10th century BCE and is associated with the megalithic burial cultures of Pomparippu and other locations. Its counter part is found in the Southern Tamil Nadu region of India. Associated with the EIA culture are introduction of domesticated horse, iron implements, megalithic burial practices such as urn burials and tank based paddy cultivation. It is unknown as to the language(s) used by this EIA culture.↩

Vedars or Coast Veddas consider themselves and are considered by the Sri Lankan Tamils as a caste (kulam or jati in Tamil), rather than an ethnic group. Nevertheless there is considerable debate amongst Vedars and their Tamil neighbors to their status within the caste system, Vedars claiming very high status and their neighbors assigning somewhat lower status. Vedars use the Sri Lankan Tamil dialect peculiar to that region called Batticaloa Tamil dialect in their day to day conversations. Vedar children also study in that language in schools. But during religious (Sadangu in Tamil) ceremonies, those who are possessed by spirits speak in a mixed language that they call Vedar Sinkalam(Vedar Sinhala&quot;) or Vedar Bhasai (&quot;Vedar langugage&quot;)which is Vedda language of the interior Vedas. Vedar Sinkalam is mixed with many Tamil words, as people no longer know the language. At some point in the past that the people were bilingual in Vedda language and Tamil, but that is no longer the case.↩

In the late 1800&lt;U+2019&gt;s, Veddas of Anuradhapura did not identify themselves as Veddas to Parker and other British ethnologists. They self identified themselves as Vanniyas or people of the forest. But to James Brow an anthropologists who studied then in 1970&lt;U+2019&gt;s they readily identified themselves as Veddas. Parker recorded number of hunting terms used by the Vanniyas that were similar to what the Veddas of Bintanne region used as part of their Vedda language.↩
