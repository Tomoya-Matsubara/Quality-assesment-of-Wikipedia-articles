Edward Forset or Forsett (1553 - 1630) was an English writer, known for political works and as a playwright.
A justice of the peace, he was involved on the prosecution side of the 1605 Gunpowder Plot.12
In A Comparative Discourse (1606) he contributed to the traditional monarchist theory of the king&lt;U+2019&gt;s two bodies: the body politic and the body natural.3 This is considered one important source for later divine right and royalist ideas, as well as spinning out the bodily metaphor (the King as the heart).
The 1624 Defence of the Right of Kings was a belated reply to writings of the Jesuit Robert Parsons.
His Pedantius was a Latin comedy. It made fun of Gabriel Harvey.4
