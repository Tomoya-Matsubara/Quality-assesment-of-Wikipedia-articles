&quot;A Tale of Two Springfields&quot; is the second episode from season twelve of the animated TV series The Simpsons and is the 250th episode of the series overall in both broadcast and production order. The episode originally premiered November 5, 2000 on Fox Broadcasting Company.
While calling Animal Control over a badger taking residence in Santa's Little Helper's doghouse, Homer discovers that Springfield has two different area codes&lt;U+2014&gt;and ends up leading a revolt that splits the town in two.
The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Shaun Cashman and guest starred The Who. The episode was inspired by Don Payne based on Don's mom area where one side would spread rumors of the other side. Larry Doyle then pitched it to have the both sides divide, because of area code. The episode features cultural references to The Who and Freedom of Speech and has also received positive reviews from critics.
Plot
A badger takes up residence in Santa's Little Helper's doghouse. After several failed attempts to lure it out (including Homer crawling into the kennel, thinking it is Milhouse but gets attacked by the badger), Homer calls animal control. When he is unable to get through, Marge explains that the phone company has introduced a new area code to Springfield. Half of the town now has a 636 area code, the other has 939. At a town meeting to explain the change, Homer rallies an angry mob to protest the change, noting that the upper class side of town got to keep their area code while the poorer half were forced to switch. Homer proposes that the town split into two halves, and the mob agrees.
Homer is declared mayor of New Springfield and tensions immediately arise between the two towns. Olde Springfield businesses begin discriminating against customers from New Springfield, and condescending to them on the nightly news. Bart and Homer shut off power to Olde Springfield and cut off their water supply in retaliation. When the lack of water reveals gold in the river bed, making the town even richer, an enraged Homer has a wall built between the two towns. However, a lack of supplies and sanitation drives away all of the New Springfield residents, who stream over the wall, leaving the Simpsons alone.
Bitter, Homer attempts to sabotage a concert in Olde Springfield by The Who. He and Bart sneak into The Who's hotel room and convince them to play New Springfield instead. When Olde Springfield realizes that their concert has been stolen, they follow the sound of the music to the wall, where The Who are playing for an audience of The Simpsons. A riot begins to break out as the two sides of town begin hurling flaming garbage at each other. The members of The Who hear about the area code problem and suggest that the townspeople get speed dial to resolve their differences. Roger Daltrey's scream from &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; crumbles the wall, and the citizens of Springfield reunite and dance to the music. Meanwhile the badger leads an animal invasion of the town to &quot;get 'em while they're dancing&quot;.
Production
The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Shaun Cashman. The episode was pitched by John Frink and Don Payne. The episode was inspired Don Payne's mother's neighborhood where one side would spread rumors of the other side. Larry Doyle then pitched that the sides split apart to be started by different area code.1 During production the staff did not want one side to be slobs (e.g. Homer, Barney, Moe) and the other snobs (e.g. Mr. Burns, Smithers, Skinner), but this ended happening in the final product.2 The writers later opened a website about What badgers eat.3
The phone from the educational cartoon was voiced by Dan Castellaneta.4 Pete Townshend did not guest in the episode as he did not know he would be providing his own voice and assumed someone else would like in Yellow Submarine.5 Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle and Pete's brother, Paul Townshend provided guest voices in the episode. After a number of calls were made by the show's casting director in Los Angeles to The Who's managers in London, the group agreed to appear on the show. The animated versions of the band members included Daltrey in his trademark tight t-shirt and long curls, even though Daltrey cut the curls in the mid 1980's as they wanted to use the image The Who they are best known for. The Who recorded their lines in England, but still weighed in on script details. During the production the staff decided to animate Keith Moon instead of the current drummer in honor of him since he died in 1978.6
Deleted scenes

When Roger hits Marge with his microphone Roger Daltrey improvised and said &quot;Shut the fuck up, Marge&quot;. This was later included on The Simpsons Complete Twelfth Season DVD Deleted Scenes.7

Cultural references
 The episode title is a play on Charles Dickens' novel, A Tale of Two Cities. When Homer stands up in the press conference it is a references to the painting Norman Rockwell's Four Freedoms with this specific painting being Freedom of Speech.8 When Homer and Marge take a picture is an in-joke to &quot;Trash of the Titans&quot; when the voice director told Bono to smile.9 The episode also features several references to The Who, including &quot;Magic Bus&quot; and Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy.10 Moe's comment &quot;That fat, dumb, and bald guy sure plays a mean hardball&quot; is a reference to a Who song, &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;.
Reception
The episode got a 3.96 out of 5 ranking 102 out of 373 episodes.11 Mort of the TV Legion said the episode is a memorable one.12 Colin Jacobson of the DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a positive review saying &quot;Maybe it&lt;U+2019&gt;s the low expectations that accompany 21st century Simpsons episodes, but &lt;U+201C&gt;Tale&lt;U+201D&gt; works for me. It takes a simple premise and turns in a good number of strong comedic bits. Hey, and a mention of &lt;U+201C&gt;golden showers&lt;U+201D&gt; keeps the Season 12 perverted sexual practices streak going!&quot; although he criticized the animation of The Who other than Daltrey, saying that &quot;That&lt;U+2019&gt;s particularly odd in the case of Pete, as he&lt;U+2019&gt;d gone awfully bald and gray by 2000.&quot;13 Jennifer Malkowski of the DVD Verdict said the Greatest Moment was a tie between &quot;Sacred bond&quot; and &quot;Who huddle.&quot;14 Nancy Basile of About.com gave the episode a 5 writing &quot;Finally! I loved this episode because, flashy guest stars aside, it got back to the heart and soul of the show.&quot;15 There was a backlash from the internet with Homer's internals being visible.16
