Herne Hill railway station is a passenger railway station in Herne Hill in the London Borough of Lambeth, South London, England, on the boundary between London fare zones 2 and 3. Direct rail services are provided by First Capital Connect to London Blackfriars, Farringdon, St. Pancras International and Luton Airport on the Thameslink route and by Southeastern to London Victoria and Orpington on the Chatham Main Line. Trains to Victoria call at Brixton, where passengers can transfer to the London Underground.
The station building on Railton Road was opened in 1862 by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. Initially passengers could travel only to Victoria, but by 1869 direct services were available to the City of London, King's Cross, Kingston (via Wimbledon) and Kent, including express trains to Dover Harbour for boat trains to continental Europe. The arrival of the railways transformed Herne Hill from a wealthy suburb with large residential estates into a densely populated urban area.
The future pattern of passenger services is uncertain. Network Rail has recommended terminating all northbound First Capital Connect services from Herne Hill at Blackfriars from 2018; passengers for other central London stations on the Thameslink route would then have to change trains at Blackfriars.
Description
Herne Hill railway station sits at the bottom of the hill that gives the area its name and is close to Brockwell Park.1 The section of Railton Road outside the station is mixed usage for pedestrians and vehicles.2
The Chatham Main Line and Sutton Loop railway lines through Herne Hill are elevated above road-level on a brick viaduct that runs north&lt;U+2013&gt;south. The station's 1862 Gothic, polychrome brick3 building is on the western side of the viaduct, although passengers can also access the station from the east via a foot tunnel entrance on Milkwood Road.4 The building houses a ticket office and newsagent, and was Grade II listed in 1998: the listing notes the station's arched doorways, Welsh slate roof and decorative brickwork.5 It was described by Cherry and Pevsner as a &quot;handsome group&quot;6 and featured on the cover of a book about London's railway architecture.7
The four platforms are split between two island platforms;8 northbound trains call at the western platform and southbound trains at the eastern platform,9 providing passengers with cross-platform interchange between the two routes.
There are flat junctions at each end of the station: Herne Hill North Junction, where the lines to Loughborough Junction and Brixton stations diverge; and Herne Hill South Junction, where the lines to West Dulwich and Tulse Hill stations diverge.10 First Capital Connect and Southeastern services must cross each other's paths at the junctions, constraining capacity on both routes.11 The station also has a turnback siding (requiring the driver to change from one end of the train to the other) on its eastern side, adjacent to Milkwood Road.12
History
The area now known as Herne Hill had been a rural part of the Manor of Milkwell since the 13th century.13 Two tributaries of the River Effra met at the undeveloped site of the future station;14 it was known as Island Green until the 18th century.15
In 1783, a timber merchant, Samuel Sanders, bought Herne Hill from the Manor.16 Sanders granted leases for large plots of land to wealthy families – John Ruskin spent his childhood at an estate on Herne Hill. The Effra was covered over in the 1820s;17 and the area had become an upper-class suburb by the mid-19th century (a contemporary author referred to the hill as &quot;the Elysium&quot; for merchants).18 The opening of the railway station, which provided convenient and cheap access to central London, started the urbanisation of Herne Hill.1920 All of the large estates were eventually cleared to make way for many smaller houses.21 An 1870 railway travel guide noted the population of Herne Hill was 701;22 the contemporaneous development of new residential streets would increase the population by 3,000.23
Construction
In the late 1850s, the East Kent Railway had ambitions to run passenger trains between Kent and London, but it did not own any railway lines in inner London. It reached an agreement with the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) in 1858 to use its West End and Crystal Palace line to access Battersea and (from 1860) Victoria. This arrangement incurred costly access fees, but it was necessary until the company obtained Parliamentary authority to build in London.2425
In August 1860, the Metropolitan Extensions Act granted the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR; the successor to the East Kent company) the right to build two inner London lines: one from Beckenham Junction to Victoria via Herne Hill; and another, a  extension known as the City Branch, from Herne Hill to Farringdon.26 Herne Hill station and the first line section to be completed, from Victoria to Herne Hill via Stewarts Lane and , opened on 25 August 1862.27  The station was designed by architect John Taylor28 and railway engineers Joseph Cubitt and J.T. Turner.29 The building was intended to impress: it had tea rooms offering buffets,30 decorative brickwork and a tower (which also served the practical function of concealing the water tank for steam locomotives).31 The Building News described the station in 1863 as &quot;spacious and convenient ... and of the very best quality&quot;. It also stated that &quot;an unusual amount of decorative taste has been displayed&quot; in the station's construction; even the viaduct was praised as &quot;one of the most ornamental pieces of work we have ever seen attempted on a railway&quot; for its fine brickwork.32 The station's design prompted the journal to write a 2,000-word editorial bemoaning the comparatively poor architectural quality of other contemporary civil engineering projects.33 An architectural critic later noted the station was &quot;eulogised&quot; by journals upon its opening and that its architecture was still seen as exemplary at the end of the 19th century.34
There were initially two platforms at the station: up and down.35 Up was accessed from the upper floor of the station building via a stairway outside the building and down from an island platform. The station's original signal box, elevated above the railway viaduct at the junction between Norwood Road and Half Moon Lane, was a prominent feature in Herne Hill for many years.36
The land for the station was compulsorily purchased from Thomas Vyse, manufacturer of straw hats and owner of the Abbey, an estate at 70 Herne Hill; the station and much of the viaduct were built on part of the Abbey's grounds.37 A new road (appropriately, Station Road) was built from the station to the junction of Norwood Road and Half Moon Lane, Herne Hill's main thoroughfare.38
On 6 October 1863, the City Branch opened from Herne Hill as far as , via  and  (the platforms at Loughborough Junction, now the closest station to Herne Hill, opened in 1872).39 The line from Beckenham Junction reached Herne Hill from the south in July 1863,40 connecting the station to the LCDR's lines in Kent, and finally allowing the LCDR to avoid using the LB&amp;SCR's tracks to access Victoria from Kent.41 By June 1864, the City Branch had been extended to Blackfriars Bridge railway station (on the south bank of the River Thames) via .42 Blackfriars Railway Bridge was then built across the Thames and a terminus for trains from the south opened at Ludgate Hill on 1 June 1865.43  Snow Hill tunnel opened on 1 January 1866, enabling trains from Herne Hill to reach Farringdon and completing the Metropolitan Extension. In 1868, the LB&amp;SCR opened a suburban line from London Bridge to Sutton via . A  extension from Tulse Hill to Herne Hill opened on 1 January 1869.44
Early services
From July 1863, the LCDR's trains between Victoria and Kent ran through Herne Hill. Passengers could travel to destinations in continental Europe via a connecting steamboat from Dover Harbour to Calais;45 these boat train services left Victoria and Ludgate Hill simultaneously and were joined at Herne Hill.46 Express journeys from Herne Hill to Dover, a distance of , took 1 hour, 36 minutes, at an average speed of .47 Services to London were split at Herne Hill to give passengers easier access to the City of London and beyond;48 the LCDR began operating direct services to King's Cross and Barnet (now High Barnet tube station) from Herne Hill when Snow Hill tunnel opened.49
A popular workmen's train (one penny per journey) ran between Ludgate Hill and Victoria via Herne Hill from 1865. Trains left from both termini at 04:55 and returned at 18:15.50 The LCDR was compelled to operate this service by Parliament to compensate for the large number of working class homes destroyed in Camberwell during the construction of the City Branch.51 Regular one-way fares to Ludgate Hill were eight pence, six pence and four pence for first, second and third class respectively (or return for one shilling, nine pence and seven pence respectively), with journey times of 15 minutes on express services and 26 minutes when calling at all stops.52
Both the Great Northern Railway (GNR) and the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) helped fund the Metropolitan Extensions (&lt;U+00A3&gt;320,000 and &lt;U+00A3&gt;310,000 respectively; &lt;U+00A3&gt; and &lt;U+00A3&gt; as of ) in return for the right to use the LCDR's tracks.53 The GNR ran trains between Hatfield and Herne Hill from August 1866 until March 1868 (when the trains were diverted to Victoria via Loughborough Junction);54 this was a busy all-stops service, with 15 trains leaving Hatfield and 14 leaving Herne Hill every day.55 The LSWR began running trains between Ludgate Hill and Wimbledon via Herne Hill when the Tulse Hill extension was completed.56 Some of these services went as far as Kingston until the mid-1890s.57
Changes from 1870 to 1923
By 1870, a track had been added to the east of the station and two sidings had been added to the west;5859 one of the western sidings was a bay platform for passenger trains, which was accessed from the platform adjoining the upper floor.60 Interlocking signalling was in use at Herne Hill by 1880.61
The LCDR enlarged the station in 1884 to meet growing demand: the viaduct was widened to allow for the construction of a second island platform and two lines to the east62 (the easternmost line was used only for freight63); and the foot tunnel under the viaduct was opened. In 1885, the LCDR decided to use Blackfriars Bridge railway station solely as a goods yard but lacked the space to sort wagons at the site.6465 It purchased  of land between Herne Hill and Loughborough Junction for this purpose.66 The Herne Hill Sorting Sidings had some 35 sidings, the longest of which was .67 A stationmaster's house was built at 239 Railton Road in the mid-1880s as the site offered a good view of the station (it is now privately owned).68 In 1888, Railton Road was extended to the Norwood Road/Half Moon Lane junction and Station Road ceased to exist.69  At the beginning of 1899, the LCDR and the neighbouring South Eastern Railway (SER) handed over operation of their services to the newly-formed South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR), which was jointly owned by the two railways. The SECR ran the trains, but the lines and stations continued to be owned by the LCDR or SER.70
In 1900, it was suggested in The Contemporary Review that the City Branch should be replaced with an electric deep-level railway (i.e. a 'tube' line) between Herne Hill and Farringdon in order to remove Blackfriars Railway Bridge, which the author considered to be a blight on the Thames.71
A late-night service from Ludgate Hill (departing 01:15) to Beckenham Junction via Herne Hill began in 1910. The intention was to satisfy journalists on Fleet Street who regularly complained in print about the poor quality of service on the line; those working on the morning papers often worked beyond midnight and missed the last train.72
Services to Farringdon from Herne Hill were discontinued in 1916 with the closure of Snow Hill tunnel to passengers, and trains from the south terminated at Holborn Viaduct instead.7374 The LCDR amalgamated with the LB&amp;SCR, SER and several other railways to form the Southern Railway at the start of 1923.75
Modernisation
Work began on electrifying the former LCDR suburban routes in 1924. Herne Hill station was extensively remodelled as part of these works: the eastern island platform was lengthened; the original island platform was demolished and replaced by one further west (allowing two tracks to be laid between the island platforms); the western sidings were removed; and the upper floor was closed to passengers.7677
On 12 July 1925, a 660-volt third-rail system came into operation on both routes through Herne Hill: from Victoria to Orpington on the Chatham Main Line and along the entire length of the City Branch. Electric passenger services ran every 20 minutes on both routes during the day78 and electric trains were kept overnight at the sorting sidings, north of the station.79  The distinctive signal box overlooking Norwood Road and a similar signal box at the northern end of the station were demolished in 1956 and replaced by a single signal box adjacent to the north junction.80 The replacement signal box was in use from June 1956 until December 1981, when its functions were transferred to Victoria; the building still exists and is used by railway staff.81 The signalling at Herne Hill was upgraded from semaphores to colour lights on 8 March 1959 as part of the Kent Coast electrification plan.82
By 1959, the pattern of commuter services at Herne Hill had taken the shape it would hold into the 21st century: all-stop trains from Victoria to Orpington and from the City of London to Wimbledon and Sutton (but, unlike the modern Sutton Loop, via West Croydon).83 However, there was a decline in the number of electric passenger services on the Chatham Main Line through Herne Hill in the years after the war. Immediately after electrification in 1925, six trains used the route between Herne Hill and Shortlands in each direction during every off-peak hour. By 1960, it had dropped to two trains in each direction.84
The Herne Hill Sorting Sidings closed on 1 August 1966 and the freight line to the east of the station was taken out of service.85 Nothing of the sidings remains: residential accommodation has been built along Shakespeare Road (on the western sidings) and commercial premises have been built along Milkwood Road (on the eastern sidings).86 
1988 to present
In 1988, Snow Hill tunnel re-opened and the former LCDR City Branch formed the basis of the new Thameslink route. Network Rail began a major upgrade of the route in 2009. A key objective of the Thameslink Programme was allowing more trains to travel between central London and Brighton, which was prevented by a bottleneck between London Bridge and Blackfriars on a viaduct through the historic Borough Market. Network Rail initially suggested widening the viaduct and demolishing part of the market, but the public backlash against this plan prompted Network Rail to consider permanently routing all Thameslink trains to/from Brighton via Herne Hill, avoiding London Bridge and the market.87 This would have required the grade separation of the two lines through Herne Hill, which would have been achieved by constructing a new viaduct immediately to the east of the existing viaduct and using a fly-over to connect the southern end of the new viaduct to the line between Tulse Hill and North Dulwich (taking the tracks over the Chatham Main Line and towards Tulse Hill).88 This proposal was rejected in 2004 because of its environmental impact on Herne Hill and the larger number of interchanges offered on the London Bridge route; the Borough Market viaduct was widened instead.89 From December 2008 to May 2012, Thameslink services serving Herne Hill did not run most weekends or after 22:30 every week-night because of construction work on the Thameslink route through central London as part of the Thameslink Programme.90
During the initial planning in the late 1980s for High Speed 1 (HS1; a high-speed railway line between London and the Channel Tunnel), British Rail considered building the line to serve a low-level station at King's Cross via south London.91 An option for this route was via Herne Hill, which would have required quadrupling the tracks on the Chatham Main Line between Shortlands and Herne Hill and on the City Branch to Loughborough Junction;92 it was estimated that this would have led to the loss of 90&lt;U+2013&gt;180 homes in Lambeth.93 Although both a different route and London terminus for HS1 were eventually chosen (St Pancras via East London), Eurostar services linking London Waterloo to Brussels and Paris passed through Herne Hill without stopping94 from 1994 until the completion of HS1 in November 2007. This marked the end of rail services to the continent via Herne Hill, which had been started by the LCDR in 1863 when the line between Victoria and Dover via Herne Hill was completed.  The upper floor of the station, which had not been used by passengers since 1925, was converted into  of office space in 1991 and rented as 'Tower House' (after the station's distinctive tower).95 The disused freight line to the east of the station was partly reopened in 2009 as a siding for use by First Capital Connect trains to compensate for the loss of sidings when the Moorgate Thameslink branch was closed.9697 The line's connection to the south junction was severed during these works. The station had become fully accessible by 2010: lifts were installed to provide step-free access to the platforms in 200898 and a unisex disabled-accessible toilet was opened on the southbound platforms in 2010.99
Accidents and disruption
Railway services through Herne Hill were affected by World War II. Passenger services on the City Branch were reduced from September 1939 to once every 30 minutes during the week and hourly at weekends;100 and the line was cut twice during the Blitz. On the second occasion, the railway bridge over Hinton Road (immediately south of Loughborough Junction) was destroyed.101 The route between Holborn Viaduct and Herne Hill was disrupted by 62 incidents during the war.102
 On 6 November 1947, a steam train approaching from West Dulwich passed a signal at danger in heavy fog and crashed into an electric train crossing the station's south junction towards Tulse Hill. One passenger onboard the electric train was killed and nine others were hospitalised.103
A minor accident occurred on 30 June 1957. A light engine, travelling towards Tulse Hill, was waiting to cross the south junction when it was struck from behind by an express passenger service from Victoria that had passed a signal at danger. The driver of the light engine and two passengers from the express train were hospitalised but quickly discharged.104
A second fatal collision occurred at the sorting sidings, just north of the station, on 1 April 1960 in fog that reduced visibility to . A steam locomotive was waiting on the southbound track outside Herne Hill for a proceed signal when the signalman cleared an electric passenger service (behind the steam locomotive) to proceed down the same track. The steam locomotive was struck from behind, destroying it and killing the electric train's driver.105
On 8 May 2004, there was a security alert at the station after a train driver reported seeing a man in camouflage gear with a rocket launcher on a platform. In fact, the man was a local busker carrying a didgeridoo.106
Future
Services
The route through the station will be busier from 2015 as Thameslink trains serving London Bridge will be diverted via Herne Hill107 - an additional four trains per hour in both directions.108 This is due to the redevelopment of London Bridge that will temporarily close it to Bedford-Brighton trains. The additional trains will not call at Herne Hill; instead, they will run fast between London Blackfriars and East Croydon.109 It would not be possible for the 12-car peak services to call at Herne Hill in any event as the station's platforms are too short and it would not be viable to use selective door operation as the carriages not on the platforms would foul the junctions.110 
Network Rail, in its July 2011 London &amp; South East route utilisation strategy, has recommended that all services from Herne Hill towards Blackfriars should terminate in the bay platforms at Blackfriars after London Bridge's redevelopment is completed in 2018111 and the diverted Thameslink trains return there.112 Passengers from Herne Hill would then have to change at Blackfriars to travel further north. Network Rail has made this recommendation because more services will be using the route between St. Pancras and London Bridge from 2018;113 sending trains from Herne Hill to the terminating platforms on the western side of Blackfriars (instead of the through tracks on the eastern side of the station) will remove the need for them to cross in front of trains to/from Denmark Hill and trains to/from London Bridge at junctions south of Blackfriars.114
It is anticipated there will be six trains to Blackfriars from Herne Hill during peak hours from 2018 (four from Sutton and two from Kent House) and four trains from Sutton during off-peak hours.115 There will also be two trains between Medway, Kent and Blackfriars via Herne Hill during peak hours, but they will not call at the station.116
The Department for Transport has yet to decide whether the Sutton Loop will remain part of the Thameslink service after 2018 and receive the new Thameslink trains.117 In the longer term, Network Rail has forecast that by 2031 there will be 900 more passengers attempting to travel on the route between Herne Hill and Blackfriars during the busiest peak hour every weekday than can be accommodated on the trains.118 It is anticipated that eight-car trains with higher capacity (similar to the Class 378 trains used on inner London metro routes) will eventually be required to address this shortfall.119
Station infrastructure
 The route from Victoria to Orpington via Herne Hill is projected to be amongst the most congested and overcrowded in South East London by 2026.120 Network Rail is considering grade-separating the two lines passing through Herne Hill so that trains would not cross each other's paths at the station's junctions;121 this restricts the number of services that can pass through the station. A 2008 route utilisation strategy for South London concluded that this improvement will not be required before 2020 but recommended safeguarding the required land.122 Grade-separation is supported by Southeastern123 and First Capital Connect believes it should be given more consideration,124 but Network Rail has stated that it would be difficult to carry out the work because the station is on a viaduct and surrounded by buildings.125 The 2011 route utilisation strategy, which examined options for congestion relief at Herne Hill before 2031, did not suggest grade-separation as an option in the 2011&lt;U+2013&gt;2031 period.126127
This project would also enable the platforms at Herne Hill to be lengthened to accommodate 12-car trains as the current northern junction, which prevents them from being extended, would be removed.128 However, longer trains could not be used on the Sutton Loop without also rebuilding Tulse Hill and Elephant &amp; Castle.129
The congestion within the station itself has been noted by Network Rail and it is keeping the situation under review.130 Transport for London (TfL) has recommended that specific improvement works (new entrance doors, removal of interior wall, wider stairs to platforms and second station entrance) be carried out between 2014 and 2019.131
TfL has also suggested there may be potential for the turnaround siding adjacent to Milkwood Road to be converted for passenger use.132 This would require substantial changes to the station as there is no direct access to the platforms from Milkwood Road and the current corridor for accessing the platforms does not extend any further east than the southbound platform.133
Incorporation into London Overground
The Mayor of London published a long-term vision for the London Overground in February 2012.134 It recommends that all London suburban rail services should eventually be devolved to TfL and that suburban services currently provided by Southeastern be devolved by 2020 to demonstrate the benefits of this approach.135 Southeastern's suburban services include the route between Victoria and Orpington via Herne Hill.136
Victoria line extension
TfL has considered extending the Victoria line to Herne Hill to provide faster turnaround at the southern end of the line. The extension is not a priority for TfL as it has a weaker business case than other infrastructure projects.137
Service pattern
 The station is managed by Southeastern train operating company. The off-peak service pattern  is:

Two trains per hour (tph) to  via 138
2 tph to  via Elephant &amp; Castle139
4 tph to London Victoria via 140
4 tph to  via Beckenham Junction141
2 tph to Sutton via Wimbledon142
2 tph to Sutton via 143

On Sunday, northbound Sutton Loop trains alternate between terminating at Blackfriars and Luton.144 Late-night Sutton Loop services (21:57 onwards) run to  from Monday-Saturday and terminate at Blackfriars on Sunday.145
First Capital Connect and Southeastern jointly operate additional peak services from Herne Hill to Beford (morning and evening peaks),146 Beckenham Junction, ,  and  (evening peak only).147




Transport links
Herne Hill is served by London bus routes 3, 37 (24 hours), 68, 196, 201, 322, 468, school route 690 and night buses N3 and N68. The nearest London Underground station is Brixton.148
