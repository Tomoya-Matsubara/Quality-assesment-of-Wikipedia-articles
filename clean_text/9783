&quot;Cry Me a River&quot; is a song recorded by American recording artist Justin Timberlake for his 2002 debut studio album Justified. It was written by Timberlake, Scott Storch and producer Timbaland, and was inspired by Timberlake's former relationship with pop singer Britney Spears. Jive Records released the single to contemporary hit and rhythmic radio in the United States on November 24, 2002, as the album's second single. Accompanied by clavinet, beatbox, guitars, synthesizers, Arabian-inspired riffs and Gregorian chants, &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; is a funk and R&amp;B song about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past.
The single received generally positive reviews from critics, who considered it a stand-out track on Justified and praised Timbaland's production. It won a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 2004 ceremony. The song peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 and Pop Songs charts and charted in the top ten in other countries. It was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and silver by the Syndicat National de l'&lt;U+00C9&gt;dition Phonographique (SNEP).
Filmmaker Francis Lawrence directed the music video for &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; in Malibu, California. In the video, Timberlake's character spies on his ex-lover and shows her the love for his new partner. Spears alleged that the video was a publicity stunt, but Timberlake maintained that she did not inspire the production. The clip won the awards for Best Male Video and Best Pop Video at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. Timberlake performed &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; on his three major concert tours: Justified World Tour (2003&lt;U+2013&gt;04), Justified/Stripped Tour (2003) and FutureSex/LoveShow (2007). The song has been covered by various recording artists, including Leona Lewis and Taylor Swift. Spears recorded an answer song titled &quot;Everytime&quot; for her 2003 studio album In the Zone.
Writing and production

Timberlake admitted in December 2011 that the inspiration for &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; was his ended relationship with Britney Spears.

Timberlake and Scott Storch wrote &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; with Timbaland, who produced the song.1 Storch found working with Timberlake easy because of the song's meaning.2 Reporters believed its lyrics were inspired by Timberlake's romantic relationship with American recording artist Britney Spears,3 which ended in 2002.4 In an interview for MTV News, Timberlake said, &quot;I'm not going to specifically say if any song is about anybody. I will say writing a couple of songs on the record helped me deal with a couple of things. To me songs are songs. They can stem from things that completely happened to you personally or they can stem from ideas that you think could happen to you.&quot;5 In December 2011, Timberlake admitted that he had written &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; after an argument with Spears: &quot;I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call. I walked into the studio and he [Timbaland] could tell I was visibly angry.&quot;6 Timbaland recalled, &quot;I was like, 'Man, don't worry about it' and he was like, 'I can't believe she did that to me' and he was like, 'You were my sun, you were my earth'&quot;.7
&quot;Cry Me a River&quot; was recorded at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles by Senator Jimmy D, while Carlos &quot;Storm&quot; Martinez served as the assistant engineer.8 Jimmy Douglass and Timbaland mixed the song at Manhattan Center Studios in New York City.9 Timberlake arranged the vocals and was a backup singer alongside Timbaland, Marsha Ambrosius, Tyrone Tribbett and Greater Anointing.10 Storch compared Timberlake's vocals on &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; to R&amp;B and rock singer Daryl Hall.11 Larry Gold provided the string arrangement and conducting, while Storch and Bill Pettaway played the clavinet and guitar, respectively.12
Release and response
&quot;Cry Me a River&quot; was released as the second single from Justified.13 Jive Records serviced the song to contemporary and rhythmic radio in the United States on November 24, 2002.1415 On December 23, three remixes were released as a 12-inch single in Canada and France.1617 On January 5, 2003, the song was sent to urban contemporary radio stations in the US.18 It was released as a CD single in Germany on January 23.

The single features the album version of the song, its instrumental and four remixes.22
Following its release, there was media speculation that Spears had written a song as a response to &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;;23 she denied the rumors, explaining, &quot;You know, it's funny. I read that I wrote this song and I wrote these lyrics and that's not my style. I would never do that.&quot;24 Annet Artani, who co-wrote Spears' 2003 song &quot;Everytime&quot;, stated that the song was written as a response to &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;.25 When asked during an interview with Diane Sawyer on PrimeTime in 2009, if &quot;Everytime&quot; was about Timberlake, Spears responded, &quot;I'll let the song speak for itself.&quot;26
Composition and lyrical interpretation

&quot;Cry Me a River&quot; is a funk27 and R&amp;B song28 with an instrumentation that features clavinet, guitars,2930 beatboxing,31 synthesizers, Arabian-inspired riffs and Gregorian chants.32 The instruments are arranged into what critics described as a graceful and mysterious melody.33 Jane Stevenson of Jam! said the single combines gospel and opera.34 Tyler Martin of Stylus Magazine enjoyed the way that the song unconventionally mixed a range of experimental sounds.35 According to Martin, the wave synth affects the real strings to create an unusual dissonance.36 The song's chorus devolves into a choral reading in which Timberlake pleads over the group. &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; finishes with a Timbaland vocal sample.37
&quot;Cry Me a River&quot; is written in the key of B major, in common time, with a tempo of 74Â beats per minute. 38 Timberlake's vocal range spans from C&lt;U+266F&gt;4 to B5.39 Billboard magazine critics called &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; a bittersweet song, in which Timberlake's &quot;familiar tenor belting&quot; is tempered with a soulful falsetto and a &quot;convincingly aggressive rock-spiked baritone&quot; rasp.40 David Browne of Entertainment Weekly labeled the song &quot;a haunted, pained farewell&quot;.41
Lyrically, the song is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past.42 A Rolling Stone reviewer called the song a &quot;breakup aria&quot;.43 According to Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; stands out for its &quot;slow-building sense of drama&quot;, which highlights Timberlake at his &quot;husky best&quot;.44 The song begins with the phrase &quot;You were my sun, you were my earth&quot;, which according to Timbaland was Timberlake's inspiration to write the song.4546 Tanya L. Edwards of MTV News observed that Timberlake was wronged and said this is demonstrated by the lyrics: &quot;You don't have to say whatcha did / I already know, I found out from him / Now there's just no chance.&quot;47 The chorus contains the lines: &quot;Told me you loved me, why did you leave me all alone / Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone.&quot;48 Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani called Timberlake's 2007 single &quot;What Goes Around... Comes Around&quot; an ostensible sequel to &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; both lyrically and musically.49 Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated that aside from the presence of Timbaland's &quot;fantastically cluttered production&quot;, the difference between &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; and Timberlake's 2013 single &quot;Mirrors&quot; is clear: &quot;10 years ago, Timberlake was broken, and now he is whole&quot;.50
Reception and accolades

&quot;Cry Me a River&quot; earned Timberlake a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards.

&quot;Cry Me a River&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. Jane Stevenson of Jam! and Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine regarded it as a stand-out track from Justified.5152 Similar to Cinquemani, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic selected the song as a highlight in his review of Justified.53 Peter Robinson of NME called it a &quot;twisted epic&quot; and &quot;an acidic, filthy little song teeming with spite and retribution, with Timbaland's pounding.&quot;54
Denise Boyd of BBC Music felt that the song's lyrics play as large a role as Timbaland's production, unlike other songs on Justified.55 Rolling Stone{{'}}s Ben Ratliff also viewed his production of &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; as exceptional.56 David Browne of Entertainment Weekly concluded that the song is &quot;a genuine stunner&quot; that should leave Timberlake's fellow 'N Syncers concerned that he truly may not need them anymore.57 John Mitchell of MTV News called &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; and &quot;What Goes Around... Comes Around&quot; &quot;kiss-off songs&quot;, with Timberlake's revenge to Spears present throughout the lyrics.58
Rolling Stone ranked &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; at number 20 on their list of the 100 Best Songs of the 2000s; a columnist for the magazine wrote that the real inspiration behind the song was the formation of the Timberlake&lt;U+2013&gt;Timbaland team, &quot;a match made in pop heaven&quot;.59 In 2012, the magazine placed it at number 484 on their list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.60 VH1 ranked &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; at number 59 on their list of the 100 Greatest Songs of the 2000s.61 The single won a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 2004 award ceremony.62 It was nominated for Song of the Year at the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards,63 but lost to Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; Knowles' &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;.64

Music video
Development and synopsis
The music video for &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; was directed by Francis Lawrence in Malibu, California, during the week of October 29, 2002.89 Lawrence created the video's concept and told MTV News, &quot;[Me and Justin] had a conversation on the phone and all he said was he wanted to have some dancing in it, but to do my thing. He told me what the song was about, but in a [general way] as well. He just said it was a kiss-off song and so I came up with this idea and he went for it&quot;.90 Lawrence added that he also included some details in the video, including a reference to Spears's tattoo, which Timberlake enjoyed. He explained that he and Timberlake did not mention names while creating the video, only discussing the song's general beats.91 Lawrence also revealed that executives of Jive Records were nervous about some aspects of the video, such as Timberlake's representation of a voyeur and the tone of some scenes he was portraying with a girl. &quot;That's the thing I liked most about this project, was that he was coming into it with a super clean-cut image with 'N Sync and he's such a nice guy and so handsome and what I was into doing was making him be a bit scary. Lurking around the house in the rain, throwing a rock through her window, being a peeping Tom, getting revenge and doing stuff that's not really what a nice guy does.&quot;92 The music video for &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; was released onto the iTunes Store on April 28, 2003.93
 The video begins with a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears94), walking out of her house hand-in-hand with an unidentified man.95 The couple leaves in the woman's car as Timberlake rolls down the window of a silver Porsche, from which he and his friend have been watching the woman.96 Timberlake breaks into the house by throwing a rock through a window and proceeds through the woman's house, with anti-gravity jumps and slides, not causing any other visible damage, except for kicking a picture frame of the woman across the living room.97 Then he searches some drawers and finds a video camera, while the driver of the car, Timbaland, signals for his female accomplice in the back of the car, played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.
Reception
Peter Robinson of NME wrote that the video shows &quot;what Justin looks like after he's had sex. Clue: he looks pretty good.&quot;98 According to Virginia Heffernan of The New York Times, Timberlake channels the character Neo from The Matrix film series, &quot;pacing anxiously around wet and metallic interiors&quot;.99 At the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, the video for &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; won in the categories of Best Male Video and Best Pop Video.100 It had also been nominated for Video of the Year, Best Direction in a Video and Viewer's Choice.101
Following the release of the music video, Us Weekly ran a cover story titled Britney Vs. Justin: The War Is On. Timberlake denied that Spears inspired the video, saying, &quot;The video is not about her. The video is about me.&quot;102 However, Spears told Rolling Stone in October 2003 that she received a call from Timberlake saying he wanted to get back together with her and that she was in a music video with him. She states that he reassured her by saying, &quot;Don't worry about it. It's not a big deal&quot;.103 Spears, who had not seen the video, says she allowed him to do so but became infuriated after watching it. She recalled that she when she asked why he had made a video about her, he replied, &quot;Well, I got a controversial video.&quot;104 She stated that it was a great publicity stunt, commenting, &quot;So he got what he wanted. I think it looks like such a desperate attempt, personally.&quot;105 After the release of Spears' video for &quot;Toxic&quot; (2003), Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News said her video &quot;[made] &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; look like child's play&quot;.106
