William Jennings Jefferson (born March 14, 1947) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Louisiana. A Democrat, Jefferson has been a member of the U.S. House of Representatives since 1991. He represents , which includes much of the greater New Orleans area. He is Louisiana's first black Congressman since the end of Reconstruction.1 He is currently the subject of a corruption probe, and in May 2006 his Congressional offices were raided, as well as his home in Northeast Washington, where, the FBI alleged, they &quot;found $90,000 of the cash in the freezer, in $10,000 increments wrapped in aluminum foil and stuffed inside frozen-food containers.&quot;
In the midterm election on November 7, 2006, Jefferson received 30% of the vote against several opponents, and then proceeded to win in a runoff election against Louisiana State Representative Karen Carter on December 9, 2006.
Early life and career
Jefferson was born in Lake Providence, a small town in East Carroll Parish in far northeastern Louisiana, where he and his eight brothers and sisters worked alongside their father, who was a sharecropper and a heavy-equipment operator for the Army Corps of Engineers.
Though neither of his parents had graduated from high school, Jefferson graduated from G.W. Griffin High School in Lake Providence and received a bachelor's degree from Southern University, where in 1969 he led a protest against substandard campus facilities and negotiated with then-Governor John McKeithen. He later earned a law degree from Harvard University in 1972. After graduation, he became a law clerk for Judge Alvin B. Rubin of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana from 1972 to 1973, and a lawyer with a private practice. From 1973 to 1975, he was a legislative assistant to U.S. Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Jr., of Louisiana. He moved to New Orleans in 1976 and was elected as a member of the Louisiana Senate in 1980, where he served until 1991. He twice unsuccessfully ran for New Orleans mayor, first challenging Ernest N. Morial in the election of 1982, and then being defeated by Sidney Barthelemy in the mayoral runoff of 1986.2 In 1990 William Jefferson was elected to the House, becoming the first black member of Congress from Louisiana since Reconstruction. In the House, Jefferson joined the Congressional Black Caucus.3
Local influence
Jefferson and his family control one of the most sophisticated and effective get-out-the-vote organizations in South Louisiana: the Progressive Democrats. In 2002, their political machine helped Jefferson's prot&lt;U+00E9&gt;g&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Gill Pratt being elected as a Councilmember, even though it was unable to ensure that Jefferson's daughter Jalila would succeed Pratt as a Representative to the Louisiana State House. It also contributed to the election of Jefferson's sister Betty as a municipal assessor, in 1998, 2002 and 2006.
In recent years, New Orleans-based political machines in general have lost clout. This trend has accelerated since thousands of New Orleanians were scattered across the United States, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The influence of the Progressive Democrats in particular may be compromised even more by the current corruption investigation that affects Jefferson.
Actions following Hurricane Katrina
Jefferson has received criticism for his actions in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Five days after the hurricane made landfall, Jefferson utilized a National Guard detachment to recover personal effects and belongings from his home.4 After the truck in which he and the detachment traveled became stuck, further National Guard resources were expended (amidst ongoing search and rescue operations) to aid the original detachment, including a second truck and helicopter.
Corruption investigation
Jefferson has been under investigation by the FBI for suspected corruption since March 2005. Since that time, he has been named in the guilty pleas of two associates. On 15 May 2006, Jefferson called a press conference at which he announced that he did not intend to resign, despite expecting to be indicted on corruption charges. On 20 May 2006, Jefferson's Congressional offices were searched by the FBI, &quot;believed to be the first-ever FBI raid on a Congressional office,&quot;5 raising concerns that it could &quot;set a dangerous precedent that could be used by future administrations to intimidate or harass a supposedly coequal branch of the government.&quot;6 See below.
An investigation of Jefferson by various agencies began in mid-2005, after an investor came to authorities. Jefferson is alleged to have received over $400,000 in bribes through a company maintained in the name of his spouse and children. The money came from a tech company named iGate, Inc. of Louisville, Kentucky, and in return, it is alleged, Jefferson would help iGate's business. Jefferson was to persuade the U.S. Army to test iGate's broadband two-way technology and other iGate products; use his efforts to influence, possibly through bribery, high-ranking officials in Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon; and meet with personnel of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, in order to facilitate potential financing for iGate business deals in those countries.7
FBI investigation of bribery and fraud
On 30 July 2005, Jefferson was videotaped by the FBI allegedly receiving $100,000 worth of 100 dollar bills in a leather briefcase at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Arlington, Virginia.8 Jefferson told an investor, Lori Mody, who was wearing a wire, that he would need to give Nigerian Vice President Atiku Abubakar $500,000 &quot;as a motivating factor&quot; to make sure they obtained contracts for iGate and Mody's company in Nigeria.9 A few days later, on 3 August 2005, FBI agents raided Jefferson's home in Northeast Washington and, as noted in an 83-page affidavit filed to support a subsequent raid on his Congressional office, &quot;found $90,000 of the cash in the freezer, in $10,000 increments wrapped in aluminum foil and stuffed inside frozen-food containers.&quot; Serial numbers found on the currency in the freezer matched serial numbers of funds given by the FBI to their informant.
Late in the night of 20 May 2006, FBI agents executed a search warrant10 at Jefferson's office in the Rayburn House Office Building.
The affidavit used to support these raids included, among other allegations:

The FBI videotaped Jefferson receiving a stock certificate from Mody for a company set up in Nigeria to promote iGate's technology. Jefferson predicted the deal would generate $200 million annually after five years.
Jefferson told Mody that he wanted a similar financial stake in the business in Ghana.
Jefferson sought $10 million in financing from Mody to take over iGate and install &quot;confidants&quot; on the new board. In two payments, Mody wired $89,225 to the ANJ Group LLC, a company controlled by Jefferson's family.
Jefferson lent $4,800 of the money Mody gave him to an unnamed congressional aide. Another $4,900 was given back to the FBI by one of Jefferson's attorneys.
The FBI claims it has uncovered &quot;at least seven other schemes in which Jefferson sought things of value in return for his official acts.&quot;11

Former aides plead guilty
In January 2006, Brett M. Pfeffer, a former aide to Jefferson, implicated him in a corruption scheme involving an Internet company being set up in Nigeria. Pfeffer was president of an investment company in McLean, Virginia. In return for political support for the deal, Jefferson had legal work directed toward his family's operations. It was also said that a daughter of his was put on retainer of the Virginia investment company to the tune of $5,000 a month. Jefferson also is said to have arranged for his family a 5% to 7% ownership stake in the Nigerian Internet company. Pfeffer pled guilty to charges of aiding and abetting bribery of a public official and conspiracy on 11 January 2006 in a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia.12 On May 26, he was sentenced to eight years, but was &quot;cooperating in an ongoing probe and may be eligible for a sentence reduction afterward&quot;, according to a prosecutor.13
On 3 May 2006 Vernon Jackson, 53, CEO of Louisville, Kentucky based iGate Inc., admitted to bribery of a public official and conspiracy to bribe a public official during a plea hearing in U.S. District Court. According to the Associated Press, &quot;court documents make clear that Congressman William Jefferson (Democrat-Louisiana) is the accused congressman, without naming him.&quot; Jackson's plea bargain requires his cooperation in the ongoing investigation against the congressman he admits bribing. The total amount of the bribes is between $400,000 and $1 million, according to court documents of the Jackson proceeding.14 On September 8th, Jackson was sentenced to 7 years &amp; 3 months in jail.15
Congressional office raid
The May 20 raid of Jefferson's office in Room 2113 of the Rayburn House Office Building set off a series of political events. Jefferson immediately challenged the action in federal court, and members of the House generally reacted strongly against the raid. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued &quot;a rare joint statement demanding that the FBI return the documents and saying that Jefferson then should cooperate more fully with the investigation.&quot;16 &quot;Many Republicans and Democrats contend that the unprecedented raid on a congressional office was unduly aggressive and may have breached the constitutional separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches of government that are meant to shelter lawmakers from administrative intimidation.&quot;17 Tensions escalated to the point where, according to AP, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, his deputy, Paul McNulty, and possibly FBI Director Robert Mueller &quot;were said to be ready to quit if the Justice Department was asked to return the Jefferson documents...[while the] House was threatening to go after the Justice Department's budget.&quot;18
On May 25, President Bush stepped in, taking the extraordinary step of &quot;directing the Department of Justice to seal all the materials recovered from Congressman William Jefferson's (Democrat-Louisiana) office for the next 45 days and not to allow access to anyone involved in the investigation.&quot;19
While members of the Senate seemed to take a more measured view of the raid,20 on 30 May 2006, Representative James Sensenbrenner, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee began to hold hearings, called &quot;Reckless Justice: Did the Saturday Night Raid of Congress Trample the Constitution?&quot;, on the &quot;profoundly disturbing&quot; questions that he said the Justice Department's actions have raised.
The FBI, in answering Jefferson's complaint of the raid, attached an FBI agent's affidavit claiming that the raid was necessary because while the FBI was searching his home in August, Jefferson tried to &quot;surreptitiously remove&quot; documents.21
An ABC News poll released 1 June 2006 found 86% of Americans supported the FBI's right to search congressional offices when they obtain a warrant.22
On July 10, 2006, Chief Judge Thomas F. Hogan for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, ruled the FBI raid on Jefferson's office was legal,23 rejecting his and the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the Unites States House of Representatives claim that the search violated the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause, separation of powers principle and Fourth Amendment. Chief Judge Hogan, in a 28-page ruling, acknowledged that the &quot;facts and questions of law presented here are indeed unprecedented,&quot; but wrote that it is &quot;well-established&quot; that a Congressman is &quot;generally bound to the operation of the criminal laws as are ordinary persons,&quot; and the Speech or Debate Clause does not &quot;make Members of Congress super-citizens, immune from criminal responsibility.'&quot;24 Hogan, in his conclusion, wrote:


&quot;The existing broad protections of the Speech or Debate Clause &lt;U+2013&gt; absolute immunity from prosecution or suit for legislative acts and freedom from being 'questioned' about those acts (including privilege from the testimonial act of producing documents in response to a subpoena) &lt;U+2013&gt; satisfy the fundamental purpose of the Clause to protect the independence of the legislature. The Court declines to extend those protections further, holding that the Speech or Debate Clause does not shield Members of Congress from the execution of valid search warrants. Congressman Jefferson's interpretation of the Speech or Debate privilege would have the effect of converting every congressional office into a taxpayer-subsidized sanctuary for crime. Such a result is not supported by the Constitution or judicial precedent and will not be adopted here. See Williamson v. United States, 28 S. Ct. at 167 ('[T]he laws of this country allow no place or employment as a sanctuary for crime.') (quotation omitted).25


However, later that same month, a three-judge appellate panel unanimously overruled Hogan's decision and affirmed that the Department of Justice could not review Rep. Jefferson's files until he had seen what files were taken and which of those pertained to his work as a legislator. The appellate court directed that Hogan, the judge who originally authorized the controversial search and seizure, should determine if Jefferson's claims of legislative privilege extend to specific seized files that the lawmaker may cite. Jefferson was not charged with any crime at the close of July of 2006.26
Stripped of committee membership
On May 24, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi publicly requested his immediate resignation from the House Ways and Means Committee; he declined to do so.27 Although Mel Watt, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus declared the strong support of the caucus for Jefferson it has since been reported that two prominent members of the caucus, John Lewis (D-Ga.) and Charles B. Rangel (D-NY) have played a major role in the campaign to force Jefferson to step down.28
On 15 June 2006, House Democrats voted to strip Jefferson of his committee assignment while the federal bribery investigation continues. Members approved the move after Jefferson repeatedly refused to step aside. Despite claims of the Congressional Black Caucus that Jefferson was being treated unfairly, the vote passed 99-58. Some have reported that the vote was passed as a result of Democrats who are determined to make an election-year point about ethics. The full House, which is the only group with the power to actually remove Jefferson, then stripped him of his seat on the committee on June 16th in a voice vote without debate. Jefferson had offered to step aside temporarily if the Democratic caucus established a rule concerning cases like his and if his seat went to Rep. Charlie Melancon (D-LA). This offer was rejected by House Democratic leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi.29
2006 Election
Main article: Louisiana House elections, 2006
Because he is excluded from the House Committee on Ways and Means, Jefferson has a significantly reduced influence in Washington, D.C. and faced an uphill battle to keep his seat in Congress, during the 2006 U.S. Midterm Election. Eight Democrats, three Republicans and one Libertarian candidate ran against him. 30
A significant amount of the district&lt;U+2019&gt;s voters were still scattered across the United States as a result of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Many of them were Black and supported the Democrats. Nonetheless, the district remained heavily Democratic and Democratic candidates fared better.
None of the candidates obtained more than 50% of the vote on the first ballot (November 7, 2006) and, therefore, a second ballot was necessary. The two candidates who survived the first ballot were both Black Democrats: Jefferson, who got 30% of the vote, and Louisiana State Representative Karen Carter, who enjoyed support from the Louisiana Democratic Party&lt;U+2019&gt;s establishment, picked up nearly all endorsements from local politicians and the local press and gathered 22% of the vote. 31
Political commentators predicted an easy victory for Karen Carter on the second ballot (to be held on December 9, 2006). 32
In the last week of campaign however, Sheriff Harry Lee, a law and order Democrat who wields tremendous influence in suburban Jefferson Parish, urged voters not to vote for Karen Carter. 33
In response to Carter's criticism of Gretna police officers and Jefferson Parish deputies, who blocked the Crescent City Connection and prevented evacuees from fleeing the city of New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Lee mailed out 25,000 flyers and made public statements attacking Carter.
Lee&lt;U+2019&gt;s efforts to defeat Carter were successful. White voters from Jefferson Parish, a group that had not shown much enthusiasm for Bill Jefferson&lt;U+2019&gt;s reelection on the first ballot, stayed home rather than vote against him. Voter turnout dwindled from 24.15% to 16.25%. While residents of the city of New Orleans gave Bill Jefferson a slight majority over Karen Carter (51% to 49%), the portion of the district that is located in Jefferson Parish (71% to 29%) clearly swung the election in his favor.
Following Bill Jefferson's reelection, Speaker-elect Nancy Pelosi announced that he will be excluded from the House Committee on Ways and Means as long as he is not &quot;cleared of wrongdoing in an ongoing federal corruption probe&quot;. 34
Nickname
In the wake of the corruption investigation, the New Orleans media often refers to the congressman as Dollar Bill Jefferson. According to Conservative political commentator Jeff Crouere, he &quot;received his unflattering nickname from the late Ernest &lt;U+201C&gt;Dutch&lt;U+201D&gt; Morial.&quot; 35 It seems that &quot;Morial had asked his prot&lt;U+00E9&gt;g&lt;U+00E9&gt; for some legal work and was given it &lt;U+2014&gt; along with a staggering bill. Outraged, Morial coined the nickname.&quot;36
The magazine Rolling Stone listed him as one of the ten worst congressmen and gave him the nickname &quot;Bribe Taker&quot; 1.
