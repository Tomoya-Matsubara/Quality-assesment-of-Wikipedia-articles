Satanicide is a New York, United States-based mock metal/glam metal12 band formed in 1999 that styles itself and its music to represent, tongue-in-cheek,3 the heavy metal music scene of the 1980s in New Jersey.45 Self described as portraying a lifestyle &quot;where the mullet and kick-ass rock 'n' roll still live,&quot; the members sport big hair and spandex and leather stagewear.6 They play party anthems and earnest power ballads with a mixture of satire and affection.7
In 2003, the New York Times identified Satanicide as the greatest mock metal band.8 In that same year, the group were described in The Drama Review as an &quot;irreverent, demonic death-metal turned glam turned cock-rock band&quot;.9 The original four member band consists of frontman Dale &quot;Devlin Mayhem&quot; May, guitarist Phil &quot;Aleister Cradley&quot; Costello, drummer Andrew &quot;Sloth Vader&quot; Griffiths, and bassist Pemberton &quot;The Baron Klaus Von Goaten&quot; Roach.10 Pemberton was replaced by bassist Sebastian &quot;Vargas Von Goaten&quot; in 2003.11
History
In the late 1990s, Dale May and Phil Costello (a real estate lawyer)12 were in a group called Peanut 23.13 Peanut 23s quirky original songs were far from successful.14 One night, both May and Costello put on their girlfriends' wigs and spent the evening &quot;acting like a couple of kids in from Jersey, kicking over trash cans, talking the talk.&quot;15 After a positive reception that night to an uninvited, impromptu performance on a club's stage, May and Costello decided to form their own band.16 Guitarist Andrew Griffiths was recruited from a trip hop band called Puracane and bassist Pemberton Roach was added to complete Satanicide.17
In August 1999, Satanicide played the famed Maxwell's music club in Hoboken, New Jersey.18 Previously used to getting maybe 30 people to come out for a Peanut 23 show, Satanicide brought in hundreds.19 In January 2003, Satanicide played a gig at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival in support of a short film made by the band.20
By March 2003, Satanicide was a popular act on the New York music scene.21 Their irreverent, demonic death metal music evoke a certain mood that was supported by a humorous stage show with improvised audience embellishment.22 The William Morris Agency agreed to represent Satanicide and worked with the band to produce a film treatment for a television series.23 However, May and Costello's songwriting chemistry did not translate into scriptwriting chemistry and the treatment was tabled.24
Four years after they formed, Satanicide sought to replace bassist Pemberton Roach in August 2003 because Roach &quot;secretly liked Billy Joel.&quot;2526 In advertising for the bassist position, Satanicide listed the required qualifications as musical &quot;chops&quot;; &quot;hott[sic] girlfriend to share with band&quot;; &quot;disposable income to buy coke, booze and whores&quot;; and &quot;when hearing the Dave Matthews Band, must be overcome by impulsive desire to kill.&quot;27 Sebastian &quot;Vargas Von Goaten&quot; replaced Pemberton in 2003.28
In September 2004, the website heatherband.com was created.29 In December 2004, Satanicide announced that it changed its name to Heather, the band, listing heatherband.com as their website.30 In addition, the group became &quot;the group formerly known as Satanicide&quot; and got rid of the big-hair wigs and at least some of the shtick.31 In July 2005, Satanicide announced that it was getting together for a reunion performance at the Bowery Ballroom, a music venue in the Bowery section of New York City.32 Some question whether they in fact broke up in the first place.33
By May 2005, Satanicide had appeared in a Cingular commercial and were headlining at the Bowery Ballroom.34 In April 2007, the Chinese gangsta rapper trio Notorious MSG released their Lunch Money EP, with Satanicide's guitarist Phil &quot;Aleister Cradley&quot; Costello providing the guitar music to the Warlord song.35 As of June 2008, Costello additionally was with the band Tragedy, described as a heavy metal Bee Gees tribute act where Costello played the Barry Glibb (sic) character.36
Presentation
A Satanicide show is an unpredictable event that is a bit dangerous and above all funny.37 In their act, the band members hurl themselves into the crown to scatter their fans like bowling pins as a way of mocking the rocker practice of stage diving/crowd surfing.38 They wear Barbie wigs to give them the big hair appearance of a glam metal rocker.39 In addition to this New York-based band claiming that they are from &quot;Jer-Z,&quot; they spout elaborate lies related to cheap-sex conquests and call to mind This Is Spinal Tap, the 1984 mockumentary directed by Rob Reiner about a dreadful metal band becoming famous.40 The Satanicide members typically wear sleeveless T-shirts and circulation-inhibiting leather pants while they convincingly mimic many styles of metal.41 Their act calls to mind a mixture of Probot, Tenacious D, The Darkness, The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years, The Upper Crust, and This Is Spinal Tap.42
