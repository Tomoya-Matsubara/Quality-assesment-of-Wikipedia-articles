Great Expectations is a 1974 film made for television based on the Charles Dickens novel of the same name. It was directed by Joseph Hardy, with screenwriter Sherman Yellen and music by Maurice Jarre, starring Michael York as Pip and Sarah Miles as Estella. The film, made for US television but released to cinemas in the UK, broke with tradition by having the same actress play both the younger and older Estella. Simon Gipps-Kent played the young Pip and the film also starred James Mason as Magwitch and Margaret Leighton as Miss Havisham, as well as Robert Morley; Joss Ackland; Rachel Roberts; Andrew Ray; Anthony Quayle and Heather Sears. It was filmed in Eastmancolor.
