The United States Air Force's 1st Space Launch Squadron (1 SLS)1 was a space launch unit located at Patrick AFB, Florida. It was responsible for USAF Delta II launches from its activation in October 1990 to its inactivation in August 2009.
History
Air Force launch operations were transferred from Air Force Systems Command to Air Force Space Command in the early 1990s. Phase I of the Launch Transfer Plan began on 1 October 1990, with the elimination of the Eastern and Western Space and Missile Centers, and the creation of the 30th Space Wing and the 45th Space Wing.2
The 1st SLS was activated on 1 October 1990 and became Air Force Space Command's first Delta II launch squadron.3 It was inactivated on 18 August 2009, following the final USAF launch of a Delta II which had occurred the previous day. Its final launch successfully placed the USA-206, or GPS IIR-21(M) navigation satellite into orbit.4
