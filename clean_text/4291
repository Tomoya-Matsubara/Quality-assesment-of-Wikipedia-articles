Timothy Shallice is a professor of neuropsychology and past director of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, part of University College London. He has been a professor at Cognitive Neuroscience Sector of SISSA since 1994.
He has been influential in laying the foundations for the discipline of cognitive neuropsychology, by formalising many of its methods and assumptions in the book From Neuropsychology to Mental Structure. He has also worked on many core problems in cognitive psychology and neuropsychology, including executive function, language and memory. Together with psychologist Donald Norman, Shallice proposed a framework of attentional control of executive functioning. One of the components of the Norman-Shallice model is the supervisory attentional system.1
Shallice has also part authored neuropsychological tests including the Hayling and Brixton tests and the Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS).
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1996. 2
