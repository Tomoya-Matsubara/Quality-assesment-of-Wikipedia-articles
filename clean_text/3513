otherships HMS Bream
HMS Bream 1804 was a Royal Navy Ballahoo class schooner Ballahoo-class schooner of 4 12-pounder carronades and a crew of 20. The prime contractor for the vessel was Goodrich & Co., in Bermuda, and she was launched in 1807.Winfield 2008, p.359. Bream operated primarily in North American waters and had an uneventful career until the War of 1812. She then captured two small American privateers and assisted in the recovery of a third, much larger one. She also captured a number of small prizes before she was sold or broken up in 1816.

Napoleonic Wars 

She was commissioned in March 1807 under Lieut. Augustus Vere Drury at City of Halifax Halifax. In April Sub-Lieutenant George Gover Miall, the commander of the schooner HMS Chebuctoo Chebuctoo, was ordered to act as Lieutenant-Commander of the Bream. Miall sailed her to the Leeward Islands.Drury was appointed to the cutter HMS Sylvia1806 Sylvia on 3 July. Miall was confirmed as a Lieutenant on 11 April 1808. While Bream was in the Chesapeake Bay a mutiny broke out that Lieut. Bartholomew George Smith Day helped suppress.
O'Bryne 1849. Miall removed to HMS Duguay-Trouin 1780 Duguay Trouin on 15 June 1809.

On 15 July 1809, Lieut. Henry Dilkes Byng took command, serving on Bream until October when Sir John Borlase Warren appointed him to command HMS Favorite 1794 Goree, then in Halifax. He was confirmed in the command on 12 December. His replacement, in January 1810, was Lieut. Robert Heriot Barclay.  
On 17 August 1810 her commander became acting Lieut. John Simpson.He was confirmed 14 December 1811.

While in Bream, Simpson carried specie to St. John's, Newfoundland and was frozen up at Louisburg, Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia Cape Breton, 
which materially harmed his health.  At some point he volunteered, with his whole crew, and joined HMS Statira 1807 Statira, under Captain Hassard Stackpoole, to cruise with her.

War of 1812
At the end of July 1812, HMS Colibri 1809 Colibri chased Bream off Cape Sable, having mistaken her for an American privateer. Phillips, Michael, Ships of the Old Navy - Bream 1807. http://www.ageofnelson.org/MichaelPhillips/info.php?ref=0387 On realizing her mistake Colibri then chased and took two other vessels, which turned out to be an American privateer and her prize.Phillips, Michael, Ships of the Old Navy - Colibri 1809. http://www.ageofnelson.org/MichaelPhillips/info.php?ref=0546

On 9 August Bream captured the American 3-gun privateer Pythagoras and her crew of 35. The capture took place off Shelburne, Nova Scotia Shelburne and took 10 minutes, during which the American suffered two men wounded.The Royal military chronicle, Vol. 4, p.476.

In October Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren dispatched HMS Shannon 1806 Shannon and Bream to rescue the crew and offload the money aboard the frigate HMS Barbadoes 1804 Barbadoes, which had been wrecked on Sable Island. They arrived on 10 October and retrieved both crew only one of whom had drowned, and the specie. Whilst carrying this out, Shannon encountered and subsequently captured an enemy privateer, which she took back to Halifax with her. Simpson left Bream in October 1812 and invalidated back to Britain in 1813.

Lieut. Constantine Brown replaced Simpson at Halifax. From late 1812 to 1813 he served in the Bay of Fundy under Capt. Alexander Gordon in HMS Rattler 1795 Rattler. In 1813 Browns replacement was Lieut. Charles Hare.

On 23 April, Bream captured the 85-ton burthen sloop Semiramis on her way to Boston from Portsmouth river.

On 19 May, Rattler, with Bream's assistance, captured the American 18-gun privateer Alexander off Kenebank Kennebunk, Maine. Rattler drove Alexander, which was returning to Salem after a 10 week cruise, on shore. Most of the crew escaped but several were drowned as they swam from her. Bream helped Rattler get Alexander off.Marshall 1823-1835, p.226.Phillips, Michael, Ships of the Old Navy - Rattler 1795. http://www.ageofnelson.org/MichaelPhillips/info.php?ref=1854

Then on 9 June, Bream and Hare captured the American privateer Wasp. The forty-ton Wasp had two 6-pounder guns and a crew of 33. Capturing her required an eight-hour running fight, including a fifty-minute battle at close quarters off Brier Island in the Bay of Fundy. Wasp's captain placed the following advertisement in the Saint John, New Brunswick, Courier of 27 June:
 A CARD - Lieut. Hare, Commander of H.M. Schooner Bream, is respectfully requested to accept the sincere thanks of Captain Ernest A. Ervin, commander of the American privateer Wasp, of Salem, for the very courteous, friendly and gentlemanlike treatment received while a prisoner on board, the deportment observed toward him being more like a friend and countryman than that of a declared enemy. - St. John, June 13, 1813.

On 12 July Bream took the schooner Jefferson, out of BOston. Two days later Bream captured the Triton bound for Kennebeck from St. Thomas's. On the same day she captured the Betsey, from Tortola and bound for Portland.

On 21 or 24 September, the Canadian privateer Dart drove the American privateer Orange, a chebacco boat of two guns and 11 men, on to Fox Island in Machias Bay on the coast of Maine.Michael Phillips' Ships of the Old Navy - Emulous 1812. http://www.ageofnelson.org/MichaelPhillips/info.php?ref=0836A chebacco was a narrow-sterned boat formerly used in the Newfoundland fisheries; also known as a pinkstern or chebec. There the boats of HMS Emulous 1812 Emulous and Bream destroyed her.Snider 1928, pp.83 & 93. 

Hares replacement was again Lieut. Constantine Brown, who remained in command until 4 February 1814 when Lieut. Thomas Beer took command in the Bay of Fundy, and served with her until he was placed on half-pay in September. 

On 27 May, Bream captured the Pilgrim.

Beer commanded Bream at the capture of Moose Island, Maine Moose Island Maine in July, and present at the attack on Battle of Baltimore Baltimore on 13 September.Allen 1850.  Bream was paid off in May 1815.

Fate
She was sold or broken up in 1816.
