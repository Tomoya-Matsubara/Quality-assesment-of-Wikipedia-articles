 A drinking song is a song sung while drinking alcohol. Most drinking songs are folk songs, and may be varied from person to person and region to region, in both the lyrics and in the music.
In Germany, drinking songs are called Trinklieder.
In Sweden, where they are called Dryckesvisor, there are drinking songs associated with Christmas, Midsummer, and other celebrations. An example of such a song is &quot;Helan g&lt;U+00E5&gt;r&quot;.
In Spain, Asturias, patria querida (the anthem of Asturias) is usually depicted as a drinking song.
History
The first record of a drinking song dates to the 11th century, and derives from the Carmina Burana,1 a 13th century historical collection of poems, educational songs, love sonnets and &quot;entertainment&quot; or drinking songs.
