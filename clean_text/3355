The Levavasseur project was an early project for a tank designed in 1903 by the French Captain Levavasseur of the 6th Artillery Battalion,1 described as a &quot;automobile cannon project&quot; (French: Projet de canon autopropulseur). It is considered as the first description, made by a soldier, of what was going to become the tank.2 Levavasseur was a graduate of Ecole Polytechnique, of the promotion of 1881 or 1882.3 According to Armoured Fighting Vehicles of the World:

Submission
The project was submitted to the French Technical Artillery Committee (Comit&lt;U+00E9&gt; G&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E9&gt;ral d'Artillerie), and after two years of study was presented to the Army Minister by the General President of the Committee. The general described the project in letter No135, dated 1 February 1905:

Construction
The locomotive mechanism is then described as a type of continuous track, supporting an armoured box with a weapon:4

Reception
The Artillery Technical Committee raised three major objections:5
1) All-terrain machines had not to that day given satisfaction.
2) Hard bodies could infiltrate in the mechanism and damage it.
3) Direction could not be properly controlled.
Overall, the need for such a machine was not felt, and horsedrawn artillery was considered as adequate.6
Aftermath
 Captain Levavasseur reworked his mechanism, improved its resistance to hard bodies and brought forward a new improved project in 1908 involving an expense of 14,000 francs for the realization of a mock-up.7
Finally the project was completely rejected by a 13 August 1908 letter explaining that a continuous tracks tractor was now available in England, the Hornsby of engineer Roberts.8
It is unclear whether General Estienne, the French &quot;Father of the tank&quot; ever knew about this project. One officer however, Commandant Ferrus, who wrote the rejection report, participated in the Schneider tank experiments on 10 September 1915,9 and became involved with the development of the Saint Chamond tank in 1916, which displays striking similarities with the Levavasseur project,10 such as several characteristics of disposition, armament (Canon de 75), motorization (80 hp engine) and general silhouette.11
Levavasseur became a Lieutenant Colonel of Artillery, and retired simply expressing his regret that his views had not been taken into consideration earlier before the advent of the World War I conflict.12
