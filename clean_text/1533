 The Qigexing Buddhist Temple Ruins (Uyghur: Xorqu, ) is a ruined compound of Buddhist religious sites located about 25&lt;U+2013&gt;30 km southwest of the town of Yanqi, Yanqi Hui Autonomous County, Xinjiang, China. The site is believed to have been a major religious center along the northern route of the Silk Road in the second half of the first millenium CE.
Names
The site's Chinese name &quot;Qigexing&quot; has also been spelled as &quot;Shikchin&quot;, &quot;Shikshin&quot;, &quot;&lt;U+0160&gt;ik&lt;U+0161&gt;in&quot;, &quot;Xikeqin&quot;, or &quot;Xigexing&quot;. The archaeologist Albert Gr&lt;U+00FC&gt;nwedel who worked at the site during the third German Turfan expedition (1905-1907) referred to the site as &quot;&lt;U+0160&gt;or&lt;U+010D&gt;uq&quot;1(derived from the Uyghur name Xorqu), this name is also sometimes spelled as Shorchuk23, &quot;Chorchuk&quot;4, or &quot;Shorchuq&quot;5 and may refer to salt deposits in the surrounding steppes.67 The site is also referred to as &quot;Ming oi&quot; or &quot;Mingoi&quot;, a term that literally means &quot;Thousand Dwellings&quot; in the Uyghur language8 and is also used for other temple sites in the region such as the Kizil Caves.
History
Qigexing was part of the ancient Buddhist Kingdom of Karasahr (also spelled &quot;Karashara&quot;) that is first mentioned in Chinese sources from the Han Dynasty as the Kingdom of Yanqi (, the Chinese name for Karasahr). In 94 CE, Qigexing was conquered by the Han Dynasty in its reconquest of the Tarim Basin. The Buddhist monk Faxian visited the area of Yanqi around 400 CE and mentions the presence of about 4,000 monks who were practicing Hinayana Buddhism.9 The monk Xuanzang, who lived in the 7th century CE, reports the existence of 10 Buddhist monasteries with 2,000 monks who belonged to the Sarvastivada school of Buddhism in the area around Yanqi.10 In 719 CE, the Tang Dynasty established one of the Four Garrisons of Anxi in Yanqi, the other garrisons were in Kucha, Kashgar, and Hotan. Aurel Stein hypothesized that the Buddhist temples of Qigexing were burned during an iconoclasm after Islam became the state religion of the Kara-Khanid Khanate.11 Archeological finds in Qigexing include the ruins of larger temple compounds (with more than 100 buildings in total12) as well as twelf cave temples1314. The remains of some wall paintings and in particular sculptures have been discovered at the site. Sculptures have been found as individual figures as well as in friezes. The style of the artworks mixes indo-iranian elments with Chinese styles.15 The depiction of human heads at the site has a characteristic style with faces that are bulged out like balloons.16 The Qigexing site is also an important source for manuscripts written in the East Tocharian language, also known as Tocharian A or Agnean after Agni an ancient name for Yanqi. Of the 1150 leaves and fragments in East Tocharian that were included in a 2007 survey, 383 came from a single scriptorum in Qigexing.17
The site was investigated by Albert Gr&lt;U+00FC&gt;nwedel during third German Turfan expedition (1905-1907)1819, by Aurel Stein in December 190720, as well as by Sergey Oldenburg during the Russian Turkistan Expedition (1909-1910)21.
