Robin Alexander E. Shroot (born 26 March 1988) is an English-born footballer who plays for Birmingham City as a midfielder. He made his first-team debut in the FA Cup third round match against Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. in January 2009. He has represented Northern Ireland at under-21 level.
Club career
Shroot was born in London. He began his football career as an eight-year-old with Wimbledon, remaining with the club until released at 16.12 He then joined Staines Town's academy, which operated in association with Kingston College.3 He scored the only goal in the 2006 Middlesex Premier Cup final, the first time the club had even reached the final,4 and contributed to the side reaching the Southern Youth League championship play-off and (as Kingston College) the final of the English Schools' Football Association U-18 Colleges' Trophy.56 Shroot never played for Staines' Isthmian League Premier Division team, though he was an occasional unused substitute,7 and scored in the final as the club won the Southern Combination Cup, a first-team competition.8
In September 2006, Shroot joined AFC Wimbledon, also of the Isthmian League Premier. The club described him as a &quot;skilful ball-playing winger who likes to take on opponents and deliver telling crosses&quot;.9 He made his league debut, showing &quot;plenty of promise&quot; as he played the first 65 minutes of the 2–1 win at Ashford Town (Middlesex) on 26 September 2006.10 In the 2006–07 season he made two starts and five substitute appearances in the league without scoring.11 In November 2007, Shroot joined Harrow Borough, also of the Isthmian League Premier, on loan, initially for a month. He made his debut on 10 November 2007 in a 2–1 defeat at Margate.12 His spell with Harrow was extended to three months,13 though disrupted by injury,14 and brought him six league goals from ten games. Shroot finished the 2007–08 season with another six league goals for AFC Wimbledon from five starts and seven substitute appearances,15 contributing to the club's promotion to the Conference South. Shroot's contract expired at the end of that season. The club made him an offer which he chose not to accept, so he became available for transfer;16 manager Terry Brown felt that the player's representatives did not want him to stay with the club.17
Under the Bosman ruling, because of the player's age, compensation would be payable when he signed a contract with another club,18 but he would be allowed to play on non-contract terms, and in September 2008 he rejoined Harrow Borough on such a basis, with a view to regaining fitness following a summer operation.19 At Harrow he was reunited with player-coach Jamie Lawrence, with whom he had worked for three years at Lawrence's Tooting academy for semi-professional footballers.2021 Though he failed to score in his first four games back with Harrow, he followed up with nine goals in eight league games,22 performances which attracted interest from potential purchasers and attention from opposition defenders alike.23
In mid-December 2008, Shroot had a trial with Football League Championship club Birmingham City; he trained with the first-team group and scored in a friendly against Cheltenham Town.2425 Harrow manager, former Birmingham player David Howell, was unhappy about the motives of the player's agent, suggesting he wanted &quot;to put Robin out there for the highest bidder&quot;.26 Nevertheless, Shroot joined Birmingham on 2 January 2009, signing a two-and-a-half year contract with a one-year option,27 for what was described as a &quot;nominal&quot; fee.28
Shroot made his first-team debut on 13 January 2009, playing the whole of the FA Cup third round defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers.29
International career
Shroot qualifies to play international football for Northern Ireland because his grandmother is from that country. While still a youngster at Wimbledon, he wrote to then manager Lawrie Sanchez to tell him his international ambitions lay with Northern Ireland. He has been capped at under-19 and under-20 level,30 and played in the side which reached the final of the Milk Cup Elite section in 2007.31 Shroot's debut for the under-21s came in November 2008 when he played the first half of a 3–1 defeat of their Scottish counterparts in November 2008.3233
Personal life
Before his move to Birmingham, Shroot had coached at a South London junior club, Balham Blazers, and managed their under-13 side.34 He intended to maintain his involvement with the club when his Birmingham commitments permitted.3536
