The Sacr&lt;U+00E9&gt;-C&lt;U+0153&gt;ur Basilica (French: Basilique du Sacr&lt;U+00E9&gt;-C&lt;U+0153&gt;ur, &quot;Basilica of the Sacred Heart&quot;) is a Roman Catholic basilica and popular landmark in Paris, France, dedicated to the Sacred Heart. Sacr&lt;U+00E9&gt;-C&lt;U+0153&gt;ur is pronounced . 
The building
The basilica is located at the summit of the butte Montmartre (Montmartre butte), the highest point in the city.
The original idea of constructing a church dedicated to the Sacred Heart developed in France after the Franco-Prussian War (1870). Architect Paul Abadie designed the basilica after winning a competition over 77 other architects, but he died not long after the foundation had been laid, in 1884, and other architects continued with the work. The overall style of the structure shows heavy Romano-Byzantine influence. Many design elements of the basilica are based on nationalistic themes: the portico, with its three arches, is adorned by two equestrian statues of French national saints Joan of Arc and King Saint Louis IX, both executed in bronze by Lefebvre; and the nineteen-ton Savoyarde bell (one of the world's heaviest), cast in 1895 in Annecy, alludes to the annexation of Savoy in 1860. 
Construction costs (amounting to some 40 million French francs) were originally funded by a national subscription in 1873, but the state ultimately assumed responsibility for funding. Construction began in 1875 and was completed in 1914, although consecration of the basilica was delayed until after the First World War.
Sacr&lt;U+00E9&gt;-C&lt;U+0153&gt;ur is built of travertine stone quarried in Ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau-Landon (Seine-et-Marne), France. This stone constantly exudes calcite, which ensures that the basilica remains white even with weathering and pollution.
A mosaic in the apse, entitled Christ in Majesty, is among the world's largest.

Nave, apse and altar of the basilica

The basilica complex includes a garden for meditation, with a fountain. The top of the dome is open to tourists and affords a spectacular panoramic view of the city of Paris, which is mostly to the south of the basilica.
Role in Catholicism
In response to requests from French bishops, Pope Pius IX promulgated the doctrine of the Sacred Heart in 1856. The basilica itself was consecrated on October 16, 1919.
Since 1885 (before construction had been completed), the Blessed Sacrament (a consecrated host which has been turned into the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ during Mass) has been continually on display in a monstrance above the high altar. Perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament has continued uninterrupted in the Basilica since 1885.

The area before the basilica has featured in many films, notably in 2001 film Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie (Le fabuleux destin d'Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie Poulain).
The basilica can also be seen in the window in background of the Audrey Hepburn film &quot;Sabrina&quot; while she is writing home to her father before returning home to America.
In the anime series Noir, the lead character Mireille Bouquet has a rendez-vous with Remi Breffort, a high profile member of the secret organization Les Soldats, inside the basilica.
