Post-race

 Gordon appeared in victory lane after his victory lap to start celebrating his first win of the season, and his second Sprint Cup win at Phoenix International Raceway,30 in front of a crowd of 75,000 people.31 &quot;I was feeling the emotions, but to see (the fans) react like that. Then the push truck pushed me around and to see them all the way down (the frontstretch) doing that, I was like, &lt;U+2018&gt;I don't know if I've ever experienced something like that.&lt;U+2019&gt; And that to me made it all worth it right there to have that feeling,&quot; said Gordon of his triumph.32
Although Kyle Busch was leading the race near the end, Gordon passed him with nine laps left.33 Kyle Busch, who finished second, said, &quot;He was on a mission today, that's for sure.When Jeff Gordon has a good car and he has the opportunity to beat you, he's going to beat you. He's my hero. I've always watched him and what he's been able to accomplish over the years.&quot;34 In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, &quot;I&lt;U+2019&gt;m not exactly sure what happened. I&lt;U+2019&gt;ll have to talk to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t know I was there, but I watched the tape and I think he really did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield.&quot;35 Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, but he also stated:

Kyle Busch also commented, &quot;When Jeff Gordon has a good car and he's got the opportunity to beat you, he's going to beat you, there's no doubt about that. He's my hero and I've always watched him and what he's been able to accomplish over the years, so it's no surprise that he beat us.&quot;&lt;ref name='gordonwinsespn&gt; The race result left Kyle Busch leading the Driver's Championship with 80 points.36 Kurt Busch, who finished eighth, was second on 77, eight points ahead of Stewart and Allmendinger.37 Gordon was fifth with 65 points.38 Ford maintained their lead in the Manufacturers' Championship with 12 points.39 Toyota and Chevrolet placed second and third with the same amount of points, four ahead of Dodge in fourth.40 10.36 million people watched the race on television.41
