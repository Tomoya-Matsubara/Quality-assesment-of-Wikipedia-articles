Tea and Sympathy is the debut solo album by Australian singer/songwriterBernard Fanning, who is also the lead vocalist of Powderfinger. Released by Universal and Dew Process in October 2005, critics praised the album, which showcased Fanning's songwriting abilities, and it achieved commercial success debuting at #1 on the Australian album chart and was awarded Album of the Year in the 2006 ARIA Awards.
Background, production and recording
In February 2005 when Powderfinger decided to take a break from recording and touring, Fanning continued to write songs. He decided to record these songs on the label Dew Process, the record label started by Powderfinger manager Paul Piticco. Fanning enlisted famed music producer Tchad Blake who had worked with Crowded House, Tom Waits and Gomez to co-producer and mixed the album for him. The album was recorded in the Bath countryside studio Real World Studios, owned by Peter Gabriel. Fanning used an international blend of musicians to play on the album, including having Blake play the lap steel guitar also. The recording and mixing occured very quickly, taking only four weeks in total while there, finishing in mid June 2005, having completed the recording of ten songs.
Upon returning to Brisbane, Fanning recorded four more songs (&quot;Not Finished Just Yet,&quot; &quot;Believe,&quot; &quot;Wash Me Clean&quot; and &quot;Hope &amp; Validation&quot;)in his home studio (Leafy Bug Studios) with Powderfinger's live engineer Mark McElligott as the track engineer and mixer. The musicians were local Brisbane musicians for these sessions. These musicians then formed Fanning's touring band for the following live performances.
Bernard co-produced all tracks featured on Tea and Sympathy and as well as singing he played guitar, keyboards, harmonica and percussion.
Singles
The first single from the album, &quot;Wish You Well&quot; was the #1 most added track to Australian radio in the week it was issued for airplay. It was not released commercially as a CD single and neither was the next single, &quot;Songbird.&quot;
The album's final single &quot;Watch Over Me&quot; was the only one to be released as a CD single and was nominated for an ARIA award for best single.
Proceeds from the single &quot;Watch Over Me&quot; were donated to the charity Youngcare.1 Fanning also organised a concert in support of the charity and performed with Kasey Chambers2.
