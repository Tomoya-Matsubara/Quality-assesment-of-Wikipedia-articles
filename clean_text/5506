Career
Charlie Madigan series
Gay's debut novel, The Better Part of Darkness, was released in November 2009. It is the first book in the Charlie Madigan series. Set in Atlanta, the story presents a future in which humanity has discovered two paranormal dimensions. As a result, Earth becomes a new home for various benevolent or malicious supernatural beings. The series follows the personal and professional challenges of Charlie Madigan, a single mother and a policewoman.
A review from Booklist called the first novel &quot;extraordinary.&quot;7 Publishers Weekly stated, &quot;Intricate world-building and richly complex characters mix with a fast-paced plot to create a standout start to a new series.&quot;8 The Better Part of Darkness was a double finalist in the 2010 RITA Awards, presented by Romance Writers of America.9 The novel also received recognition from the Southern Independent Booksellers Alliance, a trade association representing southern-area book stores in the United States. SIBA identified the novel as an &quot;Okra Pick&quot; in 2009, and also as a Long List Book Award Finalist the following year.10
The second Charlie Madigan novel, The Darkest Edge of Dawn, was released in August 2010. Romantic Times Book Reviews called it better than its predecessor, and remarked that the &quot;tight plotting keeps the pace brisk and the action exciting.&quot;11 The book was also nominated for a 2010 Australian Romance Readers Award, appearing in the category of &quot;Favourite Sci-Fi, Urban Fantasy or Futuristic Romance&quot;.12
Young-adult fiction
In 2010, Gay revealed plans to write young-adult fiction under the name Kelly Keaton.13 Her first YA novel, Darkness Becomes Her, was released in February 2011. The book presents a post-disaster New Orleans, renamed New 2, which is largely abandoned and believed to be inhabited by paranormal beings. An isolated teenager named Ari returns to New 2 seeking answers about her past, finding new mysteries and allies along the way. A review from School Library Journal stated that the story &quot;paints richly detailed scenes of the New Orleans landscape and crafts fully realized, sympathetic characters. Ari&lt;U+2019&gt;s journey from loner to wary member of a band of misfits and her fall for one of them spins a compelling thread through her quest.&quot;14 Author Christopher Pike called the book, &quot;Unforgettable, complex, and unique.&quot;15
