Yde (Adelaide) Schloenbach (later Blumenschein by marriage, born in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo, on May 26, 1882) is a Brazilian poet best known as Colombina.
Poet and chronicler, she started writing at the age of 13, her first poems being published in A Tribuna, newspaper of the city of Santos. She wrote for magazines and newspapers like O Malho, Fon-Fon, Careta and Jornal das Mo&lt;U+00E7&gt;as. Besides &quot;Colombina&quot;, she also used the pen name of &quot;Paula Brasil&quot;.
In 1948 she founded the &quot;Casa do Poeta Lampi&lt;U+00E3&gt;o de G&lt;U+00E1&gt;s&quot;, a literary society that initially met at her own home. This society published a monthly newspaper, &quot;O Fanal&quot;, of which she was the publisher.
Her poetry is centered on the theme of love, usually treated in a quite innocent way, though some of her poems have a more erotic vein that caused some scandal at her time. Her last book, Raps&lt;U+00F3&gt;dia Rubra - Poemas &lt;U+00E0&gt; Carne (&quot;Red Rapsody - Poems Dedicated to Flesh&quot;) reflects this trend, and its highly erotic poetry was particularly polemical at the time of its publishing.
