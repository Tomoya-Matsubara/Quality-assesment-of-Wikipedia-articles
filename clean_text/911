The FR8 is a regional railway route. It forms part of the network of the Lazio regional railways (), which is operated by Trenitalia, and converges on the city of Rome, Italy.
The route operates over the infrastructure of the Rome&lt;U+2013&gt;Formia&lt;U+2013&gt;Naples and Albano&lt;U+2013&gt;Nettuno railways. Within the territory of the comune of Rome, it plays the role of a commuter railway. It is estimated that on average about 40,000 passengers travel on an FR8 train each day.
The designation FR8 appears only in publicity material (e.g. public transport maps), in the official timetables, and on signs at some stations. The electronic destination boards at stations on the FR7 route show only the designation &quot;R&quot; and the relevant train number.
