 Chaubunagungamaug Reservation in Webster, Massachusetts, was established in the 1680s for the group of Nipmuc Indians now known as the Webster/Dudley Band of Chaubunagungamaug Nipmuck.
For two centuries (the 1680s until the 1890s), this reservation supported a community of Nipmuck. From the 1890s until the mid-1970s the Nipmuck presence on this land consisted of the Morse family and their immediate relatives. From 1978 through the mid-1990s, the Chaubunagungamaug Band, as an organization, appears to have consisted, essentially, only of the extended Morse family.
Together with the Hassanamisco Nipmuc of Grafton, Massachusetts and other families and individuals who identified as Nipmuc Indian, this group received recognition from the Massachusetts Commission on Indian Affairs in 1979.
Although the Nipmuck are recognized by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in 2004 the Bureau of Indian Affairs decided that the Chaubunagungamaug Nipmuc group does not meet four of the seven mandatory requirements for U.S. Federal Government acknowledgment as a &quot;nation&quot;.
