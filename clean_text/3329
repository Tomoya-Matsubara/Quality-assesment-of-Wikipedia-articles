Carlos Galv&lt;U+00E3&gt;o de Melo (born 1921) was a Portuguese military officer. One of the members of the National Salvation Junta, after the 25 April 1974 Carnation Revolution that overthrew the Estado Novo (New State) regime and established democracy in Portugal. He soon became known as one of the most conservative member of the Junta, if not reactionary. Often seen as a far-right politician, in 1980 he was a presidential candidate, but won a very small amount of votes.
In the 1990s, he drew controversy due to his support for the Indonesian anexation of East Timor.
