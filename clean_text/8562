Early life
Cho was born in Pohang,8 Korea, on 13 October 1940,910 during the period of Japanese occupation. He was the eldest of three brothers.11 He began training in the martial arts when he was around 10 years old.12 In an interview, he commented on his childhood in Pohang, Korea: &quot;Although they were not really gang members, young people used to roam from town to town and beat up kids and take away their toys. One time, I was beaten up by some boys around 12 or 13 years old. At the time I thought it was pretty bad, so I wanted to protect myself.&quot;13 Cho attained the rank of 1st dan black belt by the age of 13,14 and had reached 4th dan by the age of 21.15 In addition to taekwondo, he also trained in boxing for two years.16
Career
In 1962, at the age of 22, Cho entered the Korean army for compulsory military service; during that time, he taught taekwondo to special forces in the Korean, Indian, and US armies.17 In 1968, Cho emigrated from South Korea to the United States of America.18 At the time, he held the rank of 6th dan.19 He initially moved to Chicago, but did not stay for long, moving through South Bend,2021 Milwaukee,2223 and Providence,24 before settling in Los Angeles in 1975.2526 Cho was based in Los Angeles for around 25 years, before moving to Albuquerque, and a few years later, to Hawaii.27
During the early days of teaching in the US, there were at least two incidents in which challengers attacked Cho, and in one of these incidents, the challenger later sued Cho for injuries he received as a result of attacking Cho.28 Cho later commented in an interview: &quot;All this has created a great conflict within me, for if I cannot use my skill to protect myself from any person who walks in off the street and demands a fight, how can I hope my students will retain confidence in my ability to teach them this skill? And yet, if I use my skill and hurt someone, even in self-defense, have I not betrayed the spirit of what martial arts are all about?&quot;29
Cho's books include Man of Contrasts (1981), The Complete Martial Artist (1981; two volumes),3031 The Complete Tae Kwon Do Hyung (1984; three volumes covering the Chang Hon patterns), The Complete Tae Geuk Hyung WTF (1988), and The Complete One &amp; Three Step Sparring (1988).32

Personal life
Cho has two brothers, Kuy Ha Cho (Vice-President of AIMAA) and In Kyu Cho (Chairman of AIMAA), who are also martial art masters.36 Cho's first wife was Sally Walsh,3738 who demonstrates self-defence techniques in the second volume of Cho's Complete Martial Artist books.39 His second wife is named Mihyun.4041 Cho has two sons: Jason, 4th dan, based in Houston, Texas;42 and Jacob, 2nd dan, based in Laguna Beach, California.43 His daughter, Jasmine, also trains in taekwondo.44 Cho underwent open-heart surgery in 2006,45 and currently lives and teaches in Honolulu, Hawaii.46
