Apollo Smile (born Paula Apollo Anne Scharf on February 16, 1967 in New York City) is a pop music songwriter, singer and voice actress. Among her earliest efforts was a track on the Tom Cruise film Days of Thunder and a self-titled 1991 album. Later on, she billed herself as &quot;The Live Action Anime Girl&quot; and was invited to several science fiction conventions as a guest. Her convention appearances usually showcased music concerts featuring her original upbeat music and demonstrations of her martial arts abilities. Her typical look during this time was skin-tight spandex clothing, with her blonde hair in pigtails tied off with pink bows.
Smile hosted Sci-Fi Channel's Anime Week in the summer of 1998. Other notable projects included a self-published comic book featuring herself as the central character and the voice of Ulala in the Space Channel 5 video game series.
In more recent years, Apollo Smile has seemingly moved away from the &quot;anime girl&quot; role she created for herself, seeking small but more conventional film and television roles. She also toured for a short while with the Virginia &quot;Atari&quot; band Rockbot.
