The Lexus LS is a full-size luxury sedan that serves as the flagship model of Lexus, the luxury division of Toyota. Four generations of the sedan have been produced, all equipped with V8 engines and rear-wheel drive. Since 2006, all-wheel drive, hybrid, and long wheelbase variants have also been offered. The original Lexus LS 400, the first Lexus to be developed, was introduced as the luxury marque's debut model in 1989. Following the initial model, subsequent redesigns included the second generation LS 400 in 1995, LS 430 in 2001, and the LS 460 / LS 460 L series in 2006. A domestic market version of the LS 400 and LS 430, badged the Toyota Celsior, was sold in Japan until the Lexus marque was introduced to the country in 2006. For the 2007 model year, the LS 460 debuted the first production eight-speed automatic transmission and an automatic parking system. In 2007, V8 hybrid powertrains were introduced on the LS 600h / LS 600h L variants of the fourth generation sedan.
The Lexus LS began development in 1983 as the F1 project, the code name for a secret flagship sedan effort. Following an extended five-year design process at a cost of over US$1 billion, the resulting sedan premiered with a new V8 engine and multiple luxury features. The Lexus LS was intended for export markets from its inception, and the Lexus division was formed to market and service the vehicle internationally. The original LS 400 debuted to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque. Each successive iteration of the vehicle has ranked as the best-selling flagship luxury sedan in the United States.
Since the start of production, each generation of the Lexus LS has been produced in the city of Tahara, Aichi, in Japan. In U.S. consumer publications, Lexus' flagship model is recognized as one of the most reliable vehicles ever built, having held the top ranking in J.D. Power and Associates' U.S. Vehicle Dependability Survey for fifteen consecutive years, and receiving Consumer Reports' highest rankings for vehicle dependability. __TOC__ {{-}}
First generation (UCF10)

UCF10 (1989)
In August 1983, Toyota chairman Eiji Toyoda initiated the F1 project (&quot;Flagship&quot; and &quot;No. 1 vehicle&quot;; alternatively called the &quot;Circle-F&quot; project), a clandestine effort aimed at producing a world-class luxury sedan for international markets.12 The F1 development effort did not have a specific budget or time constraints, and the resulting vehicle did not utilize existing Toyota platforms or parts.34 Instead, chief engineer Ichiro Suzuki sought to develop an all-new design, aiming to surpass rival American and European flagship sedans in specific target areas, including exterior aerodynamics, cabin quiet, overall top speed, and fuel efficiency.5 During development, 3,900 F1 personnel built approximately 450 flagship prototypes and 900 engine prototypes,6 and logged 2.7 million kilometres of testing on locations ranging from winter Europe roadways, deserts in Arizona, Australia, and Saudi Arabia, to U.S. highways and wilderness areas.78

An early Lexus LS design sketch

In the fall of 1985, designers presented the first exterior study models to F1 management, featuring a sports car-like design with a low-slung hood and narrow front profile.9 By 1986, the sedan used a three box design with an upright stance, more prominent grille, and a two-tone body.10 Extensive modeling and wind tunnel tests resulted in a low drag coefficient for a conventional production vehicle of the time (Cd 0.29).11 For the passenger cabin, materials selection tests evaluated 24 different kinds of wood and multiple types of leather for two years before settling on specific trim combinations.12 By 1986, the Lexus marque was created to support the launch of the flagship sedan,13 and the vehicle became known as the Lexus LS.14 Following eight design reviews, subsequent revisions, and over US$1 billion in development expenses, the final design for the production Lexus LS 400 (chassis code UCF10) was approved in 1987.15
In January 1989, the LS 400 made its debut as a 1990 model at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan.16 U.S. sales began in September 1989, followed by limited exports to Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.17 The LS 400's new 4.0 liter 1UZ-FE 32-valve V8 engine, capable of  and  of torque,18 linked with a new four-speed automatic transmission with electronically-controlled shifts.19 The chassis used an independent, double-wishbone suspension setup,20 with an air suspension option.21 The LS 400's 0&lt;U+2013&gt; time was 8.5 seconds, and its top speed was .22 Compared to the rival BMW 735i (E32) and Mercedes-Benz 420 SE (W126), the LS 400 had a quieter cabin (58 dB at ), higher top speed, lower drag coefficient and curb weight, and avoided the U.S. gas-guzzler tax.232425

The LS 400 was among the first luxury sedans to feature an automatic tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror.2627 The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electroluminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual effect, with indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel.2829 The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities.303132 The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence,33 including fluid-damped cabin fixtures,34 vibration-insulating rubber mounts,35 airflow fairings,36 and sandwich steel body panels.37

1989&lt;U+2013&gt;1992 Toyota Celsior (UCF10; Japan)

In Japan, the launch of Lexus was complicated by Toyota's existing five domestic dealership networks,38 several of which sold Japan-only luxury models, including the Toyota Crown and Toyota Crown Majesta.39 During the LS 400's development, local dealers' requests for a Japanese domestic market version had grown,40 and a right-hand drive, Toyota Celsior-badged version was introduced shortly after the LS 400's U.S. debut.41 The Celsior, named after the Latin word for 'supreme', was largely identical to the LS.42 Models came in either basic &quot;A&quot;, upgraded suspension &quot;B&quot;, or fully-equipped &quot;C&quot; trim specifications, and were sold at dealerships which also carried Japan-only Toyota luxury models.43
In December 1989, shortly after the LS 400's launch, Lexus ordered a voluntary recall of the 8,000 vehicles sold so far, based upon two customer complaints over defective wiring and an overheated brake light; all vehicles were serviced within 20 days, and the incident helped establish Lexus' customer service reputation.444546 By 1990, U.S. sales of the LS 400 had surpassed those of competing Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Jaguar models.47 Adding incentive for early U.S. sales was a base price of US$35,000, which undercut competitors by thousands of dollars.48 Production of the first generation LS 400 totaled over 165,000 units.49 Years after its introduction, the LS 400 remained a reliable choice for a used car, making Consumer Reports' 2007 list of recommended vehicles which regularly last  or more with proper maintenance.50

1992&lt;U+2013&gt;1994 Lexus LS 400 (UCF10 II)

UCF10 II (1992)
Debuting in September 1992 as a 1993 model, the refreshed LS 400 (UCF10 II) was introduced with more than 50 changes, largely in response to customer and dealer requests.51 The vehicle received larger disc brakes, wheels and tires, and adjustments were made to the suspension and power steering system to improve handling.52 Stylistic changes included additional body side moldings, a revised grille, along with a greater selection of colors.53 For the interior, passenger front airbags, an external temperature gauge, digital odometer, seat belt pretensioners, and chlorofluorocarbon-free refrigerant were added.5455 By 1994, the LS 400's U.S. base price exceeded US$50,000, a figure that had steadily risen since the vehicle's introduction. Customer demand for the vehicle and shifts in foreign exchange rates contributed to the increase in price.56 
Second generation (UCF20)

UCF20 (1994)
The second generation Lexus LS 400 (UCF20) debuted in November 1994 for the 1995 model year with a longer wheelbase and similar specifications as the original model. The public unveiling of the vehicle occurred in a gala ceremony held at the San Francisco Opera House in California.57 The sedan was equipped with an updated 4.0 liter 1UZ-FE V8 engine producing  and  of torque.58 Internally, over 90 percent of the redesigned LS 400's composition was new or redesigned,59 with increased sound insulation, a strengthened body structure, suspension updates, and improved brakes.60 The redesigned model was  lighter than its predecessor, and achieved slightly better fuel economy.61 The 0&lt;U+2013&gt; time improved to 7.5 seconds.62

1994-1996 Toyota Celsior (UCF20; Japan)

Given the first generation model's successful reception and high levels of customer satisfaction with its design, replicating the original LS 400's attributes with its successor was one of chief engineer Kazuo Okamoto's primary goals (stating that &quot;a tradition cannot be founded if you reject the first generation&quot;).63 Externally, the most significant change was a increase in wheelbase length of , resulting in more interior space and an additional  of rear seat legroom.64 However, as the overall length remained the same, trunk capacity was slightly reduced.65 The more aerodynamic body (Cd 0.28) retained the general profile and contours of the original LS 400,6667 and was the work of the Calty Design Research center in the U.S.68 Designers had evaluated 20 competing concepts, including several with a radically changed body,69 before selecting a winning entry which included similar forms and contours as the original LS 400.70 An evolutionary redesign was the ultimate result, with new design features consisting of sharper angles, curved body lines, and a beveled grille.71 More prominent side lines provided a reference point for parking maneuvers, and improved forward visibility.72

Second generation LS 400 cabin (UCF20)

The redesigned LS 400 interior received upgraded features, varying from dual-zone climate controls to rear cupholders.73 A newly-patented seat cushion design, similar to the car's suspension, utilized lightweight internal coil springs and stabilizer bars to improve comfort.74 One of the first in-dash CD changers was offered as an option.75 Safety enhancements included enlarged crumple zones, three-point seatbelts at all positions, and a new collapsible steering column.76 In Japan, the Toyota Celsior equivalents were offered in the same &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and top-spec &quot;C&quot; configurations as before, along with an additional selection of exterior colors.77 Several optional features, such as a compact disc-based Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation system and reclining rear seats, were only available in Japan.78

1997 &quot;Coach Edition&quot; LS 400 (UCF20; U.S.)

At its U.S. debut, the redesigned LS 400 retained a pricing advantage versus European competitors in its largest market, launching with a base price of US$51,000.79 However, cost differences had narrowed following more aggressive pricing and added feature content from rival manufacturers.80 To promote their new flagship, Lexus launched a US$50 million advertising campaign, the most expensive marketing effort since the launch of the division.81 In mid-1995, sales slowed as the U.S. government threatened tariffs on Japanese luxury cars over the widening U.S.-Japan trade deficit, potentially raising the price of a fully-optioned LS 400 to over US$100,000.82 Subsequent negotiations averted the sanctions by summer of that year, and sales recovered in the following months.83 Ultimately, second generation LS 400 sales were not as voluminous as the original model,84 and production totaled approximately 114,000 units.85
Production of the second LS 400 followed the same time frame as the original, lasting from 1995 to 2000, with a mid-cycle refresh in 1998. For 1997, a limited &quot;Coach Edition&quot; LS 400 was produced in partnership with American leather manufacturer Coach Inc.. The edition featured Coach leather seats, embroidered emblems on the exterior, floormats, and armrest, special colors and added trim, and a Coach cabin bag; production was limited to a yearly run of 2,500 units.86
UCF20 II (1997)

1997&lt;U+2013&gt;2000 Lexus LS 400 (UCF20 II)

Debuted in September 1997, the revised LS 400 (UCF20 II) was introduced with a five-speed automatic transmission, increased engine output to  with variable valve timing (VVT-i), and an added  of torque.87 Acceleration times and fuel economy were improved as a result.88 The suspension and steering also received minor tweaks to improve feel and handling.89 Stylistically, the vehicle sported a new front fascia, side mirrors, and wheels;90 a rear windshield diversity antenna replaced the conventional power mast.91 The cabin received upgrades including a trip computer, HomeLink, retractable rear headrests, reading lamps, and ultraviolet-tinted glass,92 while the climate control gained a micron filtration feature with a smog sensor. A hard disk drive-based GPS navigation system became an option in the U.S. Added safety features included front side airbags, vehicle stability control, and in 2000, brake assist.93 The headlights were also equipped with a programmable delay feature for proximity illumination.94 For 2000, the limited &quot;Platinum Series&quot; LS 400 was introduced at the Chicago Auto Show in partnership with American Express. The edition featured most luxury options standard, along with separate exterior colors, wheels, badging, and two years no-fee use of an American Express Platinum Card.95 
Third generation (UCF30)

UCF30 (2000)
The third generation Lexus LS 430 (UCF30) debuted at the North American International Auto Show in January 2000 as a 2001 model, introducing a new body design and a host of new interior and technological features. The sedan was equipped with a new 4.3 liter 3UZ-FE engine generating  and  of torque.96 The standard suspension had been completely redesigned, with a double-wishbone setup at all four wheels, and a Euro-tuned suspension was offered for the first time.97 A new torque-activated electronic control unit made throttle adjustments based on vehicle speed, engine revolutions per minute, and pedal position.98 The LS 430 sported a 0&lt;U+2013&gt; acceleration time of 6.7 seconds.99 Sales began in October 2000 in the U.S.100

2000&lt;U+2013&gt;2002 Lexus LS 430 (UCF30)

Heading into the planning of the LS 430, division executives concluded that the previous LS redesign had been too restrained in its approach.101 The LS 430 development team, led by chief engineer Yasushi Tanaka, accordingly opted for a more thorough exterior, interior, and technological redevelopment. Selected from 16 different prototype designs, the resulting vehicle saw the sedan's dimensions increase in terms of wheelbase and height.102103 The exterior featured a larger grille with rounded edges, quarter windows on the rear doors, and rounded trapezoidal headlamps. The body was also more aerodynamic than previous LS sedans (Cd 0.26; 0.25 with air suspension),104 and was the product of wind tunnel testing at facilities used for Shinkansen bullet train development.105 A  wheelbase stretch resulted in more interior volume and allowed the engine to be positioned further aft for better balance.106 Trunk space was increased by one-third due to repositioning of the fuel tank.107
Compared to previous generations, the LS 430 featured a greater number of model configurations and options.108 While sharing the same body style, variants were differentiated by chassis configuration and onboard equipment. Models with the Euro-tuned sport suspension, sold as the &quot;Touring&quot; package in the U.S.,109 featured larger, high-speed brakes.110 These brakes were also standard on European market models.111 Fully-optioned models with height adjustable air suspension, tuned for a combination of soft ride and responsive handling, were sold in the U.S. as the &quot;Ultra Luxury&quot; edition.112

Third generation LS 430 cabin (UCF30)

The LS 430 interior featured walnut wood trim on the dashboard and upper doors, along with semi-aniline leather and oscillating air conditioning vents.113114 A liquid crystal display touchscreen on the center console was incorporated with the DVD-based GPS navigation system, which added voice recognition capability. New options ranged from a Mark Levinson premium sound system to laser cruise control.115116 In its highest trim specification, the LS 430 included Lexus Link telematics, power door and trunk closers, and power reclining massage rear seats equipped with audio controls, power sunshade, a cooler, and air purifier.117118 Several rear seat features adopted for the LS 430 had been previously available in Japanese market luxury vehicles.119 Safety features added to the LS 430 included front and rear side curtain airbags, park sensors, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and electronic brakeforce distribution.120 The vehicle also gained water repellent windshield and side glass.121

2000&lt;U+2013&gt;2003 Lexus LS 430 (UCF30; Europe)

The LS 430 first went on sale in the U.S. with an initial base price of US$55,000 ranging up to US$70,000 when fully equipped.122 At the high end, the LS 430's pricing encroached on European rivals as Lexus became increasingly able to command higher price premiums for its vehicles.123 Sales for the LS 430 surpassed the previous generation, and production exceeded 140,000 units.124 The LS 430 was produced until 2006, marking the last occasion the Lexus flagship was produced in a single body style. In Japan, the equivalent Toyota Celsior was also sold until the 2006 model year, when the long-awaited introduction of Lexus Japan saw the arrival of new generation Lexus models.125
In every year of production, the LS 430 was the most reliable luxury sedan in the J.D. Power and Associates Initial Quality Survey (with the early and late models of this series the best performing),126127128 and the highest recorded scorer in the history of J.D. Power's Vehicle Dependability Survey.129 Thatcham ratings data via the UK Motor Insurance Repair Research Centre listed the theft prevention capabilities of the LS 430 as a maximum 5 stars, with the LS 430 being the first automobile to achieve the maximum theft-deterrence rating in 2001.130131

2003&lt;U+2013&gt;2005 Lexus LS 430 (UCF30 II)

UCF30 II (2003)
The LS 430 (UCF30 II) update debuted in September 2003 as a 2004 model, introducing a new six-speed automatic transmission and revised styling.132 The powerplant remained the same as before. Exterior changes included restyled front and rear fascias, redesigned adaptive headlights which swiveled the projector headlamps in the direction of vehicle turns, light-emitting diode (LED) taillights, and different wheels.133 The interior received knee airbags, lighted rear seat vanity mirrors, and new trim selections including bird's eye maple wood.134 New options included an updated navigation system, Bluetooth, backup camera, and a pre-collision system. A driver-programmable electronic key feature allowed the vehicle to detect the key fob in the owner's pocket and unlock the doors by touch.135 {{-}}
Fourth generation (USF40 / USF41)

USF40 / USF41 (2006)
In October 2005, Lexus premiered a gasoline-electric hybrid concept car, the LF-Sh (Lexus Future-Sedan hybrid), at the Tokyo Motor Show in Japan,136 publicly previewing the next Lexus flagship with a concept version for the first time. Introduced at the 2006 North American International Auto Show for the 2007 model year, the fourth generation Lexus LS became the first Lexus model to be produced in both standard and long-wheelbase versions. Based on the LF-Sh concept and using an all-new platform,137 the LS 460 (USF40) uses the standard  wheelbase, while the LS 460 L (USF41) features a stretched  wheelbase.138 The fourth generation's technical specifications were shown in greater detail at the Geneva Motor Show in February 2006.139 In 2008, all-wheel drive versions of the non-hybrid LS 460 and LS 460 L models were introduced at the Moscow International Motor Show.140

The Lexus LF-Sh concept at the 2005 Tokyo Motor Show

The LS 460 and LS 460 L are both equipped with a new 4.6 liter 1UR-FSE V8 producing  and  of torque,141142 coupled to the first production eight-speed automatic transmission.143 The previous double-wishbone front suspension is replaced with a multi-link design.144 To increase rigidity and lower upsprung weight, forged aluminum is now used for the suspension links and steering knuckles,145146 along with a single hollow machined die-cast aluminum front subframe,147 and approximately half of the body uses high-tensile steel.148 Acceleration from 0&lt;U+2013&gt; is listed at 5.7 seconds.149 The LS 460 L matches the acceleration of the lighter LS 460 despite added curb weight,150 at  more than the standard length model.
The development of the LS 460 and its variants, led by chief engineer Moritaka Yoshida,151 began as Lexus was shifting its design strategy towards a more diversified product lineup,152 with new vehicle launches largely focused on global markets.153 Plans called for the next generation LS to differentiate itself further beyond previous models in terms of design and technology.154 A &quot;Super LS&quot; model, priced above the US$100,000 ultra-luxury category,155 was also considered.156 Externally, the Lexus LS received the styling cues of Lexus' new design direction, called L-finesse.157 First shown on the LF-Sh concept, the vehicle gained body forms running the length of the car, wheel arches, arrow-shaped chrome trim, a lower-set grille, and crystalline adaptive headlamps.158 The long wheelbase LS 460 L possessed a similar profile as the LS 460, with identical overhangs in both front and rear, and longer rear doors. The forward and aft coefficient of lift was reduced to 0.02 and 0.01 respectively, while aerodynamic drag remained the same (Cd 0.26).159

Fourth generation LS 460 cabin (USF40)

The LS 460 interior gained a push-button start, thin-film transistor instrument display, and numerous luxury options ranging from a hard disk drive-based GPS navigation system and song library to a heated steering wheel and XM NavTraffic.160 The climate control offered the first infrared body temperature sensors and ceiling air diffusers in an automobile.161 An &quot;Executive&quot; seating package on the LS 460 L included a rear seat DVD entertainment system, swivel tray table, and a shiatsu massaging ottoman seat.162163
The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature, the first of its kind in the U.S., allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into pre-selected parking spaces.164 Other drive assist features varied from a brake hold system to radar cruise control, electric variable gear ratio power steering and electronically controlled braking.165 The new stability control system was improved to anticipate skids and alter steering assist and gear ratios. The suite of new safety features extended from a eye-tracking driver monitoring system to a lane departure warning system.166167 The pre-collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time,168169 along with millimeter-wavelength radar, stereo cameras, and infrared night vision projectors.170 A rear pre-collision system with whiplash-preventing active seat headrests and dual-chamber front airbags were also introduced.171172

The long-wheelbase Lexus LS 460 L (USF41)

The LS 460 and LS 460 L arrived at dealerships in Japan, the U.S., and Europe in late 2006,173 and the vehicle reached Australia, East Asia, and the Middle East in 2007.174 The U.S. base price for the 2007 LS 460 and LS 460 L was US$61,000 and US$71,000, respectively.175 From 2006&lt;U+2013&gt;2007, the average price paid for U.S. market LS 460 L sedans exceeded US$80,000, due largely to added options packages, placing the Lexus LS in the same average price range as its long wheelbase Audi, BMW, and Jaguar rivals for the first time.176
The 2006 Milan Design Week exhibition at the Museo della Permanente in Milan, Italy featured an LS 460 concept with a sculpted body along with a fiber-optic &quot;Evolving Fiber&quot; landscape.177 Since 2007, a specialized Lexus LS 460 is used in a driving simulator at Toyota's Higashifuji Technical Center in Shizuoka, Japan, for testing and development of automotive safety features. The vehicle is mounted inside a  x  high dome and surrounded by a 360&lt;U+00B0&gt; projector screen, along with a strut- and track-mounted driver occupant dome containing the forward cabin of an LS 460.178 Shown in 2009 at Tokyo's Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS-Safety) 2010 exhibition at the Miraikan museum, the LS 460 ITS-Safety concept included road-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-vehicle information-exchange technologies.179
UVF45 / UVF46 (2007)


Lexus LS 600h L hybrid (UVF46)

After debuting a hybrid powertrain with the 2005 LF-Sh concept, Lexus launched the LS 600h L (UVF46), the first production V8-powered full hybrid vehicle, at the 2006 New York International Auto Show.180 Introduced in 2007 for the 2008 model year, the long wheelbase LS 600h L is equipped with Lexus Hybrid Drive, featuring a 5.0 liter 2UR-FSE V8 engine mated to a high-output electric motor with nickel-metal hydride battery packs.181 This system uses a continuously variable transmission and generates an output of .182 Fuel economy is slightly higher overall than the lower-powered non-hybrid LS, and the hybrids achieve a Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (SULEV) rating.183184 Features specific to the LS hybrids include the first production low beam LED headlights, a leather-trimmed dash, and blue-tinted hybrid badging.185 On April 6, 2007, Lexus announced that the base price for the LS 600h L would be over US$104,000,186 surpassing the V12-equipped Toyota Century as the most expensive Japanese luxury car ever produced.187 A standard wheelbase version destined for Asia and Europe, the LS 600h (UVF45), was launched in Japan in April 2006.188
In early 2007, specialty department store Neiman Marcus offered 100 individually-numbered LS 600h L &quot;Launch Edition&quot; sedans, available only through the Neiman Marcus catalog for InCircle members.189 These models came in a separate Truffle Mica color with Alabaster interior.190 For the 2007 Milan Design Week, an &quot;Invisible Garden&quot; exhibition at the city's Zona Tortona presented a frosted LS 600h hybrid model.191 First shown at the 2008 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance,192 the LS 600h L &quot;Pebble Beach Edition&quot; was produced in partnership with the Pebble Beach Company, operator of the namesake golf courses and resorts. Limited to 50 units, these vehicles featured a two-tone interior with Pebble Beach badging and tags.193 
Manufacturing

The Lexus LS has been consistently produced on dedicated Lexus assembly lines at Toyota's flagship Tahara factory,194 located in the city of Tahara in Aichi Prefecture, Ch&lt;U+016B&gt;bu region, southwest of Nagoya, since 1989.195196 Tahara remains the sole production site, having inaugurated its new line number four specifically for assembly of the original LS 400.197 For the Lexus LS, the Tahara plant developed new molds and enhanced assembly techniques,198199 and instituted measures aiming to increase the precision of the sedan's fit-and-finish.200 The 1989 LS 400 became the first production automobile to receive extensive laser welding,201 allowing for seamless steel welds.202 A large sheet metal press was developed to reduce or eliminate panel gaps by stamping large sections whole instead of singly.203 Separately installed parts, such as exterior lights, were also spring loaded for a tighter fit.204 On the LS 400, engineers reduced door panel gaps in half versus Toyota-brand vehicles, from  to ,205 with measurements made within ;206 on the LS 430, measurement margins were increased tenfold to .207208 When production switched to the LS 460, the number of laser welds was doubled.209
Despite Tahara's large-scale automation, Lexus LS production also involves specialized personnel who are tasked with key production points, such as testing each vehicle's V8 engine via dynometer and stethoscope for calibration before installation.210211 With the LS 460, a hand-sanded paint process was introduced.212 The production standards used on the Lexus LS were eventually adopted by the manufacturer for other vehicles; in 2007 the assembly of Toyota Corolla economy cars used the same panel gap measurements as the LS 400 did eighteen years earlier.213
Industrial significance

The Lexus LS marked the first successful entrant of a Japanese manufacturer into the prestige luxury arena,214 a market that had long been dominated by established European and American brands. By 1991, with the LS 400 its top-selling model,215 Lexus had overtaken Mercedes-Benz and BMW in overall U.S. sales,216 and in 2000 the marque passed Cadillac as the luxury sales leader in the largest automotive market.217 Rival manufacturers responded with lower prices and added features.218 In particular, Mercedes-Benz reorganized its operations, shifting to a targeted-cost process similar to Lexus production methods,219 and dropped competing U.S. base prices by nearly 10%.220 To rival the LS 400,221 extra features were rushed for the launch of the 1991 Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W140),222223 causing budget overruns and costing the job of Daimler-Benz chief engineer Wolfgang Peter.224 Approximately five percent of 1989 LS 400 sales went to buyers employed by rival manufacturers, including GM, Ford, and Chrysler.225 When the LS 400 was disassembled for engineering analysis, Cadillac engineers concluded that the vehicle could not be built using existing GM methods.226 Industry publications noted the LS 400's precise panel gaps, and the subject became a common evaluation standard in road tests.227 The LS 430's interior noise level was later used as a measure of cabin quiet.228
According to industry observers, the introduction of the Lexus LS reshaped Toyota's image from that of an &quot;econobox&quot; manufacturer to the builder of an automotive standard-bearer.229230 This stood in contrast to the predictions of early detractors, including rival manufacturers who dismissed Toyota as incapable of producing a competitive luxury vehicle.231 Japanese contemporaries from the luxury divisions of Honda (Acura) and Nissan (Infiniti) had differing degrees of success;232 the mid-size V6-powered Acura Legend initially sold well, but subsequent models (renamed Acura RL) performed below sales expectations;233234 the V8-powered Infiniti Q45 closely rivaled the LS 400 in specifications and price,235 but was unsuccessful in sales, leading to its discontinuation in 2006.236 The success of the Lexus LS became a test case for mainstream manufacturers targeting upscale segments; by investing in a separate marque, Toyota was able to avoid the stigma attached to a mass-market brand charging premium prices.237 The effect of the LS 400 on the automotive industry led Automobile Magazine to name the sedan to its &quot;24 Most Important Vehicles of the 20th Century&quot; list in 1996.238

In its largest market, the U.S., the Lexus LS was the top-selling flagship luxury sedan for 15 of the first 17 years following its debut.239240 In Japan, the next largest market for the Lexus LS, the introduction of the 2007 LS 460 attracted 12,000 pre-orders,241 and the Lexus LS has gone on to sell successfully in its class.242 Following the introduction of the LS 460 and Lexus' expanded global launch in 2007,243 sales of the Lexus flagship have increasingly come from outside the brand's traditional U.S. strongholds. By 2007, the Lexus LS ranked second globally in flagship sales next to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class' 85,500 units, with 71,760 Lexus LS sedans sold worldwide,244 and over half the total coming from outside the U.S. market.245 In 2008, U.S. sales fell 42% amidst the late-2000s recession, mirroring the overall decline of the luxury car market.246
The Lexus LS has not sold as well in Europe, where Lexus suffers from smaller brand recognition, image, and a less-developed dealership network.247 In European markets such as the Czech Republic, the Lexus LS has ranked behind Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and BMW in flagship luxury car sales.248 Automotive analysts have suggested a possible rationale for the sales disparity, in that European buyers place less emphasis on vehicle reliability and have more brand loyalty to established domestic marques.249 In contrast, the Lexus LS has ranked second in sales to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, and ahead of rivals from BMW, Audi, and Jaguar, in markets outside Europe such as South Africa.250
