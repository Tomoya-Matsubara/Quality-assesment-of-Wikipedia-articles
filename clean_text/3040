The California State Assembly is the lower house of the California State Legislature. There are 80 members in the Assembly, representing an approximately equal number of constituents, with each district having a population of at least 420,000. Due to the state's large population and relatively small legislature, the Assembly has the largest population per representative ratio of any state legislature lower house and second largest of any legislative lower house in the United States; only the federal U.S. House of Representatives has a larger ratio. Since a referendum in 1990, members of the Assembly are restricted by term limits in the United States term limits, confining them to three two-year terms six years. 

The Assembly convenes at the California State Capitol in Sacramento, California Sacramento.

Leadership of the Assembly

The Speaker is elected by the majority party caucus, followed by confirmation of the full Assembly on passage of a floor vote.  Other Assembly leaders, such as the majority leader majority and minority leaders, are elected by their respective party caucuses according to each party's strength in the chamber.

The current Speaker is California Democratic Party Democrat Karen Bass California's 47th State Assembly district 47th-Los Angeles.  The Majority Leader is California Democratic Party Democrat Alberto Torrico California's 20th State Assembly district 20th-Newark, California Newark. The Minority Leader is California Republican Party Republican Sam Blakeslee California's 33rd State Assembly district 33rd-San Luis Obispo, California San Luis Obispo.

Assembly chamber
The chamber's green tones are based on the British House of Commons. The dais rests along a wall shaped like an E, with its central projection housing the rostrum. Along the cornice appears a portrait of Abraham Lincoln and a quotation from him in Latin: legislatorum est iustas leges condere It is the duty of legislators to pass just laws. Almost every decorating element is identical to the Senate Chamber.
