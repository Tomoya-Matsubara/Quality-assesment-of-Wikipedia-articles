The Paso Libertadores, also called Cristo Redentor, is a mountain pass between Argentina and Chile. It is the main transport route out of chilean capital city Santiago into Mendoza city in Argentina and so carries quite heavy traffic.
From the Argentinian side the route to the pass is a slow, gentle incline until entering a tunnel at around 3500m through the mountains. On the Chilean side the slope has a far higher grade, and the road decends down a long series of switch-backs to make the decent.
