The Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy was a principality of the Holy Roman Empire. Princely power was exercised by the Benedictine abbot of the imperial double monastery of Stavelot and Malmedy, founded in 651. At , it was the second-smallest territory in the Empire, after the Duchy of Bouillon at .1 Along with Bouillon and the Prince-Bishopric of Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge, it was one of only three principalities in the region that were never a part of the Southern Netherlands,2 all having been a part of the Lower Rhenish Imperial Circle, rather than the Burgundian Circle.3
In 1795 the principality was abolished and its territory was incorporated into the French d&lt;U+00E9&gt;partement of Ourthe.4 The Congress of Vienna in 1815 assigned Stavelot to the United Kingdom of the Netherlands5 and Malmedy to the Kingdom of Prussia; see also Eupen-Malmedy. Both are currently parts of the Kingdom of Belgium &lt;U+2014&gt; since the 1830 Belgian Revolution and the 1919 Treaty of Versailles respectively.
History
Establishment
 The town of Stavelot grew up around the Abbey of Stavelot, founded circa 650,67 out of what had been a villa, by the legendary Saint Remaclus.89 A charter of Sigebert III, king of Austrasia entrusted Remaclus with the two monasteries in the Ardennes forest, &quot;a place of horror and solitary isolation which abounds with wild beasts&quot;.101112 Sigebert granted forest land and his Mayor of the Palace, Grimoald the Elder, was charged with furnishing money to build the two monasteries &lt;U+2014&gt; Stavelot on the Ambl&lt;U+00E8&gt;ve river and Malmedy a few kilometres to the east &lt;U+2014&gt; and continued to foster these communities with personal gifts and means from the king.13 The villa's lands occupied the borderland between the bishoprics of Cologne and Tongeren,14 the territory previously having been part of the Frankish Empire, its independence dating to before the time of Charlemagne.
The monastery of Malmedy is considered by the historians and the hagiographers to be slightly older than the monastery of Stavelot,15, with the town claiming foundation in 648.16 Malmedy is listed on earlier maps than Stavelot and the commission appointed in 670 by Childeric II, in order to delimit the abbey territory, started from Malmedy ().17 Afterwards, the territory of the abbey was increased westwards so that Stavelot became the geographical center and the capital of the principality.18
The site of Malmedy was probably already settled before the foundation of the abbey, despite etymology seeming to indicate Malmedy may have been unsuitable for settlement.19  was &quot;a place with winding waters&quot; or, most probably, , a &quot;bad confluency&quot;.20 The Warchenne was partially canalised and its banks strengthened, before which Malmedy was often flooded.21
The first church in Stavelot was built by prince-abbot Godwin and, on 25 June 685, was dedicated to the saints Martin, Peter and Paul.22 The relics of Saint Remaclus were held in this new church.23 The abbey church in Malmedy was dedicated to St Benedict.lices&quot;/&gt;
Development and the High Middle Ages
  In 747, Carloman, Mayor of the Palace, increased the abbeys' lands from his own on his abdication.24 Throughout the ninth century, the abbeys played an important cultural role in Lotharingia, particularly thanks to prince-abbot Christian. Around 875, the relics of St Quirinus were translated from Gasny to Malmedy Abbey after the intercession of Emperor Charles the Bald, partly to secure relics comparable to those of St Remaclus at Stavelot.25
Through the seventh and eighth centuries, the two abbeys followed their mission of evangelism, along with forest clearance, but suffered the same decay as elsewhere with the collapse of the Carolingian Empire, with the principality in the custody of lay abbots &lt;U+2014&gt; temporal guardians &lt;U+2014&gt; from 844 to 938, including Ebbo, archbishop of Rheims, Adalard the Seneschal, Reginar and Giselbert, dukes of Lorraine, and the like.262728
Welcoming pilgrims and the sick was a part of the monks' mission. The Miracula sancti Remacli mention the , the monastery's hospice, where poor pilgrims are granted hospitality, including food for almost eight days, whilst they make their devotions; this hospice differs from the abbey's hospital: . On 13 April 862, Lothair II of Lotharingia, while dealing with the distribution of property &quot;&quot;, ordered that local tithes be paid to the hospital &quot;&quot;, an order he confirmed on 10 June 873.29
In December 881, Normans invaded the area, including Godfrid, Duke of Frisia, burning both abbeys and causing the monks to flee with their treasures and relics.30tude&quot;/&gt;313233 Several historical sources provide evidence on the raid of 881, which was well prepared and organised. The monks rushed to dig up the relics of Remaclus and fled to the county of Porcien in present-day Bogny-sur-Meuse in the French Ardennes; the surrounding region was largely unaffected by the invasion.34 Stavelot and Malmedy were both burned, with the monks not returning until just before Christmas 882, with a stay in Chooz allowed them to repair the roofs of the monastic buildings. Relics from Aachen, which had been entrusted to the monks at Stavelot because of the Norman threat, were returned intact.35 In gratitude, on 13 November 882, Charles the Fat, Carolingian emperor and king of East Francia, Alemannia and Italy, granted the abbeys the lands of Blendef, a dependency of Louveign&lt;U+00E9&gt;, and restored to them the chapel in Bra (now a part of Lierneux in Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge).36
In 885, Normans extracted ransom from Hesbaye and passed through the Meuse valley, marching on Pr&lt;U+00FC&gt;m, causing the monks of Stavelot to flee again, finding refuge in the county of Logne and Ch&lt;U+00E8&gt;vremont; the Miracula Remacli details the flight from the invaders and follows the monks' wanderings.37 After the invasions, abbot Odilon rebuilt the ruined abbey of Stavelot; with support from bishops of Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge &lt;U+2014&gt; including Notker, the first prince-bishop &lt;U+2014&gt; the abbots Odilon and Werinfride rebuilt the abbeys, with new buildings, the re-establishment of the monastic community and the re-organisation of the principality; by the time of the Ottonian dynasty in the early 10th century, the abbeys were once again of suitable Imperial stature.tude&quot;/&gt; A new abbey church was built in Malmedy in 992, dedicated to St Quirinus;38 in 1007, a parish church was consecrated to Saint Gereon.39
Another danger threatened the abbey &lt;U+2014&gt; and the Western Empire &lt;U+2014&gt; in the tenth century: the Hungarian invasions. Having been deposed as duke of Lotharingia, Conrad the Red invited the Hungardans to undermine his opponents, Bruno the Great, archbishop of Cologne, and Reginar III, Count of Hainaut. The Annales Stabulensis report: &quot;&quot;.40 On 1 July 960, Eraclus, bishop of Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge, driven by the fears of the time, granted the monks a location to build a refuge in Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge. Five years earlier, the victory of emperor Otto I over the Hungarians at Lechfeld proved the danger from Hungarian sack.41
 The key building period at the abbey of Stavelot corresponds to the rule of prince-abbot Poppo of Deinze, the second founder of the abbey,42 who was made abbot by Holy Roman Emperor Henry II in 1020.43 He built an imposing church over  in length, which was consecrated in the presence of Emperor Henry III on 5 June 1040.44 As well as confirming the authenticity of the relics of St Quirinus at Malmedy in 1042,45 Poppo revived the cult of St Remaclus. Poppo died in 1048; his cult, which began almost immediately,46 focused on his resting place in the crypt. Thietmar was the lay patron who assembled carpenters and stone masons to build the abbey church.47 Malmedy developed around the monastery; until the end of the tenth century, the villagers used the chapel of Saint Laurent, an apsidiole of the abbey church, as their place of worship.48
In 1065, controversy arose when Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne, named Tegernon of Brauweiler abbot of Malmedy, on dubious authority &lt;U+2014&gt; whilst Malmedy was in the archdiocese of Cologne, the two abbeys were linked and, thus, under the purview of the diocese of Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge, where Stavelot lay. The monks from Stavelot processed to Malmedy with the crosier and relics of St Remaclus to remind the rebellious monks of the traditional order for the abbeys that the saint had instituted. The relics and crosier were also transported to an Imperial Diet of Henry IV in Goslar. In 1066, they processed again, this time to Aachen and Fritzlar; they processed to Bitburg and Bamberg the following year. That their prayers were not answered apparently led the monks to despair that the relics were becoming impotent or that the monks were being punished by their patron; in 1067 and 1068, abbot Thierry even went to Rome to appeal to Pope Alexander II. This impasse lasted for a further three years, until Henry held court at Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge at Easter in 1071; with great ceremony, the monks processed with Remaclus's relics to meet with his legendary fellow bishop St Lambert, joined en route by the relics of St Symmetrus. Numerous miracles convinced the emperor to recognise the union of the two abbeys and reiterate the superiority of Stavelot, forcing Anno eventually to capitulate. A rejoiceful procession back to Stavelot paused en route to celebrate Mass on the banks of the Meuse, with a great crowd and further mirables. Finally, the monks processed with Remaclus's relics to the abbey at Malmedy, to symbolise the restoration of his and their authority. This series of episodes is recounted in the heroic narrative of the Triumph of St Remaclus and confirmed in several contemporary sources.49
In 1098, Wibald was born in the hamlet of Chevrouheid, near Stavelot. Elected prince-abbot in 1130, he played a key international-level role in the religious life of the region and the abbeys. In 1138, he granted permission for the castle to be built in Logne, first mentioned in an 862 abbey charter.50 In the 12th to 15th centuries, however, the abbacy experienced a slow decline.
Early Modern Age
In 1509, William of Manderscheid organised a procession to induce the recalcitrant county of Logne, a fief of the abbey, to submit to his jurisdiction. The cort&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge was pious, rather than fraught with tension, with Stavelot monks carrying the shrines of Remaclus and Babolene with other reliquaries and the monks of Malmedy with reliquaries of Quirinus, Just, Peter and Philip joined by parishioners from Lierneux with the relics of Symmetrus.51 In 1521, after the castle in Logne had been dismantled, William added &quot;Count of Logne&quot; to the abbots' titles, with the county representing most of the western portion of the principality's territory.52
The abbey church served as a monastic church and as a church of pilgrimage until the French Revolution. Its imposing gatehouse tower was rebuilt in 1534;53 its ground floor is all that remains, though the abbey church has been excavated and its layout is shown on the ground. Malmedy began to flourish particularly in the 16th century with the development of tannery; in 1544 there were only 216 houses with a thousand inhabitants, but that over tripled by 1635.54
After the death of abbot Christopher of Manderscheid, there was a series of absent abbots, including Maximilian Henry of Bavaria (who was also bishop of Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge and of Hildesheim), who reformed the abbey in 1656.lices&quot;/&gt; In the 17th century, Stavelot and Malmedy were major centres of tanning in Europe.ge:Stavelot&quot;/&gt;5556 Other industries also known to Malmedy include cotton manufacturing, manufacture of chess sets, dominoes and gingerbread; papermaking was particularly important to Malmedy, as was the manufacture of gunpowder.5758 In 1659, a Capuchin convent was built in Stavelot.
Despite the abbacy's neutrality and the protection of the prince-abbots, the territory was invaded at least 50 times by troops passing through, whose depredations had disastrous consequences for the population,59 including the 4 October 1689 razing of both Stavelot60 and Malmedy616263 on the orders of Nicolas Catinat, general to Louis XIV of France, during the Nine Years' War.6465 In Stavelot, the entire town, including over 360 houses, was destroyed, leaving just the abbey and its farmyard standing;66 Some 600 out of the 660 houses of the town were destroyed and it took more than a century to completely rebuild Malmedy.67 Malmedy's 1601 city walls had previously been destroyed by French troops in 1658, during the 1635&lt;U+2013&gt;59 Franco-Spanish War.68 The wars, and passage by troops of Brandenburg-Prussia, the Dutch Republic, France and Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge, had cost the principality the sum of 2.75 million Reichsthalers, requiring the abbey to borrow 134 000 thalers from Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge and Verviers; another loan, shared amongst the communities, totalled 109 000 thalers, with annual interest of 14 161 thalers and arrears of 26 000 thalers.tudes historiques&quot;/&gt;
By the start of the 18th century the principality had lost a third of its territory, as a result of war, fires, pillage and unjust encroachments. The deputies to the Reichstag showed that, in the 16th century, the Spanish Netherlands had seized several territories and that the Bishopric of Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge had stolen over half a dozen seigneuries totalling over 2000 households, adding that the principality itself retained only 1693 households, having had 3780 households before the upheavals and that the suffering of the principality had caused some of the richest and most powerful families to emigrate. The Reichstag was moved to halve the Reichsmatrikel for the abbeys (reducing the sums and troops the abbeys needed to provide towards the Imperial army) and exempting any need for the abbeys to send troops to the Imperial army for three years, an exemption extended for four more years on 24 March 1715.tudes historiques&quot;/&gt;
Abolition
During the French Revolutionary Wars, from 1793 to 1804, the abbey was abandoned by the monks and the principality extinguished.69 Stavelot was incorporated to the French Republic by a decree of 2 March 1793, along with Franchimont and Logne.70 Despite opposition from local notables, Malmedy was similarly incorporated by decree of 9 Vend&lt;U+00E9&gt;miaire of the Year IV (1 October 1795).71 Stavelot abbey itself was sacked and the church sold and demolished;7273 of the church just the western doorway remains, as a free-standing tower. Two cloisters &lt;U+2014&gt; one secular, one for the monks &lt;U+2014&gt; survive as the courtyards of the brick-and-stone 17th-century domestic ranges. The foundations of the abbey church are presented as a footprint, with walls and column bases that enable the visitor to visualize the scale of the Romanesque abbey.74
Geography and administration
 Based largely in the Ambl&lt;U+00E8&gt;ve and Ourthe river valleys, the principality took up a substantial proportion of what is now the arrondissement of Verviers in the province of Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge. By the time of the French Revolution, the principality was bounded to the north by the duchy of Limburg, to the south and east by the duchy of Luxembourg and to the north-west by the marquisate of Franchimont and the Condroz.tudes historiques&quot;/&gt; The principality was divided into three administrative districts: the  of Stavelot, the  of Malmedy and the county of Logne, totalling around 28,000 inhabitants.75sching&quot;/&gt;76tudes historiques&quot;/&gt; The  of Stavelot contained 14 communities and that of Malmedy contained the town itself and the  of Waimes and Francorchamps. The county of Logne was divided into four : Hamoir (7 communities), Ocquier (6), Comblain (5) and Louveign&lt;U+00E9&gt; (2), with public assemblies being based in Bernardfagne. In addition, six other communities were exclaves, plus the  of Anthisnes and Vien, in the Confroz. In 1768, these two  were exchanged with Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge for Chooz, Sclessin and Ougr&lt;U+00E9&gt;e.tudes historiques&quot;/&gt;
Several sources note that the two abbeys held disputes between themselves, with Stavelot assuming primacy over Malmedy, to the latter's discontent; new abbots were invested in Stavelot on behalf of both abbeys, however.sching&quot;/&gt;77 Whilst an absolute principality, in some matters the prince-abbot could consult a general assembly or  of clergy, dignitaries, prince's officers, mayors and aldermen, whose main role was to vote for taxes. Each of the three districts had its own provincial assembly and court, with a Princely Council for highly-contested cases; as a court of last resort, citizens could appeal to the Imperial Chamber Court (), created by Emperor Maximilian I (reigned 1508&lt;U+2013&gt;19) on the model of the parliaments in Paris and Mechelen and headquartered in Frankfurt (1495&lt;U+2013&gt;1527), Speyer (1527&lt;U+2013&gt;1693) and Wetzlar (1693&lt;U+2013&gt;1806).78
Shortly before the principality's extinction, it contributed just over 81 Reichsthaler per session to the Imperial economy (for the maintenance of the Imperial Chamber Court), with annual revenues of around 25 000 Rhenish gulden.79sching&quot;/&gt;80
Art
The abbey at Stavelot was one of the leading centres of medi&lt;U+00E6&gt;val artistic production.81 In the mid-12th century the prince-abbot supported a group of goldsmiths and metalworkers that produced champlev&lt;U+00E9&gt; enamels,8283 among whom the name of Godefroid de Claire stands out.84858687 Abbot Wibald (ruled 1130&lt;U+2013&gt;58) was one of the greatest patrons of the arts in the 12th century; the Stavelot Triptych of gilded copper and enamels, which contained two fragments of the True Cross, was produced for the Abbey during his rule (ca 1156) and is now held in The Morgan Library &amp; Museum in New York City.88899091 The binding of the Stavelot Bible (completed in 1097),92 and the remaining fragments from the retable (altar screen) at Stavelot are also high points of medi&lt;U+00E6&gt;val art,93949596 with the Stavelot Bible being described as &quot;a perfect microcosm of the influences and interests that gave rise to the first Romanesque painting&quot;.97
The coat of arms, granted to the town of Stavelot in 1819, is also the coat of arms of the abbey &lt;U+2014&gt; parted fesswise between an image of St Remaclus and the wolf, which in Stavelot's founding legend carried bricks for the building of the abbey after having killed Remaclus's donkey.lices&quot;/&gt;9899
