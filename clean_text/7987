The Rivadavia class was a two-ship ship class group of battleships Spanish: acorazados designed by the American Fore River Shipyard Fore River Shipbuilding Company for the Argentine Navy. Named Ship ARA Rivadavia  2 and Ship ARA Moreno  2 after important figures in Argentine history, they were Argentina's counter to Brazil's two Sclass Minas Geraes battleship 1s.

In 1904, Brazil scrapped a previous naval building program in favor of an order that included two dreadnoughts, despite signs that such an action would spark a South American naval arms race. To counter this acquisition by a major rival, Argentina began call for bids seeking bids for at least two dreadnoughts in 1908. Over the next two years, multiple shipbuilders from five countries vied for the contracts, complemented by efforts from their respective governments. Argentina was able to play this hyper-competitive environment to its own advantage by rejecting all of the initial proposals and calling for new ones that required the best aspects of each. They then repeated this process, despite complaints from shipbuilders that their trade secrets were being given away. The contracts were awarded to the lowest bidder, Fore River, in early 1910. This move shocked the European bidders, but could largely be explained by the American steel trust's ability to produce steel at a much lower cost than any other country.

During their construction, the Argentine battleships were frequently subject of rumors involving their sale to a foreign country, especially after the beginning of the World War I First World War. Under diplomatic pressure not to sell, Argentina kept the two ships. Throughout their careers, Rivadavia and Moreno were based in Puerto Belgrano and served principally as training ships and diplomatic envoys. They were modernized in the United States in 1924 and 1925 and were inactive for much of the World War II Second World War due to Argentina's neutrality. Wiktionary:stricken Struck from the navy lists on 1 February 1957, Rivadavia was ship breaking scrapped in Italy beginning in 1959. Moreno was struck on 1 October 1956 and was towed to Japan in 1957 for scrapping in what was then the world's longest tow 96 days.

 Background 
In 1902, ArgentineChilean territorial disputes over the boundary of Patagonia and control of the Beagle Channel were settled via British mediation. As part of the treaty that ended the dispute, restrictions were placed on the navies of both countries. The British Royal Navy bought two Sclass Swiftsure battleship 0 pre-dreadnought battleships that were being built for Chile, and Argentina sold its two Kasuga class cruiser Rivadavia-class armored cruisers under construction in Italy to Japan.Hore, Battleships of World War I, 91.

By 1904, however, Brazilthe largest country in South America in both size and populationbegan to seriously consider upgrading its navy to compete with Argentina and Chile.Livermore, Battleship Diplomacy, 32. So Paulo state#Early Twentieth Century Soaring demand for coffee and rubber boom rubber brought the Brazilian economy an influx of revenue,Sondhaus, Naval Warfare, 216.Schenia, Brazil, 403. which paid for 1904 $31,250,000#tag:ref Argentines use $ to represent their Argentine peso peso and US$ or similar for the U.S. dollar; however, $ generally means dollar in English sources and in this article. group=N naval repair scheme, a substantial amount for the time period. The bill authorized 28 ships, including three battleships and three armored cruisers. It was not possible to keel laying lay down the battleships until 1906, the same year the trend-setting HMS Dreadnought 1906 6 was constructed.  This ship prompted the Brazilians to cancel their battleship plans in favor of two so-called dreadnoughts. These dreadnoughtsdesigned to carry the heaviest armament in the world at the timehttp://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CE4D9123EE233A2575AC0A96E9C946997D6CF Germany may buy English warships, The New York Times, 1 August 1908, C8. and later described as the last word in heavy battleship design by Scientific AmericanThe Brazilian Battleship Minas Geraes, Scientific American 102, 19 March 1910: 240241. ISSN 0036-8733.came as an abrupt shock to the Argentine and Chilean navies. Historian Robert Schenia comments that those two ships alone outclassed the entire elderly Argentinian fleet.Schenia, Argentina, 400.

Debates raged in Argentina over the wisdom of acquiring dreadnoughts to counter Brazil's. The cabinet was in favor, despite a probable cost of over $9,740,000,#tag:ref In British pounds sterling, these figures are equal to 2,000,000, or 158,000,000 in 2008. The 2008 dollar amount would have been approximately $232,000,000. group=N but a specific plan for two convert 14000 LT t 0 adj=on battleships and ten destroyers was not popular with the public. The American ambassador to Brazil sent a cablegram to the U.S. State Department, warning them of the destabilizing effects that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race.Livermore, Battleship Diplomacy, 3233.

Despite American entreaties to preclude the naval arms race, Brazil continued development on the ships. This, combined with renewed border disputes, particularly in the Ro de la Plata River Plate Ro de la Plata, literally Silver River area, spurred Argentina to move forward with plans for their own battleships. Inflamed by newspaper editors, the public was now fully supportive of a naval building program. While an early plan called for $35,000,000 to be invested$7,000,000 from foreign loansa $55,000,000 plan was adopted in August 1908.#tag:ref In 1904 terms, $7,000,000 is 1,440,000; $35,000,000 is 7,190,000; and $55,000,000 is 11,300,000. In 2008 terms, these numbers are respectively $137,000,000 / 125,000,000;  $687,000,000 / 625,000,000;  and $1,080,000,000 / 982,000,000. group=N Hoping to end the arms race, Argentina made an offer to purchase one of the two Brazilian ships, but the refusal prompted the despatch of an Argentine naval commission to Europe to acquire dreadnoughts.Livermore, Battleship Diplomacy, 33.

Proposals from shipbuilders for two dreadnoughts along with a possible third, to match Brazil should a third ship be ordered and twelve destroyers were solicited in 1908 by Call for bids open tender.Schenia, Argentina, 401.Schenia, Latin America, 82.Whitley, Battleships of World War Two, 18. In order to ensure that the designs reflected the most modern practices, the requirements were intentionally vague.Schenia, Latin America, 83.

Fifteen shipyards from the United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy began bidding on the battleships. Diplomatic pressure to give the contracts was brought to bear from all these countries, especially the first three.Livermore, Battleship Diplomacy, 34.#tag:ref Although the United States had done little to promote American armament interests in Latin America under President Theodore Roosevelt; this was drastically reversed after the election of William Howard Taft in 1912, most notably demonstrated with the creation of the Division of Latin American Affairs and the appointment of Charles H. Sherrill ambassador Charles H. Sherrill to be the United States Ambassador to Argentina American minister to Argentina. As part of this, American bankers were persuaded to offer a $10,000,000 loan to Argentina to help pay for the dreadnoughts should they be built in the United States. group=N Even with this assistance, industry leaders in the United States believed that they had no chance in the bidding without active cooperation from their government, as Europe was the traditional arms supplier to Argentina and to all of South America.Livermore, Battleship Diplomacy, 3536. Even when this was given, including the removal of import tariffs on hides from Argentina, promises for additional concessions if American shipbuilders were selected,Livermore, Battleship Diplomacy, 36. and an offer to include the most technologically advanced fire-control system and torpedo tubes available on the Argentine battleships, the United States was widely viewed as a non-contender. Historian Seward W. Livermore remarked:

quote Opposition to the United States was formidable. The naval commission was pro-British; the vice-president of the republic, Roque Senz Pea, favored Italy, where he had been the Argentine envoy for many years; and the minister of war wanted the contracts to go to Germany, so as to standardize the military and naval equipment of the country.

The president of the Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding Newport News Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company believed that the United States would not receive contracts due to what he saw as a large amount of European meddling in Argentina:

quote The political influence of foreign powers is being exerted in a very forceful manner to turn the business to English and Continental firms; the King of Italy, the German Emperor, and the force of English diplomacy are being made use of; and American firms will have very little consideration, I fear, unless our government will exert some very powerful influence in favor of this country.Quoted in Livermore, Battleship Diplomacy, 35.

The United States, however, found an ally in Buenos Aires' main daily newspaper, La Prensa Buenos Aires La Prensa. The owner, editor, and naval editor were all in favor of acquiring American-designed dreadnoughts. In addition, the paper found evidence of British wrongdoing in a related naval contract. Under public pressure, the naval commission was forced to reconsider its original list, which had placed Italy first and Britain second. It now featured the United States first, Britain second, and Italy last.

In a surprise move, the Argentine naval commission then threw out all of the opening tenders and called for another round of bidding; they simultaneously updated the specifications to include what were judged to be the best aspects of all the plans.Livermore, Battleship Diplomacy, 37. The competitors were given three weeks to come up with new designs and cost estimates. After diplomatic protests, this was modified slightly; the original bids were kept, but alterations to attempt to conform to the new desired characteristics were allowed.#tag:ref While both Schenia and Livermore explicitly state that the commission threw out all the bids twice,Livermore, Battleship Diplomacy, 39. neither makes it clear when this occurred.Livermore only goes into detail about one of these occasions, of which it is not clear if it is the second or third round. group=N

The commission found that the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company bid was lowest on one battleship, and the Fore River Shipyard Fore River Shipbuilding Company was lowest on the other. Despite a British attempt to allow the Armstrong Whitworth-Vickers Limited Vickers team to lower their price by $570,000,#tag:ref This equals 117,000 in 1910, or $9,880,000 / 8,870,000 in 2008. group=N prompt American diplomacy granting various assurances regarding recent events between the United States and Brazil, the upcoming 1910 Pan-American Conference, and a guarantee of American participation in the Argentine centennial celebrations secured the battleship contracts for Fore River on 21 January 1910.Livermore, Battleship Diplomacy, 38.#tag:ref The aforementioned twelve destroyers were divided up between Britain, France, and Germany.http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9803E3D81730E233A25750C2A9679C946196D6CF America to Build Argentine Ships, The New York Times, 23 January 1910, C4. group=N The maximum price Fore River tendered, $10,700,000, underbid the British by more than $973,000.#tag:ref These figures equal 2,190,000 in 1910, or $246,000,000 / 211,000,000 in 2008; 200,000 in 1910, or $22,500,000 / 19,200,000 in 2008. group=N Italy's tender was just $48,600 more, but their ship's displacement ship displacement was convert 2000 LT t 0 smaller, the belt armor was convert 2 in mm thinner, and the top speed was slightly slower.Philip Alger, http://books.google.com/books?id=tiJKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA595#v=onepage&q&f=false Professional Notes; Ships of War, Budgets and Personnel; Argentine Republic, Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute 31, no. 1 1910: 595.#tag:ref $48,600 is equivalent to 10,000 in 1910, or $1,090,000 or 962,000 in 2008. group=N

Rivadavia was built by Fore River at its shipyard in Massachusetts; as called for in the final contract, Moreno was subcontractor subcontracted out to the New York Shipbuilding New York Shipbuilding Corporation of New Jersey. The steel for the ships was largely supplied by the Bethlehem Steel Company of Pennsylvania,http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=EP19100323.2.42 Argentine Navy; Dreadnought Orders, Evening Post, London, 23 March 1910, 4. which, due to their ability to produce steel at a lower price than other nations, was an integral cost-saving measure. The Secretary of the Argentine Naval Commission, the body which chose the final design, said the reason the American tender was lower than that of the English was that steel for construction work and armor-plating is a great deal cheaper in the United States than in England. Wages are higher there, but the contractors ... are able to obtain it more cheaply owing to the manipulations of the Steel Trust.#tag:ref The disparity in cost per ton was quite large units are pounds sterling: American, 78.3; Italian, 85.9; British, 86.3; French, 87.4; and German, 88.2. group=N

A third dreadnought, provided for in the contract, was strongly supported by Argentina and by U.S. diplomats during 1910, while the Minas Geraes class was still under construction. La Prensa and one of its rivals, La Nacin La Argentina, heavily advocated a third ship; the latter even started a petition to raise money for a new battleship.Livermore, Battleship Diplomacy, 44. An American diplomat wrote back to the United States that this newspaper rivalry promises the early conclusion of a movement which means a third battleship whether by public subscription or by Government funds.Quoted in Livermore, Battleship Diplomacy, 44. However, Brazil's 2126 November Revolt of the Whip Revolta da Chibata Revolt of the Whip, in which the three most powerful ships in the fleet the battleships Ship Brazilian battleship Minas Geraes  2, Ship Brazilian battleship So Paulo  2, and the cruiser Ship Brazilian cruiser Bahia  2 along with an older coast defence ship coast defense ship Deodoro violently rebelled, crushed the previous sentiment for a new battleship.Schenia, Latin America, 104107. About two years later in October 1912, a third dreadnought was authorized by Argentina in case Brazil's HMS Agincourt 1913 Rio de Janeiro was completed and delivered. The ship was never named or built, as Rio de Janeiro was sold to the Ottoman Empire and later seized by the British, and another planned Brazilian ship Ship Brazilian battleship Riachuelo  2 was canceled due to the beginning of the World War I First World War.Schenia, Argentina, 402.Schenia, Latin America, 321.

 International reaction 
The choice of Fore River came as a complete surprise to the European bidders. Britain's reaction in particular was scathing: John H. Biles, a naval architect, decried the bidding process as unethicalQuoted in Schenia, Latin America, 83. and remarked:

quote ... it may be presumed that everything  ... good in the first proposals was seized upon by the Argentine authorities and asked for in the new design. This second request went not only to British builders but to all the builders of the world, and in this way it is exceedingly probable that a serious leakage of ideas and practice of our ships was disseminated through the world by the Argentine government.... The third inquiry that was issued showed to all the builders of the world what has been eliminated or modified in the second inquiry; and so the process of leakage went merrily on, and with it that of the education of foreign builders and the Argentine government.Quoted in Schenia, Latin America, 84.

Various British newspapers also cried foul. The Evening Standard believed that as Argentina's greatest creditor and greatest client,Quoted in Livermore, Battleship Diplomacy, 39. Britain ought to have been awarded the two ships. The Times took a different track, accusing American shipbuilders of slashing prices to an obscene degree,#tag:ref Ironically, on 17 January 1909, the New York Herald had opined that the British would eventually win the Argentine contracts by utilizing this practice.Schenia, Latin America, 354. group=N and accusing the government of exerting undue diplomatic pressure to obtain the contracts.

File:ARA Rivadavia speed trials 2.jpg thumb 240px Rivadavia on her speed trials
New Zealand's The Evening Post New Zealand Evening Post noted that the United States had previously built major warships for other countries, including Russia's and Britain's ally Japan, and commented, The severity of the blow to England rests in ... the amount of English capital in Argentina, possibly echoing the Evening Standard's argument. They referred to a startling fact printed by the Daily Mail: the steel used for the armor of the American design was obtained for a much lower price. With Bethlehem's ability to produce it at 8 less per ton than British foundries, a cost savings of more than 10% in steel over the British ship could be realized.

Germany asserted that the United States was given the opportunity to view the other nations' tenders and lower their price accordingly. Germany also alleged that the United States had secured the deal by pledging to come to Argentina's defense should they become embroiled in a military conflict.http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A00E0DC1E31E233A25755C2A9679D946096D6CF Accuse America of Unfair Competition, The New York Times, 26 November 1911, C4.

The New York Times noted that with Argentina's and Brazil's dreadnought orders, countries in North and South America were building the five biggest capital ships in the world Brazil's Rio de Janeiro, Argentina's Rivadavia and Moreno, and the United States' USS New York BB-34 2 and USS Texas BB-35 2 in addition to seven of the ten largest including the United States' USS Wyoming BB-32 2 and USS Arkansas BB-33 2.http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D02E1DD1339E433A25752C1A9649D946196D6CF Our Navy Close to England's Now, The New York Times, 11 December 1910, 8. Shortly after Rivadavia had completed her trials, the U.S. Navy's Board of Inspection and Survey remarked that  she handled remarkably well ... with comparatively minor modifications the vessel would practically meet the requirements of our own vessels.Quoted in Schenia, Argentina, 402. The Board of Inspection was less pleased with the wing turrets, stating that while theoretically the Rivadavia has an ahead and astern fire of six guns, this is not so in reality, as it is almost certain that the blast from the waist turrets would dish in the smokepipes and damage the uptakes.

 Possible sale 
After Brazil sold Rio de Janeiro to the Ottoman Empire, Argentina began to actively seek a buyer for their two ships so the profits could be invested in education. In the tension that preceded the First World War, there were many suitors. The United States, however, abhorred the idea of the their latest technological advances falling into the hands of a possible future combat opponent. While the contract allowed the United States Navy an option to acquire the ships if a deal was reached with a third nation, the navy did not want the ships; with the rapid advances in dreadnought technology, such as the all or nothing armor all or nothing armor arrangement, even new ships like Rivadavia and Moreno were seen as outmoded.Livermore, Battleship Diplomacy, 4546.

Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the Argentine National Congress in the summer of 1914, but all were defeated. Still, soon after the beginning of the First World War, the German ambassador to Argentina alleged to the U.S. State Department that Britain's Royal Navy was going to take over the ships as soon as the ships reached the River Plate, and the British put diplomatic pressure on the United States to try to ensure the ships were not sold to any other country as this new country could in turn sell them to Germany.#tag:ref This was possibly referencing an earlier March 1914 incident where French bankersgiven direction by Russiaoffered Argentina twice the amount they paid for the Rivadavia-class ships so that the ships could be turned over to Greece.Livermore, Battleship Diplomacy, 47. Schenia mentions a 1913 Russian attempt to purchase both Argentine and both Chilean battleships, but gives no specifics.Schenia, Latin America, 355. group=N The United States, worried that its neutrality would not be respected and its technology would be released for study to a foreign country, diplomatically pressured Argentina to keep the ships, which it eventually did.Livermore, Battleship Diplomacy, 4647.

 Specifications 
File:Rivadavia class battleship diagrams Brasseys 1923.jpg thumb 320px Plans for the Rivadavia class published in Brassey's Brassey's Naval Annual Naval Annual, 1923
 General characteristics 
The two ships of the Rivadavia class were convert 594 ft 9 in m length overall overall and convert 585 ft m Length between perpendiculars between perpendiculars. They had a beam nautical beam of convert 98 ft 4.5 in m, a normal draft hull draft of convert 27 ft 8.5 in m, and displacement ship displaced convert 27500 LT t lk=on abbr=off Displacement ship#Normal displacement normally and convert 30100 LT t abbr=off Displacement ship#Full or deep load or loaded displacement at full load. The ships were staffed by 130 officers and about 1000 enlisted men.

 Armament 
The Rivadavia class was equipped with a main battery of twelve 12/50 caliber gun Argentina 12-inch/50 caliber#caliber as measurement of length caliber guns, a secondary battery of twelve 6-inch 155&nbsp;mm/50 and twelve  4-inch 102&nbsp;mm/50 Quick-firing gun QF, and two 21-inch 533&nbsp;mm torpedo tubes.

The 12/50 was a Bethlehem Steel Company Bethlehem development. It was most likely based on the weapon used in the United States' Sclass Wyoming battleship 1, the 12/50 caliber Mark 7 gun. The twelve guns were mounted in six dual turrets. Four turrets were superfire superfiring fore and aft, while the other two were located Glossary of nautical terms#E en echelon in Gun turret#Wing turrets wing turrets. The latter weapons could, in theory, fire on a degree 180 range on their respective sides of the hull and degree 100 on the other, but in reality this was not possible, as the blast damage from the weapons would damage the ship. A more reasonable estimate would be degree 90 on their sides.Tony DiGiulian, http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNARG_12-50_Bethlehem.htm 12/50 30.5 cm Bethlehem, NavWeaps, accessed 11 June 2010.

The 6-inch secondary armament was placed in casemates, with six on either side of the ship. For protection, they were provided with 6&nbsp;inches of armor. The 4-inch weaponry, intended for use against marauding destroyers, was mounted unarmored in various places around the ship, including the main deck, superstructure, and far up near the bow. The torpedo tubes were located underneath the waterline and were loaded in a dedicated compartment.

Full ammunition loads were 1,440 rounds for the 12-inch guns 120 per gun, 3,600 rounds for the 6-inch 300, 5,600 rounds for the 4-inch 350, and 16 torpedoes manufactured by Robert Whitehead Whitehead. To assist the main battery with targeting during a battle, the two ships were equipped with two Barr & Stroud rangefinders that were located above the conning towers.

 Propulsion 
Rivadavia and Moreno used John Brown & Company BrownCurtis geared steam turbines, powered by 18 Babcock & Wilcox boilers and connected to three propellers. With a total output of about convert 40000 shp lk=on, the ships were designed to travel at a maximum speed of convert 22.5 kn lk=on and may have been capable of slightly more. At speeds of convert 11 to 15 kn, their endurance ranged from convert 11000 to 7000 nmi lk=on, respectively. Their fuel was a coaloil mix and the ships carried convert 3900 LT t of the former and convert 590 LT t of the latter.

 Armor 
Typical of American dreadnoughts at the time, the Rivadavia class included substantial armor protection. A convert 12 in mm adj=on belt armor belt was fitted amidships, covering convert 5 ft m above and convert 6 ft m below the designed waterline, gradually decreasing towards the bow and stern to convert 5 in mm and convert 4 in mm, respectively. The gun turrets received heavy armor, including convert 12 in mm on the front, convert 9 in mm on the sides, convert 9.5 in mm on the back, and convert 4 in mm on the top. Deck armor consisted of convert .5 in mm maraging steel medium steel and convert 2 in mm carbon steel nickel steel.

 Influences 
The Rivadavia design was very similar to a 1906 proposal from Fore River for an American dreadnought class.Friedman, U.S. Battleships, 69.#tag:ref The plan from the Bureau of Construction and Repair was selected over that of Fore River and was used for the two Sclass Delaware battleship 6s, USS Delaware BB-28 2 and USS North Dakota BB-29 2.Friedman, U.S. Battleships, 68. group=N This ship would have mounted a main battery of fourteen Convert 12 in mm adj=on guns in dual turrets two Superfire superfiring fore, two Gun turret#Wing turrets wing, and three non-superfiring aft, a secondary battery of twenty 4-inch 102&nbsp;mm guns and four torpedo tubes on a hull of Convert 22000 LT t 0 lk=on that would be capable of Convert 21 kn mph km/h.Friedman, U.S. Battleships, 6869.

Foreign practices also bore a large influence on the design; most were acquired through the unique design process of rejecting multiple bids and calling for the best aspects of each. For example, the superfiring arrangement of the main battery was an American innovation, while the wing turrets were similar to British designs of the time. The secondary battery of 6-inch 152&nbsp;mm guns and the three-shaft system were influenced by German design practices, while the engine and boiler layout was reminiscent of the Italian battleship Ship Italian battleship Dante Alighieri  2.Whitley, Battleships of World War Two, 1920.

Ship ARA Rivadavia  2 was named after Bernardino Rivadavia, the first president of Argentina, and was built by Fore River Shipyard. She was keel laying laid down on 25 May 1910, ship naming and launching launched on 26 August 1911, and completed in December 1914. Moreno was named after Mariano Moreno, a member of the first Argentine government in May 1810, and was built by New York Shipbuilding Corporation.

The ships finally arrived in Argentina in February and May 1915, respectively. From 1915 to 1939, they participated in training exercises, diplomatic cruises, and stints in the reserve fleet, apart from a brief period in the early 1920s, when the Argentine government had the ships modernized in the United States. Both refits included a conversion from coal to fuel oil, a new fire-control system, and other improvements.  Notable voyages included Moreno's visit to Brazil with Argentine president Agustn Pedro Justo aboard in 1933 and a later visit in 1934 to mark the centennial of Brazilian independence; Rivadavia's and Moreno's trip to Europe in 1937, where the two ships visited Brest, France Brest France, Wilhelmshaven, Bremen, and Hamburg Germany between them in addition to Moreno's participation in the British Fleet review Commonwealth realms Spithead Naval Review; and a 1939 visit by both battleships to Brazil with naval cadets embarkeddestroyers were sent from Argentina to escort them home, as the Second World War had broken out during their stay.Whitley, Battleships of World War Two, 2122.

During the war, both ships were mainly inactive due to Argentine neutrality. Rivadavia undertook a last diplomatic cruise to Trinidad, Venezuela, and Colombia in 1946, but both ships were immobile by 1948. Moreno was stricken from the naval register on 1 October 1956 and was brought to Japan in 1957 for ship breaking scrapping in a then-world-record 96-day tow. Rivadavia was stricken on 1 February 1957 and scrapped in Italy beginning in 1959.96 Day Tow, The New York Times, 18 August 1957, 61.
