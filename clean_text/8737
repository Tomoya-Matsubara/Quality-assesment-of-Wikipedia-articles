Emanuel David Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili (born 28 July 1977 in Bah&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Blanca, Argentina), better known as Manu Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili, is an Argentine basketball player of Italian descent. Coming from a family of professional basketballers, he is a member of the Argentine national basketball team and the San Antonio Spurs in the National Basketball Association (NBA).
Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili spent the early half of his basketball career in Argentina and Italy, where he won several individual and team honors. His stint with Italian side Kinder Bologna was particularly productive, earning two Lega A Most Valuable Player awards, one Euroleague MVP award and the 2001 League Championship. The San Antonio Spurs drafted the shooting guard as the 57th overall pick in the 1999 NBA Draft, but Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili only joined the Spurs in 2002. He did not take long to establish himself as a key player for the Spurs, and has since won three NBA championships with the Texas side as well as being named an All-Star once.
With the national team, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili has also enjoyed success. He made his d&lt;U+00E9&gt;but in 1998, and was a member of the team which won the goal medal during the 2004 Olympics. Hailed as one of the finest Europe-based players to grace the NBA with his high-tempo and intensive game, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili is also the only basketball player ever to win a Euroleague title, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal.
Family and personal life
Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili comes from a family of basketball players. His older brothers Sebasti&lt;U+00E1&gt;n and Leandro have played professionally in Argentina and Spain respectively, while their father Jorge was a coach at a club in Bah&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Blanca, where Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili learned to play the game.1 Given the proliferation of basketball clubs in Bah&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Blanca and his idolization of Michael Jordan, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili's love for basketball grew rapidly.2
Like many Argentines, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili is a descendant of Italian immigrants, and he has dual citizenship with Argentina and Italy.3 As a result of his travels, he can speak Spanish, Italian and English fluently.4 In his free time, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili enjoys surfing the internet, listening to Latin music, watching movies and relaxing with his friends.5 In 2004, he married Marie Orono.6
Professional career
Argentine and Italian years
Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili made his professional d&lt;U+00E9&gt;but in the Argentine basketball league for the Andino Sport Club team of La Rioja from 1995–1996, and was traded to Estudiantes de Bah&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Blanca the next year.7 He played with his hometown team until the Italian league attracted him, and in 1998 he moved to Europe, spending the 1998&lt;U+2013&gt;1999 and 1999&lt;U+2013&gt;2000 seasons with Basket Viola Reggio Calabria.8 Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili then entered the 1999 NBA Draft and the San Antonio Spurs selected him late in the second round with the 57th overall pick.9 However, he did not sign with the Spurs at this point in time. Instead, he returned to Italy to play for Kinder Bologna, which he helped win the 2001 Italian Championship, the 2001 and 2002 Italian Cups, and the 2001 Euroleague, where he was named Most Valuable Player (MVP).10 He was also named League MVP in 2000&lt;U+2013&gt;01 and 2001&lt;U+2013&gt;02, and made the Italian league's All-Star game three times during this period.11
San Antonio Spurs
 It was not until after the 2002 FIBA World Championship in Indianapolis that Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili joined the Spurs. In that tournament, he made the All-Tournament team alongside future NBA star Yao Ming and established NBA stars Dirk Nowitzki and Peja Stojakovic,12 and helped lead Argentina to a second-place finish.13 In his first season in the NBA, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili played backup for veteran guard Steve Smith.14 He spent much of the early season injured, and found it hard to adjust to the NBA's style of play. As his injury improved, so did Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili, winning the Western Conference Rookie of the Month in March, and being named to the All-Rookie Second Team at the end of the season.15 Still, he only started in five games as the Spurs chalked up a 60-22 regular season win-loss record.1617 The Spurs then entered the playoffs eager to upset favorites Los Angeles Lakers, and this was when Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili rose to prominence.
In contrast to his regular season, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili became an integral part of Gregg Popovich's rotational set up in the playoffs, playing in every game.18 The Spurs eliminated Phoenix and Los Angeles19 and in those games his scoring threat took opponents by surprise, giving them one more thing to cope with against the now highly-favored Spurs. He helped guide them past the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals and then the New Jersey Nets in the Finals,20 securing San Antonio's second ever championship. After the win, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili was named Argentina's top sportsman in the country's main newspaper, Clar&lt;U+00ED&gt;n, and even met Argentine president N&lt;U+00E9&gt;stor Kirchner.21 A gym in Bah&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Blanca was dedicated in Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili's honor as well.22
 In the 2003-04 NBA season, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili began featuring more regularly for the Spurs, starting in half of the 77 regular season games he played in.23 His statistics improved in all major categories, as he averaged 12.8 points, 4.5 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.8 steals per game.24 During the playoffs, the Spurs met perennial rivals Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Semifinals. Following a controversial Game 5 where Derek Fisher scored a buzzer-beating jumpshot,25 the Spurs lost Game 6 and lost the series 2&lt;U+2013&gt;4.26 While Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili did not start in a single playoff game as he did in 2003, his playoff statistics improved significantly, with 13.0 points, 5.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game.27
After some issues with San Antonio over his contract, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili re-signed with the Spurs and he started in every game in the 2004-05 season.28 This was his best season yet as he was selected as a reserve by NBA coaches to the 2005 Western Conference All-Star team, marking his d&lt;U+00E9&gt;but in the elite mid-season showcase.29 During the playoffs, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili's play was pivotal to winning San Antonio's third ever championship. The Spurs first defeated Phoenix 4&lt;U+2013&gt;1 in the Conference Finals,30 before prevailing in a very defensive seven-game series against the Detroit Pistons.31 Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili recorded career-highs in his playoff numbers, most notably 20.8 ppg and 5.8 rpg,32 and had the third highest point total in the entire playoffs.33 In the NBA Finals MVP Award voting, the shooting guard was a candidate but was edged out by teammate and captain Tim Duncan.34 The former finished the 2004-05 season as the second leading scorer on the team.35
 The 2005-06 season was an injury-plagued one for Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili, who suffered foot and ankle injuries that hindered his ability to play. He managed 65 games in the regular season, but saw a dip in major statistics as compared to the previous season.36 During the playoffs, he returned to form, but was unable to prevent the Spurs from being eliminated by the Dallas Mavericks in the Conference Semifinals.37 In the 2006-07 season, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili started in only 36 of 75 games, his second lowest since arriving at San Antonio.38 Despite being second choice to Michael Finley as the starting shooting guard, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili produced numbers closely identical to his successful 2004-05 campaign.39 The 2007 NBA Playoffs saw him help the Spurs to defeat the Denver Nuggets, Phoenix Suns and Utah Jazz, before sweeping the Cleveland Cavaliers to win his third and San Antonio's fourth championship.40

Argentine national team





Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili is a member of the Argentina national basketball team, and made his d&lt;U+00E9&gt;but during the 1998 FIBA World Championship in Athens.41 His best accomplishment as a member of the national team came at the 2004 Athens Olympics when Argentina became the first team other than the United States to win the gold medal in 16 years. His highlight of the tournament was probably his game-winning buzzer beater with 0.7 seconds remaining, on the opening day of the Olympics, in a game versus Serbia and Montenegro.42 Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili was also named the Most Valuable Player of the tournament, as he led the team in both scoring (19.3 ppg) and assists (3.3 apg).43
Player profile

Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili is a 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m), 205 lb (93 kg) shooting guard44 who has been deployed either as a sixth man or starter for the Spurs. He has established himself as a reliable and versatile backcourt presence, and is a relatively late bloomer, entering the NBA at age 25 in a period where entering the NBA as a teenager was very common.45 Alongside teammates Tony Parker and Tim Duncan, he forms one of the centerpieces of San Antonio's game.46
Apart from his up-tempo and aggressive style of play, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili is known for his clutch play.47 This is documented by his numerous European league MVP awards, 2004 Olympic tournament MVP, and his performances in San Antonio's 2004-05 championship-winning campaign. Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili's modus operandi however, is a source of consternation for some of his opponents. A fierce attacker of the basket, he often lowers his head when driving to the basket, and is willing to draw charges on defense.48 He was even listed by ESPN writer Thomas Neumann at #6 on the list of greatest floppers in NBA history.49
But having traversed the major basketball continents in his basketball career, Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili is one of the few players who have enjoyed success under both the physical, one-on-one play of the NBA and the more technical, jumpshooting rule set of the FIBA. He is the only player in basketball history to win the Euroleague, an Olympic gold medal, and an NBA Championship ring.5051 He is also the first non-U.S. player ever to win both the NBA Championship ring and the Olympic gold medal, and only the second Latin American to be selected to play in an NBA All-Star game (after Panama's Rolando Blackman).52 In 2007, ESPN sportswriter John Hollinger even ranked Gin&lt;U+00F3&gt;bili as the sixth best international player in the NBA, describing the 57th draft pick as the &quot;great heist of all time&quot;, and attributed the trend of NBA teams drafting developing European players to the success of the Argentine.53
