Julian, also spelled Julien, is a common male given name in Britain, United States, Ireland, Germany, Poland, France (as Julien) and elsewhere.
The name literally means, in Latin, &quot;belonging to Julius&quot;, hence its use for the Julian calendar introduced by Julius Caesar. Some families have taken it as a female name, possibly due to the influence of the French feminine form, Julienne.
