The Simpsons Movie is a 2007 American animated comedy film based on the animated television series The Simpsons. The film was directed by David Silverman, and stars the regular television cast of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Tress MacNeille and Pamela Hayden. It features Albert Brooks as Russ Cargill, the evil head of the Environmental Protection Agency who intends to destroy Springfield after Homer pollutes the lake. Because the townspeople exile him and his family abandons him, Homer works to redeem his folly by stopping Cargill's scheme.
Previous attempts to create a film version of The Simpsons had failed due to the lack of a script of appropriate length and production crew members. Eventually, producers James L. Brooks, Matt Groening, Al Jean, Mike Scully, and Richard Sakai began development of the film in 2001. A writing team consisting of Scully, Jean, Brooks, Groening, George Meyer, David Mirkin, Mike Reiss, John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, Ian Maxtone-Graham and Matt Selman was assembled. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one developed into a film. The script was re-written over a hundred times, and this creativity continued after animation had begun in 2006. This meant hours of finished material was cut, which included cameo roles from Isla Fisher, Minnie Driver, Erin Brockovich, Edward Norton and Kelsey Grammer. Tom Hanks and Green Day appeared in the final cut as themselves.
Tie-in promotions were made with several companies, including Burger King and 7-Eleven, which transformed selected stores into Kwik-E-Marts. The film premiered in Springfield, Vermont, which had won the right to hold it through a competition organized by Fox. The film was a box office success, grossing over US$526 million. It received a significant majority of positive reviews, with some critics saying it was better than the latter seasons of the show.
Plot
While rock band Green Day are performing on Lake Springfield, the band members fail to engage the audience in a discussion about the environment. They are killed when the pollution in the lake erodes their barge causing it to sink. At a memorial service, Grampa has a prophetic vision, in which he predicts the impending doom of the town. Only Marge takes it seriously though. Lisa and an Irish boy named Colin, whom she has fallen in love with, hold a seminar where they attempt to convince the town to clean up the lake. Meanwhile, Homer adopts a pig rescued from a restaurant, which causes his now neglected son Bart to look to their neighbor, Ned Flanders, as a parental figure. Homer stores the pig's feces in an overflowing silo, which horrifies Marge, and she tells him to dispose of it safely. However, Homer gets distracted and instead dumps the silo in the lake, critically polluting it. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated. Nearby, Flanders and Bart discover the squirrel during a hike, and the EPA captures it. Russ Cargill, head of the EPA, presents five options to President Schwarzenegger, who randomly picks the action of enclosing Springfield in a giant glass dome. When the police discover Homer's silo in the lake, an angry mob of townspeople approach the Simpsons' home. The family escapes through a sinkhole in Maggie's sandbox and flee to Alaska.
Cracks start to appear in the dome and Cargill, not wanting news of what he has done to become widespread, plans to destroy Springfield. In Alaska, the Simpsons see an advertisement for a new Grand Canyon to be located on the site that was Springfield. Marge and the kids decide to go and save the town, but Homer refuses to help the people who tried to kill them. The family abandon Homer and leave but are captured by the EPA and placed back in the dome. After a visit from a mysterious Inuit shaman, whom Homer calls &quot;boob lady&quot;, Homer, while hallucinating, has an epiphany that he must save the town in order to save himself. Just as he arrives at Springfield to do so, a helicopter lowers a bomb suspended by rope through a hole in the dome. Homer climbs to the peak of the dome and descends the rope, knocking the escaping townspeople and bomb off. Homer grabs the bomb and a motorcycle. After reuniting with Bart, they cycle up the side of the dome and Bart throws the bomb through the hole, seconds before detonation. The bomb explodes, shattering the dome. The town praises Homer, who rides off with Marge on the motorcycle into the sunset. The townspeople begin restoring Springfield back to normal.
Production
Development
The production staff had considered a film adaptation of The Simpsons since early in the series. The show's creator, Matt Groening, felt a feature length film would allow them to increase the show's scale and animate sequences too complex for a TV series.1 He intended the film to be made after the show ended, &quot;but that [...] was undone by good ratings&quot;.2 There were attempts to adapt the fourth season episode &quot;Kamp Krusty&quot; into a film, but difficulties were encountered in expanding the episode to feature-length.3 For a long time the project was held up. There was difficulty finding a story that was sufficient for a film, and the crew did not have enough time to complete such a project, as they already worked full time on the show.4 Groening also expressed a wish to make Simpstasia, a parody of Fantasia; it was never produced, partly because it would have been too difficult to write a feature-length script.5 Before his death, Phil Hartman had said he had wished to make a live action Troy McClure film, and several of the show's staff had expressed a desire to help create it.6



&quot;If every episode of The Simpsons is a celebration, which we try to make it, then the movie is like a big celebration. It's a way of honoring the animators, allowing them to really strut their stuff and really go as far as they can with the art of the handwritten gesture. It's a way of honoring the writers, because we were able to get the best all-star writers of The Simpsons and write our hearts out, and it's a way of honoring all the great actors.&quot;


&lt;U+2014&gt; Matt Groening7



The voice cast was signed on to do the film in 2001,8 and work then began on the script.9 The producers were initially worried that creating a film would have a negative effect on the series, as they did not have enough crew to focus their attention on both projects. As the series progressed, additional writers and animators were hired so that both the show and the film could be produced at the same time.10 Groening and James L. Brooks invited back Mike Scully and Al Jean (who continued to work as showrunner on the television series) to produce the film with them.11 They then signed David Silverman (who, in anticipation of the project, had quit his job at Pixar) to direct the film.12 The &quot;strongest possible&quot; writing team were assembled, with many of the writers from the show's early seasons being chosen.13 David Mirkin, Mike Reiss, George Meyer, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti were selected. Ian Maxtone-Graham and Matt Selman joined later, and Brooks, Groening, Scully, and Jean also wrote parts of the script.14 Sam Simon did not return having left the show over creative differences in 1993. Former writer Conan O'Brien wanted to work with the Simpsons staff again, joking that &quot;I worry that the Simpsons-writing portion of my brain has been destroyed after 14 years of talking to Lindsay Lohan and that guy from One Tree Hill, so maybe it's all for the best.&quot;15 The same went for director Brad Bird who said he had &quot;entertained fantasies of asking if [he] could work on the movie&quot;, but did not have enough time due to work on Ratatouille.16 The producers arranged a deal with Fox that would allow them to abandon production of the film at any point if they felt the script was unsatisfactory.17
Work continued on the screenplay from 2003 onwards,18 taking place in the small bungalow where Groening first pitched The Simpsons in 1987.19 The writers spent six months discussing a plot,20 and each of them offered sketchy ideas.21 Jean suggested the family rescue manatees, which became the 2005 episode &quot;Bonfire of the Manatees&quot;, and there was also a notion similar to that of The Truman Show where the characters discovered their lives were a TV show. Groening rejected this, as he felt that the Simpsons should &quot;never become aware of themselves as celebrities&quot;.22 Groening read about a town that had to get rid of pig feces in their water supply, which inspired the plot of the film.23 The decision for Flanders to have in an important role also came early on, as Jean wished to see Bart wonder what his life would be like if Flanders were his father.24 Having eventually decided on the basic outline of the plot for the film, the writers then separated it into seven sections. Jean, Scully, Reiss, Swartzwelder, Vitti, Mirkin, and Meyer wrote 25 pages each, and the group met one month later to merge the seven sections into one &quot;very rough draft&quot;.25 The film's script was written in the same way as the television series: the writers sitting around a table, pitching ideas and trying to make each other laugh.26 The script went through over 100 revisions.27 Groening described his desire to also make the film dramatically stronger than a TV episode, saying that he wanted to &quot;give you something that you haven't seen before&quot;.28
Animation
 Animation for the film began in January 2006,29 with the Itchy &amp; Scratchy short being the first scene to be storyboarded.30 Groening rejected making either a live action or a CGI film,31 calling the film's animation &quot;deliberately imperfect&quot; and &quot;a tribute to the art of hand-drawn animation&quot;.32 The film was produced in a widescreen 2.35:1 aspect ratio, to distinguish it from the look of the television series,3334 and colored with the largest palette the animators had ever had available to them.35 A lot of the animation was produced using Wacom Cintiq tablets, which allowed images to be drawn directly onto a computer monitor to facilitate production.36 Animation production work was divided among four studios around the world: Film Roman in Burbank, California, Rough Draft Studios in Glendale, California, and AKOM and Rough Draft Korea in Seoul, South Korea. Like the television series, the storyboarding, characters, background layout and animatic parts of production, were done in America. The overseas studios completed the animation, in-betweening and digital ink and paint processes.37
Director David Silverman said that unlike the TV series where &quot;you [have] to pick and choose&quot;, the film gave them the opportunity to &quot;lavish that attention [on] every single scene&quot;. The characters have shadows, unlike in the show.38 Silverman and the animators looked to films such as The Incredibles, Triplets of Belleville, and Bad Day at Black Rock for inspiration, as they were &quot;a great education in staging because of how the characters are placed&quot;.39 They also looked for ideas for a dream sequence, in Disney films such as Dumbo and the Pluto cartoon Pluto's Judgment Day,40 and for crowd scenes in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.41 Silverman looked at some of the Simpsons episodes he had directed, primarily his two favorites, &quot;Homie the Clown&quot; and &quot;Three Men and a Comic Book&quot;.42 Mike B. Anderson, Lauren MacMullan, Rich Moore, and Steven Dean Moore each directed the animation for around a quarter of the film under Silverman's supervision, with numerous other animators working on scenes.43
Casting
For inspiration for the crowd scenes in the film, the production staff spent a long time looking at a poster that featured more than 320 Simpsons characters.44 Groening said they tried to include every single character in the film, with 98 having speaking parts,45 and most members of the crowds being previously established characters instead of generic people.46 The series' regular voice actors: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, and Harry Shearer, as well as semi-regular performers Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden, Marcia Wallace, Maggie Roswell, Russi Taylor and Karl Wiedergott, reprised their roles.47 Joe Mantegna returned as Fat Tony,48 while Albert Brooks, who supplied many guest voices in episodes, was hired as Russ Cargill,49 after he told the staff that he wanted to be part of the film.50 For &quot;about a week&quot;, he was to reprise the role of Hank Scorpio from the episode &quot;You Only Move Twice&quot;, but the staff felt that creating a new character was a better idea.51  The cast did the first of three table readings in May 2005,5253 and began recording every week from June 2006 until the end of production.54 James L. Brooks directed them for the first time since the television show's early seasons. Castellaneta found the recording sessions &quot;more intense&quot; than recording the television series, and &quot;more emotionally dramatic&quot;.55 Some scenes, such as Marge's video message to Homer, were recorded over one hundred times, leaving the voice cast exhausted.56
The writers had written the opening concert scene without a specific band in mind. Green Day were cast in that role having requested to guest star in the show. Tom Hanks also appears as himself in the film and accepted the offer after just one phone call.57 Everybody Loves Raymond creator Philip Rosenthal provides the voice of the father in the &quot;new Grand Canyon&quot; commercial with Hanks.58 Due to time restraints, several guests who had recorded parts were cut from the film. Minnie Driver recorded the part of a patronizing grievance counselor in a scene that ended up being cut.59 Edward Norton recorded the part of the man who gets crushed as the dome is implemented, performing a Woody Allen impression. The staff felt the voice was too distracting, so Castellaneta re-recorded Norton's dialogue with a different voice.60 Isla Fisher and Erin Brockovich also recorded cameos, but their scenes were cut.61 Kelsey Grammer recorded lines for Sideshow Bob, who was to appear at several different points,6263 but these scenes were also cut.64 Johnny Knoxville was also touted as a possible guest star.65
Although he does not provide the voice, Arnold Schwarzenegger is President of the United States in the film. He was chosen instead of the incumbent President George W. Bush because then, &quot;in two years [...] the film [would be] out of date&quot;.66 Brooks was nervous about the idea, noting that &quot;[Schwarzenegger's] opinion polls were way down&quot;, he said that they &quot;were [hoping] he'd make a political comeback&quot;.67 The animators began by drawing an accurate caricature of Schwarzenegger,68 but one of the staff instead suggested an altered version of recurring character Rainier Wolfcastle as President.69 This idea was developed, with the design of Wolfcastle, himself also a caricature of Schwarzenegger, being given more wrinkles under his eyes and a different hairstyle.70
Editing
Every aspect of the film was constantly analyzed, with storylines, jokes and characters regularly being re-written.71 Although most animated films do not make extensive changes to the film during active production due to budget restrictions,72 The Simpsons Movie crew continued to edit their film into 2007, with some edits taking place as late as May, two months before the film was released.73 James L. Brooks noted, &quot;70 percent of the things in [one of the trailers]—based on where we were eight weeks ago—are no longer in the movie.&quot;74 Groening said that enough material for two more movies was cut.75 Various new characters were created, and then cut because they did not contribute enough.76 Originally Marge was the character who had the prophetic vision in church. The writers however considered this to be too dark and it was changed to Grampa.77 The role of Lisa's love interest Colin was frequently revised. He was previously named Dexter and Adrien, and his appearance was completely altered.78 One idea was to have Milhouse act as Lisa's love interest, but the writers realized &quot;the audience was not as familiar with [his] long-standing crush on [Lisa] as [they had] thought&quot;.79 A car chase in which Homer throws flaming mummies out of a truck at the EPA was replaced with &quot;more emotional and realistic&quot; scenes at the motel and carnival that allowed for a change of pace.80
Further changes were made after the March 2007 preview screenings of the film in Portland, Oregon and Phoenix, Arizona.81 This included the deletion of Kang and Kodos heavily criticizing the film during the end credits.82 A lot of people at the screenings found the original film too coarse, and some of Homer's behavior too unkind, so several scenes were toned down to make him appear nicer.83 Russ Cargill was re-designed several times, originally appearing as an older man whose speech patterns Albert Brooks based on Donald Rumsfeld. The older model was the one used by Burger King for the action figure.84 Cargill's scene with Bart and Homer at the film's conclusion was added in to fully resolve his story, and the &quot;Spider-Pig&quot; gag was also a late addition.85 One excised scene, before the dome is put over Springfield, had Mr. Burns reminding viewers that it was the last point in the film that they could get a refund.86 Other deletions included Homer's encounter with a sausage truck driver, a scene with Plopper the pig at the end,87 and several musical numbers that appeared throughout.88 A news report, showing the dome's effect on daily life in Springfield in areas such as farming and sport, was cut because it did not fit the overall context of the film.89
Music

James L. Brooks chose Hans Zimmer to compose the film's score, as they were good friends and regular collaborators.90 Zimmer felt that the score was a &quot;unique challenge&quot;, and he had to &quot;try and express the style of The Simpsons without wearing the audience out&quot;.91 He used Danny Elfman's original opening theme, but did not wish to overuse it. He created themes for each member of the family. Homer's leitmotif was a major focus, and Zimmer also composed smaller themes for Bart and Marge.92 Regular television series composer Alf Clausen was not asked to score the film, noting: &quot;sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug&quot;.93
In addition to their appearance in the film, Green Day recorded its own version of the Simpsons theme, and released it as a single.94 Zimmer turned the Spider-Pig song into a choral piece, which was a joke he never intended to be put into the film. Zimmer also had to write foreign-language lyrics for the thirty-two dubbed versions of the song when the film was released internationally. He found translating the song into Spanish the hardest to write. The same choir learned to sing the piece for each of the foreign-language dubs.95
Cultural references
Several cultural references and allusions are made throughout the film. Green Day play &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot; on violins as their barge sinks, a reference to the film Titanic.96 When Bart is riding his skateboard naked, different passing objects are constantly covering his genitalia, a nod to similar techniques used in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.97 Homer and Marge's love scene parodies many Disney films, with Disney-style animals helping them undress.98 Originally, the music from The Wizard of Oz was used in that scene, and the fawn had white spots; these were removed because the animators felt it resembled Bambi too clearly.99 Bart impersonates Mickey Mouse on the train, calling himself &quot;the mascot of an evil corporation&quot;.100 Homer plays Grand Theft Walrus, an allusion to the video game series Grand Theft Auto. In the game, his character shoots a tap-dancing penguin in reference to Happy Feet.101 The &quot;Spider-Pig&quot; song is a parody of the theme song of the 1967 Spider-Man TV series,102 and the name of Lisa's lecture is An Irritating Truth, a play on Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth.103 The bomb disposal robot was based on Vincent D'Onofrio's character Leonard &quot;Pyle&quot; Lawrence from the film Full Metal Jacket, who commits suicide in a similar way.104 At the end of the film, the crowd's celebration is similar to the conclusion of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, with Carl performing the exact same hand gestures as Lando Calrissian.105
The $1000 Homer received when entering Alaska is a reference to the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend.106 As Homer leaves Eski-Moe's he grabs on to a passing truck and uses it to propel himself back to the house, a tribute to actor Buster Keaton,107 while the epiphany features homages to the film Brazil and the works of Salvador Dali.108 Hillary Clinton appears as Itchy's vice president, while an Orc from The Lord of the Rings appears in the mob scene.109 A scene that was cut had Marge and the kids appear on the TV talk show The View to spread the news of Springfield's impending doom. Parts were written for the show's entire panel, the scene was planned to feature Russ Cargill having a gunfight with Joy Behar.110 Another dropped scene featured Moe describing Springfield's varying physical states inside the dome, one of which was the Disneyland ride Autopia.111 There are several references to events in the Simpsons TV series. These include the wreckage of the ambulance from the episode &quot;Bart the Daredevil&quot; crashed into a tree next to Springfield Gorge .112 The Carpenters' song &quot;(They Long to Be) Close to You&quot; was used in Homer and Marge's wedding video and had also been used in several emotional moments between them in the TV series.113
Themes
 Al Jean described the film's message as being &quot;a man should listen to his wife&quot;. In addition, the film parodies two major contemporary issues, religion and environmentalism.114 The theme of environmentalism is present in Homer's polluting of Lake Springfield, Green Day's cameo, and Lisa and Colin's romance. The villainous Russ Cargill is head of the EPA.115 Reviewer Ed Gonzalez argued the plot was a satire of the government's reaction to the effects of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans.116 Ian Nathan of Empire magazine criticized this focus, believing it gave the film an &quot;overt political agenda [which] border[s] on polemic&quot;.117
Religion is focused on in Grampa's momentary possession, and Marge believing what he said to be a message from God.118 Groening joked the film &quot;posit[s] the existence of a very active God&quot;, when asked if he believed it was likely to offend.119 Mark I. Pinsky, author of The Gospel According to The Simpsons, said the film &quot;treats genuine faith with respect, while keeping a sharp eye out for religious pretension and hypocrisy of all kinds&quot;. Regarding the scene where the tenants of Moe's Tavern and the Church switch locations, he believed it took the &quot;chance to unmask everyone's human fallibility.&quot; In analyzing the role of Ned Flanders, he wrote, &quot;It is [the] willingness of The Simpsons to depict all the different sides of us [...] that makes it so rich and funny on our complicated, relationship with religion.&quot;120 The animators inserted an apple tree behind Lisa and Colin during their initial meeting, a reference to the biblical story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Trees were implemented in every important or emotional scene throughout the film.121
Release
 20th Century Fox announced on April 1 2006 that the film would be released worldwide on July 27, 2007.122 The film was released a day earlier in Australia and the United Kingdom.123124 Little information about the plot was released in the weeks building up to the film's release. Groening did not feel that &quot;people look in the TV section of the newspaper and think, 'I'll watch this week's Simpsons because I like the plot.' You just tune in and see what happens.&quot;125
Fox held a competition between 16 Springfields across the United States to host the American premiere.126 Each Springfield produced a film, explaining why their town should host the premiere, with the results being decided via a vote on the USA Today website.127 Springfield, Minnesota dropped out on May 31 2007. 128 The winner was announced on July 10 to be Springfield, Vermont.129 The city beat Springfield, Illinois by 15,367 votes to 14,634. Each of the other 14 entrants held their own smaller screenings of the film on July 26.130 Springfield, Vermont hosted the world premiere of the film on July 21 with a yellow carpet instead of the traditional red.131
The film was rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for &quot;irreverent humor throughout&quot;.132 The production staff had expected this rating.133 However, the British Board of Film Classification passed the film as a PG with no cuts made.134 A BBFC spokeswoman said regarding Bart's brief nude scene, &quot;natural nudity with no sexual content is acceptable in PG films&quot;.135
Marketing
 The convenience store chain 7-Eleven transformed 11 of its stores in the U.S. and one in Canada into Kwik-E-Marts, at the cost of approximately $10 million.136137 7-Eleven also sold Simpsons-themed merchandise in many of its stores. This included &quot;Squishees&quot;, &quot;Buzz Cola&quot;, &quot;Krusty-O's&quot; Cereal and &quot;Pink Movie Donuts&quot;.138 This promotion resulted in a 30% increase in profits for the altered 7-Eleven stores.139 Homer performed a special animated opening monologue for the July 24 2007 edition of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, as part of another promotion.140
Promotions also occurred around the world. The village of Springfield in Canterbury, New Zealand erected a &quot;giant pink donut&quot; to celebrate being named Springfield.141 In Dorset, England, an image of Homer was painted next to the hill figure, the Cerne Abbas giant. This caused outrage amongst local neopagans who performed &quot;rain magic&quot; to try and get it washed away.142
McFarlane Toys released a line of action figures based on the film,143 EA Games released The Simpsons Game, to coincide with the film's DVD release, although the plot of the game was not based on the film.144145 Samsung released a The Simpsons Movie phone,146 and Microsoft produced a limited edition The Simpsons Movie Xbox 360.147 Ben &amp; Jerry's created a Simpsons-themed beer and donut-flavored ice cream, entitled &quot;Duff &amp; D'oh! Nuts&quot;.148 Windows Live Messenger presented their users with the opportunity to download a free animated and static content for use within their conversations.149 Burger King produced a line of Simpsons toy figures that were given away with children's meals, and ran a series of Simpsons-themed television adverts to promote this.150 JetBlue Airways held a series of online sweepstakes to a win trip to the film's Los Angeles, California premiere. They also included a channel dedicated to The Simpsons on their planes' inflight entertainment system.151
Home release
The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc worldwide on December 3, 2007 and on December 18, 2007 in the U.S. It contains commentary tracks from both the writers and animators, six deleted scenes and a selection of material used to promote the film release.152 An unfinished deleted scene of the townspeople singing the Springfield Anthem was also included on The Simpsons The Complete Tenth Season DVD boxset.153
Promotions for the DVD release occurred across the U.S. The Empire State Building was turned yellow, the first time the building had ever been used as part of a film promotion.154 In the UK, Fox launched a &lt;U+00A3&gt;5 million advertising campaign.155 They also signed a &lt;U+00A3&gt;1.6 million deal with the yoghurt company Yoplait, to produce a The Simpsons Movie design for their brand Frubes.156 In its first week it topped the U.S. DVD chart, and generated $11.8 million in rental revenue.157 As of February 24 2008 the domestic DVD rental grossings stand at $56.72 million.158
Reception
Box office performance
The film earned $30.7 million on its opening day in the U.S. making it the 16th-highest, and third-highest non-sequel opening day revenue of all time.159 It grossed a combined total of $74 million in its opening weekend, putting it at the top of the box office,160 and making it the fourth-highest revenue of all time, for an opening weekend in July, and highest among non-sequels.161 This outperformed the expectations of $40 million that Fox had for the release.162
It set several American box office records, including highest grossing opening weekend for a non-CG animated film and for a film based on a television series, surpassing Mission Impossible II. It was also the third-highest grossing opening weekend for an animated film.163 It opened at the top of the international box office taking $96 million from 71 overseas territories, including $27.8 million in the UK, the second-highest UK opening ever for a 20th Century Fox film.164 It contributed to over half of the record 5.5 million people attending British cinemas that weekend.165 In Australia, it grossed AU$13.2 million, the third-highest opening weekend in the country, and the highest for an animated film.166 The United Kingdom is the highest-grossing country for the film outside the US, with Germany in second place with a $36,289,250 grossing overall.167 The film closed with a worldwide gross of over $526 million.168
Critical reception
The film garnered an 89% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with 155 of a total 175 reviews being determined as positive. 169 It received a rating of 80 out of 100 (signifying &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;) on Metacritic from 36 reviews.170 British newspapers The Guardian and The Times both gave the film four out of five stars. The Times' James Bone said that it &quot;boasts the same sly cultural references and flashes of brilliance that have earned the television series a following that ranges from tots to comparative literature PhDs&quot;.171 The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw stated that it &quot;gives you everything you could possibly want&quot; and that he thought, &quot;Eighty-five minutes [was] not long enough to do justice to 17 years of comedy genius&quot;.172 Ed Gonzalez praised the film for its political message, likening the Itchy &amp; Scratchy cartoon at the beginning to President Schwarzenegger's situation later on, as well as the film's visual gags.173 Randy Shulman praised the cast, and described them as having &quot;elevated their vocal work to a craft that goes way beyond simple line readings&quot;, and particularly praised Kavner who he said &quot;gave what must be the most heartfelt performance ever&quot;.174 Roger Ebert gave a positive review, but admitted he was &quot;generally [not] a fan of movies spun off from TV animation&quot;. He called it &quot;radical and simple at the same time, subversive and good-hearted, offensive without really meaning to be&quot;.175 Richard Corliss of Time said that the film &quot;doesn't try to be ruder or kinkier, just bigger and better&quot;.176
USA Today film critic Claudia Puig said that the story did &quot;warrant a full-length feature, thanks to a clever plot and non-stop irreverent humor&quot;, but that some fans may &quot;miss seeing their favorite characters&quot;.177 Patrick Kolan believed that the film was &quot;easily the best stuff to come [from the Simpsons] since season 12 or 13&quot; and praised the animation, but also said that the appearances of characters such as Comic Book Guy and Seymour Skinner were &quot;small and unfunny&quot;.178 Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film's good nature, stating that the laughs &quot;come in all sizes&quot;, but also noted that, &quot;little has been gained bringing the Simpsons to the screen.&quot;179
Variety's Brian Lowry called it &quot;clever, irreverent, satirical and outfitted&quot; but that it was &quot;just barely&quot; capable of sustaining a running time longer than a television episode.180 Lisa Schwarzbaum praised the voice cast but stated that the &quot;'action' sequences sometimes falter&quot;.181 When comparing the film to the early episodes of the show, Stephen Rowley concluded that the film &quot;has more going for it than the show in its later years, but is still a long way short of what made it so invigorating&quot;.182
Negative reception came from the magazine Empire, where reviewer Ian Nathan compared the film to New Coke, saying that &quot;it utterly failed&quot;.183 Phil Villarreal believed that there were &quot;too few laugh-worthy moments&quot; and that &quot;instead of stretching to new frontiers, the film rests on the familiar&quot;.184 Sheila Johnston criticized the pacing of the film and its joke level saying that &quot;the overall momentum flags at times&quot; and that it was &quot;a salvo of comic squibs, some very funny, others limp&quot;.185 David Edwards agreed with this, writing that although &quot;there's a great half-hour show rattling around&quot;, &quot;the rest is padding at its very dullest&quot;.186 Cosmo Landesman believed, &quot;the humour seem[ed] to have lost its satirical bite and wit&quot; and that &quot;much of the comedy is structured around the idiocy of Homer&quot;.187 Bruce Newman criticized the fleeting appearances of many of the show's secondary characters, and found the film to be &quot;a disappointment&quot;.188
