The lumia (Citrus &lt;U+00D7&gt; limon var. 'Lumia') is also called the pear lemon (Citrus x lumia 'pyriformis'), remarking it's shape that resembles a pear. It is also called French lime and sometimes sweet lemon, even-though it is not necessarily sweet. The fruit resembles a pear in shape, has a thick peel and is not very juicy. It can grow to a formidable size. 
Origin and Genetics
The most known origin for the Lumia is from the Mediterranean basin.  A group of scientists working in the University of Catania, Italy has shown by studying its chromosomes that the Pear lemon was first a hybrid of pommelo and citron, which then hybridized with regular lemon. Pear lemon is sometimes classified as a citron hybrid, thanks to it's thick peel and dryness of pulp.
In University of California, Riverside they call it Citrus &lt;U+00D7&gt; limon L. Burm.f., with conflicting reports if it's acidic or not.
Varieties
The Lumia is also classified as: Citrus limon var. lumia Swingle and Citrus medica L. var. lumia.
There is variety of Lumia called Adam's apple or Pomme D'Adammo, and is also included under the name Citrus lumia, according to Risso &amp; Poit, the variety name is pomum adami. Pomme D'Adammo is of the same kind but a more rounded form.
Cultivated varieties includes: Born&lt;U+00E9&gt;o (Indonesia), Balaingue, Bitrouni and Otrodj (Iran).
Chemistry
According to a Japanese study of 1996, the albedo extract of the Lumia, was shown to possess the highest inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenase (IC50 = 24 &lt;U+03BC&gt;g/mL), among other citrus studies. Flavedo extract of ripe Lumia inhibited cyclooxygenase to the same degree as the albedo, more than the pulp extract.1
