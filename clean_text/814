Between 1879 and 1885 the Natal Government Railways placed thirty-seven 4-6-0T tank steam locomotives in service. In 1912 fifteen of these locomotives were assimilated into the South African Railways, later renamed Spoornet and then Transnet Freight Rail, renumbered and reclassified to Class C.1
Origin
When the Natal Government took over all the assets of the Natal Railway Company in 1875 and formed the Natal Government Railways (NGR), two important decisions were made. The first was to convert the railway from Standard gauge to Cape gauge to conform to the gauge used by the Cape Government railways. The second was to extend the tracks inland from Durban to Pietermaritzburg in order to open up the line into the interior, and to Verulam on the North Coast and Isipingo on the South Coast to serve the growing farming communities up and down the coast from Durban.2
The first Cape gauge locomotives of the NGR were a pair of 2-6-0T tank locomotives, built by Kitson and Company, that were taken over from Wythes and Jackson Limited, the contractors who were appointed in 1876 to build the line between Durban and Pietermaritzburg. These two engines were followed by seven similar locomotives that were ordered from Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1877 to meet the expected traffic demands on these new lines.3
Manufacturers
The NGR Class K&amp;S 4-6-0T tank locomotive was a development of those first NGR Cape gauge 2-6-0T tank locomotives. They were known as the Class K&amp;S after their builders, Kitson and Robert Stephenson and Company, who delivered altogether thirty-seven of them between 1879 and 1884.45
The first fifteen were built by Kitson and were delivered in four batches between 1879 and 1882. The next nineteen were built by Stephenson and were delivered in three batches between 1882 and 1884. In 1885 the last three were delivered by Kitson. Their builders, years built and works numbers are set out in the table below.6
Modifications
Two of these locomotives were modified by W. Milne, who was appointed as Locomotive Superintendent of the NGR in 1877. Number 21 was rebuilt to a 4-6-4T wheel arrangement in 1896, for use on the South Coast line. At the time there were no turntables available on this line and the modification was made to enable the locomotive to run equally well in either direction.7
In 1901 number 25 was rebuilt to a 4-6-2T wheel arrangement. The NGR renumbered these two locomotives 39 and 38 respectively.8
Renumbering
Twelve of the remaining unmodified Class K&amp;S locomotives were also renumbered by the NGR, as set out in the table below.9
Reclassification
When the various colonial railroads were amalgamated into the South African Railways (SAR) in 1912, the fifteen unmodified survivors of the 4-6-0T Class K&amp;S locomotives became the SAR&lt;U+2019&gt;s Class C and were renumbered 62 to 76.1011

Service
In NGR service the Class K&amp;S replaced the slightly smaller Beyer, Peacock and Company built 2-6-0T tank locomotives on main line trains out of Durban, occasionally being equipped with small four wheeled tenders to increase their fuel carrying capacity when they were required to work long distances. In SAR service they were used as shunters until the last one was withdrawn from service in 1940.12
In post SAR service one of them, ex SAR number 62, remained in service with the Electricity Supply Commission (Eskom) until the mid 1980s, by which time it had rendered more than one hundred and five years of service. It was named &lt;U+201C&gt;Kitson&lt;U+201D&gt; while in Eskom service and was declared a national monument in 1983.1314
