&quot;Underneath&quot; is the twelfth episode of the ninth season of the American science fiction television series The X-Files. The episode first aired in the United States on March 31, 2002 on the Fox network. The episode was written and directed by executive producer John Shiban. The episode is a &quot;Monster-of-the-Week&quot; story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 4.4 and was viewed by 4.64 million households and 7.3 million viewers. It received mixed reviews from critics.
The show centers on FBI special agents John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Doggett is determined to find an error in the DNA evidence that freed the convicted Robert Fassl, the &quot;Screwdriver Killer&quot;, whom he nearly caught in the act 13 years earlier. In the end, it is revealed that Fassl has a mental condition that splits him into two parts: the religious innocent and the vengeful killer.
&quot;Underneath&quot; marked the directoral debut of Shiban, who had been a writer for series for several seasons. Although &quot;Underneath&quot; was the twelfth episode aired, it was actually the ninth episode produced during the season; reportedly, the episode contained &quot;so many problems&quot; that the Fox executives nearly refused to allow the finished product to air. At the last minute, however, they relented, and allowed the episode to be aired later on in the season, several weeks after its intended air date.
Plot
13 years before the present, Robert Fassl (W. Earl Brown) sits in his van. He later approaches a home and claims to be there to repair the cable. As Fassl holds up a piece of paper to look show the family who called for the repair, blood spatter splashes across the paper. He looks up and sees the house's occupants with slit throats in pools of blood. Abruptly, two police officers burst into the house and apprehend Fassl. One of the officers who goes to check out the kitchen, turns to reveal he is John Doggett (Robert Patrick), back when he was a NYPD officer.
In the present day, Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) discusses Fassl's release&lt;U+2014&gt;due to DNA evidence&lt;U+2014&gt;with an angry Doggett. He describes catching Fassl&lt;U+2014&gt;who was given the name the Screwdriver Killer&lt;U+2014&gt;and how he is certain of the man&lt;U+2019&gt;s guilt. Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrives and confirms the test results conclusively disprove Fassl as the killer. Meanwhile, at the courthouse, Fassl notices a mysterious bearded man. Fassl stays with with lawyer, Jana Fain, and she shows him his room. Bob Fassl holds a Rosary beads and prays frantically. Fain finds Fassl praying and is proud that Bob has not let his faith be destroyed by all that has happened. As she closes the door, the Bearded Man appears behind him. He begs for the man not to hurt her but he strikes Bob and walks out the door with a screwdriver. Later, Fain confronts Robert Fassl about possibly being in her things. He is relieved that she is unharmed but learns that the housekeeper, Mrs. Dowdy, is missing. Fassl finds her body, cleans up the blood and dismembers her remains to cover up what has happened.
Scully tells Doggett that her own test of the DNA confirms that Fassl is not a murderer. However, the DNA is similar enough with many alleles in common, suggesting a blood relative, but Fassl is an only child. Eventually Reyes proposes that the murders are being conducted by some kind of entity rather than an actual person. Meanwhile, Assistant District Attorney Kaylor goes to see Jana Fain but finds only Fassl. He tells him about the settlement deal but Bob begs to go back to prison and says its his fault. Kaylor refuses to hear but is suddenly killed by the bearded man. Fassl places Kaylor&lt;U+2019&gt;s remains among others in the sewers. He walks away from the trophy shelf. After hearing of Kaylor's disappearance, Reyes theorizes that Fassl is unwilling to see his darker half to such a degree, because of his piety, that he actually is two people now. She suggests it goes beyond merely having two personalities, rather he physically changes into another person, hence the different but similar DNA.
The Bearded Man demands that Fassl kill his lawyer. He beats him up and when Fain checks on him, she finds an injured Fassl. She says she will fix him up. He stands behind her as Fassl; she then opens the medicine cabinet.. When she closes it, the mirror shows the Bearded Man. Doggett and Reyes argue about the case while staking out Jana Fain&lt;U+2019&gt;s home. Eventually, they see the Bearded Man run out of the house, Doggett pursues him while Reyes checks on Fain. She is alive and explains that Fassl was there one minute and then the other man was there. Reyes falls through a grate and into the sewer water. She finds a wall of skeletons and fresher corpses. Doggett is attacked and a struggle ensues; the Bearded Man falls into water. Doggett climbs in after him and pulls out Robert Fassl. In the end, Doggett is perplexed. Reyes tries to remind him that it does not matter as long as the case is solved.1
Production
&quot;Undeneath&quot; was written and directed by executive producer John Shiban. This marked his directoral debut.2 As the ninth season progressed and the show's ratings began to plummet, Fox became more and more actively involved in the show's style and direction.3 Although &quot;Underneath&quot; was the twelfth episode aired, it was actually the ninth episode produced during the season; reportedly, the episode contained &quot;so many problems&quot; that the Fox executives very nearly nixed the finished product.4 At the last minute, however, they relented, and allowed the episode to be aired later on in the season, several weeks after its intended air date.5
The episode, which explores John Doggett's backstory as a New York City police officer, was described as containing similar themes as those &quot;explored on the Millennium series.&quot;6 The episode guest-starred Arthur Nascarella, who was a friend of series co-star Robert Patrick. Patrick was essential in getting Nascarella cast on the show; he later joked &quot;I stole [Nascarella's] New York accent in Copland  and I stole it to do The X-Files, but I got him cast in The X-Files show.&quot;7

The episode received mixed reviews from television critics. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a negative review and called it &quot;easily the worst of the season&quot;.13 He awarded it a 4 out of 10 and concluded that, &quot;We can only hope that none of the remaining episodes are Shiban-related, and pray that he can do a much better job when he writes for Enterprise next season.&quot;14 Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium &amp; The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five, and called the entry &quot;solid and efficient&quot;.15 The two complimented Shiban's directoral efforts, noting that &quot;as a director [he] makes 'Underneath' shine&quot;, but were critical of some of the &quot;trademark X-File moments, citing &quot;the surprise appearance of a face in the bathroom mirror&quot; and &quot;the climactic fight in a sewer&quot; as examples.16 Shearman and Pearson, however, wrote positively of Shiban's realistic depiction of Dogget.17
