Plain dress is a religious practice in which people dress in clothes of traditional modest design, sturdy fabric, and conservative cut. It is used to show humility and to preserve communal separateness from the rest of the world. It is practiced by some Amish, Apostolics , Brethren, Hutterites, Mennonites, traditionalist Catholics, and Quakers, among others.1 Hasidic and Haredi Jews also dress plainly, Rabbis in particular.
