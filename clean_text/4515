Notes



A ^ The non-fade-out version of &quot;Dreaming of Me&quot; appears on the CD versions of Speak &amp; Spell, despite being officially a non-album track.
B ^ &quot;But Not Tonight&quot; was released as the A-side only in the United States.
C ^ In the United States, Australia and New Zealand the megamix of &quot;Route 66&quot; and &quot;Behind the Wheel&quot; are the songs that charted.
D ^ &quot;Dangerous&quot; and &quot;Halo&quot; were not released as singles. They only charted on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, because it measures airplay on alternative rock radio stations in the United States.
E ^ &quot;Home&quot; was released as a double A-side with &quot;Useless&quot; in the United States.
F ^ &quot;Goodnight Lovers&quot; was not eligible to chart in the United Kingdom because its single release contained more than three tracks
