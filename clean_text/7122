The following is a list of Governors of the State of Arkansas and Arkansas Territory. The Governor of Arkansas is the chief executive of the state, and commander-in-chief of its military forces. To be governor, one must be at least 30 years old, a citizen of the United States, and have been a resident of the state for seven years. The governor has the power to veto bills passed by the legislature and to grant pardons in all cases, except for treason and impeachment.
The first state constitution, ratified in 1836, established four-year terms for governors and the requirement that they be residents of the state for ten years. The fifth constitution in 1874, following the American Civil War and Reconstruction, limited the executive's power while increasing the legislative's, lowering gubernatorial terms to two years and changed the residency requirement to seven years. Amendment 63 to the Arkansas Constitution, passed in 1984, increased the terms of both governor and lieutenant governor to four years. A referendum in 1992 limited the governor to two terms.
Until 1925, should the office of governor be rendered empty through death, resignation, removal, or other disability, the president of the state senate would act as governor, until such time as a new governor were elected or the disability removed, or the acting governor's senate term expired. This led to some situations where the governorship changed hands in quick succession, due to senate terms ending or new presidents of the senate being elected. For example, William Kavanaugh Oldham served only six days in 1913 before he was replaced as president of the senate. Should the president of the senate be similarly incapacitated, the next in line for the governorship was the speaker of the state house of representatives.
Amendment 6 to the state constitution, passed in 1914 but not recognized until 1925, created the office of lieutenant governor, to be elected at the same time as governor for the same term. In case of removal of the governor, the lieutenant governor now became acting governor.
The current governor is Mike Beebe, who took office on January 9 2007.
Arkansas was part of Louisiana Territory, later renamed Missouri Territory, from 1805 to 1819; see List of Governors of Missouri for this period.

Governors of Arkansas Territory
Arkansas Territory (named Arkansaw Territory until around 18221) was split from Missouri Territory on July 4 1819.
As secretary of the territory from 1819 to 1829, Robert Crittenden served as acting governor whenever the appointed governor was not in the state. This meant he was in fact the first person to be governor of Arkansas Territory, since James Miller did not arrive in the territory until nine months after his appointment. Similarly, after George Izard was appointed governor, he did not arrive in the territory for nearly two months, during which Crittenden was again acting governor. He also acted as governor during the times when the territory had no appointed governor.

The territory was formally organized with the name &quot;Arkansaw&quot;, but spellings including &quot;Arkansas&quot; and &quot;Arkansa&quot; remained common until around 1822, when the popularity of the Arkansas Gazette helped standardize the spelling as &quot;Arkansas&quot;.↩
James Miller was appointed territorial governor on March 3 1819, the same date the bill organizing Arkansaw Territory was signed. However, to avoid the hot southern summer, he delayed his departure from New Hampshire until September, and took a non-direct route, finally arriving in the territory on December 26 1819. Robert Crittenden, Secretary of the territory, served as acting governor while Miller was delayed.↩
Resigned citing poor health. At the time of his resignation, he had been absent from the territory for 18 months.↩
George Izard did not arrive in Arkansas Territory until May 31 1825; Robert Crittenden, Secretary of the territory, acted as governor in his stead, though Crittenden himself was out of state when Izard arrived.↩
Died in office.↩
The office of lieutenant governor was not created until 1914, and was not filled until 1926. The amendment to the state constitution creating the office was narrowly voted in by the electorate in 1914. The Speaker of the House declared that the measure had lost because it did not receive a majority of the highest vote total from that election. In 1925, it was discovered that a 1910 law amended this requirement such that only a majority of the votes on the specific question was required. Therefore, the 1914 initiative was declared to be valid.↩
Resigned to run for the United States House of Representatives, winning the election.↩
As president of the state senate, acted as governor for unexpired term.↩
Resigned due to the low salary he received as governor.↩
As president of the state senate, acted as governor until special election.↩
Elected in a special election to fill unexpired term.↩
Resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate.↩
As president of the state senate, acted as governor for unexpired term.↩
Removed from office for a short time due to the Brooks-Baxter War.↩
Resigned after suffering a nervous breakdown soon after taking office.↩
As president of the state senate, acted as governor until the legislature adjourned.↩
As the new president pro tempore of the state senate, became acting governor until his senate term expired.↩
Acted as governor for three days between the end of Governor Pindall's senate term and the next elected governor's term.↩

As president of the state senate, acted as governor for six days before a new president of the senate was elected.↩
As newly-elected president of the senate, acted as governor until special election.↩
Resigned to be a judge on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.↩
As lieutenant governor, acted as governor for unexpired term, and was subsequently elected in his own right.↩

As lieutenant governor, acted as governor for unexpired term.↩


Resigned after being elected President of the United States.↩
