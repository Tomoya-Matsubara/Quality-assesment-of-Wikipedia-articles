The Greek text of the codex has been revised according to the Vulgate.Bruce M. Metzger, Bart D. Ehrman, The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration, Oxford University Press New York  Oxford, 2005, p. 147. The Greek text is made to conform to the Vulgate Latin text, but the assimilation is far from complete. It has some Western text-type Western elements in the Pauline epistles.http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/Manuscripts501-1000.html#m629 Encyclopedia of Textual Criticism
