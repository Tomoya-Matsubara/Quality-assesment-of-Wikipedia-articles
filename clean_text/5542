As a freshman in 2005, Teel saw action in eight games, completing 51 of 101 passes for 683 yards and two touchdowns. In 2006, along with Brian Leonard, Tiquan Underwood, Eric Foster, Kenny Britt, and Ray Rice, Teel led Rutgers to a 9&lt;U+2013&gt;0 start and one of the biggest wins in school history with a victory over Louisville, then ranked #3 nationally by the Coaches' Poll. The Scarlet Knights finished with an 11&lt;U+2013&gt;2 record as Teel tallied 2,135 passing yards and 12 touchdowns on the season.

Teel struggled at the outset of the 2008 campaign by throwing seven interceptions over his first six games as the Scarlet Knights stumbled to a 1&lt;U+2013&gt;5 record, but the fifth-year senior rallied and led Rutgers to six straight wins to close out the season along with a fourth straight berth in a college bowl game. On October 25, 2008, Teel threw six touchdown passes for 362 yards against #17 Pittsburgh, a school record. He was chosen as National Player of the Week for the first time in his career. On December 4, 2008, Teel had a career night in the final home game of his college career, completing 21 of 26 passes for 447 yards and seven touchdowns with no interceptions as Rutgers routed Louisville 63-14. The yardage and touchdown totals were single game school records as the Scarlet Knights finished their schedule at 7&lt;U+2013&gt;5.
On the last game of his collegiate career in the 2008 PapaJohns.com Bowl against NC State, Teel helped Rutgers rally from a 17&lt;U+2013&gt;6 deficit by throwing for 319 yards and two touchdowns.
On January 25, 2009, Teel was honored as Big East Conference Player of the Year by the New Jersey Sports Writers Association.3
