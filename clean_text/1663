Turkish lang tr Trke, Audio-IPA Turkce.ogg tykte is a Turkic languages Turkic language, and thus a member of the proposed Altaic languages Altaic language family. It is spoken predominantly in Turkey, with smaller communities of speakers in Cyprus, Greece and Eastern Europe, as well as by several million immigrants in Western Europe. Turkish is the most widely spoken Turkic language, with 6573 million native speakers worldwide. 

The roots of the language can be traced to Central Asia, with the first written records dating back nearly 1,200 years. To the west, the influence of Ottoman Turkish language Ottoman Turkishthe immediate precursor of today's Turkishspread as the Ottoman Empire expanded. In 1928, as one of Atatrk's Reforms in the early years of the new Turkish Republic, the Ottoman Turkish alphabet Ottoman script was replaced with a phonetic variant of the Latin alphabet.  Concurrently, the newly founded Turkish Language Association initiated a drive to reform the language by removing Persian language Persian and Arabic language Arabic  loanwords in favor of native variants and coinages from Turkic roots.

The distinctive characteristics of Turkish are vowel harmony and extensive Agglutinative language agglutination. The basic word order of Turkish is Subject Object Verb. Turkish has a T-V distinction: second-person plural forms can be used for individuals as a sign of respect. Turkish also has no noun classes or grammatical gender.

Turkish is a member of the Turkish, or Western, subgroup of the Oghuz languages, which includes Gagauz language Gagauz and Azerbaijani language Azeri. The Oghuz languages form the Southwestern subgroup of the Turkic languages, a language family comprising some thirty living languages spoken across Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Siberia, which some linguists believe to be a part of a larger Altaic languages Altaic language family.cite web author=Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. ed. authorlink=Ethnologue url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90009 title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition.

History

seealso Turkic peoples History of the Turkic peoples
The first records of the Turkic languages date back to some time between 732 and 735, when two monumental inscriptions were erected in the Orkhon Valley in honour of the Gktrks Gktrk prince Kul Tigin and his brother Emperor Bilge Khan. After the discovery and excavation of the monuments and associated stone slabs in the wider area by Russian archaeologists between 188993, it became established that the language on the inscriptions was the Old Turkic language written using the Orkhon script, which has also been referred to as Turkic runes or runiform due to an external similarity to the Germanic languages Germanic runic alphabets.Ishjatms

With the Turkic expansion during Early Middle Ages c. 6th century 6th11th century 11th centuries, peoples speaking Turkic languages spread across Central Asia, covering a vast geographical region stretching from Siberia to Europe and the Mediterranean. The Seljuq dynasty Seljuqs of the Oghuz Turks, in particular, brought their language, Oghuz languages Oghuz Turkic, the direct ancestor of today's Turkish language, into Anatolia during 11th century.Findley

Also during the 11th century, an early linguist of the Turkic languages, Mahmud al-Kashgari Kagarl Mahmud from the Kara-Khanid Khanate, published the first comprehensive dictionary of Turkic languages, the Compendium of the Turkic Dialects Ottoman Turkish: Divn Lgati't-Trk, which also included the first known map of the geographical distribution of Turkic speakers.Soucek

Ottoman Turkish
Main Ottoman Turkish language
Following the adoption of Islam c. 950 by the Kara-Khanid Khanate and the Seljuq dynasty Seljuq Turks, regarded as the cultural ancestors of the Ottoman Empire Ottomans, the administrative language of these states acquired a rather large collection of loanwords from Arabic language Arabic and Persian language Persian. Turkish literature during the Ottoman period, in particular Ottoman poetry Ottoman Divan poetry, was heavily influenced by Persian, including the adoption of poetic meters and a great quantity of borrowings. During the course of over six hundred years of the Ottoman Empire c. 12991922, the literary and official language of the empire was a mixture of Turkish, Persian and Arabic, which differed considerably from everyday spoken Turkish of the time, and is termed Ottoman Turkish language Ottoman Turkish.

Language reform and modern Turkish

After the foundation of the Republic of Turkey, and following the #Writing system script reform, the Turkish Language Association TDK was established under the patronage of Mustafa Kemal Atatrk in 1932, with the aim of conducting research on Turkish. One of the tasks of the newly established association was to initiate a language reform to replace loanwords of Arabic and Persian origin with Turkish equivalents.See Lewis 2002 for a thorough treatment of the Turkish language reform.  By banning the usage of replaced loanwords in the press, the association succeeded in removing several hundred foreign words from the language. While most of the words introduced to the language by the TDK were newly derived from Turkic languages Turkic roots, it also opted for reviving Old Turkish words which had not been used for centuries.

Due to this sudden change in the language, older and younger people in Turkey started to differ in vocabularies they used. While the generations born before the 1940s tend to use the older terms of Arabic or Persian origin, the younger generations favor new expressions.  It is particularly ironic that Atatrk himself, in his Nutuk monumental speech to the new Grand_National_Assembly_of_Turkey Parliament in 1927, used a style of Ottoman diction which today sounds so alien that it has had to be translated twice into modern Turkish: first in 1963, then again in 1986.Lewis 2002: 2-3.  There is also a political dimension to the language debate, with conservative groups tending to use more archaic words in the press or everyday language.

The past few decades have seen the continuing work of the TDK to coin new Turkish words to express new concepts and technologies as they enter the language, mostly from English language English. Many of these new words, particularly information technology terms, have received widespread acceptance, but the TDK is occasionally criticized for coining words which sound contrived and artificial. Some earlier coinages, too, such as betik to replace kitap, book or blem to replace frka, political party,  failed to meet with popular approval.  In fact frka has been replaced by the French loanword parti.

Many of the words derived by TDK coexist with their older counterparts. This usually happens when a loanword changes its original meaning. For instance dert, derived from the Persian word dard  pain, is used in Turkish to mean problem or trouble; whereas the native Turkish word ar is used for physical pain. Sometimes the loanword has a slightly different meaning from the native Turkish word, giving rise to a situation similar to the coexistence of Germanic languages Germanic and Romance languages Romance words in English see List of Germanic and Latinate equivalents. Among some of the old words that were replaced are terms in geometry, cardinal directions, some months' names and many nouns and adjectives. Some examples of modern Turkish words and the old loanwords are:

Turkish is natively spoken by the Turkish people in Turkey and by the Turkish diaspora in some 30 other countries. In particular, Turkish speaking minorities exist in countries that formerly in whole or part belonged to the Ottoman Empire, such as Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece primarily in Western Thrace, the Republic of Macedonia, Romania, and Serbia.cite web author=Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. ed. authorlink=Ethnologue url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=tur title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition.

Official status
Turkish is the official language of Turkey, and is one of the official languages of Cyprus. It also has official but not primary status in the Prizren District of Kosovo as well as several municipalities of Republic of Macedonia, depending on the concentration of Turkish-speaking local population.

In Turkey, the regulatory body for Turkish is the Turkish Language Association Trk Dil Kurumu or TDK, which was founded in 1932 under the name Trk Dili Tetkik Cemiyeti Society for Research on the Turkish Language. The Turkish Language Association was influenced by the linguistic purism ideology and one of its primary tasks was the replacement of loanwords and foreign grammatical constructions with equivalents of Turkish origin,The name TDK itself exemplifies this process.  The words tetkik and cemiyet in the original name are both Arabic loanwords the final -i of cemiyeti being a Turkish possessive suffix; kurum is a native Turkish word based on the verb kurmak, set up, found. which, together with the adoption of the new Turkish alphabet in 1928, shaped the modern Turkish language spoken today see #Language reform and modern Turkish below. TDK became an independent body in 1951, with the lifting of the requirement that it should be presided over by the Minister of Education. This status continued until August, 1983, when it was again made into a governmental body in the Constitution of Turkey constitution of 1982 following the military 1980 Turkish coup d'tat coup d'tat of 1980.cite web author=Turkish Language Association authorlink=Turkish Language Association url=http://www.tdk.gov.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EF2858DA18F4388CDD title=Trk Dil Kurumu - Tarihe History of the Turkish Language Association accessdate=2007-03-18 tr icon

The phoneme IPA // usually referred to as yumuak g soft g, ' in Turkish orthography, actually represents a rather weak front-velar or palatal approximant between front vowels. It never occurs at the beginning of a word, but always follows a vowel. When word-final or preceding another consonant, it lengthens the preceding vowel.  

The sounds IPA c, IPA  and IPA l are in complementary distribution with IPA k, IPA g and IPA , the former occurring with front vowels and the latter with back vowels.  These allophones are not distinguished in the orthography, in which both series are written ,  and .  When a vowel is added to nouns ending with postvocalic , the  becomes   by consonant alternation linguistics alternation.This rule does not apply to monosyllabic nouns. Lewis 2001:10.

Vowels

 Image:Turkish vowel chart.png
 

The vowels of the Turkish language are, in their alphabetical order, a, e, Turkish dotted and dotless I ', Turkish dotted and dotless I i, o, ', u, '. There are no diphthongs in Turkish and when two vowels come together, which occurs rarely and only with loanwords, each vowel retains its individual sound.

Vowel harmony
Details Vowel harmony

The Turkish vowel system can be considered as being two-dimensional, where vowels are characterised by two features: Vowel backness front/back and Roundedness rounded/unrounded.  Vowel harmony is the principle by which a native Turkish word incorporates either exclusively back vowels a, ', o, u or exclusively front vowels e, i, ', '.  The pattern of vowels is shown in the table below.Note that this table is essentially the same as the IPA vowel chart shown above: both table and chart indicate the physical location and quality of each vowel.

Grammatical affixes have a chameleon-like qualityLewis 1953:21, and obey one of the following patterns of vowel harmony:
twofold -e/-a:For the terms twofold and fourfold, as well as the superscript notation, see Lewis 1953:21-22.  In his more recent works Lewis prefers to omit the superscripts, on the grounds that there is no need for this once the principle has been grasped Lewis 2001:18. the locative suffix, for example, is -de after front vowels and -da after back vowels.  The notation -de2 is a convenient shorthand for this pattern.
fourfold -i/-/-/-u: the genitive suffix, for example, is -in or -n after unrounded vowels front or back respectively; and -n or -un after the corresponding rounded vowels.  In this case the shorthand notation -in4 is used.

The following examples, based on the Turkish copula copula -dir4 it is, illustrate the principles of vowel harmony in practice: Trkiye'dir it is Turkey, kapdr it is the door, but gndr it is the day, paltodur it is the coat.

There are some exceptions to the rules of vowel harmony.  In compound words the vowels need not harmonize between the constituent words of the compound thus forms like bu gn today or ba kent capital are permissible. In addition, vowel harmony does not apply in loanwords and some invariant affixes, such as -yor present tense and -bil- potential.  Some loanwords do, however, exhibit partial or even complete vowel harmony eg mmkn possible rbn binoculars rbn.In Lewis's marvellously precise formulation, The effect of vowel harmony extends to non-Turkish words too, bringing as many vowels as possible of a foreign borrowing into one class, or pressing a foreign borrowing whose vowels happen to be all of one class still further into Turkish form.  Lewis 2001: 17.  There are also a few native Turkish words that do not follow the rule, such as anne mother.  In such wordsand in loanwords as wellsuffixes harmonize with the final vowel: thus annedir she is a mother.  The #Geographic distribution road sign in the photograph above illustrates all of these features:
a native compound which does not obey vowel harmony: Orta ky middle villagea place name
a loanword also violating vowel harmony: viyadk viaduct 4 harmonizing with the final vowel and softening the k by consonant alternation: viyad

 Stress 
Stress linguistics Stress is usually on the last syllable.Handbook of the IPA, p. 155 Exceptions include some suffix combinations and loanwords, particularly from
Italian language Italian and Modern Greek language Greek, as well as many proper names.  While such loanwords are usually stressed on the penultimate syllable /okanta/ lokanta restaurant or /iskele/ iskele quay, the stress of proper names is less predictable /istanbu/ stanbul,  /akaa/ Ankara.

Grammar
main Turkish grammar

Turkish is an agglutinative language and frequently uses affixes, or endings.This section draws heavily on Lewis 2001 and, to a lesser extent, Lewis 1953.  Only the most important references are specifically flagged with footnotes.  One word can have many affixes and these can also be used to create new words, such as creating a verb from a noun, or a noun from a verbal root see the section on #Word formation Word formation. Most affixes indicate the grammatical function of the word.see Lewis 2001 Ch XIV.
The only native prefixes are alliteration alliterative intensifying syllables used with adjectives or adverbs: for example smscak boiling hot cak and masmavi bright blue ekoslovakyallatramadklarmzdanmsnz, meaning You must be one of those we couldn't turn into a Czechoslovak.  This example is of course contrived; but long words do frequently occur in normal Turkish, as in this heading of a newspaper obituary column: Bayramlaamadklarmz Bayram festival-Recipr-Impot-Partic-Plur-PossPl1; Those of our number with whom we cannot exchange the season's greetings.This splendid word appeared at the time of Bayram, the festival marking the end of the month of fasting.  Lewis 2001:287.  

 Nouns 
There is no definite article in Turkish.  Turkish nouns decline by taking case-endings, as in Latin. There are six Declension noun cases in Turkish, with all the endings following vowel harmony shown in the table using the shorthand #Vowel harmony superscript notation.  The plural marker -ler2 immediately follows the noun before any case or other affixes eg kylerin of the villages.

The declension of aa illustrates two important features of Turkish phonology: consonant assimilation linguistics assimilation in suffixes aatan, aata and voice phonetics voicing of final consonants before vowels aacn, aaca, aac.

Additionally, nouns can take suffixes that assign grammatical person person: for example -imiz4, our.  With the addition of the Turkish copula copula for example -im4, I am complete sentences can be formed.  The interrogative word interrogative particle mi4 immediately follows the word being questioned: kye mi? going to the village?, aa m? is it a tree?.

 Adjectives 
Turkish adjectives are not declension declined. However most adjectives can also be used as nouns, in which case they are declined: e.g. gzel beautiful  gzeller the beautiful ones / people. Used attributively, adjectives precede the nouns they modify. The adjectives var existent and yok non-existent are used in many cases where English would use there is or have, e.g. st yok there is no milk, lit. the milk is non-existent; the construction noun 1-GEN noun 2-POSS var/yok can be translated noun 1 has/doesn't have noun 2; imparatorun elbisesi yok the emperor has no clothes the emperor-of clothes-his non-existent; kedimin ayakkablar yoktu my cat had no shoes, lit. cat-my-of shoe-plur.-its non-existent-past tense.

The Turkish personal pronouns in the nominative case are ben 1s, sen 2s, o 3s, biz 1pl, siz 2pl, or formal/polite 2s, and onlar 3pl. They are declined regularly with some exceptions: benim 1s gen.; bizim 1pl gen.; bana 1s dat.; sana 2s dat.; and the oblique forms of o use the root on.  All other pronouns reflexive kendi and so on are declined regularly.

Verbs
seealso Turkish copula
Turkish verbs indicate Grammatical person person. They can be made negative, potential can or impotential cannot. Furthermore, Turkish verbs show Grammatical tense tense Present tense present, Past tense past, Grammatical mood#Inferential inferential, Future tense future, and aorist, Grammatical mood mood Conditional mood conditional, Imperative mood imperative, necessitative, and Optative mood optative, and Grammatical aspect aspect.  Negation is expressed by the infix -me2- immediately following the stem.

All Turkish verbs are conjugated in the same way, except for the irregular and defective verb i-, the Turkish copula, which can be used in compound forms the shortened form is called an enclitic: Gelememiti = Gelememi idi = Gelememi + i- + -di

 Participles 
Turkish has several participles, including present with the ending -en2, future -ecek2, past -mi4 and aorist -er2 or -ir4.  These forms can function as either adjectives or nouns: oynamayan ocuklar children who do not play, oynamayanlar those who do not play; okur yazar reader-writer = literate, okur yazarlar literates.  

The most important function of participles is to form modifying phrases equivalent to the relative clauses found in most European languages.  The participles used in these constructions are the future -ecek2 and an older form -dik4, which covers both present and past meanings.See Lewis 2001:163-165, 260-262 for an exhaustive treatment.  The use of these personal or relative participles is illustrated in the following table, in which the examples are presented according to the grammatical case which would be seen in the equivalent English relative clause.For the terms personal and relative participle see Lewis 1958:98 and Lewis 2001:163 respectively.  Most of the examples are taken from Lewis 2001.

Word order
Word order in simple sentences in Turkish is generally Subject Object Verb, as in Japanese language Japanese and Latin, but not English language English. In more complex sentences the basic rule is that the qualifier precedes the qualified: this principle includes, as an important special case, the #Participles participial modifiers discussed above.  The definite precedes the indefinite: thus ocua hikyeyi anlatt she told the child the story, but hikyeyi bir ocua anlatt she told the story to a child.Lewis 2001: 239-240.

It is possible to alter the word order to stress the importance of a certain word or phrase. The main rule is that the word before the verb has the stress without exception. For example, if one wants to say Hakan went to school with a stress on the word school okul, the indirect object it would be Hakan okula gitti. If the stress is to be placed on Hakan the subject, it would be Okula Hakan gitti which means it's Hakan who went to school.

mainarticle Turkish alphabet
Turkish is written using a Turkish alphabet modified version of the Latin alphabet introduced in 1928 by Mustafa Kemal Atatrk Atatrk to replace the Arabic alphabet Arabic-based Ottoman Turkish alphabet.   
The Ottoman alphabet marked only three different vowelslong ,  and 'and included several redundant consonants such as variants of z which were distinguished in Arabic but not in Turkish. The omission of short vowels in the Arabic script made it particularly unsuitable for Turkish, which has #Vowel harmony eight vowels.

The reform of the script was an important step in the Atatrk's Reforms cultural reforms of the period. The task of preparing the new alphabet and selecting the necessary modifications for sounds specific to Turkish was entrusted to a Turkish alphabet#Modern Turkish alphabet Language Commission composed of prominent linguists, academics and writers.  The introduction of the new Turkish alphabet was supported by public education centers opened throughout the country, cooperation with publishing companies, and encouragement by Atatrk himself, who toured the country teaching the new letters to the public.cite journal last=Dilaar first=Agop authorlink=Agop Dilaar title=Atatrk ve Yazm journal=Trk Dili issn= 1301-465X volume=35 issue=307 url= http://www.dildernegi.org.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EFC3C6D81741DBEB05 accessdate=2007-03-19 year=1977tr icon
There was a dramatic increase in literacy from its original Third World levels.Coulmas, pp. 243-244 

Turkish now has an alphabet suited to the sounds of the language: the spelling is largely Phonetic spelling phonetic, with one letter corresponding to each phoneme.  Most of the letters are used approximately as in English, the main exceptions being , which denotes IPA d, as in the English word jail, and the undotted  , representing the close back unrounded vowel IPA .Americans will recognize in it the first vowel of Missouri as pronounced by a native of that state.  Lewis 2001:13.   The letter   in principle denotes IPA , but has the property of lengthening the preceding vowel and assimilating any subsequent vowel eg souk cold is pronounced IPA souk.  The letters   and   represent IPA  and IPA t respectively, as in English shall and chill.
