State Route 213 (SR 213) is the shortest state highway in the U.S. state of Washington. The  long unsigned highway serves Malott, a community in Okanogan County. Extending from  (US 97) over the Okanogan River via a bridge to First Avenue in Malott, the roadway is semi-complete, as state law designates that the road should extend to  southwest of Okanogan.
