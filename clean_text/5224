Longyearbyen is the largest settlement and the administrative center of Svalbard, Norway. As of 2008, the town had a population of 2,040. Longyearbyen is located in the valley of Adventdalen, at the end of Adventfjorden, a bay of Isfjorden located on the west coast of Spitsbergen. Since 2002, Longyearbyen Community Council has had many of the same responsibilities of a municipality, including utilities, education, cultural facilities, fire department, roads and ports. It governs an area of . The town is also the seat of the Governor of Svalbard and is the world's northernmost settlement which is not a research or meteorological station.
Known as Longyear City until 1926, the town was established by and named for John Munroe Longyear, whose Arctic Coal Company started coal mining operations in 1906. These were taken over by Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani (SNSK) in 1916, which still conducts mining. The town was burned by the German Kriegsmarine on 8 August 1943, but rebuilt after the Second World War. Traditionally, Longyearbyen was a company town, but from the 1990s, most mining operations moved to Sveagruva and the company has seen an large increase in tourism and research. This has seen the arrival of institutions such as the University Centre in Svalbard, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault and Svalbard Satellite Station. The community is served by Svalbard Airport, Longyear and Svalbard Church.
History

Longyear City in 1908

In 1896, Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab started operating tours to Hotellneset. To accommodate tourists, they built a prefabricated hotel, but it was not profitable and was closed after the 1897 season. Two families overwintered there in 1898&lt;U+2013&gt;99.1 Norway Post operted a post office at Hotellneset from 1897 to 1899.2 The first commercially viable coal on Svalbard was harvested by S&lt;U+00F8&gt;ren Zakariassen in 1899.3 In 1901, Bergen-Spitsbergen Kullgrube-kompani started mining coal in Adventtoppen. During their first summer season, they mined . They lived on board their ship and freighted the coal with a row-boat. In 1903, they produced .4
The American industrialist John Munro Longyear visited Spistbergen as a tourist in 1901, where he met with an expedition prospecting for coal. He returned to Spitsbergen 1903, where he met Henrik B. N&lt;U+00E6&gt;ss in Adventsfjorden, who gave him information on coal fields and samples. Along with his associate Frederick Ayer, he bought the Norwegian claims on the west side of Adventfjord, and expanded the claims significantly the following year. In 1906, the Boston-based Arctic Coal Company, with Ayer and Longyear as the main shareholders, started mining in Mine 1a after having built docks and the first housing.5 The company had American administration, but mostly Norwegian laborers. The company named the town Longyear City.6 Coal was transported the  from the mine to the port using an aerial tramway.7 In 1913, the company started preliminary work to open Mine 2a.8
 Following financial difficulties during the First World War,9 the mining operations were bought by Store Norske, which was incorporated in Oslo on 30 November 1916.10 That year, SNSK built five new barracks, including one that was made into a hospital.11 SNSK introduced its own money with approval from Norges Bank, consisting entirely of banknotes at par with Norwegian krone.12 The American community buried their dead at Hotellneset. In 1918, eleven people were killed by the Spanish flu and a graveyard was established in Longyear City.13 In 1920, 26 men were killed in a coal dust explosion in in Mine 1. This resulted in the mine being closed14 and electric operation being taken into use in Mine 2.15 The same year, the first truck was delivered to the town for use in the mining operations.16
The Church of Norway appointed Thorleif &lt;U+00D8&gt;stenstad av Svalbard's first vicar and teacher in 1920.17 He started teaching eight school children, with the school organized in cooperation with SNSK.18 The first Svalbard Church opened on 28 August 1921,19 and the churches reading room was from then used as a school.20 Longyear City was renamed Longyearbyen in 1926.21
The Norwegian Telecommunications Administration established a coast radio station at Finneset (Svalbard Radio) in 1911. In 1930, the radio station was moved to Longyearbyen.22 SS Lyngen started calling regularly during the summer season from 1935 at Longyearbyen, starting the town's tourism industry.23 In 1937, SNSK established Sverdrupbyen to house workers for Mine 1b and operation of the mine started in 1939.24 In 1938, Longyearbyen's first road was completed, between the town center and Sverdrupbyen.25 Operations at Mine 2b, a different entrance to Mine 2a, started in 1939.26
 Svalbard remained unaffected by the German occupation of Norway in 1940. However, the achipelago became of strategic important in the supply chain between the Allied powers from 1941, in addition to the supply of badly-needed coal. The Norwegian government-in-exile rejected a Soviet&lt;U+2013&gt;British occupation;27 instead The British Army started Operation Gauntlet to evacuate Spitsbergen. On 29 August 1941, the entire population of Ny-&lt;U+00C5&gt;lesund was evacuated to Longyearbyen and on 3 September, 765 people were evacuated from Longyearbyen to Scotland. Later the last 150 men were also evacuated.28 With Longyearbyen depopulated, it a small German garrison and air strip was established, mostly to provide meteorological data. After the British Operation Fritham regained control of Barentsburg, the German forces left Longyearbyen without combat.29
In September 1943, the Kriegsmarine dispatched two battleships, Tirpitz and Scharnhorst, and nine destroyers to set afire Longyearbyen, Barentsburg and Grumant.30 Only four buildings in Longyearben survived: the hospital, the power station, an office building and a residential building, in addition to Sverdrupbyen. Longyearbyen remained unsettled until the end of the war, with the first ship from the mainland leaving on 27 June 1945.31
Plans for reconstruction were laid during the war, allowing a quick reconstruction of Longyearbyen and the stating of mining operations. By 1948, coal production reached the pre-war level of .32 Nybyen was established in 1946 and consisted of five barracks, each with place 72 people.33 The first issue of Svalbardposten was published in November 1948. Until then, there had irregularly been published various wall newspapers.34 In 1949, Longyearbyen received telephone service with the mainland via a radio connection from Svalbard Radio to Harstad.35 In 1949, a farm was built in Longyearbyen to hold cattle for milk. From 1950 it also received pigs and hens.36 A local radio station started broadcasting in 1950.37 The burial ground remained in use until 1950, seeing 44 people buried.38 However, it was discovered that the bodies were failing to decompose because of the permafrost and since bodies have been sent to the mainland for burial.39 The community center Huset opened in 1951.40
Mining in Mine 1b was terminated in 1958,41 but operation in Mine 5 started in 1959. Preliminary work on Mine 4 started in 1954, and from 1960 it was used as a reserve mine.42 The Norwegian Air Force started serving Longyearbyen with postal flights in the 1950s. In 1959, a man was seriously ill, so a landing strip was prepared in Adventsdalen. From the same year following year, Braathens SAFE started serving the tundra airport with irregular flights during winter.43 In 1957, a principal was hired at the primary school and a new church was opened on 24 August 1958.44 From 1961, the primary school was supplemented by a private middle school.45 In 1959, Troms&lt;U+00F8&gt; Sparebank established a bank branch in Longyearbyen.46
In the 1960s, the towns farm was closed and milk production taken over through production from powdered milk.47 The first serial-produced snowmobile was taken into use in 1961. By 1969, there were 140 registered snowmobiles but only 33 registered cars.48 From 1962 to 1984, there was a recreational center at Sverdrupbyen.49 Ordinary operation in Mine 4 started in 1966, but were terminated already in 1970,50 two years after Mine 2b closed.51 Operations in Mine 6 commenced in 1969.52 Television broadcasting equipment was installed in 1969. The schedule of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation was sent with a two-week delay and was sent twice, in the afternoon and evening, to allow shift workers to watch daytime television.53
In 1971, a new school building with a combined primary and lower secondary school was opened, along with a new gymnasium and a a  swimming pool.54 The Svalbard Council was established in 1 November 1971. It consist of 17 non-partisan members which were elected or appointed in three different groups (SNSK employees, government employees and others). The exact rules changed several times.55 Operations of Mine 3 started in March 1971.56 Operations in Mine 7 started in 1972.57 In 1973, the Ministry of Trade and Industry bough a third of SNSK and followed up by buying additional shares to reach a 99.94 percent ownership in 1976.58 The airport was opened in 1975, giving four weekly services to mainland Norway and semi-weekly services to Russia.59 In 1978, the community received satellite communications with the mainland.60 The same year, an upper secondary program was introduced at the public school.61 From 1984, television programs were broadcast live via satellite.62
 Store Norske underwent a gradual change during the 1980s. From 1980, Spitsbergen money is taken out of circulation and replaced with ordinary Norwegian currency.63 The following year Mine 6 closed.64 From 1982, SNSK permitted private individuals to own and operate cars. By 1990, there were 353 registered cars and 883 snowscooters.65 From 1 July 1983, SNSK moved its head office from Bergen to Longyearbyen.66 From 1 January 1989, SNSK established Svalbard Samfunnsdrift (SSD), a limited company which was responsible for public infrastructure and services.67 Responsibilities included healthcare, the fire department, the kindergarten, roads, garbage disposal, power production, the water and sewer system, the cinema, cultural actives and the library.68 On 1 January 1993, ownership of SSD was taken over by the Ministry of Trade and Industry.69
During the 1990s, authorities started a process to &quot;normalize&quot; Longyearbyen by abolishing the company town scheme and introducing a full range of services, a varied economy and local democracy.70 One such example was the establishment of a shopping mall in 1992, which replaced SNSK's provision store.71 Similarly, Esso opened a commercial fuel station in 1994.72 The Svalbard Council changed its regulations from 1993 and allowed parties to run for election for the 15 seats.73 In a step to increase tourism, Svalbard Polar Hotel opened in 1995,74 and a year later mining of Mine 3 terminated.75 Longyearbyen Communicty Council was established in 2002, which gave it many of the same responsibilities and structure as a municipality.76
This period also saw the rise of a number of scientific establishments. The Agricultural University of Norway had established a primitive seed bank was established in 1984.77 The University Centre in Svalbard opened on 6 September 1993 and had 30 students in its inaugural semester.78 The European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association (EISCAT) started building their radar in 1993, which opened in 1996.79 Telenor Mobil established GSM coverage in 1995.80 Svalbard Satellite Station opened in 1999.81
Geography
 Longyearbyen, the largest settlement in Svalbard, is located in the lower portion of the valley of Longyeardalen, along the river of Longyearelva. The lower parts of the town lay along the southwestern short of the bay of Adventfjorden, a  branch of Isfjorden.82 Longyearbyen is on the Nordenski&lt;U+00F6&gt;ld Land peninsula of Spitsbergen, the largest island of the Svalbard archipelago.83 It is the world's northern-most town, with all settlements further north being research or meteorological outposts.84 Across the bay lay the abandoned settlements of Advent City85 and Hiorthhamn.86
Longyearbyen is divided into several neighborhoods. On the west side of the river, along the bay, lays the port and affiliated utility and industrial services. Furthest west this area is called Bykaia and further in Sj&lt;U+00F8&gt;omr&lt;U+00E5&gt;det. Above lays Skj&lt;U+00E6&gt;ringa, which contains the Governor's offices. Slightly up the valley on the west side lays Gamle Longyearbyen (&quot;Old Longyearbyen&quot;) and the church. Even further up lays the gravel yard, then Huset and the cinema, and finally Sverdrupbyen. Most of the residential, commerical and cultural institutions are located on th east side of the river. Along the bay the area is called Sj&lt;U+00F8&gt;skrenten. Further up lays the university center and Gruvedalen, the largest residential area. Southwards from there is the main shopping area as well as most public offices and cultural institutions. To the east is the residential area Lia and further up Haugen, which is also the the location of the school. Furthest up in the valley is Mine 2b and Nybyen, which is mostly used as student housing. Westwards out of town towards Hotellneset is the airport and Mine 3. The remaining mines are located in Adventdalen, to the east of town.87

Panorama of Longyearbyen

Demographics
 As of 2008, Longyearbyen had a population of 2,040 people.88 The largest regional group of Norwegians are from Northern Norway, particularly Nordland and Troms, which make more than 40 percent of the population.89 Roughly 300 people (16 percent) are non-Norwegian citizens, with the largest nationalities being from Thailand, Sweden, Russia and Ukraine.90 Because of the dominance of the mining industry, the gender distribution is skewed with 60 percent of adults being males. Longyearbyen has an over-average share of its population between 25 and 44 years old, but nearly no residents over 66. The number of children in relation to the population is average, but Longyearbyen has significantly fewer teenagers than the national average.91
Longyearbyen experiences a very high turnover; in 2008, 427 people (23 percent) moved away from the town.92 The average person lived in Longyearbyen for 6.3 years, although it is 6.6 years for Norwegians and 4.3 years for foreigners. In 2009, about a quarter of the population had lived in the town from before 2000, and could thus be regarded as permanent population. The longest residing people tend to work in the mining industry, followed by local government employees. The shortest tenures are held by students and employees in higher education, tourism and the state.93
Seventy percent of households have a single person, compared to forty-one percent on the mainland, giving an average 1.6 people per household. However, the difference is largely caused by individuals working on Svalbard while their family remains on the mainland. Longyearbyen's population is higher educated than the national average: 54 compared to 43 percent have upper secondary education and 30 compared to 26 percent have tertiary education. Among women, 40 percent have higher education.94
Politics and government
 Longyearbyen Community Council has many of the same responsibilities of a municipality.95 It is organized with a 15-member council which since 2011 has been led by Christin Kristoffersen of the Labour Party.96 Its council's main responsibilities are infrastructure and utilities, including power, land-use and community planning, education from kindergarten to upper secondary level and child welfare. It operates three kindergartens in addition to the 13-year Longyearbyen School.97
No care or nursing services are available, nor is welfare payment available. Norwegian residents retain pension and medical rights through their mainland municipalities.98 The hospital is part of University Hospital of North Norway.99 Other public offices with presence on Longyearbyen are the Norwegian Directorate of Mining, the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Tax Administration and the Church of Norway.100 Longyearbyen is subordinate to Nord-Troms District Court and H&lt;U+00E5&gt;logaland Court of Appeal, both located in Troms&lt;U+00F8&gt;.101
The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 established full Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago. The treaty came into effect in 1925, following the Svalbard Act which established the institution of the Governor of Svalbard. He holds the responsibility as both county governor and chief of police, as well as holding other authority granted from the executive branch. Duties include environmental policy, family law, law enforcement, search and rescue, tourism management, information services, contact with foreign settlements, and judge in some areas of maritime inquiries and judicial examinations&lt;U+2014&gt;albeit never in the same cases as acting as police.102103 Since 2009, Odd Olsen Inger&lt;U+00F8&gt; has been governor;104 he is assisted by a staff of 26 professionals. The institution is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and the Police, but reports to other ministries in matters within their portfolio.105
 Because of the special treaty status of Svalbard, Longyearbyen is subject to Norwegian legislation but citizens of any signatory country may conduct commercial activities and live in town.106 However, people without a source of income can be rejected by the governor.107 The treaty limits Norway's right to collect taxes to that of financing services on Svalbard. Therefore, Longyearbyen has a lower income tax than mainland Norway, and there is no value added tax. The treaty has resulted in Longyearbyen being a demilitarized zone108 and is not part of the European Economic Area nor the Schengen Area like the rest of Norway.109
Culture
The community council runs a number of cultural activities, such as a cinema, a youth club, a library and a gallery.110 The towns sport's club is Svalbard Turn.111 Svalbardhallen is an indoor sport center which includes a multip-sport hall large enough for handball or three badminton courts, a shooting range and a  swimming pool.112 Svalbard Church of the Church of Norway has the entire archipelago as its parish. The congregational hall is  while the sitting room is . The church is built in half-timber.113 Svalbardposten is a weekly newspaper published on Friday. Printing takes place in Troms&lt;U+00F8&gt; and the majority of subscribers live on the mainland.114 There are two museums in town, Svalbard Museum115 and the Spitsbergen Airship Museum.116
Economy
 The only mining still taking place in Longyearbyen is at Mine 7, located  up Adventsdalen. It produces  of coal annually, of which  is used to fuel Longyear Power Station, Norway's only coal-fueled power station.117 Most of Store Norske's production is done at Sveagruva, located on Van Mijenfjorden,  south of Longyearbyen. No roads connect the communities;118 instead, workers live in dormitories towns in Svea, spending three weeks at work and two weeks with their families.119 Seventy percent commute home to the mainland while thirty percent commute to Longyearbyen. Mining has not profitable and Store Norske relies on state subsidies to retain production.120
The University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) has 350 students and a permanent faculty of 40 professors and assistants and 120 guest lecturers. UNIS does not offer degrees, but instead offers semester courses in biology, physics and geology. Student housing is located at Nybyen. The college is part of the  Svalbard Science Centre which also features the Norwegian Polar Institute, EISCAT and Svalbard Science Forum.121 In 2006, about 9,000 research days were spent in Longyearbyen, most of which were by Norwegian. This made Longyearbyen the second-largest research outpost on Svalbard, marginally below Ny-&lt;U+00C5&gt;lesund. In contrast, Longyearbyen has almost only Norwegian research, while Ny-&lt;U+00C5&gt;lesund is roughly evenly split between Norwegian and foreign.122
 Svalbard Satellite Station was built because of Longyearbyen's excellent location to download data from satellites in polar orbit. Located at Plat&lt;U+00E5&gt;berget above Hotellneset, it was a cooperation between NASA and the Norwegian Space Centre, although it has since 2001 been operated by Kongsberg Satellite Services.123 EISCAT operates an incoherent scatter radar to study the northern lights.124 The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, administered by the Global Crop Diversity Trust, is a secure underground facility capable of storing millions of crop seeds. The facility has been designed to protect against natural and human disasters, including global warming, floods and fires, and nuclear holocaust. The site was chosen for a number of factors including its remoteness, sound geology and the ambient temperature of the permafrost.125
Longyearbyen is a the center point of tourism on the archipelago, although most tourism is generated based on nature rather than visiting the community itself. However, Longyearbyen does provide both supplies, accomodation and several museums. In 2008, Longyearbyen experienced 89,000 guest-nights, up from 30,000 in 1995. The average guest stayed 2.2 nights and 60 percent of the capacity was used by tourists. About 40,000 tourists flew in to Longyearbyen. Two-thirds of the tourists come from Norway. In 2007, the tourism industry had a revenue of NOK 291 million and produced 200 man-years.126
Transport
 Longyearbyen has a road network stretching ,127 but the network does not extend to any other communities.128 In 2008 there were 1,481 registered road vehicles 49 percent of all households had a car.129 Cars are registered with registration code ZN on the license plates.130 There is a single garage, Svalbard Auto, which is also a Toyota dealer.131
Snowmobiles are a popular mode of transport and there are more snowmobiles than residents. In 2008, there were registered 2,672 snowmobiles and 69 percent of households owned at least one.132 Off-road motorized transport is prohibited on bare ground, but snowmobiles are used extensively during winter&lt;U+2014&gt;both for commercial and recreational activities. Transport from Longyearbyen to Barentsburg () and Pyramiden () is possible by snowmobile by winter, or by ship all year round.133
Svalbard Airport, Longyear is located at Hotellneset,  northwest of town.134 It has a  long runway and is the only airport which is permitted to serve aircraft from off the archipelago.135 Scandinavian Airlines operates daily flights to Oslo and Troms&lt;U+00F8&gt;,136 while there are irregular flights to Russia. Lufttransport operates regular charter services to Svea Airport and Ny-&lt;U+00C5&gt;lesund Airport, Hamnerabben. Arktikugol operates helicopters to Barentsburg and Pyramiden.137 There are two quays in Longyearbyen, one for export of coal and one for general goods.138
Climate
Svalbard's climate is a combination of a cold Arctic climate tempered by the North Atlantic Current. Nordenski&lt;U+00F6&gt;ld Land is the warmest and wettest part of the archipelago. In part caused by the convergence of mild and humid air from the south and cold air from the north. Average summer temperatures are typically  while average winter temperatures are .139 Longyearbyen experiences midnight sun from 19 April through 23 August, and polar night from 14 November through 29 January. However, the sun does not reach Longyearbyen until 8 March.140
