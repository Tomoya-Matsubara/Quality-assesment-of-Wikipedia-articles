The Hudson Valley Rail Trail is a paved  east&lt;U+2013&gt;west rail trail in the town of Lloyd in Ulster County, New York, stretching from the Poughkeepsie Bridge through the hamlet of Highland. Operated by a variety of railroads, the rail corridor formed the western portion of the Poughkeepsie Bridge Route. It eventually became part of Conrail, which discontinued rail traffic along the corridor and sold it in 1984 to a convicted felon. The land was seized by Ulster County in 1991 and converted to a trail by 1997. The trail was extended east to the Poughkeepsie Bridge in 2010. It intersects US 9W, as well as Route 44/55 and is expected to be extended west, where it will intersect NY 299.
History
Declining rail usage
 The land comprising the Hudson Valley Rail Trail is part of a former rail corridor comprising the Poughkeepsie Bridge Route. It ran east through the hamlet of Highland in the town of Lloyd over the Hudson River via the Poughkeepsie Bridge.1 The corridor was, throughout its history, operated by the Central New England, Philadelphia and Reading,2 New Haven, Erie, Ontario and Western, Lehigh and New England and Penn Central railroads. Under the ownership of Penn Central, traffic along the bridge route was discouraged in favor of a northern route through Selkirk; the use of newer technology at the Selkirk Yard to improve efficiency was cited as the primary reason.3
After Penn Central went bankrupt, Conrail assumed control of the corridor, but opposed renovating it due to budgetary concerns.4 Rail traffic along the western portion of the corridor continued until March 1982, when Conrail received permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon it; the tracks were removed the following year.5 Donald L. Pevsner, a transportation lawyer from Florida, secured a first-refusal option for purchasing the corridor to create restaurants and tourist attractions, but allowed it to expire on November 1, 1984 because he could not secure financial backing;6 he claims that Conrail expressed a desire to sell the corridor to the &quot;first warm body&quot; that would buy it.7 Conrail immediately sold the Poughkeepsie Bridge and adjoining rights-of-way on November 2, 1984 for one dollar to Gordon Schreiber Miller, a convicted bank fraudster89 and charlatan10 who &quot;seemed uncertain what he wished to do&quot; with the corridor.11 Miller did not pay taxes, fines or insurance on the corridor, or maintain it.12 He went bankrupt in 1990 and sold the corridor for one dollar to his friend Vito Moreno, who also did not pay taxes on it. In 1991, Ulster County seized over  of the abandoned corridor in the town of Lloyd.13
Conversion to trail
 Parcels of the right-of-way between Lloyd and the neighboring town of New Paltz were sold off by the county shortly before ownership of the remaining corridor was transfered to Lloyd and converted to a rail trail.1415 Roughly $400,000 in funding to convert the corridor to a trail was acquired through an easement between the town of Lloyd and a broadband utility for the laying of fiber optic cable,16 though only $70,000 was needed to pave the trail. The development of the trail was supported by Highland's Rotary club, which has since built several utilities for trail users, including a welcoming pavilion, garden and parking lot.17 The corridor was officially opened as a trail in 1997.18 Initially  long,az&quot; /&gt;19 it stretched from Riverside Road in the west to Vinyard Avenue in the east; the removal of an overpass on Vinyard Avenue, as well as a blockage under a bridge on US 9W, prevented the trail from continuing east to the Poughkeepsie Bridge.20
Lloyd received a $224,000 state and federal grant in the summer of 2000 to create such a connection.21 Additional funding for the eastern extension was provided in November 2006, when the state granted $1.5 million to construct a bridge and a tunnel, and to complete the path.22 Lloyd received a $7,500 grant in 2002 to extend the trail west to the Black Creek Wetlands Complex;23 the town received an additional grant for $20,000 in May 2005 to complete the Black Creek extension.24
In 2006, a local businessman donated an antique caboose to the trail Association, which was put up beside the welcoming pavilion.25 The caboose was &quot;one of... the first cabooses made of steel instead of wood&quot;.26 An October 2007 study of paint chips from the caboose found the paint contained lead. The study was released less than a week before a town supervisor election in Lloyd; one of the candidates, Ray Costantino, was president of the Hudson Valley Rail Trail Association,27 and one of the early proponents of the trail.28 He claimed the timing of the study was politically motivated.29 Costantino subsequently became town supervisor,30 and the caboose subsequently had its paint replaced and was repaired at a total cost of $4,500.31
 Lloyd's police department became the first in the county to purchase a Segway, in 2008, for the express purpose of patrolling the rail trail.32 In March 2009, Ulster County received almost $21 million in stimulus funds. The funding included a $3.16 million project to complete the trail between Lloyd and the Poughkeepsie Bridge.33 Construction for the az&quot; /&gt; section was underway by that September.34 In March 2010, a portion of New Paltz Road was closed pending the replacement of a bridge going over the trail.35
The official groundbreaking ceremony took place on May 4, 2010,36 and the trail was expected to be completed by October.37 The bridge over Vinyard Avenue was opened to pedestrian traffic on July 16, 2010. The only remaining obstruction was the placement of a bridge38 carrying Mile Hill Road over the trail,az&quot; /&gt; which was expected to be completed in August.39 The crossing at US 9W had been remedied; the new section let &quot;users to cross either over or under&quot; the highway.40 To celebrate the opening of the Vinyard Avenue bridge, Route 44/55 throughout Highland (which includes Vinyard Avenue) was shut down for a day.41 The eastern expansion was officially opened on October 2, 2010.42
Future expansion to the trail includes a  extension to the west, to NY 299. Lloyd has received a $1.93 million state grant to complete the western expansion,43 which will reach New Paltz by 2012.44 Both Lloyd and New Paltz have received grants to establish a connection between the Hudson Valley Rail Trail and the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail.45 There has never been a direct link between the Poughkeepsie Bridge and the Wallkill Valley corridor.46 Other plans include the development of commercial zones along the trail,47 and a project to connect the trail to Illinois Mountain.48
Route of the trail
The east&lt;U+2013&gt;west trail begins at the Poughkeepsie Bridge, by Haviland Road.49 The  Poughkeepsie Bridge was opened as a pedestrian walkway in 2009.50 The bridge is a National Recreation Trail, and connects to the Dutchess Rail Trail to the east.51
The Hudson Valley trail continues  west from the Poughkeepsie Bridge to a bridge over Mile Hill Road, then another  to a crossing at US 9W. At the  mark, the trail reaches a bridge over Vinyard Avenue. About  from the bridge, the trail crosses under New Paltz Road. Almost  from this road, the trail reaches the Black Creek Wetlands Complex, continuing on for an additional  to Tony Williams Park.52
There are four parking areas along the trail,53 by Haviland Road, Commercial Avenue, the Rotary pavilion, and at Tony Williams Park.54 The trail is  wide and  long; it is paved with asphalt and suitable for hiking, bicycling, horseback riding, roller blading, and cross country skiing.55
