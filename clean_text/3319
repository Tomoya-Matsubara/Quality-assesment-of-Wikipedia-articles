&quot;Slug&quot; is a song by Passengers, a group comprised of rock band U2 and producer Brian Eno. It was the second track on the group's only release, the 1995 album Original Soundtracks 1. The track was recorded early during the album sessions under the working title &quot;Seibu&quot;, but was laid aside and forgotten about until the sessions' end, where it was renamed &quot;Slug&quot;. Lyrically the song is a portrait of a desolate person during a time of celebration; this is set in contrast to the guitar notes, which depict the lights of a city at dusk being turned on in a manner akin to the lights of a Christmas tree.
Writing and recording
U2 and Brian Eno formed Passengers as a side-project during the recording sessions for U2's 1997 album Pop. The idea behind the group was to record a soundtrack for the 1996 film The Pillow Book as a warm up for Pop.1 Though the idea never came to fruition, Eno proposed that they continue recording for imaginary films. U2 were unsure of the idea at first, but they agreed when Eno told them that producing a series of radio hits was not the end goal.2
Part of the intent in writing Original Soundtracks 1 had been to make a &quot;night-time&quot; record.3 Musically &quot;Slug&quot; was written with the idea of the lights in Tokyo flickering on as day faded to dusk; lead vocalist Bono described the opening notes, which reflect this idea, as being &quot;like a Christmas Tree&quot;.4 The song's working title in the first recording sessions was &quot;Seibu&quot;, so named for the department store in Tokyo of the same name.5 After recording &quot;Seibu&quot; the band placed it to the side and quickly forgot about it as the sessions progressed. It was almost left off of the album, but towards the end of the recording sessions guitarist The Edge rediscovered the song when looking through other tracks that had been discarded. He replayed the track to Eno and the group subsequently decided to include it on Original Soundtracks 1, renaming it &quot;Slug&quot;.6 In keeping with the idea of writing for nonexistent films, in the liner notes of Original Soundtracks 1 &quot;Slug&quot; is credited as having been written for Slug.7
Bono wrote the lyrics of &quot;Slug&quot; in only five minutes, and though the verses are simple in nature they are also personal.8 They were developed from U2's experience at the end of the Zoo TV Tour in Japan. The band had toured for such a long time that all of the members were exhausted. Bono explained that the lyrics paint &quot;a portrait of somebody a little the worse for wear, which we all were in Tokyo, because it was the end of the tour. So tired you can't sleep. Wanting to go out to see what's going on in the city and not being able to stop yourself, though you should be looking after yourself better.&quot;9 Bono compared the lyrics in &quot;Slug&quot; to those in the 1991 U2 song &quot;Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World&quot; since both songs depict late-night life in a city.10 The lyrics also bear a similarity to their 1993 single &quot;Numb&quot;, as both songs utilize the negative command &quot;Don't&quot; at the beginning of most lyrics.11 The end result is a depiction of celebration set against the thoughts of a &quot;desolate soul&quot;, as echoed in the closing verse &quot;Don't want to change the frame / Don't want to be a pain / Don't want to stay the same&quot;, with an undercurrent of confusion regarding the differences in love and faith.1213 The line &quot;Don't want what I deserve&quot; was written by Bono as a jibe to himself, while the closing &quot;Don't want to stay the same&quot; depicts the band's determination to continue re-inventing themselves.14
Reception
Rolling Stone described &quot;Slug&quot; as one of the album's most engaging tracks, commenting that it could have been an outtake from U2's 1993 album Zooropa due to Bono's &quot;minimal crooning over skeletal backing tracks.&quot;15 Rating the song four stars out of five, Uncut reviewer Alastair McKay described the melody as &quot;clockwork&quot; while also noting that Eno's &quot;yen for melodic simplicity&quot; was evident.16 Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine selected &quot;Slug&quot; as one of four track picks from the album.17
