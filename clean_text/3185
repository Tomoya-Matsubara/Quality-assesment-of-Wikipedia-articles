Justine Joli (July 16 , 1980) is the stage name of an American adult model and pornographic actress.
Joli grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, splitting her summers between a farm in Hannibal and Crested Butte, Colorado.1 She was (and still is) a self described geek with a love of anime, science fiction, Macs and cartoons.2 She did ballet from age 3 to age 15,3 and was also active as a tagger in St. Louis with the handle &quot;Live&quot;.4
In 2000, Joli was working in a store called Sexcessories at the Glendale Galleria when she was noticed by porn director Kris Kramski and asked if she was interested in doing some modeling. Joli claims that Kramski's alterior motive was to get her into a threesome with he and his girlfriend, but that she was only interested in the girlfriend and not him.567 Jolie did not end up working with Kramski, but Kramski did pass her audition photos along to adult industry talent scout Roy Garcia, who promptly found work for her in adult modeling and films.8 She claims to have taken her mother to the casting and to her first shoot, which was with Stephen Hicks.9
At the beginning of her career, she worked extensively in men's magazines, appearing in numerous issues of Penthouse and Hustler, shooting six days a week for six months.10 After her rise as an adult film star, she has been a featured magazine model, including the cover of the March 2002 issue of Hustler and as the September 2007 Penthouse Pet of the Month.11 Her first film shoot was for Andrew Blake12 During her first several years in adult films, she appeared mainly under the name Swan, though in her appearances in Andrew Blake's films, she appeared simply as Justine. Eventually, she adopted the name Justine Joli.
Joli describes herself as bisexual and &quot;40% lesbian&quot; in real life and is particularly noted as a girl-girl actress in adult films. As of 2007, she has not done boy-girl scenes, stating &quot;I'm not comfortable doing boy/girl&quot;.13 Joli also appears alone in many movies and photosets, either as a glamour or fetish model or in solo masturbation scenes. She's also done some BDSM porn and in her personal life she has described herself as &quot;hardcore sub&quot;.14
