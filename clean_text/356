Lexus originated from a clandestine flagship car flagship sedan project, code-named F1, which began in 1983 and culminated in the launch of the original Lexus LS in 1989. Subsequently, the division added sedan car sedan, coup, convertible, and Sport utility vehicle SUV models. In 2005, a hybrid vehicle hybrid version of the Lexus RX RX crossover debuted, and additional hybrid models later joined the division's lineup. In 2007, Lexus launched its own Lexus#F marque F marque performance division with the debut of the Lexus IS F IS F sport sedan, followed by the Lexus LFA LFA supercar in 2009.

From the start of production, Lexus vehicles have been produced in Japan, with manufacturing centered in the Chbu region Chbu and Kysh regions, and in particular at Toyota's Tahara plant Tahara, Aichi Prefecture Aichi, Chbu and Miyata, Fukuoka Miyata, Fukuoka Prefecture Fukuoka, Kysh plants. Assembly of the first Lexus built outside the country, the Ontario, Canada-produced RX 330, began in 2003. Following a corporate reorganization from 2001 to 2005, Lexus also operates its own automotive design design, automotive engineering engineering, and manufacturing centers, solely responsible for the division's vehicles.

Since the 2000s, Lexus has increased sales outside its largest market in the United States through an ongoing global expansion. The division inaugurated Car dealership dealerships in Japan's Japanese domestic market domestic market in 2005, becoming the first Japanese premium car marque to launch in its country of origin. Further debuts in Southeast Asia, Latin America, Europe, and other  export regions have since followed. The division's lineup has also been expanded to reflect regional specifications in model and powertrain configurations.

 History 

 1980s: The F1 project 
In 1983, Toyota chairman Eiji Toyoda summoned a secret meeting of company executives, to whom he posed the question, Can we create a luxury vehicle to challenge the world's best?Harvnb May 2006 p=43 This question prompted Toyota to embark on a top-secret project, code-named F1 Flagship One.Harvnb May 2006 p=42 The F1 project, whose finished product was ultimately the Lexus LS Lexus LS 400, aimed to develop a flagship sedan that would expand Toyotas product line, giving it a foothold in the premium segment and offering both longtime and new customers an upmarket product.cite web url=http://www.autolinedetroit.tv/autoline/watch.php?stream=927 title=How Lexus Was Successful in the U.S. interview year=2006 format=WMV last=Press first=Jim accessdate=2006 publisher=Auto Line Detroit The F1 project followed the success of the Toyota Supra sports car and the premium Toyota Cressida models.White, John. New Route for Japanese Cars: Luxury. The Boston Globe. 1989-10-23 Both the Supra and Cressida were rear-wheel drive cars with a powerful Toyota 7M-GE 7M-GE/7M-GTE inline-six engine. The largest sedan Toyota built at the time was the limited-production, 1960s-vintage Toyota Century, its domestic, hand built, limousine flagship and sole V8-powered model, followed by the inline-six-engined Toyota Crown premium sedan.Harvnb Dawson 2004 pp=67, 63Harvnb Long 2001 pp=1621 The Century was conservatively styled for the Japanese market, and along with the Crown not slated for export. F1 designers targeted their new sedan at international markets and began development on a new V8 engine.

The opportunity for Japanese manufacturers to export more expensive models had grown in the 1980s due to Voluntary Export Restraints voluntary export restraints, negotiated by the Japanese government and U.S. trade representatives, restricting mainstream car sales.Harvnb Dawson 2004 pp=xix, 28 In 1986, Honda launched its Acura marque in the U.S., influencing Toyota's plans for a luxury division;Harvnb Dawson 2004 p=109 the initial Acura model was an export version of the Honda Legend, itself launched in Japan in 1985 as a rival to the Toyota Crown, Nissan Cedric/Nissan Gloria Gloria and Mazda Luce.cite web url= http://www.zakzak.co.jp/society/domestic/news/20100716/dms1007161623011-n2.htm title=Honda's premium sedan, Legend language=Japanese work=Sankei Shimbun date=2010-07-16 accessdate=2011-01-31 In 1987, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Nissan unveiled its plans for a premium brand, Infiniti,Harvnb Dawson 2004 pp=72, 88, 116 and revised its flagship Nissan President sedan in standard wheelbase form for export as the Infiniti Q45, which it launched in 1990.cite web url=http://gazoo.com/meishakan/meisha/shousai.asp?R_ID=5498&ex_spec=shousai title=Profile: 1990 Nissan President language=Japanese publisher=Gazoo accessdate=2011-01-31 year=2011 In 1988, Mazda began selling the Luce as the Mazda 929 in North America, and later began plans to develop an upscale marque, to be called Mazda#Marques Amati, but its plans did not come to fruition.

Toyota researchers visited the U.S. in May 1985 to conduct focus groups and market research on luxury consumers.Harvnb Dawson 2004 pp=35, 41 During that time, several F1 designers rented a home in Laguna Beach, California to observe the lifestyles and tastes of American upper class consumers. Meanwhile, F1 engineering teams conducted prototype testing on locations ranging from the German autobahn to U.S. roads.cite web url=http://www.edmunds.com/lexus/ title=Edmunds.com Lexus Overview publisher=Edmunds.com accessdate=2011-05-23 Toyotas market research concluded that a separate brand name brand and sales channel were needed to present its new flagship sedan, and plans were made to develop a new network of dealerships in the U.S. market.Harvnb Morgan Liker 2006 p=121

In 1986, Toyotas longtime advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi formed a specialized unit, Team One, to handle marketing for the new premium brand. Image consulting firm Lippincott Mercer Lippincott & Margulies was hired to develop a list of 219 prospective names; Vectre, Verone, Chaparel, Calibre and Alexis were chosen as top candidates.Harvnb Mahler 2004 pp=5657 While Alexis quickly became the front runner, concerns were raised that the name applied to people more than cars being associated with the Alexis Carrington character on the popular 1980s primetime drama Dynasty TV series Dynasty, and as a result the first letter was removed and the i replaced with a u to morph the name to Lexus.Harvnb Dawson 2004 pp=111

The etymology of the Lexus name has been attributed to the combination of the words luxury and elegance,cite news url=http://www.forbes.com/facesinthenews/2005/07/26/toyota-lexus-autos-cx_cn_0726autofacescan02.html title=Watanabe's Toyota Rolls Out Lexus In Japan date=2005-07-26 work=Forbes last=Noon first=Chris accessdate=2008-06-05 and another theory claims it is an acronym for luxury exports to the U.S. According to Team One interviews, the brand name has no specific meaning and simply denotes a luxurious and technological image. Just prior to the release of the first vehicles, database service LexisNexis obtained a temporary injunction forbidding the name Lexus from being used as they stated it might cause confusion.Harvnb Dawson 2004 pp=12830 The injunction threatened to delay the division's launch and marketing efforts. Upon reflection, a U.S. appeals court lifted the injunction, deciding that there was little likelihood of confusion between the two products.

The original Lexus slogan, developed after Team One representatives visited Lexus designers in Japan and noted an obsessive attention to detail, became The Relentless Pursuit of Perfection.Harvnb Dawson 2004 pp=11314 The Lexus logo was developed by Molly Designs and Hunter Communications.cite web url=http://www.mollydesigns.com/history.html title=Molly Designs history, Lexus logo design publisher=Molly Designs archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080611081501/http://www.mollydesigns.com/history.html archivedate=2008-06-11cite web url=http://huntercommunications.com/HCmain/company/lexus.html title=An Enduring Symbol of Excellence publisher=Hunter Communications archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/2003040715380/http://huntercommunications.com/HCmain/company/lexus.html archivedate=2003-04-07 The final design for the Lexus logo featured a stylized L within an oval, and according to Toyota, was rendered using a precise mathematical formula. The first teaser ads featuring the Lexus name and logo, designed by Team One, appeared at the Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York auto shows in 1988.Harvnb Dawson 2004 p=115

In December 1989, Lexus initiated a voluntary recall of all 8,000 LS 400s sold to date, based upon two customer complaints over defective wiring and an overheated brake light. In a sweeping 20-day operation which replaced the parts on all affected vehicles, Lexus sent technicians to pick up, repair, and return cars to customers free of charge, and also flew in personnel and rented garage space for owners in remote locations.

Interviews with retired division officials indicate that depending on sales volume, vehicle product development cycles, and exchange rates, Lexus sales have accounted for as much as half of Toyota's annual U.S. profit in certain years. Division executives have employed pricing strategies aimed at sustaining profit margins rather than sales volume, with historically fewer price incentives than rival brands.

Model nomenclature
Lexus production models are named alphanumerically using two-letter designations followed by three digits. The first letter indicates relative status in the Lexus model range ranking,cite news url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/09/07/pf/autos/car_name_decoder/ title=Car name decoder date=2004-09-11 publisher=CNN accessdate=2009-02-01 last=Valdes-Dapena first=Peter and the second letter refers to car body style or type e.g. LS for 'luxury sedan'. The three digits indicate engine displacement in liters multiplied by a factor of one hundred e.g. 350 for a 3.5 L engine. A space is used between the letters and numbers. The same letter may be used differently depending on the model; 'S' can refer to 'sedan' or 'sport'cite web url=http://www.nihoncar.com/en/review-292-Lexus+IS250+Test+Drive,+HDTV.html archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090603165332/http://www.nihoncar.com/en/review-292-Lexus+IS250+Test+Drive%2C+HDTV.html archivedate=2009-06-03 title=Lexus IS250 Test Drive publisher=Nihoncar.com date=2006-08-06 accessdate=2009-02-01 e.g. in LS and SC, while 'X' refers to 'sport utility vehicle luxury utility vehicle' or SUV.cite web url=http://www.businessweek.com/autos/content/feb2007/bw20070214_857806.htm title=Sales of Foreign Autos Climb work=BusinessWeek date=2007-02-14 accessdate=2009-02-01 On hybrids, the three digits refer to the combined gasoline-electric output. For certain models, a lower case letter placed after the alphanumeric designation indicates powerplant type 'h' for hybrid, 'd' for diesel, while capital letters placed at the end indicates a class subtype e.g. 'L' for long-wheelbase, 'C' for coupe, 'AWD' for all-wheel drive. On F marque models, the two-letter designation and the letter 'F' are used with no numbers or hyphens e.g. IS F.

Industry observers have attributed Lexus' early marketing successes to higher levels of perceived quality and lower prices than competitors, which have enabled the marque to attract customers upgrading from mass-market cars.
