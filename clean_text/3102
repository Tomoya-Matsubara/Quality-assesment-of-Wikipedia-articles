I am not Lorena, (Spanish: &quot;No Soy Lorena&quot;) is a  Chilean film directed by Isidora Marras, written by Isidora Marras and Catalina Calcagni and produced by Josefina Undurraga and Gregorio Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez 1 Filmed in Chile, I am not Lorena is a drama/thriller and is Isidora Marras' debut feature film.2
Plot
The story is centered on Olivia, an actress in her late twenties who has recently broken up with her boyfriend Mauro, a theatre director. But despite the breakup, Olivia accepts a part in a play directed by Mauro. Things do not go well, either in her life or in the play, where she is unable to achieve what a demanding Mauro is asking of her.3
Things get worse when Olivia starts to receive an increasing number of harassing phone calls. She has been mistaken for Lorena Ruiz, a woman with lots of debts whose creditors will not believe they have got the wrong person. The harassment continues, and the case of mistaken identity becomes a living Kafkaesque nightmare for Olivia as she searches for the mysterious Lorena Ruiz.
Director Isidora Marras was inspired by a case of mistaken identity that she herself suffered. The film is the portrait of a bureaucratic and dehumanised system where people are no more than consumers.4
