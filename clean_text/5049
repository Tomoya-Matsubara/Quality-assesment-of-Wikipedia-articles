William Ellery Sweet (January 27, 1869-May 9, 1942) was the 23rd Governor of Colorado from 1923-1925.
Early life and career
William was born in Chicago, Illinois on January 27, 1869 to Channing and Emeroy Sweet. His family moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado in 1872 when William was two. He attended school there, and graduated from high school in 1887. After high school, he went to college in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at Swarthmore College. He graduated from Swarthmore in 1890, after three years attending, and got his Bachelor Degree.
On October 19, 1892, Sweet married Joyeuse L. Fullerton in Philadelphia. After their marriage, William moved to Denver. He decided to start up an investment banking firm, which led the Sweet family to become wealthy, and even let William to retire in 1922. He donated much of his money to charities, including the Denver YMCA.
It wasn't until 1922, that he became active in politics. He joined the Democratic Party, and he gained most of his support from the farm and labor groups. He was a strong advocate against the Ku Klux Klan, which he believed why he lost the following election to Clarence Morley, because they were a major influence on Colorado politics at the time.
Sweet made two unsuccessful attempts to run for the U.S. Senate in 1926 and 1936.
In the final years of his life, William was a proud supporter of the Progressive Party, and even supported Herbert Hoover's bid for President.
He died on May 9, 1942 in his Denver home.
