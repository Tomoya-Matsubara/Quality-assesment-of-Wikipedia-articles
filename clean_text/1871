This is a discography of The Libertines, a London, England-based indie rock band. The Libertines, who formed in 1997, consisted of Pete Doherty (vocals/rhythm guitar), Carl Bar&lt;U+00E2&gt;t (vocals/lead guitar), John Hassall (bass) and Gary Powell (drums). The band have released two studio albums, four extended plays (EPs), one compilation album, six singles and six music videos. This list does not include material performed by members of The Libertines that was recorded with Babyshambles, Dirty Pretty Things, Yeti, The Streets, Littl'ans, Client, The Chavs or Razorlight.
The Libertines were formed by frontmen Doherty and Bar&lt;U+00E2&gt;t in 1998. The band released their first single &quot;What a Waster&quot; in June 2002 on Rough Trade records. The single broke into the UK Top 40, and earned the band acclaim from the British music press.1 The Libertines followed up with their debut full-length album Up the Bracket in October 2002. Although Up the Bracket only peaked at number thirty-five in the UK, the album was critically-acclaimed,2 and rated as one of the the year's best by many publications .3 Two singles were released to support the album; &quot;Up the Bracket&quot;, which reached number twenty-nine in the UK, and &quot;Time for Heroes&quot;, which peaked at the twentieth spot. In August 2003, The Libertines released their fourth single, &quot;Don't Look Back into the Sun&quot;. It was their highest-charting effort so far, reaching number eleven. The band's self-titled second album The Libertines was released a year later in August 2004. The album debuted at the top of the British charts, helped by lead single &quot;Can't Stand Me Now&quot;, which hit number two. The Libertines, which was certified platinum in the UK, saw the band chart in the United States for the first time, peaking at number 111 on the Billboard 200. However the album was to be the band's last, as they soon disbanded after due to Doherty's substance abuse problems, run-ins with the law and disagreements with Bar&lt;U+00E2&gt;t.45 In 2007, Rough Trade issued a greatest hits compilation, Time for Heroes - The Best of The Libertines, which reached number twenty-three in the UK.6
