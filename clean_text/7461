This article refers to a period of history of Czechoslovakia. For the music festival see Prague Spring Music Festival.


The Prague Spring (Czech: Pra&lt;U+017E&gt;sk&lt;U+00E9&gt; jaro, Slovak: Pra&lt;U+017E&gt;sk&lt;U+00E1&gt; jar, Polish: praska wiosna) was a period of political liberalization in Czechoslovakia starting January 5 1968 when Alexander Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek came to power, and running until August 20 of that year when the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies (except for Romania) invaded the country.
The term Prague Spring was coined by Western media after the event became known worldwide, and was eventually adopted in Czechoslovakia itself. It made reference to the Springtime of Peoples, a lyrical title given to the Revolutions of 1848.
Spring reforms

Alexander Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek

In the early 1960s, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (&lt;U+010C&gt;SSR) underwent an economic downturn, and in early 1968, Anton&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Novotn&lt;U+00FD&gt; lost control of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KS&lt;U+010C&gt;) to Alexander Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek. On 22 March 1968, Novotn&lt;U+00FD&gt; resigned as president, to be replaced by Ludvik Svoboda.
In April, Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek launched an &quot;Action Programme&quot; of liberalisations which included increased freedom of the press, emphasis on consumer goods, and the possibilty of a more democratic multi-party government. It also planned the federalisation of the &lt;U+010C&gt;SSR into two equal nations.
Although the Action Programme stipulated that reform must proceed under KS&lt;U+010C&gt; direction, popular pressure mounted to implement reforms forthwith. Radical elements found expression: anti-Soviet polemics appeared in the press; the Social Democrats began to form a separate party; new unaffiliated political clubs were created. Party conservatives urged the implementation of repressive measures, but Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek counselled moderation and reemphasized KS&lt;U+010C&gt; leadership. In May, he announced that the Fourteenth Party Congress would convene in an early session on September 9. The congress would incorporate the Action Program into the party statutes, draft a federalization law, and elect a new Central Committee.
On June 27, Ludv&lt;U+00ED&gt;k Vacul&lt;U+00ED&gt;k, a lifelong communist and a candidate member of the Central Committee, published a manifesto entitled &quot;Two Thousand Words&quot;. The manifesto expressed concern about conservative elements within the KS&lt;U+010C&gt; and &quot;foreign&quot; forces as well. Warsaw Pact military practice maneuvers were being held in Czechoslovakia in late June. It called on the &quot;people&quot; to take the initiative in implementing the reform program. Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek, the party Presidium, the National Front, and the cabinet sharply denounced the manifesto.
Negotiations with the Soviets
Leonid Brezhnev and the leadership of the Warsaw Pact countries (except Romania), were concerned about Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek's reforms, which they feared weakened the position of the Communist Bloc during the Cold War.
The Soviet leadership at first tried to stop or limit the changes in the &lt;U+010C&gt;SSR through a series of negotiations . The Soviet Union agreed to bilateral talks with Czechoslovakia to be held in July at &lt;U+010C&gt;ierna nad Tisou, near the Slovak-Soviet border. At the meeting, Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek defended the program of the reformist wing of the KS&lt;U+010C&gt; while pledging commitment to the Warsaw Pact and Comecon. The KS&lt;U+010C&gt; leadership, however, was divided between vigorous reformers (Josef Smrkovsk&lt;U+00FD&gt;, Old&lt;U+0159&gt;ich &lt;U+010C&gt;ern&lt;U+00ED&gt;k, and Franti&lt;U+0161&gt;ek Kriegel) who supported Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek, and conservatives (Vasil Bi&lt;U+013E&gt;ak, Drahom&lt;U+00ED&gt;r Kolder, and Old&lt;U+0159&gt;ich &lt;U+0160&gt;vestka) who adopted an anti-reformist stance. Brezhnev decided on compromise. The KS&lt;U+010C&gt; delegates reaffirmed their loyalty to the Warsaw Pact and promised to curb &quot;antisocialist&quot; tendencies, prevent the revival of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party, and control the press more effectively. The Soviets agreed to withdraw their troops (still stationed in Czechoslovakia since the June maneuvers) and permit the September 9 party congress.
On August 3, representatives from the Soviet Union, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia met in Bratislava and signed the Bratislava Declaration. The declaration affirmed unshakable fidelity to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism and declared an implacable struggle against &quot;bourgeois&quot; ideology and all &quot;antisocialist&quot; forces. The Soviet Union expressed its intention to intervene in a Warsaw Pact country if a &quot;bourgeois&quot; system&lt;U+2014&gt;a pluralist system of several political parties&lt;U+2014&gt;was ever established. After the Bratislava conference, Soviet troops left Czechoslovak territory but remained along Czechoslovak borders.
As these talks proved unsatisfactory, the Soviets began to consider a military alternative.
The policy of the Soviet Union to demand the socialist governments of its Satellite states subordinate their national interests to those of the &quot;Communist Commonwealth&quot; (through military force if needed) became known as the Brezhnev Doctrine.
Occupation

The memorial plate in Ko&lt;U+0161&gt;ice, Slovakia

Between the nights of August 20 and August 21 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from five Warsaw Pact countries invaded the &lt;U+010C&gt;SSR. During the invasion, Soviet tanks ranging in numbers from 5,000 to 7,000 occupied the streets. They were followed by a large number of Warsaw Pact troops ranging from 200,000 to 600,000.
During the attack of the Warsaw Pact armies, 72 Czechs and Slovaks were killed (19 of those in Slovakia) and hundreds were wounded (up to September 3, 1968). Alexander Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek called upon his people not to resist. He was arrested and taken to Moscow, along with several of his colleagues.
The occupation was followed by a wave of emigration (estimate: 70,000 immediately, 300,000 in total1), typically of highly qualified people. Western countries allowed these people to stay and work without complications.
Letter of invitation
Although on the night of the invasion, the Czechoslovak Presidium declared that Warsaw Pact troops had crossed the border without knowledge of the &lt;U+010C&gt;SSR Government, the Soviet Press printed an unsigned request, allegedly by Czechoslovak party and state leaders, for &quot;immediate assistance, including assistance with armed forces.&quot; 2At the 14th CPCz Party Congress (conducted secretly, immediately following the intervention), it was emphasised that no member of the leadership had invited the intervention. At the time, a number of commentators believed the letter was fake or non-existent.
In the early 1990s, however, the Russian government gave the new Czech President, V&lt;U+00E1&gt;clav Havel, a copy of a letter of invitation addressed to Soviet authorities and signed by CPCz members Bil&lt;U+2019&gt;ak, &lt;U+0160&gt;vestka, Kolder, Indra, and Kapek. It claimed that &lt;U+201C&gt;right-wing&lt;U+201D&gt; media were &lt;U+201C&gt;fomenting a wave of nationalism and chauvinism, and are provoking an anti-communist and anti-Soviet psychosis.&lt;U+201D&gt; It formally asked the Soviets to &lt;U+201C&gt;lend support and assistance with all means at your disposal&lt;U+201D&gt; to save the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic &lt;U+201C&gt;from the imminent danger of counterrevolution.&lt;U+201D&gt;3 A 1992 Izvestia article claimed that candidate Presidium member Antonin Kapek gave Leonid Brezhnev a letter at the Soviet-Czechoslovak &lt;U+010C&gt;iern&lt;U+00E1&gt; nad Tisou talks in late July which appealed for &lt;U+201C&gt;fraternal help.&lt;U+201D&gt; A second letter was supposedly delivered by Bil&lt;U+2019&gt;ak to Ukrainian Party leader Petro Shelest during the August Bratislava conference &lt;U+201C&gt;in a lavatory rendezvous arranged through the KGB station chief.&lt;U+201D&gt;4 This letter was signed by the same five as Havel&lt;U+2019&gt;s letter, mentioned above.
Internal plot
Long before the invasion, planning for a coup was understaken by Indra, Kolder and Bil&lt;U+2019&gt;ak, among others, often at the Soviet embassy and at the Party recreation centre in Orl&lt;U+00ED&gt;k.5 When these men had managed to convince a majority of the Presidium (six of eleven voting members) to side with them against Alexander Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek&lt;U+2019&gt;s reformists, they asked the Soviets to launch a military invasion. The Soviets were even considering waiting until the August 26 Slovak Party Congress, but the Czechoslovak conspirators &lt;U+201C&gt;specifically requested the night of the 20th.&lt;U+201D&gt;6 The plan was to unfold as follows. A debate would unfold in response to the Ka&lt;U+0161&gt;par report on the state of the country, during which conservative members would insist that Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek present two letters he had received from the Soviets, letters which listed promises he had made at the &lt;U+010C&gt;iern&lt;U+00E1&gt; nad Tisou talks but had failed to keep. Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek&lt;U+2019&gt;s concealment of such important letters, and his unwillingess to keep his promises would lead to a vote of confidence which the now conservative majority would win, seizing power, and issue a request for Soviet assistance in preventing a counterrevolution. It was this formal request, drafted in Moscow, which was published in Pravda on August 22 without the signatories. All the Soviets needed to do was suppress the Czechoslovak military and any violent resistance. With this plan in mind, the August 16-17 Politburo meeting passed a resolution to &lt;U+201C&gt;provide help to the Communist Party and people of Czechoslovakia through military force.&lt;U+201D&gt;7 At the August 18 Warsaw Pact meeting, Brezhnev announced that the intervention would go ahead on the night of August 20, and asked for &quot;fraternal support&quot;, which the national leaders of Bulgaria, East Germany, Hungary, and Poland duly offered.
Reactions in Czechoslovakia
Popular opposition was expressed in numerous spontaneous acts of nonviolent resistance. In Prague and other cities throughout the republic, Czechs and Slovaks greeted Warsaw Pact soldiers with arguments and reproaches. Every form of assistance, including the provision of food and water, was denied the invaders. Signs, placards, and graffiti drawn on walls and pavements denounced the invaders, the Soviet leaders, and suspected collaborators. Pictures of Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek and Svoboda appeared everywhere.
The generalized resistance caused the Soviet Union to abandon its original plan to oust the First Secretary. Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek, who had been arrested on the night of August 20, was taken to Moscow for negotiations. It was agreed that Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek would remain in office and that a program of moderate reform would continue.
On January 19, 1969, student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Prague's Wenceslas Square to protest the renewed suppression of free speech. Finally, in April 1969, Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek was replaced as First Secretary by Gust&lt;U+00E1&gt;v Hus&lt;U+00E1&gt;k, and a period of &quot;Normalisation&quot; began. Hus&lt;U+00E1&gt;k reversed Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek's reforms and purged the party of its liberal members.
Reactions around the world
The democratic countries offered only vocal criticism following the invasion &lt;U+2014&gt; the reality of nuclear standoff in the Cold War meant the Western countries were in no position to challenge Soviet military force in Central Europe. A more pronounced effect took place in Communist Romania, where leader Nicolae Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu, already a staunch opponent of Soviet influences and one to have declared himself on Dub&lt;U+010D&gt;ek's side, held a public speech in Bucharest on the day of the invasion, depicting Soviet policies in harsh terms. While Romania engaged briefly on the same side of the barricade as Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslavia, the alliance was purely conjectural (as Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu was already proving to be opposed on principle to Socialism with a human face). It did however consolidate Romania's independent voice the next decades, especially after Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu encouraged the population to take up arms in order to meet any similar manoeuvre in that country: he received an enthusiastic initial response, with many people who were by no means communist willing to enroll in the newly-formed paramilitary Patriotic Guards.
In Finland, a country under huge Soviet political influence at that time, the occupation caused a major scandal. Like the Italian and French Communist Parties, the Communist Party of Finland denounced the occupation. Nonetheless, Finnish president Urho Kekkonen was the very first Western politician to officially visit Czechoslovakia after August 1968; he received the highest Czechoslovakian honours from the hands of president Ludv&lt;U+00ED&gt;k Svoboda, on October 4, 1969.
Portuguese communist secretary-general &lt;U+00C1&gt;lvaro Cunhal is believed to have been the only from western Europe to have suported the invasion for being counterrevolutionary.
Legacy
The events of the Prague Spring deepened the disillusion of many Western leftists with Leninist views, and contributed to the growth of Eurocommunist ideas in Western communist parties &lt;U+2014&gt; leading to the eventual dissolution or break-up of many of these groups.
A decade later, the Prague Spring lent its name to an analogous period of Chinese political liberalization known as the Beijing Spring. It also partly influenced the Croatian Spring in Yugoslavia.
