SM U-40 or U-XL was a U-27 class submarine Austria-Hungary U-27 class U-boat or submarine for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. U-40, built by the Austrian firm of Cantiere Navale Triestino CNT at the Pola Navy Yard, was launch ship launched in April 1917 and commission ship commissioned in August.

She had a single submarine hull hull and was just over convert 121 ft m in length. She displacement ship displaced nearly convert 265 MT LT 0 when surfaced and over convert 300 MT LT 0 when submerged. Her two diesel engines moved her at up to convert 9 knots km/h on the surface, while her twin electric motors propelled her at up to convert 7.5 knots km/h while underwater. She was armed with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry a load of up to four torpedoes. She was also equipped with a convert 75 mm in 1 adj=on abbr=on deck gun and a machine gun.

During her service career, U-40 sank three ships and damaged two others, sending a combined tonnage of GRT 9,838 first=short to the bottom. U-40 was at Fiume at war's end and was surrendered at Venice in March 1919. She was granted to Italy as a war reparation and broken up the following year. 

 Design and construction 
Austria-Hungary's U-boat fleet was largely obsolete at the outbreak of World War I.Gardiner, p. 341. The Austro-Hungarian Navy satisfied its most urgent needs by purchasing five German Type UB I submarine Type UB I submarines that comprised the sclass U-10 submarine 4 from Germany,Gardiner, p. 343. by raising and recommissioning the sunken French submarine French submarine Curie Q 87 Curie as SMS U-14 Austria-Hungary 2 sub=y,French submarine Curie Q 87 Curie had been caught in an anti-submarine net while trying to enter the harbor at Pula Pola on 20 December 1914. See: Gardiner, p. 343. and by building four submarines of the sclass U-20 submarine 4 that were based on the 1911 Danish Havmanden class submarine 1911 Havmanden class.Gardiner, p. 344.The plans for the Danish Havmanden class submarine 1911 Havmanden class submarines, three of which were built in Austria-Hungary, were seized from Whitehead & Co. in Fiume. See: Gardiner, pp. 344, 354.

After these steps alleviated their most urgent needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II submarine German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915.Halpern, p. 383. The Germans were reluctant to allocate any of their wartime resources to Austro-Hungarian construction, but were willing to sell plans for up to six of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria-Hungary. The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from AG Weser of Bremen.Baumgartner and Sieche, as excerpted http://www.gwpda.org/naval/ahsubs.htm here reprinted and translated into English by Sieche. Retrieved 1 December 2008.

U-40 displaced convert 264 MT LT surfaced and convert 301 MT LT submerged. She had a single submarine hull hull with saddle tanks,Gardiner, p. 181. and was convert 121 ft 1 in m long with a beam nautical beam of convert 14 ft 4 in m and a draft hull draft of convert 12 ft 2 in m. For propulsion, she had two shafts, twin diesel engines of convert 270 bhp abbr=on for surface running, and twin electric motors of convert 280 shp abbr=on for submerged travel. She was capable of convert 9 knots km/h 1 while surfaced and convert 7.5 knots km/h while submerged. Although there is no specific notation of a range for U-40 in Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 19061921, the German UB II boats, upon which the U-27 class was based, had a range of over convert 6000 nmi km at convert 5 knots km/h surfaced, and convert 45 nmi km at convert 4 knots km/h submerged. U-27-class boats were designed for a crew of 2324.

U-40 was armed with two convert 45 cm in 1 abbr=on bow torpedo tubes and could carry a complement of four torpedoes. She was also equipped with a 75mm/26 3.0in deck gun and an convert 8 mm in abbr=on machine gun.

U-40 was ordered from Cantiere Navale Triestino CNT after funds for her purchase were raised and donated to the Austro-Hungarian Navy by the stereichischen Flottenverein. She was keel laying laid down on 8 August 1916 at the Pola Navy Yard,By this time, the Cantiere Navale Triestino CNT shipyards at Monfalcone had been overrun by the Italian Army. See: Baumgartner and Sieche, as excerpted http://www.gwpda.org/naval/ahsubs.htm here reprinted and translated into English by Sieche. Retrieved 17 January 2008. and launch ship launched on 21 April 1917.

 Service career 
U-40 underwent diving trials on 3 July 1917, successfully reaching a depth of convert 50 m ft. One mont later, on 4 August, the SM U-40 was commission ship commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy under the command of Linenschiffleutnant Johann Krsnjavi. Previously in command of SMS U-11 Austria-Hungary 2 sub=y, Krsnjavi was a 30-year-old native of Djakovo the present-day akovo in Croatia.cite web   last = Helgason   first = Gumundur   title = WWI U-boat commanders: Johann Krsnjavi   url = http://uboat.net/wwi/men/commanders/518.html   work = U-Boat War in World War I   date =    accessdaymonth = 20 January   accessyear = 2009 

U-40 departed on her first patrol on 5 August, sailing through the Brijuni Brioni islands. Two days out, the submarine came under attack by two airplanes. Bombs from the two aircraft damaged one of U-40's fuel tanks but the U-boat was able to continue to her Mediterranean patrol area. There, east of Malta, she unsuccessfully attacked a steamer on the 15th. Four days latera little more than two weeks after the U-boat's commissioningKrsnjavi and U-40 achieved their first kills. Gartness, a British steamer of GRT 2,422 first=yes, was transporting manganese ore, lean, and arsenic from Ergasteria for Middlesbrough when torpedoed by U-40 some convert 140 nmi km southeast of Malta.cite web   last = Helgason   first = Gumundur   title = Ships hit during WWI: Gartness   url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/2382.html   work = U-Boat War in World War I   publisher = Uboat.net   date =    accessdaymonth = 21 January   accessyear = 2009  The ship's captain nautical master and twelve other crewmen were killed in the attack.Tennent, p. 229.

Ten days later, after a rendezvous with sister boat SMS U-32 Austria-Hungary 2 sub=y in the Ionian Sea, U-40 damaged the collier ship collier Clifftower in an torpedo attack. Clifftower, carrying a load of coal from Newcastle, suffered no casualties in the attack.cite web   last = Helgason   first = Gumundur   title = Ships hit during WWI: Clifftower   url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/1357.html   work = U-Boat War in World War I   publisher = Uboat.net   date =    accessdaymonth = 21 January   accessyear = 2009  After successfully passing through the Otranto Barrage on 31 August, U-40 concluded her first patrol when she docked at Cattaro on 3 September.

On 15 October, U-40 set out from Cattaro on her next patrol. She spent two days, 16 to 18 October, patrolling off Durazzo. Departing there, she headed for her assigned patrol area off Port Said. On 20 October, two airplanes from Corfu forced Krsnjavi to make an emergency dive, but the U-boat escaped damage. On 25 October, U-40  encountered a severe storm that damager one of her fuel tanks. Three days later, Krsnjavi ordered the boat back to port when the gyrocompass broke. The boat made Cattaro on 1 November and underwent repairs there over the five weeks.

Departing from Cattaro on her third patrol on 10 December, Krsnjavi steered the boat to her patrol area: cruising the Mediterranean between Alexandria and Malta. The first day of the new year brought U-40's next success. On 1 January 1918, the GRT 5,134 Sandon Hall, a British steamer headed from Basra to London with a cargo linseed oil and date fruit dates, was sent to the bottom convert 22 nmi km north-northeast of Linosa.cite web   last = Helgason   first = Gumundur   title = Ships hit during WWI: Sandon Hall   url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/5422.html   work = U-Boat War in World War I   publisher = Uboat.net   date =    accessdaymonth = 21 January   accessyear = 2009  A torpedo attack two days later on another steamer produced no result. Having exhausted her supply of torpedoes, U-40 headed back to port. On 6 January, the U-boats deck gun was used to destroy a floating mine naval mine. The following day the boat was fired upon by three drifter fishing boat drifters of the Otranto Barrage but safely returned to Cattaro on 8 January.

After two month at Cattaro, Krsnjavi lead U-40 out on her fourth patrol on 5 March. The U-boat came under attack on consecutive days while headed into the Mediterranean. On 9 March, two destroyers forced her to crash dive, while the following day a pair of airplanes did the same. Nine days later, U-40 torpedoed the Canadian steamer Lord Ormonde, but only damaged the 3,914-ton ship.cite web   last = Helgason   first = Gumundur   title = Ships hit during WWI: Lord Ormonde d.   url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/3695.html   work = U-Boat War in World War I   publisher = Uboat.net   date =    accessdaymonth = 21 January   accessyear = 2009  On 20 March, U-40 sent the Greek cargo ship Antonios M. Theophilatos and her load of ammunition to the bottom.Uboat.net attributes the sinking of Antonios M. Theophilatos to the German U-boat SMS U-33  2 sub=y, which was operating in the same area. See: cite web   last = Helgason   first = Gumundur   title = Ships hit during WWI: Antonios M. Theophilatos   url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/377.html   work = U-Boat War in World War I   publisher = Uboat.net   date =    accessdaymonth = 21 January   accessyear = 2009  U-40 launched an unsuccessful torpedo attack on a steamer in a convoy on 23 March.Uboat.net reports that the only ship torpedoed in the whole of the Mediterranean on 23 March 1918 was the British steamer Demodocus, which was damaged in an attack by the German submarine SMS UC-53  2 sub=y. U-40 ended her patrol on 2 April at Cattaro. Gibson and Prendergast report on the claim of the Italian torpedo boat ship Italian torpedo boat Ardea  2 that she had depth charged and sunk U-40 in the Adriatic on 26 April. As Gibson and Prendergast note, U-40 did not sink that day, discrediting the report.Gibson and Prendergast, p. 268. U-40 did depart from Cattaro for Pola at the end of May to undergo repairs for the next two months.

U-40 departed from Pola on 5 August, but developed a leak a few days out and put in at Cattaro on 10 August. The U-boat returned to Pola about two weeks later and remained there until October. While at Pola, command of U-40 passed to Linenschiffleutnant Wladimir Pfeifer on 19 September. The 27-year-old native of Leskovec in present-day Slovenia, was previously in command of SMS U-17 Austria-Hungary 2 sub=y and had, like Krsnjavi, also served a stint as commander of U-11.cite web   last = Helgason   first = Gumundur   title = WWI U-boat commanders: Wladimir Pfeifer   url = http://uboat.net/wwi/men/commanders/527.html   work = U-Boat War in World War I   date =    accessdaymonth = 20 January   accessyear = 2009 

On 19 October, U-40 departed Pola and eventually arrived at Fiume, where she remained through the end of the war. The U-boat was taken to Venice on 23 March 1919, where she was surrendered to the Italians as a war reparation. She was scrapped at Venice the following year. In her 15-month service career, U-40 sank three ships with a combined tonnage of 9,838, and damaged two others.
