Miller James Huggins (March 27, 1879 &lt;U+2013&gt; September 25, 1929) was an American professional baseball player and manager. A second baseman, Huggins played in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds (1904&lt;U+2013&gt;1909) and St. Louis Cardinals (1910&lt;U+2013&gt;1916). He managed the Cardinals (1913&lt;U+2013&gt;1917) and New York Yankees (1918&lt;U+2013&gt;1929), including the Murderers' Row teams of the 1920s that won six American League (AL) pennants and three World Series championships.
Huggins was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. He received a degree in law from the University of Cincinnati, where he was also captain on the baseball team. Rather than serve as a lawyer, Huggins chose to pursue a professional baseball career. He played semi-professional and minor league baseball from 1898 through 1903, at which time he signed with the Reds.
As a player, Huggins was adept at getting on base. He was also an excellent fielding second baseman, earning the nicknames &quot;Rabbit&quot;, &quot;Little Everywhere&quot;, and &quot;Mighty Mite&quot; for his defensive prowess and was later considered an intelligent manager who understood the fundamentals of the game. Despite fielding successful teams for the Yankees in the 1920s, he continued to make personnel changes in order to maintain his teams' superiority in the AL. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1964.
Early life
Huggins was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, where his father, an Englishman, worked as a grocer.1 His mother was a native of Cincinnati and had two brothers and one sister.2

Huggins attended Woodward High School, Walnut Hills High School, and later the University of Cincinnati.34 At Cincinnati, Huggins studied law and played college baseball for the Cincinnati Bearcats baseball team. A shortstop, Huggins was named team captain of the Bearcats in 1900.5 Consumed with baseball, Huggins' law professors summoned him to inquire as to why they should keep him in the law program.6
Huggins' father, a devout Methodist, objected to his son playing baseball on Sundays.7 However, Huggins played semi-professional baseball in 1898 for the Cincinnati Shamrocks, a team organized by Julius Fleischmann,8 where he played under the pseudonym &quot;Proctor&quot; due to his father's opposition and his amateur status.910 In 1900, Huggins played for Fleischmann's semi-professional team based in the Catskill Mountains, the Mountain Tourists, leading the team with a .400 batting average.1112
Having graduated from Cincinnati with a law degree Huggins realized that he made more money playing baseball,13 and as such William Howard Taft, one of Huggins' law professors, advised him to play baseball.1415 Though he was admitted to the bar, Huggins never practiced law.16
Professional career
Early playing career (1899&lt;U+2013&gt;1903)
Huggins began his playing career in minor league baseball with the Mansfield Haymakers of the Class-B Interstate League in 1899. He continued his minor league apprenticeship with the St. Paul Saints of the American Association from 1901 through 1903.17 Beginning his career exclusively as a right-handed hitter, Huggins began to bat from the left side in 1902 in response to his offensive struggles in the 1901 season, while also shifting his position to second base during his time at St. Paul.18
 Huggins handled 19 fielding chances, 11 putouts and nine assists, without committing an error in a game with the Saints in 1902; the previous Major League Baseball (MLB) record being 18, set by Fred Dunlap in 1882.19 In 1903, Huggins executed the first delayed steal in recorded baseball history.20
Cincinnati Reds (1904&lt;U+2013&gt;1909)
Fleischmann, part-owner of the Cincinnati Reds of the National League (NL), kept an eye on Huggins while he played for St. Paul and the Reds duly purchased Huggins from the Saints before the 1904 season.21 He made his MLB debut on April 15, 1904,22 and proved very adept at getting on base. He batted .264 with the Reds that season, improving in the 1906 season, finishing with a .292 batting average and 41 stolen bases,23 as he spent considerable time working on his upper body strength.24
Though Huggins hoped to be selected as Ned Hanlon's successor as Cincinnati's manager after the 1907 season, the Reds instead went with John Ganzel.25 In 1908, Huggins played with the Reds in the Cuban-American Major League Clubs Series. Suffering from a broken ankle and torn ligaments in his shoulder, Huggins slumped to a .209 batting average during the 1909 season.26
St. Louis Cardinals (1910&lt;U+2013&gt;1917)
Before the 1910 season, the Reds traded Huggins, along with Frank Corridon and Rebel Oakes, to the St. Louis Cardinals in return for Fred Beebe and Alan Storke. Huggins set an MLB record on June 1, 1910 with six plate appearances but no at bats, as he drew four walks and hit two sacrifice flies.2728 In the same year Huggins batted .265 for the Cardinals, and led the NL in walks.29
 On July 13, 1911, Huggins tied the NL record for successful fielding chances with 16.30 He later finished sixth in the voting for the Chalmers Award in 1911, which was awarded to the Most Valuable Player. In the 1912 season, Huggins batted over .300 for the first time in his career.31
Huggins became player-manager for the Cardinals after the 1912 season, succeeding Roger Bresnahan,323334 with team owner Helene Hathaway Britton preferring Huggins' &quot;gentlemanly&quot; manner, as opposed to Bresnahan's rougher personality.35
With the acquisitions of speedy players in a trade with the Pittsburgh Pirates, including Dots Miller, Art Butler, Cozy Dolan, and Chief Wilson, the Cardinals contended for the NL pennant in 1914.36 Finishing in third place, it was the Cardinals' best finish since 1876,37 but the Cardinals fell back to sixth place in the 1915 season and last in 1916.38 When Britton sold the team after the 1916 season she offered Huggins a chance to buy a part of the team. While he was attempting to raise money from the Fleischmann family, Britton sold the team to a group headed by Samuel Breadon, who hired Branch Rickey to run the team's day-to-day operations in the front office.39
Huggins had coached the young Rogers Hornsby, helping him to correct his batting stance,40 and Hornsby duly succeeded Huggins as the team's starting second baseman in 1917, as Huggins ended his playing career.41 He managed the team during 1917, the last year of his contract, but was not retained.42
New York Yankees (1918&lt;U+2013&gt;1929)
With the New York Yankees of the American League (AL) not performing well, Yankees owners Jacob Ruppert and Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston sought to replace &quot;Wild&quot; Bill Donovan as manager.43 Ban Johnson, AL president, suggested Huggins to Ruppert as a replacement for Donovan. Huston, who had been in Europe at the time that Ruppert had made the appointment, disliked Huggins and wanted to hire Wilbert Robinson, his drinking buddy.44 Ruppert himself had been put off by Huggins' wool cap and practice of smoking pipes in public, which he felt was the mark of the working class.45 However, Ruppert interviewed Huggins upon Johnson's recommendation, and agreed that Huggins knew much about baseball.46 Ruppert offered the job to Huggins, who initially did not want to take the position, as the Yankees were in no better a position than the Cardinals. J. G. Taylor Spink of The Sporting News eventually convinced Huggins to accept the offer,47 and he signed a two-year contract.48 The hiring of Huggins drove a wedge between the two co-owners that culminated in Huston selling his shares of the team to Ruppert in 1922.4950

Having taken charge Huggins did not shy away from making personnel changes.515253 Upon taking over the Yankees, he stressed fundamental baseball, drilling the Yankees in the art of the bunt.54 Huggins also made his first player transaction, acquiring Del Pratt and Eddie Plank from the St. Louis Browns trading Nick Cullop, Joe Gedeon, Fritz Maisel, Les Nunamaker, Urban Shocker and $15,000 ($ in current dollar terms),55 a move that led to criticism in the press.56
In Huggins' first season with the Yankees, the team finished fourth in the AL.57 After that season, he obtained Ernie Shore, Dutch Leonard and Duffy Lewis from the Boston Red Sox, trading them for Ray Caldwell, Frank Gilhooley, Slim Love, and Roxy Walters.58 The following year he traded Pratt, Muddy Ruel, Hank Thormahlen and Sammy Vick to the Red Sox for Waite Hoyt, Harry Harper, Mike McNally and Wally Schang.59
Huston continually took the side of his players in any argument they had against Huggins,60 criticizing Huggins in the press when the Yankees lost the pennant in 1920.61 Meanwhile, Ruppert was at best a lukewarm advocate of Huggins.62 Babe Ruth resisted Huggins' discipline; he did not respect Huggins due to his small stature, soft-spoken nature, and inability to fight,63 and Huggins was unable to enforce punishments on Ruth.64 The Yankees finished third in the AL in 1919 and 1920.65
 Coming into the 1921 season, Huggins was still experiencing criticism in the press. Hugh Fullerton wrote that &quot;in the past Huggins has not shone as a leader of men&quot;.66 By that season, Huggins developed Aaron Ward, Wally Pipp, and Bob Shawkey.67 The Yankees won their first AL pennant in 1921,68 reaching the World Series for the first time in franchise history, silencing his critics in the press. However, they lost the 1921 World Series to the New York Giants. In response, Huggins sought to add more pitching talent.69
Before the 1922 season, Huggins acquired Johnny Mitchell from the Vernon Tigers of the Pacific Coast League and traded fan favorite Roger Peckinpaugh along with Rip Collins, Bill Piercy, and Jack Quinn to the Red Sox for Everett Scott, Bullet Joe Bush, and Sad Sam Jones.70 By this time, Ruppert hired Ed Barrow as the team's business manager, and he aided Huggins in player transactions.71 The Yankees repeated as AL champions that season,72 but lost the 1922 World Series, again to the Giants. With the newly gained confidence of his owners, Huggins was retained as manager.7374
The Yankees won their first World Series in 1923, preventing the Giants from repeating as champions for the third consecutive season.75 They were unable to retain their title the following season however, finishing second in the AL to the Washington Senators.76
Through 42 games of the 1925 season, the Yankees struggled, falling to seventh place in the eight-team AL,  games out of first place.77 Huggins made wholesale changes to the Yankees' lineup, as he replaced Ward at second base with Howard Shanks, catchers Steve O'Neill and Wally Schang with Benny Bengough, and, most notably, Pipp with Lou Gehrig at first base, beginning Gehrig's record consecutive games played streak. Among the team's regulars, only Babe Ruth, Joe Dugan, and Bob Meusel remained in the lineup.78 However, the team continued to struggle; amid rumors that he might replace Huggins, Ruppert stated that &quot;Miller Huggins will be manager as long as he cares to be&quot;.79 The Yankees fell to seventh place in the AL that season.80
With Ruppert's full support, Huggins' duties with the Yankees included keeping Ruth in line.8182 Unafraid of his star player, Huggins and Ruth often clashed.83 Huggins suspended Ruth indefinitely on August 29, 1925 for &quot;misconduct off the playing field&quot;, while also fining him $5,000 ($ in current dollar terms).8485 Ruth responded by claiming Ruppert would rescind the fine and suspension, and that he would never play for Huggins again, believing that Ruppert would side with him over Huggins. However, Ruppert insisted that the fine would stand and that Ruth would be suspended for as long as Huggins desired.86 After apologizing to Huggins and Ruppert,87 Huggins reinstated Ruth on September 5.88 Ruth did not challenge Huggins' authority again.89

Huggins restructured the team for the 1926 season, giving starting jobs to Mark Koenig and Tony Lazzeri.90 That season, Huggins won his fourth pennant with the Yankees in 1926,91 marking the first time that a team won a pennant after finishing seventh the year prior.9293 However, the Yankees lost the 1926 World Series to the Cardinals in seven games.
Winning the pennant once again in the 1927 season, Huggins matched Cap Anson's mark of five pennants in seven seasons.94 That year, the Yankees benefited from the development of George Pipgras and Wilcy Moore,95 and set an MLB record with 110 regular season victories,96 winning the AL by 19 games.97 The Yankees swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1927 World Series. This team became known as Murderers' Row, and is considered the one of the greatest teams in baseball history.98
Huggins remained confident in his team's ability to repeat as AL champions in 1928 season.99100 Huggins supplemented his team by acquiring Bill Dickey from the minor leagues.101 He acquired Stan Coveleski, who was attempting to return to his peak years, but released him in August when the former star continued to struggle.102 The Yankees reached the 1928 World Series, winning their sixth pennant in eight years,103 and defeated the Cardinals 4 games to 0. This was the first time a team swept their opponents in consecutive World Series'.104
Huggins continued to tinker with his roster during the offseason. He traded Dugan, Mike Gazella, Rosy Ryan and Pat Collins,105 and acquired Lyn Lary from the Pacific Coast League.106 He tried Lary at third base and Leo Durocher at shortstop,107 while he attempted to acquire George Uhle and Ed Morris, but was unsuccessful in both cases.108 The Yankees fell behind the Philadelphia Athletics in the standings during the 1929 season and as it became clear that the Yankees would not win the AL pennant in 1929, Huggins began consulting with coaches Art Fletcher and Bob Shawkey about the future of the team, including how to replace Bob Meusel in left field.109 However, by August 1929 Huggins began losing weight and complained of feeling ill.110
Death
 Huggins fell ill on September 20, 1929, checking in to Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center for erysipelas. Matters worsened due to him contracting influenza, which resulted in a high fever.111112 The Yankees' club physician, in consultation with other doctors, decided to perform blood transfusions.113114
Huggins died at the age of 50 on September 25, 1929 of pyaemia.115 The league canceled its games for the following day out of respect,116 and the viewing of his casket at Yankee Stadium drew thousands of tearful fans. A moment of silence was held for Huggins prior to the start of Game 4 of the 1929 World Series.117 He was interred at Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati.118
The Yankees found it difficult to replace Huggins. Fletcher managed the team for its final eleven games of the 1929 season, but he did not want to manage the team full-time. After the season, Ruppert offered the job to Fletcher, Donie Bush, and Eddie Collins, all of whom declined. Eventually, Shawkey agreed to serve as the Yankees manager for the 1930 season.119120
Playing and managing profile
Huggins was listed at  and .121 His small stature inspired the nicknames &quot;Mighty Mite&quot; and the &quot;Mite Manager&quot;.122 He was also known as &quot;Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Little Everywhere&quot; for his ability to cover ground defensively.123 An excellent lead-off batter and defensive second baseman, he ended his playing career with a .265 batting average and .956 fielding percentage.124 He led the league in walks four times and regularly posted an on base percentage near .400. He scored 100 or more runs three times and regularly stole 30 or more bases. He finished his career with 324 steals.
Huggins finished his managerial career with a 1413&lt;U+2013&gt;1134 record. His 1413 wins as a manager ranks 23rd all-time.125 He learned his managerial strategy by observing Hanlon and Bresnahan. His style of managing included the use of speed through base stealing, hit and runs, and slap hitting. The acquisition of the power hitting Ruth meant a change towards emphasizing power and not giving away outs.126 With the Yankees, he recruited batters with the ability to hit for power and pitchers who were consistent, rather than brilliant.127
Legacy
In 1915, umpire and sportswriter Billy Evans, writing about the scarcity of competent second basemen in baseball, listed Huggins, Collins, Pratt, Johnny Evers, and Nap Lajoie as the best in the game.128 He later wrote that Huggins was &quot;one of the greatest managers I have ever met&quot;.129 Bill James ranked Huggins as the 37th best second baseman of all time in 2001 in his The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.130
The Yankees dedicated a monument to Huggins on May 30, 1932, placing it in front of the flagpole in center field at Yankee Stadium. Huggins was the first of many Yankees legends granted this honor, which eventually became &quot;Monument Park&quot;, dedicated in 1976. The monument calls Huggins &quot;A splendid character who made priceless contributions to baseball.&quot;131 The Yankees also named a field at Al Lang Stadium, their spring training home, after Huggins.132133
Huggins was included on the ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937, 1938, 1939, 1942, 1945, 1946, 1948, and 1950, failing to receive the number of votes required for election on those occasions. The Veterans Committee elected Huggins to the Hall of Fame in February 1964,134 and he was posthumously inducted that summer.135
Personal
Huggins was a private man who kept to himself. He lived in Cincinnati during the winters while playing for the Reds and Cardinals,136 but began to make St. Petersburg, Florida his winter home while managing the Yankees.137 Huggins did not marry,138 and lived with his sister while in Cincinnati.139
Huggins invested in real estate holdings in Florida,140 although he sold them in 1926 as they took too much of his time away from baseball.141 He enjoyed playing golf and billiards in his spare time.142143
