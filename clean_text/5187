Desmond Wilkinson Llewelyn (September 12, 19131 or 191423 — December 19, 1999) was a Welsh actor, famous for playing the fictional character of Q in the James Bond series of films.
Biography
Early life
Llewelyn was born in Newport, Wales, the son of Mia and Ivor Llewelyn,4 a coal mining engineer. He originally wanted to be a minister but during his education at Radley College he worked as a stagehand in the school's productions and then picked up sporadic small parts.
The outbreak of World War II in September 1939 halted his acting career, and Llewelyn was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British army, serving with the Royal Welch Fusiliers. In 1940, he was captured by the German army in France, and was held as a POW for five years. During this period he appeared in a number of theatrical productions as well as taking part in attempted escape activities.
Career
Since 1963's From Russia with Love, Llewelyn appeared as Q (the quartermaster of the MI6 gadget lab known as Q-branch) in every James Bond film, except Dr No (1962) and Live and Let Die (1973), until The World Is Not Enough (1999). He had originally been chosen for the role as he had previously worked with the director Terence Young on the 1950 war film They Were Not Divided. In the 2002 film Die Another Day, John Cleese, who played the character R, the assistant to Q in The World Is Not Enough, was promoted to the head of Q-branch, thus taking on the title of Q. In all, Llewelyn appeared in 17 Bond films, more than any other actor, and worked with the first five James Bond actors. He also portrayed Q in a 1967 made-for-television special (produced by EON Productions) entitled, Welcome to Japan, Mr. Bond which was included in the 2006 special edition DVD release of You Only Live Twice.
Llewelyn appeared in other films such as the 1981 PBS production of Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde and also a small appearance in the famous musical Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) and in the Ealing comedy The Lavender Hill Mob (1951). He acted on stage and appeared in the British television series Follyfoot - his commitments filming that series was one of the reasons why he did not appear in Live and Let Die.
Llewelyn's final Bond film, The World Is Not Enough, had been released only a few weeks before his death, and in his final scene in the picture he is shown being lowered into the ground beside a BMW Z8 at the Scotland headquarters while saying the line, &quot;Always have an escape plan&quot;. Although the film had alluded to Q's retirement, which Bond hoped wouldn't be anytime soon, and introduced John Cleese's character as heir presumptive, Llewelyn had stated not long before his death that he had no plans to retire and that he would continue playing Q &quot;as long as the producers want me and the Almighty doesn't.&quot;5. Even though Llewelyn retired from the role in 1999, he was planning to make a cameo apperance in the next Bond movie Die Another Day.
Personal life &amp; death
Although one of British cinema's most recognisable characters and an important and long-standing element in the 'Bond' franchise, 'Q' did not make Desmond Llewelyn rich: the actor was merely paid 'by the day' for his few hours of work on-set, and did not share in the money made by the films. Contrary to his gadget-expert character in the Bond films, Llewelyn always maintained that he was totally lost in the world of technology, a trait that also plagued his successor, John Cleese.
Llewelyn was killed in a road accident on December 19, 1999 after returning home from a friend's house. His Renault Megane car without other occupants collided head-on with a 35-year-old man driving a bronze Fiat Bravo company car on the A27 road near the village of Berwick, East Sussex. He died shortly afterwards. He was 85. The other driver was seriously injured.6 Roger Moore, who had appeared with Llewelyn in six Bond movies, spoke at his funeral.
In an interview published well after his death, Llewelyn stated that of all the actors to have portrayed James Bond, he felt that Timothy Dalton's performance was the closest to the way Bond was portrayed in the original novels..
