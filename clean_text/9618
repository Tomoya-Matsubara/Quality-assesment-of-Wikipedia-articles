Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a del Luj&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Telpuk, (sometimes Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a de Luj&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Telpuk) or the Suitcase Girl is a former airport policewoman at Aeroparque Jorge Newbery in Buenos Aires, Argentina who noticed a suitcase with US$800,000 as it went through an X-ray machine in August 2007.12 In December 2007, the money became a very public part of an international election suitcase scandal, known as Maletinazo. When the suitcase scandal became public, she became an international celebrity and appeared on covers several magazines, including those of the February 2008 issue of the Argentine edition of Playboy magazine and the March 2008 issue of the Venezuelan edition of Playboy magazine.3
Personal
Telpuk is a former nursery school teacher who stands at .4 She was raised in a small town in the Santa Fe Province where she taught nursery school, but she moved to Buenos Aires after passing an entrance exam for the Airport Security Police about three years prior to the Maletinazo incident.5 In the short time since Telpuk has transformed from night shift police woman to pinup girl almost overnight, she has left the police force, joined a charter airline, begun taking English classes and begun to prepare for a role on Skating for a Dream, an Argentine variety show.6
Telpuk's mother is named Yolanda and lives in a middle-class suburb of Buenos Aires.7 She is widowed and used to work for a pasta factory.8
Maletinazo
On August 4 2007 at 2:45 a.m.,9 she discovered the money that became part of a political scandal in the electoral campaign of President of Argentina Cristina Fern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez de Kirchner and that was possessed by a  associate of President of Venezuela Hugo Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez.1011 The carrier, Guido Antonini Wilson (who is referred to in the press by both Antonini and Wilson and who is sometimes referred to by the nicknames &quot;El Gordo&quot; or &quot;The Fat Man&quot;),12 is an interpreter and was part of a delegation of executives that traveled to Argentina in advance of Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez' energy deal signing.13 He opened the bag at the insistence of Telpuk, who noticed the six dense and perfectly rectangular blocks in the luggage scans.14 At first, Wilson had explained the items as books and papers at first.1516 When forced to open it, he began to stammer and show signs of nervousness,17 and he said the suitcase only contained about $60,000.18 The blocks turned out to be US$790,550.19 The delegation, which arrived on a Cessna Citation jet arriving from Caracas, Venezuela chartered by Energ&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Argentina, SA, carried five Venezuelans and three Argentines who represented their respective governments' energy companies.20 In a country known for its corruption, Telpuk did not have an interest in a bribe although she felt Wilson may have expected her to be willing to take one. Instead of pursuing a bribe, she reported the finding.21
Although the local media of both Argentina and Venezuela gave the story immediate front page coverage, the case faded away until after Kirchner was elected.2223 The United States prosecutors believe that the money represented a contribution from Venezuelan President Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez to the presidential campaign of Argentina's leftist leader, Kirchner.24 Two days after the December 10 2007 inauguration, several arrests were announced by prosecutors working for the United States Attorney General. The arrests were for activities related to having offered Wilson $2 million to keep quiet about the contributions from Venezuela to support Kirchner's campaign.2526
For her part, Telpuk felt she was caught in the &quot;middle of a rivalry of nations&quot;.27 She has been vilified as a mercenary fortune-seeker and CIA lackey.28 She has received a variety of threats by telephone and email, and had police protection starting when the incident became a public scandal in December.29 She has even received a bouquet with an ominous note.30
Media appearances
Her first magazine cover appearance was on the December issue of an irreverent political magazine, Veintitr&lt;U+00E9&gt;s where Telpuk appeared under the headline &quot;The Bombshell Behind the Suitcase&quot; standing behind a suitcase. She wore little other than a police cap, and another headline on the cover read, &quot;Is She the Key Piece of a Plot Designed by Washington?&quot;31 She then appeared on the February issue of the Argentine edition of Playboy magazine next to the headline &quot;Corrupci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Al Desnudo&quot; (translated as &quot;Corruption Laid Bare&quot;).32 Subsequently, she appeared on the March 2008 issue of the Venezuelan edition of Playboy magazine. She posed with a red suitcase decorated with both the Argentine and Venezuelan flags while wearing a scarf, black leather gloves and black-and-white boots for her Playboy cover appearance. Within the magazine in her pictorial, she posed with fewer clothes and with various props: ubiquitous suitcase, dollar bills, including the propeller blades of a single-engine airplane.33 She decided to pursue an appearance on the Argentine variety show Skating for a Dream, after Marcelo Tinelli visited her at the airport to congratulate her.34 She may become a television show host.35
