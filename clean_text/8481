Victor Newman (born Christian Miller) is a fictional character from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless, portrayed by German-American actor Eric Braeden since 1980. Initially a guest character who was to last from eight to twelve weeks, Victor has evolved into the show's leading male figure. Created by the late William J. Bell as a &quot;despicable, contemptible, unfaithful wife abuser&quot;, the character was planned to be killed off and never heard of again.1 However, after Bell saw Braeden's performance, he decided to sign the actor onto a contract. Braeden was hesitant to work on a soap opera, but eventually signed a contract, and has remained on the series as a regular cast member for a total of thirty-two years. The character is widely described as &quot;ruthless&quot; and while loving to those he holds dear, is considered a villain.23 Over the years, he has also been the center of several controversial plots and relationships.4
Victor arrived in Genoa City, Wisconsin for business. He eventually formed his own worldwide conglomerate, Newman Enterprises. His first marriage to Julia Newman (Meg Bennet) failed; following this, he formed a romance with stripper Nikki Reed (Melody Thomas Scott). This would be the start of their three decade-long relationship, which includes a pattern of marriages, divorces, reunions and so on. He shares two children with Nikki,  Victoria (Amelia Heinle) and Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). During his first marriage to her, he cheated with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). He has also had a long-standing romantic history with Ashley, and they share a child together, Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan). He was briefly married to a woman named Hope Wilson (Signy Coleman) and they had a son together, Victor &quot;Adam&quot; Newman, Jr., who grew up without knowledge of Victor being his father. Victor has had several other romantic relationships, including one with his former daughter-in-law Sharon Collins (Sharon Case), which was poorly received and criticized by the actors and public.
Braeden's portrayal of Victor in the past three decades has garnered him several accolades. This includes having his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame which was presented to him in July 2007.5 He has been nominated at the Daytime Emmy Awards eight times for  Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, having taken home the award in 1998.6 He has been pre-nominated three times in this category. Additionally, he was the recipient of the &quot;Favorite Male Performer In A Daytime Serial&quot; award at the 18th Annual People's Choice Awards in 1992.7 On October 8, 2009, it was announced that Braeden was to exit The Young and the Restless.89 Head writer and executive producer at the time Maria Arena Bell wrote both Braeden and Scott out of the show's scripts.10 Budgetary cuts were credited with their departures that November.11 After his exit, Braeden publicly made it clear he was unhappy and felt betrayed by the show. He said that he had signed a three-year contract and was obligated to fulfill that; however, the show had told him they changed their minds. In response, Braeden stated: &quot;Where in the world of business does this kind of contract exist?&quot;12 Braeden also insisted that it wasn't about money, but about the shock of being fired.13 Despite his anger, he managed to reach a contract negotiation with the series and returned in January the following year.14 His next contract expired in 2012, after which he re-signed with the show following a brief leave of absence.15 During this period of time, the character's company was taken over and he was thought to be dead.
Casting and creation
In 1997, William J. Bell, who created Victor, said that the character was originally a short-term non-contract role.161718 Bell noted: &quot;[Victor] would last between eight to twelve weeks, at which time he was to be shot by his beautiful wife. In short, Victor Newman was in concept a despicable, contemptible, unfaithful wife abuser.&quot; Bell said that when he saw Braeden's first performance, &quot;the voice, the power, the inner strength&lt;U+2014&gt;I knew immediately I didn't want to lose this man. He was exactly what the show needed. Not the hateful man we saw onscreen, but the man he could and would become over time. The first thing was to get Eric under contract, but he didn't want to go under contract.&quot; According to Bell, Braeden was uneasy about television and initially didn't want a full-time job on a soap opera. Bell said &quot;Eric became more comfortable with the medium, and more trusting with the producers, and agreed to sign a contract. If memory serves, it was for six months. I immediately changed my story in the hope of salvaging this character. The rest is history.&quot;19
Development
Characterization
The soap's official website notes: &quot;Victor is loving and protective toward family and loved ones, but if crossed, or if Victor feels that one is not living up to one's full potential; then he can more than live up to the adjective that many have used to describe him ruthless&quot;.20 Others, however, label him as evil and a villain. Although he is often considered malicious, Eric Braeden has said: &quot;Bill Bell was a very wise man. He created someone in Victor who is a very lonely man yet also a man who can be affectionate and loving and forgiving.&quot;21 Shelly Fralic of Winnipeg Free Press wrote:22  Fralic further described him as being a &quot;quixotic&quot; character, who is &quot;deeply layered with arrogance and angst, imbued with all the failings and bravado that a true villain possesses, his dastardly deeds leaving him most recently responsible not only for the death of his own heart donor, but for the near-death of his granddaughter Summer from peanut poisoning&quot;.23 She also noted that he's been jailed, thrown in a psychiatric ward and shot, had amnesia, epilepsy among other events, but: &quot;like all villains worth their salt, he's survived it all and inspired respect, if not adoration.&quot;24 Braeden has stated: &quot;He's the villain! He's defensive and always self-protective. He's not here to win a popularity contest.&quot;25 The actor, comparing himself to the character, noted that he is nothing like Victor, stating: &quot;Money makes a lot of things happen for Victor. My God almighty, that's something else that I, Eric Braeden, would never do. I always confront things directly. But when that doesn't work for Victor, he gets out his wallet  If you are abusive to him, he will be abusive to you. No one gets away with that. I will not allow anyone to cross that line with the character.&quot;26 
Misogyny controversy
Soap creator William J. Bell said that when Victor debuted, he was to be &quot;in concept a despicable, contemptible, unfaithful wife abuser&quot;.27 During an interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide in June 2011, Braeden responded to Victor violently shoving his wife Diane Jenkins (Maura West) out the back of an ambulance, leaving her bruised and bloody in the middle of nowhere.28 Logan wrote: &quot;he's pushing it with the fans. The megalomaniacal patriarch earned considerable viewer backlash last month when he threw his ex-wife [Diane] from the back of an ambulance and left her bruised and bloodied on the road  Sure, Di's a lying, conniving skank who was trying to destroy Victor's life, but still!&quot; On the issue of controversial viewer backlash, Braeden responded: &quot;To be quite truthful with you, I had no idea that was happening. I didn't think much about the scene when we shot it or any impact it might have. My only concern was for the stunt woman and that she would fall properly and not be hurt.&quot;29 On whether Victor crossed the line, he said: &quot;I completely understand how viewers would be upset by [the ambulance scene] and under no circumstances would I personally condone any kind of physical violence against women  But Victor just doesn't give a s--t. And he doesn't take any s--t. That is the whole point of the character.&quot;30 Braeden, however, also said that he didn't like women defeating Victor, and wasn't pleased in a scene years ago where his daughter Victoria (Heather Tom) slapped him.31
Relationships

For over thirty years, he has been romantically linked with Nikki Reed (Melody Thomas Scott). Nikki was originally from the lower walks of life, having been a prostitute and stripper. After multiple failed relationships, she began a romance with Victor, who taught her about society.32 They fell in love and had a baby, Victoria Newman (Heather Tom), and later a son Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow).33 The couple are widely considered a supercouple within the realm of soap operas. The writers of The Young and the Restless detailed characters Victor Newman and Nikki Reed to marry and divorce or depart from each other in some form or fashion in a continuous cycle. This has taken place for as long as the couple has been together, a take on the original supercouple formula.34 Soap Opera Digest relayed the beginning of the pairing's creation and their impact. The &quot;inspired decision&quot; led to Victor and Nikki becoming the series' most successful supercouple.35 In an interview with Dose magazine, Melody Thomas Scott said that the couple always has to get back together, but not without a challenge.36
They are recognized as one of daytime's most prominent couples.373839 The couple has received positive reviews from critics throughout the years,40 The News &amp; Advance cited Victor and Nikki with other romances considered &quot;epic&quot; of the early supercouple era.41 They have also garnered a large fan following,4243 they are commonly referred to as &quot;Niktor&quot; on internet message boards.4445 In addition, the couple's weddings have been reported by mainstream media.4647 Scott has said, &quot;Let&lt;U+2019&gt;s face facts: Victor and Nikki will always be a huge dynamic, they&lt;U+2019&gt;ve been in a circular cycle for over 30 years! Finding a new leading man that you have chemistry with is like finding gold.&quot;48 Eric Braeden has said, &quot;I love working with Melody [as well]. I always thought it was an honestly felt love story with great material for conflict with Nikki.&quot;49 Former As the World Turns actress Martha Byrne has said, &quot;Young and Restless' Victor and Nikki are the perfect example of a couple who they can tear apart and put back together how many times? And [the writers] do it really well because they're so stable as characters that you can basically do anything with them now, and the audience will go on the journey with them.&quot;50 Daytime expert Michael Fairman stated: &quot;Victor and Nikki just can&lt;U+2019&gt;t, we mean can&lt;U+2019&gt;t, ever get it together long enough to find any happiness with each other. So, many would say that they deserve each other and the baggage and betrayals that come along with their co-dependent relationship.&quot;51
Aside from Nikki, Victor is known for his relationship with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). While Ashley was at a low point in her life, he had an affair with her.52 This led to her pregnancy, which he left Nikki for. However, Nikki was diagnosed with cancer and he returned to her, and Ashley aborted her baby; a move she regretted for many years. Ashley stole his sperm many years later, and had a child Abby Carlton.53 Abby was believed to be Brad Carlton's (Don Diamont) daughter until she was five years old. He was married to Ashley from 1990 to 1992. In 2008 after he left following the death of his wife, Sabrina, Ashley tracked him down when nobody else could. They reconnected their romantic relationship and eventually were a couple again, after 18 years. They married and Ashley became pregnant; but miscarried.545556
Victor was also noted for his controversial relationship with both of his son's ex wife, Sharon Collins (Sharon Case). They initially had a father-daughter relationship.5758 In 2003, Victor and Sharon shared a kiss.59 This sparked a huge rift in her marriage to Nick; she left town to &quot;find herself&quot;. Victor supported Sharon throughout her legal problems, and paid her bail at first when she was convicted un-rightfully of murder.60 Case has stated: &quot;[Sharon] thinks of Victor, in a way like a father figure, but not quite. When she was younger she saw him as that, and then when she grew up she saw him less as a father and more like a hero&quot;.61 Case said that Victor is Sharon's security blanket.62 The dynamic of the relationship changed when Victor proposed a non-romantic marriage to Sharon on December 31, 2011. At first, she declined but considered it for her long term well-being and that of Faith.63 At the time, Victor was in jail for the murder of Diane Jenkins, to protect Nikki. Nikki walked in on their jailhouse wedding ceremony, as they were pronounced man and wife.64 They annulled days later. However, months later, they began a real relationship. Joshua Morrow (Nick) told Soaps In Depth: &quot;I was always kind of surprised that Nick just accepted this from his dad. There were never any scenes showing legitimate anger, like, 'What are you doing?! I had several scenes with Sharon where Nick voices his displeasure.&quot;65 Braeden didn't agree with the pairing either, stating: &quot;We all have gone through periods of playing something we didn't really like to play so much, but you do it. Sharon is a wonderful actress&quot;.66
Soap opera journalist Michael Fairman said that the relationship &quot;hasn&lt;U+2019&gt;t worked out or caught fire through the writing, or with the fans watching on-screen!&quot;67 In August 2012, Victor and Sharon married a second time, but he disappeared shortly after. Sharon thought he was abandoning her.68 Sharon later burned their prenuptial agreement, and took over this company. Talking about the situation, Case stated that the writers could have done this storyline &quot;a million other ways&quot; without &quot;marrying him [Victor].&quot;69 In another interview, she spoke thoroughly of the relationship, saying: &quot;Sometimes controversial storylines can work because you're bringing attention to a controversial issue that the nation is trying to decide on. But this was not one of those things. Everybody is universally against incest! It was just so upsetting to the audience. Whenever the actors went to do [personal appearances], the fans would bring it up. Literally, every actor in the building was coming up to me, giving me feedback that they were getting about it!&quot;70 When asked if the marriage was about &quot;daddy issues&quot;, Case said: &quot;That's usually the case in a story like that, but I don't think it's one most people want to watch!&quot;71 Victor eventually returned home and annulled her. During an interview with The Province, Michael Muhney (Adam) said: &quot;The Victor and Sharon marriage was almost like an inside joke.&quot;72
Departure and return
In 2009, Braeden experienced multiple contract negotiation issues,7374 leading to then executive producer Maria Arena Bell writing both Victor and Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) off the canvas.75 Their departures were reportedly due to sudden salary cuts in the middle of already negotiated contracts.7677 During his onscreen absence, contract negotiations ensued with unknown predictions from the soap.78 On the situation of the soap cutting his contract, Braeden stated during an interview: &quot;When I sign a three-year deal, I'm obligated to fulfill that deal. The producers, however, can come to me after a half-year and say, 'We've changed our minds.' Where in the world of business does this kind of contract exist? Do I blame the people for wanting to squeeze as much out of us as they can? I do not. The question is, when do you squeeze too much?&quot;79
In another interview with Soap Opera Digest, the actor said: &quot;It's not that one hadn't agreed to a reduction, but they hit you with a sledgehammer. It's done in such an insulting fashion. It could have been dealt with in a far more gracious way. It is cold and hard-nosed... The whole thing was so calculated it was unbelievable... It's not even about the money.&quot;80 Despite this, during the contract negotiations, Braeden refused to say that he had departed fully, but did not know when a return would occur.81 However, within weeks, news broke that the actor and the soap had managed a new contract.82 In a statement issued by CBS Daytime, they said: &quot;We're very happy that Eric will be remaining with The Young and the Restless. Victor Newman has been an important part of the Genoa City canvas for nearly 30 years, and we know our audience will be tuning in to see what his plans are next.&quot;83 Onscreen, Braeden exited November 2, 2009,84 and returned by January 15, 2010.85 That same year, the actor celebrated 30 years on the soap.86 In 2012, Braeden experienced further contract negotiations and speculation arose again that he would be leaving the soap.87 Due to this, reports said that Victor would be absent from the canvas for two weeks and that his contract expired that November.88 Two months later, it was announced that the actor had signed a new contract with The Young and the Restless,89 furthering his portrayal of Victor for the foreseeable future. &quot;Very glad we got the negotiations successfully behind us,&quot; the actor said at the time.90

Victor Newman was born Christian Miller on March 7 , in Buffalo, New York. He was put in an orphanage by his mother, Cora Miller (Dorothy McGuire), when he was seven years old. By the time he was a teenager, he left the orphanage and started to work his way through to victory, becoming one of the world's wealthiest tycoons. He changed his name to &quot;Victor Newman,&quot; Victor standing for &quot;victorious&quot; and Newman standing for &quot;new man,&quot; as he was a completely new man.91 In 1977, Victor married Julia Newman (Meg Bennet) as he began to develop a strong business reputation.
1980&lt;U+2014&gt;
Victor relocates to Genoa City with his wife Julia to help Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) run Chancellor Industries. He keeps Julia in seclusion at a newly-bought ranch house, causing her to have an affair with photographer Michael. Victor soared in his business life, creating Newman Enterprises; he too cheated on Julia with women including Eve Howard (Margaret Mason) and Lorie Brooks (Jaime Lyn Bauer). Victor learned of Julia's affair and that she was pregnant. He attacks Michael, and Julia gets involved, losing her child. It was later revealed Victor was in fact the biological father. Julia and Michael leave town. Eve has a baby, Cole Howard (J. Eddie Peck), who was believed to be Victor's son. Victor turns his attention to stripper and former prostitute Nikki Reed (Melody Thomas Scott). He took over the Prentiss family's company, Prentiss Industries. They schemed to get it back by Lorie, the former sister-in-law of Lucas Prentiss, seducing Victor into marriage. He eventually signed it back himself. He was in love with Lorie, but she dumped him and he turned his attention back to Nikki. Nikki becomes pregnant with Victor's child while married to Kevin Bancroft. She romanced con man Rick Daros; he nearly killed her but Paul Williams (Doug Davidson), Andy Richards (Steven Ford) and Victor saved her. Nikki gives birth to Victoria Newman. Even returned with her new boyfriend Max Siebalt and schemed to get Victor's money allocated to Cole in his will. Eve got a job as Victor's assistant and Julia returned to town to protect Victor. Nonetheless, he planned to marry Eve but &quot;dies&quot; on the day of the wedding. Victor was actually well and alive. His able to be with Nikki and they marry on April 13, 1984, right before Eve attempted to stab Nikki before the ceremony.92 A year later, Eve and Rick Daros, the man who tried repeatedly to kill Nikki, return again, while Victor and Nikki are vacationing. Rick, however, had amnesia, and forget he had tried to kill Nikki. Nonetheless, they were able to steal some money from Victor and later escape to Europe together.
Victor reunited with his mother, Cora Miller, before her death. Although in love with Nikki, he began falling for Jack Abbott's (Peter Bergman) sister, Ashley Abbott, who was saddened over learning John Abbott (Jerry Douglas) was not her biological father. They had an affair. Nikki is enraged and has an affair with Jack to spite Victor. Ashley ended up pregnant and Victor left Nikki; but when Nikki was diagnosed with cancer, he left Ashley and returned to her. Ashley aborted her baby. Eventually, Nikki went into remission, allowing Victor to return to Ashley, but by now she had moved on with her psychiatrist, Steven Lassiter. Luckily, for Victor, Steven was later shot by one of his patients. Victor and Jack hire Leanna &quot;Love&quot; Randolph (Barbara Crampton) to write a biography on Victor himself. Jack intends to have his version of the book be a tell-all entitled Ruthless: The Victor Newman Story. Unknowingly to Jack, Leanna adds a chapter that exploits the affair between Victor and Ashley and Ashley's abortion. By this time, Victor and Nikki's marriage was falling apart despite the last minute attempt to salvage their marriage with the birth of Nicholas Newman around New Year's Eve 1988, and he believed she was behind the publication. Victor divorces her and to prove to the press he didn't divorce Nikki to be with Ashley, he marries Leanna, but it was declared invalid since his divorce from Nikki wasn't final. Despite that, Victor stays with Leanna until the revelation. Victor also proceeds to avenge his degradation by gaining reigns over Jack&lt;U+2019&gt;s family company, Jabot Cosmetics, which Jack had recently convinced his father to make a public company. With Victor now in control, he fired Jack and replaced him with Brad Carlton. In response, Jack spitefully marries Nikki after Victor and Nikki had another falling out.
Victor married Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson) and Leanna achieved fame with a daytime talk show. Victor told Jack that he would give him back Jabot if he divorced Nikki. Jack agreed but unfortunately, didn't have full control over the company because of a legal loophole. During confrontation, Victor had a heart attack. Jack left him there to die but Victor survived. Jack and Nikki's marriage eventually strained because of Nikki's alcoholism and pain killer addiction, which Victor supported her through. Victor's marriage with Ashley eventually ended as he reconnected with Nikki, and because of his daughter, Victoria's great opposition. Shortly thereafter though, Victor briefly romanced Ashley's former step-mother, Jill Foster Abbott (Jess Walton), but he ended it to be with Nikki.
Eve Howard returned to Genoa City and wanted Victor to have a relationship with his &quot;son&quot; Cole Howard. Cole romanced Victoria, not knowing about Victor being his &quot;father&quot;. Around this time, Victor left town and traveled to Kansas, while he was presumed dead back in Genoa City. He met a blind woman Hope Adams (Signy Coleman). They married and had a son, Victor Adam Newman, Jr.. While he was way, Cole and Victoria had married, and Victor revealed that they were brother and sister, and the marriage was annulled. However, when Eve died it was revealed that Cole was not Victor's son and they remarried. He divorced Hope when she returned to her home, and Victor, Jr. was raised not knowing Victor was his father. Nikki, by this time began romancing Brad, much to Victor's dismay. On the night of their wedding Victor was shot and Nikki returned to him. Many were suspected to have shot him, but the mentally unstably Mary Jo Manson (Diana Barton) was guilty of the crime. Victor and Nikki had briefly reunited before Victor returned to see Hope after her new husband, Cliff Wilson, had suddenly died.
Fueling his feud with Jack, Victor marries the former girlfriend of his rival, Diane Jenkins (Alex Donnelley) in 1997, but Nikki persuaded Victor to have a vasectomy. Yet, Victor had stored some sperm in a lab for a future possibility. Nikki had moved on and married her doctor, Joshua Landers (Heath Kizzier). When Nikki is shot and nearly killed by Joshua's ex-wife Veronica Landers (Candice Daly), Victor divorces Diane to marry Nikki at her deathbed, promising Diane he would re-marry her after Nikki's death. However, Nikki survived and eventually reunited with Victor. Diane and Victor had a bitter divorce that continued through 2000. By then, Nikki reunited with Brad Carlton, as he and Jack had take control of Newman Enterprises.
Diane remained in love with Victor, and stole his sperm to get herself pregnant with his child. Nikki and Ashley stole sperm too. After a mix up, Diane had a son Kyle Jenkins Abbott (Garrett Ryan) by Jack, while Ashley had Abby Carlton (Darcy Rose Byrnes), Victor's biological daughter. Abby's paternity isn't known, and she is brought up to believe she is Brad's daughter until she was five. Victor's former fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Lorie returned when her husband Max Hollister (Sam Behrens) threatened to take over Julia's design firm. Julia helped Julia; as a form of revenge, Max appeared on Leanna Love's talk show and accused Victor of seeing his former wives. Nonetheless Victor and Nikki were together. Despite Max using Lorie to scheme to end Victor's happiness with Nikki, the set-up didn't work and he remarried Nikki. After rescuing Nikki from a carjacker, Victor was diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy with head trauma. During this, Jack took advantage of him and they formed a friendship; Victor figures this out. Caught up in business by taking Jabot away from Jack and deals with N.V.P. Retreats weakened his marriage to Nikki. They divorced, and she began doing business of her own, running for state senate against Jack and romancing David Chow (Vincent Irizarry). Nikki lost, and married a manipulative David, posing under an identity. Victor travels to Kansas when Hope dies, and reunited with his son Adam Newman (Michael Muhney); who finally is told the truth about his paternity. Adam comes to Genoa City and works at Newman.
Victor then has a romance and marries Victoria's best friend, Sabrina Costelana (Raya Meddine). She became pregnant. During an art gala, both Sabrina and David were killed. Victor left town and closed up. He nearly dies in Mexico. Many try to find him, but only Ashley is successful. She finds him in Paris, France and brings him home. They re-connect romantically and return as a couple. Victor is accused of murdering a man named Walter who was responsible for Sabrina's death. Adam and Jack forged a fake diary to make him look guilty. He was cleared and Ashley became pregnant, and they married. She suffered a miscarriage after Adam gas-lighted her and had an hysterical pregnancy. To cover up, Adam stole Sharon and Nick's newborn baby Faith and gave her to Ashley, who thought it was her own. During this, Victor was shot by Patty Williams (Stacy Haiduk); an unstable woman he brought to town under the alias of Mary Jane Benson who was obsessed with Jack. Victor, now split from Ashley, left for treatment in Europe with Nikki. Upon Victor's return, it was revealed that Adam had stolen Faith and given her to Ashley. Adam later faked his death, but was apprehended in Brazil. During this time, he went to Canada in search of his son and met Meggie McClaine (Sean Young). He returned to Genoa City and brought Meggie to town for her safety. She became Nikki's personal assistant; but caused Nikki to relapse into alcoholism. It was revealed that Meggie was sabotaging her to marry Victor, as she has a history of marrying men and then killing them for their money. He married and then had her arrested, while Nikki moved on with Deacon Sharpe (Sean Kanan). Later, Nick, Victoria and Abby filed a lawsuit against Victor for mistreatment, which they won.
Diane Jenkins (Maura West) returned and reconnected with Victor. They eloped, but the brief marriage ended as a result of infidelity in both of their parts. Diane was murdered in self defense by Nikki. Nikki married Deacon, but they divorced. During this time, he married Sharon so she could protect his assets while he was in prison; having falsely confessed to the murder to protect Nikki. Due to Newman's changing finances, Beauty of Nature was briefly bought by Genevieve Atkinson (Genie Francis), who at the time was engaged to Jack, through her holding company FMN. After he had sex with her, she sold it back. Victor and Sharon later developed an actual romance, and married a second time; this was to spite Nikki's marriage to Jack. He disappeared shortly after; and had been living in Los Angeles with amnesia. While he was away, Sharon believed that he abandoned her and took over as CEO at Newman, destroying the company. She even let his family believe and grieve his &quot;death&quot;. He returned alive; but the company was then taken over by Jack and renamed Abbott Enterprises.
