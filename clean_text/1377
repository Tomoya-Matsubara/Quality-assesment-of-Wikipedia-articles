The Earle Mack School of Law is the law school of Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. The school opened in the fall of 2006 and was the first new law school in Philadelphia in over a thirty year time period,1 and is the newest school within Drexel University. Serving only graduate students, the law school offers Juris Doctor degrees and provides the opportunity for all students to take part in a cooperative education program.2
History
In 2005, Drexel University announced its plans to create a new law school adjacent to the Drexel University Main Campus W. W. Hagerty library in West Philadelphia. That same year Drexel received approval from the Pennsylvania Department of Education to start the school.3 The decision to launch a law school with cooperative education in a city with five other law schools was based on a demand for graduates with immediate experience, with the president of Drexel University, Constantine Papadakis, saying that employers &quot;like to hire a graduate and have them immediately be useful.&quot;4 The Earle Mack School of Law joins Temple University, University of Pennsylvania, Villanova University, Rutgers, and Widener University to become the sixth law school in the Delaware Valley. The School of Law is the first new law school to be opened by a doctoral university in a twenty-five year period nationwide.5
 The inaugural class of the Earle Mack School of Law began classes on August 16, 2006. Due to a shortage of construction materials in 2006, caused in part by the need in the gulf coast due to Hurricane Katrina, construction on the law school building was delayed, resulting in classes being held on Drexel University's Main Campus and within the Jenkins Law Library and the auditorium of the National Constitution Center.6 The first class was expected to be composed of 120 students; ultimately, the inaugural class consisted of 183 students with an incoming GPA of 3.4 and an LSAT score of 156.78 The newest admitted class, the class of 2012, consists of 156 students with an incoming GPA of 3.4 and a median LSAT score of 160.9 On May 1, 2008 the Drexel University College of Law was renamed the Earle Mack School of Law in honor of Earle I. Mack, a Drexel University alumnus, after a donation of $15 million dollars.10
As of July 2009, the School of Law has the third-highest Pennsylvania Bar Examination passage rate of any Pennsylvania law school at 89.84%11
Academics
The Law School offers Juris Doctor degrees and joint-degree programs for those pursuing a degree through Drexel University. The Law School received provisional accreditation from the American Bar Association in February 2008 enabling the first graduating class, 2009, to take the bar exam upon graduation.12 The school concentrates on entrepreneurial business, health law, and intellectual property law and currently has 24 full time faculty members.1314 The Law School is the first to have enrolled all of its students in the Philadelphia Bar Association's Young Lawyers Section.1516 The students also have automatic membership to the Jenkins Law Library.17
Cooperative education
 Like Drexel University's The Ultimate Internship, the Law School offers cooperative education for its students. The Law School is the second law school in the country to have a co-op program for law students, the first being Northeastern University.18 The first co-op cycle for the law school started in September 2007 and over ninety area corporations, law offices, judiciary positions, non-profit organizations, and government offices offered internship positions.192021
During their first year at law school students concentrate on basics such as legal writing and contracts before starting their first six month co-op cycle.22 In order to be eligible to participate in the program students must complete their first year with a minimum GPA and satisfy any job orientation that is required. While on co-op students are required to work at least 20 hours a week at their position and take an additional 3 credit hours in either a class or an approved academic program.23
Facilities
In 2005, the Philadelphia Planning Commission approved Drexel's then estimated $13 million temporary law school.24 Construction on the temporary law school building began in the fall of 2006 and was completed during the winter term. The $14 million building opened for classes on January 8, 2007.2526
The  complex features a moot courtroom, a two-floor library, a two-story atrium for meetings and casual conversation, faculty/staff offices, and several rooms available for students to meet and work. The building also shares Drexel's campus-wide wireless Internet access.27
