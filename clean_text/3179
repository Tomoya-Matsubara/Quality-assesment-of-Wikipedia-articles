Joyce Gilchrist is a former forensic chemist who had participated in over 3,000 criminal cases in 21 years while working for the Oklahoma City police department,12, and who was accused of falsifying evidence.34 Her evidence led in part to 23 people being sentenced to death, 11 of whom have been executed.5 After her dismissal, Gilchrist alleged that she was fired in retaliation for reporting sexual misconduct.6
Gilchrist earned the nickname &quot;Black Magic&quot; for her ability to match DNA evidence that other forensic examiners could not.7 She was also known for being unusually adept at testifying and persuading juries, thus obtaining convictions.89 In 1994, Gilchrist was promoted to supervisor from forensic chemist after just 9 years on the job.10 But her colleagues began to raise concerns about her work.111213
Gilchrist was dismissed due to &quot;flawed casework analysis&quot; and &quot;laboratory mismanagement&quot;.14 Concerns about Gilchrist's actions were first raised when a landscaper, Jeffrey Todd Pierce, who had been convicted of rape in 1986 despite a clean record and good alibi largely based on Gilchrist's evidence, was exonerated based on additional DNA evidence. Pierce was released after 15 years in prison. After his release he filed a lawsuit against the state seeking 75 million dollars and charging that Gilchrist and Bob Macy, a now retired district attorney, conspired to produce false evidence against him.15
Other such cases, in which evidence exonerated someone who Gilchrist helped convict, include that of Michael Blair. Blair was sentenced to die for the murder of a little girl in 1993.16 The evidence leading to his conviction included shafts of hair found near the girl's body and in Blair's car.17 New DNA evidence showed that the hair matched neither the girl, nor Blair.18 During the early 1990s, Oklahoma state law did not allow defense attorneys to use government funds to hire another forensic scientists to verify Gilchrist's claims. However, during appeals of Malcolm Rent Johnson's death penalty case, two forensic experts hired by the defense were critical of Gilchrist's testimony, particularly as it relied upon several &quot;blue-colored hairs&quot; that seemed too &quot;ubiquitous&quot; to be useful evidence.19
Over 1,700 cases in which Ghilchrist's evidence was significant to a conviction were reviewed by the state of Oklahoma.2021 Her attorney stated that, &quot;The criticism of her around here is second only to that of Timothy McVeigh.&quot;22. After her dismissal, Gilchrist filed a lawsuit seeking 20.1 million dollars, claiming that her firing was actually motivated by revenge, after she reported sexual misconduct by her supervisor.23
