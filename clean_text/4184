Faildergd&lt;U+00F3&gt;it (later spelled Faildeargdoid or Ailldeargoid), son of Muinem&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. He succeeded to the throne on the death of his father. He is said to have been the first king in Ireland whose subjects wore gold rings (Old Irish failge) on their hands. He ruled for ten years before being killed, either by S&lt;U+00ED&gt;rna mac D&lt;U+00E9&gt;in, or by his successor Ollom Fotla, whose father, F&lt;U+00ED&gt;achu F&lt;U+00ED&gt;nscothach, had been killed by Failderd&lt;U+00F3&gt;it's father Muinem&lt;U+00F3&gt;n.1 The chronology of Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar &lt;U+00C9&gt;irinn dates his reign to 950-943 BC,2 that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 1328-1318 BC.3
