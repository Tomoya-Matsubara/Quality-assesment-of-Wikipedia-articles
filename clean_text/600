Religion in Croatia is chiefly Roman Catholic. During the 1990's there was conflict between the Eastern Orthodox Serbs, the Roman Catholic Croats, and the Muslim Bosniaks. This caused a massive civil war in Bosnia. The constitution provides for freedom of religion. Approximately 5.5% of Croats self-identify as non-religious.1 Although the Croatian government requires religious teaching in public schools, attendance is not mandated. There is no state religion, although the Catholic Church receives public funding and other benefits.
