The 1796&lt;U+2013&gt;97 Siege of Kehl lasted from October 1796 to 9 January 1797, during the War of the First Coalition (part of the French Revolutionary Wars). Habsburg and W&lt;U+00FC&gt;rttemberg regulars, numbering 40,000, under the command of Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour besieged and captured the French-controlled fortress of Kehl, across the Rhine River from Strasbourg.
The French defenders under Louis Desaix and the overall commander of the French force, Jean Victor Marie Moreau, almost upset the siege when they executed a sortie that nearly succeeded in capturing the Austrian artillery park. After the defenses were thoroughly riddled by heavy bombardment from the besiegers, the French defenders capitulated and withdrew in 9 January 1797.
Background

Initially, the rulers of Europe viewed the revolution in France as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791, the situation surrounding his sister, Marie Antoinette, and her children, alarmed him. In August 1791, in consultation with French &lt;U+00E9&gt;migr&lt;U+00E9&gt; nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pilnitz, in which they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The French &lt;U+00E9&gt;migr&lt;U+00E9&gt;s continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution abroad. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. In this War of the First Coalition (1792&lt;U+2013&gt;98), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire. A key to the French success was the army's ability to cross the Rhine at will. The crossings at H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen, near the Swiss city of Basle, and the crossing at Kehl, near the Alsatian city of Strasbourg, gave them ready-access to most of southwestern Germany; from there, French armies could sweep north, south, or march east, depending on their military goal. The imperial army had laid siege to Kehl, but the garrison there had successfully defended themselves.1
Terrain
 The Rhine River flows west along the border between the German states and the Swiss Cantons. The  stretch between Rheinfall, by Schaffhausen and Basel, the High Rhine (Hochrhein) cuts through steep hillsides over a gravel bed; in such paces as the former rapids at Laufenburg, it moves in torrents.2 A few miles north and east of Basel, the terrain flattens. The Rhine makes a wide, northerly turn, in what is called the Rhine knee, and enters the so-called Rhine ditch (Rheingraben), part of a rift valley bordered by the Black Forest on the east and Vosges Mountains on the west. In 1796, the plain on both sides of the river, some  wide, was dotted with villages and farms. At both far edges of the flood plain, especially on the eastern side, the old mountains created dark shadows on the horizon. Tributaries cut through the hilly terrain of the Black Forest, creating deep defiles in the mountains. The tributaries then wind in rivulets through the flood plain to the river.3
The Rhine River itself looked different in the 1790s than it does in the 21st century; the passage from Basel to Iffezheim was &quot;corrected&quot; (straightened) between 1817 and 1875. Between 1927 and 1975, a canal was constructed to control the water level. In 1790, though, the river was wild and unpredictable, in some places more than four or more times wider than the twenty-first century, even under regular conditions. Its channels wound through marsh and meadow, and created islands of trees and vegetation that were periodically submerged by floods. It was crossable at Kehl, by Strasbourg, and H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen, by Basel, where systems of viaducts and causeways made access reliable.4
Campaign in 1796

In 1796, Jean Baptiste Jourdan initiated a plan against the Archduke Charles main imperial army, near Kehl. Jourdan's idea was to crush Charles north of Kehl; if he could not do that, he would at least push Charles back into Bavaria, and from there to Austria, forcing a culminating battle somewhere along the Danube between Passau and Vienna. In this way, he could pressure the House of Habsburg into submission. Jean Victor Moreau led his army across the Rhine at H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen to support Jourdan's plan. After crossing, he swung north, and proceeded down the Rhine, on the east side, toward Kehl. After some initial French successes, Charles withdrew to the border between W&lt;U+00FC&gt;rttemberg and Bavaria. In following him, the French over-stretched their supply lines and their flanks, while Charles was able to condense and shorten his. He subsequently outmaneuvered Moreau and separated him from Jourdan's flank. This required both French armies had to withdraw across southern Germany to the west slope of the Black Forest. There, at Emmendingen (19 October) and Schliengen (26 October), the Austrian forces, combined with the small but exuberant emigres of the Army of Cond&lt;U+00E9&gt;, pushed the French army to the Rhine. With its back to the river, Jourdan and Moreau had to retreat across the Rhine into France, retaining the t&lt;U+00EA&gt;te-du-ponts of the star-shaped fortresses at Kehl and H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen.5
Diplomacy and politics
The fortresses at H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen and Kehl were both important bridgeheads across the river; maintaining control of them had been critical in relative ease of the French crossing to the German side of the Rhine. The principal fortresses lay on the west side (French side) of the Rhine; the bridgeheads and the smaller fortifications surrounding those lay on the west side. Louis XIV ordered the construction of the fortress by the famous architect, S&lt;U+00E9&gt;bastien Le Prestre de Vauban (1679&lt;U+2013&gt;81), resulting in the construction of the star-shaped fortresses and bridgeheads in both locations.6
Charles had formulated a plan to circumvent that problem, and to free enough of his troops to send a sizable relief fortress into northern Italy, where Dagoburt von Wurmser held Mantua against the French. If the French would agree to an armistice, he could take command of the fortresses; the French would withdraw, and he could send a sizable force to northern Italy to help relieve Mantua. The Siege of Mantua was long and costly, and had tied up a significant portion of both the French and Austrian force. The French Directory was willing to give up the Mantua in exchange for the Rhine bridgeheads, which they deemed important for the defense of France; General Clark, their envoy sent to negotiate between the Austrians and the French in Italy, could not convince Napoleon Bonaparte to allow the Habsburgs to keep Mantua. He flatly refused the suggesting, maintaining the Mantua was the keystone to Habsburg Italy.7
Simultaneously, Jourdan had offered an armistice to Charles in keeping with his own goals. He advised his brother of this offer, but it was flatly refused by his brother and the civilian military advisers on the Aulic Council. He was instructed to lay siege to the fortresses, to take them, and secure any possible access to southern Germany via the Rhine. Consequently, by tying him down at the Rhine, besieging to Vauban fortresses across the river, the Council effectively sealed the fate of Wurmser's troops in Mantua. With the failure of Paul Davidovich's column to reach their beleaguered in Mantua, Wurmser hoped still that Joseph Alvintzy relief column would cross the Adige river.93.&quot;/&gt; After it became clear that Charles was locked into place at Kehl and H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen, Moreau moved 14 Demi-brigades to Italy, leaving behind modest forces on the Rhine.8
Laying siege
Once the Aulic Council refused Charles's plans,Latour engaged the main French force at Kehl and Charles entrusted to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Aloys zu F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg the command of the siege force at H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen.9 The process of laying siege was complicated. Most commonly, armies established positions around a city and waited for the surrender of those inside. Quite commonly, they might bribe or coerce someone inside to betray the fortification. An attacker, aware of a prolonged siege's great cost in time, money and lives, might offer generous terms to a defender who surrendered quickly. The defending troops would be allowed to march away unharmed, often retaining their weapons. As a siege progressed, the surrounding army would build earthworks (a line of circumvallation) to completely encircle their target, preventing food, water, and other supplies from reaching the besieged city.10 Generally, time was on the side of the defenders; most armies could not afford to wait out the prosecution of a siege, especially of a well fortified, well provisioned city. Until the invention of gunpowder-based weapons (and the resulting higher-velocity projectiles), the balance of power and logistics definitely favored the defender. With the introduction of gunpowder, cannon and mortars and howitzers (in modern times), the traditional methods of defense became less effective against a determined siege.11
Conduct of the siege at Kehl
Realizing that the siege was imminent, the French had destroyed most of the village of Kehl on 26 February (as the Battle of Schliengen concluded). Only the church and post house walls remained, in ruins.12 They maintained control of the three main islands surrounding the Kehl crossings: Ilse de Estacade, Ilse de Escargots, and Isle de Ehrlin. These remained throughout essential positions upon which the French established their operations. The islands were semi-connected to Kehl and to each other through a series of flying bridges (pontoon bridges); troops could also be moved by boat if necessary.13
Baillet de Latour immediately lay the groundwork for a lengthy siege by ordering the construction of extensive earthworks around the bridgehead. This allowed Austrian marksmen close access to the bridgeworks, where they could, ostensibly, pick off French defenders. It also allowed them to begin to tunnel under the bridgehead walls and to establish artillery batteries that could fire at closer range to the walls. The French had made several night sorties on the works of the besiegers. In these forays, they would chase the diggers out of the lines, but the Austrian reserves always recovered the works before the French could capture any cannons or destroy the construction. Consequently, every day, the Austrians expanded their works and erected new batteries. They built some new trenches on the left of the Schutter, by the entrance to the old village of Kehl.14
Action of 22 November
The arrival of General Desaix earlier in the month had strengthened the French garrison sufficiently to for the French to consider a sizable sortie of 16,000 infantry and 3000-4000 cavalry against the combined Austrian and W&lt;U+00FC&gt;rttemberg positions. Soldiers had constructed pallisades and heavy artillery augmented the French earthworks. Simultaneously, the Baillet de Latour had also ordered the augmentation of the Imperial earthworks. Before the besiegers could finish their digging, however, Desaix ordered a sortie in which his troops attacked the lines of contravallation between the Kinzig and the Rhine. They departed from the small island of Erlen, in the Rhine, and from the left of the entrenchment camp. The first column forced the two first Imperial redoubts. Another penetrated the earthen works near the center and carried the village of Sundheim and the two redoubts that ran contiguously to the village. However, additional troops intended to support the first wave had not arrived in time, and the entire French sortie party withdrew, taking 700 prisoners, seven pieces of cannon, and two howitzers. The want of horses prevented them from taking another 15 pieces of cannon, which they spiked.15
This action was the principal assault on the Austrian/Imperial line and apparently took the besiegers with some surprise. Latour and the archduke in person moved to the gap the French created, pulling six battalions of armed workmen and all the Austrian troops after them. Thick fog favored their action, because it prevented the French from reconnoitering and, as Moreau reported later, the humidity on the ground impeded the march of their columns. The fighting was heavy, though. General Moreau himself was wounded (head) and his aide-de-camp L&lt;U+00E9&gt;l&lt;U+00E9&gt;e was badly wounded. General Desaix's horse was killed under him, and he received a contusion in his leg, and General Latour's horse was also shot from under him.16 The action of 22 November convinced the French that the Austrians and Imperial forces were too numerous and too well established for the French to shake. The French instead focused their efforts on reinforcing their palisades, strengthening batteries and developing the redoubts and earthen works.17
Expansion of the siege
By 6 December, the Austrian and Imperial defenses were connected in a grand parallel, a series of batteries in a semicircle around the village. On the morning, the Austrians opened fire simultaneously with their batteries, and maintained a salvo the entire day. At four in the afternoon, they attacked a French position, which was defended by 300 men. They succeeded in taking it, but the French counter-attacked, and recovered it, taking also some prisoners. At the same time, the Austrians attacked the other works, called the Bonnet de Pretre, where only 20 men were posted, and succeeded in taking it, and afterward connected it to the network of fortifications.18
By late December, the Austrian batteries were completed and the French expected a general attack on 1 January. According to spies and deserters, the archduke himself had been exhorting and cajoling his troops to lift their spirits, &quot;prepared his troops by harangues and presents,&quot; according to Moreau. On 1 January, after a lengthy salvo, twelve Imperial battalions attacked the outer redoubt and the right wing of the French entrenchment, drove the French out, and immediately took possession of the earthen works and six pieces of artillery. French reserves had not been able to traverse the Rhine in sufficient time; boats intended to transport such troops had been damaged by the lengthy cannon fire. The connecting bridges, which had also been damaged, were repaired quickly, but by the time these repairs had been made, the Austrians were deeply entrenched in their new positions and the French could not force them out. Even miners, who had dug under the trenches, were unable to blow up the redoubt.19
Surrender
At 1000 on 9 January the French general Desaix proposed the evacuation to General Latour and they agreed that the Austrians would enter Kehl the next day, on 10 January (21 Niv&lt;U+00F4&gt;se) at 1600. The French instantly repaired the bridge, which was rendered passable by 1400, which gave them 24 hours to evacuate everything of value and to raze everything else. By the time Latour took possession of the fortress, nothing remained of any use: all palisades, ammunition, even the carriages of the bombs and howitzers, had been evacuated. The French insured that nothing remained behind that could be used by the Austrian/Imperial army; even the fortress itself was but earth and ruins. The siege concluded 115 days after its investment, and following 50 days of open trenches, the point at which active fighting began.20
Aftermath

After the Battle at Schliengen, Charles sent Karl Alyos zu F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg to H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen with a force that included two divisions with 20 battalions of infantry and 40 squadrons of cavalry. It spoke highly of Charles' confidence in F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg that the Archduke would charge him with the taking of the H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen bridgehead. His confidence was well-placed; on 27 October 1796, F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg initiated the siege works before H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen, opening and draining the trenches and beginning construction on the contravallation.21 The capitulation at Kehl in January allowed Charles to send additional troops to H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen. On 2 February 1797, as the Austrians prepared to storm the bridgehead, General of Division Georges Joseph Dufour, the French commander who had replaced the deceased Jean Charles Abbatucci, pre-empted what would have been a costly attack, offering to surrender the bridge. On 5 February, F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg finally took possession. Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, appointed him as Colonel and Proprietor of the Infantry Regiment Nr. 36, which bore his name until his death in battle in 1799.22
