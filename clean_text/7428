Air India Express Flight 812 was a scheduled passenger service from Dubai to Mangalore which at around 01:00 UTC on 22 May 2010,12 overshot the runway on landing, fell over a cliff and caught fire, spreading wreckage across the surrounding hillside.345 Of the 160 passengers and six crew members on board, only eight passengers survived.678910
With its 158 fatalities, the accident was the third deadliest aviation disaster in India, after the 1996 Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision which killed 349, and the 1978 crash of Air India Flight 855, which killed 213.11 It marked the first major Indian aviation accident since the July 2000 crash of Alliance Air Flight 7412 in Patna.12 At the time, the accident was the deadliest crash of a 737 aircraft (all series) and the eighth hull loss of a  aircraft.13 The crash caused the highest number of aviation fatalities in 2010 and was the second of the year to involve a 737–800.14 It was also the second time that an aircraft had overshot the runway at Mangalore.
Flight history
The accident involved a Boeing 737-8NG aircraft, one of Boeing's 737 Next Generation series, with aircraft registration VT–AXV and manufacturer's serial number 36333, line number 2481.15 The aircraft first flew on 20 December 2007 with the Boeing test registration N1787B and was delivered on 18 January 2008.1617 Commanded by Captain Zlatko Glu&lt;U+0161&gt;ica, the remaining crew consisted of first officer H.S. Ahluwalia and four cabin attendants.1819 Glu&lt;U+0161&gt;ica, a British and Serbian national with over 10,000 hours of flying and over 7,500 hours of command experience, and Ahluwalia (a former employee of Jat Airways who joined Air India in April 2009) were both killed in the incident.202122 The first officer was based in Mangalore and the captain in Frankfurt, from where he had flown in as a passenger the previous day.23
Flight
Following its scheduled departure time of 22:35 (UTC) from Dubai International Airport in Dubai, the plane crashed upon landing on the  runway number 06/24 at Mangalore International Airport at around 01:00 UTC. Situated in a hilly area, the airport is one of seven Indian airports designated as a &quot;critical airfield&quot; by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. DGCA rules at critical airfields prohibit &quot;supervised take offs and landings&quot;, so that only the captain (not the first officer) may pilot an aircraft during take-off and landing.24252627 The airport is one of three airports in India having table top runways (the others being Kozhikode and Lengpui)28 that require a very precise landing approach.29
Crash
 After touching down, the plane overran runway 06/24 and crashed down the hill at its far end.30 The final conversations between Air traffic control (ATC) and the pilot prior to the landing showed no indication of distress.3132
The then Civil Aviation Minister, Praful Patel said that the aircraft was following an Instrument landing system (ILS) approach for landing on the newer runway, which was commissioned in 2006. The pilot reported to ATC that it was 'established' on an ILS approach about  from touchdown; landing clearance was then given at  from touchdown. The aeroplane concluded its ILS approach on runway 24, touching down  past the touch down zone, then overran the runway and ploughed through a  sand arrestor bed which did not stop it. As the aircraft passed the arrester bed, its starboard wing collided with the concrete socket of the ILS localiser antenna, it then plunged over the cliff and on to the hillside coming to a stop  metres past the top of the slope.33
&quot;The plane broke in two&quot; said one survivor &quot;and a dense black smoke invaded the cabin. I jumped out through an opening in the window. Six other passengers followed me. We fled, with the help of the inhabitants of the nearby village&quot;.34 Television footage from shortly after the crash showed the remains of the aircraft on fire and lying on its belly with smoke rising from the wreckage.35 The minister also stated that weather conditions were normal with a visibility of , and said wind conditions were calm and there was no rain at the time of the crash. A drizzle started only after the accident.3637 Initial reports from survivors suggested a tyre burst as the aircraft attempted a go-around.38
Victims
Apart from the six crew members, a total of 160 passengers were on board at the time of the crash.39 Although there were 169 names on the original passenger list, nine did not board the flight.40 All the bodies were recovered from the wreckage.41 Karnataka Home Minister V. S. Acharya said eight people were initially reported to have survived, although one person died of his injuries42 – this was however refuted by an Air India spokesman who confirmed that all initial survivors were alive.43 This confusion arose after fire fighters rescued a little girl who died on the way to hospital.44 The airport manager at Mangalore, Peter Abraham confirmed that there were difficulties when trying to reach the plane.4546

On 27 July 2010, the names of all the victims were inscribed on a memorial installed near the crash site 48 which was destroyed by vandals on 5 October 2010.49
Rescue and response
 Local villagers were among the first on the scene to help50 while an estimated 15 fire trucks, 20 ambulances and 100 rescue workers were immediately allocated to rescue operations.5152 Karnataka Western Range Inspector General of Police, Gopal Hosur, said that eight to ten people had been moved to hospitals, and that the Karnataka Police force, bomb squad, Karnataka Fire &amp; Emergency Services, Karnataka State Reserve Police and all hospitals were working together to help out. The Central Industrial Security Force sent 150 personnel to Mangalore to help in the relief and rescue operations.53 Bodies of all of the deceased were recovered from the crash site on the day of the crash,54 with relatives of the deceased receiving 87 of the bodies.55
After the rapid establishment of a special emergency information service,56 Praful Patel, Indian Civil Aviation minister, arrived from New Delhi to be at the scene57 and the one-year-in-office celebrations of the UPA government's second tenure were postponed.58 Patel was soon followed by Karnataka Chief Minister B. S. Yeddyurappa and Kerala Chief Minister V. S. Achuthanandan to take control of the situation. The chairperson of the governing UPA, Sonia Gandhi issued a message of grief and wished a &quot;speedy recovery&quot; to all.59 The Indian Minister for Civil Aviation, Praful Patel, took moral responsibility for the accident and offered to resign his post, an offer rejected by the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh.60 Many countries and organisations expressed sorrow and condolences to the people of India over the crash.61 The accident was predicted to cost the insurers, and their reinsurers .6263 Air India's insurance company paid out  in settlement of the hull loss,6465 and the company had already received , that is 60% of the estimated .66
Investigation
Initial investigations revealed that the plane landed about  beyond the usual touch down point on Mangalore's new  runway 24.6768 A team of airline officials and staff from the Airports Authority of India were rushed to the scene to investigate the incident and assist with rescue efforts.69 Boeing also announced that a team would be sent to provide technical assistance following a request from Indian authorities.70 The Directorate General of Civil Aviation ordered an inquiry into the crash, which began the same day.71 The NTSB also assisted the investigation by sending a team of specialists including a senior air safety investigator, a flight operations specialist, an aircraft systems specialist and technical advisers for Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration.72
According to audio transcripts obtained from ATC, Serbian pilot Zlatko Glu&lt;U+0161&gt;ica, aged 55, was given clearance to land, however, he suddenly aborted the attempted landing. The aircraft's throttle handle was reportedly found in the forward position, suggesting that the pilot had attempted to abort the landing and take off again.73 According to unnamed ATC sources at Mangalore, the co-pilot Ahluwalia was said to have warned his commander more than once to go around instead of landing,74 and that this warning had come at a height of , well before the aircraft made a touch down.75
The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) was recovered on 23 May,76 and the flight data recorder (FDR) two days later.77 The recorders were sent to New Delhi by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation for data acquisition and analysis78 and subsequently to the US NTSB for investigation.79 DGCA official Zaidi claimed &quot;better data protection&quot; while unnamed officials mentioned heavy damage to the devices.80 In direct response to the accident81 the Government of India decided to set up an independent air accident enquiry board called the Civil Aviation Authority that would function independently of the DGCA.82 Effectively this meant that the DGCA would be the regulator and the CAA the investigator.83 The Director General of the DGCA said that it would be set up though legislation, and would comply with the recommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organization.84
The enquiry report submitted by the Civil Aviation Ministry claimed that the Glusica slept for over 90 minutes during the flight. The Air India Express IC 812  carrying 166 people from Dubai including the crew, crashed while negotiating a tricky landing at Mangalore city's &quot;table-top&quot; airport overlooking a ravine. The American National Transportation Safety Board says it was the first instance of snoring recorded on a Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR).85 Analysis of the accident revealed that had the pilot &quot;deployed d&lt;U+00E9&gt;tente reverse thrust and applied maximum manual braking at touchdown&quot;, the aircraft could have been stopped within the paved overrun area of the runway. The captain had exacerbated the long landing by attempting a go-around following deployment of the thrust reversers.86
Court of Inquiry
On 3 June 2010, the Government of India appointed Former Vice Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Bhushan Nilkanth Gokhale as head of a Court of Inquiry to investigate the air crash.87 The &quot;Gokhale Inquiry&quot; was to investigate the reasons behind the crash,88 and submit its findings by 31 August 2010, a deadline later extended by a month to 30 September 2010.89 The Government also appointed four experts to this Court of Inquiry to assist in the investigation.90 The Court of Inquiry started its investigations by visiting the crash site on 7 June 2010,91 and visited all eight crash survivors to gather information.92
On 17 August 2010, the Court of Inquiry began a three day public hearing in Mangalore to interview airport officials and witnesses.93 On day one, airport and airline officials deposed that the aircraft had approached at an altitude higher than usual, and that it had landed beyond the threshold point. They also mentioned that the airport's radar was operational from 20 May 2010.94 The airport chief fire officer testified that crash tenders had taken four minutes to reach the aircraft95 because the road leading away from the airport perimeter to the crash site was very narrow and undulating. On day two transcript of the cockpit to ATC conversation was released,96 which indicated that the co-pilot had suggested a &quot;go around&quot; after the pilot informed ATC that it was 'clear to land'.97
Doctors who conducted post mortems on the bodies recovered recorded that most victims had died of burns.98 On day four Air India's flight safety officer informed the inquiry that the aircraft's thrust lever and thrust reverse levers were both in the forward position,99 possibly indicating that the pilot intended to go around. The inquiry panel stated that information from the FDR would released at the next hearing of the Court of Inquiry in New Delhi on 3 September 2010,100 and that of the CVR soon after. The Court of Inquiry would submit its report on 30 September 2010.101
On 8 September 2010, details from the CVR and FDR were presented to the Court of Inquiry. The CVR analysis revealed that one of the pilots was asleep in the cockpit.102 For 110 minutes the CVR had picked up no conversation from the pilots, with the report adding that the sound of nasal snoring and deep breathing could be heard during this recording.103 The FDR analysis indicated that the flight started its descent at an altitude of , instead of the normal . The aircraft also touched down at the  mark on the runway instead of the  mark,104 whereupon the pilot then tried to take off with just  of the runway remaining which resulted in the crash. Both pilots had been aware of the wrong flight path since they are both heard saying &quot;Flight is taking wrong path and wrong side&quot;, while the aircraft's instruments had given repeated warnings of this.105
On 16 November 2010, five months after the Court of Inquiry was constituted, it submitted its report with input from the NTSB and Boeing, and stated that pilot error was the cause of the accident since the flight path was incorrect.106107108
Compensation
The Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh announced  or &lt;U+20AC&gt;3,390) for the families of the dead and  for the injured to be allocated from the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund.109 Karnataka Chief Minister Yeddyurappa has also announced compensation of  to the families of the dead.110 In addition to this, the Civil Aviation Ministry advised that the Airline will provide up to  to family members of each victim as per the provisions of the Indian Carriage by Air (Amendment) Act which follows the Montreal Convention.111112
The Airline announced interim compensation of  for passengers above 12 years of age,  for passengers below 12 years of age and  for every injured passenger. This compensation is over and above the ex-gratia payment announced by the Prime Minister.113 Additionally, Air India has said it would offer jobs to the survivors.114 As of 11 June 2010 an amount of  had been distributed as compensation to the families of the victims and to the eight survivors.115 Victims' families have become increasingly vocal as to the inequitable nature of compensation paid out by Air India,116117 and also of the alleged hostile attitude of the airline's counsel.118
Members of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) along with Kasargod MP P Karunkaran staged a protest on 8 September 2010 at the airline's office in Mangalore where they submitted a memorandum to officials demanding that families of the victims receive early and equitable settlements of compensation due. They also demanded the settlement process be made more transparent by opening it to the media rather than holding sessions in camera.119
