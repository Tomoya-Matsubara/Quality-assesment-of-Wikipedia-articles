Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment Ltd. (MLSE) is a professional sports and commercial real estate company based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. With assets that include franchises in three of the six major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, it is the largest sports and entertainment company in Canada, and one of the largest in North America.
The primary holdings of the company are its major sports franchises, the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League, Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association and Toronto FC of Major League Soccer, as well as the minor league Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League and an unnamed soccer team to be launched in the USL PRO in 2015. In addition, it owns the Air Canada Centre, the home arena of the Maple Leafs and Raptors. MLSE also manages or has invested in several other sports facilities including BMO Field, home of Toronto FC, Ricoh Coliseum, home of the Marlies, MasterCard Centre, the practice facility of the Maple Leafs and Marlies, KIA Training Ground, practice facility for Toronto FC and home of the TFC Academy, and Lamport Stadium.
MLSE was founded by Conn Smythe in 1931 as Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL) to act as a holding company for the Maple Leafs and their planned new arena Maple Leaf Gardens, from which the company got its name. Smythe transferred his ownership of the Leafs to the company in exchange for shares in MLGL, and sold shares in the holding company to the public to help fund construction of the arena. While initially primarily a hockey company, with ownership stakes in a number of minor and junior hockey clubs including the Toronto Marlboros of the Ontario Hockey Association, the company later branched out to own the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League from the late 1970s to late 1980s, before merging with the Raptors, who were constructing the Air Canada Centre at the time, and adopting their current name in 1998. Most recently the company launched Toronto FC in 2007.
Over most of its 80 plus years of existence MLSE was a public company. Following the death of majority owner Harold Ballard in 1990, Steve Stavro led a controversial bid to buy the company and take it private. Most recently, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan sold their 79.53% share of the company for $1.32 billion to a joint venture between Rogers Communications and Bell Canada, two of Canada's largest media companies, giving the company an equity value of $1.66 billion and an enterprise value of $2 billion. (All figures are in Canadian dollars (CAD) unless otherwise specified.) Although the company has proven to be very profitable, they have had much less success at producing winning teams. Of the three major franchises they currently own (Maple Leafs, Raptors and Toronto FC), only the Maple Leafs have ever won a championship, but not since their 1967 Stanley Cup. The only other major championship the company has won was the 74th Grey Cup in 1986 by the Tiger-Cats.
Corporate history
Founding
 The corporation's roots can be traced back to 1927, when Conn Smythe organized a group of investors to purchase Toronto's premier hockey franchise, the Toronto St. Patricks of the National Hockey League, which had earned Stanley Cup championships in 1918 (as the Toronto Arenas) and 1922, from a group headed by Charles Querrie. The club was playing poorly and minority partner Jack Bickell contacted Smythe about becoming coach of the team. However, Smythe told Bickell that he was more interested in buying a stake in the team. Not long after, with the team in trouble financially due to majority owner Querrie having lost a lawsuit to former Toronto Blueshirts owner Eddie Livingstone, Querrie put the St. Pats up for sale and agreed in principle to sell them for $200,000 to a group that would move the team to Philadelphia.1 After Bickell contacted Smythe to inform him of the sale, Smythe persuaded Querrie that civic pride was more important than money and put together a syndicate that bought the St. Pats. Smythe himself invested $10,000 of his own money and his group contributed $75,000 up front and a further $75,000 due 30 days later, with Bickell retaining his $40,000 share in the team.23 The deal was finalized on Valentine's Day,4 and the new owners quickly renamed the team the Toronto Maple Leafs.5 Later that year, Smythe bought the junior hockey Toronto Marlboros of the Ontario Hockey Association to serve as a developmental team for Maple Leafs.67

The Toronto Maple Leafs, the primary asset of MLGL for many years, play a home game at the Gardens in 1994

In 1929, Smythe decided, in the midst of the Great Depression, that the Maple Leafs needed a new arena. Their then home, the Arena Gardens, which they shared with the Marlboros,8 had been built in 1912 and seated just 8,000, which the Maple Leafs were regularly filling. After considering various locations, the site at the corner of Carlton and Church was purchased from The T. Eaton Co. Ltd. for $350,000,9 a price said to be $150,000 below market value. A new 12,473 seat (14,550 including standing room) arena was designed by the architectural firm of Ross and Macdonald. To finance construction, Smythe got backing from Sun Life for half of the expected $1 million cost10 and launched Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL), a management company that would own both the Maple Leafs and the new arena, which was named Maple Leaf Gardens (MLG).11 A public offering of shares in MLGL was made at $10 each ($ in  dollars), with a free common share for each five preferred shares purchased.12 Ownership of the hockey team was transferred to MLGL in return for shares. To fund construction of the building, workers were paid 20% of their salary in MLG stock.1314 Construction started on 1 June 1931,15 and MLG was opened five months and two weeks later, on 12 November 1931, at a cost of $1.5 million1617 ($ in  dollars). The Marlboros also moved to the new arena.18
To help fill dates at the new arena, Smythe acquired an expansion franchise in the professional International Lacrosse League on behalf of MLGL for the 1932 season,1920 which was also given the name the Toronto Maple Leafs.2122 A team named the Toronto Maple Leafs had competed in the first season of the ILL at the Arena Gardens,2324 but was renamed the Tecumsehs with the arrival of Smythe's team.2526 Both teams played at MLG.2728 Smythe pulled out following the season due to financial losses,29 and the league did not play the following year.
Minor hockey expansion
The company has owned numerous minor league hockey teams over the years, which have served as developmental farm teams for the Maple Leafs. A group backed by Smythe and Frank Selke of the Montreal Canadiens was awarded an American Hockey league franchise for Rochester, New York in July 1956, after a local group could not come up with the $150,000 USD in capital required by the league.30313233 The Leafs and Canadiens would each own 27.5% of the team, with the balance sold to Rochester interests.3435 The team was named the Rochester Americans. The Amerks were a joint affiliate of both the Canadiens and the Maple Leafs,36 though the club was operated by the Canadiens.37 In the summer of 1959 the Maple Leafs bought out the Canadiens' ownership share of the club, giving them a 55% controlling interest, due to concerns that with Montreal operating the club they were giving their prospects priority over those of the Leafs.3839 They purchased most of the remaining 45% in 1963,404142 boosting their ownership share to 98% by November 1964.43 In July 1966 the Maple Leafs sold the team to a group which included their then General Manager Punch Imlach for a reported $400,000.4445464748
In June 1963 the Spokane Comets Western Hockey League franchise was purchased by a group lead by the Maple Leafs, who relocated them to become the Denver Invaders and act as the Leaf's farm team.49505152 Though the league did not acknowledge that the Maple Leafs had an ownership stake in the team,5354 they held a majority position with the Denver partners only owning roughly 36%.555657 Following reported losses of $150,000 in their first season,58 Smythe announced that the team would be relocated after the team failed to reach a 2,000 season ticket target by a league-imposed deadline.5960616263 The team became the Victoria Maple Leafs for the following season.64 In June 1967 MLGL sold the team for $500,000 to a group from Phoenix,65666768 which relocated it to become the Phoenix Roadrunners.697071
In 1964 MLGL the Tulsa Oilers of the Central Professional Hockey League were launched. The team was owned and operated by MLGL as a developmental club for the Maple Leafs.72 In the spring of 1973 it was announced that the Oilers would relocate to become the Oklahoma City Blazers.7374 Prior to the 1976&lt;U+2013&gt;77 season the Maple Leafs decided to share an affiliate with the Chicago Black Hawks in an attempt to reduce costs,7576 and pulled out of the Blazers. In 1978 the New Brunswick Hawks of the American Hockey League (AHL) were established,77 and were jointly operated by the Chicago Black Hawks and the Toronto Maple Leafs as their farm team.78798081828384 MLGL and the Black Hawks each owned half of the franchise.85868788 However, by 1980 MLGL had decided that the Leafs needed a team of their own,89 with a spokesperson citing the limited number of roster spots as the rationale for the move.9091 In 1981 the Cincinnati Tigers of the old Central Hockey League were established under the ownership of MLGL,92939495 but the team averaged only 1,500 fans and lost $750,000 in their first season and folded the following spring.969798 Shortly thereafter, with Chicago having pulled out of New Brunswick in favour of affiliating with the Springfield Indians on their own,99100 the Leafs relocated the New Brunswick Hawks to St. Catharines, Ontario to establish the St. Catharines Saints as their farm team.101102103 The team played in St. Catharines until 1986, and after stops in Newmarket, Ontario as the Newmarket Saints (1986&lt;U+2013&gt;1991) and St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador as the St. John's Maple Leafs (1991&lt;U+2013&gt;2005), the team moved to Toronto as the Toronto Marlies (named after the company's former junior team) where they have been playing ever since.104105
The Toronto Marlboros served as a junior farm team for the Maple Leafs for 40 years until direct NHL sponsorship of junior clubs ended in 1967 when the NHL made the Entry Draft universal.106107 In October 1988, with the team losing hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, MLGL reached an agreement to sell the Marlboros for a reported $500,000, severing their ties with the Maple Leafs.108109110111112 However, the Leafs retained the rights to the Marlies name.113114115 The OHL team moved to Hamilton for the 1989&lt;U+2013&gt;90 season, becoming the Dukes of Hamilton.116117
Growth beyond hockey
In 1967 MLGL entered into negotiations to purchase the financially struggling Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team of the minor AAA International League.118119120121 The asking price was $60,000.122 The deal ultimately fell apart due to concerns about the team's stadium, Maple Leaf Stadium, which needed up to $250,000 in repairs and whose owner wanted $4 million to purchase it,123124 and the team was sold and relocated to become the Louisville Colonels for the following season. MLGL owner Harold Ballard said that the company's interest was due in part to help position itself to go after a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise for Toronto.125126 In early 1974 MLGL announced plans to build a new baseball stadium in Toronto,127 but the city ultimately decided to renovate Exhibition Stadium to make it suitable for baseball.128129 At the time, the MLGL group, led by Lorne Duguid, vice-president of Hiram Walker Distillers and MLGL executive,130 was one of at least four bidding for a Toronto MLB team, including competing groups led by Labatt Brewing Company, Robert Hunter, the former President of the International League Maple Leafs, and Canadian Baseball Co, led by Sydney Cooper.131132133134 After negotiating with the owners of the Baltimore Orioles, Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians135 and Oakland Athletics in their attempt to acquire a team for Toronto,136 MLGL offered $15 million for the San Francisco Giants137 but the team's owner decided in early 1976 to sell the club to the Labatt group for $13.25 million USD.138 While the Giant's relocation was ultimately rejected by a U.S. court,139 Labatt was awarded an expansion team in the American League that became the Toronto Blue Jays for $7 million USD later that year.140141142
A team named the Toronto Maple Leafs competed in the inaugural season of the National Lacrosse Association, a professional box lacrosse league, in 1968 at MLG.143 MLGL owners Ballard and Stafford Smythe were two of the five founding partners of the club,144 but financial difficulties forced MLGL to take over ownership midway though the season.145146147 The NLA suspended operations prior to the following season.148149

Ivor Wynne Stadium, home of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats which MLGL owned from the late 1970s to the late 1980s

In the early 1970s MLGL announced plans to apply for a second Toronto based Canadian Football League team, in addition to the Toronto Argonauts, which would play at Varsity Stadium, but the proposal never went anywhere.150151152 In 1974, when his former partner John Bassett put the Argonauts up for sale for $3.3 million, Ballard expressed interest in buying the team, but it was ultimately sold to William R. Hodgson.153154155156157158 Shortly thereafter Ballard tried to buy the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the CFL from owner Michael DeGroote, but this offer was also rejected. Three money-losing seasons later, in February 1978, DeGroote sold the team to MLGL for $1.3 million.159160161162163 During his tenure as owner of the Tiger-Cats, Ballard repeatedly threatened to move the franchise to Toronto's Varsity Stadium,164 which was vetoed by the Argos,165 and claimed to have lost roughly $20 million over 11 seasons.166 MLGL sold the team in March 1989 to David Braley for $2.167168169170
Ruby Richman, the former coach of Canada men's national basketball team, working with Ballard pursued a number of existing National Basketball Association (NBA) and American Basketball Association (ABA) teams to relocate to Toronto to play at MLG in the 1970s.171172173 Richman had a tentative agreement to purchase both the Miami Floridians and Pittsburgh Condors of the ABA with a plan to merge them into a single Toronto based team, but the deal fell through.174 Later, Richman held negotiations with the Detroit Pistons, which were seeking $5 million for the franchise, but pulled out when the price was raised to $8.25 million.175 MLGL attempted to purchase and relocate the Buffalo Braves, which had played a number of regular season games at MLG over the years, to Toronto in 1974 for $8.5 million,176177 and again several times later,178179180181 but the owners eventually chose to move the team to San Diego.182183 When Toronto was awarded an expansion NBA franchise in 1974 for the 1975&lt;U+2013&gt;76 season184185186 MLGL was one of three groups to bid for the rights to the team,187188189190 but the club never materialized as no group was able to secure funding for the expansion fee of $6.8 million.191192193 MLGL attempted to purchase and relocate the Houston Rockets in 1975, which were seeking $8 million for the team, but the team's lease ultimately prevented a relocation.194195196 In 1976 MLGL attempted to buy the Atlanta Hawks.197198 In 1979 a Toronto group which included Ballard again pushed for an expansion franchise, but lost out to the Dallas Mavericks.199200 A Toronto group, which included Bill Ballard, son of Harold, and Basketball Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain submitted an application and $100,000 USD deposit for a NBA expansion franchise for MLG in 1986, but of the six cities to apply201202 Toronto was not one of the four which were successful.203 It was not until the NBA awarded an expansion franchise to John Bitove, over a group led by future MLSE minority partner Larry Tanenbaum which had partnered with the Maple Leafs,204 and the Toronto Raptors joined the NBA for the 1995&lt;U+2013&gt;96 season that the city would get a NBA team.
Merger with the Raptors and rebranding
In 1997 it was reported that the Maple Leafs were in negotiations to purchase the Toronto Shooting Stars of the National Professional Soccer League.205 The team had been suspended following their inaugural season playing at MLG during which the club lost nearly $1 million and the league was forced to take over operations after only three games when ownership pulled out.206207208 However, the team never returned to play. Following the inaugural season of the Hamilton, Ontario based Ontario Raiders of the National Lacrosse League in 1998, in which they lost $250,000 playing at Copps Coliseum, owner Chris Fritz was forced to look for partners.209 MLSE engaged in negotiations to purchase the team and have it play at MLG.210211212 However, a group which included Bill Watters, the then Assistant General Manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs, ultimately bought the team for $250,000 and promptly moved it to MLG where they rebranded the team the Toronto Rock.213214 MLSE held negotiations with the Arena Football League in 1998 on acquiring a $4&lt;U+2013&gt;7 million USD expansion franchise for the following season to coincide with the opening of the ACC.215216 The company also submitted an application for a Women's National Basketball Association franchise, but was rejected by the league due to concerns about their readiness.217218

Air Canada Centre, home to the Maple Leafs and Raptors since 1999, came under the ownership of MLGL while under construction with the merger of the two franchises

With MLG aging, MLGL began planning for a new home for the Maple Leafs in the 1990s. Following years of acrimonious negotiations with the Toronto Raptors on a shared a new arena, MLGL purchased 100% of the basketball club and the arena they had begun constructing, the Air Canada Centre (ACC), from Allan Slaight and the Bank of Nova Scotia on 12 February 1998.219220 MLGL paid a reported $467 million, made up of $179 million for the team and $288 million for the arena.221222223 Richard Peddie, who had been President of the Toronto Raptors, was retained in the merger and became MLSE's President and CEO.224 That July the company adopted a new name, Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment (MLSE), to reflect its broader holdings.225 MLSE subsequently ordered major modifications to the original design of the ACC, which was basketball-specific, to make it more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217 million, the budget was increased to $265 million after MLSE took control.226 MLG was subsequently sold to Loblaw Companies, Canada's largest food retailer, in 2004 for $12 million under the condition that it not be used as a sports and entertainment facility, though MLSE eventually consented to allowing a small arena to be restored in the building to house Ryerson University's Rams.227228

The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) granted MLSE two category 2 digital specialty channel licenses in 2000 for Leafs TV and Raptors NBA TV, which launched on 7 September 2001. The channels were used by MLSE to broadcast live games involving their teams in an attempt to increase competition for their rights and drive up the fees paid by other broadcasters.229

Ricoh Coliseum after being renovated in 2005 to house MLSE's Toronto Marlies

In August 2004 MLSE announced that they would relocate their AHL farm team from St. John's, Newfoundland to Toronto to play in the Ricoh Coliseum for the 2005&lt;U+2013&gt;06 season,230 after the arena was left without a hockey tenant following the termination of their lease with the Toronto Roadrunners, the AHL affiliate of the Edmonton Oilers, for defaulting on their rent.231232 MLSE agreed to a 20 year lease for the Coliseum,233 which had undergone a $38 million renovation in 2003,234235 that called for rent to cover debt financing charges, property taxes and generate a return to the arena investors,236 which exceeds $4 million annually.237

Condos at Maple Leaf Square built by a partnership including MLSE next to the Air Canada Centre

MLSE announced in April 2005 that they would be working with Cadillac Fairview (a wholly owned subsidiary of Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan) and Lanterra Developments to build Maple Leaf Square, a major entertainment complex situated next to the ACC. The $500 million  complex, which was completed in 2010, is a mixed use facility which features the Hotel St. Germain, e11ven restaurant, Real Sports Apparel, Real Sports Bar and Grill, Longo's grocery store, office space and condominium residences.238239240241 In conjunction with the construction of Maple Leaf Square was a two year, $48 million renovation of the ACC to connect it with the square, which added a new atrium that includes a high-definition broadcast studio for Leafs TV, NBA TV Canada and GolTV Canada. The external wall of the atrium features a 30 by  video screen which often broadcasts games to spectators gathered in the plaza in front of the arena.242

Launch of Toronto FC
MLSE was awarded a Major League Soccer expansion team for Toronto, which would become known as Toronto FC, in 2005 for $10 million USD.243 The company also agreed to contribute $8 million towards the construction of Toronto FC's future home BMO Field, which was to cost $62.9 million total, and purchased the naming rights to the stadium for $10 million for 20 years, which they subsequently resold to the Bank of Montreal for $27 million over the first 10 years.244245246 MLSE also agreed to cover any construction cost overruns.247248 The governments of Canada, Ontario and Toronto contributed $27 million, $8 million and $9.8 million respectively, with the City of Toronto also providing the land.249250251 In return, MLSE got the management rights for the stadium for 20 years.252 Prior to the 2010 MLS season, MLSE spent $3.5 million to convert the stadium from FieldTurf to natural grass,253254 and a further $2 million to expand the north end by 1,400 seats.255256 As part of the deal to convert the field to natural grass, MLSE spent $1.2 million adding a winter bubble to Lamport Stadium and $800,000 building a new artificial turf field to replace the community use hours lost at BMO Field.257
MLSE partnered with Rogers Communications in 2005 to bid to host a regular season National Football League game in Toronto.258259260 On 30 January 2008 it was announced that Rogers and Larry Tanenbaum, chairman of MLSE, had reached an agreement with the Buffalo Bills to host an annual regular-season and three exhibition NFL games over five seasons at Toronto's Rogers Centre beginning in 2008, with the games branded the Bills Toronto Series.261 At the time MLSE was considering bringing a NFL team to Toronto permanently and building them a new stadium, but abandoned the idea when they concluded that the project would not generate sufficient financial return to justify the significant cost of the project.262 Subsequently, MLSE president Tim Leiweke said on a NFL team in Toronto: &quot;We can't own a team (per NFL rules), but we do have more expertise on how to build (stadiums) than anyone ... MLSE can play a role.&quot;263 It has been reported that MLSE is interested in building and managing the proposed NFL stadium,264265 which it has already begun designing.266 In 2013 MLSE minority owner Tanenbaum and board member Edward Rogers III partnered with musician Bon Jovi to purchase an NFL team. Following the death of Bills' owner Ralph Wilson in 2014 the group submitted an offer to purchase the franchise, with speculation that they would move the team to Toronto when their lease permitted it, but were outbid by the Pegulas.267
The company has contemplated purchasing the Argonauts of the CFL at least twice, with minority partner Tanenbaum keen to add the team to his list of franchises, but concluded that the cost and effort that would be required to make the team profitable was not worth the minimal financial upside.268269 In 2013 it was reported that the company was again considering purchasing the team and having them play at a renovated BMO Field.270271272 Current Argos owner David Braley has said that he is having discussions with potential buyers for the team and would like to sell it by his 75th birthday in 2016,273 with the asking price reportedly initially $20 million,274275 but since coming down to $10 million.276 A vote by MLSE's board on purchasing the team was called in December 2013, but they were unable to come to an agreement on the issue, leading to the possibility that Tanenbaum might purchase the team individually.277278 Leiweke has said that &quot;on a stand-alone basis, we have no interest in the Argos. But because of the uniqueness of what we have to go through to get the stadium, we are certainly intertwined. The definition of intertwined is forthcoming.&quot;279 The potential acquisition of the Argos by MLSE is thought to enhance the likelihood of Toronto receiving an NFL franchise,280 with Peddie saying &quot;everything I'm hearing is that that the NFL is telling them that if you want an NFL team, you better make sure the Argos are okay.&quot;281 Leiweke has said that moving into a renovated BMO field &quot;will help turn [the Argos] around&quot; and that &quot;there's no way the NFL comes here without the CFL being unbelievably successful first.&quot;282
When the nearby city of Oshawa built a new arena, known as General Motors Centre, MLSE was chosen to manage the building. However, disappointing results in the first year and a half of operations following the arena's opening in November 2006 led MLSE to request that its contract be terminated in March 2008.283 The company had been attempting to get into the business of managing facilities beyond those where their teams play but decided to withdraw, with Bob Hunter, MLSE's Vice President of venues and entertainment, saying that managing the arena was &quot;no longer a strategic focus for us&quot;.284285
Recent projects

KIA Training Ground built by MLSE in the early 2010s to serve as Toronto FC's practice facility and home to the TFC Academy

In 2008 MLSE launched the TFC Academy youth system to develop soccer players for Toronto FC286 by taking advantage of MLS's new homegrown player rule which allows clubs to retain the rights to players they develop without them being subject to the MLS SuperDraft. The senior academy team originally competed in the Canadian Soccer League until pulling out in early 2013 due to the CSL losing its sanctioning from the Canadian Soccer Association.287288 The team played that year in the Ontario Soccer League before joining League1 Ontario for the 2014 season.289 In November 2014 MLSE announced the establishment of their own minor league professional soccer team to play in the USL Pro, which will serve as a reserve team for TFC and a bridge between the Academy. The team is set to begin play in the Toronto area in 2015.290 In March 2011 Downsview Park was selected as the site of Toronto FC's new state-of-the-art academy and training facility. Construction began on the KIA Training Ground in May 2011, and the facility opened in June 2012. It includes three grass fields, one domed turf field and a field house. MLSE spent more than $21 million building the facility and pays rent for the land,291292 In July 2014 it was announced that MLSE would expand the training grounds to house a practice facility for the Argos, which would rent the facility from MLSE and practice on a nearby city owned field.293294 The team moved in that September.295
Then Raptors President and General Manager Bryan Colangelo said in 2008 that MLSE was considering launching a NBA Development League franchise in the Toronto area within the next couple of years to serve as a developmental team for the Raptors.296 Hamilton's Copps Coliseum as well as Oshawa were reportedly the two cities under consideration to host the franchise.297 In 2014 his replacement, Masai Ujiri, reiterated that the company was interested in purchasing a D-League franchise to play close to Toronto within the next few years.298
It was announced on 23 January 2009 that MLSE would acquire Insight Sports' 80.1% interest in GolTV Canada, a digital cable channel devoted to soccer.299300 In November 2009 MLSE applied to the CRTC for a Category 2 digital TV license for a general interest sports service provisionally named Mainstream Sports,301 which was granted in June 2010.302 MLSE planned to broadcast its teams' games on the channel, along the lines of team-owned regional sports networks in the United States such as YES Network and the New England Sports Network, with the tentative name &quot;Real Sports&quot; (in keeping with the branding of MLSE's sports bar and apparel store).303304305 It was never revealed whether the channel would have replaced, or supplemented, MLSE's existing digital channels. Peddie credited the threat of a Real Sports channel as a motivator for Rogers and Bell, owners of sports channels Sportsnet and TSN respectively, to purchase the company due to concerns about losing the rights to broadcast MLSE teams to the channel or having to pay huge fees for them.306307 The acquisition of MLSE by Rogers and Bell in 2012, and associated agreements to divide the company's regional broadcast rights between the two, eliminated the need for the channel308 and its license expired after the three year deadline for launch passed in 2013.309310
In September 2009 the Maple Leafs and Marlies opened their new hockey practice facility, the MasterCard Centre.311 The arena was a joint venture between MLSE, the City of Toronto and the Lakeshore Lions Club to replace the nearby Lakeshore Lions Arena,312 and was built at a cost of $44 million, after cost overruns drove up the cost from $33.65 million.313314315 The Lions Club contributed $40 million to the project, with the city providing a $35.5 million loan guarantee.316317318319 The Toronto District School Board leased the land for the arena to the Lakeshore Lions for a 50 year term.320 MLSE spent a further $5 million on training and medical facilities,321322 and pays $600,000 annually to rent the building.323324 The arena was originally operated by the Lakeshore Lions Club,325 but in June 2011, with the arena on the verge of defaulting on its rising debt, the City of Toronto took control and assumed its $43.4 million debt326327328329330 with the intention to return it to private management within 2&lt;U+2013&gt;3 years.331332333334335 A city councillor has suggested that MLSE, which operates BMO Field and Ricoh Coliseum on behalf of the city, would be &quot;the logical party&quot; to take over the arena, and a spokesperson for the company said &quot;while we don't have any interest in purchasing the facility, we are open to discussing the possibility of managing the facility on behalf of the City&quot;.336 MLSE's executive vice president of venues and entertainment Bob Hunter confirmed that they would bid for the right to run the building.337
At one point MLSE contemplated purchasing the Toronto Blue Jays of MLB and Sportsnet from Rogers Communications, but concerns about the viability of SkyDome as a baseball venue and the profitability of the team resulted in the company not pursuing either.338 The company also considered investing in an English soccer club,339340 and on 29 May 2012, after the Leeds United Supporters Trust put out a request for a takeover from majority shareholder Ken Bates, it was reported that MLSE were in talks to buy the team. However, the company later denied that it planned to purchase the club.341
Peddie retired as President and CEO of MLSE at the end of 2011 after fourteen years on the job,342343 having tripled the value of the company.344 However, he was often criticized for his inability to end the company's long championship drought.345 Of the three major franchises the company currently owns (Maple Leafs, Raptors and Toronto FC), only the Maple Leafs have ever won a championship, and not since their 1967 Stanley Cup. The only other major championship MLSE has won was the 74th Grey Cup in 1986 by the Tiger-Cats. Though Tom Anselmi briefly took over as President,346 he was replaced in June 2013 by high profile executive Tim Leiweke who had previously run Anschutz Entertainment Group.347 On 21 August 2014 Leiweke announced that he was stepping down, but would remain in his position until 30 June 2015 or until a successor is appointed.348

Proposed projects
BMO Field renovation

 The financial success of Toronto FC led MLSE to undertake a $105 million renovation to BMO Field.349 Under a two phase process, the stadium's capacity will be increased from 21,566 to 30,000 by 1 May 2015 for $65 million, and a canopy roof covering most permanent seating areas added by 1 May 2016 for $40 million.350351
The City of Toronto, which owns the facility, originally insisted that any renovations allow for the Argonauts, who must vacate their current home Rogers Centre by the end of 2017 season, to move in.352353354355 The original plans called for retractable endzone seating so that the pitch can be lengthened to fit a Canadian football field with 25,000 seats, and the possibility to temporarily expand capacity to 40,000 for big events356 such as rugby sevens at the 2015 Pan-Am games, the 2018 NHL Winter Classic, Grey Cups, MLS Cups or a successful 2026 FIFA World Cup bid by Canada.357358359360361362
MLSE sought $10 million in funding from each of the City, Provincial Government, and Federal Government to top up their $90 million contribution, plus any cost overruns, to the project.363364365366367 In return, they will pay annual rent to the City for the upgraded stadium,368369 while their management and naming rights agreements for the stadium, which were set to expire in 2027, were extended by 10 years.370371 The Toronto City Council approved the project in June 2014.372 However, with deadlines approaching to start construction to ensure that the stadium would be ready for the 2015 Pan-Am games, and no funding commitments from either the federal or provincial governments, MLSE decided to move forward with the first phase of renovations without securing the remaining $20 million in funding.373374 Lengthening of the field and the infrastructure to allow for temporarily increasing seating capacity was postponed to a third phase costing $20&lt;U+2013&gt;25 million to be completed by 1 May 2017, pending the $20 million funding gap being filled.375376377378379 The official groundbreaking took place on September 23.380381
Raptors practice facility
In November 2013 it was reported that MLSE had contracted an architect to design a new practice facility for the Raptors.382 The team has trained on a practice court located in the ACC since its opening in 1999, and a new facility would allow this space to be repurposed into a restaurant or nightclub.383384 The facility, which is planned to be built at Exhibition Place,385 will feature two courts, one of which will be open to the public.386387 Canada Basketball will also use the facility.388389 MLSE will pay the entire $30 million construction cost and lease the property from the city for $205,000 annually, subject to reassessments for inflation, for a 20 year term, with two options to extend it by a further 10 years, following which the city would take ownership of the building.390391 MLSE has requested that the city exempt the portion of the facility that is available to the public (32%) from city taxes.392393 Construction is scheduled to begin in November 2014,394395 to have the facility completed in time for the team's hosting of the NBA All-Star Game in February 2016.396397 The proposal was approved by the Board of Governors of Exhibition Place on August 14,398 the Executive Committee of the City of Toronto on August 20,399400 and the Toronto City Council on August 25.401402403
Ownership
Conn Smythe

Conn Smythe, founder of Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment

Although Conn Smythe was the face of MLGL from its founding in 1931, he did not acquire majority ownership of the company until 1947, following a power struggle between directors who supported him as president and those who wanted him replaced with Frank J. Selke. With the help of a $300,000 loan from Toronto stockbroker and MLGL shareholder Percy Gardiner, and the support of minority partner Jack Bickell, Smythe was able to buy 30,000 shares in MLGL from Gardiner404 and installed himself as president on 19 November 1947, replacing Edward Bickle.405406407 The loan was paid off in 1960.408 In November 1961 Smythe sold 45,000 of his 50,000 shares to a three-person partnership formed by Stafford Smythe (Conn Smythe's son), Harold Ballard and John Bassett, who at the time owned part of the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League and Toronto Telegram, for $2.3 million. When combined with their own holdings, this gave them 87,000 shares representing 60% of the company.409410411412413 Ballard fronted Stafford most of the money for the purchase though a loan he obtained.414415 According to several sources, Conn thought the sale was only to his son,416 and was furious when he learned that Ballard and Bassett were his partners. He had hoped that Stafford would keep MLGL for his son, Tommy.417 However, it is unlikely that Stafford could have raised the millions needed for the deal on his own. Stafford became president of MLGL and governor of the Maple Leafs, with Ballard executive vice president and Bassett chairman of the board.418
Harold Ballard, John Bassett and Stafford Smythe
In March 1966 Conn sold his remaining shares and resigned from the board of directors after a Muhammad Ali boxing match was scheduled for MLG. He found Ali's refusal to serve in the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War to be offensive,419 and said that by accepting the fight, MLGL owners had &quot;put cash ahead of class.&quot;420 Within three years under the new owners, profits at MLGL had tripled to just under $1 million. Ballard negotiated lucrative deals to place advertising throughout the building, and greatly increased the number of seats in the arena.421
Following a Royal Canadian Mounted Police raid at MLG in 1968, Stafford was charged with income tax evasion, and he and Ballard were accused of illegally taking money from MLGL to pay for renovations of their houses and other personal expenses. Just before the charges were laid, Bassett argued to the board that Stafford and Ballard should be removed from their posts. Following an 8&lt;U+2013&gt;7 vote of the board of directors on 26 June 1969, Stafford and Ballard were both fired, and Bassett was appointed president of MLGL. However, Bassett did not force Stafford and Ballard to sell their shares, and both men remained on the board. This proved to be a serious strategic blunder; Stafford was the largest single shareholder in MLGL, and he and Ballard controlled almost half the company's stock between them. They were thus able to regain control of the board in 1970 and Stafford was once again appointed president.422 Facing an untenable situation, Bassett sold the 196,200 shares he controlled in MLGL to Stafford and Ballard in September 1971 for $5.4 million, which he used to buy out his partners in the Argos.423424425 Combined with their 306,295 jointly controlled shares, the transaction gave the Stafford Smythe-Ballard partnership 78% of the stock.426427 Ballard would be convicted of 47 charges428 and sentenced to three years in a federal penitentiary, but Stafford died in October 1971 of a bleeding ulcer at the age of only 50 just before his trial was scheduled to begin.429430431 Under the terms of Stafford's will, of which Ballard was an executor,432 each partner was allowed to buy the other's shares upon their death. Stafford's brother and son tried to keep the shares within the family,433 but in February 1972 Ballard bought all 251,545 of Stafford's shares for $7.5 million, valuing the company at $22 million.434435436437438 Stafford's brother Hugh also sold his shares to Ballard, ending the Smythe family's 45-year involvement in the company. Combined with Ballard's 262,162 shares, this gave him majority ownership of about 70%.439440441
Harold Ballard
In 1966 Ballard set up a family holding company, named Harold E. Ballard Ltd. (HEBL), for his assets including his shares in MLGL as part of an estate freeze.442443 Ballard distributed 103 common shares in HEBL, with his three children, Bill, Harold Jr., and Mary Elizabeth, each receiving 34 which were held in trust, and his wife Dorothy receiving 1, which Harold would inherit upon her death three years later.444445446447 Harold retained 308,000 preferred shares in HEBL.448449 While the equity of the company was vested in the common stock, both common and preferred shares each received a single vote, ensuring that Harold retained control of the company.450
After getting into financial difficulty, Harold reached an agreement with Molson Brewery in November 1980, which at the time owned the Montreal Canadiens, for the company to cover his debt financing charges on a loan of $8.8 million for 10 years in exchange for an option to purchase a 19.9% block of shares in MLGL from HEBL and a right of first refusal on the rest of HEBL's shares.451452453 The NHL did not learn of the deal until the late 1980s.454 In 1982 he offered to sell the company for $50 million, with the arena alone reportedly valued at $11 million, though a stockholders' report the following year placed the value of MLGL at $23.5 million.455456 When Harold transferred ownership of his personal real estate holdings, which were valued at $2.52 million, to HEBL in January 1989, he acquired 4 newly issued common shares in the company plus a promise of a further $896,472 rather than cash.457458459 Mary Elizabeth sold her stake in HEBL to her father for $15.5 million in January 1989,460461 after originally having a deal to sell the stake to Don Giffin,462 while Harold Jr. sold his back to HEBL for $21 million in June of the same year.463464465466 Harold secured a loan from Molson for the full amount of his buyout of Mary Elizabeth, using the 34 acquired shares in HEBL as security.467 Harold Jr.'s shares were subsequently retired.468 Bill sued his father for $170 million over HEBL's acquisition of Harold Jr.'s stake,469470 claiming that he and partner Michael Cohl had acquired a right of first refusal to purchase the shares for $20 million that February.471472 Shortly thereafter, HEBL issued Harold 32 common shares and $125,216 in exchange for ownership of his 350,200 personally held MLGL shares and $125,000.473474 Two more new common shares would be granted to Harold to repay the $911,000 debt HEBL owed him from his two transactions with the company.475 This gave Harold, who feared that Bill was positioning himself to take over the holding company, control of HEBL.476 Harold did not want his bickering children to inherit MLGL because he feared they would destroy it.477
Though Harold ran up significant amounts of personal debt during his ownership of MLGL, he made the company very profitable, so much so that MLG became known as the &quot;Cashbox on Carlton Street&quot;, referring to the address of the arena.478 Upon Harold's death in April 1990,479480 most of his estate, which was worth less than $50 million, was left to charitable organizations.481 The executors of Harold's will were supermarket tycoon Steve Stavro, Giffin and Donald Crump. In November 1990 Molson exercised their option on 19.9% of the company, paying $10,000 for 735,575 of HEBL's MLGL shares, which at the time were valued at $20 million.482 Due to restrictions against cross-ownership in the NHL, the company set up a trust to hold their stake,483484485 and the league instructed them to sell the shares within an &quot;adequate amount of time&quot;.486487488 Shortly after the estate, which had limited income due to HEBL still owing TD Bank $15.8 million on its loan to acquire Harold Jr's HEBL stock, missed a January 1991 deadline to repay its $20 million loan (including interest) from Molson,489490 Stavro personally loaned the estate the funds to pay off the debt.491492493 In exchange he received an option to purchase the estate's HEBL shares before January 1996.494495496497498 Bill challenged the transaction, but it was approved by the court.499 In early 1991 Molson offered to buy the estate's shares for $40 each.500 In September 1991 Bill sold his HEBL stock to his father's estate for $21 million, giving it ownership of the entire company.501 Shortly thereafter it was announced that Stavro had reached a deal with Molson on an option to purchase their MLGL shares until April 1994 and for Molson to waive their option on the estate's shares.502503
Steve Stavro












Stavro founded MLG Ventures (MLGV) in March 1994 with partners Toronto-Dominion Bank and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.504505506 MLG Holdings Ltd. (MLGH), of which Stavro owned 80% and TD Bank controlled the remaining 20%, held a 51% ownership stake in MLGV, with the remaining 49% owned by Teachers'.507508509 The following month MLGV announced that they had reached an agreement to purchase the 60.3% of MLGL held by Harold's estate for $34 a share or $75 million total, valuing the company at $125 million.510511512513514515 The estate still owned Stavro $23 million at the time.516 Molson also sold its 19.9% of MLGL to MLGV in April 1994 for $25 million.517518519520521 Larry Tanenbaum's company Kilmer Sports purchased a 25% share of MLGH from Stavro in 1996 for a reported $21 million.522523524525526
MLGV subsequently purchased all the remaining shares and took MLGL private in 1998, after acquiring more than the 90% of stock necessary to force objecting shareholders out,527528529 and MLGL and MLGV amalgamated.530531 The purchase was the subject of a Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) review, due to allegations that MLGV had engaged in insider trading by failing to disclose that broadcast revenue was expected to substantially increase,532533534535536537538 and a $50 million lawsuit from Bill who claimed that Stavro and others devalued MLGL and withheld information relevant to the value of the company prior to the sale of his stock.539 Ontario's Office of the Public Trustee, which was charged with representing the charities named by Harold's will as beneficiaries, argued that Stavro had a conflict of interest as both executor of the will and buyer and had not paid market value because there was no public bidding process for the shares.540541542543544 Several minority owners, including Harry Ornest, who held 3.5% of the company, and Jim Devellano also objected to MLGV's attempts to take the company private without an auction.545546547 Stavro and his partners in MLGV reached a settlement in 1996 to pay an additional $23.5 million plus interest to the charities as well as $2.5 million to the minority shareholders who had sued,548549550551552 clearing the way for them to become the majority owner of MLGL. They also settled with the OSC in 1999 for $1.6 million, which included a fine and costs.553554555 Teachers' invested $44.3 million and TD $9.75 million in the deal.556557
Following the merger, the ownership structure of the now defunct MLGV was retained by MLGL. MLGH was the majority owner of MLGL, holding 51% of the company. It in turn was controlled by Stavro (55%), with minority shareholders Tanenbaum (25%) and TD Capital Group (20%).558559560 The remaining 49% of MLGL was owned by Teachers'.561562563564 This tiered ownership structure gave Stavro effective control of MLGL with only a net 29% stake of the company.565 Teachers' invested a further $50 million in the company in the form of a convertible bond in 1998 to finance the purchase of the Raptors and ACC and complete construction of the arena.566567
Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan
In 2003 an agreement was reached to restructure the company with Stavro selling his stake to Bell Globemedia for a reported $120&lt;U+2013&gt;150-million after debt repayments,568 the other partners converting their debts into equity, and each partner getting a direct ownership stake in the newly named MLSE, with MLGH being dissolved.569570571 This left Teachers' as the controlling majority owners of MLSE with 58.4%, and minority partners Bell Globemedia (15.4%), TD Capital with (13.5%) and Tanenbaum, who took over as non-executive chairman, with 13%.572573574575 Each owner of MLSE had a right of first refusal on any shares sold, in proportion to their ownership share.576577 The same year MLSE was internally valued at over $1 billion by Teachers' in its annual report. In 2008 the Toronto Star reported that a valuation commissioned by the company concluded that the company was worth $1.5 billion USD.578 On 5 December 2008 CTVglobemedia (the renamed Bell Globemedia) sold half of its 15.4% stake to Tanenbaum for $100 million, making Tanenbaum the second-largest stakeholder with 20.7%.579580 The transaction valued the company at $1.2 billion. On 20 August 2009 Teachers' announced that it had agreed to purchase the remaining 7.7% stake in MLSE owned by CTVglobemedia, bumping their stake to 66%.581582583
Bell and Rogers
In December 2010 it was reported that Rogers Communications, owner of the Toronto Blue Jays, was in negotiations to purchase the Teachers' 66% stake in MLSE, with the asking price set at $1.3 billion,584585 and in March 2011 Teachers' confirmed that their share in the company was for up for sale.586587 Tanenbaum's right of first refusal on the shares gave him control over any sale by Teachers'.588589 In May 2011 Teachers' announced that they had reached an agreement to purchase TD Capital's 13.5% ownership share, giving them 79.5% of the company and leaving Tanenbaum as the only minority partner with 20.5%, simplifying a sale of their shares.590591 In November 2011 Teachers' announced that they were taking the company off the market.592 However, only a couple of weeks later, on 9 December 2011, Teachers' announced the sale of its entire stake in MLSE to a partnership between Bell Canada and Rogers Communications, in a deal valued at $1.32 billion,593594 giving the company an equity value of $1.66 billion and an enterprise value of $2 billion.595596 As part of the deal, Tanenbaum increased his stake in the company to 25%.597598599 The deal required the approval of Canada's Competition Bureau, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (with regards to MLSE's TV channels), as well as the NHL, the AHL, the NBA, and MLS (with regards to each of MLSE's main sports franchises).
The Competition Bureau announced in May 2012 that it would not challenge the transaction, but that it will &quot;actively review&quot; the situation in light of &quot;serious concerns&quot; expressed by various parties, reserving the right to take action at a later date.600 The NHL Board of Governors approved the sale at a meeting in Las Vegas on 19 June 2012.601 The final approval, that of the CRTC, was granted on 16 August, with the commission noting that it only had jurisdiction over the TV channels owned by MLSE (the transfer of ownership of which, it decided, posed no major concerns), and not the broadcast rights associated with MLSE's teams.602 The transaction closed on 22 August 2012.603










As part of the sale, two numbered companies were created to jointly hold stock. Following the restructuring, the ownership hierarchy of MLSE was:604

8047286 Canada Inc. (Rogers/Bell joint holding company) &lt;U+2013&gt; 75%

Rogers Communications – 50% (net ownership 37.5%)
7680147 Canada Inc. (Bell holding company) – 50%

Bell Canada Enterprises – 74.67% (net ownership 28%)
BCE Master Trust Fund (investment fund of Bell's pension plan) – 25.33% (net ownership 9.5%)605


Kilmer Sports (holding company of Larry Tanenbaum) – 25%

This ownership structure ensures that, at the shareholder level, Rogers and Bell vote their overall 75% interest in the company together and thus decisions on the management of the company must be made by consensus of the two. (If Rogers and Bell owned their interests directly, either Rogers or Bell could be overruled by its competitor in combination with Tanenbaum.) As such, Rogers and Bell have agreed that their previously four of six (now six of eight) directors on the MLSE board will always vote together, and thus that any disagreements between the two companies will be settled privately without the involvement of Tanenbaum.606607 Bell has indicated that the involvement of Bell's pension fund is, at least in part, intended to ensure Bell can retain its existing 18% interest in the Montreal Canadiens, as NHL rules prevent any shareholder that owns more than 30% of a team from holding an ownership position in any other team.608
