 The Tin [or Teen] Bigha Corridor () is a strip of land belonging to India on the West Bengal&lt;U+2013&gt;Bangladesh border, which in September, 2011, was leased to Bangladesh so that it can access its Dahagram&lt;U+2013&gt;Angarpota enclaves. 1
Facts
According to the Indira Gandhi-Sheikh Mujibur Rahman treaty of 1974, India and Bangladesh were to hand over the sovereignty of the Tin Bigha Corridor (178 x 85 sq m) and South Berubari (7.39 sq km) to each other, thereby allowing access to the Dahagram&lt;U+2013&gt;Angarpota enclaves and the Indian enclaves adjacent to South Berubari. Bangladesh did hand over the sovereignty of the larger South Berubari to India instantly in 1974. India, however, refused to transfer the much smaller Tin Bigha Corridor to Bangladesh. 23
After much Bangladesh government protest, India, instead of handing over sovereignty in 2011, proposed to lease the Tin Bigha Corridor to Bangladesh for a certain time. South Berubari, meanwhile, would remain in the possession of India.
Etymology
Tin is the word for the numeral &quot;three&quot; in Bengali, and bigha is a unit of area ranging from 1,500 to 6,771 sq m.
Access to corridor
The corridor was previously open for 12 daylight hours only,45 causing great hardships for the inhabitants of the enclave, given the fact that the enclave has no hospitals or law enforcement facilities.6
Following a treaty signed by the Prime Ministers of India and Bangladesh on September 6, 2011 in Dhaka, it was agreed that the corridor would be open for 24 hours for Bangladeshis in the enclave to access the mainland.78
The corridor was officially declared open by the Bangladesh Premier Sheikh Hasina on October 19, 2011.9
Infrastructure
Until recently, the enclaves had no hospitals10 or colleges. Bangladesh Premier Sheikh Hasina inaugurated a ten-bed Dahagram Hospital and the Dahagram Union Parishad Complex on October 19th.11
