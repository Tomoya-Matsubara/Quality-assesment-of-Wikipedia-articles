La Ci&lt;U+00E9&gt;naga is an Argentine, Spanish, and French film released in 2001, directed by Lucrecia Martel.1
The film was executive produced by Ana Aizenberg, Diego Guebel, Mario Pergolini, and produced by Lita Stantic. The screenplay was written by Lucrecia Martel. It's also known in English as: The Swamp.
Plot

The picture is set in the high plains of northwestern Argentina and portrays the life of a self-pitying Argentine bourgeois family.
The film tells the story of Mecha (Graciela Borges), a middle aged woman in her 50's who has several teenagers. Her husband Gregorio (Martin Adejmian) wants to remain looking young. Both have to deal with their gloomy Amerindian servants, who Mecha accuses of theft and laziness.
Both take to drinking to cope with day to day living. The family spends their summers in their rural shabby country home they name &quot;La Mandragora&quot; in order to avoid the hot and humid weather of the city.
Mecha's cousin, Tali (Mercedes Mor&lt;U+00E1&gt;n), lives in the nearby city of La Ci&lt;U+00E9&gt;naga (The Swamp, in English) and has a brood of small, yet, noisy children and a husband, Rafael (Daniel Valenzuela), who loves his family and also hunts.
Before long, the crowded domestic situation in both homes strains the families' nerves, exposing repressed family mysteries, and tensions that threaten to erupt into violence. 
Background
The screenplay of the film was written by director Lucrecia Martel. She has said in interviews that the story is based on &quot;memories of her own family.&quot;2

The film was also shown at various film festivals, including: the Karlovy Vary Film Festival; the Toronto Film Festival; the New York Film Festival; the Warsaw Film Festival; International Film Festival, Rotterdam; the Titanic International Filmpresence Festival, Hungary; the Adelaide International Film Festival; the Uruguay International Film Festival; and the Havana Film Festival, Cuba.

Critical reception
The film was well received by film critics and was widely seen in many film festivals. Writing for the New York Times, critic Stephen Holden liked Lucrecia Martel's debut film, and called it &quot;remarkable.&quot; He said, &quot;The steamy ambience in which the characters fester is a metaphor for creeping social decay...La Ci&lt;U+00E9&gt;naga perspires from the screen, it creates a vision of social malaise that feels paradoxically familiar and new.&quot;3
Critic David Lipfert also liked the director's various sociological messages and metaphors contained in the film. He believes the &quot;New Argentina Cinema&quot; is moving beyond the themes related to the military dictatorship period of the late 1970s and early 1980s. He said, &quot;[Martel's] intense, in-your-face portrait of a dissolute middle class lacks the usual justifying criminal context. Martel simply holds up a mirror to Argentinean society, and the result is devastating. Instead of creating an allegory with archetypes, she shows characters that are all too real. When still, her camera is low and close as though we were right on top of the actors.&quot;4
When the film opened in New York, film critic for the Village Voice Amy Taubin said, &quot;Lucrecia Martel's La Ci&lt;U+00E9&gt;naga is a veritable Chekhov tragicomedy of provincial life. Making a brilliant debut, Martel constructs her narrative from quotidian incidents, myriad comings and goings, and a cacophony of voices competing for attention...[i]n a debut feature that's assured in every aspect, Martel's direction of the younger members of her cast is particularly notable.&quot;5
