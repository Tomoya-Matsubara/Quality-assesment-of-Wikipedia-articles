John Sidney McCain III (born August 29, 1936) is the senior United States Senator from Arizona and presumptive Republican Party nominee for President of the United States in the 2008 election.
McCain graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958 and became a naval aviator, flying ground-attack aircraft from aircraft carriers. During the Vietnam War, he nearly lost his life in the 1967 USS Forrestal fire. Later that year while on a bombing mission over North Vietnam, he was shot down, badly injured, and captured as a prisoner of war by the North Vietnamese. He was held from 1967 to 1973, experiencing episodes of torture and refusing an out-of-sequence early repatriation offer; his war wounds would leave him with lifelong physical limitations.
He retired from the Navy as a captain in 1981 and, moving to Arizona, entered politics. Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982, he served two terms, and was then elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986, winning re-election easily in 1992, 1998, and 2004. While generally adhering to conservative principles, McCain has gained a media reputation as a &quot;maverick&quot; for disagreeing with his party on several key issues. After being investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as a member of the &quot;Keating Five&quot;, he made campaign finance reform one of his signature concerns, which eventually led to the passage of the McCain-Feingold Act in 2002. He is also known for his work towards restoring diplomatic relations with Vietnam in the 1990s, and for his belief that the war in Iraq should be fought to a successful conclusion in the 2000s. McCain has chaired the powerful Senate Commerce Committee, and has been a leader in seeking to rein in both pork barrel spending as well as Senate filibusters of judicial nominations.
McCain lost the Republican nomination in the 2000 presidential election to George W. Bush. He ran again for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, and gained enough delegates to become the party's presumptive nominee in March 2008.
Early life and military career, 1936–1981

Formative years and education
John McCain was born at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone to naval officer John S. McCain, Jr. (1911&lt;U+2013&gt;1981) and Roberta (Wright) McCain (b. 1912).1 At that time, the Panama Canal was under American control.
McCain has Scots-Irish and English ancestry.2 His father and paternal grandfather both became four-star United States Navy admirals.3 His family, including his older sister Sandy and younger brother Joe,4 followed his father to various naval postings in the United States and the Pacific.5 Altogether, he attended about 20 schools.6
In 1951, his family settled in Northern Virginia, and McCain attended Episcopal High School, a private preparatory boarding school in Alexandria.7 In high school, he excelled at wrestling and graduated in 1954.8
Following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, McCain entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. There, he was a friend and leader for many of his classmates,9 and sometimes stood up for people who were being bullied.10 He also became a lightweight boxer.1112 McCain came into conflict with higher-ranking personnel, he did not always obey the rules, and that contributed to a low class rank (894 of 899) which he did not aim to improve.131415 He did well in academic subjects that interested him, such as literature and history, but studied only enough to pass subjects he disliked, such as math.16 McCain graduated in 1958.17
Naval training, first marriage, and Vietnam assignment
McCain's pre-combat duty began when he was commissioned an ensign, and started two and a half years of training as a naval aviator at Pensacola.18 There he also earned a reputation as a partying man.19 Graduating from flight school in 1960, he became a naval pilot of ground-attack aircraft. McCain was then stationed in A-1 Skyraider squadrons,20 on the aircraft carriers USS Intrepid and USS Enterprise,21 in the Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas.22 The planes he was flying crashed twice and once collided with power lines, but he received no major injuries.23
On July 3, 1965, McCain married Carol Shepp, a model originally from Philadelphia.24 McCain adopted her two young children Douglas and Andrew.2526 He and Carol then had a daughter named Sidney.2728
McCain requested a combat assignment,29 and was assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal flying A-4 Skyhawks.30 His combat duty began when he was 30 years old, in summer 1967, when Forrestal was assigned to a bombing campaign during the Vietnam War.3132 McCain and his fellow pilots became frustrated by micromanagement from Washington, and he would later write that &quot;In all candor, we thought our civilian commanders were complete idiots who didn't have the least notion of what it took to win the war.&quot;3334
By then a lieutenant commander, McCain was almost killed on July 29, 1967, when he was near the center of the Forrestal fire. He escaped from his burning jet and was trying to help another pilot escape when a bomb exploded;35 McCain was struck in the legs and chest by fragments.36 The ensuing fire killed 134 sailors and took 24 hours to control.3738 With the Forrestal out of commission, McCain volunteered for assignment with the USS Oriskany.39
Prisoner of war
John McCain's capture and imprisonment began on October 26, 1967. He was flying his 23rd bombing mission over North Vietnam, when his A-4E Skyhawk was shot down by a missile over Hanoi.4041 McCain fractured both arms and a leg, and then nearly drowned, when he parachuted into Truc Bach Lake in Hanoi.42 After he regained consciousness, a crowd attacked him, crushed his shoulder with a rifle butt, and bayoneted him.43 Lieutenant Commander McCain was then transported to Hanoi's main Hoa Lo Prison, nicknamed the &quot;Hanoi Hilton&quot;.44
Although McCain was badly wounded, his captors refused to treat his injuries, instead beating and interrogating him to get information, and he was given medical care only when the North Vietnamese discovered that his father was a top admiral.45 His status as a prisoner of war (POW) made the front pages of major newspapers.4647
McCain spent six weeks in the hospital while receiving marginal care.48 Now having lost , in a chest cast, and with his hair turned white,49 McCain was sent to a different camp on the outskirts of Hanoi50 in December 1967, into a cell with two other Americans who did not expect him to live a week.51 In March 1968, McCain was put into solitary confinement, where he would remain for two years.52
In mid&lt;U+2013&gt;1968, McCain's father was named commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater, and McCain was offered early release.53 The North Vietnamese made that offer because they wanted to appear merciful for propaganda purposes,54 and also wanted to show other POWs that elites like McCain were willing to be treated preferentially.55 McCain turned down the offer of repatriation; he would only accept the offer if every man taken in before him was released as well.56
In August 1968, a program of severe torture began on McCain.57 He was subjected to rope bindings and repeated beatings every two hours, at the same time as he was suffering from dysentery.5859 Further injuries led to the beginning of a suicide attempt, which was stopped by guards.60 After four days, McCain made an anti-American propaganda &quot;confession&quot;.61 He has always felt that his statement was dishonorable, but as he would later write, &quot;I had learned what we all learned over there: Every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine.&quot;6263 His injuries left him permanently incapable of raising his arms above his head.64 He subsequently received two to three beatings per week because of his continued refusal to sign additional statements.65 Other American POWs were similarly tortured and maltreated in order to extract &quot;confessions&quot; and propaganda statements.66
McCain refused to meet with various anti-war groups seeking peace in Hanoi, wanting to give neither them nor the North Vietnamese a propaganda victory.67 From late 1969 onward, treatment of McCain and many of the other POWs became more tolerable,68 while McCain continued to be an active resister against the camp authorities.69 McCain and other prisoners cheered the B-52 Stratofortress-led U.S. &quot;Christmas Bombing&quot; campaign of December 1972, which they viewed as a forceful measure to push North Vietnam to terms.7071
Altogether, McCain was held as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for five and a half years. He was finally released from captivity on March 14, 1973.72
Commanding officer, liaison to Senate, and second marriage
McCain's return to the United States reunited him with his family. His wife Carol had suffered her own crippling ordeal during his captivity, due to an automobile accident in December 1969.73 Her husband became a celebrity of sorts, as a returned POW.74
McCain underwent treatment for his injuries, including months of grueling physical therapy,75 and attended the National War College at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. during 1973&lt;U+2013&gt;1974.76 Having been rehabilitated, by late 1974, McCain had his flight status reinstated, and in 1976 he became commanding officer of a training squadron stationed in Florida.7778 He turned around an undistinguished unit and won the squadron its first Meritorious Unit Commendation.79 During this period in Florida, McCain had extramarital affairs, and the McCains' marriage began to falter, for which he later would accept blame.8081
McCain served as the Navy's liaison to the U.S. Senate beginning in 1977.82 In retrospect, he has said that this represented his &quot;real entry into the world of politics and the beginning of my second career as a public servant&quot;.83 His key behind-the-scenes role gained congressional financing for a new supercarrier against the wishes of the Carter administration.8485
In April 1979,86 McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley, a teacher from Phoenix, Arizona, whose father had founded a large beer distributorship.87 They began dating, and he urged his wife Carol to grant him a divorce, which she did in February 1980, with their uncontested divorce taking effect in April 1980.8889 The settlement included two houses, and financial support for her ongoing medical treatments due to the injuries resulting from her 1969 car accident; they would remain on good terms.90 McCain and Hensley were married on May 17, 1980, with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart attending.9192 However, McCain&lt;U+2019&gt;s children did not attend, and several years would go by before they reconciled.9394 John and Cindy McCain entered into a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name; they would always keep their finances apart and file separate income tax returns.95
McCain decided to leave the Navy. He was unlikely ever to be promoted to the rank of full admiral, as he had poor annual physicals and had been given no major sea command.96 In early 1981, he was reportedly told that he would be promoted to rear admiral but declined the prospect, as he had already made plans to run for Congress and said he could &quot;do more good there.&quot;97 McCain retired from the Navy on April 1, 198198 as a captain.99 He was designated as disabled and awarded a disability pension.100 Upon leaving the military, he moved to Arizona. His 17 military awards and decorations include the Silver Star, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross, Bronze Star and Navy Commendation Medal, for actions before, during, and after his time as a POW.101
House and Senate career, 1982–2000


U.S. Congressman and a growing family
McCain set his sights on becoming a Congressman because he was interested in current events, was ready for a new challenge, and had developed political ambitions during his time as Senate liaison.102103104 Living in Phoenix, he went to work for Hensley &amp; Co., his new father-in-law Jim Hensley's large Anheuser-Busch beer distributorship.105 As Vice President of Public Relations at the distributorship, he gained political support among the local business community, meeting powerful figures such as banker Charles Keating, Jr., real estate developer Fife Symington III and newspaper publisher Darrow &quot;Duke&quot; Tully.106107 In 1982, McCain ran as a Republican for an open seat in Arizona's 1st congressional district.108 A newcomer to the state, McCain was hit with repeated charges of being a carpetbagger.109 McCain responded to a voter making that charge with what a Phoenix Gazette columnist would later describe as &quot;the most devastating response to a potentially troublesome political issue I've ever heard&quot;:110

With the assistance of local political endorsements, his Washington connections, as well as money that his wife lent to his campaign,111 McCain won a highly contested primary election.112 He then easily won the general election in the heavily Republican district.113
In 1983, McCain was elected to lead the incoming group of Republican representatives.114 Also that year, he opposed creation of a federal Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, but admitted in 2008: &quot;I was wrong and eventually realized that, in time to give full support [in 1990] for a state holiday in Arizona.&quot;115116
McCain's politics at this point were mainly in line with President Ronald Reagan, and he was active on Indian Affairs bills.117 He won re-election to the House easily in 1984.118
In 1984 McCain and his wife Cindy had their first child together, daughter Meghan. She was followed two years later by son John Sidney McCain IV (known as &quot;Jack&quot;), and in 1988 by son James.119 In 1991, Cindy McCain brought an abandoned three-month old girl needing medical treatment to the U.S. from a Bangladeshi orphanage run by Mother Teresa.120 The McCains decided to adopt her, and named her Bridget.121
First two terms in U.S. Senate
McCain's Senate career began in January 1987, after he defeated his Democratic opponent, former state legislator Richard Kimball, by 20 percentage points in the 1986 election.122123 McCain succeeded longtime American conservative icon and Arizona fixture Barry Goldwater upon the latter's retirement as United States Senator from Arizona.124
Senator McCain became a member of the Armed Services Committee, with which he had formerly done his Navy liaison work; he also joined the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee.125 McCain continued to support the Native American agenda.126 As first a House member and then a senator, McCain was one of the main authors of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act,127128 which codified rules regarding Native American gambling enterprises and established a balance between tribal sovereignty and state regulatory oversight over such enterprises.129 McCain was also a strong supporter of the Gramm-Rudman legislation that enforced automatic spending cuts in the case of budget deficits.130
McCain soon gained national visibility. He delivered a well-received speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention, was mentioned by the press as a short list vice-presidential running mate for Republican nominee George H. W. Bush, and was named chairman of Veterans for Bush.131132
McCain became enmeshed in a scandal during the 1980s as one of five United States Senators comprising the so-called &quot;Keating Five&quot;.133 Between 1982 and 1987, McCain had received $112,000 in lawful134 political contributions from Charles Keating Jr. and his associates at Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, along with trips on Keating's jets135 that McCain belatedly repaid two years later.136 In 1987, McCain was one of the five senators whom Keating contacted in order to prevent the government's seizure of Lincoln, and McCain met twice with federal regulators to discuss the government's investigation of Lincoln.137 On his Keating Five experience, McCain has said: &quot;The appearance of it was wrong. It's a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators, because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence. And it was the wrong thing to do.&quot;138 In the end, McCain was cleared by the Senate Ethics Committee of acting improperly or violating any law or Senate rule, but was mildly rebuked for exercising &quot;poor judgment&quot;.139140 In his 1992 re-election bid, the Keating Five affair was not a major issue,141 and he won handily, gaining 56 percent of the vote to defeat Democratic community and civil rights activist Claire Sargent and independent former Governor Evan Mecham.142
 McCain developed a reputation for independence, during the 1990s.143 He took pride in battling establishment forces, was willing to challenge party leadership, and became hard to categorize politically.144
As a member of the 1991&lt;U+2013&gt;1993 Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, chaired by Democrat and fellow Vietnam War veteran John Kerry, McCain investigated the fate of U.S. service personnel listed as missing in action during the Vietnam War.145 The committee's unanimous report stated there was &quot;no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia.&quot;146 Helped by McCain's efforts, in 1995 the U.S. normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam.147 McCain was vilified by some POW/MIA activists who, unlike the Arizona senator, believed large numbers of Americans were still held against their will in Southeast Asia.148149150 Since January 1993, McCain has been Chairman of the International Republican Institute, an organization partly funded by the U.S. Government that supports the emergence of political democracy worldwide.151
In 1993 and 1994, McCain voted to confirm President Clinton's nominees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg whom he considered to be qualified for the U.S. Supreme Court. He would later explain that &quot;under our Constitution, it is the president's call to make.&quot;152 McCain had also voted to confirm nominees of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, including Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.153
McCain attacked what he saw as the corrupting influence of large political contributions &lt;U+2013&gt; from corporations, labor unions, other organizations, and wealthy individuals &lt;U+2013&gt; and he made this his signature issue.154 Starting in 1994, he worked with Democratic Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold on campaign finance reform; their McCain-Feingold bill attempted to put limits on &quot;soft money&quot;.155 The efforts of McCain and Feingold were opposed by some of the moneyed interests targeted, by incumbents in both parties, by those who felt spending limits impinged on free political speech and might be unconstitutional as well, and by those who wanted to counterbalance the power of what they saw as media bias.156157 Despite sympathetic coverage in the media, initial versions of the McCain-Feingold Act were filibustered and never came to a vote.158 The term &quot;maverick Republican&quot; became a label frequently applied to McCain, and he has also used the term himself.159160161
Another target of the Arizona senator was pork barrel spending by Congress, and he actively supported the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, which gave the president power to veto individual spending items.162 However, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1998 that the act was unconstitutional.163
In the 1996 presidential election, McCain was again on the short list of possible vice-presidential picks, this time for Republican nominee Bob Dole.164165 The following year, Time magazine named McCain as one of the &quot;25 Most Influential People in America&quot;.166
In 1997, McCain became chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee's purview, but in response said the restricted contributions he received were not part of the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem.167 McCain took on the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns, discourage teenage smokers, increase money for health research studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs.168169 Supported by the Clinton administration but opposed by the industry and most Republicans, the bill failed to gain cloture.170
McCain won re-election to a third senate term in November 1998, prevailing in a landslide over his Democratic opponent, environmental lawyer Ed Ranger.171 In 1999, McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Feingold for their work in trying to enact their campaign finance reform,172 although the bill was still failing repeated attempts to gain cloture.173
In August 1999, his memoir Faith of My Fathers, co-authored with Mark Salter, was published.174 The most successful of his writings, it received positive reviews,175 became a bestseller,176 and was later made into a movie. The book traces McCain's family background and childhood, also covering his time at Annapolis, and his service as a naval aviator before and during the Vietnam War, concluding with his release from captivity in 1973. According to one reviewer, the book describes &quot;the kind of challenges that most of us can barely imagine. It's a fascinating history of a remarkable military family.&quot;177 Another reviewer observed that, &quot;The appearance of John McCain's 'Faith of My Fathers' seems to have been timed to the unfolding Presidential campaign....&quot;178
2000 presidential campaign

McCain announced his candidacy for president on September 27, 1999 in Nashua, New Hampshire, saying he was staging &quot;a fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests, and return it to the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve&quot;.179180 The leader for the Republican nomination was Texas Governor George W. Bush, who had the political and financial support of most of the party establishment.181
McCain focused on the New Hampshire primary, where his message appealed to independents.182 He traveled on a campaign bus called the Straight Talk Express.183 He held many town hall meetings, answering every question voters asked, in a successful example of &quot;retail politics&quot;, and he used free media to compensate for his lack of funds.184 One reporter later recounted that, &quot;McCain talked all day long with reporters on his Straight Talk Express bus; he talked so much that sometimes he said things that he shouldn't have, and that's why the media loved him.&quot;185 On February 1, 2000, he won New Hampshire's primary with 49 percent of the vote to Bush's 30 percent. The Bush campaign and the Republican establishment feared that a McCain victory in the crucial South Carolina primary might give his campaign unstoppable momentum.186187
The Arizona Republic would write that the McCain-Bush primary contest in South Carolina &quot;has entered national political lore as a low-water mark in presidential campaigns&quot;, while The New York Times called it &quot;a painful symbol of the brutality of American politics&quot;.188189190 A variety of interest groups that McCain had challenged in the past ran negative ads.191192 Bush borrowed McCain's earlier language of reform,193 and declined to disassociate himself from a veterans activist who accused McCain (in Bush's presence) of having &quot;abandoned the veterans&quot; on POW/MIA and Agent Orange issues.194195
Incensed,196 McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton, which Bush said was &quot;about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary&quot;.197 An anonymous smear campaign began against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, and audience plants.198199 The smears claimed that McCain had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter was adopted from Bangladesh), that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, that he was a homosexual, and that he was a &quot;Manchurian Candidate&quot; who was either a traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days.200201 The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with the attacks.202
McCain lost South Carolina on February 19, with 42 percent of the vote to Bush's 53 percent,203 in part because Bush mobilized the state's evangelical voters204205 and outspent McCain.206 The win allowed Bush to regain lost momentum.207 McCain would say of the rumor spreaders, &quot;I believe that there is a special place in hell for people like those.&quot;208 According to one report, the South Carolina experience left McCain in a &quot;very dark place&quot;.209
McCain's campaign never completely recovered from his South Carolina defeat, although he did rebound partially by winning in Arizona and Michigan a few days later.210 He made a speech in Virginia Beach that criticized Christian leaders, including Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, as divisive conservatives,211 declaring &quot;... we embrace the fine members of the religious conservative community. But that does not mean that we will pander to their self-appointed leaders.&quot;212 McCain lost the Virginia primary on February 29,213 and on March 7 lost nine of the thirteen primaries on Super Tuesday to Bush.214 With little hope of overcoming Bush's delegate lead, McCain withdrew from the race on March 9, 2000.215 He endorsed Bush two months later,216 and made occasional appearances with the Texas governor during the general election campaign.217
Senate career after 2000

Remainder of third Senate term
McCain began 2001 by breaking with the new George W. Bush administration on a number of matters, including HMO reform, climate change, and gun legislation; McCain-Feingold was opposed by Bush as well.218219 In May 2001, McCain was one of only two Senate Republicans to vote against the Bush tax cuts.220221 Besides the differences with Bush on ideological grounds, there was considerable antagonism between the two remaining from the previous year's campaign.222223 Later, when Republican Senator Jim Jeffords became an Independent, throwing control of the Senate to the Democrats, McCain defended Jeffords against &quot;self-appointed enforcers of party loyalty&quot;.224 Indeed, there was speculation at the time, and in years since, about McCain himself possibly leaving the Republican Party, but McCain has always adamantly denied that he ever considered doing so.225226227 Beginning in 2001, McCain used political capital gained from his presidential run, as well as improved legislative skills and relationships with other members, to become one of the Senate's most influential members.228
 After the September 11, 2001 attacks, McCain supported Bush and the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.229230 He and then-Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman wrote the legislation that created the 9/11 Commission,231 while he and Democratic Senator Fritz Hollings co-sponsored the Aviation and Transportation Security Act that federalized airport security.232
In March 2002, McCain-Feingold passed in both Houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Bush.233234 Seven years in the making, it was McCain's greatest legislative achievement.235236
Meanwhile, in discussions over proposed U.S. action against Iraq, McCain was a strong supporter of the Bush administration's position.237 He stated that Iraq was &quot;a clear and present danger to the United States of America&quot;, and voted accordingly for the Iraq War Resolution in October 2002.238 He predicted that U.S. forces would be treated as liberators by a large number of the Iraqi people.239 In May 2003, McCain voted against the second round of Bush tax cuts, saying it was unwise at a time of war.240 By November 2003, after a trip to Iraq, he was publicly questioning Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, saying that more U.S. troops were needed; the following year, McCain announced that he had lost confidence in Rumsfeld.241242
In October 2003, McCain and Lieberman co-sponsored the Climate Stewardship Act that would have introduced a cap and trade system aimed at returning greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels; the bill was defeated with 55 votes to 43 in the Senate.243 They reintroduced modified versions of the Act two additional times, most recently in January 2007 with the co-sponsorship of Barack Obama, among others.244
In the 2004 U.S. presidential election campaign, McCain was once again frequently mentioned for the vice-presidential slot, only this time as part of the Democratic ticket under nominee John Kerry.245246247 McCain said that Kerry had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have accepted it if he had.248249250 At the 2004 Republican National Convention, McCain supported Bush for re-election, praising Bush's management of the War on Terror since the September 11 attacks.251 At the same time, the Senator defended Kerry's Vietnam war record.252 By August 2004, McCain had the best favorable-to-unfavorable rating (55 percent to 19 percent) of any national politician;253 he campaigned for Bush much more than he had four years previously, though the two remained situational allies rather than friends.254
McCain was also up for re-election as Senator in 2004. He defeated little-known Democratic schoolteacher Stuart Starky with his biggest margin of victory, garnering 77 percent of the vote.255
Fourth Senate term
In May 2005, McCain led the so-called &quot;Gang of 14&quot; in the Senate, which established a compromise that preserved the ability of senators to filibuster judicial nominees, but only in &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot;.256 The compromise took the steam out of the filibuster movement, but some Republicans remained disappointed that the compromise did not eliminate filibusters of judicial nominees in all circumstances.257 McCain subsequently cast Supreme Court confirmation votes in favor of John Roberts and Samuel Alito, calling them &quot;two of the finest justices ever appointed to the United States Supreme Court.&quot;258
Breaking from his 2001 and 2003 votes, McCain supported the Bush tax cut extension in May 2006, saying not to do so would amount to a tax increase.259 Working with Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy, McCain was a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform, which would involve legalization, guest worker programs, and border enforcement components. The Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act was never voted on in 2005, while the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 passed the Senate in May 2006 but failed in the House.260 In June 2007, President Bush, McCain, and others made the strongest push yet for such a bill, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, but it aroused intense grassroots opposition among talk radio listeners and others, some of whom furiously characterized the proposal as an &quot;amnesty&quot; program,261 and the bill twice failed to gain cloture in the Senate.262
By the mid-2000s, the increased Indian gaming that McCain had helped bring about was a $23 billion industry.263 He was twice chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, in 1995&lt;U+2013&gt;1997 and 2005&lt;U+2013&gt;2007, and his Committee helped expose the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal.264265 By 2005 and 2006, McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that would limit creation of off-reservation casinos,266 as well as limiting the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos.267
 Owing to his time as a POW, McCain has been recognized for his sensitivity to the detention and interrogation of detainees in the War on Terror. In October 2005, McCain introduced the McCain Detainee Amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill for 2005, and the Senate voted 90&lt;U+2013&gt;9 to support the amendment.268 It prohibits inhumane treatment of prisoners, including prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, by confining military interrogations to the techniques in the U.S. Army Field Manual on Interrogation. Although Bush had threatened to veto the bill if McCain's amendment was included,269 the President announced in December 2005 that he accepted McCain's terms and would &quot;make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture, whether it be here at home or abroad&quot;.270 This stance, among others, led to McCain being named by Time magazine in 2006 as one of America's 10 Best Senators.271 McCain voted in February 2008 against a bill containing a ban on waterboarding,272 which provision was later narrowly passed and vetoed by Bush. However, the bill in question contained other provisions to which McCain objected, and his spokesman stated: &quot;This wasn't a vote on waterboarding. This was a vote on applying the standards of the [Army] field manual to CIA personnel.&quot;273
Meanwhile, McCain continued questioning the progress of the war in Iraq. In September 2005, he remarked upon Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers' optimistic outlook on the war's progress: &quot;Things have not gone as well as we had planned or expected, nor as we were told by you, General Myers.&quot;274 In August 2006, he criticized the administration for continually understating the effectiveness of the insurgency: &quot;We [have] not told the American people how tough and difficult this could be.&quot;275 From the beginning, McCain strongly supported the Iraq troop surge of 2007.276 The strategy's opponents labeled it &quot;McCain's plan&quot;277 and University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato said, &quot;McCain owns Iraq just as much as Bush does now.&quot;278 The surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year, even within the Republican Party,279 as McCain's presidential campaign was underway; faced with the consequences, McCain frequently responded, &quot;I would much rather lose a campaign than a war.&quot;280 In March 2008, McCain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in Iraq, as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began.281
2008 presidential campaign


 John McCain formally announced his intention to run for President of the United States on April 25, 2007 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.282 He stated that: &quot;I'm not running for President to be somebody, but to do something; to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and needless things.&quot;283 He also said that the United States should never fight a war without fully committing the necessary resources, unlike what initially occurred in Iraq.284
McCain's oft-cited strengths as a presidential candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers.285 During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346 events286 and helped raise more than $10.5 million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions, while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make.287 Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began,288 McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls as the year progressed.
McCain had fundraising problems in the first half of 2007, due in part to his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was unpopular among the Republican base electorate.289290 Large-scale campaign staff downsizing took place in early July, but McCain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race.291 Later that month, the candidate's campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed.292 McCain slumped badly in national polls, often running third or fourth with 15 percent or less support.
The Arizona senator subsequently resumed his familiar position as a political underdog,293 riding the Straight Talk Express and taking advantage of free media such as debates and sponsored events.294 By December 2007, the Republican race was unsettled, with none of the top-tier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major vulnerabilities with different elements of the Republican base electorate.295 McCain was showing a resurgence, in particular with renewed strength in New Hampshire &lt;U+2013&gt; the scene of his 2000 triumph &lt;U+2013&gt; and was bolstered further by the endorsements of The Boston Globe, the Manchester Union-Leader, and almost two dozen other state newspapers,296 as well as from Independent Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman.297298 McCain decided not to campaign significantly in the January 3, 2008 Iowa caucuses, which saw a win by former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee.
McCain's comeback plan paid off when he won the New Hampshire primary on January 8, defeating former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney in a close contest, to once again become one of the front-runners in the race.299 In mid-January, McCain placed first in the South Carolina primary, narrowly defeating Mike Huckabee.300 Pundits credited the third-place finisher, Tennessee's former U.S. Senator Fred Thompson, with drawing votes from Huckabee in South Carolina, thereby giving a narrow win to McCain.301 A week later, McCain won the Florida primary,302 beating Romney again in a close contest; Giuliani then dropped out and endorsed McCain.303
On February 5, McCain won both the majority of states and delegates in the Super Tuesday Republican primaries, giving him a commanding lead toward the Republican nomination. Romney departed from the race on February 7.304 McCain's wins in the March 4 primaries clinched a majority of the delegates, and he became the presumptive Republican nominee.305
If he wins the presidency, John McCain's birth (in Panama) would be the first presidential birth outside the current 50 states. A bipartisan legal review306 as well as a unanimous Senate resolution307 indicate that he is nevertheless a natural-born citizen of the United States, which is a constitutional requirement to become president, although the matter is still a subject of some legal controversy.308 Also, if inaugurated in 2009 at age 72 years and 144 days, he would be the oldest U.S. president upon ascension to the presidency,309 and the second-oldest president to be inaugurated.310  McCain has addressed concerns about his age and past health concerns, stating in 2005 that his health was &quot;excellent&quot;.311 He has been treated for a type of skin cancer called melanoma, and an operation in 2000 for that condition left a noticeable mark on the left side of his face.312 McCain's prognosis appears favorable, according to independent experts, especially because he has already survived without a recurrence for more than seven years.313 In May 2008, McCain's campaign let the press review his medical records, and he was described as appearing cancer-free, having a strong heart and in general good health.314
Upon clinching enough delegates for the nomination, McCain's focus shifted toward the general election, while Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton fought a prolonged battle for the Democratic nomination.315 McCain staged a &quot;biographical tour&quot;, introduced various policy proposals, and sought to improve his fundraising.316317 Cindy McCain, who accounts for most of the couple's wealth with an estimated net worth of $100 million,318 made part of her tax returns public in May.319 After facing criticism about lobbyists in its midst, the McCain campaign issued new rules in May to avoid conflicts of interest, causing several top staffers to leave.320321
When Obama became the Democrats' presumptive nominee in early June, McCain proposed joint town hall meetings that would include audience interaction, but Obama instead requested more traditional debates for the fall.322 In July, a staff shake-up put Steve Schmidt in full operational control of the McCain campaign.323 Throughout these summer months, Obama typically led McCain in national polls by single-digit margins,324 and also led in several key swing states.325 McCain acknowledged his familiar underdog role, which was due at least in part to the overall challenges Republicans faced in the election year.326327 McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that go with it, while criticizing his opponent for becoming the first major party candidate in history to opt out of such financing.328329 McCain's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead, compared to Obama's.330
McCain's nomination is set to become official at the Republican Convention, from September 1 until September 4. Three presidential debates are then scheduled, for September 26, October 7, and October 15.331 The election is set for November 4.
Political positions

Various interest groups have given Senator McCain scores or grades as to how well his votes align with the positions of each group.332 The American Conservative Union awarded McCain a lifetime rating of 82 percent through 2007, while McCain has an average lifetime 13 percent &quot;Liberal Quotient&quot; from Americans for Democratic Action through 2007.333334
The Almanac of American Politics rates congressional votes as liberal or conservative on the political spectrum, in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005&lt;U+2013&gt;2006, McCain's average ratings were as follows: the economic rating was 59 percent conservative and 41 percent liberal, the social rating was 54 percent conservative and 38 percent liberal, and the foreign rating was 56 percent conservative and 43 percent liberal.335
Columnists such as Robert Robb and Matthew Continetti have used a formulation devised by William F. Buckley, Jr. to describe McCain as &quot;conservative&quot; but not &quot;a conservative&quot;, meaning that while McCain usually tends towards conservative positions, he is not &quot;anchored by the philosophical tenets of modern American conservatism&quot;.336337
The two political issues that voters have been most concerned about in 2008 are the economy and Iraq.338 On the economy, McCain says he would make the Bush tax cuts permanent instead of letting them expire, he would eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax so as to assist the middle-class, he would double the personal exemption for dependents, reduce the corporate tax rate, and offer a new research and development tax credit.339340 At the same time, he pledges to eliminate pork-barrel spending, freeze nondefense discretionary spending for a year or more, and reduce Medicare growth.341 McCain is also opposed to high salaries and lucrative severance deals of corporate CEOs.342343 Another proposal of the Arizona senator is to build 45 new nuclear reactors by 2030, in order to fight climate change and establish U.S. energy independence.344
On Iraq, McCain's goal is that by 2013 most of the servicemen and women will have returned, the Iraq War will have been won, and Iraq will be a functioning democracy, &quot;although still suffering from the lingering effects of decades of tyranny and centuries of sectarian tension.&quot; McCain expects that by 2013, there will still be violence, but at a much-reduced level, and without American troops in a direct combat role.345346
From the late 1990s until 2008, McCain was a board member of Project Vote Smart (PVS) which was set up by Richard Kimball, his 1986 Senate opponent.347 PVS provides non-partisan information about the political positions of McCain348 and other candidates for political office. Additionally, McCain uses his Senate web site, and his 2008 campaign web site, to describe his political positions.349350
Cultural and political image

John McCain's personal character has been a dominant feature of his public image.351 This image includes the military service of both himself and his family,352 his maverick political persona,353 his temper,354 his admitted problem of occasional ill-considered remarks,355 and his close ties to his children from both his marriages.356
McCain's political appeal has been more nonpartisan and less ideological compared to many other national politicians.357 His stature and reputation stem partly from his service in the Vietnam War.358 He also carries physical vestiges of his war wounds, as well as his melanoma surgery.359 When campaigning, he quips: &quot;I am older than dirt and have more scars than Frankenstein.&quot;360
The Arizona senator considers himself to be a straight-talking public servant, and acknowledges also being impatient.361 Other traits include a penchant for lucky charms,362 a fondness for hiking,363 and a sense of humor that has sometimes backfired spectacularly, as when he made a joke in 1998 about the Clintons that was not fit to print in newspapers.364 McCain has not shied away from addressing his shortcomings, and apologizing for them.365366 He is known for sometimes being prickly367 and hot-tempered368 with Senate colleagues, but his relations with his own Senate staff have been more cordial, and have inspired loyalty towards him.369370
Regarding his temper, McCain acknowledges it371 while also saying that the stories have been exaggerated.372373 Having a temper is not unusual for U.S. leaders,374 nor is it unusual for leaders to be passionate and engaged.375 McCain has employed both profanity376 and shouting on occasion, and such incidents have become less frequent over the years.377378 Senator Joe Lieberman has made this observation: &quot;It is not the kind of anger that is a loss of control. He is a very controlled person.&quot;379 Senator Thad Cochran, who has known McCain for decades and has battled him over earmarks,380381 has expressed concern about a McCain presidency: &quot;He is erratic. He is hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me.&quot;382 Ultimately Cochran decided to support McCain for president, after it was clear he would win the nomination.383
All of John McCain's family members are on good terms with him,384 and he has defended them against some of the negative consequences of his high-profile political lifestyle.385386 His family's military tradition extends to the latest generation: son John Sidney IV (&quot;Jack&quot;) is enrolled in the U.S. Naval Academy, son James has served with the Marines in Iraq, and son Doug flew jets in the Navy.387388
