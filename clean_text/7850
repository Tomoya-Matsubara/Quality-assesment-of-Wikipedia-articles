Mint.com is a free web-based personal financial management service created by entrepreneur Aaron Patzer1. Mint provides account aggregation through a deal with Yodlee. Mint's primary service allows for users to track bank, credit card, investment, and loan transactions and balances through a single user interface.
Mint has garnered media coverage from a number of blogs and media outlets such as the New York Times,1 GigaOM,2 VentureBeat,3 the Orlando Sentinel,4 and the San Francisco Chronicle.5
The company is located in Mountain View, California. Mint currently only supports financial institutions based in the United States.6
On November 2, 2009, Intuit completed acquisition of Mint.com.7
Investment and Finances
Mint has raised over $31M in venture capital funding from DAG Ventures, Shasta Ventures, and First Round Capital,89 as well as from angel investors including Ram Shriram, an early investor in Google.10 The latest round of $14M was closed on August 4, 200911, and reported by CEO Aaron Patzer as preemptive.12 TechCrunch later pegged the valuation of Mint at $140M.13
Currently, revenue is generated through lead generation in which Mint.com recommends highly personalized financial products to its users.14
It was reported by Bloomberg that Mint was considering selling access to anonymous consumer data as a form of revenue.15 This led to some criticism as personal data can be de-anonymized.16 Aaron Patzer later responded by calling Bloomberg's headline a &quot;misinterpretation&quot;, as only aggregate spending indexes would be published, not individual consumer data.17
Sale
TechCrunch reported on September 13, 2009 that Intuit would acquire Mint for $170M.18 An official announcement was made the following day.
On November 2, 2009, Intuit announced their acquisition of Mint.com was complete. The former CEO of Mint.com, Aaron Patzer, was named vice president and general manager of Intuit&lt;U+2019&gt;s personal finance group, responsible for Mint.com and all Quicken online, desktop and mobile offerings.19
