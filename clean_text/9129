&quot;Doomsday&quot; is the thirteenth and final episode in the second series of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. It was first broadcast on 8 July 2006 and is the conclusion of a two-part story; the first part, &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot;, was broadcast on 1 July 2006. The two-part story features the Daleks, presumed extinct after the events of the 2005 series' finale, and the Cybermen, who appeared in &quot;Rise of the Cybermen&quot; and &quot;The Age of Steel&quot;, both species having unexpectedly arrived on Earth at the conclusion of &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot;.
The episode's plot consists mostly of the Daleks and Cybermen waging a global war, the first conflict between the two species in Doctor Who{{'}}s 45-year history, with humanity caught in the crossfire. The Doctor, the Tyler family, and Mickey Smith fight for their lives trying to revert the situation, in which they are successful, but at an emotional cost to the Doctor and Rose as they are split apart.
The episode marks the final regular appearances of Billie Piper as companion Rose Tyler, Noel Clarke as Rose's ex-boyfriend and previous companion Mickey Smith, and Camille Coduri and Shaun Dingwall as Rose's parents Jackie and Pete Tyler. Billie Piper will reprise her role as Rose Tyler for three episodes in the fourth series.1
The episode is among the most popular Doctor Who episodes since the show's revival. It was nominated along with &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot; for the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form, which was won by the fourth episode in the series, &quot;The Girl in the Fireplace&quot;. As of 2008, it shares the new series' highest Audience Appreciation rating of &quot;89&quot; with &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot;, and is generally favoured by critics for both the Cybermen&lt;U+2013&gt;Dalek conflict and the farewell scene between the Doctor and Rose.
Plot
The episode's opening continues from the final scene of &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot;, where Dr Singh, Mickey and Rose are trapped in a sealed room within Torchwood Tower. Four Daleks, accompanied by a device known as the &quot;Genesis Ark&quot;, have emerged from the void ship.2 A Dalek Supreme, Dalek Sec extracts information about contemporary Earth from Singh, killing him in the process. He discovers that a separate invasion is in progress, and sends Dalek Thay out to investigate. The Cybermen, having taken control of Torchwood and encouraged mankind to &quot;upgrade&quot;, detect the Dalek technology and offer an alliance. Thay denies, leading the two species to declare war on each other.
While discussing humanity with the Doctor, the Cyber Leader is destroyed by a strike team lead by Jake Simmonds, from the same universe as the Cybermen. Jake, having then taken the Doctor to his universe, explains the Cybermen's actions along with Pete Tyler, who implores the Doctor to close the breach.
In the chamber where they are being held, Rose tells Mickey that they were kept alive because their touch would be able to activate the Ark. Sec explains that the Cult cannot open the Ark as it is stolen Time Lord technology, and demands that Rose opens it. She accepts, but goads the Daleks about annihilating their Emperor3 until the Doctor appears. Upon realising that the Daleks are the Cult of Skaro, he uses his sonic screwdriver to allow Cybermen to combat the Daleks. While escaping the firefight, Mickey accidentally activates the Ark. After the Daleks have defeated the Cybermen, they move into the Torchwood storage area and begin a three-way battle with Torchwood and the Cybermen, before releasing the contents of the Ark above London &lt;U+2013&gt; millions of Daleks, who begin exterminating both Cybermen and humans.
The Doctor arrives in the room where the main breach is located, and explains that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in background radiation. He plans to open the breach to create a vacuum effect, but notes that Rose and Mickey also crossed the Void. While Mickey, Jackie, and Pete cross into the parallel universe to avoid being sucked into the Void, Rose refuses to leave the Doctor, and after opening the breach, they each hold onto a pair of magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks become drawn in. During this process, Rose's lever becomes damaged, forcing her to release the clamp, until she loses her grip of the lever and lets go. Before the breach closes upon her, Pete catches her and teleports her to his world.
Some time later, Rose has a dream where she hears the Doctor's voice calling her. The Tyler family follow the voice to a remote bay in Norway called Bad Wolf Bay. There, an image of the Doctor appears, who harnessed the power of a supernova to transmit an image through one of the final breaches. As the breach is to close permanently in two minutes, the pair share one last conversation, in which Rose breaks down in tears and tells him that she loves him, but as the Doctor starts to reply, the breach closes. In the TARDIS, a tearful Doctor regains his composure and sets a new course. He looks up to see a woman in a wedding dress, who demands to know where she is.4
Continuity
&quot;Doomsday&quot; is the first episode in the history of Doctor Who in which the Cybermen and the Daleks appear together on screen. Both Cybermen and Daleks were featured in The Five Doctors and &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot;, but only in separate scenes.56
The Cult of Skaro's purpose, thinking as the enemy thinks, is to combat the limits of the Daleks' logic, and is a concept that was visited several times previously; in The Evil of the Daleks, the Daleks attempted to use &quot;the Human Factor&quot; to increase their strategic effectiveness,7 while in Remembrance of the Daleks, the Renegade Dalek faction used a human schoolgirl as a battle computer.8
The episode's events created a minor story arc for the following series and spin-off series Torchwood. The effects of the &quot;cyber-conversion&quot; of humans to Cybermen were later explored in the Torchwood episode &quot;Cyberwoman&quot; and spin-off novella Made of Steel. The loss of Rose was used several times in the third series &lt;U+2013&gt; the memory was used in an attempt to weaken the Doctor in &quot;The Shakespeare Code&quot;,9 and was an annoyance to companions Donna Noble10 and Martha Jones.11 The loss of Rose upset him during &quot;The Runaway Bride&quot;,12 but it also allowed him to &quot;keep on fighting&quot; several times.13
Production
 The concept of the Daleks and Cybermen appearing together on screen is not new; in December 1967, the BBC approached Terry Nation to have both races in a serial, but Nation vetoed this idea. The concept came to Davies while mapping out the 2006 series &lt;U+2013&gt; the story would both serve to resurrect the popular Daleks and provide a suitable exit for Piper, who had decided to leave Doctor Who after two series.14
The two-part finale was originally going to take place in Cardiff on the time rift which was the focus of the episodes &quot;The Unquiet Dead&quot; and &quot;Boom Town&quot;. With the commission of the Torchwood series in 2005, Davies decided to base the spin-off in Cardiff and relocate &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot; and &quot;Doomsday&quot; to Canary Wharf in London.15
To ensure that Clarke and Dingwall were available for filming, the story was filmed in the season's third production block along with &quot;Rise of the Cybermen&quot; and &quot;The Age of Steel&quot;. Filming for the story started on 2 November 2005 on location in Kennington, but this story did not become the primary focus of the production crew until 29 November, when filming began on the scenes in and around the sphere chamber. The scene of the Tylers driving through Norway was filmed at Bridgend on 6 December, while the scenes in the lever room, the main setting for the story, were filmed between 12 December and 15 December, and 3 January and 5 January 2006. Greenscreen work for Rose being sucked into the void took place on 13 January and the skirmish between the military and Cybermen on the bridge was filmed on 15 January.16
The penultimate scene of the episode, the Doctor's farewell to Rose, was filmed on 16 January 2006, and was the last day of filming for Clarke and Dingwall. While Piper's last scene was Rose's reunion with the Doctor in &quot;The Satan Pit&quot; on 31 March,17 the shoot was rather emotional,18 to the point there were several tears on set.19 The last scene, Catherine Tate's appearance in the TARDIS as Donna Noble, was filmed on 31 March during the wrap party, and was the last usage of the TARDIS set that had been used since 2005. To ensure the secrecy of Rose's departure and Tate's appearance, only Piper and Tennant were given scripts of the departure scene, and director Graeme Harper was not informed of the final scene until the last possible second.20
An item of discussion between the production staff was over who would rescue Rose; Davies and Julie Gardner wanted Pete to rescue her, while Clarke and Phil Collinson wanted Mickey. The position was finally given to Pete, to emphasise that he had accepted Rose as a surrogate daughter.21 The Doctor's intended reply to Rose was also discussed; Davies, who left the reply unspecified, stated he didn't know when asked by Collinson on the commentary, while Gardner vehemently believed the Doctor would reciprocate Rose's love.22
Some elements of the story were inspired by Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. Pullman was &quot;flattered&quot; by the references in the episode, and compared Davies' actions to his own practice of referencing works.23
Music



&quot;I wanted to get that kind of throbbing, sort of hurt, sound of quite emotional rock, because I thought that's Rose would do if she was hurting and ran up to her bedroom and locked herself in her room and had a good old cry, really.&quot;
Murray Gold on the subject of &quot;Doomsday&quot;24

As well as using existing music such as the themes for the Daleks, Cybermen and Rose, Murray Gold specially composed a piece of music for Rose's farewell, entitled &quot;Doomsday&quot;, which featured vocal work from Melanie Pappenheim. Instead of using the swelling violins that Davies and the rest of the production team had expected, Gold took a minimalist approach. When pitching the track to the production team, Gold described the track as representing Rose's unbridled energy and determination as she searches for the Doctor. The piece uses the same vocal work from &quot;Rose&quot; when Rose first enters the TARDIS, thus creating a bookend effect.25 The piece is a favourite among fans, especially executive producer Julie Gardner,26 and is among the reasons, along with Pappenheim's overall contribution and the song &quot;Song for Ten&quot; from &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;, that the a soundtrack of both series was released several months later.2728
Broadcast and reception
To protect as much information concerning the episode as possible, the final scene of &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot; was withheld, the BBC website's Fear Forecasters were not allowed to see the episode before its airing,29 and access to copies was restricted. Despite this, the Dalek Sec prop, which had been previously unused, had invaded the stage at the 2006 BAFTA Television Awards while the production team were collecting an award.30 A similar moratorium would be placed on the following series' finale &quot;Last of the Time Lords&quot;.31
Overnight ratings released stated that 7.72 million people watched &quot;Doomsday&quot; with a 43% share of the audience, with a peak of 8.58 million viewers in the last five minutes of the episode. The episode's finalised average viewing figure was 8.22 million viewers and was, excepting World Cup games, the second most watched television programme of the week, behind an episode of Coronation Street, and eighth most-watched overall. The companion episode of Doctor Who Confidential gained just over one million viewers, making it the second most watched programme on a non-terrestrial channel that week.32 The ratings for the episode were higher than the following World Cup match between Germany and Portugal, which had a million less viewers.33
&quot;Doomsday&quot; is one of the most popular episodes of the revived Doctor Who. It gained an audience Appreciation Index of 89, the highest for all new series episodes along with &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot;,3435 and is the only episode of Doctor Who to receive a perfect &quot;10&quot; rating on IGN,36 who congratulated Davies on making an action-packed episode so emotional.37 Television Without Pity gave the episode an &quot;A+&quot; rating.38 The Stage commented that the Dalek-Cybermen conflict was the &quot;only thing worth watching&quot; at the weekend, overshadowing even the World Cup Final, and that the parting scene was &quot;beautifully written and movingly played&quot;, with &quot;not a dry eye in the universe&quot;.39 Dek Hogan of Digital Spy stated that the episode was &quot;beautifully balanced and with moments of high excitement and touching poignancy&quot; and that the single oil tear shed by the Cyberman version of Hartman was a &quot;nice touch&quot;, but criticised Catherine Tate's appearance as being unnecessary to end the episode and for &quot;breaking the mood&quot;.40 Stephen Brook of The Guardian thought that the episode was &quot;a highpoint of the modern series, highly emotional, scary and genuinely exciting&quot;, Rose's departure was &quot;brilliantly handled&quot;, and positively compared the episode's plot of a war between &quot;the greatest monsters in the programme history&quot; against the film Alien vs. Predator.41
After its initial airing, the episode was released on DVD with &quot;Fear Her&quot; and &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot; on 25 September 2006.42 It was first aired on CBC Television on 19 February 2007.43 The story (&quot;Army of Ghosts&quot;/&quot;Doomsday&quot;) was one of three Doctor Who stories from the second series to be nominated for the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form; the other stories nominated were &quot;School Reunion&quot; and &quot;The Girl in the Fireplace&quot;,44 the award won by the latter.45
