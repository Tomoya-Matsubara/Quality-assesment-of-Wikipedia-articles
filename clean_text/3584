The district centers on Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs. He was re-elected in 2010.1 Ellison is a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus for the 112th Congress.
He is the first Muslim23 to be elected to the Congress. He is also the first African American elected to the House from Minnesota.4
Early life, education, and career
Keith Ellison, the third of five sons, was born and raised Roman Catholic5 in Detroit, Michigan by his parents, Clida (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Martinez) and Leonard Ellison, a social worker and a psychiatrist, respectively.678 Ellison and three of his siblings became lawyers while the other became a doctor. One of his brothers is also the pastor of the Baptist &quot;Church of the New Covenant&quot; in Detroit.9 Ellison's youth was influenced by the involvement of his family in the civil rights movement, including the work of his grandfather as a member of the NAACP in Louisiana.10
 Ellison graduated from the University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy in 1981 where he was active in sports and was a Senator in the student government.1112 At age 19, while attending Wayne State University in Detroit, Ellison converted from Catholicism to Islam, later giving the following explanation: &quot;I can't claim that I was the most observant Catholic at the time [of my conversion]. I had begun to really look around and ask myself about the social circumstances of the country, issues of justice, issues of change. When I looked at my spiritual life, and I looked at what might inform social change, justice in society... I found Islam.&quot;13141516
After graduating with a Bachelors in economics in 1987, he married his high school sweetheart17 and moved to Minneapolis to attend the University of Minnesota Law School. While attending, Ellison wrote several articles in support of Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. He graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1990.1819
Ellison and his former wife Kim, a high school mathematics teacher,20 had four children born between 1989 and 1997.21 They have a daughter, Amirah; and three sons, Jeremiah, Elijah, and Isaiah.22 Kim is not Muslim, but their four children have been raised in that faith.23 During Ellison's 2006 campaign, Kim Ellison revealed that she had been living with moderate multiple sclerosis for several years.24 He filed for a legal separation from Kim in 201025 and their divorce was finalized on May 2, 2012.26
After law school, Ellison worked with the firm of Lindquist &amp; Vennum for three years where he was a litigator specializing in civil rights, employment, and criminal defense law.2728 Ellison then became executive director of the nonprofit Legal Rights Center in Minneapolis that specialized in the defense of indigent clients.29 Upon leaving the Legal Rights Center, Ellison entered private practice with the law firm Hassan &amp; Reed Ltd, specializing in trial practice.30 In addition to his work for the Legal Rights Center, Ellison has also been regularly involved in community service. He served as the unpaid host of a public affairs talk program at KMOJ radio.31 He has also often volunteered as a track coach for several organizations, working with youth between the ages of 5 and 18. He said, &quot;It&lt;U+2019&gt;s a great community-building device because it&lt;U+2019&gt;s for all ages and all genders. Everyone can find a way to fit in.&quot;32
Minnesota House of Representatives
In November 2002, Ellison was elected to his first public office, as a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives serving House District 58B. At the time he took his seat, his party was the smallest House minority in Minnesota history.33 During this session, Ellison was appointed to the Governmental Operations &amp; Veterans Affairs Policy Committee, the Judiciary Policy &amp; Finance Committee and the Local Government &amp; Metropolitan Affairs Committee. In this session he spearheaded an ethics complaint against Rep. Arlon Lindner concerning remarks about homosexuals in the Holocaust.
Ellison carried 84% of the votes and was re-elected to the seat for Minnesota&lt;U+2019&gt;s House District 58B in the 2004 election. During the 84th session, Ellison served on the Civil Law &amp; Elections Committee, and the Public Safety Policy &amp; Finance Committee. With his election to Congress, Ellison's seat in the Minnesota House of Representatives was filled by Augustine Dominguez, a Latino community activist and fellow member of the DFL.34

Elections

Ellison's House seat was previously held by Martin Olav Sabo, whose announcement of his intention to retire precipitated Ellison's candidacy. At the DFL Convention on May 6, 2006, Ellison won the party endorsement over 9 other candidates, leading 2-to-1 on the first ballot, and winning endorsement on the 4th ballot. In the primary, Ellison faced former state senator Ember Reichgott Junge, Minneapolis city council member Paul Ostrow, and Sabo's chief of staff Mike Erlandson, whom Sabo had endorsed. Ellison won the primary on September 12, 2006, with 41% of the vote.35 One issued raised by Ellison's campaign opponents was repeated incidents where his drivers license was suspended drivers license for failure to pay tickets and fines.36 Ellison had also failed to pay all or part of his income taxes in five separate years between 1992 and 2000, forcing the state and Internal Revenue Service to put liens on his home. He later paid in excess of $18,000.3738
In the November 2006 election, Ellison faced Republican Alan Fine, the Green Party's Jay Pond, and Tammy Lee of the Independence Party. Ellison won the seat with 56% of the vote.3940
Tenure
Ellison was elected to the House of Representatives on November 7, 2006, and sworn in on January 4, 2007. He garnered national attention with his decision to use a Qur'an that once belonged to President Thomas Jefferson for his reenacted swearing in ceremony, which generated both praise and criticisms from political pundits.
At the time of his swearing in, Ellison said he intended to focus on wages, housing, &quot;relief and justice for the middle class&quot;, and ending the U.S. involvement in the Iraq War.41 Ellison was also a vocal critic of President George W. Bush's Administration, and sought a position on the House Judiciary Committee for oversight.42
In his first week as a Member of Congress, Ellison voted with the new Democratic majority as part of the 100-Hour Plan to raise the minimum wage, voted for federal funding of stem cell research, and voted to allow Medicare to negotiate pharmaceutical prices.43

Credit reform


 On May 3, 2007, Ellison introduced a bill to outlaw universal default, the practice whereby credit card companies raise interest rates on customers if they are behind on payments to any other creditors. The bill was also supported by House Financial Services Committee chairman Rep. Barney Frank. Ellison, who described the bill as &quot;the beginning of a whole credit reform effort we&lt;U+2019&gt;re going to be pursuing,&quot; also announced his interest in limiting high interest rates on credit cards and easing the process for those who have a legitimate need to file bankruptcy.44 This provision ultimately became law in 2009 as part of the &quot;Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights&quot; portion of the Credit CARD Act of 2009.

Political positions
Civil rights
In 2009 and 2011, Ellison had a 100% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America indicating a pro-choice voting record.4647 In 2009, Ellison condemned the assassination of Dr. George Tiller by an anti-abortion activist, saying &quot;There is no room in America to &lt;U+2018&gt;justify&lt;U+2019&gt; murder in the name of ideological differences. I condemn the act committed against Dr. Tiller as well as those who take comfort from his death.&quot;48
In an interview with the BBC's Program Outlook, on Nov. 12th 2010, Ellison was asked to describe his constituents. He answered: &quot;The district I represent is the kind of district where you can have a Member of Congress stand up for religious tolerance and against religious bigotry, against anyone, but also stand up for the rights of gays too.&quot;49
Iraq War
After President Bush vetoed HR 1591 that provided military funding for the Iraq War because it contained timetables for withdrawal, Ellison and fellow Minnesota Rep. Betty McCollum, joined House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top House Democrats in voting &quot;no&quot; to HR 2206 that provided the funding without any timetables. The bill passed the House on a 280 to 142 margin.50
Ellison joined fellow Minnesota freshman Democrat Tim Walz in opposing President George W. Bush's plan to increase troop levels in Iraq.51 On January 10, 2007, Bush announced his plans for the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. The gist of this announcement had been known around the Capitol for over a week, and when the Associated Press asked Ellison for his reaction to the idea on January 8, 2007, he stated that it was &quot;way too late, way too little ...So rather than do something small and ineffective, why not get about the business of what we're going to have to do eventually, which is to begin to end the occupation?&quot;52 Ellison called for an immediate withdrawal in Iraq: &quot;We could describe it as a redeployment or withdrawal, but I think we have run the course in terms of our ability to resolve this conflict militarily. I think we need to have a political and economic and diplomatic engagement, and we need to encourage the forces that are in Iraq to begin to resolve the violence in Iraq.&quot;53 When asked if he would support Bush&lt;U+2019&gt;s call for an additional $100 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Ellison said, &quot;I want to see [the request] first, I want to actually look at it, but I'm not inclined to continue to support a war or an occupation that he has no plans to get us out of, and which is so costly in terms of dollars and lives of American soldiers but also Iraqis.&quot;54 The White House, when asked for a reaction to the comments, referred to a previous statement by press secretary Tony Snow: &quot;Democrats will have to decide where they stand on two issues: &lt;U+2018&gt;No. 1, do you want Iraq to succeed, and, if so, what does that mean? And, No. 2, do you believe in supporting the troops as you say, and how do you express that support?&lt;U+2019&gt;&quot;55
Bush administration
On July 25, 2007, Ellison voted in the House Judiciary Committee to issue citations of Contempt of Congress to White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers for &quot;failure to comply with subpoenas on the firings of several federal prosecutors&quot;.56
On June 28, 2007, Ellison became a cosponsor of Rep. Dennis Kucinich bill to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney for &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors.&quot; Ellison's spokesperson, Rick Jauert, said the effort was &quot;largely to send a message&quot; and that Ellison &quot;has no illusions that this is going anywhere and that's fine. We've got more important things to do that affect people's daily lives. He basically signed on out of principle, as an expression of the importance of the rule of law &lt;U+2014&gt; that nobody is above the law, not even the vice president.&quot;57
On July 8, 2007, Ellison gave a speech in Edina, Minnesota, where he denounced Bush's commutation of Lewis Libby's sentence: &quot;If Libby gets pardoned, then he should not have the cover of the Fifth Amendment. He's going to have to come clean and tell the truth. Now, he could get Gonzales-itis [referring to U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales], you know, with 71 lapses of memory within a two-hour period.&quot;58 He also criticized Bush's White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives saying, &quot;This is basically the Department of Religious Outreach ... . It's essentially a public-relations outreach arm for the Bush administration to reach out to the far right of the evangelical Christian movement. That's really all it is.&quot;59
Human rights
Ellison issued a statement Friday March 21, 2008 that criticized the Chinese government for its Tibet policy and for its relationship with Sudan's leaders 'as they commit genocide on the citizens of Darfur.'&quot; 60
Ellison was arrested along with seven other people including U.S. Representatives James McGovern, John Lewis, Donna Edwards, Lynn Woolsey for civil disobedience in April 2009 when they spoke at the Sudanese Embassy in Washington, D.C. to protest that the president of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir, had asked international aid groups bringing food, health care and water, to leave Darfur.61 While in Khartoum in August 2009, Ellison wrote a message on Twitter saying he &quot;ran straight into Pres. Omar Bashir. He has been indicted by the Inter'l Crim. Ct. (ICC) for war crimes.&quot;62
Travels abroad
Middle East
In late March and early April 2007, Ellison was a member of a congressional delegation on a &quot;fact-finding trip to the Middle East.&quot;63 The group included Representatives Henry Waxman, Tom Lantos, Louise Slaughter, Nick Rahall, Dave Hobson, who were led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The delegation visited the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Western Wall. Ellison called his visit to Islam's third-holiest site, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, as &quot;personally moving&quot;.6465 The group met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and discussed the peace plan devised by the Saudis in 2002.66 The delegation also met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
The group's visit to Syria was criticized by the Bush administration, which restated its view that the United States should not have diplomatic relations with state sponsors of terrorism.67 While there the delegation conveyed a message from Olmert to Syrian President Bashar Assad that &quot;Israel is interested in peace if Damascus stops supporting terrorism&quot;.68 In Lebanon the group met with Prime Minister Fouad Siniora and Speaker Nabih Berri. They also visited the grave of Rafik Hariri and met with his son Saad Hariri.69 In Saudi Arabia the group spoke to King Abdullah and his Shura Council of advisors.70 They praised his peace plan and advocated a greater role for women in his nation's political process. Ellison's inclusion in the delegation was praised by council member Abdul-Rahman al-Zamel.7172 Ellison called the king a &quot;visionary leader&quot; and that &quot;Even being in the same country where Mecca and Medina are located was personally uplifting for me.&quot;73 Ellison also said he hoped his presence as a Muslim among the delegation conveyed a message to the Israelis and Palestinians that &quot;people can come together. Reconciliation is possible.&quot;74
Iraq
On July 28 and 29, 2007, Ellison was among an &quot;all-freshman bipartisan congressional delegation&quot; visiting Iraq, arranged by Defense Secretary Robert Gates and led by Rep. Jerry McNerney.7576 Before the trip, Ellison told reporters that he would be stopping over in Germany to visit wounded U.S. soldiers being treated there.77 He also stated that he respected any politician who visited Iraq, making note of Republican Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty who went in February, 2007, along with five other Governors.7879 Ellison said, &quot;If this country is going to ask these young people to stand in a war zone, their political leadership should visit them.&quot;80 In Iraq the delegation met with Iraqi and U.S. military officials, including Gen. David Petraeus.
Israel and the Palestine territories
Soon after returning home from his trip to Iraq, Ellison joined with 19 other representatives on a week-long trip to Israel sponsored by the American Israel Education Foundation. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer led the group and personally invited Ellison to join them for a stay from August 12&lt;U+2013&gt;18, 2007.81 The group met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Ellison's spokesperson told reporters that the trip was &quot;a natural extension of his visit to Iraq&quot; and that &quot;the Middle East peace issue is important to the diverse communities of his Minneapolis-area district &lt;U+2014&gt; from the Jewish Community Relations Council to the patrons of the Holy Land Middle Eastern eatery on Lake Street and Central Avenue. He hears about it every time he goes back to his district.&quot; The group traveled to Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, the northern Galilee region, and Ramallah, and viewed the Israeli border with Lebanon.82
During this trip, Ellison stated that Israel did not permit him to travel to Gaza, where a conflict was occurring.83 In a 2009 interview with reporter Shihab Rattansi, Ellison expressed his disappointment at his inability to see the humanitarian situation for himself. In the same interview, he called for a more open discussion on Gaza, stating: &quot;The people who have a strong sympathy for the Israeli position... dominate the conversation. And it&lt;U+2019&gt;s really not politically safe to say, look, there are two sides to this, and Israel has not been a angel in this, and certainly there have been people on the Palestinian side who have not contributed to a constructive solution.&quot;84 
Gaza and Sderot
On February 19, 2009, Ellison and fellow Representative Brian Baird visited Gaza to view firsthand the destruction from the Gaza War and to meet with international and local relief agencies, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. This visit, which Ellison and Baird say did not have the official sanction of the Obama Administration, was the first time any U.S. government official had entered Gaza in more than three years.85 Ellison had this to say about what he saw:

The following day, Ellison and Baird visited the Israeli towns of Sderot and Ashkelon, which were the targets of numerous Qassam rocket attacks, repeatedly launched from within the Gaza strip.86
Norway
Ellison visited Norway in January 2008 in part because of Norway's prominent role in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and because of the Norwegian-American heritage of his constituents. While there, Ellison met with former Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik who is then President of the Oslo Center for Peace and Human Rights. The Star Tribune reported that the &quot;trip underscores Ellison's desire to play a role in the international peace movement.&quot;8788
Africa
In mid-2008, Ellison joined a U.S. House Democracy Assistance Commission delegation that traveled to six African countries, including Liberia, Congo, Malawi, Mauritania and Kenya. &quot;The people of the 5th Congressional District [his own] know that, in this globalized world, to have peace and security relies on other people having a modicum of peace and security,&quot; Ellison said upon returning. He attended a July 4 reception at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Nairobi, Kenya, where Ellison met Sarah Hussein Onyango Obama, the grandmother of then-presidential candidate Barack Obama.89
Advocacy for American Muslims
With his victory to the United States House of Representatives Ellison became the first Muslim elected to the Federal Government and the highest Muslim elected official in the United States, with Congressman Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Carson elected in 2008, as the only other Muslim serving in the U.S. Congress.90 Ellison&lt;U+2019&gt;s election has been seen as inspirational to American Muslims, and he encourages civic empowerment through participation in the political process.9192 Ellison generally &quot;downplayed the role of religion in his drive for office,&quot;93 but he has become active in advocacy for Muslim American civic engagement and civil rights causes on a national level since.94959697
North American Imams Federation
On November 18, 2006, Ellison gave a speech called &quot;Imams and Politics&quot; to the Fourth Annual Body Meeting of the North American Imams Federation.98 The Federation's materials presented the issues to be outlined in Ellison's speech as follows: &quot;Many Muslims around the United States are involved in political activities at different levels. Recognizing the sensitivity of political issues and the potential for divisiveness within the communities as a result of divergent political views, Imams must be able to provide Muslims with the proper guidance and educate them on the etiquettes of any political involvement within the Islamic context. Questions also arise on whether Imams and Islamic centers should be involved in politics at all and what the extent of this involvement should be, therefore Imams should have the ability to address these concerns. Overall, it is important that Imams are aware and understand the general political climate of their communities and be especially conversant with the issues that affect Muslims.&quot;99 Ellison also took part in &quot;Community Night&quot; with Imam Siraj Wahhaj, and Imam Dr. Omar Shahin. This was &quot;for Imams to meet and interact with community members.&quot;100 Some of the participants of this meeting became involved in the Flying Imams controversy after being removed from an Arizona bound plane for &quot;concerning behavior&quot;.101 Ellison became involved in this controversy shortly after it erupted when he attempted to arrange a meeting between parties including US Airways executives, the Metropolitan Airports Commission, and other legislators and community members.102
MOSES interfaith group
On December 27, Ellison spoke at a meeting in Holy Redeemer Catholic Church in Detroit for Metropolitan Organizing Strategy Enabling Strength (MOSES). The meeting was with leaders from the Catholic, Muslim, and Arab-American communities, along with members of the organized labor movement. He told those in attendance that the principles of Islam guide his life, but he has no intention of imposing his faith on others, &quot;I'm not a religious leader, I've never led religious services of any kind. I'm not here to be a preacher, but in terms of political agenda items, my faith informs me.&quot;103 He addressed the Qur'an Oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress and said that he hoped religion could be a uniting, rather than a dividing force: &quot;They've never actually tried to explore how religion should connect us, they're into how religion divides us. ... They haven't really explored ... how my faith connects me to you.&quot;104
Promoting US with the State Department
 Two months after taking office, Ellison met with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and other top State Department officials to talk about &quot;showcasing his story as part of their public diplomacy efforts in the Muslim world.&quot;105 According to the Star Tribune, Ellison was &quot;profiled three times by the State Department&lt;U+2019&gt;s overseas press bureau.&quot; He also &quot;did a Voice of America interview from his office, where an American flag was placed conspicuously behind his desk for the cameras.&quot;106 In the interview which was set to play in the Middle East and South Asia, Ellison stressed global inclusiveness and quoted verse 49:13 of the Qur'an &quot;Oh humanity, we created you from a single pair&lt;U+2026&gt;&quot;107 Ellison also accepted the Bush administrations request to be part of a &quot;teleconference with Karen Hughes, the State Department's undersecretary for public diplomacy. The White House has asked that the teleconference promote American values and confront ideological support for terrorism around the world.&quot;108 The Voice of America&lt;U+2019&gt;s Faiz Rehman, (&quot;a Pakistani native and senior political producer&quot;109) applauded Ellison's cooperation saying &quot;He is the most famous freshman congressman in the world.&quot;110
It was noted that after he took his oath of office he was surrounded by the foreign press, intrigued in part by the oath controversy, who &quot;had to be ushered out of his office after he took his oath to make room for home-state news crews.&quot;111 Ellison has been &quot;featured in a series of articles written for foreign dissemination by the Department's Bureau of International Information Programs.&quot;112 Including an article that was translated into Persian and Arabic that &quot;highlighted the diversity of his constituents in Minnesota, ranging from Swedes and Norwegians to 'the largest Somali immigrant community in America.'&quot;113 In his work in cooperation with the state department, Ellison stresses the religious freedom available in the US, saying things like &quot;religious tolerance has a much longer pedigree in America than some of the intolerance we've seen lately.&quot;114 Even in his work with the State Department he remained critical of President Bush's Iraq policy saying &quot;he wants people around the world to know that 'there are many Americans who want to relate to the rest of the world in terms of cooperation, not military domination.'&quot;115 Ellison staffers told reporters that &quot;the State Department has shown no signs of squeamishness about publicizing his criticism of the war.&quot;116 When asked about working with elements of the Bush administration Ellison said &quot;Hey, my country first. We can work out our political differences later. I've said I'm willing to do whatever I can to make some friends for America.&quot;117
Issues and controversies
Qur'an oath of office

 Because Ellison stated an intent to use the Qur'an instead of a Bible at his photo-op reenactment of the swearing in ceremony (the official ceremony is done en masse without any books), conservative columnist Dennis Prager wrote a column criticizing his decision.118 This drew responses from organizations such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the American Family Association, and the Anti-Defamation League.
Representative Virgil Goode of Virginia, responding to &quot;scores and hundreds of emails&quot;119 from his constituents after the Prager articles, has also stated his view that Ellison's decision to use the Qur'an is a threat to &quot;the values and beliefs traditional to the United States of America&quot;.120 He also wrote, &quot;...if American citizens don&lt;U+2019&gt;t wake up and adopt the Virgil Goode position on immigration there will likely be many more Muslims elected to office and demanding the use of the Qur'an.&quot;
CNN reported that on the opening day of Congress, Ellison met Goode on the House floor to shake hands and Goode accepted an offer to talk over coffee.121 That same day during his oath reenactment, Ellison used a two volume Qur'an once owned by Thomas Jefferson122 and loaned to Ellison by &quot;the rare book and special collections division at the Library of Congress&quot;; coincidentally, Jefferson's home at Monticello was actually located in Goode's district.123 According to Ellison, &quot;it demonstrates that from the very beginning of our country, we had people who were visionary, who were religiously tolerant, who believed that knowledge and wisdom could be gleaned from any number of sources, including the Qur'an.&quot;124 Historian Kevin J. Hayes in his article How Thomas Jefferson Read the Qur'an explained that Jefferson purchased the book in 1765 while studying for the bar exam to become a lawyer.125
President Barack Obama in an address to nations with a majority Muslim population made in Cairo, Egypt on June 4, 2009 cited this event as an example of the continual positive impact Muslims have had on America, saying, &quot;And when the first Muslim-American was recently elected to Congress, he took the oath to defend our Constitution using the same Holy Qur'an that one of our Founding Fathers&lt;U+2014&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;U+2014&gt;kept in his personal library.&quot;126
Interview with Glenn Beck
On November 14, 2006, Glenn Beck of CNN Headline News127 said to Ellison, &quot;I have been nervous about this interview with you, because what I feel like saying is, 'Sir, prove to me that you are not working with our enemies.' And I know you're not. I'm not accusing you of being an enemy, but that's the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way.&quot; Ellison replied that his constituents, &quot;know that I have a deep love and affection for my country. There's no one who's more patriotic than I am, and so you know, I don't need to &lt;U+2014&gt; need to prove my patriotic stripes.&quot;
When asked by Beck about his opinion on &quot;Muslim extremists&quot; Ellison replied, &quot;They're criminals. But I think that people who commit criminal acts should be treated like criminals, regardless of their faith.&quot;128 Ellison has also said, &quot;Osama bin Laden no more represents Islam than Timothy McVeigh represented Christianity.&quot;129 Asked about the incident later, Ellison dismissed it, &quot;It's just shock TV. Some pundits think they have to ask the most outrageous questions.&quot;130
On January 2, 2007, Beck said on his radio program that Ellison did not take offense at the comments and the two had a friendly chat off the air. On January 9, 2007, at the Television Critics Association's semiannual press tour, Beck said it was &quot;Quite possibly the poorest-worded question of all time.&quot; He clarified by saying, &quot;My point to Keith Ellison... is the same point that I make to my own faith, and that is &lt;U+2014&gt; you must stand up before things get out of control ... And it's important for people of all faiths, when someone is hijacking their religion, to stand and say, 'That is not what we do. That is not who we are.&quot;' 131
Louis Farrakhan and history with the Nation of Islam
As a law student in 1989 and 1990, Ellison wrote several columns under the name &quot;Keith E. Hakim&quot; in the student newspaper, the Minnesota Daily. Washington Post Staff Writer Alan Cooperman characterized Ellison's articles saying that he &quot;defended Farrakhan against accusations of anti-semitism,&quot; and that Ellison &quot;called affirmative action a 'sneaky' form of compensation for slavery, suggesting instead that white Americans pay reparations to blacks.&quot; 132133134
Minnesota Republican operatives135136 raised questions during Ellison's 2006 campaign about the articles and his involvement with the Nation of Islam. In response, Ellison wrote a letter to the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota &amp; the Dakotas asserting he was never a member, and that his connections with the Nation of Islam were limited to an 18-month period to help organize the Minnesota contingent to the Million Man March in 1995.137138139 In Ellison's letter, he denounced the Nation of Islam and Farrakhan, writing &quot;I wrongly dismissed concerns that they [Farrakhan's remarks] were anti-semitic. They were and are anti-semitic and I should have come to that conclusion earlier than I did.&quot;140 He explained his previous views, saying that he, &quot;did not adequately scrutinize the positions and statements of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, and Khalid Muhammed.&quot; He also stated that &quot;any kind of discrimination and hate are wrong. This has always been my position&quot;. During the 2006 campaign, many prominent Jewish DFL activists supported Ellison, including fundraisers Samuel and Sylvia Kaplan, and State Representative Phyllis Kahn, who said it was &quot;inconceivable that he could have ever been an anti-Semite.&quot;141
Campaign contributions from members of CAIR
During the 2006 election Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and James Yee, the former Muslim chaplain at Guantanamo Bay, spoke at an August 25 fundraiser for Ellison.142143 Awad and Ellison knew each other as they attended the University of Minnesota Law School at the same time.144145 According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Ellison accepted individual contributions from Nihad Awad and another leader of CAIR; Ellison responded that he had fully disclosed all contributions and asserted that he had &quot;nothing to hide&quot;.146 Ellison stressed that he was supported by individuals, and that the non-profit organization itself did not endorse his candidacy.147
His Republican opponent in the race, Alan Fine, criticized Ellison for accepting these contributions, asserting that CAIR was &quot;a group that Democrats say has deep ties to terrorism&quot;.148 In response to Ellison's opponents, CAIR leaders Parvez Ahmed and Nihad Awad wrote &quot;We are proud of our personal donations to Ellison's campaign&quot; and derided any 'guilt by association' arguments.149
Campaign finance violations
In early 2006, the Minnesota State Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board reprimanded Ellison for unreported campaign contributions, discrepancies in cash balances, and misclassified disbursements during his campaigns for the Minnesota House of Representatives. These transgressions occurred in the years 2002&lt;U+2013&gt;2004. In 2005, the board opened an investigation, and Ellison was subpoenaed and fined.150151
Ellison was repeatedly fined for late filings,152 was sued twice by the Attorney General of Minnesota, and warned about absent or incomplete disclosures.153154155156
Reichstag fire and 9/11
On July 8, 2007, Ellison discussed the power of the executive branch in the US currently in a speech before the organization Atheists for Human Rights. He stated that Dick Cheney asserts it is &quot;beneath his dignity in order for him to answer any questions from the citizens of the United States. That is the very definition of totalitarianism, authoritarianism and dictatorship.&quot;157 He went on to say, &quot;It's almost like the Reichstag fire, kind of reminds me of that. After the Reichstag was burned, they blamed the Communists for it and it put the leader of that country Hitler in a position where he could basically have authority to do whatever he wanted. The fact is that I'm not saying September 11 was a U.S. plan, or anything like that because, you know, that's how they put you in the nut-ball box &lt;U+2014&gt; dismiss you.&quot;158
Fox News picked up the story159 and their commentator John Gibson categorized Ellison's comments as accusing &quot;Bush of planning and executing the 9/11 attacks&quot;.160 In Congress, Representatives Eric Cantor and Zach Wamp wrote House Speaker Nancy Pelosi demanding she &quot;swiftly and immediately&quot; reprimand Ellison for his remarks.161 The letter said &quot;Even if Ellison asserts that he was not implying that 9/11 was orchestrated by the administration, the comparison he draws between Hitler and the President of United States is disgraceful. These comments inflame hatred and division at a time when we should be promoting our unity and reconciliation.&quot;162163 The Anti-Defamation League also stated &quot;Whatever his views may be on the administration's response to 9/11 and the conduct of the war on terrorism, likening it to Hitler's rise to power and Nazism is odious and demeans the victims of 9/11 and the brave American men and women engaged in the war on terror. Furthermore, it demonstrates a profound lack of understanding about the horrors that Hitler and his Nazi regime perpetrated.&quot;164
When later questioned about his comments, Ellison told a reporter that Osama bin Laden, and not the Bush administration, was responsible for the attacks.165 Ellison also said, &quot;In the aftermath of a tragedy, space is opened up for governments to take action that they could not have achieved before that.&quot; He pointed to the Iraq War and provisions granting greater arrest and surveillance powers within the USA PATRIOT Act as examples.166 Ellison said also &quot;In response to a question, I stated that the Bush Administration exploited post-9/11 fears to advance a policy agenda that has undermined our civil liberties. I stand by this statement. ...I want to be clear that the murderous Nazi regime is historically distinct and the horror of the Holocaust must be acknowledged as a unique event in human history. I did not intend any direct comparison between the totalitarian state of Nazi Germany and the current administration. I have taken consistent and strong stands against Holocaust denial throughout my life in public service.&quot;167
Sali remarks
Representative Bill Sali, drew criticism for his comments in an August 8, 2007 interview with the conservative Christian-based American Family News Network. Sali, an outspoken Evangelical Christian, denounced the Senate leadership for allowing a Hindu to lead the opening prayer. He held that invoking a non-Christian god in the Senate threatened to endanger America by removing &quot;the protective hand of God.&quot;168 He then went on to say &quot;We have not only a Hindu prayer being offered in the Senate, we have a Muslim member of the House of Representatives now, Keith Ellison from Minnesota. Those are changes and they are not what was envisioned by the Founding Fathers. The principles that this country was built on, that have made it great over these centuries, were Christian principles derived from Scripture. You know the Lord can make the rain fall on the just and the unjust alike.&quot;
Former Idaho Democratic congressman Richard Stallings, among others, demanded that Sali either apologize or resign. In response Sali sent Ellison an e-mail saying he &quot;meant no offense.&quot;169 At the time Ellison was in Iraq with a congressional delegation, his spokesperson said &quot;The congressman just doesn't respond to comments like that.&quot;170 Sali stressed to reporters that he was not calling for Ellison to be removed, &quot;He got elected the same way I did. People certainly have the right to elect anyone they want.&quot;171 Sali defended his claim about America's founding principles, saying, &quot;The idea that somehow we can move to multiculturalism and still remain the same &lt;U+2014&gt; I think that's a little dangerous, too. From my standpoint, I believe the Founding Fathers were overwhelmingly Christian and the God they were talking about is the God of the Bible.&quot;172 When asked about his policy discussions with those of other faiths he stated, &quot;I would say, 'These are principles that I think are important,' and if he agrees with those, great. At the end of the game, maybe it does get down to religious beliefs and how they impact how you make public policy.&quot;173 It has been noted in a New York Sun editorial that claims dogging Ellison that the founders of the US did not anticipate Muslim legislators are incorrect.174 The specific subject was brought up in many of the State conventions to ratify the Constitution, including remarks by William Lancaster in the North Carolina Ratifying Convention in 1788.175176
Awards
Ellison was chosen by the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee for its Trailblazer Award. The group said Ellison &quot;has established a career of advocacy focused on promoting civil and human rights, peace, and prosperity for working families.&quot;177 He was named an Utne Reader visionary in 2011.178
