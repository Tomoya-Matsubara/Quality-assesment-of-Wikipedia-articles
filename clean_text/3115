John Tresadern (born September 26, 1890 in Leytonstone, died December 26, 1959 in Tonbridge) was an English professional footballer and football manager. He played twice for the England national side.
Playing career
Jack Tresadern, a left-half, began his career with non-league Wanstead, moving on to Barking Town before joining West Ham United in July 1913. He was part of the West Ham side elected to the Football League in 1919 and became a regular in their league side. Tresadern made his England debut in April 1923, in the 2-2 Home International draw with Scotland. His only other appearance for England came the following month against Sweden in Stockholm. The same year, he was part of the West Ham side that lost to Bolton Wanderers in the first ever FA Cup final to be held at Wembley.
In October 1924, after 144 league games for the Hammers, Tresadern moved to Burnley. However, he played just 22 league games for Burnley before joining Northampton Town as player-manager in May 1925.
Coaching and managerial career
Tresadern retired from playing in December 1926 after breaking his leg. He continued as manager of Northampton until October 1930 when he became manager of Crystal Palace. In June 1935 he left Palace to manage Tottenham Hotspur, but had little success at White Hart Lane, resigning to take over at Plymouth Argyle in April 1938 rather than wait to be sacked. The war interrupted his time at Plymouth, but he remained at Home Park until November 1947.
The following year he became a scout for Aston Villa before becoming manager of Chelmsford City in June 1949. He left Chelsmford in November 1950 and in December 1951 became manager of Hastings United.
He became manager of Tonbridge in April 1958 and remained in post until his death in December 1959 at the age of 69.
