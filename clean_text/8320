is a Japanese adult visual novel developed by Petit Ferret with character designs by Akio Watanabe under the alias Poyoyon&lt;U+2661&gt;Rock. It was originally released as a PC game for CD-ROM on December 13, 2002 and subsequently re-released on DVD-ROM and for PlayStation 2 (PS2) with the latter removing some of the adult content. A fan disc for Popotan by Petit Ferret was also released shortly before the DVD-ROM re-release.
The gameplay in Popotan follows a semi-predetermined plot; major events are the same, however, as the game progresses the storylines eventually diverges quite dramatically. The game focuses mostly on the three sisters and it is necessary to finish at least their scenarios before the player can pursue the other girls. Beyond that, the main goal is to make available sexual scenes and images that the player can view or replay at any time depicting the protagonist having sexual intercourse with one of the girls.
Popotan has made the transition into other media as well. A novel series based off the visual novel entitled  by Sassami Yachiruda was published by Softgarage; the novels were released in two volumes on June 20 and August 22, 2002. On May 7, 2003 Magazine Z announced it would publish a Popotan manga series by Y&lt;U+016B&gt;jiro Izumi1 whose story would revolve around the three sisters.2 There was also a twelve episode anime directed by Shinichiro Kimura that originally aired on Tokyo Broadcasting System from July 17 through October 2, 2003. The anime was licensed in North America by Geneon USA until Geneon folded in 2008. A radio drama  was also produced between April and December 2003 and broadcast over Osaka Radio's and TBS Radio's networks and later put on CD. Several art and reference books were released by the franchise as well as other less notable media.
The title, Popotan, is meant to reflect the prominence of dandelions, spelled  in Japanese,3 in the game; &quot;Popotan&quot; is a nonsensical word and is like literally saying &quot;liondandy&quot;.456 It also uses the flipped &quot;-tan&quot; to call the dandelions by name.7
Gameplay
 Most of Popotan's gameplay requires little interaction from the player since a majority of the time is spent reading the text that appears on the game's screen, which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. After progressing through the text, the players will either come to a &quot;decision point&quot; where they must choose from multiple options or the text will end and the player must either move to a new location8 or, in the DVD-ROM and PS2 versions, continue on to the next event through a shortcut option.91011 The time between these points varies. Gameplay pauses at these points and, depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress and may branch off in a specific direction,12 though pursuing anyone beyond the three sisters requires at least one of the latter's scenarios to have been successfully completed. After completing Ai's scenario the player unlocks a new scenario with Unagi.131415 The PS2 port added new events and scenes to the original1617 to replace some of the content that was removed. While text is on the screen the player has the option to save the game, however, when there is none the player is unable to save on the PC versions of the game.181920 With the PS2 port, this limitation was removed.21
At certain points along Mii's scenario a special music mini-game will commence. The goal of the mini-game is to max out &quot;Magical Girl Mii&quot;'s magical power meter by hitting balls at the right moment.22 Succeeding or failing the mini-game does not have a major impact on the plot, though it does have an immediate affect upon the scene. After successfully completing Mii's scenario, an omake option will become available on the main menu. This allows the player to play the mini-game based upon various music tracks from the game.232425
Popotan uses over one-thousand two-dimensional computer graphics for backgrounds, events and character poses to engage the player. While only the mouths and eyes are animated, the number of poses is quite large and most minor characters were given the similar treatment as major characters,262728 though with fewer major poses to cut costs.29 In addition, the game regularly and actively uses a character placement on screen to display relative position of the characters in relation to the protagonist, including moving them enlarging or shrinking the images to show distance being closer or further away respectively.303132
Plot
Setting and themes
Popotan takes place sometime in the distant future, though the exact location is unclear because enough time has passed to transform the area. A giant dandelion structure which acts as a spire pierced the city atop a hill some time ago destroying much of city, though it has recovered by time the game starts. The main location of the game is a European-styled mansion which is seen as completely out-of-place in the city. While it is the central storyline location, much of the daytime is spent outside the mansion wandering around town attempting to meet characters to trigger event sequences.333435
As indicated by the title, flowers, specifically dandelions, as well as vegetation in general, is a major theme in the game. Various sculptures and buildings were drawn with a flower motif in mind. Every outdoor and some indoor scenes have vegetation of some type in it. In addition, those that do not have any vegetation have something representing it in them.363738
Characters

The player assumes the role of Chris, the protagonist of Popotan. He is a high school dropout who decided not to get a job because he's turned his back on society. He did this because he said he saw the direction it was heading and didn't like it. Because of this, he has been wandering for some time on the streets now making a living, what little he can, by playing the guitar. generally does not feel up to it without an audience and being a drifter makes that hard.39 As the game starts, he is wandering around and happens upon a mansion where he meets three sisters and their maid. Ai is the eldest of the three sisters. She acts a motherly figure for the other two. She has the ability to speak to plants. Mai is the middle sister. She acts very tomboyish and does not really like Chris staying with them at first. Mii is the youngest and by far the most energetic. She often cosplays as &quot;Magical Girl Mii&quot;. Mea, their maid, comes off as emotionless at first, but as the game progresses she is shown to have a depth to her. Chris decides to stay with them40 as they have cheap rent and he has very little money, though he quickly learns if he is to stay he'll have to change his ways.414243
Story
Popotan's story involves Chris's change in lifestyle. In some scenarios, the mysteries surrounding the large hill with the spire-like object are also explored. Chris is a slacker from out of town who roams around the town doing just enough to get by.44 The story opens sometime in the future with Chris near a food stand by a shrine entrance without money and desperate enough to consider stealing food to just to survive. After this fails he wanders around town looking for someplace to work enough to feed himself and provide shelter. He finds a local convenience store where he gets directions which eventually lead him to the girls. He then continues to wander around town as he has no place else to go and hardly any money. When he arrives, he invites himself into the mansion and runs into the three sisters and their human-looking android maid. Chris decides to stay after finding out that the place was nice, the rent was cheap and he'd be staying under the same roof as four pretty girls as the only guy; upon learning his intentions about finding a place to stay, the girls agree to let him stay.45464748
However, the following day he learns he will not be able to continue his slacker lifestyle if he wants to remain and is forced to take a part time job. The owner of the market who gave him directions agrees to hire him.49 As the story progresses, Chris opens up as he interacts with the girls and other people he meets. The story revolves around his change in attitude - he begins to care about people.505152

Additional graphics and better gameplay were added to compensate for the removal of some of the content, especially those dealing with Mii.6970 Petite Ferret also released a fan disc for the game on July 11, 2003, shortly before the DVD-ROM release entitled .
The initial release of the CD-ROM version of Popotan had several critical errors including the inability to get certain girls when following their path correctly and contained severe memory-related problems as well. These issues were quickly resolved with a hotfix on January 10, 2003.71 Future versions of the game were released without such problems.
The initial release of Popotan Fan Disc together with A&lt;U+30FB&gt;SO&lt;U+30FB&gt;BO72 also had some issues. Although not as critical as those their parent product contained, they were nonetheless serious. Petit Ferret addressed these issues in two separate patches. The first patch adds missing voice data from the original CD that was intended for the game. The company offered to exchange existing CDs if a customer wanted to send their product in or they could download the necessary files from the website. On July 7, 2003 the company released a final patch for the game which includes grammatical corrections, difficulty fixes and overall stability enhancements. The second patch did not contain the fixes from the first.73

The series is very episodic83 with each episode in the series, especially the first four, focuses on one of the four main characters of the anime.848586 This allows them to show better how each of them deals with making friends and then leaving them abruptly. While the theme of focusing on an individual character remains throughout the whole series, a twist is added in that since they move forward in time, they meet up with the same people, only older, or their children and the complications that brings due to not aging.8788
Popotan has been hard to classify as it defies any real genre or sub-genre with numerous exceptions to it. Although the anime has an overall comedic tone, the amount varies depending upon whom the episode centers around. It is an enigma as to what audience the anime was intended for as there is periodic nudity in many episodes,8990 though no sexually explicit scenes occur on camera.91 In addition, the characters are very light-hearted wanting to help those they meet.92 Geneon placed an age rating on the series of 16+ because of the nudity and language.93
During the release of the Volume 3 of the Japanese DVD release a misprint on the DVD's jacket numbering the episodes incorrectly. Bandai Visual offered free exchanges of the jackets to those who wanted them.94

While the sisters eventually meet Shizaku,113 the story ends with a continuation of them traveling in the mansion114115 leaving unanswered questions as to their final destination, if any, and why they were chosen.116
Their bodies are connected to the mansion where they live, which is also the vehicle that allows them to travel through time.117 When they are outside the mansion, their bodies cease to age, to the point where even their hair stops growing. When they travel through time in their mansion, they jump five years into the future, and with one exception, never ends up in the same place. The one exception is when the party is split, presumably because it needed everyone together.118119 As they travel through time, meet and leave friends they make,120 they are eventually given a decision by Shizaku to determine whether they will stay in the era they like most or continue on their journey together.121122

Reception and sales

All of the Popotan visual novels released by Petit Ferret sold initially quite well. According to a national rating of bish&lt;U+014D&gt;jo games by PCNews, an online Japanese news site, the initial CD-ROM release of Popotan was ninth approximately one-and-a-half months after its release157 and stayed on the charts half-a-month longer at twenty-first.158 It reappeared briefly six months after the initial release at a ranking of forty-sixth159 shortly before the fan disc was released. The DVD-ROM re-release was listed as twenty-fourth in overall sales one month after its release.160 When the fan disc was released, it was listed as the eleventh among the most sold bish&lt;U+014D&gt;jo game's within one month after its release.161 The PS2 port, Oshiete! Popotan, received an aggregate score rating of 5.5 / 10 when it was released.162
Anime
When the first English DVD was released in the US, Popotan got mixed reviews. Anime Jump gave it 1 and a 1/2 stars after stating that beyond the pretty pictures, &quot;it is created specifically to sell DVDs, tiny figurines, and other merchandise to introverted adult men.&quot;163 DVDtalk gave it a final rating of &quot;recommended&quot; with the only real criticism being the DVD's extras. The reviewer remarked that the first disc &quot;[...]was full of surprises for even a jaded old reviewer like myself.&quot;164
Although the series has negative criticism, particularly from those who only reviewed the first DVD, those who have reviewed the series as a whole have taken a much more favorable stance,165166 with Allmovie going so far as to give it 4/5 stars167 and DVDtalk giving &quot;recommended&quot; to the first two discs and the series as a whole. Several reviewers have also praised the inability to easily classify Popotan into a specific genre or category of anime.168169170171
The level of nudity and it's relation to the storyline has been widely contested. While Animetric and Mania have contended it is excessive,172173 DVDtalk has mixed reviews on it with one claiming the scenes were out-of-place174 while another stated the nudity was fine and appropriate.175176. Both of the latter agree though that the amount was minor.177178179
The character designs by Akio Watanabe and animation in general have been praised even by those who otherwise criticize the series,180181 with Animetric.com claiming &quot;[c]haracter designs are glossy and distinctive, while scenes are detailed nicely and brightly rendered&quot;. The series musical score has also been well received being likened by Animetric.com as &quot;cutesy&quot; and &quot;...complementing the series perfectly.&quot;182
