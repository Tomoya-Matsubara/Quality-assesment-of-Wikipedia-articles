Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, commented on the lyrical content of the song, stating that: &quot;For believers, in context with our other songs, the messages are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants you to have a purpose&quot;.15 Hall elaborated that: &quot;There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. [&quot;Until the Whole World Hears&quot;], &lt;U+201C&gt;Glorious Day,&lt;U+201D&gt; and &lt;U+201C&gt;To Know You.&lt;U+201D&gt; [&quot;Until the Whole World Hears&quot;] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I may not be able to get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family.&quot;16 The portion of the chorus that says &quot;like voices in the wilderness we're crying out&quot; is a reference to John the Baptist;17 Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that &quot;he [John the Baptist] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life&quot;.18 He elaborated on that, commenting that: &quot;Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had&quot;.19
