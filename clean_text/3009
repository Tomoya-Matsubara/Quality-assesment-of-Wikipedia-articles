 This is a list of Ashes cricket series played between Australia and England. Most Ashes series have consisted of five Test matches between the two countries. The Ashes series with the fewest Test matches was the 1887-88 Ashes series, consisting of only one Test. The seven Test match 1970-71 Ashes series was the Ashes series with the most Test matches. The first Ashes series was held in Australia, and since then the hosting of the Ashes series has been shared between Australia and England.
The Ashes is a fiercely contested competition. England won the first eight Ashes series in a row, and only lost one Ashes series in the first twelve. Australia then won four series in a row, before England reclaimed the Ashes in the 1926 Ashes series. The Ashes series after 1934 has been dominated by Australia. After 1934, Australia have held the Ashes for long periods of time, including from 1934 to 1953, from 1959 to 1971 and from 1989 to 2005. The longest period of time that England has held the Ashes after 1934 was from 1953 to 1959.
Australia currently holds the Ashes after regaining them on 18 December 2006, when it took an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five test 2006-07 Ashes series. England has previously disrupted Australia's 16 year reign by defeating them in the 2005 Ashes series. Overall, the Australians have won 31 Ashes series, England have won 28 Ashes series and there have been 5 drawn Ashes series. A total of 64 Ashes series have been played. The next Ashes series will be played in England in 2009.

* Ashes



Matches played prior to the 1882-83 series, including the 1882 Oval match are not considered to be part of The Ashes series. A fourth match in the 1882-83 series played against a &quot;United Australian XI&quot; was also not considered to be an Ashes Test.↩
The scheduled 3rd Test at Manchester in 1890 was abandoned without a ball being bowled, due to rain. This was the first test match where this occurred.↩
The &quot;1912 Triangular Tournament&quot; including Australia, England and South Africa. Only Australia v England results shown.↩
&quot;Bodyline&quot; series↩
In an exact repeat of 1890, the scheduled 3rd test at Manchester in 1938 was abandoned without a ball being bowled, due to rain.↩
Just after the Second World War had ended in Europe, Lindsay Hassett captained an Australian Services team in five &quot;Victory Tests&quot; in England against England. The &quot;Victory Tests&quot; have not, however, been granted full Test status.↩
&quot;Invincibles&quot; series↩
The scheduled third test at Melbourne in 1970-71 was abandoned without a ball being bowled, due to rain washing out the first three days. The ICC does not recognise this as a test match, however the match is statistically recognised by Cricket Australia, as a coin toss took place. (The abandoned match is not included in these statistics). As a sidenote, in order to satisfy a disappointed audience, a limited over, one-day match was hastily arranged for 5 Jan 1971. This is now recognised as the first One-day International cricket match.↩
The 1976-77 MCC tour of Australia for the first Centenary Test, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground is not considered an Ashes Test.↩
The 1979-80 three-Test England tour of Australia series was the outcome of a deal between the ACB and World Series Cricket to bring WSC to an end. England agreed to the tour on condition the matches did not have Ashes status. Accordingly they are excluded from the results above.↩
The 1980 Australian tour of England for the second Centenary Test, at Lord's is not considered an Ashes Test.↩
Commonly referred to as &quot;Botham's Ashes&quot; or similar — Wisden 1982 called it &quot;Botham's summer&quot;; BBC claims it's &quot;universally known&quot; as &quot;Botham's Ashes&quot;; John Stern says &quot;the video of the series is often called Botham's Ashes and rightly so.&quot;↩
The 1987-88 England tour of Australia for a single Test celebrating the Australian Bicentenary at the Sydney Cricket Ground is not considered an Ashes Test.↩
