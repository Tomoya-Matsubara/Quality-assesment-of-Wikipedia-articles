Abel Eduardo Balbo  (born June 1, 1966, in Empalme Villa Constituci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, Santa Fe) is a former Argentine football striker, the all-time leading foreign goalscorer in Italy's Serie A.
On the club level, Balbo played for Newell's Old Boys (1987-88), River Plate (1988-89), before moving to Italy and Udinese (1989-93), Roma (1993-98 and 2000-02), Parma (1998-99), and Fiorentina. He played four games for Boca Juniors before finally retiring. He scored a total of 138 goals in Serie A; his best seasons came in 1990-91 for Udiense and 1994-95 for Roma, with 22 goals in each of them.
For Argentina, Balbo scored 11 goals in 37 caps, and played at the 1990, the 1994, the 1998 FIFA World Cups, the 1989 and 1995 Copas Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica. At the 1995 tournament in Uruguay, Balbo partnered Gabriel Batistuta in attack, and scored a goal against Brazil's Claudio Taffarel in a quarterfinal game that Argentina lost in a penalty shootout after Brazilian striker Tulio Costa famously scored the equalizer with 10 minutes remaining in the match after clearly controlling the ball with his arm.
After his retirement, Balbo eventually became a musician by performing songs in Italian and Spanish.
