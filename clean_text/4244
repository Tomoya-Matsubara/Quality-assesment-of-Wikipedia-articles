The 1929&lt;U+2013&gt;30 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain was the fourth Kangaroo tour, and took the Australia national rugby league team all around England and also into Wales. The tour also featured the ninth Ashes series which comprised four Test matches and was won by Great Britain. The team sailed on the SS Orsova via the Panama Canal and played an exhibition game in New York before arriving in England.

1st Test
In the tour matches leading up to the first Test, the Australian team had defeated Rochdale (36-3), York (32-11), Batley (27-5), Widnes (37-13) and Broughton (21-8).7 The English team was weakened by the absence of their usual captain, Jonty Parkin (who was suffering from lower back pain), as well as Brough and Ellaby

It was a freezing afternoon for the deciding test, which Australia dominated yet was still unable to put points on the board.10 With only a few minutes remaining and the scores locked at nil-all in the third and deciding test, Busch collected the ball from a scrum win 30 metres out and scooted down the sideline. He crashed over the try-line in the corner with England's loose forward Butters on his back making a last-ditch attempt to stop him. As the corner post went flying the crowd spilled onto the field in excitement. Referee Bob Robinson looked set to award Australia the try and the game (and with it the Ashes) when the touch-judge Albert Webster emerged through the crowd claiming Busch had taken out the corner post before grounding the ball. Even though the referee believed it was a fair try he had no option other than to rule 'no try'. The referee was reported to have said to the Kangaroos &quot;fair try Australia, but I am overruled&quot;. The match finished as a 0-0 draw, leaving the series tied at one match apiece. For the remainder of his life Busch insisted he scored the try, quoted as saying &quot;I got it down all right&lt;U+2026&gt;it was a fair try.&quot;11 The corner where Busch scored the disallowed try in Swinton, is still officially known as Busch&lt;U+2019&gt;s Corner.12 {{-}}
4th Test
After much deliberation the controversial decision was made to play a fourth Test a week later. This was the first and only time that a fourth test has been played on any Kangaroo tour.13

In this match Cec Fifield broke his ankle and was unable to play the remainder of the tour. In an enthralling and especially brutal match, the deadlock was only broken by Stan Smith's solitary unconverted try so England won 3-0, to retain the Ashes.14 {{-}}
