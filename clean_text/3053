Andrew Stuart Murray McCall (born 10 June 1964), usually known as Stuart McCall, is a former Scottish footballer who played in central midfield. He is now a football manager, in charge of League Two side Bradford City.
He started his professional career with Bradford City, where he made his senior debut in 1982. He played six seasons at Valley Parade, during which time he won the Division Three championship, a title which was overshadowed by the Bradford fire disaster when 56 people died and in which his father Andy was injured. After missing out on promotion in 1987–88 he moved to Everton, for whom he scored twice but finished on the losing side in the 1989 FA Cup Final. In 1991 he moved to Rangers, with whom he spent seven seasons and won six league titles, three Scottish Cups and two Scottish League Cups. He returned to Bradford City as captain to take them into the top division of English football for the first time in 77 years. After four seasons he moved to Sheffield United, where he retired as a player in 2005. McCall also won 40 caps for Scotland and scored one goal in the 1990 World Cup in Italy. He played in two European Championships but his international career ended after he was left out of the 1998 World Cup squad.
He was part of the coaching staff during his second spell at Bradford City, briefly serving as caretaker/player manager in 2000. He continued his coaching at Sheffield United and was assistant manager to Neil Warnock until May 2007, when he returned to Bradford City for a third time, this time as manager on 1 June 2007.
Early life
Stuart McCall was born on 10 June 1964 in Leeds, England, to Scottish parents Andy, a former professional footballer, and Jean McCall.1 He was the couple's third child after Leslie and Janette, who were 20 and 15 respectively when Stuart was born.2 The family home was just round the corner from Leeds United's Elland Road ground where McCall would spend many Saturday afternoons watching United, dreaming of following his father and playing for Leeds, even after the family moved to Wortley.34 McCall played football for Upper Wortley Primary School and Thornhill Middle School, even scoring a winning goal for the latter in a cup final when he came on as a substitute with his arm in a sling.5 McCall also played table tennis as a schoolboy but excelled at football, captaining the Leeds under-11 boys team and playing for other Leeds representative sides.6 McCall's parents split and he made up for his size when he moved to one of Leeds' toughest estates and played for pub sides by the age of 14.7 He moved schools to Harrington High and also played for local young sides Pudsey Juniors, Holbeck and later Farsley Celtic.8 McCall thought he had missed his chance of playing professionally after a string of other players were signed by professional clubs, until Farsley played Bradford City's junior side in a friendly and he impressed coach Bryan Edwards enough to be asked for a trial.9
Club career
Bradford City
McCall came through City's youth system after he was signed by George Mulhall in 1980 from Farsley Celtic at the age of 16,1011 before becoming an apprentice in June 1981.1213 Mulhall's successor, Roy McFarland gave McCall his debut at Reading on 28 August 1982—the opening day of the 1982–83 season—when he deputised for Ces Podd at right back.14 He had played just six league games by 29 January 1983 when he made the first of 134 consecutive league appearances, all in midfield under new manager Trevor Cherry.15 City finished 12th in Division Three that season.16 The following season City struggled to make up for the absence of Bobby Campbell, who had left to join Derby County, and won just one of their first fifteen games,17 until Cherry bought Campbell back from Derby, and City won a record ten consecutive games on their way to a seventh place finish.18
During the summer of 1984, Cherry made the two key signings of central defender Dave Evans and right winger John Hendrie to build on the previous season's high finish.19 McCall was an integral part of the team as City won the Division Three championship in 1984–85, during which he scored eight goals as one of two ever-present players.20 The title was assured in the penultimate game when McCall scored the second goal in a 2–0 victory over Bolton Wanderers.2122 The league title was paraded before the final game of the season on 11 May 1985 at home to Lincoln City. However, the club's title was overshadowed when 56 people died in the Bradford City disaster when the Valley Parade ground's main stand caught fire after 40 minutes of play, during which McCall's father, who was with other family members, was badly injured.23 After the fire, McCall, still in his kit, spent several hours driving from the ground to his sister's house, then to Bradford Royal Infirmary and Pinderfields Hospital trying to find his father.24 His father had suffered severe burns and needed skin grafts on his hands and head and was in hospital for several weeks.25
For the following 19 months, the club played games away from Valley Parade. Cherry and the players became a close-knit team, attending funerals of the victims and other engagements in the months that followed, and the club's 13th place finish in Division Two in 1985–86 was hailed a major achievement.26 During Bradford's time away from Valley Parade, McCall also turned his back on Leeds United, the team he had supported as a child, after their fans set fire to a chip van at Odsal Stadium.27 McCall became club captain in November 1986, aged just 21, after Peter Jackson moved to Newcastle United.28 Under Cherry's replacement, Terry Dolan, the club held off any relegation threats to finish tenth in 1986–87. Like Jackson, McCall and Hendrie were both keen to move to a Division One club, but they agreed in 1987 to stay for one final season.29
Dolan brought in Paul Tomlinson, Brian Mitchell and Lee Sinnott in a bid to help McCall and Hendrie realise their dreams with City.30 They mounted a promotion challenge in 1987–88 and were top for much of the season until they faltered in the New Year. When promotion was missed initially by one point on the last day of the season after a 3–2 defeat against Ipswich Town and then through play-off defeat to Middlesbrough, McCall left the club, signing for Everton for &lt;U+00A3&gt;850,000 in June 1988.31 He had played 238 league games for the club, scoring 37 goals, and in total played 285 games, scoring 46 goals. McCall was later outspoken in his autobiography, The Real McCall, about City's failure to strengthen the side in order to secure promotion.32

His departure was soured when he was forced to go to the Football League with a Professional Footballers' Association representative to win &lt;U+00A3&gt;8,327.15 of an unpaid signing-on fee.3334
Everton
McCall joined Everton at a time when its former triumphant side of the mid 1980s had broken up, following the ban on English sides competing in Europe, which marked the start of a period of underachievement at Goodison Park.3536 His Everton debut came in a 4–0 victory over Newcastle United on 27 August 1988 against his former teammate Hendrie, who was making his debut for Newcastle.37 McCall also returned to Valley Parade for a League Cup tie, but his Everton side were knocked out by Bradford 3–1 on 14 December 1988.38 He started 29 league games in 1988–89 as well as another four substitute appearances. He was also a substitute in the 1989 FA Cup Final when he scored Everton's equaliser in the Merseyside derby against Liverpool to take the game into extra-time. He scored another equaliser during extra-time, but Liverpool's own substitute Ian Rush also scored two to secure a 3–2 victory for Liverpool.39
McCall made a second appearance in an Everton shirt at Valley Parade, when he was invited by former teammate Mark Ellis to bring a side for his testimonial. In three seasons at Everton, McCall played 103 league games as well as earned his first caps with Scotland but he failed to lift any trophies as the club finished eighth, sixth and ninth in the league.40
Rangers
In 1991, Rangers paid &lt;U+00A3&gt;1.2 million for McCall.41 Rangers had just won their third successive Scottish Premier Division title. Under manager Walter Smith, McCall ended up playing in the final six of the club's nine successive Scottish league titles that firmly established them as Scotland's top club side after several years of being matched and often overtaken by Celtic and Aberdeen. In his first season at Ibrox, Rangers won the league and cup double, before they achieved greater success in 1992–93, winning both cups 2–1 against Aberdeen and coming nine points ahead of Aberdeen in the league.42 McCall also had European success that season when the Glasgow club narrowly missed out on an appearance in the UEFA Champions League 1992–93 final, coming second in the semi-final group stage to eventual winners Olympique de Marseille.43 In 1993–94, Rangers added another Scottish League Cup title along with the league championship, but lost 1–0 in the final of the Scottish Cup to Dundee United. The following season saw Rangers win the league by their greatest margin as they finished 15 points ahead of Motherwell, but they failed to reach the final of either domestic cup. Although their winning margin was reduced to four points, from city rivals Celtic, in 1995–96, Rangers' points tally of 87 was a record-high total. McCall played in his fourth Scottish Cup final as Rangers defeated Hearts 5–1. Rangers again pushed Celtic into second place in 1996–97 and defeated Hearts 4–3 in the Scottish League Cup. But with the club chasing an unprecedented 10th straight title in 1997–98 they had to settle for the runners-up position, with Celtic winning the league by just two points on the final day of the season. McCall was substituted in the Scottish Cup final as Rangers went the season without picking up a single title for the first season in McCall's time at the club.44
In February 2008, McCall became the 71st inductee into the Rangers hall of fame. McCall's former teammate and Rangers assistant manager Ally McCoist presented him with the award.45
Back to Bradford City
McCall still had one year left on his Rangers contract in 1998, but much of the team that Walter Smith had built had left and McCall was allowed to leave on a free transfer as long as he joined an English club.46 Barnsley and Huddersfield Town were both interested in signing McCall, but he rejoined Bradford City as club captain.47 Rookie manager Paul Jewell put together a squad to battle for promotion, adding other new signings, including central midfield partner Gareth Whalley and striker Lee Mills, who went on to be club's top goal-scorer.48 The season started off slowly with just one win from the first seven games, but by the latter half of the season, City were vying with Ipswich Town and Birmingham City for the second promotion spot behind runaway leaders Sunderland. Loan signing Lee Sharpe and Dean Windass were added to the ranks and City had the chance to seal promotion in their penultimate game against relegation-threatened Oxford United. The game finished as a 0–0 draw, with McCall heading over the goal in the final minutes, taking the promotion bid to the final game of the season.49 Days later he was named the club's player of the year.50 A 3–2 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux on 9 May 1999 ensured promotion to the Premier League and denied Ipswich Town—the team that had thwarted McCall and Bradford 11 years before.51 Following the game, the players were celebrating with fans at the club's ground, when McCall fell off a car after drinking for more than five hours after the end of the game.52
Bradford were expected to struggle in their first season in the top flight for 77 years.53 Jewell signed David Wetherall, Dean Saunders and Neil Redfearn, all experienced top flight performers, but City were in the bottom four teams for most of the season. It was Bradford's home form—they earned 26 of their 36 points at Valley Parade—that was key to City avoiding relegation, which was narrowly averted by two points after a 1–0 final day victory over Liverpool in 1999–2000.54 When Jewell left only days after the season ended, McCall was appointed assistant manager to Chris Hutchings,55 and subsequently served as caretaker manager for two games when Hutchings was sacked after just 12 games of the 2000–01 league season.56 City were relegated with just 26 points. During a 6–1 defeat to West Yorkshire rivals Leeds United in the penultimate game, McCall and team-mate Andy Myers fought on the pitch.57
McCall stayed on for one more season before he was released by then manager Nicky Law in May 2002, shortly before the club went into administration for the first time after finishing 15th in Division One.58 His playing career at Bradford City had looked uncertain in December 2001 before Law arrived, when previous manager Jim Jefferies had left McCall out of the side in a 3–1 defeat at Manchester City following a training ground dispute.5960 However, it was Jefferies who lost out in the dispute when he resigned his post a week later after summit talks with chairman Geoffrey Richmond.61 In April 2002, McCall's testimonial match against Rangers attracted a crowd of more than 21,000 to Valley Parade.62 Two years later, he played one more time in City colours in a Save Our City appeal match organised by Bradford's evening newspaper, the Telegraph &amp; Argus, to raise funds for the club, who were now in administration for a second time.6364
Sheffield United
On 2 July 2002 McCall joined Sheffield United, where he played an integral part in their first-team side, despite being 38, and also coached the reserves to the league title.65 He played 71 league games over the next two seasons, and scored twice, including a winner against former side Bradford.66 He was in the side that reached the Division One play-off final in 2003 as well as the semi-finals of both cup competitions that year.67 However he and Dean Windass, who was also now at Sheffield United, were both left out of the play-off final, as United lost 3–0 to Wolverhampton Wanderers.68 McCall played just two Carling Cup games in the 2004–05 season, and retired just a few weeks before his 41st birthday.69
International career
McCall was picked for England and Scotland under 21 sides on the same day in 1984,70 and chose to play for England in a game against Turkey. However, he was only picked as a substitute and the referee blew the final whistle with McCall waiting to come on.71 This meant he was still eligible for both England and Scotland, and McCall eventually switched allegiances to the latter, for whom he qualified through his father, making his debut in March 1988, ironically against England.72
He went on to be capped by the Scottish senior team and made his debut on 28 March 1990 in a 1–0 friendly victory over Argentina.73 He played in five friendlies in 1990 which earned him a call up to the Italia 90 World Cup squad. He played in all three of Scotland's World Cup games. They lost their first game 1–0 to Costa Rica, before McCall scored what would be his only international goal against Sweden in a 2–1 victory.7475 However, Scotland failed to qualify for the knock-out stage when they were defeated 1–0 by Brazil.76
McCall represented Scotland at the European Championships in 1992, when they again failed to go beyond the group stage after defeats to Netherlands and Germany, and in 1996 when they were edged out in the first round by Netherlands.77 Scotland failed to qualify for the World Cup in 1994. McCall played just two qualifying games for the 1998 World Cup and his last cap came in a friendly against Denmark on 25 March 1998, as he was overlooked for the final squad for the finals in France along with team-mate Ally McCoist.78 He was capped a total of 40 times for Scotland, scoring one goal.79 McCall's caps included 11 while at Everton and 29 during his career with Rangers.80
Coaching and management career
Early coaching career
In July 2000, McCall accepted his first coaching role, when he was appointed assistant manager to Chris Hutchings at Bradford City, after Hutchings was promoted from the role to replace Paul Jewell as City manager.81 Just four months later, Hutchings was sacked, and McCall was appointed as caretaker/player manager.82 His first game as manager was against his former team Everton, who were managed by his former manager Walter Smith, but ended with a 1–0 defeat.83 He was in charge for one more game, which also ended in defeat, until Jim Jefferies was appointed the new manager. Jefferies brought with him his own assistant Billy Brown, and McCall was appointed first-team coach.84
After leaving Bradford City, he joined Sheffield United, where he also took up a coaching role.85 When he retired in 2004, he remained at Sheffield United as assistant to Neil Warnock.86 Working alongside Warnock and learning the managerial ropes from him,8788 he helped mastermind Sheffield's promotion to the Premier League in 2006.89 United were relegated to the Championship on the final day of the 2006–07 season and Warnock resigned three days later.9091 McCall had already decided that the 2006–07 season would be his last as assistant manager,92 and when he was overlooked as a successor to the United manager's position, in favour of Bryan Robson, he decided to leave after five years with the club.93
Return to Bradford City
McCall admitted in his autobiography, The Real McCall, he wanted to manage Bradford.

He had been linked with the manager's position at Bradford City on numerous previous occasions,949596 and after Colin Todd was sacked on 12 February 2007,97 City chairman Julian Rhodes made McCall his number one target to take over in the summer.98 Club captain David Wetherall temporarily took over and was later announced as caretaker manager for the rest of the 2006–07 season.99 On 18 May 2007 it was announced McCall would become full-time manager of the club where he started his career, and on 1 June 2007 he assumed the position.100 In less than seven years since McCall's first two-game reign, serious financial problems had driven the club to the verge of closure, and although they survived the threat of oblivion, they were unable to avoid a terrible on-the-pitch decline, which continued after the financial nightmare had been relieved.101 On McCall's return to Valley Parade, the Bantams had just been relegated to League Two—meaning that they would be playing in the bottom division for the first time in 25 years.102 McCall set himself a target of earning promotion back to League One in his first season.103
Bradford had just 13 players when McCall took over,104 and he made a number of summer signings including defender Darren Williams, midfielders Kyle Nix, Alex Rhodes and Scott Phelan, and strikers Barry Conlon, Guylain Ndumbu-Nsungu and Peter Thorne.105106107 McCall recorded his first win as a manager against Wrexham on 25 August 2007 after substitute Luke Medley scored a late winner,108 but despite his pre-season target his team have spent most of the season in the bottom half of the table. After going unbeaten in January, the club were still 15th in League Two, and McCall told the Telegraph &amp; Argus he did not regret his pre-season target but was carried away with the euphoria at the time.109 City's form continued to improve during the second half of the season, and McCall led his side to 10th place in League Two.110
Despite City finishing outside the play-off places, they were again installed as favourites for promotion by bookmakers for the 2008–09 season.111 McCall released 13 players from his squad and replaced them with a number of signings with experience in a higher division, as well as Michael Boulding, who was one of League Two's top goalscorers during the 2007–08 campaign.112113114 McCall's side made a good start to the season, and after winning five of their opening six league games, went top of the league—the first time City had led the table in seven years.115

Style of play
McCall was a box-to-box midfielder characterised by his tireless running,119 tackling and also weighing in with an average of one goal every 11 games.120 Despite his position in the middle of the park he was rarely suspended and was sent off just once in his career—in the final minute of a 2–0 defeat to Charlton Athletic on 4 November 2000.121122 He also had a never-say-die attitude proven by a number of key late goals including his equaliser which sent the 1989 FA Cup Final into extra-time,123 and a 93rd minute equaliser against Tottenham Hotspur during Bradford's difficult start to their Premier League campaign in the 1999–2000 season.124 He was a passionate player whose strong desire to win even ran to reserve games.125 Even in his final years of his career he was described as a player with &quot;plenty of drive and ambition&quot; by manager Neil Warnock.126
