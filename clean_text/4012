Club career
Youth
&lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard spent his first years in the local sports club Drammen Strong. His father, a former footballer, co-founded a football section in the club, and became the coach of his son's team.23 In 2005, when &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard was six, his parents and others each invested 50,000 kroner so that the local club could refit their gravel field, Kjappen, with artificial turf. This has been cited as crucial for his development, as &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard spent countless hours on the field.45
Drammen Strong was twice selected by &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard to receive a prize of 50,000 kroner (&lt;U+20AC&gt;5,800), when the young player was given the Statoil talent award for April 2014 and for the 2014 season.6 Later, in 2015, Drammen Strong received 250,000 kroner, equivalent to approximately &lt;U+20AC&gt;29,000, as a gift from Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset IF when &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard was sold to Real Madrid.7
In 2009, &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard joined the youth division of Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset.8 He trained and played with older boys. In 2011, at age 12, he impressed former football manager Lars Tj&lt;U+00E6&gt;rn&lt;U+00E5&gt;s during a nationwide tournament for under-16s: &quot;The best 15-year-olds in the country were gathered for a tournament between the top clubs. (...) It was definitely not the first time he had astonished his opponents or the spectators. He was three or four years younger than the others. It was impossible not to realize that we were witnessing something out of the ordinary.&quot;9
Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset
&lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard began training with the Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset first team in 2012, aged 13. He made his first team debut the same year, in a mid-season friendly against local rivals Mj&lt;U+00F8&gt;ndalen IF.10 He also had short training visits to Bayern Munich and Manchester United.11 In 2013, at age 14, &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard played for both Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset's junior team (normally aged 17&lt;U+2013&gt;19), and the club's third team at the fifth tier of Norwegian senior football.
In January 2014, it was agreed that 15-year-old &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard would be part of Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset's first team in 2014, but no professional contract was signed. The competition rules state that to play in Tippeligaen, players must have a professional contract to be eligble.12 However, the club included &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard on the &quot;B-list&quot; for amateur players, which made him eligble for up to three matches per season.13 &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard was unable to train with Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset in the daytime since he was still in compulsory education. Thus, as part of the agreement, he trained two evenings a week with Mj&lt;U+00F8&gt;ndalen, a semi-professional First Division team at the time, where his father was one of the coaches.14
He made his league debut for Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset in a match against Aalesunds FK at Marienlyst Stadion on 13 April 2014. Aged 15 years and 118 days, he became the youngest footballer ever to play in Tippeligaen.15 On 5 May 2014, he signed a professional contract with Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset, lasting until the end of 2015.16 This removed the restriction of three matches per season. On 16 May 2014, he scored his first professional goal and became the youngest goalscorer in Tippeligaen when he scored the fourth goal for Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset in a 4&lt;U+2013&gt;1 home victory against Sarpsborg 08 FF.17 He made his European debut on 16 July, replacing Lars Christopher Vilsvik for the final five minutes of the club's 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 home defeat to Steaua Bucure&lt;U+015F&gt;ti in the UEFA Champions League second qualifying round.18
In late July, an away match at Sandnes Ulf prompted serious discussion in national newspapers VG,19 Dagbladet20 and Aftenposten,21 on his possible call-up to the Norwegian national team. &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard was involved in all three goals for his team, including a goal and an assist. He was also fouled for a penalty which was missed by a teammate.22 John Arne Riise, the most-capped player on the Norwegian national team, was impressed, and &quot;demanded&quot; &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard should be called up to play against the big nations of Europe.23 Former manager for Norway, Nils Johan Semb, said after the match that &quot;Martin is one of the best 15-year-olds in Europe,&quot; 24 but added that he should not be rushed into the national team. &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard himself stated to the press that if he would be asked to play for Norway, he would say yes.25
In the away match against IK Start on 15 August the same year, &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard was placed on the right wing, and made all three assists for Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset, who won 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2.26 He scored two goals in a match for the first time in his career in the 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 win against Lillestr&lt;U+00F8&gt;m SK on 19 October.27 Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset finished fourth in the league, qualifying for the first qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League, with &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard having scored 5 goals in 23 league games in addition to 7 assists.28
In December 2014, during the Norwegian close season, he trained with the first teams at Liverpool,29 Bayern Munich.30 Manchester United and Manchester City.31 He also visited Arsenal.32 In January 2015, he trained with Real Madrid.33
Real Madrid
On 21 January 2015, Real Madrid reached an agreement to sign &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard from Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset,34 for a fee reported by Spanish media as around &lt;U+20AC&gt;3 million.35 Norwegian media reported, however, that the fee was 35 million kroner (approximately &lt;U+20AC&gt;4 million), which could rise to 70-75 million kroner (approximately &lt;U+20AC&gt;8-8.5 million) on certain conditions.36 In a press conference after the signing, Real Madrid announced that &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard would train with both the club's first team and the reserves, Real Madrid Castilla. He would play for the latter team, which is managed by Zinedine Zidane.3738
He made his unofficial debut for the reserves on 4 February, in a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;3 friendly draw with Beijing Guoan. He was subsequently named in the first team's UEFA Champions League squad.39 &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard was assigned the number 21.40 His official debut for Castilla came on 8 February, coming on in the last 20 minutes as a substitute in the 2–2 draw against Athletic Bilbao B in Segunda Divisi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n B.41

Senior
On 19 August 2014, &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard was called up for a senior international against the United Arab Emirates in Stavanger56 and played the entire goalless draw on 27 August, becoming the youngest player to play for Norway at senior level, at 15 years and 253 days.57 The record was previously held by Tormod Kjellsen, who was 15 years and 351 days on his debut in 1910.58
On 30 September 2014, he was called up to Norway's UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying matches against Malta and Bulgaria.59 He made his competitive debut in the latter, replacing Mats M&lt;U+00F8&gt;ller D&lt;U+00E6&gt;hli in the 64th minute of a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 home win. At the age of 15 years and 300 days, this made him the youngest player to ever play in a European Championship qualifier, breaking a record held since 1983 by Icelander Sigur&lt;U+00F0&gt;ur J&lt;U+00F3&gt;nsson.6061
Playing style
An article in the Liverpool Echo described &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard as &quot;an attack-minded midfielder very much in the modern mould. Diminutive, quick-footed, with natural balance, pace and, perhaps surprisingly for one so young, excellent shooting power&quot;.62 David Nielsen, his manager at Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset, likened him to David Silva and Lionel Messi. Amidst transfer speculation in December 2014, he opined that the player would develop better with a second season in Norway.63
In September 2014, international teammate Morten Gamst Pedersen dubbed &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard the most talented player he had ever seen, saying &quot;For his age he is unbelievable &lt;U+2013&gt; his knowledge of the game is unbelievable and his technical skills are fantastic&quot;. Pedersen also stated that &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard needed time to improve at the physical aspects of the sport.64
When describing his son, Hans Erik &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard said, &quot;It's the pace of the game that makes the difference in adjusting to different levels. We've used so many hours in working with his first and second touch to take off the pressure. We have worked a lot on bringing the ball closely to his feet, so he can change direction quickly, so even if he's physically weaker than the others he doesn't get caught because he's able to get away.&quot;65
After &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard signed for Real Madrid, Norwegian former football scout Tor-Kristian Karlsen praised his mentality, stating that he had &quot;overcome every challenge in front of him&quot;. Karlsen called him &quot;so level-headed and mature&quot; and noted his intelligence and performance at school, while also saying that this could be a disadvantage as &quot;The best footballers tend to have a bit of needle, a bit of fire&quot;.66 While former Norway international Jan Aage Fjortoft was supportive of the transfer to Real Madrid due to the opportunity to learn from Zidane, he warned that at the age of 16 he needed time to develop: &quot;Comparing &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard to Messi is nonsense from the media. Messi is a player who can make the difference and Martin can do the same, but any comparisons should not be taken seriously&quot;.67
Personal life
&lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard is the son of former footballer Hans Erik &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard, who played as a midfielder for Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset and Sandefjord Fotball and was assistant manager of Mj&lt;U+00F8&gt;ndalen IF from 2009 to 2015.68 He was still attending a local lower secondary school when he made his professional debut, but has since completed his compulsory education in Norway. He is a supporter of English team Liverpool, whom he has described as his &quot;dream club&quot;.697071 &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard looked up to Barcelona's Lionel Messi,72 although on joining their rivals Real Madrid he was reported to have deleted tweets in which he had praised Messi.73 Due to his age, &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard was absent from the computer game Football Manager 2015 until his father gave permission to use his son's likeness.74
&lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard has grown up in a Christian family and has expressed that religious faith is an important part of his life.75
