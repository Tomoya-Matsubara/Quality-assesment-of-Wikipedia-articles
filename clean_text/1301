Biography
Early life
Missy Higgins was born in Melbourne, Victoria in 1983 to an English-Australian doctor and an Australian childcare centre operator.234 She has an older sister, Nicola and an older brother, David.56 She learned to play classical piano from age six, following in the footsteps of her general practitioner father and her brother.7 She realised she wanted to be a singer at about 12 when she appeared in a school production of Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.89 It was about this time that she gave up playing the piano, bored of being &quot;forced to practise.&quot;10 Hoping for more freedom than she had at home, she begged her parents to send her away to Geelong Grammar School, the independent boarding school that her siblings had previously attended.11 At Geelong she took up the piano again, this time playing jazz.12 Somewhat introverted at school, she found that practising the piano helped her to cope with the &quot;intensity&quot; of being at boarding school.13 At weekends she performed in her brother's jazz group.1415
At 15, she wrote &quot;All for Believing&quot; for a school music assignment, completing it hours before the deadline.16 The song earned her an A for the assignment, and the chance to perform in front of her classmates.17 She followed the advice of a family friend and went to a Melbourne record company, but they wanted more than the one song she had to offer.18 She wrote more songs and worked with the Kool Skools project which enables students to record music.19 In 2001 Higgins' sister entered &quot;All for Believing&quot; on her behalf into Unearthed, radio station triple J's competition for unsigned bands. The song won the competition and was added to the station's playlist.20 Two record companies showed an interest in Higgins &lt;U+2014&gt; Sony and Eleven.21 She signed with Eleven, a decision partly based on the fact that they were happy for her to take time to backpack around Europe.22 The trip had been planned with a friend for years and she spent most of 2002 in Europe.2324 While she was travelling, a recording of &quot;All for Believing&quot; started to be played by Los Angeles radio station KCRW.25 This brought attention from US record labels and, by the end of 2002, an international record deal with Warner Bros.26
2003&lt;U+2013&gt;2005: The Sound of White
 In 2003, Higgins embarked on an Australian tour with folk rock band The Waifs and rock band george.27 She travelled to the US to work with Eleven manager John Watson, recording her first EP Missy Higgins.28

September also saw her nominated in five categories at the ARIA Music Awards for &quot;Scar&quot;; Best Female Artist, Single of the Year, Best Pop Release, Breakthrough Artist &lt;U+2014&gt; Single and Best Video.37 At the awards ceremony on 17 October she received the award for Best Pop Release, beating Delta Goodrem, The Dissociatives, Kylie Minogue and Pete Murray.3839

In March Higgins performed at the MTV Australia Awards and won the award for Breakthrough Artist of the Year.42 The following month she released her third single, &quot;The Special Two&quot;. It was a hit on Australian radio and reached #2 on the ARIA charts.43 &quot;The Special Two&quot; EP was released on an EP which included Higgins' cover of the Skyhooks song, &quot;You Just Like Me Cos I'm Good In Bed&quot;, which she recorded for Triple J's 30th anniversary. The song had been the first track played on triple J when it launched (as Double J) in 1975.44 She continued touring in mid-2005 and released her fourth single, &quot;The Sound of White&quot;, in August.45
She was nominated for a further seven ARIA Awards for The Sound Of White and in October won Album of the Year, Best Female Artist (for &quot;Scar&quot;), Best Pop Release, Breakthrough Artist &lt;U+2014&gt; Album Release and Highest Selling Album.46 In late 2005 she teamed up with Australian singer Ben Lee for a national tour.47
2006&lt;U+2013&gt;present: On a Clear Night
 In 2006, Higgins lived alone in Broome, Western Australia for six months writing new material.4849 The landscape made a big impression on her and she later said &quot;It was the first place I'd ever felt honestly connected with my country, with the physical land of my country&quot;.50 The move inspired her to write the song &quot;Going North&quot;.51 She then toured the United States and South Africa, writing more material on the road.52 In September she based herself in Los Angeles to record her second album, On a Clear Night, with producer Mitchell Froom.53 &quot;Steer&quot;, the first single from that album was released on 4 April 2007 and the album followed on 28 April 2007.5455
On 7 July 2007, Higgins participated in the Live Earth concert in Sydney, performing her own set before joining Paul Kelly, Kev Carmody and John Butler on stage for the song &quot;From Little Things Big Things Grow&quot;.56 Writing for The Sydney Morning Herald, Emily Dunn said that the song &quot;could have been the event's anthem&quot;.57 Dan Lander from Rolling Stone cited it as a highlight, saying that the &quot;whole crowd sung along &lt;U+2013&gt; all eleven verses.&quot;58
In August, Higgins returned to Los Angeles to focus on the US market.5960 She spent September and October 2007 touring the US, still relatively unknown there.61 On 26 October, backed by the Sydney Youth Orchestra, she headlined the annual Legs 11 concert, a breast cancer benefit held in The Domain, at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney.6263 On 28 October, she attended the 2007 ARIA Music Awards, where she had been nominated for four awards; Best Pop Release, Best Female Artist, Highest Selling Album and Highest Selling Single (for &quot;Steer&quot;).64 She performed at the ceremony and won the award for Best Female Artist.65 On 31 October, she was a guest at television music channel MAX's inaugural Concert For the Cure, a private concert for people affected by breast cancer.66 She sang lead vocals to headline act Powderfinger's &quot;Sunsets&quot; with front man Bernard Fanning and joined in with the encore of &quot;These Days&quot;.67 She spent the last two months of 2007 on a national tour of Australia called For One Night Only, taking in Cairns, Sydney and Perth.68 She was joined on some of the dates by You Am I lead singer Tim Rogers.6970
On a Clear Night, was released in the US on 28 February 2008 with a tour in March to coincide with the release. Her stay in Los Angeles, which lasted for the first half of 2008, was designed to promote the use of her music in films and television shows.71 Her first US single &quot;Where I Stood&quot; was particularly successful in this regard and was featured in US series including Grey's Anatomy, Brothers &amp; Sisters, Smallville, Lipstick Jungle, The Hills, One Tree Hill, NCIS, Men in Trees and So You Think You Can Dance.727374

Until 2007, Higgins' sexual orientation was the subject of speculation from some journalists due to interpretations of her lyrics and comments made by her in interviews.929394 In a October 2007 interview with Australian lesbian magazine Cherrie, she was asked if she fell under the moniker of &quot;not-so-straight&quot; girls. She replied &quot;Um, yeah, definitely&quot;.95 She then went on to say &quot;I think sexuality is a fluid thing and it's becoming increasingly more acceptable to admit that you're that way&quot;.9697 The following month she said on her Myspace blog, &quot;I&lt;U+2019&gt;ve been in relationships with both men and women so I guess I fall most easily under the category 'Bisexual'.&quot;98 She went on to say that she wanted future interviews to focus on her music rather than her sexuality.99
In a March 2008 interview with AfterEllen.com, Missy said that her song &quot;Secret&quot; was written about an ex-girlfriend who was not comfortable going public with their relationship, stating &quot;When we first started our relationship, she was not comfortable with bringing it out into the open, and I was so head over heels in love with her I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something under the covers and not being comfortable sharing something with the world, keeping it away locked in a little room.&quot;100
Higgins is a supporter of Australian mental health charity One in Five, and has been patron of the organisation since 2003.101102 She has described her younger self as &quot;a bit of a depressed child&quot; and &quot;introverted&quot;,103 and has said that she has experienced &quot;experienced various degrees of depression&quot;.104 Prescribed antidepressant medication while in high school, she learned to channel low moods into song writing, calling music her &quot;emotional outlet&quot;.105106107 In a 2006 interview she said that her songs were &quot;coming from more of a happier place&quot;.108 While recording her second album in 2006, she discovered another passion &lt;U+2014&gt; rock climbing, which she calls a &quot;meditative pursuit&quot;.109110 She says &quot;It's the first thing I've had &lt;U+2014&gt; other than music &lt;U+2014&gt; that I'm passionate about.&quot;111
