The Brownlow Medal is the most prestigious individual award in Australian rules football. The award will be presented on Monday, 23 September, in the week before the 2013 AFL Grand Final.
Leading votegetters
Voting procedure
The three field umpires (those umpires who control the flow of the game, as opposed to goal or boundary umpires) confer after each match and award three votes, two votes and one vote to the players they regard as the best, second best and third best in the match, respectively. The votes are kept secret until the awards night, and are read and tallied on the evening.
As the medal is awarded to the fairest and best player in the league,1 those who have been suspended during the season by the AFL Tribunal are ineligible to win the award; however, they may still continue to poll votes.
