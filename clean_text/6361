Baptism of Tiridates III.

The majority of Armenians follow Christianity, which has existed in Armenia for over 1,700 years. Armenia has its own church, the Armenian Apostolic Church, which most Armenians follow. Christianity has a strong influence in the country, but there is a small presence of other religions too.
Christianity
Armenian Apostolics (Orthodox)

The dominant religion in Armenia is Christianity, with 94.7% of the population following the Armenian Apostolic Church.1
Christianity was first introduced by the apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus in the first century AD. Armenia became the first country to establish Christianity as its state religion when, in an event traditionally dated to 301 A.D, St. Gregory the Illuminator convinced Tiridates III, the king of Armenia, to convert to Christianity. Before this, the dominant religion was Zoroastrianism and to a smaller degree paganism.
Armenian Catholics

Smaller groups belong to the Armenian Catholic Church (an Eastern Catholic church in full communion with Rome).
Armenian Evangelicals
There are also small communities of Protestant Armenians of various denominations, as missionaries converted a number of Armenians.
Other denominations and sects
The Jehovah's Witnesses have a presence as well. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints claims over 2,000 adherents in Armenia at the end of 2005 (lds.org website).
Paganism
Still in Armenia are pagans who are in most of times followers of Zoroastrianism`s doctrine . Same time Armenians have their own pantheon of Gods. Now the pagans in Armenia are around 3000.
Judaism

Jews have a historic presence in Armenia. During the Soviet years, Armenia was considered to be one of the most tolerant republics for Jews in the Soviet Union. Currently there are an estimated 750 Jews in the country, a remnant of a once larger community. Most left Armenia for Israel after the collapse of the Soviet Union because of inadequate services. Still, despite the small numbers, a high intermarriage rate and relative isolation, a lot of enthusiasm exists to help the community meet its needs. 2
Islam

Azeris and Kurds living in Armenia traditionally practiced Islam, but most Azeris have fled the country due to the Nagorno-Karabakh War. Approximately 1,000 Muslims live in Yerevan, and one 18th century Mosque remains open for Friday prayers.Islam in Armenia consists mostly of Azeris and Muslim Kurds. In 2009, the Pew Research Center estimated that less than 0.1% of the population, or about 1,000 people, were Muslims.[1]
Armenians did not convert to Islam in large numbers. During the Arabic conquest, Islam came to the Armenians however, almost all Armenians never converted to Islam, since Christians were not required to convert by Muslim law, and the absence of heavy taxation also hindered this. The story was similar in the Ottoman Empire.
During 1988-1991 the overwhelming majority of Muslim population consisting of Azeris and Muslim Kurds fled the country as a result of the Nagorno-Karabakh War and the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. There is also a significant community of Yazidi Kurds (50-70,000 people), who were not affected by this conflict. Since the early 1990s, Armenia has also attracted diverse esoteric and sectarian groups. [2]
Yazidism

About 2% of Armenia's population, mostly ethnic Kurds living in the western part of the country, follow the ancient Yazidi religion. Many Yazidis came to Armenia and Georgia during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to escape religious persecution.
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith

The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith in Armenia begins with some involvements in the banishments and execution of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b,3 the Founder of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith, viewed by Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s as a precursor religion. The same year of the execution of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b the religion was introduced into Armenia.4 During the period of Soviet policy of religious oppression, the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s in Armenia lost contact with the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s elsewhere.5 However in 1963 communities were identified6 in Yerevan and Artez.7 Following Perestroika the first Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Local Spiritual Assemblies of Armenia form in 19918 and Armenian Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s elected their first National Spiritual Assembly in 1995.9 As of 2004 the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s claim about 200 members in Armenia10 but as of 2001 Operation World estimated about 1,400.11
Freedom of religion

The Constitution as amended in December 2005 provides for freedom of religion; however, the law places some restrictions on the religious freedom of adherents of minority religious groups, and there were some restrictions in practice. The Armenian (Apostolic) Church, which has formal legal status as the national church, enjoys some privileges not available to other religious groups.
Some religious denominations reported occasional discrimination by mid- or low-level government officials but found high-level officials to be tolerant. Jehovah's Witnesses reported that judges sentenced them to longer prison terms for evasion of alternative military service than in the past, although the sentences were still within the range allowed by law. Societal attitudes toward some minority religious groups were ambivalent, and there were reports of societal discrimination directed against members of these groups.
