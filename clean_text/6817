 This is a list of seasons played by Ipswich Town Football Club in English and European football, from 1878 (the year of the club's foundation) to the most recent completed season.
Following their foundation in 1878, Ipswich Town played amateur football against teams from around Suffolk. During the 1880s the club played a number of matches in the Suffolk Challenge Cup winning it three times. Throughout the early part of the 20th century Ipswich played in various amateur competitions including the Norfolk and Suffolk League, the South East Anglian League, the Eastern Counties League and the Southern Amateur League. Turning professional in 1936, Ipswich joined the Southern Football League before moving into the Football League by gaining entry to Division Three (South) in the 1937–38 season.
The club has won the League Championship on a single occasion, the FA Cup once, and the UEFA Cup once.1 This list details the club's achievements in all major competitions, and the top scorers for each season. Records of competitions such as the Texaco Cup are not included, due to them being considered of lesser importance.
