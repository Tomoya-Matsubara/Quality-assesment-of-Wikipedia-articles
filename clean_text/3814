Scarlett Johansson (born November 22, 1984) is an American actress and singer. Johansson made her film debut in the 1994 film North and was later nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead for her performance in 1996's Manny &amp; Lo. Johansson rose to fame with her roles in 1998's The Horse Whisperer and 2001's Ghost World.
She transitioned to adult roles with her performances in Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation, for which she won a B.A.F.T.A. Award, and Girl with a Pearl Earring, both of which earned her Golden Globe Award nominations in 2003. A role in A Love Song for Bobby Long earned her a third Golden Globe for Best Actress nomination. Following an appearance in The Island, Johansson garnered a fourth Golden Globe nomination, for Best Supporting Actress, for her role in Woody Allen's Match Point. She followed that with another Allen film, Scoop, with Hugh Jackman. A role in Brian De Palma's film noir The Black Dahlia was followed by a second role opposite Hugh Jackman in The Prestige, also starring Christian Bale.
On May 20, 2008, Johansson debuted as a vocalist on her first album, Anywhere I Lay My Head, which included cover versions of Tom Waits songs. Her second album, Break Up, with Pete Yorn was released in September 2009.
Early life
Johansson was born in New York City on November 22, 1984.1 Her father, Karsten Johansson, is a Danish architect who was the son of Ejner Johansson, a screen-writer and director. Her mother, Melanie Sloan, a producer, comes from an Ashkenazi Jewish family from the Bronx.2345 Johansson's parents met in Denmark, where her mother lived with Johansson's maternal grandmother, Dorothy, a former bookkeeper and schoolteacher.6 Johansson has an older sister, Vanessa, who is an actress; an older brother, Adrian; a twin brother, Hunter (who appeared in the film Manny &amp; Lo with Scarlett);7 and an older half-brother, Christian, from her father's first marriage.8
Johansson grew up in a house-hold with &quot;little money,&quot;9 and with a mother who was a &quot;film buff.&quot;10 She and her brother, Hunter, attended P.S. 41 in Greenwich Village in elementary school.11 Johansson began her theatrical training by attending and graduating from Professional Children's School in Manhattan in 2002.12
Acting career
Early roles
Johansson began acting during childhood, after her mother started taking her to auditions.13 She made her film debut at nine years old, as John Ritter's daughter in the 1994 fantasy comedy North.14 Following minor roles in the 1995 film Just Cause, as the daughter of Sean Connery and Kate Capshaw, and If Lucy Fell in 1996, she played the role of Amanda in Manny &amp; Lo (1996). Her performance in Manny &amp; Lo garnered a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Female,15 and positive reviews, one noting, &quot;[the film] grows on you, largely because of the charm of ... Scarlett Johansson&quot;,16 while San Francisco Chronicle critic Mick LaSalle commentated on her &quot;peaceful aura&quot;, and wrote, &quot;If she can get through puberty with that aura undisturbed, she could become an important actress.&quot;17
After appearing in minor roles in Fall and Home Alone 3 in 1997, Johansson garnered widely spread attention for her performance in the 1998 film The Horse Whisperer, directed by Robert Redford.18 She received a nomination for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actress for the film.1920 In 1999, she appeared in both My Brother the Pig and the neo-noir Coen brothers film The Man Who Wasn't There. Also in 1999, she appeared in the music video for Mandy Moore's single, &quot;Candy&quot;.21 Although the film was not a box office success,22 she received praise for her break-out role23 in the 2001 film, Ghost World.2425 Credited with &quot;sensitivity and talent [that] belie her age&quot;,26 Johansson went on to win the Chlotrudis27 and Toronto Film Critics Association Awards for Best Supporting Actress28 and was nominated for the Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Supporting Actress.29 In 2002, Johansson appeared in the comedy-horror thriller Eight Legged Freaks, starring David Arquette.
Transition to adult roles
Johansson made the transition from teen roles to adult roles, with two such roles in 2003.30 In the Sofia Coppola film Lost in Translation, she played Charlotte, an abandoned young wife, opposite Bill Murray.3132 Roger Ebert wrote that he loved the film and described the performances of Johansson and Murray as &quot;wonderful.&quot;33 Entertainment Weekly wrote of Johansson's &quot;embracing, restful serenity,&quot;34 and the New York Times said, &quot;At 18, the actress gets away with playing a 25-year-old woman by using her husky voice to test the level of acidity in the air ... Ms. Johansson is not nearly as accomplished a performer as Mr. Murray, but Ms. Coppola gets around this by using Charlotte's simplicity and curiosity as keys to her character.&quot;35 Johansson won the BAFTA Award36 and the Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress37 and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress.38 She received nominations from a number of film critic organizations, including the Broadcast Film Critics Association,39 the Chicago Film Critics Association,40 the Phoenix Film Critics Society41 and the Chlotrudis Awards.42
Johansson played Griet in Peter Webber's Girl with a Pearl Earring. While noting, &quot;Audiences feel as if they are spying on a moment of artistic inspiration when painter Vermeer creates the title work&quot;, USA Today praised her, suggesting, &quot;[She] is having a banner year that Oscar voters should recognize.&quot;43 In his review for the New Yorker, Anthony Lane said, &quot;What keeps Webber&lt;U+2019&gt;s movie alive is the tenseness of the setup ... and, above all, the presence of Johansson. She is often wordless and close to plain onscreen, but wait for the ardor with which she can summon a closeup and bloom under its gaze; this is her film, not Vermeer&lt;U+2019&gt;s, all the way.&quot;44 Owen Gleiberman, for Entertainment Weekly, wrote of her &quot;nearly silent performance&quot;, observing, &quot;The interplay on her face of fear, ignorance, curiosity, and sex is intensely dramatic.&quot;45 She was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama46 and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.47 She was also nominated by the London Film Critics' Circle,48 the Phoenix Film Critics Society49 and the British Independent Film Awards.50
Johansson was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, in June 2004.51 In the same year, she voiced a role in The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie and appeared in an adaptation of Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan entitled A Good Woman, opposite Helen Hunt and Tom Wilkinson. It received a limited U.S. release, and was both a box office52 and critical53 failure. It was described by the New York Times as a &quot;misbegotten Hollywood-minded screen adaptation&quot; with &quot;an excruciating divide between the film's British actors (led by Tom Wilkinson and Stephen Campbell Moore), who are comfortable delivering Wilde's aphorisms ... and its American marquee names, Helen Hunt and Scarlett Johansson, [who have] little connection to the English language as spoken in the high Wildean style.&quot;54 She also appeared in the critically-panned,55 teen, heist film The Perfect Score and in In Good Company, in a supporting role opposite Topher Grace and Dennis Quaid.56 Her performance in the dark, Southern drama, A Love Song for Bobby Long, earned her a third Golden Globe for Best Actress nomination.57 Johansson was involved for a short time with the film Mission: Impossible III, but was not officially cast because of scheduling conflicts, although a falling out with the film's star, Tom Cruise, was reported.58
2005&lt;U+2013&gt;07

Johansson at the film set of Vicky Cristina Barcelona in 2007

In July 2005, Johansson starred, with Ewan McGregor, in Michael Bay's science fiction film, The Island, in dual roles as Sarah Jordan and her clone, Jordan Two Delta. The film was a domestic financial failure5960 and received mixed critical reviews.6162 In contrast, her role as Nola, the American actress with whom Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is obsessed, in the Woody Allen-directed drama Match Point, was well-received. The New York Times said, &quot;Ms. Johansson and Mr. Rhys-Meyers manage some of the best acting seen in a Woody Allen movie in a long time, escaping the archness and emotional disconnection that his writing often imposes.&quot;63 Mick LaSalle, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, said, &quot;[Johansson] is a powerhouse from the word go&quot;, and, &quot;[Her performance] borders on astonishing.&quot;64 Johansson received her fourth Golden Globe nomination,65 and one from the Chicago Film Critics Association, for Best Supporting Actress.66
In another collaboration with Allen, Johansson was cast opposite Hugh Jackman and Allen in the 2006 feature, Scoop. While the film enjoyed a modest worldwide box office success,67 it received mixed reviews by critics.6869 The New York Times called the film &quot;not especially funny yet oddly appealing&quot; and cited parallels to The Thin Man, saying, &quot;[while] Johansson is certainly no Myrna Loy, [her] performance is all over the place ... but finally works for a film that is itself all over the place. Mr. Allen seems happy to just watch her strut her stuff, and after a while so are we.&quot;70 New York magazine said, &quot;Johansson doesn&lt;U+2019&gt;t have the natural buoyancy to play a screwball Nancy Drew, [but] she&lt;U+2019&gt;s smart enough to know what&lt;U+2019&gt;s needed (a young Diane Keaton), and manages to rouse herself&quot;,71 while USA Today criticized &quot;her delivery of Allenesque one-liners&quot; as &quot;clunky&quot;, and &quot;sometimes, she seems in over her head playing opposite Allen.&quot;72 The same year, she appeared in Brian De Palma's The Black Dahlia, a film noir shot in Los Angeles and Bulgaria. Johansson later said she was a De Palma fan and had wanted to work with him on the film, even though she thought that she was &quot;physically wrong&quot; for the part.73 Her reviews were mixed. CNN.com noted, &quot;[Johansson] takes to the pulpy period atmosphere as if it were oxygen,&quot;74 whereas the Kalamazoo Gazette referred to Johansson as &quot;miscast&quot;.75
Johansson next had a supporting role in the Christopher Nolan thriller The Prestige (2006), again opposite Hugh Jackman, as well as Christian Bale. Nolan, who described Johansson as possessing an &quot;ambiguity... a shielded quality&quot;,76 said he was &quot;very keen&quot; for her to play the role.77 Johansson said, &quot;[she] loved working with [Nolan]&quot;, and he was &quot;incredibly focused and driven and involved, and really involved in the performance in every aspect.&quot;78 The film was both a critical79 and a worldwide box office80 success, recommended by the Los Angeles Times as &quot;an adult, provocative piece of work.&quot;81 Also in 2006, Johansson starred in a short film directed by Bennett Miller and set to Bob Dylan's &quot;When the Deal Goes Down...&quot;, released to promote Dylan's album, Modern Times.82
Johansson starred in 2007's The Nanny Diaries, alongside Laura Linney. The film performed only marginally well at the box office,83 and was critically-panned.84 Johansson's reviews were mixed, with Variety saying, &quot;[She] essays an engaging heroine&quot;,85 while The New Yorker criticized her for looking &quot;merely confused&quot; while &quot;trying to give the material a plausible emotional center&quot;.86 In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle said, &quot;There's something painful about watching Scarlett Johansson, who looks as if she never had an indecisive moment in her life, struggle to seem ineffectual.&quot;87
2008&lt;U+2013&gt;present
In 2008, she starred in The Other Boleyn Girl, opposite Natalie Portman and Eric Bana,88 a film which garnered mixed reviews.8990 Writing for Rolling Stone, Pete Travers criticized the film for &quot;[moving] in frustrating herks and jerks&quot;, but was more positive in his assessment of Johansson and Portman, and wrote, &quot;What works is the combustible teaming of Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson, who give the Boleyn hotties a tough core of intelligence and wit, swinging the film's sixteenth-century protofeminist issues handily into this one.&quot;91 Variety credited the cast as &quot;almost flawless ... at the top of its game&quot;, citing &quot;Johansson&lt;U+2019&gt;s quieter Mary ... as the pic&lt;U+2019&gt;s emotional center, her tender love story with the conflicted monarch evoking the only genuine feelings on display.&quot;92
She filmed her third Woody Allen film, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, in Spain,93 appearing opposite Javier Bardem and Pen&lt;U+00E9&gt;lope Cruz. The film was one of Allen's most profitable94 and appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008.95 Overall, the film received generally favorable reviews9697 and brought co-star Cruz numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.98 Johansson was described as being &quot;open and malleable&quot; and &quot;serves as a nice contrast to the [other actors]&quot;.99
Johansson played Silken Floss, a femme fatale and ally of Samuel L. Jackson's villain The Octopus, in Frank Miller's film noir, comedy adaptation of The Spirit. The film, described as &quot;a great-looking movie with an awkward balance of pulp noir and campy self-awareness&quot;100 and &quot;style without substance, style whirling in a senseless void&quot;,101 received mostly poor reviews.102
Johansson appeared in the role of Anna, a yoga instructor, in the 2009 ensemble cast of He's Just Not That Into You, with Jennifer Connelly, Bradley Cooper, Drew Barrymore and Kevin Connolly. The film was a box office success103 but only gained average critical reception.104105 The San Francisco Chronicle review notes, &quot;[The film] never soars, but it never flags&quot; yet lauds Johansson, saying, &quot;She has become a deft comic actress.&quot;106 The Los Angeles Times calls the film an &quot;anti-romantic romantic comedy&quot; and cites the scenario in which Johansson appears with Jennifer Connelly and Bradley Cooper as having &quot;more meat than others&quot;, making it &quot;one of the best.&quot;107 The Baltimore Sun criticized the film, saying, &quot;[It] stumbles somewhat when it tries to get serious&quot;, but praised Johansson for &quot;proving she doesn't need Woody Allen to be funny.&quot;108
In March 2009, Johansson signed on to play Natasha Romanoff in Iron Man 2109 after a scheduling conflict forced Emily Blunt to drop out of the part.110 The film, released in May 2010, was directed by Jon Favreau and also starred Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Mickey Rourke, Samuel L. Jackson and Sam Rockwell.111 Appearing at Comic-Con in San Diego, California on July 26, 2009, Johansson joked about her audition for the film, saying it consisted of &quot;a couple of deep knee bends and lunges&quot;, but Favreau credited her with performing her own stunts: &quot;All the fighting and wire work is her own. She worked really hard and it shows on the screen.&quot;112
Theatre
Johansson made her first stage appearance in the Off Broadway play Sophistry.113 In 2009, Johansson made her debut on Broadway, as Catherine Carbone in the drama A View from the Bridge, written by Arthur Miller and directed by Gregory Mosher. Liev Schreiber played opposite her.114 Johansson was nominated for and won the 2010 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play for her role in the play.115
Endorsements
Johansson has appeared in advertising campaigns for Calvin Klein, L'Or&lt;U+00E9&gt;al, Louis Vuitton116 and has been the face of Spanish brand Mango since 2009.117 After appearing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala with Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, Johansson was announced as the face of the new Dolce &amp; Gabbana make-up collection in early 2009.118 She made a personal appearance at the London store, Selfridges, on July 31, 2009, to help launch and promote the line.119
Music career
In 2005, Johansson was considered for the role of Maria120 in Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End revival of The Sound of Music, though the role ultimately went to newcomer Connie Fisher after she won BBC's talent show How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?121 Released on May 8, 2006, Johansson sang the track &quot;Summertime&quot; for Unexpected Dreams &lt;U+2013&gt; Songs From the Stars, a non-profit collection of songs recorded by Hollywood actors. She performed with The Jesus and Mary Chain for a special Coachella Reunion Show in Indio, California in April 2007.122

In 2007, she appeared as the leading lady in Justin Timberlake's music video, for &quot;What Goes Around.../...Comes Around&quot;, which was nominated in August 2007 for video of the year at the MTV Video Music Awards.123
In mid-2007, Johansson spent about a month in Maurice, Louisiana recording an album at Dockside Studio, a rural  complex.124 The album, consisting of one original song and ten cover versions of Tom Waits songs,125126 was produced by Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio and features David Bowie,127 members from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs128 and Celebration.129130 Released on May 20, 2008, it was entitled Anywhere I Lay My Head.131132 Reviews of the album were mixed, or average.133 Spin commented, &quot;There's nothing particularly compelling about Scarlett Johansson's singing.&quot;134 Conversely, some critics found it to be &quot;surprisingly alluring&quot;,135 &quot;a bravely eccentric selection&quot;,136 and &quot;a brilliant album&quot; with &quot;ghostly magic&quot;.137 The album was named the &quot;23rd best album of 2008&quot; by NME138 and peaked at #1 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart and #126 on the Billboard 200 chart.139 Of her album, Johansson said, &quot;I had this golden opportunity to record and thought I would do maybe an album of standards, because I&lt;U+2019&gt;m not a songwriter. I&lt;U+2019&gt;m a vocalist.&quot;140 Johansson said for her recording she &quot;wanted to have space and [she] wanted to be in a remote place where all of us could just be ourselves and not worry about anyone trying to listen in or get in on that.&quot;141 Johansson said in an interview that she started listening to Tom Waits when she was 11 or 12.142 Of Tom Waits, Johansson said in an interview, &quot;His melodies are so beautiful, his voice is so distinct and I had my own way of doing Tom Waits songs.&quot;143 In December 2008, MTV reported Johansson planned to follow-up Anywhere I Lay My Head with an album of all original music, saying, &lt;U+201C&gt;I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t think I&lt;U+2019&gt;d do covers, so it&lt;U+2019&gt;d be a project that I have to dedicate myself to. I feel like that&lt;U+2019&gt;s something for the future.&lt;U+201D&gt;144
In 2009, Johansson covered Jeff Buckley's &quot;Last Goodbye&quot; for the soundtrack of He's Just Not That Into You.145 Released on September 8, 2009, she and singer/songwriter Pete Yorn recorded a collaborative album, Break Up, inspired by Serge Gainsbourg's duets with Brigitte Bardot.146
In 2010, Steel Train released Terrible Thrills Vol. 1, which includes their favourite female artists singing songs from their self-titled album. Johansson is the first artist on the album, singing &quot;Bullet&quot;.
Regarded as sex symbol
Johansson is considered a &quot;peerless sex symbol&quot; by Channel 4,147 and she regularly appears at the top of lists of the sexiest women in the world. Johansson appeared on the cover of the March 2006 issue of Vanity Fair in the nude alongside actress Keira Knightley and fashion designer Tom Ford.148 Maxim named Johansson #6 in their Hot 100 Issue in 2006;149 #3 in 2007150 and #2 in 2008.151 In November 2006, Johansson was named &quot;Sexiest Woman Alive&quot; by Esquire.152 In February 2007, she was named the &quot;Sexiest Celebrity&quot; of the year by Playboy.153 During the filming of Match Point, director Woody Allen described Johansson as &quot;sexually overwhelming&quot;, saying that he found it &quot;very hard to be extra witty around a sexually overwhelming, beautiful young woman who is wittier than you are.&quot;154 In 2010, GQ Magazine named Johansson its Babe of The Year.155
Personal life
Johansson rarely discusses her personal life with the press, saying, &quot;It's nice to have everybody not know your business.&quot;156
She has been linked to many famous men, including Benicio del Toro,157 Jared Leto,158 Justin Timberlake,159 and her Black Dahlia co-star Josh Hartnett, though Johansson denies she had a relationship with del Toro.160 Johansson and Hartnett dated for about two years until the end of 2006, with Hartnett citing their busy lives as the reason for the split.161

Scarlett Johansson with Michael Caine at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert 2008

In a 2006 interview, Johansson expressed a concern about the potential conflict between the nature of human beings and the concept of monogamy.162 However, she has stated &quot;contrary to popular belief ... [I am] not promiscuous&quot; and that she works &quot;really hard&quot; when she's in a relationship &quot;to make it work in a monogamous way.&quot;163 She gets tested for HIV twice a year and has said, &quot;It's part of being a decent human [and it is] just disgusting behavior when people don't. It's so irresponsible.&quot;164
She started dating Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds in 2007,165 and on May 5, 2008, it was reported that the two were engaged.166 On September 27, 2008, Johansson and Reynolds were married at a quiet ceremony near Tofino, British Columbia.167 They purchased a $2.8 million home together near Los Angeles, California.168 On December 14, 2010, Reynolds and Johansson announced that they had separated, saying &quot;after long and careful consideration on both our parts, we've decided to end our marriage...We entered our relationship with love and it's with love and kindness we leave it.&quot;169 Reynolds filed for divorce on December 23, 2010 in Los Angeles, citing irreconcilable differences. Johansson filed her divorce response simultaneously.170
She has criticized the media and Hollywood for promoting an image that causes unhealthy diets and eating disorders among women, saying, &quot;Being ultra-thin is not sexy at all. Women shouldn't be forced to conform to unrealistic and unhealthy body images that the media promote.&quot;171
About her religious affiliation, Johansson described herself as Jewish when she was talking about Woody Allen: &quot;I just adore Woody,&quot; she says. &quot;We have a lot in common. We're New Yorkers, Jewish. We have a very easygoing relationship.&quot;172 She celebrates a &quot;little of both&quot; referring to Christmas and Hanukkah.173 She has stated that she dislikes it when celebrities thank God or Jesus in their award acceptance speeches.174
Johansson is a Global Ambassador for the aid and development agency, Oxfam.175 In March 2008, a UK-based bidder paid &lt;U+00A3&gt;20,000 on an eBay auction to benefit Oxfam, winning a hair and makeup treatment, a pair of tickets and a chauffered trip to accompany Johansson on a 20-minute date to the world premiere of He's Just Not That Into You.176
Political advocacy
Johansson is registered as an independent177 and campaigned for Democratic candidate John Kerry in the 2004 United States presidential election.178 About George W. Bush's reelection, she said, &quot;[I am] disappointed. I think it was a disappointment for a large percentage of the population.&quot;179 Johansson also campaigned for Democratic candidate Barack Obama:180 her efforts included appearances in Iowa during January 2008, where her efforts were targeted at younger voters;181 an appearance at Cornell College; 182 and a speaking engagement at Carleton College, in Northfield, Minnesota, on Super Tuesday, 2008.183 Johansson appeared in the 2008 music video for Black Eyed Peas front man Will.i.am's song, &quot;Yes We Can&quot;, directed by Jesse Dylan, a song inspired by Obama's speech following the 2008 New Hampshire primary.184 In addition to her political advocacy, Johansson has taken part in social advocacy as part of the anti-poverty campaign ONE which was organized by U2 lead singer Bono.185
