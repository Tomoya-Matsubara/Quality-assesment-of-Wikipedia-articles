The Committee of Secretaries-General lang-fr Comit des Scretaires-gnraux, lang-nl Comit van de secretarissen-generaal was a Belgium Belgian Technocracy technocratic administrative panel created during World War II. The Committee comprised the head civil servants of most government ministries who each held the title Secretary-General and formed an part of the German occupation administration of Belgium between 1940 and 1944, being an integral role in the Belgian policy of lesser evil collaboration. From August 1940, the Germans began introducing new members, and by 1941 its composition was almost completely different. Among those promoted were pro-Germans like Victor Leemans and Grard Romse, who had been involved in Belgian Fascist movements before the war. They helped to facilitate the more radical administrative reforms demanded by the Germans, although the Committee refused to involve itself in the The Holocaust in Belgium deportation of Belgian Jews. As the visible face of the German administration, the Committee became more and more unpopular as the war progressed. Following the Allies World War II Allied liberation of Belgium in 1944, several members of the Committee were prosecuted for collaboration but several members, including Leemans, went on to political careers in post-war Belgium.

Background
The Committee was installed by the Belgian government of Hubert Pierlot on 16 May 1940 as an administrative committee to oversee the basic functioning of the Belgian state in the absence of the official government.cite book last1=Van den Wijngaert first1=Mark last2=Dujardin first2=Vincent title=La Belgique sans Roi, 19401950 work=Nouvelle Historie de Belgique, 19051950 vol.2 year=2006 publisher=d. Complexe location=Brussels isbn=2-8048-0078-4 pages=1920 While the ministers departed for Bordeaux in French Third Republic France, the Secretaries-General chief civil servants responsible for each department of each ministry were ordered to remain in the country, along with all other civil servants, to allow the state to continue functioning.

The Committee formed part of the policy of officially sanctioned lesser evil collaboration among the civil service and government bureaus left behind.#tag:ref The basis of the policy of lesser-evil Moindre-mal was that continued control over state functions and the normal operation of the government was the best way to preserve Belgian interests. The same policy formed the basis of the Galopin doctrine, which allowed limited collaboration in order to avoid potential German reprisals or post-war industrial decline. group=note

Purpose and role
During the Rape of Belgium German occupation of Belgium in World War I, many Belgian workers had refused to work for the German administration as a form of Non-violent resistance passive resistance. This had led to large-scale reprisals against civilians as the occupiers had attempted to enforce their policies by armed force.cite book last=Kossmann first=E.H. title=The Low Countries: 17801940 year=1978 pages=5259 isbn=0198221088 location=Oxford publisher=Oxford University Press

The Committee hoped to avoid the Germans becoming involved in the day-to-day administration of the territory as they had during World War I, while also allowing Belgium to maintain a degree of national autonomy and independence.cite book last1=Van den Wijngaert first1=Mark last2=Dujardin first2=Vincent title=La Belgique sans Roi, 19401950 work=Nouvelle Historie de Belgique, 19051950 vol.2 year=2006 publisher=d. Complexe location=Brussels isbn=2-8048-0078-4 pages=206 The Committee also hoped to be able to prevent the implementation of more radical German policies, like forced labour and deportation. The legal basis of the Committee was a law of 7 September 1939, through which in times of crisis, a Secretary-General could exert full control over his own department, but without having the full status of being a minister.

Place within the German administration
After the Belgian surrender on 28 May 1940, the Germans formed a Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France Militrverwaltung Military Administration in the country; commanded by the German aristocrat and career soldier, General Alexander von Falkenhausen.cite journal last=Geller first=Jay Howard title=The Role of Military Administration in German-occupied Belgium, 19401944 journal=Journal of Military History year=1999 month=January volume=63 issue=1 page=99 issn=0899-3718 A section of the administration called the Militrverwaltungsstab Military Administrative Staff military Staff, commanded by SS-Gruppenfhrer Eggert Reeder, was reponsable for the day-to-day civil administration of the territory. The Militrverwaltungsstab would present its demands to the Secretaries-General, even though the Committee was separate, in order to have them carried out.cite book last=Lemkin first=Raphal title=Axis rule in occupied Europe: Laws of Occupation; Analysis of Government; Proposals for Redress publisher=Lawbook Exchange location=New Jersey year=2005 page=12 isbn=1584775769

Composition
The original committee of five was installed after the departure of the government in May 1940. In August 1940, they were joined by a further five new Secretaries-General representing other ministries. In early 1941, there was a reshuffle, replacing many of the original members. The 1941 reshuffle introduced more pro-Germans into the committee, such as Grard Romse who was a noted member of the pro-Nazi lang nl Flemish National Union Vlaams Nationaal Verbond VNV party.

Policies
Throughout 1940 the Secretaries-General continued to follow their policy of lesser-evils, influenced by the Galopin doctrine, in the hope that the occupiers would respect the protocol established at the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions of 1907. 

From the summer of 1940, the Committee became increasingly divided between the members keen for closer collaboration with the Germans, led by Victor Leemans, and those who wished to remain strictly within the proscribed Belgian legal framework, led by Ernst de Bunswyck. In October 1940, the Germans were able to pass fundamental changes to the system of regional Burgomasters in the country though the Committee without resistance. The Committee had announced in October 1940 that it would refuse to enforce anti-Jewish legislation, but did not resist their implementation by the military government.cite book editor1-last=Gotovitch  editor1-first=Jos  editor2-last=Aron editor2-first=Paul title=Dictionnaire de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale en Belgique year=2008 publisher=Andr Versaille d. location=Brussels isbn=978-2-87495-001-8 page=412 The Committee's ambivalent stance meant that Belgian policemen and civil servants were not instructed to refuse to participate in rounding-up of Jews as part of the Final Solution from 1942. Tensions grew between the Germans and the committee in December 1940, and in early 1941 the Germans reshuffled the committee; appointing more pro-Nazi members. From March 1941, it became clear that the Committee would no longer be able to resist German demands, even those clearly violating the Hague Convention.

From 1942, collaborationist members of the Committee were able to further their policies. In Internal Affairs, Romse began encouraging an overtly collaborationist policy in his department, encouraging Burgomaster positions to be given to pro-Nazi members of the right-wing lang fr Rexism Rex and VNV parties in Wallonia and Flanders respectively. Many existing Burgomasters were dismissed on a variety of pretexts in order to clear the path for the new candidates. He also appointed the pro-German Emiel Van Coppenolle also a friend of Romse to the head of the Belgian police service. These measures gave the pro-German members of the Committee direct control over the country's local government, its police force and security service. At the same time, Leemans encouraged the merger of various Central offices to co-ordinate industries along lines of the pre-war Gleichschaltung in Germany and greater economic integration into the lang de Groraumwirtschaft Greater Economy and Nazi Germany. Other members of the Committee were also responsible for creating other groupings, like the lang fr Office National de Travail ONT; National Office for Work which would be used for coordinating the deportation of Belgian workers to factories in Germany from October 1942.

In October 1942, the Germans began to implement compulsory deportation of Belgian workers to work in German factories. The introduction of the policy, which had been imposed in World War I and which the Committee had hoped to avoid at all costs, marked the last blow to the Committee's influence.cite journal last=Strikwerda first=Carl title=The German Occupation of Belgium 1940-1944 by Werner Warmbrunn review journal=Central European History volume=27 number=4 year=1994 location=Cambridge page=550 issn=0008-9389

Legislation decreed the Secretaries-General are known as Arrtes Rulings, whereas those decreed by the Military Administration directly are entitled Ordonnances Orders.cite book last=Wullus-Rudiger first=J.A. title=La Belgique et la Crise Europene, 19141945 volume=II: 19401945 year=1945 publisher=d.

Criticism
Despite its aims, the Committee was in large part responsible for the ease with which the Germans could implement their policies in Belgium and was unable to moderate many German policies, such as Forced labour under German rule during World War II deportation of workers to Germany though delayed to October 1942 or the The Holocaust in Belgium persecution of Jews. In particular, encouraging the Germans to delegate tasks to the Committee meant that the Germans were effectively using the established national civil service, which allowed much more efficient implementation than could have been achieved by force. Since Belgium was also dependent on Germany for the imports of food it needed, the Committee was always at a disadvantage during negotiations.

The Committee was heavily criticised by the Belgian government in exile in London for aiding the Germans.cite book editor1-last=Gotovitch  editor1-first=Jos  editor2-last=Aron editor2-first=Paul title=Dictionnaire de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale en Belgique year=2008 publisher=Andr Versaille d. location=Brussels isbn=978-2-87495-001-8 page=410cite book last=Grosbois first=Thierry title=Pierlot, 19301950 year=1998 location=Brussels publisher=Racine isbn=2-87386-485-0 pages=2712 The Secretaries-General were also unpopular within Belgium itself. In 1942, the journalist Paul Struye described them as the object of growing and almost unanimous unpopularity.cite book last1=Jacquemyns first1=Guillaume last2=Struye first2=Paul authorlink2=Paul Struye title=La Belgique sous l'Occupation Allemande: 19401944 year=2002 publisher=d. Complexe location=Brussels isbn=2-87027-940-X page=141 edition=Rev. As the face of the German occupation authority, they also became unpopular with the public, which blamed them for the German demands they were implementing.

After the war, several of the Secretaries-General were tried for collaboration with the occupants. Most were acquitted after basic examination. Romse Secretary-General for Internal Affairs was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment and Schuind responable for Justice was sentenced to five years'.cite book editor1-last=Gotovitch  editor1-first=Jos  editor2-last=Aron editor2-first=Paul title=Dictionnaire de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale en Belgique year=2008 publisher=Andr Versaille d. location=Brussels isbn=978-2-87495-001-8 pages=4123 Many of the former Secretaries-General went on to careers in politics after the war. Both De Winter and Leemans served as a Senate Belgium senators for the centre-right Christian Social Party Belgium, defunct Christian Social Party PSC-CVP and Leemans ended his career as President of the European Parliament.cite book last=Beke first=Wouter title=De Ziel van eel Zuil: de Christelijke Volkspartij 19451968 publisher=Catholic University of Leuven year=2005 location=Leuven page=363 isbn=9058674983
