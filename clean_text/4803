is a Japanese adult video (AV) production company located in Tokyo, Japan.1
Company information
Attackers started as an independent (&quot;indie&quot;) studio2 but is now one of the companies that make up the large AV group, the Hokuto Corporation, which distributes Attackers video products through their DMM website.3 The Attackers studio released its first four videos (with themes of sexual violence and rape) in February 1997 on the Shark label numbered SHK-001 to SHK-004.45 Among early Attackers stars performing on the Shark label in the late 1990s were AV Idols Sally Yoshino, Ky&lt;U+014D&gt;ko Kazama and Yuri Komuro.6
The studio also started another imprint, Idea Pocket, to market its softer Angel series of cosplay videos which were first released in December 19987 including one, Angel 9, which starred Sally Yoshino.8 Idea Pocket later split off to become an independent company.9
The company specializes in videos portraying simulated rape, torture and bondage.10 The two main bondage genre labels are Jabaku (&lt;U+86C7&gt;&lt;U+7E1B&gt;) and Ryubaku (&lt;U+9F8D&gt;&lt;U+7E1B&gt;). The Jabaku series often stars well-known actresses and uses high production values and elaborate sets. The emphasis is on bondage and gagging with some light S&amp;M.11 The Ryubaku label was introduced in 2000 as a softer version of the Jabaku line with more consensual action and fantasy role-playing.12
The studio usually releases a total of about 10-15 original and compilation videos per month13 and by September 2011, the AV distributor DMM (a division of the Hokuto Corporation) listed over 1500 Attackers titles in their catalog.14 The general manager of the company is Michio Maruyama (&lt;U+4E38&gt;&lt;U+5C71&gt;&lt;U+9053&gt;&lt;U+592E&gt;).15
