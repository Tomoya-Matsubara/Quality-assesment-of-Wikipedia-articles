is one of the  fictional species of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon creatures from the multi-billion-dollar1 Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon media franchise – a collection of video games, anime, manga, books, trading cards and other media created by Satoshi Tajiri. Mudkip are famous for being one of the three species of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon players can choose from at the beginning of their adventure in the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Ruby &amp; Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Sapphire and Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Emerald versions of the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon series. The purpose of Mudkip in the games, anime and manga, as with all other Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, is to battle both wild Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, untamed creatures encountered while the player passes through various environments, and tamed Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon owned by Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon trainers.2
Mudkip's name is a portmanteau of mud, being a surrounding of its natural habitat, and &quot;Kip&quot;, which refers to &quot;Skip&quot;, relating to the Mudskipper, the fish it resembles.3 The &quot;-kip&quot; may also come from the fish-species Kipper. The name Mudkip refers to both the overall species, and to individual Mudkip within the games, anime and manga series. Its Japanese name is likely a portmanteau of , water, and , Mudskipper.
Characteristics
The fin on Mudkip's head acts as highly sensitive radar. Using this fin to sense movements of water and air, Mudkip can determine what is taking place around it without using its eyes. When in water, Mudkip breathes using the gills on its cheeks. On land, it can powerfully lift large boulders by planting its four feet and heaving. It sleeps by burying itself in soil at the water's edge. Its large tail fin propels it through water with powerful acceleration. If it is faced with a tight situation in battle, Mudkip will become strong enough to crush rocks bigger than itself.4
In the video games
One of the consistent aspects of most Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon games &lt;U+2014&gt; spanning from Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Red and Blue on the Nintendo Game Boy to the un-released Nintendo DS game, Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Diamond and Pearl &lt;U+2014&gt; is the choice of three different Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon at the start of the player's adventures; these three are often labelled Starter Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon. Players can choose a Water-type, a Fire-type, or a Grass-type Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon indigenous to that particular region5; an exception to this rule is Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Yellow (a remake of the original games that follows the story of the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon anime), where players are given a Pikachu, an Electric-type mouse famous for being the mascot of the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon media franchise.6

Mudkip is the Water-type choice in [[Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Ruby and Sapphire|Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Ruby]], Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Sapphire and Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Emerald for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance.7 Choosing one as the player's starting Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon is considered easier than choosing the Fire-type (Torchic), but equally as difficult as choosing the Grass-type (Treecko), primarily because of the advantage it has in defeating the first Gym-leader, Roxanne, a powerful trainer whom the player must defeat to progress in the game.8 Roxanne uses Rock-type Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon &lt;U+2014&gt; such as Geodude &lt;U+2014&gt; that have a natural weakness to Grass and Water attacks.910
It is a Water-type Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, meaning it specialzes in firing water (in bubbles or in jet spurts) to attack foe. Mudkip evolves, a metamorphic change within a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon caused by gaining experience in battle,11 into Marshtomp, its Stage-1 (middle) form at level 16, and evolves into its Stage-2 (final) form, Swampert, at Level 36.12 Mudkip is often chosen as a starter because its evolved forms, Marshtomp and Swampert are Water-type and Ground-type, meaning they specialize in ground-based moves as well as water-based moves. Being part ground-type gives Swampert and Marshtomp immunity to electricity-based moves, which water types would normally take a lot of damage from. Also, Swampert is considered an &quot;overused Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon&quot;, meaning that it is used very often in battles.13
One interesting thing about Mudkip is that its evolved forms, Marshtomp and Swampert, cannot learn Hydro Pump, which is a powerful water-based attack. On the other hand, Mudkip would learn this move at Level 42.14
Mudkip is also one of the main characters in Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Mystery Dungeon, for the Nintendo DS and Nintendo Game Boy Advance. At the beginning of the game, the player takes a personality quiz. Depending on the answers to the questions, the player could begin the game as one of many characters, including Pikachu, Bulbasaur and Mudkip. If Bulbasaur or another Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon is selected as the player, however, Mudkip can become one of the player's &quot;partners&quot; at the beginning of the game.15
In the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon anime

The Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon anime series and films are a set of adventures separate from most other versions of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, featuring Ash Ketchum as the main character, and various companions that accompany him through the lands of Kanto, Johto and Hoenn. During the Hoenn adventures, Brock, a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon breeder and former Gym leader who travels with protagonist Ash Ketchum, obtains a Mudkip in Dewford Town during Episode 301. &quot;A Mudkip Mission&quot;. As Ash and his companions climb a waterfall, they come across a group of young Mudkip, Brock rescues a young Mudkip from being washed away in a stream. Brock's Lotad and Mudkip work together to defeat Team Rocket, at which point the Mudkip decides to join Brock's team.16
Mudkip's primary role is to assist Brock during water related situations, such as searching for objects in the ocean, such as an Illumise and a pearl belonging to a Spoink.1718 Mudkip also guides the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon when Brock, Ash and May aren't around. It evolves into Marshtomp during Episode 425, entitled &quot;Mudkip &amp; Flaafy! Wonder Drug of Love!&quot;.19
A separate Mudkip also appears in Episode 281 &quot;In the Knicker of Time!&quot;, when the group meet a trainer called Nicolai, a young trainer, who is training his first Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, Mudkip, which later defeats May's Torchic in a battle. Nicolai connects with his Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon in battle by dressing up in a suit resembling his Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, wearing both Mudkip and Zigzagoon outfits in the episode.20
In the TCG
 The Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Trading Card Game is a collectable card game first published by Wizards of the Coast in North America, in 1999. The concept is similar to that of a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon battle in the video games in that each player takes turns to hit the opponent&lt;U+2019&gt;s Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon. In the card game, Mudkip is a Water-type Basic pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, just like its video game counterparts. As a basic pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, it can be played in a battle, as the competitions of the card game are called, without the use of a special card. If the player has a Marshtomp card in their hand, they can play it on top of the Mudkip card, which is the card game's equivalent of evolving.
Mudkip has appeared several times in the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Trading Card Game. It has appeared in the sets EX Ruby &amp; Sapphire (two different cards), EX Dragon, and EX Emerald. It also appears in EX Team Rocket Returns, but as &quot;Mudkip Star&quot;.21 This card is different then the other Mudkip cards in that it is rarer than the rest of the cards in the set.22
One rule when playing with Star cards &lt;U+2014&gt; including Mudkip Star from the EX Team Rocket Returns set &lt;U+2014&gt; is that Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon with significant terms in their titles (often used to denote Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon that are all part of one set) can only evolve into Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon that also share this term. Though there is no mention on how to evolve Star Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, if the rule for other suffixes is followed, Mudkip Star could only be replaced by a Marshtomp card with Star in its title &lt;U+2014&gt; a card which, at this point, does not exist.23 However, since players can only have one &quot;Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Star&quot; card in their deck, then they couldn't evolve Mudkip Star into Marshtomp Star. This makes Star cards somewhat impractical, since they cannot be upgraded from their Basic stage state; they are primarily savoured for their rarity instead.24
In the manga
Ruby, the male protagonist in Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Adventures during the arc based off of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Ruby and Sapphire, obtains a Mudkip named Zuzu as his Starter Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon from Professor Birch. Ruby is a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon coordinator, a person who uses their Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon for contests rather than battles, and uses Zuzu in those contests. Zuzu evolved into a Marshtomp unexpectedly while Ruby was in Slateport City, and again into a Swampert, while training near Fortree City. Zuzu was first used to battle in &quot;Chapter 183 VS. Torchic&quot;, against Sapphire, his rival in the manga.25
