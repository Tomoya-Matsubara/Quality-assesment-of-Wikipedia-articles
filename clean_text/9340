Manchester ()1 is a city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England, with an estimated population of 512,000.2 It lies within the Greater Manchester Built-up Area, the United Kingdom's second most populous urban area, which has a population of 2,553,379.3 Manchester is located in the south-central part of North West England, fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south and the Pennines to the north and east, and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation. The local authority is Manchester City Council, and the city's inhabitants are referred to as Mancunians .
The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium, which was established in c. 79 AD on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell. Historically, Manchester was in Lancashire, although areas of Cheshire, south of the River Mersey were incorporated into the city during the 20th century.4 Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township but began to expand &quot;at an astonishing rate&quot; around the turn of the 19th century. Manchester's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution,5 and resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialised city.6 The building of the Bridgewater Canal in 1761 built to transport coal triggered an early-19th-century factory building boom which transformed Manchester from a township into a major mill town and borough that was granted city status in 1853. In 1877, the Neo Gothic Manchester Town Hall was built and in 1894 the 36 mile Manchester Ship Canal opened; which at the time was the longest river navigation canal in the world, which in turn created the Port of Manchester linking the city to sea. Manchester's fortunes decreased in the subsequent years after WW2 due to deindustrialization however investment in the last two decades spurred by the 1996 Manchester bombing- which was the largest bomb ever detonated in peacetime Britain- spearheaded extensive regeneration of Manchester.
Today Manchester is ranked as a beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network;7 The city is notable for its architecture, culture, music scene, media links, scientific and engineering output, social impact and sporting connections. Sports clubs which bear the city name include Premier League football teams, Manchester City and Manchester United.8 Manchester was the site of the world's first railway station, and the place where scientists first split the atom and developed the first stored-programme computer. Manchester is served by two universities, including the largest single-site university in the UK, and has the country's third largest urban economy.9 As of 2011 Manchester is the fastest growing major city in the UK 10 and the third-most visited city in the UK by foreign visitors, after London and Edinburgh, and the most visited in England outside London.11
History

Etymology
The name Manchester originates from the Ancient Roman name Mamucium, the name of the Roman fort and settlement, generally thought to be a Latinisation of an original Celtic name (possibly meaning &quot;breast-like hill&quot; from mamm- = &quot;breast&quot;), with later added Old English ceaster = &quot;town&quot; (which is derived from Latin castra = &quot;camp&quot; or &quot;forts&quot;).12 An alternative theory suggests that the origin is Brythonic mamma = &quot;mother&quot;, where the &quot;mother&quot; was a river-goddess of the River Medlock which flows below the fort. Mam means &quot;female breast&quot; in Irish Gaelic and &quot;mother&quot; in Welsh.13
Early history
The Brigantes were the major Celtic tribe in what is now Northern England; they had a stronghold in the locality at a sandstone outcrop on which Manchester Cathedral now stands, opposite the banks of the River Irwell.14 Their territory extended across the fertile lowland of what is now Salford and Stretford. Following the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century, General Agricola ordered the construction of a Roman fort named Mamucium in the year 79 to ensure that Roman interests in Deva Victrix (Chester) and Eboracum (York) were protected from the Brigantes.15 Central Manchester has been permanently settled since this time.16 A stabilised fragment of foundations of the final version of the Roman fort is visible in Castlefield. The Roman habitation of Manchester probably ended around the 3rd century; the vicus, or civilian settlement, appears to have been abandoned by the mid-3rd century, although the fort may have supported a small garrison until the late 3rd or early 4th century.17 By the time of the Norman Conquest in 1066, the focus of settlement had shifted to the confluence of the rivers Irwell and Irk.18 Much of the wider area was laid waste in the subsequent Harrying of the North.1920
 Thomas de la Warre, lord of the manor, founded and constructed a collegiate church for the parish in 1421. The church is now Manchester Cathedral; the domestic premises of the college house Chetham's School of Music and Chetham's Library.2122 The library, which opened in 1653 and is still open to the public today, is the oldest free public reference library in the United Kingdom.23
Manchester is mentioned as having a market in 1282.24 Around the 14th century, Manchester received an influx of Flemish weavers, sometimes credited as the foundation of the region's textile industry.25 Manchester became an important centre for the manufacture and trade of woollens and linen, and by about 1540, had expanded to become, in John Leland's words, &quot;The fairest, best builded, quickest, and most populous town of all Lancashire.&quot;26 The cathedral and Chetham's buildings are the only significant survivors of Leland's Manchester.27
 During the English Civil War, Manchester strongly favoured the Parliamentary interest. Although not long lasting, Cromwell granted it the right to elect its own MP. Charles Worsley, who sat for the city for only a year, was later appointed Major General for Lancashire, Cheshire and Staffordshire during the Rule of the Major Generals. He was a diligent puritan, turning out ale houses and banning the celebration of Christmas; he died in 1656.28
Significant quantities of cotton began to be used after about 1600, firstly in linen/cotton fustians, but by around 1750 pure cotton fabrics were being produced and cotton had overtaken wool in importance.29 The Irwell and Mersey were made navigable by 1736, opening a route from Manchester to the sea docks on the Mersey. The Bridgewater Canal, Britain's first wholly artificial waterway, was opened in 1761, bringing coal from mines at Worsley to central Manchester. The canal was extended to the Mersey at Runcorn by 1776. The combination of competition and improved efficiency halved the cost of coal and halved the transport cost of raw cotton.3031 Manchester became the dominant marketplace for textiles produced in the surrounding towns.32 A commodities exchange, opened in 1729,33 and numerous large warehouses, aided commerce.
In 1780, Richard Arkwright began construction of Manchester's first cotton mill.3435
Industrial Revolution

Cotton mills in Ancoats about 1820

Manchester's history is concerned with textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. The great majority of cotton spinning took place in the towns of south Lancashire and north Cheshire, and Manchester was for a time the most productive centre of cotton processing,36 and later the world's largest marketplace for cotton goods.3738 Manchester was dubbed &quot;Cottonopolis&quot; and &quot;Warehouse City&quot; during the Victorian era.39 In Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the term &quot;manchester&quot; is still used for household linen: sheets, pillow cases, towels, etc.40 The industrial revolution brought about huge change in Manchester and was key to the increase in Manchester's population.
Manchester began expanding &quot;at an astonishing rate&quot; around the turn of the 19th century as people flocked to the city for work from Scotland, Wales, Ireland and other areas of England as part of a process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by the Industrial Revolution.414243 It developed a wide range of industries, so that by 1835 &quot;Manchester was without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world.&quot;44 Engineering firms initially made machines for the cotton trade, but diversified into general manufacture. Similarly, the chemical industry started by producing bleaches and dyes, but expanded into other areas. Commerce was supported by financial service industries such as banking and insurance. Trade, and feeding the growing population, required a large transport and distribution infrastructure: the canal system was extended, and Manchester became one end of the world's first intercity passenger railway&lt;U+2014&gt;the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Competition between the various forms of transport kept costs down.45 In 1878 the GPO (the forerunner of British Telecom) provided its first telephones to a firm in Manchester.46
The Manchester Ship Canal was built in 1894, in some sections by canalisation of the Rivers Irwell and Mersey, running 47 from Salford to Eastham Locks on the tidal Mersey. This enabled ocean going ships to sail right into the Port of Manchester. On the canal's banks, just outside the borough, the world's first industrial estate was created at Trafford Park.48 Large quantities of machinery, including cotton processing plant, were exported around the world.
A centre of capitalism, Manchester was once the scene of bread and labour riots, as well as calls for greater political recognition by the city's working and non-titled classes. One such gathering ended with the Peterloo Massacre of 16 August 1819. The economic school of Manchester capitalism developed there, and Manchester was the centre of the Anti-Corn Law League from 1838 onward.
 Manchester has a notable place in the history of Marxism and left-wing politics; being the subject of Friedrich Engels' work The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844; Engels spent much of his life in and around Manchester,49 and when Karl Marx visited Manchester, they met at Chetham's Library. The economics books Marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet.50 The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.51
At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen&lt;U+2014&gt;new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: &quot;What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow.&quot;52 Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hall&lt;U+00E9&gt; Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy. 
Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian Simon Schama noted that &quot;Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke&quot;. An American visitor taken to Manchester&lt;U+2019&gt;s blackspots saw &quot;wretched, defrauded, oppressed, crushed human nature, lying and bleeding fragments&quot;.53
The number of cotton mills in Manchester itself reached a peak of 108 in 1853.54 Thereafter the number began to decline and Manchester was surpassed as the largest centre of cotton spinning by Bolton in the 1850s and Oldham in the 1860s.55 However, this period of decline coincided with the rise of city as the financial centre of the region.56 Manchester continued to process cotton, and in 1913, 65% of the world's cotton was processed in the area.57 The First World War interrupted access to the export markets. Cotton processing in other parts of the world increased, often on machines produced in Manchester. Manchester suffered greatly from the Great Depression and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries, including textile manufacture.
The Second World War and the Manchester Blitz
Like most of the UK, the Manchester area mobilised extensively during the Second World War. For example, casting and machining expertise at Beyer, Peacock and Company's locomotive works in Gorton was switched to bomb making; Dunlop's rubber works in Chorlton-on-Medlock made barrage balloons; and just outside the city in Trafford Park, engineers Metropolitan-Vickers made Avro Manchester and Avro Lancaster bombers and Ford built the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines to power them. Manchester was thus the target of bombing by the Luftwaffe, and by late 1940 air raids were taking place against non-military targets. The biggest took place during the &quot;Christmas Blitz&quot; on the nights of 22/23 and 24 December 1940, when an estimated  of high explosives plus over 37,000 incendiary bombs were dropped. A large part of the historic city centre was destroyed, including 165 warehouses, 200 business premises, and 150 offices. 376 were killed and 30,000 houses were damaged.58 Manchester Cathedral was among the buildings seriously damaged; its restoration took 20 years.59
Post-Second World War
Cotton processing and trading continued to fall in peacetime, and the exchange closed in 1968.60 By 1963 the port of Manchester was the UK's third largest,61 and employed over 3,000 men, but the canal was unable to handle the increasingly large container ships. Traffic declined, and the port closed in 1982.62 Heavy industry suffered a downturn from the 1960s and was greatly reduced under the economic policies followed by Margaret Thatcher's government after 1979. Manchester lost 150,000 jobs in manufacturing between 1961 and 1983.63
 Regeneration began in the late 1980s, with initiatives such as the Metrolink, the Bridgewater Concert Hall, the Phones 4u Arena, and (in Salford) the rebranding of the port as Salford Quays. Two bids to host the Olympic Games were part of a process to raise the international profile of the city.64
Manchester has a history of attacks attributed to Irish Republicans, including the Manchester Martyrs of 1867, arson in 1920, a series of explosions in 1939, and two bombs in 1992. On Saturday 15 June 1996, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) carried out the 1996 Manchester bombing, the detonation of a large bomb next to a department store in the city centre. The largest to be detonated on British soil, the bomb injured over 200 people, heavily damaged nearby buildings, and broke windows half a mile away. The cost of the immediate damage was initially estimated at &lt;U+00A3&gt;50 million, but this was quickly revised upwards.65 The final insurance payout was over &lt;U+00A3&gt;400 million; many affected businesses never recovered from the loss of trade.66
Spurred by the investment after the 1996 bomb, and aided by the XVII Commonwealth Games, Manchester's city centre has undergone extensive regeneration.67 New and renovated complexes such as The Printworks and The Triangle have become popular shopping and entertainment destinations. The Manchester Arndale is the UK's largest city centre shopping mall.68 
Large sections of the city dating from the 1960s have been either demolished and re-developed or modernised with the use of glass and steel. Old mills have been converted into modern apartments, Hulme has undergone extensive regeneration programmes, and million-pound lofthouse apartments have since been developed. The 169-metre tall, 47-storey Beetham Tower, completed in 2006, is the tallest building in the UK outside London and when finished was the highest residential accommodation in Europe.69 In January 2007, the independent Casino Advisory Panel awarded Manchester a licence to build the only supercasino in the UK,70 however plans were officially abandoned in February 2008.71
Since around the turn of the 21st century, Manchester has been regarded by sections of the international press,72 British public,73 and government ministers74 as being the second city of the United Kingdom.75 The BBC reports that redevelopment of recent years has heightened claims that Manchester is the second city of the UK.76 Manchester and Birmingham have traditionally been considered for this unofficial title.77
Government


 Manchester is governed by Manchester City Council. Greater Manchester County Council was abolished in 1986 so it is effectively a unitary authority. Manchester has been a member of the English Core Cities Group since its inception in 1995.78
The town of Manchester was granted a charter by Thomas Grelley in 1301 but lost its borough status in a court case of 1359. Until the 19th century, local government was largely provided by manorial courts, the last of which ended in 1846.79
From a very early time, the township of Manchester lay within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire.80 Pevsner wrote &quot;That [neighbouring] Stretford and Salford are not administratively one with Manchester is one of the most curious anomalies of England&quot;.81 A stroke of a Norman baron's pen is said to have divorced Manchester and Salford, though it was not Salford that became separated from Manchester, it was Manchester, with its humbler line of lords, that was separated from Salford.82 It was this separation that resulted in Salford becoming the judicial seat of Salfordshire, which included the ancient parish of Manchester. Manchester later formed its own Poor Law Union using the name &quot;Manchester&quot;.83 In 1792, commissioners&lt;U+2014&gt;usually known as police commissioners&lt;U+2014&gt;were established for the social improvement of Manchester. In 1838, Manchester regained its borough status, and comprised the townships of Beswick, Cheetham Hill, Chorlton upon Medlock and Hulme.84 By 1846 the borough council had taken over the powers of the police commissioners. In 1853 Manchester was granted city status in the United Kingdom.85
In 1885, Bradford, Harpurhey, Rusholme and parts of Moss Side and Withington townships became part of the City of Manchester. In 1889, the city became the county borough of Manchester, separate from the administrative county of Lancashire, and thus not governed by Lancashire County Council.86 Between 1890 and 1933, more areas were added to the city from Lancashire, including former villages such as Burnage, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Didsbury, Fallowfield, Levenshulme, Longsight, and Withington. In 1931 the Cheshire civil parishes of Baguley, Northenden and Northen Etchells from the south of the River Mersey were added.87 In 1974, by way of the Local Government Act 1972, the City of Manchester became a metropolitan district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.88 That year, Ringway, the town where Manchester Airport is located, was added to the city.
Geography


At ,  northwest of London, Manchester lies in a bowl-shaped land area bordered to the north and east by the Pennines, a mountain chain that runs the length of northern England, and to the south by the Cheshire Plain. The city centre is on the east bank of the River Irwell, near its confluences with the Rivers Medlock and Irk, and is relatively low-lying, being between  above sea level.89 The River Mersey flows through the south of Manchester. Much of the inner city, especially in the south, is flat, offering extensive views from many highrise buildings in the city of the foothills and moors of the Pennines, which can often be capped with snow in the winter months. Manchester's geographic features were highly influential in its early development as the world's first industrial city. These features are its climate, its proximity to a seaport at Liverpool, the availability of water power from its rivers, and its nearby coal reserves.90  The name Manchester, though officially applied only to the metropolitan district within Greater Manchester, has been applied to other, wider divisions of land, particularly across much of the Greater Manchester county and urban area. The &quot;Manchester City Zone&quot;, &quot;Manchester post town&quot; and the &quot;Manchester Congestion Charge&quot; are all examples of this.
For purposes of the Office for National Statistics, Manchester forms the most populous settlement within the Greater Manchester Urban Area, the United Kingdom's third largest conurbation. There is a mixture of high-density urban and suburban locations in Manchester. The largest open space in the city, at around ,91 is Heaton Park. Manchester is contiguous on all sides with several large settlements, except for a small section along its southern boundary with Cheshire. The M60 and M56 motorways pass through the south of Manchester, through Northenden and Wythenshawe respectively. Heavy rail lines enter the city from all directions, the principal destination being Manchester Piccadilly station.
Manchester experiences a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles, with warm summers and cold winters. There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year. The city's average annual rainfall is 92 compared to the UK average of ,93 and its mean rain days are 140.4 per annum,94 compared to the UK average of 154.4.95 Manchester however has a relatively high humidity level and this, along with the abundant supply of soft water, was one of the factors that led to the localisation of the textile industry in the area.96 Snowfalls are not common in the city, due to the urban warming effect. However, the Pennine and Rossendale Forest hills that surround the city to its east and north receive more snow and roads leading out of the city can be closed due to snow.97 notably the A62 road via Oldham and Standedge, the A57 (Snake Pass) towards Sheffield,98 and the M62 over Saddleworth Moor.

The United Kingdom Census 2001 showed a total resident population for Manchester of 392,819, a 9.2% decline from the 1991 census.101 Approximately 83,000 were aged under 16, 285,000 were aged 16&lt;U+2013&gt;74, and 25,000 aged 75 and over.102 According to the 2001 census, 85.2% of Manchester's population claim they have been born in the UK. Inhabitants of Manchester are known as Mancunians or Mancs for short. The census also revealed that Manchester had the second-lowest proportion of the population in employment of any local authority in the UK. In part this was due to the high proportion of students as Manchester had the highest proportion of students amongst local authorities.103 A 2007 report noted &quot;60 per cent of Manchester people are living in some of the UK's most deprived areas&quot;.104
Historically the population of Manchester began to increase rapidly during the Victorian era, peaking at 766,311 in 1931. From then the population began to decrease rapidly, due to slum clearance and the increased building of social housing overspill estates by Manchester City Council after the Second World War such as Hattersley and Langley.105
The inhabitants of Manchester, as of many other large cities, are religiously diverse. At the time of the 2001 census, 62.4% of the city's population were Christian, and 9.1% Muslim. Other religions represented less than 1% each. The proportion of people without a religion (16%) was above the national average (14.8%), with 9.7% not stating their religion.106 The Jewish population is second only to London,107 and Greater Manchester also has one of the largest Muslim populations.
 The percentage of the population in Manchester who reported themselves as living in the same household in a same-sex relationship was 0.4%, compared to the English national average of 0.2%.108
In terms of ethnic composition, the City of Manchester has the highest non-white proportion of any district in Greater Manchester. Statistics from the 2011 census showed that 66.7% of the population was White (59.3% White British, 2.4% White Irish, 0.1% Gypsy or Irish Traveller, 4.9% Other White &lt;U+2013&gt; although those of mixed European and British ancestry is unknown; there are reportedly over 25,000 Mancunians of at least partial Italian descent alone which represents 5.5% of the city's population109). 4.7% were mixed race (1.8% White and Black Caribbean, 0.9% White and Black African, 1.0% White and Asian, 1.0% Other Mixed), 17.1% Asian (2.3% Indian, 8.5% Pakistani, 1.3% Bangladeshi, 2.7% Chinese, 2.3% Other Asian), 8.6% Black (5.1% African , 1.6% Other Black), 1.9% Arab and 1.2% of other ethnic heritage.110 Kidd identifies Moss Side, Longsight, Cheetham Hill, Rusholme, as centres of population for ethnic minorities.111 Manchester's Irish Festival, including a St Patrick's Day parade, is one of Europe's largest.112 There is also a well-established Chinatown in the city with a substantial number of oriental restaurants and Chinese supermarkets. The area also attracts large numbers of Chinese students to the city who, in attending the local universities,113 contribute to Manchester having the third-largest Chinese population in Europe.114115
The Manchester Larger Urban Zone, a Eurostat measure of the functional city-region approximated to local government districts, has a population of 2,539,100 in 2004.116 In addition to Manchester itself, the LUZ includes the remainder of the county of Greater Manchester.117 The Manchester LUZ is the second largest within the United Kingdom, behind that of London.
Economy


 Manchester was at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, and was a leading centre for manufacturing. The city's economy is now largely service-based and, as of 2007, is the fastest growing in the UK, with inward investment second only to the capital.118 Manchester's State of the City Report identifies financial and professional services, life science industries, creative, cultural and media, manufacturing and communications as major activities.119 The city was ranked in 2010 as the second-best place to do business in the UK and the twelfth best in Europe.120
A 2008 report by PriceWaterhouseCoopers showed that Manchester had the third largest city economy in the United Kingdom and the 74th largest in the world, with a GDP of $85bn.121 Manchester has the largest UK office market outside London according to GVA Grimley with a quarterly average office uptake of approximately 230,000 square ft - more than the quarterly office uptake of Leeds, Liverpool and Newcastle combined and nearly 80,000 square feet more than the nearest rival Birmingham.122 The wider Greater Manchester region which Manchester is at the heart of represents over &lt;U+00A3&gt;42 billion of the UK GVA, the third largest of any English county and more than Wales or North East England.123
Manchester is a focus for businesses which serve local, regional and international markets.124 It is the fifth-largest financial centre in the United Kingdom outside London with more than 96,300 people employed in banking, finance and insurance.125 The Co-operative Group, the world's largest consumer-owned business, is based in Manchester and is one of the city's biggest employers. Legal, accounting, management consultancy and other professional and technical services exist in Manchester.126
Manchester's commercial centre is in Manchester city centre, adjacent to Piccadilly, focused on Mosley Street, Deansgate, King Street and Piccadilly. Spinningfields is a &lt;U+00A3&gt;1.5 billion mixed-use development that is expanding the district west of Deansgate. The area is designed to hold office space, retail and catering facilities, and courts. Several high-profile tenants have moved in, and a Civil Justice Centre opened in October 2007.127
Manchester is the commercial, educational and cultural focus for North West England,128 and in 2010 was ranked as the fourth biggest central retail area in the UK by sales.129 The city centre retail area contains shops from chain stores up to high-end boutiques such as Vivienne Westwood, Emporio Armani, DKNY, Harvey Nichols, Boodles, Chanel and Herm&lt;U+00E8&gt;s.  
Landmarks


 Manchester's buildings display a variety of architectural styles, ranging from Victorian to contemporary architecture. The widespread use of red brick characterises the city. Much of the architecture in the city harks back to its days as a global centre for the cotton trade.130 Just outside the immediate city centre is a large number of former cotton mills, some of which have been left virtually untouched since their closure while many have been redeveloped into apartment buildings and office space. Manchester Town Hall, in Albert Square, was built in the Gothic revival style and is considered to be one of the most important Victorian buildings in England.131
Manchester also has a number of skyscrapers built during the 1960s and 1970s, the tallest of which was the CIS Tower located near Manchester Victoria station until the Beetham Tower was completed in 2006; it is an example of the new surge in high-rise building and includes a Hilton hotel, a restaurant, and apartments. On its completion, it was the tallest building in the UK outside London, although an even taller building, the Piccadilly Tower, began construction behind Manchester Piccadilly station in early 2008 (a project in abeyance).132 The Green Building, opposite Oxford Road station, is a pioneering eco-friendly housing project, while the recently completed One Angel Square, is one of the most sustainable large buildings in the world.133 The award-winning Heaton Park in the north of the city borough is one of the largest municipal parks in Europe, covering  of parkland.134 The city has 135 parks, gardens, and open spaces.135
Two large squares hold many of Manchester's public monuments. Albert Square has monuments to Prince Albert, Bishop James Fraser, Oliver Heywood, William Ewart Gladstone,and John Bright. Piccadilly Gardens has monuments dedicated to Queen Victoria, Robert Peel, James Watt and the Duke of Wellington. The cenotaph in St Peter's Square, by Edwin Lutyens, is Manchester's main memorial to its war dead. The Alan Turing Memorial in Sackville Park commemorates his role as the father of modern computing. A larger-than-life statue of Abraham Lincoln by George Gray Barnard in the eponymous Lincoln Square (having stood for many years in Platt Fields) was presented to the city by Mr. and Mrs. Charles Phelps Taft of Cincinnati, Ohio, to mark the part that Lancashire played in the cotton famine and American Civil War of 1861&lt;U+2013&gt;1865.136 A Concorde is on display near Manchester Airport.
Manchester has six designated Local Nature Reserves which are Chorlton Water Park, Blackley Forest, Clayton Vale and Chorlton Ees, Ivy Green, Boggart Hole Clough and Highfield Country Park.137
Transport



Manchester Airport is the busiest airport outside London by a significant margin with over double the number of annual passengers of the next busiest non-London airport.

Manchester and the North of England are served by Manchester Airport. The airport is the third busiest in the United Kingdom and the largest outside the London region. Airline services exist to many destinations in Europe, North America, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East and Asia (with more destinations from Manchester than from London Heathrow).138 A second runway was opened in 2001 and there have been continued terminal improvements. Despite being a regional airport, the airport has the highest rating available, &quot;Category 10&quot; encompassing an elite group of airports which are able to handle &quot;Code F&quot; aircraft including the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8.139 From September 2010 the airport became one of only 17 airports in the world and the only airport other than Heathrow Airport to operate the Airbus A380 in the United Kingdom.140
 Manchester is well served by the rail network.141 In terms of passengers, Manchester Piccadilly was the busiest English railway station outside London in 2007/08 and the third busiest in 2008/09.142 Local operator Northern Rail and First Transpennine Express operates all over the North of England, and other national operators include East Midlands Trains and Virgin Trains. The city's other main central railway station, Manchester Victoria, had many more platforms before the arrival of the Phones 4u Arena than it now has. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway was the first passenger railway in the world. Manchester is at the centre of an extensive countywide railway network with two mainline stations: Piccadilly and Victoria. Manchester city centre is also serviced by over a dozen rail-based park and ride sites.143 In October 2007, the government announced that a feasibility study had been ordered into increasing the capacity at Piccadilly Station and turning Manchester into the rail hub of the north.144 Future improvements include a &lt;U+00A3&gt;560 million Northern Hub scheme by Network Rail to alleviate bottlenecks on Manchester's rail routes and, if constructed, the High Speed 2 link to London.
 Manchester became the first city in the UK to acquire a modern light rail tram system when the Manchester Metrolink opened in 1992. The present system mostly runs on former commuter rail lines converted for light rail use, and crosses the city centre via on-street tram lines.145 The 146-network consists of six lines with 69 stations (including five on-street tram stops in the centre).147 An expansion programme is underway148 which will create four new lines to add to the current three and will be at least 99 stops, 62 more than in 2010. Upon completion Manchester will have the largest tram system in the UK.149
The city has one of the most extensive bus networks outside London with over 50 bus companies operating in the Greater Manchester region radiating from the city. Before the deregulation of 1986, SELNEC and later GMPTE operated all buses in Manchester.150 The bus system was then taken over by GM Buses which after privatisation was split into GM Buses North and GM Buses South and at a later date these were taken over by First Greater Manchester and Stagecoach Manchester respectively.151 First Greater Manchester also operates a three route zero-fare bus service called Metroshuttle which carries commuters around Manchester's business districts.152 Stagecoach Manchester is the Stagecoach Group's largest subsidiary and operates around 690 buses and serves 87 million passengers a year.153 One of its services is the 192 bus service, the busiest bus route in the UK.154
An extensive canal network remains from the Industrial Revolution, nowadays mainly used for leisure. The Manchester Ship Canal is open, but traffic to the upper reaches is light.155

Music


The Gallagher brothers of Oasis

Bands that have emerged from the Manchester music scene include The Smiths, the Buzzcocks, The Fall, Joy Division and its successor group New Order, Oasis, elbow, Doves and Ten. Manchester was credited as the main regional driving force behind indie bands of the 1980s including Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, James, and The Stone Roses. These groups came from what became known as the &quot;Madchester&quot; scene that also centred around The Ha&lt;U+00E7&gt;ienda nightclub developed by founder of Factory Records Tony Wilson. Although from southern England, The Chemical Brothers subsequently formed in Manchester.156 Ex-Smiths Morrissey continues a successful solo career. Notable Manchester acts of the 1960s include The Hollies, Herman's Hermits, Davy Jones of the Monkees and the Bee Gees, who grew up in Chorlton.157
 Its main pop music venue is the Phones 4u Arena with over 21,000 seats, the largest arena of its type in Europe which was voted International Venue of the Year in 2007.158 In terms of concert goers, it is the busiest indoor arena in the world ahead of Madison Square Garden in New York and The O2 Arena in London, the second and third busiest respectively.159 Other major venues include the Manchester Apollo and the Manchester Academy. Smaller venues are the Band on the Wall, the Roadhouse,160 the Night and Day Caf&lt;U+00E9&gt;,161 the Ruby Lounge,162 and The Deaf Institute.163
Manchester has two symphony orchestras, the Hall&lt;U+00E9&gt; and the BBC Philharmonic. There is also a chamber orchestra, the Manchester Camerata. In the 1950s, the city was home to the so-called 'Manchester School' of classical composers, which comprised Harrison Birtwistle, Peter Maxwell Davies, David Ellis and Alexander Goehr. Manchester is a centre for musical education, with the Royal Northern College of Music and Chetham&lt;U+2019&gt;s School of Music.164 Forerunners of the RNCM were the Northern School of Music (founded 1920) and the Royal Manchester College of Music (founded 1893). The main classical venue was the Free Trade Hall on Peter Street, until the opening in 1996 of the 2,500 seat Bridgewater Hall.165
Brass band music, a tradition in the north of England, is an important part of Manchester's musical heritage;166 some of the UK's leading bands, such as the CWS Manchester Band and the Fairey Band, are from Manchester and surrounding areas, and the Whit Friday brass band contest takes place annually in the neighbouring areas of Saddleworth and Tameside.
Performing arts
Manchester has a thriving theatre, opera and dance scene, and is home to a number of large performance venues, including the Manchester Opera House, which feature large-scale touring shows and West End productions; the Palace Theatre; and the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester&lt;U+2019&gt;s former cotton exchange.
Smaller performance spaces include the Library Theatre, a producing theatre in the basement of the Central Library; the Contact Theatre; and Studio Salford. The Dancehouse is dedicated to dance productions.167 The Library Theatre closed in 2010, and will reopen in 2014 in a new custom built arts complex it will share with Cornerhouse.168
Museums and galleries
 Manchester's museums celebrate Manchester's Roman history, rich industrial heritage and its role in the Industrial Revolution, the textile industry, the Trade Union movement, women's suffrage and football. A reconstructed part of the Roman fort of Mamucium is open to the public in Castlefield. The Museum of Science and Industry, housed in the former Liverpool Road railway station, has a large collection of steam locomotives, industrial machinery and aircraft.169 The Museum of Transport displays a collection of historic buses and trams.170 Trafford Park in the neighbouring borough of Trafford is home to Imperial War Museum North.171 The Manchester Museum opened to the public in the 1880s, has notable Egyptology and natural history collections.172
 The municipally-owned Manchester Art Gallery on Mosley Street houses a permanent collection of European painting, and has one of Britain's most significant collections of Pre-Raphaelite paintings.173174
In the south of the city, the Whitworth Art Gallery displays modern art, sculpture and textiles.175 Other exhibition spaces and museums in Manchester include the Cornerhouse, the Urbis centre, the Manchester Costume Gallery at Platt Fields Park, the People's History Museum and the Manchester Jewish Museum.176
The works of Stretford-born painter , known for his &quot;matchstick&quot; paintings of industrial Manchester and Salford, can be seen in both the city and Whitworth Manchester galleries, and at the Lowry art centre in Salford Quays (in the neighbouring borough of Salford) devotes a large permanent exhibition to his works.177
Literature
In the 19th century, Manchester featured in works highlighting the changes that industrialisation had brought to Britain. These included Elizabeth Gaskell's novel Mary Barton: A Tale of Manchester Life (1848),178 and The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, written by Friedrich Engels while living and working in Manchester.179 Charles Dickens is reputed to have set his novel Hard Times in the city, and while it is partly modelled on Preston, it shows the influence of his friend Mrs Gaskell.180
Nightlife
 The night-time economy of Manchester has expanded significantly since about 1993, with investment from breweries in bars, public houses and clubs, along with active support from the local authorities.181 The more than 500 licensed premises182 in the city centre have a capacity to deal with over  visitors,183 with 110&lt;U+2013&gt; people visiting on a typical weekend night.184 The night-time economy has a value of about 185 and supports  jobs.186
The Madchester scene of the 1980s, from which groups including The Stone Roses, the Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, 808 State, James and The Charlatans emerged, was based on clubs such as The Ha&lt;U+00E7&gt;ienda.187 The period was the subject of the film 24 Hour Party People. Many of the big clubs suffered problems with organised crime at that time; Haslam describes one where staff were so completely intimidated that free admission and drinks were demanded (and given) and drugs were openly dealt.188 Following a series of drug-related violent incidents, The Hacienda closed in 1997.189
Gay Village
Public houses in the Canal Street area have had a gay clientele since at least 1940190 and now form the centre of Manchester's gay community. Since the opening of new bars and clubs, the area attracts 20,000 visitors each weekend191 and has hosted a popular festival, Manchester Pride, each August since 1991.192 The TV series Queer as Folk was set in the area.
Education

 There are three universities in the City of Manchester. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST.193 It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire.194 The University of Law has a campus in the city. It is the largest provider of vocational legal training in Europe.195
The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and the Royal Northern College of Music are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct.196 Together they have a combined population of 73 160 students in higher education,197 though almost 6 000 of these were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.198
One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515,199 as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant grammar school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system.200 Its previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music. There are three schools nearby: William Hulme's Grammar School, Withington Girls' School and Manchester High School for Girls.
In 2010, the Manchester Local Education Authority was ranked last out of Greater Manchester's ten LEAs &lt;U+2013&gt; and 147th out of 150 in the country LEAs &lt;U+2013&gt; based on the percentage of pupils attaining at least five A* grades at General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) including maths and English (38.6 per cent compared with the national average of 50.7 per cent). The LEA also had the highest occurrence of absences, with 11.11 per cent of &quot;half day sessions missed by pupils&quot;, above the national average of 5.8 per cent.201202 Of the schools in the LEA with 30 or more pupils, four had 90 per cent or more pupils achieving at least five A*&lt;U+2013&gt;C grades at GCSE including maths and English (Manchester High School for Girls, St Bede's College, Manchester Islamic High School for Girls, and The King David High School) while three managed 25 per cent or below (Plant Hill Arts College, North Manchester High School for Boys, Brookway High School and Sports College).203
Sport

 Manchester is well known for being a city of sport.204 The city has two Premier League football clubs - Manchester City and Manchester United.205 Manchester City's ground is the City of Manchester Stadium (also known as the Etihad Stadium for sponsorship purposes); its former ground, Maine Road was demolished in 2003. The City of Manchester Stadium was initially built as the main athletics stadium for the 2002 Commonwealth Games and was subsequently reconfigured into a football stadium before Manchester City's arrival. Manchester United are situated at Old Trafford in the neighbouring Greater Manchester borough of Trafford, the largest club football ground in the United Kingdom.206 Manchester has hosted every domestic and international football competition including the FIFA World Cup (1966), UEFA European Football Championship (1996), Olympic Football (2012), UEFA Champions League Final (2003), UEFA Cup Final (2008), five FA Cup Finals (1893, 1911, 1915, 1970) and three League Cup Finals (1977, 1978, 1984).
First class sporting facilities were built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, including the City of Manchester Stadium, the National Squash Centre and the Manchester Aquatics Centre.207 Manchester has competed twice to host the Olympic Games, beaten by Atlanta for 1996 and Sydney for 2000. The National Cycling Centre includes a velodrome, BMX Arena and Mountainbike trials and is the home of British Cycling, UCI ProTeam Team Sky and Sky Track Cycling. The Manchester Velodrome was built as a part of the bid for the 2000 games and has become a catalyst for British success in cycling.208 The velodrome hosted the UCI Track Cycling World Championships for a record third time in 2008. The National Indoor BMX Arena (2,000 capacity) adjacent to the velodrome opened in 2011. The Phones 4u Arena hosted the FINA World Swimming Championships in 2008.209 Manchester Cricket Club evolved into Lancashire County Cricket Club and play at Old Trafford Cricket Ground. Manchester also hosted the World Squash Championships in 2008,210 and also hosted the 2010 World Lacrosse Championship in July 2010.211 Future sporting events to be hosted in Manchester include the 2013 Ashes series, 2013 Rugby League World Cup and 2015 Rugby World Cup.
Media


 The ITV franchisee Granada Television which has headquarters in Quay Street212 produces Coronation Street,213 local news and programmes for North West England. Although its influence has waned Granada had been described as 'the best commercial television company in the world'.214215
Manchester was one of the BBC's three main centres in England.216 Programmes including Mastermind,217 and Real Story,218 were made at New Broadcasting House. The Cutting It series set in the city's Northern Quarter and The Street were set in Manchester219 as was Life on Mars. The first edition of Top of the Pops was broadcast from a studio in Rusholme on New Year's Day 1964.220 Manchester was the regional base for BBC One North West Region programmes before it relocated to MediaCityUK in nearby Salford Quays.221222 The Manchester television channel, Channel M, owned by the Guardian Media Group operated from 2000 but closed in 2012.223224 Manchester is also covered by two internet television channels: Quays News and Manchester.tv. The city will also have a new terrestrial channel from January 2014 when YourTV Manchester, who won the OFCOM licence bid in February 2013 begins its first broadcast.
 The city has the highest number of local radio stations outside London including BBC Radio Manchester, Key 103, Galaxy, Piccadilly Magic 1152, Real Radio North West, 100.4 Smooth FM, Capital Gold 1458, 96.2 The Revolution, NMFM (North Manchester FM) and Xfm.225226 Student radio stations include Fuse FM at the University of Manchester and MMU Radio at the Manchester Metropolitan University.227 A community radio network is coordinated by Radio Regen, with stations covering Ardwick, Longsight and Levenshulme (All FM 96.9) and Wythenshawe (Wythenshawe FM 97.2).228 Defunct radio stations include Sunset 102, which became Kiss 102, then Galaxy Manchester), and KFM which became Signal Cheshire (now Imagine FM). These stations and pirate radio played a significant role in the city's house music culture, the Madchester scene, which was based in clubs like The Ha&lt;U+00E7&gt;ienda.
The Guardian newspaper was founded in 1821 as The Manchester Guardian. Its head office is still in the city, though many of its management functions were moved to London in 1964.229 Its sister publication, the Manchester Evening News, has the largest circulation of a UK regional evening newspaper. It is free in the city centre on Thursdays and Fridays, but paid for in the suburbs. Despite its title, it is available all day.230 The Metro North West is available free at Metrolink stops, rail stations and other busy locations. The MEN group distributes several local weekly free papers.231 For many years most of the national newspapers had offices in Manchester: The Daily Telegraph, Daily Express, Daily Mail, The Daily Mirror, The Sun. Only The Daily Sport remains based in Manchester. At its height,  journalists were employed, though in the 1980s office closures began and today the &quot;second Fleet Street&quot; is no more.232 An attempt to launch a Northern daily newspaper, the North West Times, employing journalists made redundant by other titles, closed in 1988.233 Another attempt was made with the North West Enquirer, which hoped to provide a true &quot;regional&quot; newspaper for the North West, much in the same vein as the Yorkshire Post does for Yorkshire or The Northern Echo does for the North East; it folded in October 2006.234 There are several local lifestyle magazines, including YQ Magazine and Moving Manchester.235
Twin cities and consulates
Manchester has formal twinning arrangements (or &quot;friendship agreements&quot;) with several places.236237238 In addition, the British Council maintains a metropolitan centre in Manchester.239 Although not an official twin city, Tampere, Finland is known as &quot;the Manchester of Finland&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; or &quot;Manse&quot; for short. Similarly, Osaka is nicknamed as &quot;The Manchester of Japan&quot;, and Ahmedabad, India established itself as the centre of a booming textile industry, which earned it the nickname &quot;the Manchester of India&quot;.240241

Manchester is home to the largest group of consuls in the UK outside London. The expansion of international trade links during the Industrial Revolution led to the introduction of the first consuls in the 1820s and since then over 800, from all parts of the world, have been based in Manchester. Manchester has remained (in consular terms at least) the second city of the UK for two centuries, and hosts consular services for most of the north of England.242
