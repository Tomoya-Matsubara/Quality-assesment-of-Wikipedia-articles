The Type U 66 was a ship class class of five submarines or U-boats operated by the German Imperial Navy lang-de Kaiserliche Marine during World War I. The class is alternately referred to as the U-66-class or the Type UD. The class was built by Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft Germaniawerft of Kiel  to their 506d design as the U-7-class for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The five boats were sold to the Imperial Germany Navy at the beginning of World War I when it was thought impossible for the submarines to reach the Mediterranean for delivery to Austria-Hungary.

The Austro-Hungarian Navy, after competitively evaluating six submarines of three foreign designs, selected the Germaniwerft 506d or Type UD design over a design from Whitehead & Co. for the U-7 class. The boats, numbered U-7 to  U-11, were designed to be convert 228 ft m long and displacement ship displace between convert 695 & 885 t ST when surfaced and submerged. They were to be armed with five torpedo tubes and a deck gun. For propulsion the design called for twin diesel engines for surface running and twin electric motors for subsurface movement. The Austro-Hungarian Navy ordered the boats in February 1913 and construction began on the first boats in November.

After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Austro-Hungarian Navy became convinced that delivery of the still-unfinished submarines to the Mediterranean via Gibraltar would be impossible. As a result, they sold the five boats to the Imperial German Navy in November 1914. The German Navy assigned the numbers U-66 to U-70 to the five submarines and had them redesigned and reconstructed to their specifications. These changes, which included a larger deck gun, increased the displacement of the U-boats by almost convert 100 t ST surfaced and nearly convert 50 t ST submerged.

All five boats saw active service, and four sank 18 or more ships. Only SMU U-68  2, sunk six days into her first war patrol in March 1916, had no successes. Two other boats, SMU U-66  2 and SMU U-69  2 disappeared in 1917. The remaining two U-boats, SMU U-67  2 and SMU U-70  2, were surrendered to the United Kingdom and were ship breaking broken up by 1921.

 Background 
In 1904, the Austro-Hungarian Navy, after allowing the navies of other countries to pioneer submarine developments,Gardiner, p. 340. ordered the Austrian Naval Technical Committee lang-de Marinetechnisches Komitee or MTK to produce a submarine design.Sieche, p. 16. When the Navy rejected the January 1905 MTK design and other designs submitted as part of a public competition as impracticable, they instead opted to order two submarines each of designs by Simon Lake, Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft Germaniawerft, and John Philip Holland for a competitive evaluation.The Lake design became the Austro-Hungarian U-1 class submarine Austria-Hungary U-1 class, the Germaniawerft design became the U-3 class submarine Austria-Hungary U-3 class, and the Holland design became the U-5 class submarine Austria-Hungary U-5 class.

Based on the trials results, the Austro-Hungarian Navy determined the characteristics that the next generation of Austro-Hungarian submarines should have. They were looking for a hull submarine double-hulled submarine of about convert 500 t ST displacement ship displacement with diesel propulsion. They also wanted a surface speed of between convert 16 & 18 knots km/h, and for the boat to be armed with between three and five convert 45 cm in 1 abbr=on torpedo tubes. The Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft Germaniawerft 506d design, also known as the Type UD, for the U-7 class over the Type 48 design submitted by Whitehead & Co., primarily because of the lower cost. The Navy ordered five boats on 1 February 1913.

 Design 
The U-7 class was seen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy as an improved version of its U-3 class submarine Austria-Hungary U-3 class, which was also a Germaniawerft design.The U-3 class submarine Austria-Hungary U-3-class submarines, however, were less than half the displacement and nearly convert 90 ft m shorter than the U-7 design. See: Gardiner, pp. 34243. As designed for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, the boats were to displace ship displace convert 695 t ST on the surface and convert 885 t ST while submerged. The hull submarine doubled-hulled boats were to be convert 228 ft m long length overall OA with a beam nautical beam of convert 20 ft 8 in m and a draft hull draft of convert 12 ft 5 in m. The Austrian specifications called for two shafts with twin diesel engines convert 2300 bhp total for surface running at up to convert 17 knots km/h, and twin electric motors convert 1240 shp total for a maximum of convert 11 knots km/h when submerged.

The boats were designed with five convert 45 cm in 1 abbr=on torpedo tubes; four located in the bow, one in the stern. The boats' armament was to also include a single convert 6.6 cm in abbr=on/26 deck gun.

 Construction 
After the Austro-Hungarian Navy's 1 February 1913 order, the first two boats, U-7 and U-8, were keel laying laid down at Germaniawerft on 1 November. U-9 was laid down at the end of December, and the final two boats, U-10 and U-11 were both begun in February 1914.Helgason, Gumundur. http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=66 WWI U-boats: U 66, http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=67 WWI U-boats: U 67, http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=68 WWI U-boats: U 68, http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=69 WWI U-boats: U 69, http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=70 WWI U-boats: U 70. U-Boat War in World War I. Uboat.net. Retrieved on 6 December 2008. Construction of the boats was slated to be complete within 29 to 33 months.

None of the submarines were complete when World War I began in August 1914. With the boats under construction at Kiel, the Austrians became convinced that it would be impossible to take delivery of the boats, which would need to be towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British territory.The Germaniawerft-built U-3 class submarine Austria-Hungary U-3 class boats had been towed from Kiel to Pula Pola via Gibraltar in 1909. See: Sieche, p. 19. As a result, the five boats of the class were transferred to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914 after the advance payment of 2 million Austro-Hungarian krone Kronen had been returned.In April 1915, just five months later, the German SMU U-21 Germany 2 successfully entered the Mediterranean through the Straits of Gibraltar, proving that delivery would have been possible after all. See: Gardiner, p. 343. Germaniawerft was then awarded Kriegsauftrag D, hence the type was known as UD.

After their purchase, the boats were assigned the numbers U-66 to U-70, and the class became known as the U66 type. The Imperial German Navy had the submarines redesigned and reconstructed to German standards, which increased the surface displacement by convert 96 MT ST and the submerged by convert 48 MT ST. The torpedo load was increased by a third, from 9 to 12, and the deck gun was upgraded from the convert 66 mm in abbr=on gun originally specified to an convert 88 mm in abbr=on one.

U-66 was launch ship launched on 22 April 1915, the first of the class, and was followed by the other four about one every three weeks, with the last boat, U-70, hitting the water on 20 July. The boats were all completed and commission ship commissioned into the Imperial German Navy between July and September.

 Service career 
All the boats of the U-66 class saw active service, and all but one boat, SMU U-68  2, had wartime successes; SMU U-69  2 and SMU U-70  2 both sank over 100,000 tons of Allied shipping. U-68 was sunk by the British Q-ship HMS Farnborough in March 1916, and was the first boat of the class to be lost during the war. U-69  and U-66 were lost in July and September 1917, respectively.Messimer, pp. 85, 88. SMS U-67  2 sub=y and U-70 both survived the war and were surrendered to the United Kingdom in November 1918, and both were broken up by 1921.
