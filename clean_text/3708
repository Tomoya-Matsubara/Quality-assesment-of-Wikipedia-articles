Plot
The Simpson family are busy preparing for Bart's birthday party. Homer sees a commercial on television for a prank microphone called the Superstar Celebrity Microphone that can be used to tap into localized radio systems and instantly decides to buy one for Bart. Subsequently, Bart experiences a crushingly disappointing birthday party when all his gifts turn out to be useless things like a cactus, a label maker, and a new suit. At first he is also disappointed by the microphone, but later finds a use for it in creating practical jokes, such as tricking the Flanders children into believing that God is talking to them, listening in on Lisa and Janey's conversations about boys, and persuading Homer that aliens have invaded Earth.
Bart throws a radio down a well and speaks through it with the microphone, tricking the townspeople into thinking an orphan named Timmy O'Toole has fallen down the well. Although they are unable to get &quot;Timmy&quot; out, as the well is too small for any adult to fit in, the entire town offers moral support and do everything they can to give him hope. Krusty even gets musician Sting to join other celebrities in recording a charity single, &quot;We're Sending Our Love Down the Well&quot;. However, Bart&lt;U+2014&gt;after realizing that his name is on the radio thanks to his label-maker&lt;U+2014&gt;falls into the well while trying to retrieve it. When the townspeople find out, he confesses that Timmy O'Toole does not exist. Angry at being tricked, the townspeople leave Bart in the well. At the same time, &quot;We're Sending Our Love Down The Well&quot; dramatically falls off the number one spot to be replaced by &quot;I Do Believe We're Naked&quot; by Funky See, Funky Do.
Despite efforts by Homer and Marge to mobilize a rescue operation, the entire town remains outraged at Bart and refuse to help. Finally, Homer has had enough&lt;U+2014&gt;he decides to dig a tunnel and rescue Bart himself. Groundskeeper Willie sees this and joins Homer. With a little help from Sting, and several residents who put their anger aside, an excavation operation is started. A regretful Bart is finally rescued and Willie puts up a small warning sign near the well the next morning to prevent future incidents.
Production
 &quot;Radio Bart&quot; was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Carlos Baeza, though series creator Matt Groening came up with the idea for it. The episode was based on the 1951 film Ace in the Hole, which sees the story of a former journalist exploiting a story about a man trapped in a cave to re-jump start his career.1 Vitti did not watch the film until after the episode had been written; &quot;[Groening] came in out of nowhere and just gave me, start to finish, the whole story.&quot;2 Vitti said renting the film was the first thing he did after finishing the script. He remarked, &quot;It's surprisingly hard to rent. It's really dark and funny and it's by Billy Wilder, so you think it would be in stores, but it's not. It was hard to find.&quot;3
The producers approached singer Bruce Springsteen to appear in the episode because he had participated to the charity song &quot;We Are the World&quot;, which &quot;We're Sending Our Love Down The Well&quot; is based on. Springsteen declined so the producers offered the role to American musician Sting instead.456 Executive producer Al Jean said Sting is one of his favorite guest stars that have appeared on the show and he &quot;couldn't have been better. He was really funny.&quot;7 The Simpsons director David Silverman said Sting's appearance in the episode worked for his persona because he has campaigned for political and social causes in real life.8 Sting was staying in New York City at the time of the episode's recording so Vitti flew there to record the lines with him.9
The television commercial for the Superstar Celebrity Microphone that Homer watches was inspired by a popular Ronco commercial from the late 1980s, in which a boy becomes popular and &quot;scores with the girls&quot; by using his microphone to be on the radio. Both commercials feature a boy passing by two women and saying, &quot;Hey, good-looking, I'll pick you up later,&quot; a line the staff thought was &quot;hilarious&quot;.10 In the Superstar Celebrity Microphone commercial, the boy sings the 1975 song &quot;Convoy&quot; by C. W. McCall into the microphone. The producers originally wanted him to sing &quot;The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; by Gordon Lightfoot, a song about the sinking of the bulk carrier S.S. Edmund Fitzgerald on Lake Superior. Vitti said the reason the song was not used was because Lightfoot had made it so that in order to clear the copyrights for song, they would have to get permission from the families of the twenty-nine passengers who died on the ship.11 In another scene, Bart uses his radio to make Homer believe aliens are invading Earth; Homer was originally supposed to create a punch made from Kool-Aid and rat poison so that he and the family could commit suicide before the aliens arrived. The writers thought this scene was &quot;too dark&quot; and changed it to Homer getting a shotgun and going after the aliens, before finding out that Bart is playing a trick on him.12
Cultural references
&quot;Radio Bart&quot; features several pop culture references. At the beginning of the episode, Homer watches the show Soul Train and its host Don Cornelius on television.13 The Wall E. Weasel pizza restaurant that Bart celebrates his birthday at is a parody of the family pizza restaurant franchise Chuck E. Cheese's.1415 The episode also parodies charity singles. The song &quot;We're Sending Our Love Down the Well&quot; is a spoof of &quot;We Are the World&quot;,161718 and the idea of celebrities singing it is based on USA for Africa, the name under which forty-five famous artists recorded &quot;We Are the World&quot;.1920 Funky-See, Funky-Do with their hit &quot;I Do Believe We're Naked&quot; resembles the music style of Milli Vanilli.2122
This episode is similar to an incident involving Jessica McClure, who fell into a well in Midland, Texas on October 14, 1987.23 One citizen suggests using chocolate attached to a fish-hook to save Timmy, a reference to a character from the 1976 film Jaws.24 Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times used &quot;Radio Bart&quot; as an example of the Simpsons writers ability to predict the future. He said &quot;Radio Bart&quot; aired more than seven years before Princess Diana's death that &quot;provoked the exact same celebrity posturing and media panic&quot; as seen in the episode.25 Timmy's story is eventually bumped off the front page when the media discovers a squirrel who resembles Abraham Lincoln.26 Kay said Princess Diana's death was &quot;bumped by a fund-raising imbroglio involving Vice President Al Gore, a political figure who resembles oatmeal, which squirrels sometimes eat.&quot;27
Reception
 In its original American broadcast, &quot;Radio Bart&quot; finished 31st in ratings for the week of January 6&lt;U+2013&gt;12, 1992, with a Nielsen Rating of 14.1, equivalent to approximately 13 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.28 The episode was nominated for an Emmy Award in the &quot;Outstanding Animated Program&quot; category, but lost to Will Vinton's A Claymation Easter on CBS. &quot;Radio Bart&quot; was submitted for consideration because it was the staff's favorite episode of the season.29 Executive producer Al Jean said they thought this episode or an episode of Ren &amp; Stimpy would win and they were &quot;absolutely floored&quot; when neither did.30 The Simpsons director David Silverman said he thinks The Simpsons and Ren &amp; Stimpy split the vote, allowing A Claymation Easter to win the Emmy.31
Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It was named the second best episode of The Simpsons by Kirk Baird of the Las Vegas Sun32 and the third best episode by Sarah Culp of The Quindecim.33 DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented: &quot;Despite the potential for some heavy-handed moralizing, 'Radio Bart' provides a terrific show. From Bart&lt;U+2019&gt;s crappy birthday to his pranks to the public reaction to Timmy&lt;U+2019&gt;s trapping, the humor flies fast and furious in this excellent episode. It&lt;U+2019&gt;s one of the better ones.&quot;34 The Daily Telegraph characterized the episode as one of ten best episodes of The Simpsons.35 DVD Times's Chris Kaye said &quot;Radio Bart&quot; is &quot;another demonstration of the series' knack for cultural references, parodying the Billy Wilder movie Ace in the Hole.&quot;36 Entertainment Weekly ranked &quot;Radio Bart&quot; as the twentieth best episode of The Simpsons and commented that &quot;it's a media parody so sharp, we're still stinging a bit.&quot;37
Monsters and Critics's Trent McMartin praised Sting's guest performance, calling it &quot;humorous&quot;.38 Total Film's Nathan Ditum ranked his performance as the 11th best guest appearance in the show's history.39 The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, commented that &quot;The Police had a song called 'Canary Down the Mine', and Sting had made a point of campaigning for good causes, which explains why he was singled out in this sharp critique of celebrity posturing and media panic.&quot;40 Tom Nawrocki of Rolling Stone rated the &quot;We're Sending Our Love Down the Well&quot; song as one of the best musical moments in the history of the show.41
Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict gave the episode a less positive review, commenting that it &quot;is always considered a fan favorite, but there is a real dated feel to this entire child down the well narrative. Maybe it's the labeling gun gift Bart uses. Maybe it's the Chuck-e-Cheese style theme restaurant Bart has his birthday party in. Maybe it's the appearance of long since dried up Sting and the whole 'We Are the World' idealism which is all but dead now (thankfully). Whatever it is, it robs this episode of a great deal of its initial impact, leaving us with a funny, but not fabulous, offering.&quot;42 Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 3/5 rating and said it is &quot;unbalanced, with some clever dialogue and a fantastic climax (featuring Sting), but the overall pacing of the plot leaves too many lulls for this to be a standout episode.&quot;43
