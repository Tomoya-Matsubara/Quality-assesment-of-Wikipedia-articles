Early career
He started his career in his native South Africa at Supersport United, before transferring to Manning Rangers where he won the golden boot during the 1997&lt;U+2013&gt;98 Premier Soccer League season with 11 goals. In the 2003/2004 season he also led with 8 goals.1
Waitakere United
He would move next to New Zealand, with ambitions to play for New Zealand Knights in the newly formed Australian/New Zealand A-League. However this never eventuated, and he signed with new New Zealand Football Championship team Waitakere United. This would ultimately be a successful move, scoring 15 goals in the 21 rounds, and earning the Golden Boot.2
Auckland City FC
At the end of what was a good debut season with Waitakere United, he made the move to Auckland City FC. He made an immediate impact for the Auckland Club, socring frequently for the club in both the NZFC and the Oceania Champions League.
In 2008 he shocked the New Zealand footballing community, when it was revealed that he had been battling with cancer for 3 years, which would explain the 3 months he spent on the sideline.
